These images depict three basic components of epidemics, namely infectious diseases, information about diseases, and human preventive behavior against diseases. From a perspective of diffusion theory, each of the three components can be viewed as a spreading process throughout a population. The disease could be transmitted through person-to-person contact, the information is circulated by communication channels, and the preventive behavior can spread via the \u2018social contagion\u2019 process, such as the observational learning. The interactions among these three diffusion processes shape the scale and dynamics of epidemics (Funk and Jansen, 2013, Lau et al., 2005, Mao and Yang, 2011).",

A majority of existing models have been focused on the diffusion of diseases alone, assuming a \u2018passive\u2019 population that would not respond to diseases (Bian et al., 2012, Eubank et al., 2004, Longini et al., 2004). This is rarely the case because it is natural for people to protect themselves when realizing disease risks (Eames et al., 2012, Ferguson, 2007). To improve, there has been much recent interest in modeling two diffusion processes in an epidemic, either a behavior-disease diffusion (House, 2011, Mao and Bian, 2011, Vardavas et al., 2007), or an information (awareness)-disease diffusion (Funk et al., 2009, Kiss et al., 2010). These \u2018dual-diffusion\u2019 models have made a remarkable progress toward the reality, but none of them consider all the three diffusion processes together. The third diffusion process has often been neglected or simplified.",

The lack of such models prevents researchers from unveiling a full picture of an epidemic, and inevitably introduces biases into the deep understanding on human-disease systems. For epidemiologists, it is of difficulty to explore how one diffusion process influences the other two, and what key factors govern the three diffusion processes. Without a complete model, health policy makers would not be able to systematically evaluate social-network interventions for disease control, such as mass-media campaigns and behavior promotion strategies. As in the age of information, the fusion of disease-behavior-information in epidemic modeling becomes a pressing task in public health.",

            "text": "The proposed model conceptualizes a typical epidemic as one network structure, three paralleling diffusion processes, and three external factors (Fig. 1\n). First, the contacts among individuals form a network structure as a basis for diffusion and interaction. Second, infectious diseases are transmitted through direct contacts among individuals (the middle layer). Disease control strategies, such as vaccination program, case treatment and isolation, pose external effects on the disease diffusion. Third, the diffusion of diseases prompts the \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d discussion among individuals, which disseminates the information concerning diseases and prevention (the upper layer). The outbreak of diseases may also stimulate various mass media, such as TV, newspapers, and radio, to propagate relevant information, thus accelerating the diffusion of information. Fourth, people being informed start to consider and make a decision toward the adoption of preventive behaviors. The adoptive behavior of individuals also influences their network neighbors to adopt, widely known as the \u201csocial contagion\u201d effects (the lower layer). The diffusion of preventive behaviors, in turn, limits the dispersion of diseases and speeds the diffusion of information. Behavioral interventions, as an external factor, can be implemented by health agencies to promote preventive behaviors, such as educational, incentive and role-model strategies. During an epidemic, these three diffusion processes interact with one another and form negative/positive feedbacks loops in the human-disease system, shown as arrows between layers in Fig. 1. Manipulated by the three external factors, these three diffusion processes, hereinafter named as the triple-diffusion process, determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of an epidemic.",

To represent the contact network, individuals are modeled as nodes and are linked to one another through their daily contacts (as network ties). The individualized contacts are assumed to take place during three time periods in a day at four types of locations (Mao & Bian, 2010), namely the daytime at workplaces, the nighttime at homes, and the pastime at service places or neighbor households (Fig. 2\n). Individuals travel between the three time periods and the four types of locations to carry out their daily activities, thus having contact with different groups of individuals and exposing themselves to disease infection.

Statistical distributions derived from these datasets, such as distributions of family size, workplace size, and household daily trips, are used to ensure the validity of value assignments. To differentiate the weekdays and weekends, individuals are not assigned to work (or schools) at weekends except those who work in service-oriented businesses (such as restaurants and grocery stores). Those who do not work during the weekends would have increased trips to service-oriented businesses. The completion of assignments forms three linked populations, including a nighttime population at homes, a daytime population at workplaces, and a pastime population at service places or neighbor households. The three populations represent the same set of individuals, but at different locations and time periods of a day. Individuals have contact with a number of other individuals at a same time period and same location, forming a spatio-temporally varying network. The simulated network has an average of 16.9 daily contacts per person, consistent with the observed number (16.8) from empirical studies (Beutels et al., 2006, Edmunds, 1997, Fu, 2005).",

First, the model assumes that symptomatic individuals has a 75% likelihood to adopt flu prophylaxis to mitigate the symptoms and reduce their infectivity (McIsaac, Levine, & Goel, 1998). Second, the preventive efficacy of flu prophylaxis (E\nprevention in Equation (1)) is set to 70% and 40% for susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, indicating that their likelihood of being infected or infecting others can be reduced by such amount (Hayden, 2001, Longini et al., 2004).

Those statistical distributions were derived based on a health behavioral survey, whose details are provided in the Supplementary Document.

The first possible reason is that many sick people may choose self-care instead of seeing a doctor, and thus cannot be reported.

Therefore, the number of influenza cases is often highly under-reported, and a complete data is rather difficult to collect.

A possible reason is the wide coverage of modern mass media over the population, enabling a faster spread of information than the disease. At the beginning of the epidemic, only a few influenza cases occurred and a vast majority of people were unaware of the disease. As the diffusion of influenza took off (January 2nd\u20139th), individuals started to notice the disease problem and discuss with each other. When the epidemic became more sensational and drawn attention from the mass media (January 10th\u201316th), the awareness curve climbed steeply and reached the peak in four weeks. Fig. 7 implies that overseeing the diffusion of disease information, such as the Google flu trend, could warn the public 1\u20132 week earlier before the epidemic peak actually occurs.",

            "text": "Still in its infancy, the triple-diffusion model has several limitations in its design and implementation. First, the contact network used in the model could be further refined into three different but partially overlapping networks, namely an infection network, information network, and influential network, each channels a diffusion process. Admittedly, the model would be more realistic, but building these networks requires extensive social survey to collect relevant data, which is often costly and time consuming. Recent work on extracting social networks from Facebook and Twitter may be a promising method to address this issue (Lewis, Kaufman, Gonzalez, Wimmer, & Christakis, 2008). Second, the effects of mass media is formulated as a simple formula, but could be more complicated if further considering various types of media and their corresponding coverage. Probably, a sophisticated function could depict the human communications better, such as an exponential decay or a power-law decay function. Life style data of individuals may be helpful to identify their preferred media and delineate the media coverage. Third, the discussion rate is assumed homogenous over the study area. This rate may vary between age groups, occupations, and personalities. A health behavior survey may need to estimate discussion rates for different groups of individuals. Fourth, there would be a certain amount of uncertainty if the model was used to predict the future influenza outbreaks. If new census data and travel survey data were filled in, this model could reasonably predict the timeline and scale of a future outbreak of seasonal influenza. However, for a pandemic influenza, such as the new H1N1, most of the model parameters should be adjusted to account for the highly infectious virus, the faster circulation of information, and possibly distinct response of individuals toward preventive behaviors. All these limitations warrant a future study. After all, the goal of modeling is not to predict what exactly happen during an epidemic, but rather to observe how the epidemic may proceed and encourage appropriate questions. In this sense, the model results provide valuable knowledge regarding city-wide epidemics.",

The conceptual framework integrates three interactive processes: the diffusion of influenza, the diffusion of information, and that of preventive behavior, upon a human social network. The agent-based approach, network model, theories from epidemiology, information and behavioral sciences are used to formulate the conceptual framework into a working model. For illustration purposes, the model is implemented in an urbanized area with a large population. Compared to the reported data, the proposed model reasonably replicates the observed trends of influenza infection and online query frequency. The model, thus, could be a valid and effective tool for exploring various control policies.",

First, the proposed triple-diffusion framework is a significant advancement to previous disease-only models and dual-diffusion models, such as Bian and Mao's work. The fusion of disease, information, and human behavior allows a more comprehensive 3D cubic view of the human-disease system, which can only be studied from a 2D planar perspective before. The increase of one dimension exposes much more details of an epidemic and thus enables a deeper understanding of this complex system, for example, the interactive mechanisms among the three diffusion processes. The proposed modeling framework can flexibly accommodate the mobile phone tracking data and the latest census data to improve the accuracy of modeled daytime and nighttime populations. The online social networking data (from Facebook and Twitter) can also be included to modify the way of communications between individuals, as well as the personal influence between them.",

The evaluation results will enrich the family of disease control polices, and help the public health overcome the socio-economic challenges posed by potential influenza outbreaks.",
