The direct estimation of the doubling time of the epidemic gave a mean of 3.6 days (varying from 1.0 to 7.7). Figure 1B shows the Bayesian birth-death skyline plot of the R e estimates with 95% HPD and indicates that R e increased from less than 1 (mean, 0.8; 95% HPD, 0.3-1.3) to a mean value of 2.4 (95% HPD, 1.5-3.5) in December 2019, and has since remained at this value. The estimation allowing a single R e gave a mean value of 1.85 (95% HPD, 1.37-2.4). Table 1 shows the parameters estimated using the birth-death skyline plot. The epidemic originated an estimated mean of 3.7 months (CI, 3-4) before the present (BP), corresponding to October to November 2019, before the root tree (3.6 months BP). The estimated recovery rate (the time to becoming noninfectious) was One of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is R 0 (ie, the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a microorganism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (R e ). R 0 is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of SARS-CoV-2 R 0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to more than 7 during the first phases of the epidemic. 10, 14 Recently developed evolutionary models have made it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters on the basis of phylogenesis, 9, 15 and a coalescent and birth-death methods were used to estimate R 0 and the changes in the R e of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic during a short period of time. This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R 0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range, 3.6-5.8), and the birth-death skyline analysis showed an increase in R e from less than 1 to 2.4 (CI, 1.5-3.5) during December 2019.",

In December, the virus acquired a more efficient mode of human-to-human transmission (ie, through droplets), causing exponential growth also detected by the skyline.",

The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogenetically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (https://www.gisaid.org/). Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the CIs are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan.",

The virus' phylogeny, evolutionary rates, times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and demographic growth were coestimated in a Bayesian framework using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in v.1.8.4 of the BEAST package. 5 Different coalescent priors and molecular clock models (constant population size, exponential growth, and a Bayesian skyline plot [BSP]) were tested using strict and relaxed molecular clock models. Given the large credibility interval (CI) and high level of uncertainty due to very close sampling dates, all the estimates were made using days as the unit of time and a normal prior with substitution rates obtained from our preliminary estimates (mean rate 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 subs/site/day, with a standard deviation of 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). The MCMC analysis was run until convergence with sampling every 100 000 generations. Convergence was assessed by estimating the effective sampling size (ESS) after 10% burn-in using Tracer v.1.7 software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), and accepting ESS values of 300 or more. The uncertainty of the estimates is indicated by 95% highest marginal likelihoods estimated 6 by path sampling (PS)/stepping stone (SS) methods. 7 The final trees were summarized by selecting the tree with the maximum product of posterior probabilities (pp) (maximum clade credibility) after a 10% burn-in using Tree Annotator v.1.8.4 (included in the BEAST package) and were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).",

For the birth-death analysis, one and two intervals and a lognormal prior to R e , with a mean (M) of 0.0 and a variance (S) of 1.0 were chosen, which allows the R e values to change between less than 1 (0.193) and more than 5. A normal prior with M = 48.7 and S = 15 (corresponding to a 95% interval from 24.0 to 73.4) was used for the rate of becoming uninfectious. These values are expressed as units per year and reflect the inverse of the time of infectiousness (5.3-19 days; mean, 7.5) according to the serial interval estimated by Li et al. 10 Sampling probability (\u03c1) was estimated assuming a prior \u03b2 (\u03b1 = 1.0 and \u03b2 = 999), corresponding to a minority of the sampled cases (between 10 \u22125 and 10 \u22123 ). The origin of the epidemic was estimated using a normal prior with M = 0.1 and S = 0.05 in units per year. The MCMC analyses were run for 30 million generations and sampled every 3000 steps. Convergence was assessed on the basis of ESS values (ESS > 200). Uncertainty in the estimates was indicated by 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. The mean growth rate was calculated on the basis of the birth and recovery rates (r = \u03bb \u2212 \u03b4), and the doubling time was estimated by the equation: doubling time = ln(2)/r. 11 3 | RESULTS The sequence analyses under a relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) or strict molecular clock showed that the former performed better as assessed by using BF with PS and SS (strict vs relaxed molecular clock BF(PS) = \u22128.66 and BF(SS) = \u221210.7 for relaxed clock). Comparison of the different demographic models showed that the BSP model best fitted the data (BSP vs exponential growth BF(PS) = 7.3 and BF(SS) = 8.78 for BSP; BSP vs constant population size BF(PS)= 8.3; and BF(SS) = 10.7 for BSP). The estimated mean evolutionary rate was 2.15 \u00d7 10 \u22126 subs/site/day (95% HPD, 3.22 \u00d7 10 \u22127 -4.18 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), corresponding to 7.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 subs/ site/year (95% HPD, 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -15 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). The estimated mean tMRCA corresponding to the root of the tree dated 73 days before the end of January 2020 (95% HPD, 32.5-142.3), corresponding to 18 November 2019 (95% HPD, 10 September 2019-28 December 2019).",

The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and to share these findings with other scientists.The temporal reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth-death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,12,13 and the recent estimates concerning SARS-CoV-2 (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-67-genomes-08-feb-2020/356).",
