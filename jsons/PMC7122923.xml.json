The work environment and the nature of work itself are both important influences on health, safety and well-being (HSW). As a result, workplace health and safety or occupational health and safety have been key areas of concern for many years. Traditionally, more focus has been placed on safety concerns in the workplace while health concerns became more prominent with the changing nature of work. Well-being on the other hand, is increasingly being considered in relation to work and the workplace in recent years.",

            "text": "A good starting point in understanding this evolution in focus and thinking is definitions. According to the Oxford dictionary, safety is defined as the condition of being safe; freedom from danger, risk, or injury. Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk. In terms of work, this mainly concerns physical aspects of the work environment. However, the changing nature of work was associated with the emergence of new types of risk relating to psychological and social aspects of the work environment. This brought about greater focus on health at work. A very influential definition that shaped thinking and action in subsequent years was the World Health Organization definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization [WHO], 1948). This definition promoted a more holistic view of health away from a mere focus on physical aspects towards considering social and mental health aspects. Although the WHO definition already referred to a state of well-being, definitions of well-being include additional dimensions to health, such as social, economic, psychological, and spiritual. Well-being refers to a good or satisfactory condition of existence; a state characterized by health, happiness, and prosperity. Obviously achieving this state is not relevant to the workplace or work alone but rather an overall evaluation of one\u2019s life across many areas. As such, actions to improve HSW can be taken within the work context and outside of it. Actions taken in the workplace represent workplace interventions that are implemented in the work setting and consider the characteristics of work environments and workers. On the other hand, actions taken outside the workplace represent public health interventions that are implemented in various settings (for example, in schools, communities or countries) and take into consideration the characteristics of particular populations.",

            "text": "A key question in terms of HSW interventions when it comes to the workplace concerns responsibility. While every individual is responsible for their own actions in various contexts of life, in a specific setting like the work environment, additional responsibility lies with the employer since the work environment will expose workers to particular work characteristics that might in turn pose a certain level of risk to their HSW. While employer responsibility might be formalized under law, this is not the case across countries or in relation to all possible types of risks to workers\u2019 HSW, and in particular new and emerging risks, or risks that are either new or gain in prevalence with the changing nature of work. Accordingly, it is important to consider not only legal duties that employers have towards their workforce but also ethical duties that will extend beyond legal compliance. In addition, while employers bear a legal responsibility towards their workforce, they also bear responsibility towards society. This has meant that enterprises have increasingly been held accountable towards society and that interventions in the workplace, whether legally required or not, are now being increasingly considered in terms of their impact beyond the workforce alone but rather society as a whole (see Chapters 10.1007/978-94-024-1261-1_3, 10.1007/978-94-024-1261-1_4, and 10.1007/978-94-024-1261-1_5). This represents a blurring of boundaries between traditional occupational safety and health and public health initiatives that have also resulted in greater emphasis on the concept of well-being in addition to health and safety.",

It revised the definition at its 12th session in 1995 to read as follows: occupational safety and health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job. Almost 70 years later, the target set through this declaration seems ambitious in many parts of the world, both in developed and developing countries. To understand why, it is worth understanding the context underpinning developments in this area as well as current priorities and needs.",

Liberalization of world trade, rapid technological progress, significant developments in transport and communication, shifting patterns of employment, changes in work organization practices, the different employment patterns of men and women, and the size, structure and life cycles of enterprises and of new technologies can all generate new types and patterns of hazards, exposures and risks. Demographic changes and population movements, and the consequent pressures on the global environment, can also affect safety and health in the world of work. Let us first consider key impacts on the changing nature of the work environment.",

            "text": "Different types of products and services, organizational structures and work processes, and tools and resources are used in the modern workplace. Three main drivers have been proposed in relation to these changes. The first is globalization, a term which refers to the integration of national and regional economies, which became more prevalent since the nineteenth century. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2008), the rapid integration into world markets by six economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa) was an important component of globalization during the past decades. Globalization has led to increased competition across organizations, to a shift in the type of business operations in which companies are engaged, and to extensive outsourcing of activities, primarily to low-wage countries. Flanagan (2006) examined the effects of globalization on working conditions (hours, remuneration and safety) and concluded that globalization has led to greater flexibility of the work process, with more part-time employment, temporary employment and independent contracting of staff (European Agency for Safety & Health at Work [EU-OSHA], 2007; Kawachi, 2008). Houtman and Van den Bossche (2006) confirmed these conclusions on the basis of Eurostat data, reporting that more employees in Europe hold a temporary employment contract and yet more people will work \u2018on call\u2019. OECD reports also confirm these trends. They also highlight that average wage growth has not been equivalent to growth in labour productivity, which is also an outcome of the erosions of the bargaining power of workers in the process of globalization (OECD, 2008).",

Organizational restructuring is accompanied by job insecurity and can result in unemployment with subsequent negative impacts on HSW. However, restructuring should not only be considered a serious threat to individual HSW for those who lose their job (the \u2018direct victims\u2019) but also to their immediate environment (e.g. Kieselbach et al., 2009). In addition, evidence during the past two decades showcases the impact of restructuring on the so-called \u2018survivors\u2019 as concerns health, well-being, productivity, and organizational commitment (Kieselbach et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The third key development relates to technological advancement and the emergence of the internet, which has led to many changes and innovations in work processes. Many forms of manual work have become obsolete and staff must offer different skills and qualifications (Joling & Kraan, 2008). Moreover, \u2018new work\u2019, a term which amongst others refers to telework, i.e. working from home or a location other than the traditional office, is now more widespread. This can result in blurring the borders between working and private life. Work can take place outside the traditional working hours as well as at home or when travelling. Hence, it may impinge on the need for rest and recuperation, or interfere with personal commitments. Also new forms of working methods such as lean production (a production practice according to which the expenditure of resources other than for the creation of value for the end customer is wasteful and should be eliminated, Womack & Jones, 2003), and just-in-time production (a production strategy that strives to improve a business\u2019 return on investment by reducing in-process inventory and associated costs, Womack & Jones, 2003) have been introduced (EU-OSHA, 2007; Kompier, 2006). Overall there has been concern of the effects new forms of work may have on the HSW of workers, organizations and communities (e.g. Benach, Amable, Muntaner, & Benavides, 2002; Benavides, Benach, Diez-Roux, & Roman, 2000; Quinlan, 2004; Quinlan, Mayhew, & Bohle, 2001; Sauter et al., 2002; Virtanen et al., 2005).",

Moreover, in most developing and emerging countries, they also employ more people than large enterprises do. However, occupational safety and health (OSH) is often less well managed in SMEs, creating working conditions that are less safe and posing greater risks to the health of workers than larger enterprises (Croucher, Stumbitz, Quinlan, & Vickers, 2013). In particular, SMEs have less time to devote to providing OSH training and information due to economies of scale, and have less expertise in HSW. Research also confirms a common lack of awareness of the cost implications of occupational accidents and diseases amongst SME owners and managers, as well as a tendency for SMEs to be reactive, rather than adopting proactive and preventive strategies towards OSH (Croucher et al., 2013).",

According to the OECD (2013) most countries will have a retirement age for both men and women of at least 67 years by 2050, and this has already been implemented in many countries. This represents an increase from current levels of around 3.5 years on average for men and 4.5 years on average for women. The same report stresses that high levels of youth unemployment will lead to widespread poverty in old age as young people struggle to save for retirement.",

Most reviews and meta-analyses in the scientific literature make clear that there is no consistent effect of age on work performance (e.g., Benjamin & Wilson, 2005; Griffiths, 1997; Salthouse & Maurer, 1996). Overall, older workers perform as well as younger workers. Furthermore, there are many positive findings with regard to older workers. For example, older workers demonstrate less turnover and more positive work values than younger workers (Warr, 1994). They also exhibit more positive attitudes to safety and fewer occupational injuries (Siu, Phillips, & Leung, 2003) although there is some evidence that it is tenure (time on the job) that should be examined rather than age per se (Breslin & Smith, 2006).",

As discussed, in developed countries there has been a decline in manufacturing and a recent export of some service sector work to developing countries. The way work is designed and organized has changed substantially with a growth in contingent or \u2018precarious\u2019 work and an increase in part-time work, home-based work, telework, multiple job-holding and unpaid overtime. These changes might make it increasingly difficult for older workers to gain or maintain employment, and such employment may entail inferior and unhealthy working conditions. These changes in work design and management have also been accompanied by changes in worker protection; for example, a decline in union density and collective bargaining, some erosion in workers\u2019 compensation and public health infrastructure and cutbacks in both disability and unemployment benefits \u2013 again contexts which are unlikely to favour vulnerable workers, such as older workers. As such older workers may be affected by increased exposure to certain occupational hazards; decreased opportunities to gain new knowledge and develop new skills; less support from supervisors, and discrimination in terms of selection, career development, learning opportunities and redundancy (Chiu, Chan, Snape, & Redman, 2001; Maurer, 2001; Molinie, 2003).",

Gender segregation refers to the pattern in which one gender is under-represented in some jobs and over-represented in others, relative to their percentage share of total employment (Fagan & Burchell, 2002). A growing body of evidence indicates that a high level of gender segregation is a persistent feature of the employment structure globally (e.g. Anker, 1998; Burchell et al., 2007; Rubery, Smith, & Fagan, 1999). Some scholars have argued that estimates suggest that gender segregation in the labour market is so pervasive, that in order to rectify this imbalance approximately 75% of women would have to change jobs or professions (Messing, 1998). Considering differences in employment patterns according to gender (and without taking into account sectors where both genders are represented, e.g. agriculture), women\u2019s jobs typically involve caring, nurturing and service activities for people, whilst men tend to be concentrated in managerial positions and in manual and technical jobs associated with machinery or physical products. Since men and women are differently concentrated in certain occupations and sectors, with different aspects of job content and associated tasks, they are exposed to a different taxonomy of work-related risks (Burchell et al., 2007; EU-OSHA, 2002). For example, women are more frequently exposed to emotionally demanding work, and work in low-status occupations with often restricted autonomy, as compared to men. This differential exposure can result in differential impacts on occupational ill health for men and women (EU-OSHA, 2002; OECD, 2012).",

Even though women are increasingly joining the paid workforce, in most societies they continue to be mainly responsible for domestic, unpaid work such as cooking, cleaning and caring for children, and so they carry a triple burden (e.g. Loewenson, 1999). Women are also largely represented among unpaid contributing family workers, those who work in a business establishment for a relative who lives in the same household as they do (ILO, 2012). Balancing responsibilities for paid and unpaid work often leads to stress, depression and fatigue (Duxbury & Higgins, 2001; Manuh, 1998), and can be particularly problematic when income is low and social services and support are lacking. The lack of availability of child care may also mean that women must take their children to work where they may be exposed to hazardous environments.",

In a pattern intensified by the 2008 financial crisis, structural unemployment has been growing and unemployment varies from 17.3% in the South of the EU and peripheries in 2012, to 7.1% in the north and central countries (EC, 2013). A large proportion of jobs destroyed were in mid-paid manufacturing and construction occupations (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living & Working Conditions [Eurofound], 2013). As a consequence of reduced employment opportunities, poverty has increased in the EU since 2007. Household incomes are declining and 24.2% of the EU population is now at risk of poverty or exclusion. Children are particularly affected as unemployment and jobless households have increased, together with in-work poverty (EC, 2013). This has implications for quality of life and general population health beyond workplace health and safety due to the impact on personal finances.

It is one of the major consequences of today\u2019s turbulent economies and is common across occupations, and both private and public-sector employees (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989; Ferrie et al., 2001; Sverke, Hellgren, & Naswall, 2002).

For example, teleworkers may feel isolated, lacking support and career progression (e.g. Ertel, Pech, & Ullsperger, 2001; Schultz & Edington, 2007). In addition, temporary, part-time and precarious employment can result in higher job demands, job insecurity, lower control and an increased likelihood of labour force exit (Benach et al., 2002; Quinlan, 2004; Quinlan et al., 2001). Workers engaged in insecure and flexible contracts with unpredictable hours and volumes of work are more likely to suffer occupational injuries (ILO, 2013a, 2013b). Although awareness and evidence in developing countries lags far behind those in the industrialized world, evidence has started to accumulate showing similar findings in developing countries (Kortum, Leka, & Cox, 2011).",

Work demands are also commonly cited as reasons for physical inactivity (e.g. Trost, Owen, Bauman, Sallis, & Brown, 2002) as well as an increase in travelling time to work (Houtman et al., 2017). Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks such as coronary heart disease, type II diabetes, and certain types of cancers and psychological disorders (depression and anxiety) (Department of Health, 2004; WHO, 2002; Zhang, Xie, Lee, & Binns, 2004). Another important result of inactivity is obesity which can lead to several adverse health effects, such as back pain, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes (Houtman et al., 2017). In addition, sedentary jobs are associated with an increased prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints or disorders, e.g. neck and shoulder disorders (e.g. Korhonen et al., 2003), and upper and lower back disorders (e.g. Chen, McDonald, & Cherry, 2006). Such disorders may lead to sick leave and work disability (e.g. Steensma, Verbeek, Heymans, & Bongers, 2005). The established health risks associated with sedentary work are premature death in general, type II diabetes and obesity (Van Uffelen et al., 2010).",

Psychosocial risk factors at work have a greater effect on the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints when exposure to physical risk factors at work is high rather than when it is low. In addition, factors such as low job control, high job demands, poor management support or little support from colleagues, as well as restructuring, job redesign, outsourcing and downsizing have been shown to be causally related to increased risks in MSDs (Houtman et al., 2017).",

The widespread use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to work intensification. Developments in technology use in terms of mechanization, automation, and computerization, has led to the substitution of human activities by machines. On the other hand, the use of computers and smart phones with internet access provides easy access to all kinds of information but may also lead to the expectation from colleagues, supervisors and clients that one is always available and can be contacted (e.g. by email). ICT work may then lead to stress symptoms due to excessive working hours, workload and increasing complexity of tasks or isolation in home workers; information overload; pressure of having to constantly upgrade skills; human relationships replaced by virtual contacts; and physical impairments such as repetitive strain injuries and other MSDs due to using inadequate or ergonomically unadapted equipment (Houtman et al., 2017).",

Workers in nanotechnology may be exposed to novel properties of materials and products causing health effects that have not yet been fully explored. The manufacture, use, maintenance and disposal of nanomaterials may have potential adverse effects on internal organs (EU-OSHA, 2013). Although there is a considerable lack of knowledge, there are indications that because of their size, ENMs can enter the body via the digestive system, respiratory system or the skin. Once in the body, ENMs can translocate to organs or tissue distant from the portal of entry. Such translocation is facilitated by the propensity of the nanoparticles to enter cells, to cross membranes and to move along the nerves (Iavicoli & Boccuni, 2010). The ENMs may accumulate in the body, particularly in the lungs, the brain and the liver. The basis for the toxicity appears to be primarily expressed through an ability to cause inflammation and to raise potential for autoimmune deficits, and may induce diseases such as cancer (Houtman et al., 2017).",

Globally, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases at 35% and cancers at 29% were the top illnesses responsible for 2/3 of deaths from work-related diseases, followed by occupational injuries at 15% and infectious diseases at 10%. As a result, approximately 6300 people die every day due to these causes: occupational accidents kill nearly 1000 people every day and work-related diseases provoke the death of approximately 5400 more individuals. There were also over 313 million non-fatal occupational accidents (requiring at least four days of absence from work) in 2010, meaning that occupational accidents provoke injury or ill health for approximately 860,000 people every day (ILO, 2013b).",

Hazardous sectors such as mining, construction, shipping, and in particular fishing continue to take a heavy toll on human lives and health.

The period between the World Wars saw the development of research into personnel selection, training and motivation as prevention measures, often based on theories of accident proneness (see Hale & Glendon, 1987 for a review; Burnham, 2009 for the accident-prone theory). This brought about the second age of safety, which developed separately to technical measures until the period of the 1960s and 1970s, when developments in probabilistic risk analysis and the rise and influence of ergonomics led to a merger of the two approaches in health and safety. There was a move away from an exclusive dominance of the technical view of safety in risk analysis and prevention, and the study of human error and human recovery or prevention came into its own (Hale & Hovden, 1998).",

Further, culture is viewed as a group, not an individual, phenomenon; efforts to change culture, should, in the first instance, focus on changing collective practices (the practices of both managers and workers) and the dominant source of culture is what leaders pay attention to. Much of Hopkins\u2019 work draws on Reason\u2019s (1997) notion that a safe culture is an informed culture and Weick and Sutcliffe\u2019s (2001, 2007) principles of collective mindfulness and high reliability organizations (i.e. organizations that are able to manage and sustain almost error-free performance despite operating in hazardous conditions where the consequences of errors could be catastrophic). Collective mindfulness is based on the premise that variability in human performance enhances safety whilst unvarying performance can undermine safety, particularly in complex socio-technical systems.",

The adaptive age challenges the view of an organizational safety culture and instead recognizes the existence of socially constructed sub-cultures. The adaptive age embraces adaptive cultures and resilience engineering and requires a change in perspective from human variability as a liability and in need of control, to human variability as an asset and important for safety (Borys, Else, & Leggett, 2009). Resilience engineering is similar to collective mindfulness since it also focuses on the importance of performance variability for safety. However, what sets resilience engineering apart from collective mindfulness is the focus on learning from successful performance (Hollnagel, 2006), i.e. why things go right as well as why things go wrong (also called the Safety 2 approach (Hollnagel, 2014).",

Beck argued that environmental risks had become the predominant product of industrial society.

While according to British sociologist Anthony Giddens (1990), a risk society is a society that is increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk. Giddens (1999) defined two types of risks as external risks (for example natural disasters) and manufactured risks (for example, those derived from industrial processes. As manufactured risks are the product of human activity, authors like Giddens and Beck argue that it is possible for societies to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced, in order to mitigate negative outcomes (i.e. responsibility with managing these risks lies with society and more precisely with experts able to do so).

To facilitate management of an evolved health status, it is necessary to develop new health measures that must go beyond detecting pathogenesis and its precursors to measuring those qualities associated with better health (Breslow, 2006).",

According to a salutogenic perspective, each person should engage in health promoting actions to cause health while they secondarily benefit from the prevention of disease and infirmity. Pathogenesis, on the other hand in a complementary fashion primarily focuses on prevention of disease and infirmity, with a secondary benefit of health promotion. Both approaches are needed to facilitate the goal of better health and a safer and more health enhancing environment. Pathogenesis improves health by decreasing disease and infirmity and salutogenesis enhances health by improving physical, mental, and social well-being. Together, these strategies will work to create an environment that nurtures, supports, and facilitates optimal well-being (Becker et al., 2010).",

The biopsychosocial model is a broad view that attributes disease outcome to the intricate, variable interaction of biological factors (genetic, biochemical, etc.), psychological factors (mood, personality, behaviour, etc.), and social factors (cultural, familial, socioeconomic, medical, etc.). It holds to the idea that biological, psychological, and social processes are integrally and interactively involved in physical health and illness. It was pioneering in advocating the premise that people\u2019s psychological experiences and social behaviours are reciprocally related to biological processes. As a result, interventions should address all these dimensions and not narrowly focus on limited perspectives (such as only the biological perspective for example).",

Indeed, the traditional medical model of ill health was increasingly recognized as having achieved limited success in tackling occupational health conditions such as stress, anxiety, depression and MSDs (White, 2005). These challenges which have been shown to now have an increasing prevalence in the workplace (as discussed earlier), do not have a clear underlying physical basis nor do they demonstrate a linear relationship between injury, pain and disability. Instead, they appear to be strongly mediated by psychological and social factors. Accordingly, Waddell (2004) categorized such conditions as \u2018common health problems\u2019. The challenges presented by common health problems contrasts with the past success of occupational medicine in dealing with conditions that have an identifiable cause and a clear relationship between dose and response (Waddell & Burton, 2006).",

Contemporary models focus on the interaction between the environment and the individual and emphasize either explicitly or implicitly the role of psychological processes, such as perception, cognition, and emotion (psychological models). These appear to determine how the individual recognizes, experiences, and responds to stressful situations, how they attempt to cope with that experience and how it might affect their physical, psychological, and social health (Cox & Griffiths, 2010).",

However, while we are a long way from the challenge of work-related stress being tackled effectively, there has started to be a shift towards promoting well-being at work and not only preventing stress and its associated negative outcomes in terms of both health and safety. This shift has followed trends in public health (discussed earlier) and also psychology towards more positive concepts. The positive psychology movement, championed by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000), is an attempt to shift the emphasis in psychology away from a preoccupation with the pathological, adverse and abnormal aspects of human behaviour and experience. The positive psychology literature offers a number of perspectives that help with understanding how well-being can arise in work situations (Lunt et al., 2007). For example, the concept of flow was introduced by Csikszentmihalyi (1990) which can be defined as a subjective condition where an individual is fully absorbed in, and engaged with, the task he or she is carrying out, promoting an experience of competence and fulfillment.",

As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, well-being refers to a good or satisfactory condition of existence; a state characterized by health, happiness, and prosperity. In particular, three key concepts have been discussed as relevant to well-being: happiness, quality of life and resilience (Lunt et al., 2007). Layard (2005) defined happiness as feeling good; its inverse is feeling bad and wishing for a different experience. Factors that affect our levels of happiness include among others family relationships, our financial situation, work, community and friends, our health, personal freedom and personal values. Quality of life overlaps with contemporary interpretations of happiness. Quality of life is a subjective state that encompasses physical, psychological, and social functioning. A defining feature of quality of life is its basis on the perceived gap between actual and desired living standards. Resilience of individuals has been described as partly a context dependent characteristic, in that what enables resilience in one environment may be less adaptive in another (Lunt et al., 2007). Increasingly it is recognized that resilience is important at different organizational levels (teams, organizations) and that these different levels are to some degree interacting (e.g. Schelvis, Zwetsloot, Bos, & Wiezer, 2014).",

Continuing to work in silos and adopting mono-disciplinary perspectives will not allow us to move forward in this complex landscape.
