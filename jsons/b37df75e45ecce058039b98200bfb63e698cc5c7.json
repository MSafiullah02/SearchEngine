Three situations can be considered: -The foreign body is clinically very strongly suspected (parents have witnessed the aspiration of a foreign body, there is a clear aspiration syndrome, persistent cough, dyspnea): the indication for tracheobronchial endoscopy should be maintained without prior CT-scan. -Doubt is cast on foreign body aspiration (aspiration syndrome without subsequent clinical anomaly, or conversely clinical compatible (cough, choking, dyspnea, asymmetric auscultatory abnormalities), but without frank aspiration syndrome or any other obvious aetiology): chest reinforces suspicion (visualisation of the foreign body; unilateral expiratory trapping; systematized ventilation anomalies); the radiologist may then also check the CT-scan for pneumological signs in favour of a Covid-19. -In a case with very little suspicion (no frank aspiration syndrome, no suggestive clinical anomalies), no CT-scan nor tracheobronchial endoscopy is recommended. \u2022 Other indications for airway or oesophagus endoscopy should be maintained: -Button battery ingestion (oesophagus, nasal cavity) -Caustic ingestion -Repeated extubation failure, after discussion with neonatologists or intensive care anaesthetist \u2022 Tracheostomy Very few indications should be maintained, and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis due to a high risk of dissemination of viral particles during the procedure and also subsequently during tracheostomy tube changes \u2022 ENT oncological surgery Few indications exist (see up-to-date dedicated recommendations \"Canc\u00e9rologie ORL et Covid-19: Etat des lieux\" on the SFORL website https://www.sforl.org/actualites-covid-19/). \u2022 Mastoiditis, complicated sinusitis, cervical or peripharyngeal abscess Exclusive medical treatment based on intravenous antibiotic therapy guided by bacteriological samples should be preferred.
