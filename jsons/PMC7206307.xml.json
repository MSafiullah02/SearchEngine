A range of attention mechanisms are introduced to address this issue, such as target-to-sentence attention [2], fine-grained word-level attention [3], and multiple attentions [4]. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models are also recently used for this task because of the capability to extract the informative n-grams features [5]. All the aforementioned methods focus on exploiting labeled data to build the classification model, whose performance is often largely limited. This is because they normally require large-scale high-quality labeled data to be well trained, but in practice we have only small target-level labeled data since it is very difficult and costly to collect due to the complex nature of the task, e.g., fine granularity, co-existence of multiple targets in a sentence, and context-sensitive sentiment. Two main methods to address this issue include: (i) generating and incorporating extra sentiment-informative representations by using auxiliary knowledge resources, e.g., sentiment lexicons [17, 28]; and (ii) pretraining the embeddings of words or the parameters of networks using large-scale unlabeled data [3, 16]. However, both methods can\u2019t capture context-dependent sentiment. For example, the opinion \u201clong\u201d can have completely opposite sentiment in different contexts, e.g., it is positive in \u201c battery life is\nlong\u201d but negative in \u201cthe start-up time is too\nlong\u201d. Additionally, the sentiment lexicons require very expensive human involvement to handle data with evolving and highly diversified linguistics, so the pretraining method is more plausible.",

            "text": "The pretraining aims at generating generic representations for different learning tasks, which can often extract some transferable features for a particular task. However, due to the generic learning objective, it can also extract a large number of features that are irrelevant or even noisy w.r.t. a given task such as sentiment classification, leading ineffective use of the unlabeled data. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to associate the feature learning on unlabeled data with the downstream sentiment classification to extract highly relevant features w.r.t. sentiment classification. Specifically, besides pretraining on unlabeled data, we take a step further to learn and extract highly sentiment-discriminative neural units from a pretrained model, e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM)-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [11]. The selective sentiment-aware units, termed Neural Sentiment Units (NeSUs), can generate highly relevant sentiment-aware representations, which are then leveraged by LSTM networks to perform sentiment classification on small labeled data. This enables LSTM networks to achieve significantly improved data efficiency and to learn context-dependent sentiment representations, resulting in substantially improved LSTM networks. In summary, this paper makes the following two main contributions:We discover for the first time that feature learning on unlabeled data can be associated with downstream sentiment classification to learn some highly sentiment-discriminative neural units (NeSUs). These NeSUs can be leveraged by LSTM-based classifiers to generate sentiment-aware and context-dependent representations, carrying substantially more task-dependent information than the generic representations obtained by pretraining.We further propose a novel LSTM-based target-level sentiment classifier called NeaNet that effectively incorporates the most discriminative NeSU to exemplify the applications of the NeSUs. Extensive empirical results on two benchmark datasets show that NeaNet (i) substantially outperforms 13 (semi-) supervised state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers and (ii) achieves significantly better data efficiency.\n",

            "text": "Deep Methods. Recursive neural network is one popular network architecture explored at the early stage [29], which heavily relies on the effectiveness of syntactic parsing tree. Recurrent neural networks have also shown expressive performance in this task. TD-LSTM [9] incorporated target information into LSTM and modeled preceding and following contexts of the target to boost the performance. Target-sensitive memory networks (TMNs) [21] were proposed to capture the sentiment interaction between targets and contexts to address the context-dependent sentiment problem. However, these models fail to identify the contribution of each word to the targets. The attention mechanism [2, 4, 10, 22] is then applied to address this issue. For example, A target-to-sentence attention mechanism, ATAE-LSTM [2], was introduced to explore the connection between the target and its context; IARM [22] leveraged recurrent memory networks with multiple attentions to generate target-aware sentence representations. As CNN can capture the informative n-grams features, convolutional memory networks were explored in [18] to incorporate an attention mechanism to sequentially compute the weights of multiple memory units corresponding to multi-words. Instead of attention networks, [5] proposed a component to generate target-specific representations for words, and employed a CNN layer as the feature extractor relying on a mechanism of preserving the original contextual information. Some other works [20] exploited human reading cognitive process for this task. These neural network-based methods stand for the current state-of-the-art techniques, but their performance are generally limited by the amount of high-quality labeled data.",

Many semi-supervised methods have been explored on sentence-level sentiment classification, such as pretraining with Restricted Boltzmann Machine or autoencoder [23, 26], auxiliary task learning [24] and adversarial training [25, 27]. However, there are only few studies [16, 19] on semi-supervised target-level sentiment classification. [19] explored both pretraining and multi-task learning for transferring knowledge from document-level data, which is much less expensive to obtain.  [16] used a Transformer-based VAE for pretraining, which modeled the latent distributions via variational inference. However, it failed to distinguish the relevant and irrelevant features with respect to the sentiment.",

On both datasets, our model NeaNet consistently achieves the best performance in both accuracy (ACC) and macro-F1 compared to all 13 supervised and semi-supervised methods. E.g., compared to RAM, MGAN, TNet and ASVAET, which are the best competing methods in the overall ACC, NeaNet substantially outperforms them by 1.18%\u20133.05% in Laptop and 2.64%\u20134.61% in Rest. The superiority of NeaNet is mainly due to the incorporation of the NeSU-driven SUCR and SUSP components that effectively leverage the discriminability of the NeSU to capture context-dependent sentiment information, which enables the LSTM networks to classify the sentiment of opinion targets more correctly. Particularly, as PRET+MULT is pretrained on document-level labeled sentiment data, its pretraining may introduce ambiguity for fine-grained sentiment task, leading to significantly less effective performance than NeaNet. ASVAET is also pretrained on unlabeled data, and generates generic representations only, which are much less expressive than the NeSU-enabled sentiment-aware representations.",
