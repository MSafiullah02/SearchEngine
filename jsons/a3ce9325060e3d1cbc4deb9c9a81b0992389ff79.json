A comprehensive understanding of the direct physiologic effects of social stress on viral pathophysiology is needed. To determine the effect of social stress on HIV pathogenesis during acute viral infection without sociobehavioral confounders inherent in human cohorts, we compared commonly 25 measured parameters of HIV progression between singly and socially housed SIVinfected pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Singly housed macaques demonstrated lower CD4/CD8 ratios, greater CD4 T cell declines and greater T cell activation compared to socially housed macaques during acute SIV infection. Singly housed macaques furthermore had higher viral loads in the plasma and cerebrospinal 30 fluid throughout acute infection. These data demonstrate that social stress directly impacts the pathogenesis of acute lentiviral infection and imply that social stress has a direct effect on the pathogenesis of HIV and potentially other viral infections.",

While data is currently unavailable for analysis in the COVID- 19 pandemic, other viral pandemics, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), may 45 provide insight. HIV infection remains widespread and, while people with HIV (PWH) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) today live relatively normal lives compared to untreated individuals, outcomes for PWH vary greatly and depend upon a number of factors, including social stress. PWH are at higher risk for social stress due to stigma associated with infection and marginalization of people from demographics that are 50 considered at higher risk of infection (5) . Not surprisingly, PWH report decreased physical and mental well-being compared to the general population (6) , and worse mental and physical quality of life than individuals with other chronic illnesses (7).",

The CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio was examined first, as a lower ratio is associated with negative outcomes in PWH (10) . CD4/CD8 ratio was 18% lower in singly housed animals at day 14 following inoculation compared to socially housed 85 animals (p=0.04), though ratios decreased as expected for both singly and socially housed following infection (Fig.1A, p=0 .0004). Difference in CD4/CD8 between the groups was partly driven by a 38.5% greater decline in CD4 T cell number in singly housed compared to socially housed animals ( Fig.1B; p=0 .0001), in conjunction with a 34.1% greater decline in CD8 T cells ( Fig.1C; p=0 .0002) and a 44.4% greater decline in 90 lymphocytes ( Fig.1D; p<0 .0001). These differential declines originated pre-inoculation, during which CD4 T cell numbers were 27.8% higher (Fig.1B, p=0 .007), CD8 T cells were 25.9% higher (Fig.1C, p=0 .0006) and lymphocytes were 28% higher (Fig.1D, p=0.0004) in singly housed compared to socially housed animals. Greater recovery in CD8 T cell ( Fig.1C ; p=0.0003) and lymphocyte number ( Fig.1D ; p=0.01) at day 14 in 95 singly housed compared to socially housed macaques additionally contributed to lower CD4/CD8 in singly housed animals.",

This effect is observed while all aspects of infection and care remained consistent between these groups (Table S1) This analysis has implications beyond primary infection for PWH. The CD4/CD8 140 ratio was lower and CD4 decline greater in singly housed compared to socially housed animals. Lower CD4/CD8 ratio is a predictor of non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality (10) and age-associated disease in PWH (12), while low CD4 counts are a direct prognostic indicator of disease progression throughout infection (13) . Our observation of these negative prognostic indicators in the context of social stress provides additional 145 evidence that social stress directly contributes to negative outcomes. Additionally, latent reservoirs are established during acute infection, remain the major barrier to cure, and are especially difficult to eliminate from sanctuary sites such as the brain (14, 15) . Our findings of higher viral loads in the plasma and CSF in the context of social stress have long-term implications for PWH. These higher viral loads may ultimately originate from 150 the increased CD4 activation that we observed in the singly housed animals, as activated CD4 T cells simultaneously serve as permissive cells for the virus to infect and produce more virus if infected, thus potentiating viral spread and reservoir seeding (16).",

Social isolation is associated with under-expression of proinflammatory genes, including those involved in innate antiviral resistance through type I interferon responses (25, 31) , and could directly affect immune response and viral control. Compounding these effects, PWH 165 have increased levels of plasma cortisol compared to uninfected controls, and inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) and HIV gp120 are implicated in mediating this increased level of cortisol by increasing levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone.",

However, the findings from studies on the effect of social support on 175 PWH have been equivocal, and any impact of social stress on disease progression and health outcomes in PWH is compounded by the fact that social isolation is more prevalent in PWH compared to uninfected controls (23) .

Our data complements the existing 210 literature by demonstrating differences in the immune response and viral loads in singly compared to socially housed SIV-infected macaques. Though we cannot directly demonstrate improvements in translation and reproducibility through this work, the magnitude of the decline in CD4 T cell counts that we observed in socially housed macaques during acute infection (two-fold) is more analogous to that seen in humans 215 during primary HIV infection (38) than the three-fold change observed in singly housed macaques. Further, the decrease in variability of the data generated by our socially housed macaques has implications for study reproducibility. Social housing of macaques is therefore an important refinement that may improve the translational value and reproducibility of data obtained from working with macaque models of HIV infection, 220 and caution must be taken when comparing the data from studies completed in singly and socially housed macaques.",

Further research is needed into the implications of social isolation 230 on the pathogenesis of other viral infections. In particular, the findings of our study have high relevance for the potential impact of social isolation practices widely advocated during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The present study aims to demonstrate the direct effect of social stress on HIV pathogenesis by comparing how single versus social housing affects the progression of acute SIV infection in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). We hypothesized acute SIV infection would have greater impact on macaques housed individually prior to and following viral inoculation compared to macaques housed in pairs or trios. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective analysis of acute infection data from the pigtailed macaque model of HIV infection dual-inoculated with SIV/17E-Fr and SIV/DeltaB670 (9), and compared macaques housed singly with those housed socially with a compatible 70 conspecific. We demonstrated that housing macaques individually directly affects CD4/CD8 ratios, CD4 T cell decline, T cell activation and SIV viral load during acute infection. Social stress thus directly influences disease progression in the SIV-infected macaque model of HIV and social stress is likely to have direct pathophysiologic impact on health outcomes of PWH and potentially on the pathogenesis of other viral 75 infections.",
