Their subtle ability to develop strategies to evade the host immune system, along with the high mutation and replication rates, has made viruses plague terrestrial ecosystems since their appearance. Indeed, virus-borne infectious diseases tend to spread abruptly over wide geographical areas, leading to outbreaks that can dramatically affect health, national economies, and the overall well-being of societies.1 In the past few decades, pharmaceutical and biotechnological advance has succeeded in developing new therapeutics for the management of different viral diseases: for example, anti-retroviral therapy against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or the pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral drugs used for hepatitis C (HCV) management. Nevertheless, the majority of current therapies are unable to accomplish virus eradication or sustained virological response, therefore the battle against viral pathogens still represents a primary focus of medical research. In addition, the constant onset of new viral pathogens, generally correlated with massive outbreaks, imperils researchers to determine the pathogenic mechanisms of the new viruses, with the ultimate goal to provide new therapeutic approaches in the antiviral field.2, 3\n",

Indeed, in the past few years, research on the biological role of G4s in virology has boomed, providing strong evidence of the relationship between G4s and the regulation of key viral steps. A recent comprehensive bioinformatics analysis traced putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in all human viruses, showing that their distribution is statistically relevant, making them a distinctive feature of the different virus families. In addition, such PQSs are highly conserved, despite the high recombination rates that characterize viruses, suggesting a crucial role for G4s in viral evolution and replication, and corroborating their targeting as a valid pharmacological approach for antiviral therapy.6\n",

It has the largest dsDNA genome among HHVs (~ 235 kb), which was found to include a remarkably high number of PQS, distributed among the promoters of immediate-early, early and late genes. The majority of the sequences have been demonstrated to actually fold into G4 structures, and to be stabilized after treatment with two different porphyrin-based G4 ligands, TMPyP4 and NMM. Interestingly, in a luciferase reporter system that included different PQSs in viral promoters, NMM was shown to suppress the expression of several mRNAs and to reduce both intracellular and extracellular viral DNA levels.20 Recently, the anti-CMV activity of a polymerase inhibitor CX-5461, a known G4 ligand currently in phase I clinical trial, was also demonstrated. Interestingly, the compound induced a 2.0 log reduction in viral titer, together with a significant decrease in the amount of viral DNA and pUL44, the viral processivity factor: these data indicate that the effect of CX-5461 is exerted at the viral DNA replication stage of the viral life cycle. Considering that the compound is known to induce a DNA damage response (DDR), its antiviral activity may be related to a double G4-related mechanism of action, involving both the viral targets and the activation of cellular stress response pathways.21\n",

Considering that telomeres are commonly known to fold into G4s, involvement of these non-canonical arrangements in the regulation of HHV-6 chromosomal integration is plausible. Indeed, treatment of HHV-6 infected telomerase-expressing cells with the G4 ligand BRACO-19 resulted in a significant reduction in chromosomal integration, likely due to the prevention of telomere end elongation.22\n",

            "text": "EBV is one the most common human viruses in the world, affecting more than 90% of the world's population. Its primary infection tends to be generally asymptomatic. However it could lead to infectious mononucleosis and, in the worst case, to various types of cancer. Its genome comprises genes encoding for six EBV nuclear proteins that are expressed only in the latent infection and sustain the viral episome maintenance.23 Studies on the characterization and role of G4s in EBV showed that the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1), the viral protein pivotal to immune evasion, promotes viral DNA replication by interacting with RNA G4s and recruiting the cellular origin replication complex. The EBNA1 mRNA itself is enriched in folded G4s, which behave as cis-acting modulators of viral mRNA translation, producing ribosome dissociation.24, 25 EBNA1 mRNA G4s have also been found to regulate the endogenous presentation of EBNA1-specific CD8 + T-cell epitopes, seen in persistent infections.26 The employment of G4 ligands has helped the investigation of the functional and biochemical characteristics of EBNA1. BRACO-19, for instance, stabilized the viral RNA G4 and, in infected lymphocytes, reduced EBV genome copy numbers. It also negatively modulated transcription levels of EBNA2 and EBNA3A, and inhibited EBNA1-dependent DNA replication.24 Another G4 ligand, pyridostatin (PDS), enhanced the stability of the EBV G4s, reducing EBNA1 synthesis level in a concentration-dependent way, both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, EBV-infected cells were found to be less efficiently recognized by virus-specific T cells, although such a mechanism still needs to be elucidated. These data show that G4-mediated inhibition affects processes that are crucial for viral DNA replication,25 reinforcing the importance of alternative DNA structures in the regulation of virus processes. The cellular protein nucleolin, which has been widely shown to bind G4s,27 recognizes and also binds viral EBNA1 mRNA G4s. As a consequence it downregulates EBNA1 expression and antigen presentation, counteracting EBV stealthiness. Such interactions can be targeted to modulate EBV progression: indeed the PhenDC3 G4 ligand was found to prevent nucleolin binding to EBNA1 mRNA G4s and to increase the endogenous EBNA1 levels in EBV-infected B cells and in cells derived from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.28 Following on from PhenDC3, variously substituted bis(acylhydrazones) derivatives have also been investigated for their ability to interfere with the nucleolin/EBNA1 mRNA G4s interaction. Two compounds, PhenDH2 and PyDH2, have been found to be more active and less toxic with respect to the lead compound.29 However, it is worth noting that although many of the tested PhenDC3 analogues displayed strong in vitro binding and stabilization of RNA G4s, only a few of them were able to interfere with EBV immune evasion. This result suggested that the ability to hamper nucleolin/EBNA1 interaction might require additional activities, independent from G4 stabilization. Indeed, different G4 ligands can generate opposite effects: this is the case of PDS, which, in contrast to PhenDC3, further suppressed EBNA1 mRNA translation,25 as also demonstrated by quantitative proximity ligation assay.30 All these data support the ability of EBNA1 G4s to operate as nucleolin-binding platform. A very recent study reported that they also promote nuclear retention,31 but the relationship between the two processes needs further investigation. Notably, EBV nuclear antigens are involved in B-cells transformation, especially EBNA1, which is expressed in all EBV-related tumors.32 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the nucleolin/EBNA1 G4 complex could be involved in virus-related oncogenesis and it might be exploited as a pharmacological target to impair both virus and tumor progression.",

At the moment, there are no treatments for the lytic or latent infections.33 The KSHV genome is arranged in a ~ 140 kb long central region, encoding viral genes, flanked by repeated regions (terminal repeats, or TRs), which harbor the viral episome unique origin of replication. TRs are highly enriched in G/C bases and have been demonstrated to form stable G4s, located both in the forward and reverse strands, and involved in the regulation of episomal replication. Stabilization of viral G4s by means of different G4 ligands, PhenDC3 and TMPyP4, stalled the replication fork at the TR level, with consequent replicative stress and inhibition of KSHV DNA replication, which resulted in the dramatic reduction (60%) of viral episome copy numbers.34 In addition, the KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1) protein, which is the master regulatory protein of KSHV latency, forms G4 structures in its own mRNA, analogous to EBNA1. G4 stabilization induced by TMPyP4 treatment downregulated LANA1 translation, with consequent reduction of protein expression in KSHV infected cells, suggesting that LANA1 mRNA G4s are involved in the regulation of the translation machinery. Interestingly, reduced translation has been found to be strictly related to reduction of antigen presentation, one of the main mechanisms adopted by LANA1 to promote immune evasion.35\n",

The one located in the core gene was characterized as the most stable G4.48 Its stabilization with the G4 ligands TMPyP4 and a PDS derivative (PDP) promoted viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase stalling, with consequent reduction in HCV core protein levels. In vivo analysis revealed that PDP led to G4-mediated antiviral activity in the low micromolar range, by inhibiting intracellular replication of different HCV genotypes.49 A deeper investigation also showed that the HCV core RNA G4 is recognized and bound by the cellular protein nucleolin. This interaction, which has been found to be structure-related, resulted in inhibition of HCV replication in cells. Such activity was counteracted by the employment of G4 ligands such as PDS and PDP, which competed for the same binding site. TMPyP4 did not produce the same effect, however, this last compound is in general less selective for G4s.50 Moreover, HCV infection promoted nucleolin overexpression, which in turn induced a drastic reduction of HCV total RNA levels. Conversely, nucleolin silencing was directly correlated with increased HCV RNA expression.48 These results strongly suggest the existence of a host anti-viral immunity mechanism involving G4 structures. Additional bioinformatic studies based on a different algorithm showed the presence of a very interesting G4-forming sequence in the stem-loop IIy of the HCV negative strand, precisely in the 3\u2019-UTR, which is the initiation site for the (+)-strand replication. The G4 sequence, highly conserved in many different HCV strains, was strongly stabilized by the bisquinolinium derivative PhenDC3 and as a consequence, RNA synthesis was hampered by more than 70%. Moreover, in a luciferase system in which luciferase expression was directly related to viral replication, 60% reduction was observed upon treatment with the compound.51\n",

NCp7 is known to preferentially bind single-stranded nucleic acids compared to duplex states, and works as a chaperone, as it promotes folding of nucleic acids in their most thermodynamically stable conformations.67 It was recently demonstrated that NCp7 contributes to RT processivity by recognition and subsequent unfolding of HIV-1 RNA G4s.68 NCp7 has also been reported to interact in vitro with a G4 sequence located in the HIV-1 central DNA flap overlapping positive-strand, which forms a tetramolecular G4.69 The G4s in this region might be involved in the protection of the pre-integrated genome from nuclease degradation.

            "text": "Regarding the provirus, the LTR U3 promoter sequence is highly enriched in guanines, especially at the Sp1 and NF-\u03baB binding sites.70 In this region, three overlapping G4 structures can form: LTR-II and LTR-III that are constitutively formed, and LTR-IV, the folding of which is induced by proteins or ligands binding.71 LTR-III and LTR-IV structures, which have been characterized through NMR spectroscopy, showed very peculiar features. LTR-III G4 folds into a hybrid, three-layered quadruplex, with a conserved duplex stem-loop in the central loop.72 LTR-IV G4 has a parallel topology with a bulged G-tract at its 3\u2032-end.73 Such distinctive structures could be exploited to design specific ligands able to selectively target HIV-1 LTR G4s, overcoming the low selectivity that characterizes currently available G4 ligands. The two LTR G4s are mutually exclusive and induce opposite effects on the LTR promoter activity. LTR-III G4 stabilization inhibits viral transcription,71 while LTR-IV G4 hampers this activity.73 The folding/unfolding of this region is controlled by at least two cellular proteins: nucleolin, which greatly stabilizes the LTR G4s, with a consequent overall silencing effect,74 and the human ribonucleoprotein A2B1, which in turn unwinds the G4s to promote transcription.75 These data infer that the fine balance between G4s might be one of the regulatory mechanisms in the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity. Moreover, it has been very recently shown that the LTR transcription machinery also involves another alternative structure, the i-motif,76 which can form in the provirus negative strand, further supporting the regulatory role of non-canonical nucleic acids structures in virus biology.77 Several G4 ligands have been tested to assess the effect on HIV-1 G4s on the viral promoter and promising stabilizing activity was observed, leading to an overall antiviral effect. BRACO-19 significantly stabilized the naturally occurring G4s, LTR-II and LTR-III, and induced folding of LTR-IV. Upon treatment with increasing compound concentrations, LTR promoter activity was reduced by almost 70% when compared to the untreated condition: a mutated non-G4 sequence used as control showed no variation in promoter response and thus confirmed the effect to be G4-related.71 BRACO-19 was then tested in various cell lines, using different HIV-1 strains. It exerted promising G4-mediated antiviral activity, in the micromolar range. Considering that the G4 ligand also stabilizes HIV-1 RNA G4s, the antiviral effect could be ascribed to a dual mechanism of action, both at the pre- and the post-integration level.66 The development of a new series of core-extended NDI derivatives has significantly improved the anti-HIV-1 activity of the G4 ligands. In fact, these molecules, characterized by exceptional solubility properties, displayed outstanding in vitro stabilizing activity on HIV-1 LTR G4s, with preference for the viral over the human telomeric G4s, used as a cellular reference. Most importantly, the series exhibited strong antiviral activity in the low nanomolar range (IC50\n < 25 nM). Time-related antiviral assays combined with reporter assays, have confirmed the G4-mediated mechanism of action.78\n",

The observed PQSs were highly conserved and able to fold into two-tetrads G4s. Nef G4s were stabilized in vitro by different G4 ligands, such as TMPyP4, BRACO-19 and PIPER.

The virus establishes a state of latent infection in T cells: at this stage, it is not susceptible to antiretroviral drugs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are complex and not completely understood; nonetheless some forms of latency entail transcriptional interference, thus the 5\u2032-LTR and its G4s might be involved.80 G4 stabilizing agents have been tested in cells infected with latent HIV-1, where they showed strong antiviral activity, effectively linking G4s to HIV-1 latency. BRACO-19 in latently infected cells reduced viral titer to undetectable levels, an effect that was still observed after long-term treatment. TMPyP4 administration also blocked viral replication in two lymphocyte T cell lines with established HIV-1 latency. The antiviral activity was found to be coupled with higher apoptosis/death rates, with respect to untreated cells and the effect was enhanced upon association with DNA damage repair inhibitors.81\n",

Altogether, the data collected in the past few years on G4s in viruses, their interaction with specific ligands and the consequent effect on the modulation of the viral machinery validate the possibility of developing G4-based antiviral drugs. The first aspect to acknowledge is that all the characterized viral G4s are located in highly-conserved genomic regions. In virology, base-conservation analysis is a critical issue, since viruses are characterized by high mutation rates.82 The limited availability of deposited sequences for many viruses, especially the emerging ones, limits a comprehensive conservation analysis; however, data accumulated so far clearly show that PQSs are conserved elements within viruses, thus representing efficient targets in antiviral research.",

As a matter of fact, one of the major limitations in the development of these compounds is in respect to the common chemical features that characterize the currently employed G4 ligands: the large flat aromatic core that stacks on the G quartet, increasing discrimination among different G4s; high-molecular weights and positive-charged side chains, which guarantee loops and grooves interaction to the detriment of cellular uptake.83 Indeed, low selectivity and poor drug-like properties are major factors in the lack of progression of current G4 ligands beyond phase II clinical trials.",

In fact, loop and groove regions are distinctive marks of the G4 structure and are amenable to selective recognition. Structural data on cellular G4/G4 ligand complexes has demonstrated the involvement of the grooves in the stabilization of such interactions, contributing to formation of a compact arrangement that would likely efficiently impair the transcription machinery.84 It is therefore possible to speculate that enhanced selectivity could be mediated by interaction with loop/groove moieties. To this end, NMR and crystallographic determinations of viral G4s and their complexes with ligands are necessary, in order to allow ad hoc design of new antiviral molecules. To date, only two viral G4 structures have been solved through NMR spectroscopy: the HIV-1 LTR-III72 and LTR-IV73 G4s. Molecular docking analysis, coupled to cleavage experiments, has enabled the identification of groove interactions between LTR-III G4 and the NDI-Cu-DETA derivative, a highly selective G4-cleaving agent.85 Structure resolution is thus a valid approach for the development of specific compounds.",

One possible explanation for this outcome is the amount of viral G4s, which, during infection, largely exceeds that of cellular G4s, especially during replication, as reported for HSV-1.16 Considering that generally G4s are located in regulatory regions crucial for viral life cycle progression, a combination of abundance of viral G4s and impairment of key viral functions might explain the observed antiviral effect. Exploring the effective folding of G4s during different steps could help not only help understand the role of G4s in different viruses, but it would heighten the possibility of targeting them in the most useful and effective way. Ultimately, extending this kind of investigation to other viruses would likely lead to a more rapid and successful application of G4 ligands in antiviral research.",

Current available therapies cannot eradicate the latent virus from its host, and consequently infective agents such as HIV and HHVs still cause non-eradicable diseases. In this scenario, a G4-mediated pharmacological approach would affect both the replicating and the latent virus, possibly leading to virus eradication. To this end, the virus-induced manipulation of host chromatin needs to be considered. Recently, several studies reported virus-host chromatin interactions and chromatin machinery modulation by viral proteins.86 Epigenetic modifications of viral chromatin and viral transcriptome might be crucial in conveying the virus toward either lytic or latent infection.87, 88 Since G4 formation has been directly linked to the suppressive role of heterochromatin and it seems to occur only in highly transcribed nucleosome-depleted chromatin regions,89 it would be fascinating to understand how viral G4s affect and could be affected by such a complex mechanism.",
