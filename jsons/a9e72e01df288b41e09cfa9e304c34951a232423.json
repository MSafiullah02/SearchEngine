Aim of this survey was to assess in depth the impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers (HCW). A 40-item online survey was disseminated via social media inviting Italian HCW, with questions exploring demographics, health status and work environment of respondents. A total of 527 were invited to take part in March 2020, of whom 74% (n = 388) responded to the survey. Of these, 235 (61%) were women. HCW were mostly physicians (74%), from high-prevalence regions (52%). 25% experienced typical symptoms during the last 14 days prior to survey completion, with only 45% of them being tested for COVID-19. Among the tested population, 18 (18%) resulted positive for COVID-19, with 33% being asymptomatic. Only 22% of HCW considered personal protective equipment adequate for quality and quantity. Females and respondents working in high-risk sectors were more likely to rate psychological support as useful (OR, 1.78 [CI 95% 1.14-2.78] P = 0.012, and 2.02 [1.12-3.65] P = 0.020, respectively) and workload as increased (mean increase, 0.38 [0.06-0.69] P = 0.018; and 0.54 [0.16-0.92] P = 0.005, respectively). The insights from this survey may help authorities in countries where COVID-19 epidemic has not yet broken out. Management strategies should be promptly undertaken in order to enhance safety and optimise resource allocation.",

It has been shown that Italy has a higher proportion of older patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection than China and that the older population may partly explain differences in case-fatality rates between the two countries [2] . Other reasons may lay in different screening policies, hospital overcrowding, limited bed capacity in intensive care units compared to other European countries, relative delay from the first case detection on 21 February to the first containment decree from the government that closed the relevant villages, and stochastic factors determining high-prevalence foci in relatively small geographic areas [3] .",

Since the early 1990s, a strong decentralization policy has been adopted, leading to the devolution of power to a lower governance level that is currently exercised in 21 regional health systems. Starting from 2015, all regions have been affected by the cutback initiative imposing to implement a gradual, phased reduction of the regional costs of personnel to be achieved before the end of 2020, even for the regional systems that manage to achieve a non-negative economic result [4] . Such a centrally-imposed manoeuvre has crystallized gaps in service provision and health system performance between regions. As a consequence, activation of different local protocols for the management of COVID-19 emergency (e.g. screening policy, indication to hospital admission, resource optimization) may have potentially contributed to the heterogeneity of observed outcomes even between neighbouring regions.",

If testing positive, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and any medical therapy was explored. All respondents were asked whether they were quarantined or received influenza vaccine in 2019-20; whether they believed to have been the source of infection for patients, colleagues at work or family members. Quantity and quality of PPE at workplace was further explored as was how the number of intensive care unit beds changed from before the COVID-19 emergency till the outbreak; and if increased, whether implementation of dedicated staffing was also obtained. The activation of local protocols for management of COVID-19 patients was investigated and respondents asked whether they personally contributed to its development and/or complied with its requirements. Fatality related to COVID-19 was explored in terms of causality (i.e. exclusively resulting from respiratory failure or rather consequent to suboptimal bed capacity or non-compliance to protocols). Psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCW was also assessed in terms of psychological safety, experience of deaths among acquaintances, availability of psychological support at the workplace, and degree of workload. Finally, respondents were asked whether they could keep up with the medical literature on COVID-19.",
