However, it is becoming increasingly clear in mouse models that long-lived memory T cells are also present in nonlymphoid tissues (1\u00b18). Several studies have indicated that non-lymphoid memory cells exhibit an activated phenotype (1\u00b13), leading to the proposition that these cells represent an in situ rapid response force. Consistent with these ideas, two subsets of human memory T cells have recently been described, central and effector-memory cells, that differ in the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the lymphoid homing marker L-selectin (CD62L) (8) . Whereas central memory cells (CCR7 high /CD62L high ) represent classical lymphoid memory cells, effector-memory cells (CCR7 low / CD62L low ) circulate outside the lymphoid organs and were found to maintain various effector functions (8) . It should be noted though that phenotypic classi\u00aecation of CD8 T cells during chronic human infection may be more complex: memory CD8 T cells appear to accumulate at different points along the differentiation pathway in different infections (9) . At least three different phenotypes can be distinguished based on CD27 and CD28 expression (9) . From these studies it was concluded that human memory CD8 T cells would be better de\u00aened on the basis of their activation status (9) .

However, it should be noted that the number of CD8 + IFN-g + events was very small and that the brains had not been perfused.

As can be deduced from Fig. 2 , the prM-E speci\u00aec T cells (i.e. IFN-g + cells) in the spleen and in the CNS were all 1B11 high at day 14 post-immunization, indicating that these cells are effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Clearly, two 1B11 high CD8 T cell populations can be distinguished, and, as shown in Fig. 4 , these populations appear to differ in the expression level of CD69, and, therefore, possibly in their activation status. Re\u00afecting the differentiation pattern of the IFN-g + prM-E-speci\u00aec CD8 T cells, CD43 expression levels were decreasing in the entire population of CNSresident CD8 T cells at day 56 post-infection, although 1B11 high CD8 T cells were still present. Thus, CNS-resident CD8 T cells were heterogeneous in their 1B11 expression patterns. On the other hand, the expression patterns of several activation and homing markers (CD69, Ly6A/E and CD62L) suggested an activated phenotype. A large majority of CD8 T cells in the CNS had down-regulated L-selectin (CD62L low ), both at day 5 (85%) and day 56 (89%) post-infection (Fig. 3B) , consistent with their non-lymphoid localization.

CD69 and Ly-6A/E were also up-regulated in day 5 effector cells (Fig. 3C and D) , although expression levels at day 5 were more heterogeneous than at day 56. The differences between the CD8 T cell populations at days 5 and 56 are most clearly illustrated by double-staining for CD69 and 1B11/CD43: at day 56, more cells have up-regulated CD69 expression and down-regulated CD43/1B11 expression (Fig. 4) .

(ii) The remaining CD8 T cells could recognize other dengue virus epitopes, outside the prM-E proteins. It is possible that other epitopes, cross-reactive in the YFV vaccine and the dengue challenge virus (e.g. from the conserved NS5 polymerase protein), are responsible for the expansion of T cells. (iii) There may be a population of prM-E-speci\u00aec CD8 T cells that failed to produce IFN-g upon antigenic stimulation. Inactivated CD8 T cells have been detected previously in the context of antiviral responses (27\u00b129). The second question is perhaps the most important issue raised by our experiments and by several earlier studies (1,10,11): why are virus-speci\u00aec CD8 T cells retained in the brain and what keeps them in a partially activated state? There has been some debate on the role of persisting antigen in retaining T cells in the brain. Hawke et al. observed persisting antiviral CD8 T cells in the absence of antigen after challenge of immunized mice with in\u00afuenza virus (1). However, as proposed by these authors (1) and given the extreme sensitivity of CD8 T cells (30) , it is possible that CD8 T cells are retained by persisting MHC class I\u00b1peptide complexes on neuronal cells that are below the threshold of detection. Marten et al., in contrast, reported that retention of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the brains of MHV-infected mice strictly coincided with the presence of viral RNA (11) . These authors have provided two explanations for the observed differences (11) . (i) T cells recruited during secondary in\u00afuenza virus infection are memory cells, whereas primary cells are induced during MHV infection. (ii) In\u00afuenza virus infects neurons, which express low levels of MHC class I molecules (31, 32) , whereas MHV predominantly infects microglia and astrocytes, which express higher levels of both MHC class I and class II molecules (11) . Clearly, our dengue virus infection model is more similar to secondary in\u00afuenza virus infection: the intracranial dengue virus infection recruits memory T cells (induced by s.c. vaccination) and dengue virus has a neuronal tropism in mice (33) . These differences should also be interpreted in the light of the complex phenotypic differences seen in human chronic infections (9): MHV does establish a persistent infection in mice (10, 11) , whereas in\u00afuenza virus evidently does not (1) . It is unclear whether dengue virus persists after the acute encephalitis and this will be a subject for further investigation. Importantly, however, the CD4 T cell response in the brain (the CD8 \u00b1 IFN-g + cells in Fig. 1 ) (14) strongly decreased from day 5 to 56. This decreasing CD4 T cell response is inconsistent with persistence of antigen, as shown by Marten et al. (11) in the case of persisting T cell responses against MHV. Thus, in the absence of antigen, CD4 T cells ef\u00afux from the CNS (11, 34) , whereas CD8 T cells can persist (1) . A third issue that needs further investigation is the homing potential of the CNS-resident CD8 T cells [reviewed in (35) ]. It is currently unclear whether these cells express homing markers speci\u00aec for the brain or a set of markers that merely speci\u00aees non-lymphoid localization, irrespective of the tissue. One intriguing possibility is that CD69 plays a role in the retention of T cells in tissues. Recent results using CD69 transgenic mice indicate that thymocytes that constitutively express CD69 are retained in the thymus (26) . This may implicate CD69 in the regulation of T cell traf\u00aecking, as suggested by the authors (26) . In addition, CD43 (i.e. the high mol. wt form detected by the 1B11 antibody) may play a role in CNS localization: antigen-speci\u00aec CD8 T cells do not migrate into the brains of CD43 knockout mice that are intracerebrally infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (20) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1397, "end": 1401, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1723, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1804, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2036, "text": "(31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2040, "text": "32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2178, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2424, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2615, "text": "(10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2619, "text": "11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2667, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2897, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3028, "end": 3046, "text": "Marten et al.
