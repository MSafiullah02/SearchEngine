The common types of isolation precautions, based on known or suspected modes of transmission, are contact, droplet, and airborne isolation. Airborne isolation, in contrast to droplet isolation, is intended to break the chain of transmission of pathogens carried in aerosol particles less than 5 \u03bc in size [1] . The term respiratory isolation is confusing as it may be used to mean droplet or airborne isolation, and we recommend against the use of this term. The pathogens transmitted via airborne route are tuberculosis (TB), varicella, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola, and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9 [2] . Airborne isolation is also employed for novel and emerging pathogens whose transmission is unknown. In contrast, droplet isolation is used for pathogens/diseases such as diphtheria, epiglottitis, or meningitis for the first 24 h of treatment, and pertussis and influenza [1] .",

Therefore, physical space and engineering controls such as proper ventilation; air handling including air exchanges and air flow management, i.e., negative pressure air flow; and high-efficiency particulate filtration are the cornerstone for preventing airborne transmission. Measures such as ultraviolet lights are also effective when used as an adjunct. Portable HEPA filters can also be used in certain situations. When combined with appropriate use of respiratory protection, airborne transmission can be prevented effectively. Physical space controls gained particular importance in recent years as research into transmission of emerging pathogens such as coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) and influenza viruses (e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza) identified potential for airborne transmission. A complete discussion of physical space and engineering controls is beyond the scope of this chapter.",

This has been observed in Canada during the SARS epidemic (42% of cases were in HCW and resulted from transmission from patients), in New York during the surge of HIV-related TB transmission, and MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula, all of which led to a significant infection rate of healthcare workers [2, 3] .",

It is also called the N95 mask or dust mask. It is useful to know that particulate respirators are classified as not resistant to oil, N; resistant to oil, R; or oil proof, P. Depending on percent filter efficiency of the air particles they filter, they are designated as 95, 99, or 100, thus resulting in nine classes of non-powered air-purifying particulate filters. An air-purifying respirator can have an air-purifying filter, cartridge, or canister, and it can have a quarter mask facepiece, half mask facepiece, or a full mask facepiece. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) use a blower to force ambient air through air-purifying elements and then through tubing into a hood or helmet. Parts of a PAPR are a half or full facepiece, hood, or helmet, a breathing tube, a canister or cartridge with filter, and a blower. They may be able to provide additional protection compared to the usual N95 respirators if P100 filters are used, because they filter 99.7% of particles 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter and provide full face and neck protection including eyes and ears. Others such as supplied air respirators (as in airlines) or the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) such as those used by divers are rarely necessary for a hospital respiratory protection program or pandemic preparedness. The reader is encouraged to look up resources from CDC, NIOSH, and OSHA [4] [5] [6] for a more detailed description of the different types of respirators. The respirator classes are given an assigned protection factor value which is applicable when the respirators are properly selected and used in compliance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), with properly selected filters or canisters, as needed. A higher APF value is expected to provide greater respiratory protection to employees. For example, a common N95 respirator has an APF of 5, a full facepiece PAPR has an APF of 1,000, and a full facepiece SCBA has an APF of 10,000 [6] .",

PAPRs used by first receivers need to be the most protective type of PAPR equipped with a filter and chemical cartridge. Surgical respirators (without exhalation valves) should be selected for use in environments where a sterile field is needed.

Patients can see the wearer's face, and they are easier for communication than an N95 respirator. Reusable respiratory protection equipment has advantages when dealing with pandemic events of potential airborne transmission (such as pandemic influenza or spread of coronavirus such as MERS). In the setting of a pandemic, it is likely that a very large volume of disposable N95 masks would be required to provide protection to every healthcare worker (including not only physicians and nurses but also any other individual, paid or not, who may share air space with individuals with potentially infections transmitted through the airborne route). In these situations, reusable equipment may be more advantageous. They have the disadvantages of being heavy to wear, interfering with stethoscope use, being noisy and sometimes making communication difficult, needing batteries or electricity, and potential for contamination with infectious material, thereby requiring decontamination and reprocessing between uses [8] . There are also theoretical concerns about how PAPRs may affect the wearer's performance. Some of this data comes from nonmedical use of respirators. Visual acuity may decrease, up to 75% in some reports, and visual range may be diminished. More concerning is the potential impact on steadiness and even cognitive impairment (although most studies have failed to prove this) during use due to thermal burden (when temperature rises over 85 \u00b0F, there is decreased reaction time, and this correlates with unsafe work behaviors) especially in hot environments [9] [10] [11] [12] . A study performed by AlGhamri et al. [13] found no cognitive impairment in individuals using N95 or PAPRs while performing predetermined tasks but found a negative effect in cognitive function when using negative pressure, full-face respirators. This study was limited by a small sample size and the lack of experience with respirator use by many of the studied subjects. A previous study showed that the use of a PAPR was associated with a potential decline in speech intelligibility, but this did not reach statistical significance when compared to other respiratory protection equipment or no respiratory protection at all. Even though full-face PAPRs do not require fit testing, they need to be properly size fitted. PAPRs are not exempt from limitations in their capacity to protect individuals when they are not properly size fitted. Gao et al. evaluated the level of protection provided by a PAPR in manikins, using different sizes of full-face masks. They found decreased protection when the manikins were not fitted with a properly sized full-face mask [12] .",

They compared the cost of stockpiling N95 masks, PAPRs, and reusable elastomeric half-face respirator. They took into account the storage space required, the half-life of the equipment, and the maintenance required, in the setting of a massive event requiring about six million contacts per one million population during the pandemic event. They based their model on assumptions derived from the 1918 influenza pandemic event. They found that the cost of stockpiling PAPRs is likely to be higher than the stockpiling of N95 masks, given the need not only of storage but also maintenance and battery care. Most batteries lose charging capacity over time and need to be replaced. Disposable batteries usually have a longer half-life, but only 10 h of battery life, and are more expensive. These batteries are usually made for the equipment, and regular batteries are not usually utilized. PAPRs need a larger storing area, need to be cleaned between uses, and the batteries expire, requiring battery recharging stations within reasonable access from the patient care areas. They are also more expensive, with each PAPR causing upwards of $1000.",

The OSHA recommends a hierarchy of controls -prevention or substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and work practices, and, lastly, respiratory protection/personal protective equipment. One of the OSHA requirements is that the employer makes available respiratory protection gear in any workplace where respiratory protection may be required. This includes the presence of a program to select the type of respirators, ensure its proper maintenance, employee fitting if tight-fitting respirators are used, use during potential emergencies, cleaning/storage/maintenance of the respiratory protection equipment, training of employees on respirator use, risks of exposures, and evaluation of effectiveness of the program. It is required that respirators are fitted. The standard requires employees to be fit tested prior to the initial use of a respirator, annually, and whenever a different respirator facepiece (size, style, model, or make) is used. Furthermore, personal protective equipment must be provided at no cost to the employee.",

While OSHA stipulates federal standards that are followed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and most organizations, the Joint Commission requires that each healthcare facility clearly outlines elements of their respiratory protection program in their policies and procedures and demonstrates compliance [15] . Furthermore, there is considerable variation among states and organizations, especially those which are public, county-owned, or state-owned teaching institutions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthcare facilities follow their respective federal, state, or local regulations as it is not a regulatory agency [17] . It is important to know these nuances. Studies show that hospitals are experiencing challenges with the implementation of their respiratory protection programs. Twenty-four states have state-approved OSHA plans. These state-level plans incorporate regulations that are at least as strict as those set forth by OSHA at the federal level. In August 2009, during the peak of H1N1 pandemic, California enacted the nation's first occupational standard for aerosol transmissible diseases [18] . The standard requires, among other things, that hospitals care for patients with pandemic influenza using respiratory protection that includes an N95 respirator at a minimum. In addition to variation in state-level plans, recent studies in Minnesota, Illinois, and New York have demonstrated a wide variation in interpretation and implementation at the hospital level [19, 20] .",

The APF for loose-fitting PAPRs is 25 and for full facepiece tight-fitting PAPRs is 1000, which is more than the APF for a typical N95 respirator mask which is 10. In a workshop conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 2015 [8] , the participating experts noted that PAPR use is increasing in facilities across the nation. In a study (REACH II Public Health Practice Study -Respirator Evaluation in Acute Care Hospitals 2010-2012) that evaluated hospitals' respiratory protection programs and respirator usage in six states across the USA, CA, MI, MN, IL, NY, NC, more than 85% of the participating hospital managers and unit managers said their facilities had PAPRs available for use, while 30% of the healthcare personnel themselves were not aware of how to access a PAPR in their facility [8] . More than 40% of the healthcare personnel did not know what would happen if someone failed a fit test. A major finding of the study was that healthcare personnel were largely unaware of appropriate use of respiratory PPE and that the employer focus was on fit testing rather than training on proper use. PAPRs do not require fit testing, allow the patients to see their full face, and they accommodate facial hair. The disadvantage is they do not allow the use of a stethoscope. That being said, each PAPR costs about $1800, and there are costs associated with cleaning and disinfection between use and annual maintenance. Many experts are not convinced that there is a scientific basis for respirator fit testing annually as OSHA stipulates.",
