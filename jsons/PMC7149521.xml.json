Food safety is crucial at every step right from its production to its preservation, transportation, and consumption. Consumers expect optimal quality, good stability, and a safe food product at a reasonable price. Monetary and legal aspects related to food products as a consequence of food contamination are of grievous concern to food producers accompanied with loss of consumer confidence (Odumeru, 2002). With these concerns, food safety and nutritional quality have always been a priority issue for producers, food safety regulators, the food industry, and consumers (Karlsson, 2004). Foodborne illness could also be as serious as botulism, listeriosis, or hemolytic uremia syndrome, which often need hospitalization. Hence, an accurate and quick monitoring of food quality should be feasible during various stages of food production until consumption.",

Moreover, many analytical techniques are destructive and affect the seal of the packaged food (Duncan, 2011). Until recently, most of the biosensors developed were marketed for medical applications. Moreover, food matrices offer many limitations due to their opacity, coloring matter, light scattering and complexity of food materials.

The receptor of a biosensor recognizes and interacts with the analyte. Receptors could be enzymes, antigens (Ag), nucleic acids, or organelles performing an affinity, biochemical, or catalytic reaction. Binding or catalysis between receptors and substrate transforms the physical, chemical, or biologic information to some form of energy, such as, electrochemical, optic, fluorescence, mass, or calorimetric signals, which is measured by the transducer. The transducer thus provides quantifiable physicochemical signals proportional to the analyte concentration (Thakur and Ragavan, 2013).",

Nanosensors are relatively a new concept in the food industry compared to their application in pharmaceuticals. Nanocomposites are utilized in several ways to improve the efficiency of nanosensors. They essentially consist of nanoparticles (NPs) attached to any of the various recognition labels followed by detection through any of the sensing approaches illustrated in Fig. 15.2\n. Nanotechnology in sensing, permits miniaturization of sensors which facilitates their integration with normal food production and packaging machinery and equipment, or can be used offline as point-of-care devices (Leonard et al., 2003). The demand for analyte samples and reagents used in nanosensors is less than that of conventional methods of detection.

The small size of nanomaterials (1\u2013100 nm) results in large surface areas with high surface reactivity, high electric conductivity, enhanced magnetic properties and improved quantum confinement effects, such as, luminescence and catalytic properties, making them very sensitive (Kaittanis et al., 2010) with high analyte-capturing efficiencies (Duncan, 2011). The slightest modification of the nanostructures with respect to their size, self-assembly, surface composition, and shape alters and tunes their electronic, conductive, fluorescence, light-scattering, binding properties and the absorption-emission spectra. They can also permit engineering with different molecules and combinations of individual bioaffinity agents and act as transducers to enable ultrasensitive detection, as well as, multiplex sensing assays for different pathogens and protein-based toxins (Tallury et al., 2010, Xu and Ying, 2011). For instance, in one study, combinations of metallic platinum nanocomposites and single-walled carbon nanotubes coated on glassy carbon provided enhanced sensitivity for detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose over individual nanocomposites by voltammetry within 3 s. The presence of nanocomposites ensured that the electric contact of the glass electrode and the biosensor loaded with glucose oxidase enzyme was more sensitive than that of an unmodified glass electrode loaded with the same enzyme (Hrapovic et al., 2004).",

For instance, quantum dots (QDs) permit labeling and visualization, replacing classical fluorophores. Metallic NPs are conducting in nature and thus wiring of the biologic unit facilitates a rapid transfer of electrons. Hence, electrodes are often modified with a monolayer of AuNPs conjugated to bioelements. In one study, glucose oxidase conjugated to silver/gold/platinum NPs electrodeposited on metal electrodes enhanced transfer of electrons between enzyme and electrode with improved stability (Zhu et al., 2007). The role of conducting polymer nanowires and semiconductors as nanomaterials in sensor applications has already been reviewed (Willner et al., 2007).",

They are multifunctional wherein sampling, separation, reaction, and detection can be performed on the same device. Nanocantilever-based sensors have been used to detect various molecular interactions, such as, Ag\u2013Ab, enzyme\u2013substrate\u2013cofactor, chemical interactions, receptor\u2013ligand and nucleic-acid hybridization (Hall, 2002; Kumar, 2007). Bio-Finger is a portable nanosensor consisting of nanocantilevers made of piezoresistive material for detection of pathogens, chemicals, and toxins in food based on ligand\u2013receptor interactions. Any binding or interaction between an Ag and Ab induces mechanical stress on the nanocantilever, which is coated with antibodies, and changes the electric resistance of the material. Multiple such nanocantilevers can be arranged in an array to form a single chip. The total analytical time for detecting the analyte is 15\u201320 min. The cost of Bio-Finger is expected to be $10, cheaper than the existing diagnostic techniques. Arrays have an upper hand in obtaining sensitive and simultaneous detection of analytes. Reference sensors can also be incorporated into the array, minimizing the noise.",

Change in relaxation times (\u0394T\n2) can be detected by benchtop-magnetic relaxometer (20 MHz, 0.47 T ) or superconducting-quantum interference device (SQUID) or by magnetic resonance imaging (60 MHz, 1.5 T ) (Zheng et al., 2009b). The higher the relaxivity of iron-oxide NPs, the higher is the sensitivity of detection. Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis (MAP) was quantified in whole milk using spherical iron-oxide NPs and dextran-coated iron oxide nanorods (R\n2 300 M/m per s) within 5\u201330 min without any interference (Kaittanis et al., 2007, Nath et al., 2008). In the presence of MAP, conjugation of iron-oxide NPs changed the spin\u2013spin \u0394T\n2 of water protons. Low bacterial concentration caused assembly of NPs on bacterial surfaces, and hence high \u0394T\n2 was observed. While at high bacterial concentrations, \u0394T\n2 decreased due to the dispersed state of the NPs. In the presence of a magnetic field, NPs acquire magnetization. On switching off of the magnetic field, free NPs relax rapidly by Brownian rotation and thus do not contribute to any signals. Abs bound to pathogens are immobilized and undergo Neel relaxation; that is, the oscillations vary in the presence of a target with slow decay of magnetic flux, dissipating magnetic flux detectable by SQUID, as opposed to, the change in Brownian motion observed in free NPs (Chemla et al., 2000). Magnetic NPs conjugated to Ab and immobilized with SQUID on amylar film detected L. monocytogenes above a count of 6 \u00d7 106 (Grossman et al., 2004). However, the requirement of high infrastructural costs limits the application of these magnetic NP-based sensors for the food industry.",

The method could detect almost 10 bacteria present in 10 \u03bcL of sample within 15 min. The magnetic NPs form clusters upon identification of the analyte and the self-assembled cluster complexes decrease the nuclear spin of surrounding water protons (T\n2). Detection of T\n2 was possible by a handheld portable device consisting of a microcoil array for nuclear magnetic-resonance measurements, a microfluidic network for handling sample and mixing with NPs, and a permanent magnet to generate a polarizing magnetic field (Lee et al., 2008). The combination of gold-microelectrode array in a microfluidic device along with magnetic NPs conjugated with Ab helps in detection of pathogens, for example, E. coli in ground beef. The bacterial cells were concentrated by immunocapture by a factor of 104\u2013105 in a volume of 400 pL; and the metabolism was detected by impedance. Detection time was comparatively reduced with bacilli in a dilute sample (Gomez-Sjoberg et al., 2005). E. coli could be detected with nanocantilever coated with agarose-nutritive media for bacilli. As the mass of the cantilever array increased, the resonance frequency changed. The cantilever could detect a mass of approximately 100 active E. coli cells within 1 h (Fig. 15.3b). Selectivity of the method could be improved by adding antibiotics to the nutritive media (Gfeller et al., 2005). Likewise, magnetic NPs conjugated to anti-H5N1 Ab aggregated in the presence of avian flu virus. High transition-temperature superconducting quantum interference senses the immunomagnetic reduction of the reagents and allows quantitation of H5N1 in wash-free samples (Yang et al., 2008). Diagnostic kits containing AuNPs have been studied for detecting influenza virus in poultry. These diagnostic kits have AuNPs conjugated with specific protein of the avian influenza virus (Emami et al., 2012). Literature has ample such examples for detection of pathogens (Table 15.1\n).",

Concentrations of benzoic acid up to 0.03 \u03bcM could be proportionally detected by catalytic inhibition of tyrosinase entrapped in titania gel modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and Nafion in nonalcoholic beverages. The results obtained were consistent with those obtained with HPLC method but with a better sensitivity of 1.06 \u03bcA/\u03bcM (Kochana et al., 2012).

High consumption causes buildup of the neurotransmitter and interferes with muscular responses and acts as a neurotoxin (Mulchandani et al., 2001). Conventionally, they are detected by chromatography, which is time-consuming and needs trained personnel for extensive preparation steps with no real-time detection. Organophosphorous pesticides can be selectively determined by Ab immobilized on magnetic NPs coated with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane based on enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay with high sensitivity (Hu et al., 2010). Acetyl cholinesterase immobilized on copolymer of polypyrrole and polyaniline followed by doping with multiwalled carbon nanotubes could detect thiocholine up to 1.0 ng/mL with good reproducibility. Polypyrrole is used as a polymer matrix as it can be easily electropolymerized in neutral pH solutions at lower oxidation potentials conducive for biologic molecules, while carbon nanotubes provide effective wiring and an anionic dopant. Copolymer of polypyrrole with aniline provided a porous matrix for entrapment of acetyl cholinesterase (Du et al., 2010b). A disposable screen-printed electrode consisting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes with Drosophila melanogaster acetyl cholinesterase and Prussian blue detected dichlorvos and carbofuran (organophosphate and carbamate pesticides) up to 0.5 \u03bcg/L in vegetable and water samples (Tang et al., 2011).",

Chitosan permitted formation of bioadhesive films for immobilization of xanthine oxidase. The sensor displayed a detection level of 0.1 mM without any interference from matrices (Devi et al., 2012).

Photoactivated indicator ink, consisting of TiO2- or SnO2 NPs and redox-active methylene blue dye, detects even trace quantities of oxygen retained during packaging or during leak cases (Mills and Hazafy, 2008). Electrospun nanofibers and nanowebs made of carbon, metal-oxide semiconductors, polymers (nylon-6, polyacrylic acid, and polyvinyl alcohol), and ceramics have been employed as sensors for detection of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, moisture, formaldehyde, and other volatile organic gases (Ding et al., 2010). Adsorption of gases changes the oxidation\u2013reduction potential of oxide semiconductors and affects the electric conductance (Shevade et al., 2003). Polyacrylic-acid nanofibers coated with QCM (Quartz crystal microbalance) exhibit a sensitivity of 130 ppb for the detection of ammonia (Ding et al., 2005). Perylene-based nanofibrils containing fluorophores detect parts-per-trillion level of gaseous amines (Che and Zang, 2009). A tenside (detergent) film dispersed with carbon-coated CuNPs is also sensitive to humidity. Moisture causes the polymer to swell, resulting in separation of NPs, and hence absorption and reflection of different colors. On dissipation of moisture, the sensors are reusable (Luechinger et al., 2007). Some more examples are given in Table 15.5\n.",

Chemical selectivity and sensitivity of sensors depend on metal and peripheral constituents of the complex (Brunink et al., 1996). Microfabricated beams of silicon (cantilevers) coated with polymer are also nanomechanical sensors for detecting volatile gases. Interaction of volatile gases results in swelling of the polymer, and the surface stresses cause bending of the cantilever or change in resonating frequency for cantilevers in static or dynamic mode (Gouma and Sberveglieri, 2004). Nano-ZnO film gas sensors evaluated quality of Chinese vinegar. ZnO NPs are sensitive to hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, ozone, and alcohols at room temperature. This is a unique feature compared to headspace gas chromatography, which requires heating to achieve equilibration of volatile gas in the headspace (Zhang et al., 2006). Few nanosensors can detect gases released from food products that are not suitable for consumption due to spoilage (Vald\u00e9s et al., 2009; Ghasemi-Varnamkhasti et al., 2011; \u015aliwi\u0144ska et al., 2014).",

Considering regulatory aspects related to food products of genetically modified (GM) organism origin, a thorough assessment is thus required for risks related to consumption of these products. Sociopsychological aspects affect the acceptability of GM foods. Protein analysis by using immunosensors accounts for one of the growing markets in the food industry. SDI Europe Ltd. has developed an immunoassay that can detect GM food ingredients using dipstick devices. Detection of GM food products that are consumed by either humans or animals are based on PCR techniques that analyze specific DNA sequences. These developments have led to miniaturization of the instruments that were previously used in laboratories and are now available for on-site analysis of samples using DNA chips. These tests can also be modified into DNA biosensor devices (Tothill, 2001).

Several antimicrobial packaging and oxygen-scavenging food packages have been developed (Saxl, 2011). Imperm (Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN, USA), Aegis, Durethan, and others use a nanocomposite of nylon and nanoclay with enhanced barrier properties that can help keep the oxygen out and the carbonation in, especially in polyethylene bottles. Beer in nanocomposite bottles can keep for as long as 30 weeks. The same has also been used in soda, milk, and water bottles, as well as, in military food packages (Gru\u00e8re, 2012).

Purposes of packaging are to retard food deterioration, increase in shelf life and provide protection from environmental influences, such as, light and moisture. There are materials that change color on exposure to visible- or UV light, indicating the quality of the food product. This technology when coupled with information and communication technology can automatically send data to users or monitoring sections about the condition of food products. This combination can revolutionize the world of the packaging industry both at the consumer level and at the industry level. For example, substances that are produced due to food spoilage processes (lactic and acetic acids, alcohols, and amines) can be detected by the use of smart-packaging materials made of luminescent nanosized ZnO and organic luminophores. These nanophotonics assemblies can work as novel packaging materials. The principle involved behind this novel packaging is that it detects the change in properties (optic, electric, or mechanical) of sensors. These changes can be analyzed by visual inspection or by external devices that convert the packaging response into electric signals followed by data interpretation using computer systems. This combination of smart packaging with communication technology is cost-effective and utilizes photonics principles at the nanoscale level. This innovative technique of detection is termed nanophotonics with detection limits of 2 \u00d7 10\u20133 M/L for ZnO and 10\u20135 M/L for organic luminophore (Sarapulova et al., 2015).",

Commercial biosensors based on nanocomposites are concise, simple, and easy to use for point-of-care biosensing. There are diagnostic assays that are fabricated using nanosensors for point-of-care assessment of Ab in milk samples, but they are not commercially available for field testing. Research is ongoing to make them available for testing on farm animals using nonserological milk samples (Vyas et al., 2015). Cellulosic nanowhisker production technology has been developed to replace the use of plastic and fiberglass, by making biocomposite from wheat straw. Nanobarcode technology has gained momentum in the past few years because of its ability to form a large number of combinations. But this technology is not yet well exploited (Dasgupta et al., 2015). Inorganic materials like SiO2, MgO, and TiO2 are being used as coating materials for used as oxygen barriers, and Ag for \u201cactive coating\u201d for antibacterial activity (Chaudhry and Castle, 2011).",

Its wider application in the food industry extends from food production to food processing and ultimately to food consumption. Tracing food products, quality assessment, safety, and maintaining a nutritional index have all made the food industry take a deeper look into technology involved in innovative diagnostics and biosensing techniques. On-site and point-of-care detection for a large number of increasing analytes requires quick, sensitive, and accurate measurements. This has inspired many researchers in the food industry to develop nanotechnology-based sensors as diagnostic tools. Nanotechnology-based biosensors using nanocomposites will reduce the load of laboratory testing and provide on-site applications. There is an urgent need for more available technology in the food industry for easy, affordable, sensitive, and broad-spectrum analysis of food products, both at industrial level and at consumer level. This chapter has specifically emphasized developments in the field of nanotechnology-based biosensors being incorporated in food industry for detection of plant-based pathogens, toxins, GM food products, nutritional index, and regulatory aspects attached to them.",
