Most patients only have mild symptoms, but mainly elderly and persons with comorbidities can develop severe acute respiratory disease (China CDC, 2020) . Hospitals have been confronted with a fast growing number of patients, often exceeding the intensive care (IC) capacity. Many countries have implemented control measures that include a combination of increased hygiene, travel restrictions, case finding, contact tracing and physical distancing measures. The specific physical distancing measures differ between countries and between regions; their overall aim is to reduce the number of contacts in the population thus preventing the transmission of infection. The impact of these measures on the reduction of contacts in the population, and the reduction of contacts made by different groups within that population, are poorly quantified.",

Mobile telephone data provided by telecom companies are used to measure the change in mobility patterns (Oliver et al., 2020; Pepe et al., 2020) . Similarly, the location history of smart phones can be tracked with apps (Google 2020). The anonymized and aggregated mobility patterns can suggest changes in contact patterns in the population at large. To obtain direct and detailed information on contacts, cross-sectional studies are conducted in which participants report their age and gender as well as the age and gender of all persons they have contacted during a single day (Mossong et al., 2008; Hoang et al., 2019) . Contact surveys have been successfully used to quantify the reduction in the number of contacts associated with physical distancing measures in Shanghai and Wuhan, China, estimated at 88% and 86%, respectively (Zhang et al., 2020) , and in the UK (Jarvis et al., 2020) among the adult population, at 74%. One of the challenges with the contact survey approach is to obtain a reliable baseline measurement before physical distancing measures were implemented. In the Wuhan study participants needed to recall the number of contacts during a regular weekday at the end of 2019. In the UK study the baseline was provided by a similar study conducted 13 years ago among a different representative UK study population (Mossong et al., 2008) .",

The contact matrices for household members illustrate how participants live with persons in their own age category and with their children or parents (i.e., 30 years younger and older); this is apparent in both baseline and the physical distancing surveys. The matrices for contacts in the community indicate fewer contacts within the younger age groups in the physical distancing survey compared with the baseline survey. In the physical distancing survey, persons of 80 years and older had a relatively large number of community contacts with age groups from 50 to 79 years old. In this survey, 85% of the contacts with persons of 80 years and older were reported by health care workers. Taken together, the household and community contact patterns reveal that age-specific mixing does not change much between the baseline and the physical distancing surveys (disassortativeness index is 0.53 for the baseline and 0.54 for physical distancing survey). However, the effective number of contacts per person (i.e. the largest eigenvalue of the contact matrix) decreased from 16 (14 -21, 95% credible interval) in the baseline survey to 6.1 (5.4 -7.7) in the physical distancing survey, an average reduction of 62% (48 -72).",

First, the definition of contact (having a conversation in person or physical contact) is a good proxy measure for at-risk contact events where SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. Second, all age groups are equally susceptible and infectious. As evidence accrues that children are less infectious or less susceptible (Zhang et al., 2020; Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) , and children report a larger reduction in contacts compared with other age-groups after imposition of physical distancing, a reduction in the effective number of contacts represents an upper bound for the reduction of the reproduction number. This, in turn, implies that the physical distancing measures that reduce the effective number of contacts by 62%, are sufficient to reduce a reproduction number with values up to 2.6, to 1 or lower, and halt the COVID-19 epidemic.",

For instance, 90% of participants in the physical distancing survey were indigenous Dutch, compared to 78% in the baseline survey (Verberk et al., 2019) . Apart from the potential for selection bias, there are differences in participant characteristics between the baseline study in 2016/2017 and the physical distancing survey in 2020, and these differences may have affected the results.

This means that the contact reduction may have been underestimated. Second, the physical distancing survey participants reported a larger household size on average, which results in a greaterer number of household contacts. Third, the physical distancing participants reported their contacts more often on weekdays (85% versus 64% in the baseline survey), which would result in an underestimation of the reduction in the number of contacts. Fourth, the physical distancing survey was carried out in two months in spring, whereas the baseline survey was conducted over a period of almost two years. Because contact patterns change little throughout the course of a year (B\u00e9raud et al, 2015) , we do not expect this to substantially affect the estimated reduction. Fifth, the additional question in the physical distancing survey questionnaire that asked beforehand whether the participants had had any contacts allowed us to check the reliability of their reported number of contacts. The reported number of contacts in the baseline survey, without such a check, may have been larger. All these differences together may have led to a slight underestimation in the reduction in the number of contacts.",

To compare this with our results, we calculate the total number of contacts including community and household contacts for the participants in our surveys who are 18 years and older, and find a reduction of 56%. At the time of the studies the control measures in the UK and the Netherlands rank at similar values of the stringency index (Hale et al., 2020) . The effect on contact reduction differs, possibly due to study population differences or compliance.",

The estimated contact reduction is applicable to other countries and regions with similar control measures. The estimated age-specific contact matrices are useful for conducting scenario analyses with age-structured transmission models of COVID-19, to project the future course of the epidemic under physical distancing measures, and to explore the possible effects of lifting them Salje et al., 2020) . As we plan to repeat the contact survey at regular intervals, we will be able to monitor the number of contacts made over time, and detect the impact of future changes in these measures such as the reopening of schools, as well as changes in compliance with the measures that remain. We believe that contact surveys such as these can help to inform and guide infection control measures in this time of unprecedented physical distancing, and in the next phase of the epidemic, when the most drastic control measures might be lifted.",
