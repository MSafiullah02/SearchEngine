Despite extensive measures that were developed and implemented to reduce outbreaks of pandemics and epidemics, global surveillance and monitoring systems have witnessed a rise in the number of such events [1,3,4]. In recent years, the international community, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been called upon to manage numerous infectious disease outbreaks: the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the most recent 2016 Zika outbreak [1,3]. Due to the substantial impacts on social, economic, and even political systems, outbreaks of infectious diseases pose a great concern to national governments, as well as the international community [5].",

The IHR aims to protect the world population by encouraging all countries to create and maintain core capacities of detection, assessment, reporting, and management of public health risks, as well as timely sharing of information concerning events that may impact the public health in many countries. [7,8] Policymakers and healthcare leaders are urged to ensure appropriate allocation of resources to enable the management of public health risks by building capacities to detect events that may constitute a threat to public health, determine if these may impact the international community and enact an appropriate response to contain the event [2,4,7]. Yet, recent publications have indicated that less than one third of the global community fully complies with the IHR, emphasizing the crucial need to design mechanisms that can be appropriately and practically implemented by all nations [4]. Health policy makers, navigating complex systems and pressed to make difficult decision within scarce resources setting, need to prioritize resource allocation, implement decision-making mechanisms, and instate governance in building and sustaining preparedness and response measures [11]. There is a need to advance evidence-based insights, a, rational framework and a methodology that can facilitate the process.",

Elements that function effectively in normal times will be more functional and efficient during emergencies.3\nGovernance: The local networks require a framework that will allow and facilitate information-sharing and communication between themselves and with higher levels on a routine basis. More efforts should be instated to discriminate between vital signs and signals that should be rapidly reported versus low-risk suspicions that may be examined and reviewed before their relay to a higher level of authority.4\nNetworks: Sophisticated technological platforms would seem to be of secondary importance. Rather, efforts should be invested in strengthening intra- and inter-networking on the local level, to enhance information sharing and continued flow of communication, based on available platforms that already exist. Such mechanisms should be identified and leveraged for the purpose of enhancing preparedness to prevent, detecting and managing public health risks.\n",
