Osteonecrosis (ON) mainly affects large joints, such as hip, that may subsequently progress to joint collapse requiring total joint replacement [3], [6]. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, there were 464,452 total hip replacements performed in 2011 [7], in which ON accounts for around 10% of all cases [8]; the total hospitalization cost of hip joint replacements in US was estimated to be around US$8 billion in 2011 [7]. The prognosis of joint replacement in SAON patients is poor due most likely to impaired osteoblast, osteocyte and osteoclast functions with steroid use leading to impaired repair and osteogenesis as well as upregulation of adipogenic potential of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) [9], [10].",

We also showed icaritin was a unique phytomolecule capable of both promoting osteogenesis as well as inhibiting adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs [14], [15]. As icaritin is a chemically stable exogenous phytomolecule, we were able to incorporate it into poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) to form a PLGA/TCP/icaritin composite porous scaffold using low-temperature rapid prototyping (RP) technology [16], [17], [18]. RP technology is becoming popular in musculoskeletal tissue engineering due to its ease, flexibility and reproducibility for manufacturing scaffolds closely mimicking structural defects with complex structures [19], [20]. The composite scaffold was tested for its efficacy as a bone defect filler for enhancing bone defect repair in both established SAON and segmental ulnar defect rabbit models; the presence of icaritin significantly induced more new bone formation in the defects, attributed to the sustained release of the bioactive phytomolecule icaritin from the composite scaffold [18], [21], [22]. However, unlike end-stage ON in human beings, rabbit is a quadrupedal animal so that no hip joint collapse would occur after SAON induction in our previous studies and also others.",

Briefly, PLGA (75:25) (Shandong Institute of Medical Instruments, Jinan, China) was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane before TCP (Beijing Organic Chemical Plant, Beijing, China) was added to form a uniform paste with a ratio of 4:1 (w/w of PLGA/TCP) by vigorous stirring overnight. Icaritin was added 320 mg per 100 g PLGA/TCP to form the PLGA/TCP/icaritin scaffold (P/T/I) based on our previous validation study [22]. Then the paste was spurted out layer-by-layer at a thickness of 500 \u03bcm and distance of 500 \u03bcm (default pore size) by a computer-driven nozzle to form a homogenous cubic porous scaffold. A demonstration scaffold measuring 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 mm3 is shown in Fig. 2\nA. The exact size of the scaffold for each study was mentioned in the corresponding section below. The fabrication temperature in the production chamber was set at \u221228 \u00b0C ensuring bioactivity of the phytomolecule icaritin. The scaffold was then lyophilized for 24 h and sealed in a plastic bag before evaluation or implantation. For comparison, pure PLGA/TCP scaffold (P/T) was also produced in a similar fashion. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless specified.",

To downscale the FEA calculation, eight voxels were downscaled into one voxel. A micro-FEA model of the emu proximal femur was created by converting bone voxels to brick elements [30]. Then the finite element meshes were imported into ABAQUS software (Dassault Syst\u00e9mes SIMULIA Inc., V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France) to perform micro-FEA. The number of brick elements in the micro-finite element model ranged from 250,706 to 588,603. Bone material properties were isotropic and linear-elastic. Young's modulus was chosen as 13.05 GPa by assuming that the elastic properties of trabecular and cortical tissues were similar [31], [32]. Poisson's ratio was set to 0.3 [33], [34]. The distal end of each model was constrained. Load was applied vertically at the femoral head [35]. The magnitude of load was initially chosen to be 10 N for each node. Supplementary Fig. S5 showed one finite element model with boundary and loading conditions. The estimated failure load was computer based on a criterion developed by Pistoia et al. [36], in which fracture was assumed to occur when 5% of the bone tissue was strained beyond a critical limit of 7000 microstrain. In these analyses, tissue-level effective strain was calculated from the strain energy density and the Young's modulus of bone using the following equation: \u03b5eff=2U/E. The estimated external load, which resulted in more than 5% of the bone tissue strained beyond 7000 microstrain, was taken as the predicted fracture load of the emu proximal femur.",

These findings demonstrated that BMSCs of SAON (+) group had a significantly impaired differentiation potential in osteogenesis accompanied with elevation of adipogenic ability.",

ALP activity at day 10 was enhanced by 70% and 179% in SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups respectively (Fig. 12\nA). Icaritin elevated ALP expression both in SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups with more obvious staining intensity change in SAON (+) group (Fig. 12B). 2) Icaritin increased calcium deposition in both SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups (Fig. 12C). Quantification of calcium nodules showed that the addition of icaritin increased the formation of calcium nodules by 43% and 71% in SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups, respectively (Fig. 12D). 3) RT-qPCR showed that COL1\u03b1, OC, RUNX2 and BMP-2 expression of SAON (+) group decreased about 4.5-fold, 3-fold, 9-fold and 4-fold compared to SAON (\u2212) group. Icaritin significantly increased COL1\u03b1, OC, RUNX2 and BMP-2 expression 7.5-fold, 5-fold, 13.5-fold and 6.5-fold in SAON (\u2212) group and 10-fold, 3-fold, 14-fold and 5-fold in SAON (+) group (Fig. 12E). 4) Lipid droplets were significantly increased by 57% in SAON (+) group compared to SAON (\u2212) group (p < 0.01); with icaritin treatment, lipid deposition decreased by 44% and 37% in SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups, respectively (Fig. 12F&G) (p < 0.01 for both). The expression of adipogenic differentiation regulatory genes C/EBP-\u03b2, PPAR-\u03b3 and aP2 in SAON (+) group was higher than SAON (\u2212) group by 15, 10 and 8 times (p < 0.01); while these two groups were treated with icaritin, the C/EBP, PPAR-\u03b3 and aP2 expression was reduced by 77%, 67%, and 55% in SAON (\u2212) group (p < 0.01) and 72%, 67% and 73% in SAON (+) group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 12H). Accordingly, the change in protein level expression of PPAR- \u03b3 and aP2 was also examined. Western blot results showed that PPAR- \u03b3 and aP2 expression was upregulated in SAON (+) group, while the expression of PPAR- \u03b3 and aP2 proteins of SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups was obviously lower after the addition of icaritin (Fig. 12I).",

More new bone formation in the bone tunnel, consistently demonstrated by micro-CT and histology, was found in P/T/I group reflecting the osteopromotive effect of the bioactive molecular icaritin. This agrees with our previous study on a SAON rabbit model that showed both P/T and P/T/I scaffolds promoted bone repair, but with better treatment efficacy or promotive effect of P/T/I on bone repair than that of P/T [18], [50]. The maximum strength and energy of ROI in the bone tunnel of P/T/I group suggested that the addition of icaritin yielded the best new bone regeneration potential to partially restore the mechanical stability of the defect. The fracture load estimation by micro-FEA revealed that the femoral head of P/T/I group could resist the largest strength. The greatly improved mechanical properties seen in P/T/I group can be explained by the better quality of new bone as assessed by micro-CT and histology.",

Articular cartilage degeneration might also be related to development of SAON under similar mechanisms, where ischemia, edema and adipogenesis in the subchondral bone could cause pathological changes in microenvironment of the articular cartilage, leading to decreased collagen synthesis and increased apoptosis of chondrocytes [52], [53] and therefore cartilage thinning that ultimately aggravating femoral head collapse. Compared with the thickness of the articular cartilage in normal healthy emus reported in our earlier study [23], the cartilage of the SAON emus in all three groups were all significantly thinner, especially at the collapsed region. However, P/T/I scaffold still performed the best in supporting the local mechanical and biological environment so as to maintain the thickness of articular cartilage of the involved joints. The ultrasound indentation test of the present study showed that P/T/I scaffold indeed helped maintained stiffness of the articular cartilage. In addition, the histomorphological results showed that P/T/I scaffold could help preserved structural composition of the articular cartilage through the osteopromotive effects of icaritin. As articular cartilage protected the subchondral bone from excessive stress, the relatively preserved cartilage in P/T/I group could prevent articular surface collapse in this group.",

Our present work has clearly shown that icaritin can promote osteogenesis during bone repair in SAON. Lipid accumulation in SAON was most likely due to the increased adipocytic differentiation of MSCs. Icaritin decreased lipid accumulation in both SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups, demonstrating that it could inhibit adipogenesis during bone repair with SAON.

Over the years, many research studies have shown that corticosteroids lead to down-regulation of BMP-2, RUNX2, COL1\u03b1 and OC expression of BMSCs in vitro and in vitro using various animal models [22], [57], [58], [59]. BMP-2 is an early osteogenic gene that modulates the promoter region of RUNX2/Cbfa1. OC is a late osteogenic gene, and suppression of BMP-2 gene expression theoretically leads to a direct decrease of OC [60]. Therefore, BMP-2 serves as the main gene affected by steroids to suppress the osteogenesis in SAON. In this study, the decrease of expression of these osteogenic markers of BMSCs from SAON (+) rabbit compared to SAON (\u2212) rabbit reconfirmed our SAON model in agreement with other studies. Icaritin promoted the expression of genes of BMSCs suggested that BMP-2 signaling pathway was involved in icaritin-mediated osteogenesis promotion [61].",

The increase in expression of these markers in SAON (+) showed that corticosteroid improved adipogenesis through C/EBP and PPAR-\u03b3 signaling pathways. C/EBPs belong to the basic-leucine zipper class of transcription factors which have been implicated in the induction of adipocyte differentiation [63]. C/EBPs are expressed before the transcription of most adipocyte-specific genes initiated and contribute to the subsequent induction of the major adipogenic transcription factors, including PPAR-\u03b3 [64]. In particular, C/EBPs and C/EBP-\u03b2 stimulate PPAR-\u03b3 activity by controlling the production of PPAR-\u03b3 ligand, and phosphorylation of C/EBP-\u03b2 is required for PPAR-\u03b3-associated downstream proteins involved in adipogenesis [65]. aP2 is expressed during adipocyte differentiation that has been regarded as a terminal differentiation marker [66]. PPAR-\u03b3 is the key transcription factor in adipocyte differentiation and plays an anti-osteoblastogenic role as the master regulator of adipogenesis [67]. After icaritin treatment, a significant inhibition of adipogenic differentiation appeared both in SAON (\u2212) and SAON (+) groups. Western blot results further confirmed that icaritin inhibited PPAR-\u03b3 and aP2 expression at protein level. This suggested that icaritin inhibited adipogenesis of BMSCs through PPAR-\u03b3-mediated pathway.",

The migration of MSCs plays an important role in organogenesis during development and tissue repair. Regulation of MSCs homing from an endogenous niche or following systemic administration to the targeted region is critical for effective tissue regeneration. The homed MSCs were reported not only to be able to offer themselves for tissue regeneration but also serve as vehicles for in vivo delivery of therapeutic genes or factors to promote repair [68]. So a strategy for bone defect treatment shall not only facilitate osteogenesis and angiogenesis, but also trigger stem cell homing. In the SAON rabbit model, both P/T and P/T/I scaffolds were shown to promote SPIO labeled MSCs homing to bone defect region after CD surgery for enhancing bone defect repair. As a void filler and drug carrier, P/T scaffold itself was demonstrated to be effective in recruiting BMSCs migration. On the other hand, not only icaritin alone upregulated VCAM1 gene of BMSCs in vitro, but its bioactivity was also well preserved in P/T/I to upregulate VCAM1 in vitro and promote SPIO labeled BMSCs migration to bone defect region in SAON rabbit model. VCAM1 plays an important role in cell\u2013cell recognition, through interacting with the beta-1 integrin very late antigen-4 (VLA4), by mediating both cell adhesion and signal transduction [69]. VCAM1 is involved in homing at the adhesion stage while VLA-4/VCAM-1 expressed by MSCs interacts with endothelial cells to promote \ufb01rm adhesion of MSCs on endothelial surface and transmigration across the endothelium [70], [71]; chemokines, e.g. SDF1, may further chemoattract MSCs from bone marrow to the injured tissue for repair enhancement [72]. SDF1 is mainly expressed by stromal and endothelial cells, and CXCR4 is a specific receptor for SDF1. The lack of effect of icaritin on CXCR4/SDF1 demonstrated that probably other migration-stimulating factors, in addition to VCAM-1, other than SDF1 were involved in mediating the stimulatory response of icaritin on BMSCs.",

However, it was critical at the outset to ensure a sustained release of icaritin from the P/T/I scaffold. We previously reported the sustainable release of about 72% icaritin from a P/T/I scaffold over a period of 12 weeks and our findings supported that the P/T scaffold was an appropriate carrier for local icaritin delivery [22]. In addition, this scaffold also showed good biocompatibility and facilitated MSCs adhesion and ingrowth, which are the essential underlying mechanism on promoting osteogenesis [17], [25]. In our recent study using an SAON rabbit model, both P/T and P/T/I scaffold showed bone healing enhancement yet with better osteopromotive effect in P/T/I scaffold [22]. The results from the current study also confirmed that icaritin could be successfully incorporated into P/T and maintained its bioactivity for enhancing bone defect repair healing in such a large bipedal emu model that was explained at least in part by its effects on attracting migration of BMSCs from remote region to the bone defect using a cost-effective rabbit model.",

            "text": "One of the limitations of the current study design was that two different animal models were used for exploring treatment efficacy and its mechanism. For bipedal animal model, emu has a body size close to that of humans suitable for testing orthopaedic biomaterials, but emu is also a large and expensive animal model for pre-clinical research. We demonstrated SAON-induced hip joint collapse in emu [23] that was explained by higher body to lower-limb weight ratio, i.e. higher mechanical loading imposed to the hip joint, which can only be induced in bipedal animal model such as emu [73], [74]. On the contrary, rabbit SAON model is a well-established, cost effective and easy-handling one yet never shows hip joint collapse due to its quadrupedal nature with body weight distribution on four limbs. However, rabbits have metabolic pathway and bone density and structure more similar to humans than aves [75], [76]. Taken together, we selected rabbits for studying the underlying mechanism of a 3-D bioactive scaffold containing an osteopromotive phytomolecule icaritin (P/T/I scaffold) at cellular and molecular level apart from limited availability of relevant antibodies and gene sequences for emu research. Although P/T/I scaffold was shown to promote BMSCs migration much better than P/T scaffold in vitro, the difference of these two scaffolds on the migration of SPIO labeled BMSCs in vivo was not obvious. This finding might be explained by an insufficient cell number and sample size for quantitative analysis, more likely that the unlabeled yet significant host circulating and local MSCs might have fundamentally contributed to the better treatment effects of P/T/I scaffold for bone defect repair in the current study.",
