These specialized niches are generated and maintained by different sets of vascular and mesenchymal stromal cells (Randall et al., 2008; Turley et al., 2010). The mesenchymal stromal cell network of the LN T cell zone is formed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) which are characterized by the expression of podoplanin (PDPN), and extracellular matrix proteins such as ERTR-7 and collagen-I (Malhotra et al., 2012). Furthermore, FRCs regulate immune homeostasis and reactivity through the production of homeostatic chemokines, the immune-regulatory cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) (Link et al., 2007), and small molecules such as nitric oxide (Lukacs-Kornek et al., 2011; Siegert et al., 2011). However, although LN FRCs are phenotypically well-characterized (Katakai et al., 2004; Malhotra et al., 2012), their development from mesenchymal precursors has remained elusive.",

            "text": "The differentiation of FRCs from their progenitor(s) is thought to be closely linked to lymphoid organogenesis. The early steps of both LN and Peyer\u2019s patch (PP) organogenesis involve the appearance of hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells in the respective anlagen (Mebius et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 1999). Lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-mediated interaction of LTi cells with mesenchymal stromal cells in the LN or PP anlage is thought to be critical for their further development (van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010; Randall et al., 2008). Indeed, mice lacking LTi cells fail to generate both LNs and PPs (Eberl et al., 2004; Boos et al., 2007) and molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family expressed by LTi cells provide essential signals for the developing SLOs (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997; Kong et al., 1999). LT\u03b2R engagement on stromal cells appears to be particularly important because the expression of IL-7, C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and CCL21 generates a positive feedback loop that attracts and activates further LTi cells (Honda et al., 2001; Ohl et al., 2003). Mesenchymal stromal cells interacting with LTi cells during prenatal stages of SLO development are commonly referred to as lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells and have been described as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)-expressing cells that appear around embryonic day (E) 16 in the murine LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007). Gene-expression analysis revealed that these cells provide molecules involved in LN organogenesis including LT\u03b2R, RANKL, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and IL-7 (Cupedo et al., 2004c; B\u00e9n\u00e9zech et al., 2010). However, neither global gene ablation of LT\u03b2R-ligands (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997) or the LT\u03b2R itself (F\u00fctterer et al., 1998), nor LT\u03b2R expression on mesenchymal stromal cells of the LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007; B\u00e9n\u00e9zech et al., 2010) has allowed for the determination of the developmental window of LT\u03b2R-dependent mesenchymal LTo cell stimulation that is critical for LN or PP development.",

Here, we report the generation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mouse model that utilizes the Ccl19 promoter to target the Cre recombinase specifically to mesenchymal stromal cells of the developing LN and to FRCs and FRC-like cells in adult LNs and PPs, respectively. Surprisingly, ablation of the LT\u03b2R on Ccl19-cre\n+ mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN development. Moreover, although the maturation of LN FRCs from myofibroblastic precursors was blocked in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice, the basic infrastructure of the adult LN with T and B cell zone segregation and a functional conduit system was established. However, Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice were immunodeficient because myofibroblastic FRC precursors were devoid of essential immune-stimulatory properties such as production of homeostatic chemokines and IL-7. Moreover, conditionally FRC-deficient animals showed an impaired resistance to viral infection, indicating that LT\u03b2R-mediated FRC maturation is critical for the maintenance of immunocompentence.",

However, neither of these markers is truly FRC-specific. For example, PDPN is expressed on different stromal cell populations (Malhotra et al., 2012) and hence Pdpn-cre transgenes target both PDPN+CD31\u2212 FRCs and PDPN+CD31+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) (Onder et al., 2011). Here, we utilized the Ccl19 promoter to direct Cre recombinase expression to LN FRCs. To silence the Ccl21 gene, which is in close proximity to the Ccl19 locus, the murine Ccl21 gene was replaced by the human CD8 gene in the BAC construct. Crossing of transgenic lines with R26-eyfp reporter mice (Srinivas et al., 2001) facilitated screening for founders with exclusive transgene expression in nonhematopoietic cells (Figure 1\nA; see also Figures S1A and S1B available online). Because two out of seven founder lines showed identical stromal cell-specific transgene expression, all further analyses were performed with founder line 1 designated as Ccl19-cre. Staining of CD45\u2212 LN cells with antibodies against PDPN and CD31 revealed a normal LN stromal cell composition in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 R26-eyfp mice (Figure 1B). Importantly, FRC specificity was high with 80%\u201390% of the EYFP signal being directed to the PDPN+CD31\u2212 fraction (Figures 1C and 1D). In situ analysis using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that Ccl19-cre\n+ cells were found mainly in the T cell zone and in interfollicular regions of the LN (Figure 1E). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of high-resolution microscopic analyses showed that the transgene was expressed uniformly in the PDPN+ERTR7+ reticular T cell zone network (Figure 1F). Furthermore, FRCs ensheathing CD31+ high endothelial venules (HEVs) were transgene-positive (Figure 1G). Ccl19-cre\n+ LN FRCs expressed CCL21 (Figure 1H, arrows) and CCL19 (Figure 1I, arrows) indicating that the Ccl19-cre transgene targets both past and present CCL19 expression in these nonhematopoietic cells.",

Ccl19-cre transgene activity was highest in the DN cell population (Figures S1C and S1D) with EYFP+ cells being dispersed in all compartments of the white pulp (Figure S1E). High densities of transgene-positive cells could be detected in the area of the marginal zone (Figure S1F) and around central arterioles (Figure S1G). In contrast, transgene activity in PP stromal cells was high in PDPN+CD31\u2212 cells and moderate in DN cells with around 80% and 20% of all EYFP+ cells, respectively (Figures S1H and S1I). Because PDPN+CD31\u2212 cells in PPs are still undefined, we have referred to them as FRC-like cells. Transgene-positive cells were rare in subdomal areas and more dense in the abluminal part of the PP (Figure S1J), but associated both with T cell- and B cell-rich areas (Figure S1K), suggesting that PP FRC-like cells are involved in the orchestration of both T and B cell responses. Taken together, the Ccl19-cre transgene permits in vivo targeting of LN FRCs and FRC-like cells of PPs.",

We found that Ccl19-cre\n+ stromal cells were highly abundant in the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage (Figures 2\nA; Figure S2A). Furthermore, the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage had attracted CD4+ LTi cells, which most likely deliver the necessary LT\u03b11\u03b22 for stimulation of the LT\u03b2R on mesenchymal stromal organizer cells. The number of Ccl19-cre\n+ stromal cells grew approximately 3-fold until E18.5, whereas the CD4+ LTi cell population expanded only modestly (Figure 2B; Figure S2B). To assess whether Cre-recombinase expression reflected the kinetics of Ccl19 expression in developing LNs, we determined both Cre-recombinase and Ccl19 mRNA production in neonatal and week 2 and six LN homogenates by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Endogenous Ccl19 expression (Figure 2C) correlated well with Cre expression (Figure 2D) driven by the Ccl19 promoter on the BAC transgene. In contrast, Ltbr expression fluctuated with the highest expression being measureable in the neonatal LN (Figure 2E). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that Ccl19-cre transgene expression was highly abundant in neonatal inguinal LNs (Figure 2F, left panels). 3D reconstruction of high-resolution analyses indicated that Ccl19-cre-expressing stromal cells in the developing LN had formed a dense network (Figure 2F, right panels) reminiscent of the FRC network in the adult LN. Whereas Ccl19-cre\n+ stromal cells expressed low amounts of PDPN, the mesenchymal markers smooth muscle actin (SMA) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) were highly expressed (Figure 2G), indicating that the Ccl19-cre transgene targets mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs.",

Because lymphocytes are rare in neonatal LNs and LT\u03b2R-dependent stimulation of mesenchymal stromal cells is mainly provided by LTi cells (Cupedo et al., 2004b; White et al., 2007), it is most likely that Ccl19-cre\n+ mesenchymal stromal cell in neonatal LNs received LT\u03b2R signals from LTi cells. Interestingly, deletion of the LT\u03b2R on Ccl19-cre\n+ mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN formation (Figure 2H). Furthermore, formation of a stromal cell network in neonatal LNs was not affected by mesenchymal stromal cell-specific LT\u03b2R-ablation (Figure 2H, right panels). Likewise, expression of SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 (Figure 2I) was not altered by the selective LT\u03b2R-ablation. Gross pathological examination of adult Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice (4\u20136 weeks) after injection of Evan\u2019s Blue revealed that all LNs were present (data not shown). In contrast, Ccl19-cre-dependent ablation of the LT\u03b2R in PPs led to significantly reduced PP numbers (Figure S2C). Taken together, these data indicate that Ccl19-cre expression in PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs in a developmental window of critical LT\u03b2R-sensitivity. Conversely, Ccl19-cre-expressing mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs do not require LT\u03b2R signals to facilitate LN formation.",

Quantification of the 3D data showed that conditionally LT\u03b2R-deficient LNs were approximately 25%\u201330% smaller than control LNs (Figure 3B) and exhibited a comparable reduction in B cell follicle size (Figure 3C), HEV length (Figure 3D), and complexity of the HEV network (Figure 3E). The OPT-based finding that LNs with FRC-specific LT\u03b2R-deficiency were still able to establish the basic LN infrastructure was supported by confocal microscopy, which showed that LNs had generated clearly distinguishable T and B cell zones (Figure 3F). The global reduction of LN size without specific impairment of substructures was reflected by the comparable reduction of various hematopoietic cell populations (Figure 3G). Thus, FRC-specific ablation of LT\u03b2R-signaling did not affect the formation of the basic LN structure with clear T and B cell zone segregation.",

Flow cytometric analysis revealed a loss of PDPN+CD31\u2212 cells that coincided with a significant increase of PDPN\u2212CD31\u2212 cells (Figure 4\nA). Importantly, the remaining PDPN+CD31\u2212 cells had lost LT\u03b2R expression (Figures 4B and 4C). Confocal microscopic analysis confirmed the substantial reduction of PDPN expression in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl LNs (Figure 4D). However, ERTR7 protein production and the formation of the fibroblastic reticular network was not affected by FRC-specific LT\u03b2R ablation (Figure 4D). Moreover, the fibroblastic network still generated ERTR7-ensheathed collagen bundles (Figure 4E), i.e., the conduit system, which rapidly drained small molecules through the T cell zone, both in the presence and absence of LT\u03b2R on T cell zone reticular cells (Figure 4F). T cell zone reticular cells both in the LN parenchyma and surrounding HEVs had lost CCL21 positivity in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl LNs, whereas vascular endothelial cells in HEVs still produced this chemokine (Figure 4G). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of whole LN homogenates confirmed the substantial loss of Ccl21 mRNA expression in conditionally LT\u03b2R-deficient LNs (Figure 4H). Moreover, Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl LNs produced significantly less Ccl19 (Figure 4I) and Il7 (Figure 4J) mRNA but almost normal amounts of the B cell zone chemokine Cxcl13 (Figure 4K). Taken together, these data show that Ccl19 promoter-dependent LT\u03b2R-ablation profoundly altered the LN stromal cell composition and abolished expression of molecules in T cell zone reticular cells, which are considered part of the molecular signature of FRCs.",

Indeed, in vitro culture of sorted DN cells from Ccl19-cre \u00d7 R26-eyfp LNs in the presence of LTi cells resulted in activation of the Ccl19 promoter (Figures S3A\u2013S3C). Moreover, upregulation of EYFP was accompanied by a pronounced increase in PDPN expression (Figure S3D). Crossing of Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice with R26-eyfp reporter mice confirmed that genetically labeled (i.e., EYFP+) FRCs emerge from DN precursors in a LT\u03b2R gene dose-dependent fashion (Figures 5A and 5B). LT\u03b2R-dependent FRC maturation was associated not only with the upregulation of PDPN (Figure 5A) but also with a substantial increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression (Figure 5C). Likewise, EYFP+PDPNlo cells from Ccl19-cre \u00d7 R26-eyfp LNs expressed moderate amounts of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (Figure S3E). To further characterize the phenotypical changes associated with LT\u03b2R-dependent FRC differentiation, we first determined the expression of myofibroblast and pericyte markers in LN stromal cell preparations. As shown in Figure 5D, abortion of FRC maturation was associated with increased Acta2, Cnn1, and Pdgfrb mRNA expression, whereas Pdgfra and Cspg4 mRNA expression was not affected. Confocal microscopy confirmed upregulation of SMA in myofibroblastic FRC precursors surrounding HEVs (Figure 5E) and in the T cell zone network (Figure 5F, arrowheads). Likewise, PDGFR\u03b2 was upregulated in FRC precursors in both locations (Figure 5G), whereas perivascularly expressed calponin-1 was specifically upregulated in myofibroblastic cells in the T cell zone network (Figure 5H). In contrast, the expression of the pericyte marker NG2 around small blood vessels was not affected by the selective LT\u03b2R-deficiency (Figure 5I). Thus, myofibroblastic FRC precursors require LT\u03b2R stimulation to acquire the characteristic mature phenotype with the expression of homeostatic and immune-regulatory molecules.",

            "text": "To determine the functional consequences of FRC-specific LT\u03b2R-deficiency on intranodal T cell migration, we utilized intravital 2-photon microscopy. Adoptive transfer of C57BL/6 T cells into Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice or control mice revealed a significant reduction of T cell speed in the T cell zone parenchyma under conditions of selective LT\u03b2R-ablation, with an average speed close to Ccr7\n\u2212/\u2212 T cells (Figure 6\nA). In contrast, T cell speed around HEVs was not affected by the absence of mature FRCs (Figure 6A). Because T cell motility within the T cell zone parenchyma is partially dependent on CCR7-mediated signals (Worbs et al., 2007; Figure 6A), we assessed whether LT\u03b2R-dependent FRC maturation with upregulation of CCR7 ligands impacts on dendritic cell (DC)-CD8+ T cell interaction. To this end, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-specific CD8+ T cells expressing a T cell receptor recognizing the H2-Kb-binding S598 epitope were adoptively transferred into Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl or LT\u03b2R-competent control mice. Subsequent subcutaneous injection of S598-pulsed DCs revealed that the conditional LT\u03b2R ablation did not lead to a reduction of DC-mediated T cell activation (Figures S4A and S4B). Next, we assessed whether the conditional LT\u03b2R-deficiency affects global immune responsiveness in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice by using systemic infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) WE strain, which is controlled in a CD8+ T cell and perforin-dependent manner (K\u00e4gi et al., 1994). Conditionally LT\u03b2R-deficient mice failed to reduce viral titers in LNs and to clear the virus from peripheral organs such as the kidney by day 8 postinfection (Figure S4C). Furthermore, Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice showed significantly reduced antiviral T cell responses in LNs (Figure S4D), indicating a globally reduced capacity to cope with viral infections when LN FRCs fail to generate an immune-stimulatory environment. However, under conditions of systemic LCMV distribution, other factors than deficient LN FRC maturation, such as the lack of PPs, could have contributed to the observed immunodeficiency in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice. Therefore, we resorted to an infection system with exclusive replication in a tissue-draining LN. Following intranasal application, the murine coronavirus MHV establishes an infection in the central nervous system (CNS) during which systemic spread is prevented by swift induction of antiviral immune responses in the cervical LN (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1n et al., 2009; Gil-Cruz et al., 2012). Successful control of the acute MHV infection depends on type I interferon (IFN)-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012b) and both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Bergmann et al., 2006). To assess the impact of the relative deficiency of CCR7 ligands in LN stromal cells of Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice, we compared conditionally LT\u03b2R-deficient mice with plt/plt mice, which lack the expression of CCR7 ligands specifically in secondary lymphoid organs (Gunn et al., 1999). We found that mice with FRC-specific LT\u03b2R deficiency showed a more dramatic weight loss compared to plt/plt mice (Figure 6B) and exhibited higher viral titers in the CNS at day 10 postinfection (Figure 6C). The failure of both Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl and plt/plt mice to clear the virus from the CNS and hence to prevent weight loss is most likely due to the strongly impaired antiviral T cell response in this vulnerable organ (Figure 6D). Interestingly, recruitment of fully activated IFN-\u03b3-secreting effector T cells (Figures 6E and 6F) was reduced in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl compared to plt/plt mice indicating that the impaired antiviral immunity in Ccl19-cre \u00d7 Ltbr\nfl/fl mice can only be partially explained by the lack of CCL19 and CCL21 within the CNS-draining LN. Taken together, these data indicate that LT\u03b2R-mediated maturation of LN FRCs is critical for the generation of protective antiviral T cell responses.",

These precursors develop into the mesenchymal LTo cell defined by intermediate to high ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and the concomitant upregulation of essential molecules involved in LN organogenesis, including CCL19 (B\u00e9n\u00e9zech et al., 2010) Notably, LT\u03b2R and the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) are highly expressed on both the mesenchymal precursor and the mesenchymal LTo cell (B\u00e9n\u00e9zech et al., 2010) whereby LT\u03b2R signaling in the mesenchymal precursor is critical for the transition to the ICAM-1+VCAM-1+ mesenchymal LTo cells (White et al., 2007). However, ablation of LT\u03b2R signaling in mesenchymal stromal cells in the developing LN, i.e., ICAM-1+VCAM-1+ stromal cells expressing CCL19 in our model, did not prohibit the formation of LNs and the transition of the mesenchymal stromal cells of the prenatal LN into myofibroblastic FRC precursors (pre-FRCs) in postnatal LNs. Importantly, progression toward the immune-stimulatory, mature FRC was strictly dependent on LT\u03b2R signaling. Thus, our data together with previous studies (White et al., 2007; B\u00e9n\u00e9zech et al., 2010) indicate that LN mesenchymal stromal cell development is characterized by two distinct developmental windows of critical LT\u03b2R signaling, i.e., initially during the transition of the mesenchymal precursor to the mesenchymal LTo cells and as a final maturation stimulus for T cell zone FRCs.",

Again, LT\u03b2R-mediated stimulation of mesenchymal LTo cells triggers production of homeostatic cytokines and IL-7, which are essential for PP development (Adachi et al., 1998; Finke et al., 2002). The results of our study indicate that CCL19 expression in developing PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs during a critical phase of LT\u03b2R sensitivity. In contrast, LT\u03b2R signaling in Ccl19-Cre\n+ mesenchymal stromal cells in LN anlagen was not mandatory for LN development. However, the presence of the LT\u03b2R on endothelial cells appears to be essential during early stages of LN formation (Onder et al., 2013). Future studies utilizing the Ccl19-Cre model and other stromal cell-specific Cre-driver mice will provide a comprehensive characterization of the critical LT\u03b2R-sensitive stage during LTo development in LNs and PPs.",

Our analysis indicates that the basic infrastructure of the LN including the conduit system and the HEV network is generated by myofibroblastic FRC-precursors in an LT\u03b2R-independent fashion. It remains to be determined whether other receptors involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as RANKL or TNFR1 compensate for the lack of LT\u03b2R. Clearly, LT\u03b2R-signaling was necessary for the maturation of FRCs from PDPN-negative myofibroblastic precursors and the optimal support of antiviral immunity provided by the adaptive immune system. Following exposure to inflammatory stimuli, FRCs respond with an activation program that leads to upregulation of molecules involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (Vega et al., 2006; Malhotra et al., 2012). Hence, it is likely the LT\u03b2R-mediated stimulation of pre-FRCs serves as a critical switch for global immune responsiveness by unleashing the full immune-stimulatory capacity of the mature FRC.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study provides further evidence for a common theme in mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation, namely the LT\u03b2R-dependent conversion of a sessile myofibroblast into an immunologically highly active stromal cell. Such profound LT\u03b2R-mediated transformation into FRC-like cells has been described for vascular smooth-muscle cells during the formation of organized lymphoid follicles surrounding heavily atherosclerotic aortas (L\u00f6tzer et al., 2010). Likewise, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that develop in ectopic lymphoid tissues can descend from PDGFR\u03b2-expressing perivascular precursors (Krautler et al., 2012). Interestingly, only the final maturation of FDCs into immunologically active cells was dependent on lymphotoxin-mediated signals. Whereas FDCs in ectopic lymphoid tissues can emerge from ubiquitous perivascular precursors (Krautler et al., 2012), mature LN FRCs originate from PDPN-negative myofibroblastic progenitors that can form the global stromal cell network of the developing LN and that are distributed throughout the T cell zone and interfollicular regions of the adult LN. Despite the remaining unknowns concerning the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells of secondary and tertiary lymphoid organs, the results of this study suggest that timing of LT\u03b2R targeting for the attenuation of exaggerated immune responses may be critical (Browning, 2008), i.e., mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation should be blocked before the stage of the immunologically fully active FRC\u2014or FDC\u2014has been reached.",

The coding sequence for the Cre-recombinase and a truncated form of the human CD4 gene, separated by an IRES sequence and including a stop codon, was inserted into Ccl19 exon 1 utilizing the endogenous ATG translation start codon on the 180 kb BAC RP23 446D10 (Invitrogen). Because the Ccl21b gene is in close proximity to Ccl19, the Ccl21b gene was deleted on the BAC by inserting the human CD8 gene into the first exon of the Ccl21b locus. The BAC carried at least 90 kb of sequence upstream of the Ccl19 transcription start site. Integration of the Cre-recombinase was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Modified BACs were screened with 5\u2032ATG PCR (forward 5\u2032-GCACACGAATGTGGATGTTC-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-CTGCACACAGACAGGAGCAT-3\u2032) and 3\u2032polyA PCR (forward 5\u2032-ATGTGGCAGTGTCTGCTGAG-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-CCTGTAGCCAGAGGTTGGAG-3\u2032). Founder lines were genotyped by PCR by using the following primers: forward 5\u2032-TCTCTGCCCAGAGTCATCCT-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-ATGCTCCTGTCTGTGTGCAG-3\u2032. B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Hjf (R26-eyfp) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Ltbr\nfl/fl mice (Wimmer et al., 2012) were described previously.
