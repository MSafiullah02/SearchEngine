The vision of establishing programs that focus on emerging infectious disease detection and response evolved into what are now called Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Centers. The GDD program was established in 2004 to provide support for the CDC's international programs and was expanded to include the IEIP and other programs as part of the GDD Regional Centers when CDC's Center for Global Health was established in 2010 [1]. The GDD Program builds global capacity to identify and respond to emerging diseases, and to conduct applied public health research on disease prevention and control [2]. The GDD Centers include 6 programs that support their host countries in building capacity to comply with the Revised International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). The 3 core programs are the International Emerging Infections Program, the cornerstone of the GDD Centers that serves as a platform to study emerging diseases and their prevention and control; the Field Epidemiology Training Program, which trains scientists in applied epidemiology and public health laboratory science; and the Influenza Program, which supports detection and response for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The remaining 3 GDD programs include the One Health Program, integrating animal and human health investigations of zoonotic diseases; the Strengthening Laboratory Capacity Program; and the Risk Communication and Emergency Response Program, supporting health communication and helping countries establish infrastructure for Emergency Operations Centers and systems. Some GDD Centers additionally have a Refugee Health Program that works closely with IEIP and other GDD programs.",

In Thailand, where healthcare utilization rates are high even in rural settings (Sa Kaeo and Nahkhon Phanom) [3, 4], hospital-based surveillance was established to identify cases of moderate to severe illness. In contrast, in Kenya, where healthcare utilization\u2014even for cases of severe illness\u2014is low both in urban [5] and rural [6] areas, a community-based system was established. This system consists of biweekly household visits during which information about illness is collected for all household members, and patients with serious illness are referred to the study clinic where more detailed clinical information and specimens are collected. Because hospital-based systems are relatively inexpensive to operate [7], they can cover large populations. In a community-based system with household visits, large population sizes would require resources beyond those available for conducting population-based surveillance. Large hospital-based systems provide more capacity to detect emerging pathogens and provide larger sample sizes for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Rigorous community-based systems provide greater opportunities to evaluate transmission rates, determinants, and risk factors for common diseases, and sometimes yield incidence rates inclusive of more disease episodes; however, the smaller surveillance area limits the ability to fully define the spectrum of illness caused by particular pathogens.\n",

Most sites also track subsets of ARI cases: influenza-like illness among outpatients; severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) among hospitalized patients, and pneumonia, which may apply to outpatients or inpatients (Table 2). Respiratory specimens from enrolled patients are collected for molecular diagnostic testing principally using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Sites test respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a core IEIP respiratory diagnostic panel of viral pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, and human metapneumovirus. A detailed description of the GDD laboratory program, including methods used to identity RSV and other respiratory pathogens, is included in this journal supplement [8].

Some sites also collect and store sera from febrile patients as part of acute febrile illness surveillance for emerging zoonotic diseases, and occasionally use sera from the subset of febrile patients meeting respiratory surveillance criteria for serologic studies of respiratory pathogens. In Kenya, acute and convalescent sera have been tested by serology for influenza viruses, RSV, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses in a special study to evaluate the additional diagnostic yield of serology for respiratory pathogens in addition to PCR [9]. In the event of an apparently newly introduced pathogen, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), these banked sera could be used to assess the extent of disease by evaluating the seroprevalence of antibodies or seroincidence of infection, as well as evaluating whether the pathogen was circulating previously without detection. In Thailand, paired sera have been tested for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Legionella longbeachae, and Coxiella burnetii; in Bangladesh, paired sera have been tested for respiratory pathogens from patients with fever and/or ARI and acute lower respiratory infection. Respiratory specimens from matched healthy controls have been useful to determine usual rates of asymptomatic infection with respiratory viruses (especially adenoviruses and rhinoviruses) and colonization with S. pneumoniae and other bacteria for estimation of pathogen-attributable fractions of lower respiratory tract disease [10\u201312].",

These differences are partially due to site-specific differences in local laboratory capacity, standards of clinical care, limitations in the use, quality, and interpretation of routine diagnostics (eg, blood cultures and chest radiographs), and healthcare-seeking behaviors of the population under surveillance. A universal challenge is the aseptic collection of blood for culture and adequate capacity for processing. Because of the challenges of implementing blood culture, estimates of invasive bacterial infections, particularly bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, are uncertain. However, some sites, such as Bangladesh and Kenya, have successfully incorporated blood culture into their surveillance, enabling measurement of the proportion of invasive pneumococcal disease that may be prevented with use of newly developed conjugate vaccines [20] and documenting that blood culture\u2013confirmed typhoid fever can be associated with significant respiratory manifestations [21]. Investigators in the GDD Regional Center in Thailand found that prior use of antibiotics (measured by serum antimicrobial drug levels) reduced the incidence estimates for pneumococcal bacteremia by 32% overall and 39% in children <5 years of age [22].",

Thus, the novel MERS-CoV first identified in 2012 among patients in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan [26\u201328] can be examined as a cause of respiratory illness by testing prospective as well as archived samples from IEIP surveillance sites run by the GDD Regional Center in Egypt and other GDD Centers, surveillance sites run by other GDD programs (eg, Influenza, One Health, and Refugee Health), and affiliated surveillance networks (eg, the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infections Surveillance (EMARIS) sites established by the GDD Regional Center in Egypt, the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, and its member states). Likewise, the sites are well poised to evaluate new diagnostic testing technologies, including multiple pathogen assays like the TaqMan array card (TAC), which tests for a variety of pathogens with one specimen [29]. Technologies like TAC allow archived specimens collected over multiple years to be tested at one time, presenting the possibility to rapidly characterize a vast array of ARI etiologies in multiple geographic locations with varied ecologic and demographic features. Using well-characterized clinical, demographic, and geographic information, the IEIP population-based surveillance sites are able to describe seasonality, risk factors, and spectrum of disease of newly identified pathogens.",

            "text": "This journal supplement highlights the value of population-based surveillance systems such as those initiated or catalyzed by GDD IEIP sites. This multicountry network of population-based surveillance sites provides a platform to test a variety of interventions in settings where ecology, economics, ethnicity, politics, predominant co-morbidities and co-infecting pathogens, and behavior vary, thereby providing a useful tool to design optimal intervention strategies targeted to each setting. GDD IEIP surveillance data also provides a stimulus for more urgent development of novel vaccines and therapeutics for RSV and other diseases by demonstrating their burden and severity and are poised to assess the effectiveness, acceptance, and value of these tools compared with other prevention strategies. Given the consistency in laboratory testing methods, the approach to surveillance of respiratory infections undertaken by GDD IEIP sites enables comparison of the burden of RSV disease and its epidemiology among the 6 geographically and sociopolitically diverse countries. Longitudinal surveillance data from these sites, combined with those from GDD Influenza Program sites, will add to the global understanding of RSV-associated mortality and risk factors for severe disease and death in low- and middle-income countries, result in better descriptions of RSV seasonality, and inform intervention strategies to mitigate the burden of RSV-associated disease. The IEIP-run surveillance sites are well positioned to serve as platforms for future RSV vaccine efficacy or effectiveness studies in low- and middle-income countries, and to evaluate the utility and feasibility of RSV prophylaxis in these settings. Ultimately, the evidence generated by studies from GDD IEIP surveillance sites can inform countries' determinations of their public health priorities and generate the political will to implement effective prevention and control measures, through evidence-based policy change.",
