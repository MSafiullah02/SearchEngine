Younger children with several underlying conditions, including chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency disorders, are at higher risk for hospital admission for bronchiolitis. In contrast, previously healthy term infants often present with milder symptoms, although some studies report more serious manifestations including respiratory distress, hypoxia, or severe apnoea spells, which may eventually require intensive care (1). Although chronic debilitating diseases undoubtedly increase the risk for intensive care admission for bronchiolitis, the widespread use of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants at high risk has in the past few years reduced the absolute number of these infants admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) (2) and proportionally increased the number of infants born at term, who have no known risk factors. To assess these low risk infants better on admission and to provide optimal hospital care to those who are likely to deteriorate and require intensive care, we need to know more about their clinical features and factors predicting severity.",

Although from 42 to 45% hospital admissions for lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 2 years of age are related to RSV (10), reports in recent years increasingly implicate as agents causing bronchiolitis other viruses including rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) (11).",

Apnoea spells triggered by infectious agents, such as RSV acting on an immature respiratory control, are an additional risk factor for PICU admission and respiratory support in the youngest infants.

The lack of correlation between epidemiologic factors and severe bronchiolitis contrasts with the results of outcome trials which identified crowding and exposure to tobacco smoke as significant and independent risk factors for disease severity of RSV bronchiolitis (18). This discrepancy probably reflects the clinical characteristics of the population included in the previous studies, such as older infants up to 36 months and infants with recurrent wheezing. For example, Jartti et al. (14) showed that epidemiologic features such as atopy affect the characteristics of bronchiolitis mainly in older infants or in those with previous wheezing episodes.",

Although many hospitals require children with bronchiolitis to undergo chest radiography on admission not all investigators agree that taking radiographs is beneficial (20). Another noteworthy finding of practical clinical interest in this study is that the most seriously ill infants had significantly increased CRP levels. This datum may provide further circumstantial evidence that bacterial co\u2010infection may aggravate the clinical course of infants with bronchiolitis.",

Lymphopenia is a common finding in patients with infections related to RSV or other viruses (21). Lymphopenia can be caused either by endogenous glucocorticoids secondary to a stress mechanism (22) or by corticosteroid treatment, although other investigators propose that lymphopenia may be related to increased prolactin and low leptin levels (23). Regardless of the pathogenesis, low lymphocyte counts call into question the status of lymphokines and their prognostic implications in bronchiolitis.",

Our observations are in line with previous findings by Richards et al. (24) and Stempel et al. (25) who respectively found percentages of RSV in 72.2% and 77% of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Our results nevertheless differ from those of Richards et al. who found no difference in the frequency of RSV detection between infants who were hospitalized in a short\u2010term unit and those requiring PICU admission. These discrepancies may depend on the different population studied, i.e. with or without infants with chronic debilitating conditions that are known to affect the risk for disease severity. In their study designed to investigate the specific mechanisms leading to severe bronchiolitis in healthy full\u2010term infants younger than 6 months of age, Helminen et al. studied the infants\u2019 genetic background according to the specific viral aetiology and found no difference in genetic polymorphisms between RSV infected infants and controls. These observations imply that hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis may depend on other factors, such as young age (26).",

The discrepancies probably depend on the criteria used to define severity as well as different patients\u2019 age on admission. Confirming the importance of age, Jartti et al. (14) have shown that the prevalence of RV\u2010associated bronchiolitis increases with age and with recurrent wheezing episodes. Dual viral infections were uncommon in our study (11%). Our results match those recently published by Marguet et al.
