Autologous transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells preserves endothelial function and maintains the integrity of the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, whereas administration of mesenchymal stem cells reduces the severity of ALI/ARDS in mice.35 Patients with pneumonia36 and ALI/ARDS37 have higher levels of endothelial progenitor cells, and these higher levels correlate with improved outcome. Mesenchymal stem cells were originally thought to act as a source of regenerative cells by differentiating into, and locally replacing, lethally injured cells. However, their primary mechanism of action may be through the secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules to cause the trophic modulation of inflammation, cell death, fibrosis, and tissue repair.38\n",
