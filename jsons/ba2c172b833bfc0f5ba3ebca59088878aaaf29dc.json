Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo truecolour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation,",

Within and around the historical city, wastewater discharge is also a source of dissolved and suspended matter due to the lack of a sewage system (e.g. Dabal\u00e0 et al., 2005; Zaggia et al., 2007) .",

Further, using ACOLITE, water leaving reflectances were converted into turbidity (expressed in formazin nephelometric unit [FNU]), following Dogliotti et al. (2015) . To assess the accuracy of turbidity products derived from S2 imagery, in situ data collected at the Lido inlet were used. In particular, turbidity profiles were recorded during field activities from 2017 onwards with a SeaPoint turbidity meter (SeaPoint\u00ae) and continuous data were available, from January 2020, by an OBS501 turbidity meter (Campbell Scientific\u00ae), positioned at 2 m depth (L in Fig.1 ). The correlation for 140 match-ups J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 between satellite-derived estimates of turbidity versus in situ measurements was statistically significant with a coefficient of correlation r of 0.957, a coefficient of determination R 2 of 0.917, a RMSE of 1.45 (Fig. 2) . These results are consistent with the accuracy assessed for ACOLITE-derived turbidity retrieved from Landsat 8 in the North Adriatic coastal waters (Braga et al., 2017) . In the absence of available monitoring data, we estimated the intensity of local water traffic from the comparative analysis of significant wave height (Hs) data records for Misericordia and AAOT, even if Hs does not generally apply to the analysis of boat wakes. The Misericordia station is located in an area of heavy traffic, that induces a continuum of perturbations from a multitude of direct waves and reflections from channel sides. During periods of no wind-waves, Hs can then be used as a proxy of the overall effects of traffic on the water surface. Therefore, the mean of Hs values ( \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 ) at Misericordia station was calculated for each period when Hs at AAOT station (not affected by traffic) was lower than 0.2 m and longer than 24 hr, thus excluding wind-wave intervals.",

The reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was observable. On February 20th (Fig. 3A) , the density of white wakes, that trace the moving boats, was relatively high alongside the large tidal channel of Giudecca and the Grand Canal, in the heart of the city (G and C, respectively, in Fig. 1 ). Particularly evident were also the wakes of speedboats and waterbuses connecting the city to the airport, north of the image area, and the other islands to the west. The situation recorded by the image was close to normal, as this was the busiest week of the Venice Carnival that attracts thousands of visitors to the city. On March 19th (Fig. 3B) , the lockdown was already enforced with strict social distancing measures, the closing of commercial activities and boat traffic almost stopped. Few boat wakes were still visible around the city of Venice. The lagoon water was clearer with less suspended matter in the channels surrounding the city, particularly from Venice to Murano, towards the airport and the channel at east of Murano. (Fig. 5 A and B) . On February 20th 2020 (Fig. 5A ), the resuspension due to the wakes of speedboats, water taxis and airport shuttles, was quite intense in the channel connecting the airport water terminal to the city and in the nearest areas of the adjacent sub-tidal flats, where the turbidity reached about 50 FNU. In the map of March 19th (Fig. 5B) , when the lockdown was in place and boat traffic almost stopped, the turbidity in the channel and the airport harbour was comparable to that observed around the city (~5 FNU).",

These originate within the clam harvesting concession areas where bottom sediments are mobilised by the shellfishing gears as point sources. The activity, normally performed on weekdays, is a recurrent source of suspended particles which are then diffused across the subtidal flats. On weekends and holidays, this perturbation is normally absent as shown by the maps in S2 supplementary material (cf. April 5th, 13th, 25th). Clam harvesting plumes could not be clearly delineated on the April 15th map (Fig. 5C) , because of the higher background turbidity due to wind-driven resuspension. In the same area, also distinguishable is a plume of low-turbidity water ebbing from the airport water terminal, sheltered from the wind, into the sub-tidal flat. This situation was never observed before in the presence of traffic. In the terminal, turbid water (35-60 FNU) is normally maintained by turbulence, due to boat manoeuvres (Fig. 5A) . This water mixes with the relatively less turbid water of adjacent shallows in ebb tide. Commercial shipping is one of the essential activities that continued throughout the lockdown and was not subjected to restrictions (GURI, 2020b,c) , as confirmed by official port of Venice throughput statistics for the first trimester of 2020 (North Adriatic Sea Port Authority, 2020). It is not frequent that a satellite image captures the passage of a commercial vessel in the navigation channel and only a few such images are available in the Copernicus catalogue. Fig. 6 shows an example of the transit of a cargo ship in the Malamocco-Marghera Channel (MMC; Fig.1 ) which is locally 60 m wide and 11 m deep. Consistent with the northern lagoon on other dates (Fig. 5) , the turbidity ranged 3-10 FNU in the central lagoon basin, on April 3rd. The ship wakes increased suspended particulate in the channel as well as on sub-tidal flats, and the impacts are visible both in the true-colour composite (Fig. 6A) , as brown resuspended clouds, and in the turbidity map ( ",

Particularly affected are the St. Mark's basin and the Giudecca Channel, where the regular traffic shares the channels with large cruise ships that during the warm season, commonly amount to 5 vessels per day for a total of 10 passages. A new start of the cruise industry and associated traffic in Venice is unlikely to occur before the end of 2020.
