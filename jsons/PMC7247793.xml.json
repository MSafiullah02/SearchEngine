All patients received anticoagulation according to an institutional protocol based on data suggesting increased venous thromboembolism rates when D-dimer concentrations exceed 3 \u03bcg/mL.2 Five patients with D-dimer concentrations of 3 \u03bcg/mL or higher and known (or highly suspected) thrombosis received therapeutic anticoagulation. Two of the patients received intravenous heparin, and three patients received a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban or bivalirudin) because of heparin resistance or concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Four patients with D-dimer concentrations below 3 \u03bcg/mL received low-dose thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or subcutaneous heparin. Six patients with D-dimer concentrations of 3 \u03bcg/mL or more and without known thrombosis received intermediate dosing (ie, subtherapeutic) of LMWH or intravenous heparin.",
