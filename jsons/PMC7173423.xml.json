Since viruses are intracellular parasites, they rely on their host cells for the energy, macromolecular synthesis machinery and the work benches for genome replication and particle assembly. Because of this dependence, viruses have evolved a myriad of mechanisms for exploiting normal host cell functions. Often this exploitation is associated with damage to the host cell which may be one of the major factors in the pathology and disease caused by viruses. The material in this entry is confined to model systems of virus\u2013host cell interactions that involve the infection by animal viruses of cells in culture.",

Productive infections result in the formation of progeny virus and usually cause the destruction of the host cell. In some cases the host cells are not all destroyed, leading to persistent infections in which the surviving cells multiply and continue to produce progeny viruses. When persistent infections occur in which the viral genome is present but no infectious virus is produced, these infections are referred to as latent infections. In such infections some level of viral gene expression is usually detectable although virions are not produced. When genetic information of the virus is integrated as DNA into the host cell genome or is carried as episomal DNA, transforming infections may take place. Such infections can cause an oncogenic alteration of the growth properties of the cell. Abortive infections occur when viruses infect cells that are nonpermissive or only partially permissive. In this instance, the virus is able to enter the cell but because some step essential for viral replication is absent, the replication cycle does not go to completion and no progeny are produced. Such abortive infections may or may not cause cell death.",

For example, influenza A virus causes a productive, cytolytic infection of a line of canine kidney cells (MDCK). However, when the same virus infects the L cell line of mouse fibroblasts an abortive infection occurs because of a block at the level of virion RNA replication. The same mouse L cell line supports a productive, cytolytic infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). However, if the L cells are pretreated with interferon, the functional state of the cells is altered; the VSV replication cycle is blocked at the level of protein synthesis and an abortive infection results. When VSV infects insect cell lines derived from Aedes or Drosophila, productive noncytolytic infections occur. Continuous passage of the insect cell lines reveals that they have become persistently infected and continuously produce infective virus without any signs of cytopathology.\nAdeno-associated virus (AAV), a parvovirus, is capable of a productive or a latent infection depending upon whether or not the host cells are co-infected with a helper virus such as adenovirus. In some host cells, AAV can cause a latent infection by integrating its DNA into the host cell genome.",

The space available for this entry precludes a comprehensive survey of all the cytopathic effects induced by infection with the various families of animal viruses.

The production of cytopathic effects has been observed with most families of viruses and in many cases the viral gene(s) involved or implicated in these morphological changes has been defined. However, in most cases the mechanisms responsible for cell destruction have not been identified.

Such an inhibition has been seen with VSV and polioviruses. In the case of VSV, both a small viral-encoded RNA molecule (leader RNA) and a viral protein (the matrix M protein) have been implicated in the inhibition of the cellular polymerases at the level of RNA synthesis initiation. Another mechanism to inhibit host RNA synthesis is employed by polioviruses. These agents encode a protease that is capable of cleaving transcription factors required by host RNA polymerases II and III. Reo- and alphaviruses also block host RNA synthesis but the mechanism of this inhibition is not known. Synthesis is not the only level at which viruses can affect host mRNA. Infection with herpes- and poxviruses increases the rate of host mRNA degradation. A unique effect on host cell mRNA is produced by influenza viruses. These agents cleave the cap structure and the first 10\u201313 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 ends of newly synthesized host mRNAs, and utilize this oligomer as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis. Another mechanism that affects host RNA is seen with adenoviruses; in this instance, infection inhibits the transport of host mRNA out of the nucleus.",

Many viruses, such as paramyxo-, papova- and retroviruses do not normally inhibit host protein synthesis during their replication. Furthermore, mutant viruses that are defective in their ability to shut down host protein synthesis are not necessarily defective for virus growth. In fact, VSV mutants selected during a persistent infection have a reduced ability to inhibit the host's translational machinery; nevertheless, these mutants grow to higher titer during a lytic growth cycle than the parental wild-type virus. With several virus families, infection causes a selective inhibition of the translation of host cell mRNA. Such viruses include picorna-, pox-, herpes-, adeno-, rhabdo-, reo- and orthomyxoviruses. In many cases this inhibition is accompanied by a decrease in the overall rate of protein synthesis in the infected cell. It is likely that this overall inhibition occurs at the level of initiation of protein synthesis since, where it has been examined, the average size of the polysomes in the infected cells is reduced.",

It has recently been shown that vaccinia virus, a poxvirus, encodes a small protein which has significant homology to the \u03b1 subunit of eIF-2.

Under conditions that cause increased intracellular sodium ion concentrations, the translation of viral mRNAs may be unimpaired while the translation of host mRNAs is severely reduced. Such a differential effect on virus and host protein synthesis has been reported for cells infected with poliovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, VSV, reovirus and Sindbis virus.

The ability to fuse cells, which is characteristic of the paramyxovirus family, is also seen with herpes-, flavi-, lenti-, pox- and coronaviruses.

            "text": "Cytolytic virus infections generally cause a progressive loss of integrity of the lysosomal membranes. Two phases of damage are recognized. In the first phase, which in some cases is reversible, the lysosomes become permeable to small molecules and are able to concentrate dyes such as neutral red. Visible evidence of this phenomenon is seen with a mutant strain of Newcastle disease virus, a paramyxovirus, which produces red plaques when assayed using an agar overlay containing neutral red. Concentration of this vital stain in lysosomes can also be detected in cells infected with certain strains of influenza A virus. In this instance a ring of darkly staining cells surrounds a clear area of unstained dead cells. In the second phase of lysosomal damage the membrane becomes so permeable that lysosomal enzymes are released into the cytoplasm. As a rule, this release occurs late in the replicative cycle. The release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm has been described for a wide variety of viruses such as picorna-, pox-, herpes-, orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, corona-, adeno- and papovaviruses. The mechanism responsible for this type of virus-induced cytopathology and the role it plays in cell death have not been clearly defined.",

Disruption of one or more of the elements of the cytoskeleton has been described after infection with several viruses. Early gene products of herpes, vaccinia and SV40 viruses produce a disassembly of the actin-containing microfilaments, while infection with polio- and reoviruses causes an alteration and reorganization of the virimentin-containing intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules, another element of the cytoskeleton, are depolymerized following infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), canine distemper virus and frog virus-3. It has been reported that infection with VSV causes a sequential disassembly of all three filament components of the cytoskeleton. The mechanisms by which virus infections disrupt the cytoskeleton are not known and it is not clear whether these morphologic changes are a direct effect of some virus product or a secondary consequence of some other aspect of virus-induced cytopathology. It is interesting to note that in normal cells polyribosomes are closely associated with the cytoskeleton, and on the basis of this association it is possible to speculate that some of the effects of virus infection on the host translational apparatus may be caused by virus-induced changes in the integrity of the cytoskeleton.",

Depending upon the virus, these intracellular masses may consist of either virions or unassembled viral products.

Only one family of RNA viruses, the retroviruses, is capable of transforming cells. This family of viruses induces transformation through the action of a variety of oncogenes that are cellular in origin and that are not part of or necessary to the virus replicative cycle. There are several families of DNA viruses that are the cause of or are associated with tumor induction in animals and cell transformation in cultured cells.

Perhaps the reason it has been so difficult to explain how viruses kill cells is that they do not do this directly. An alternative to a direct cell killing is the induction by viruses of a suicide function in infected cells. It would be advantageous for a cell, as part of a metazoan, to induce an apoptosis-like function in response to viral infection rather than to continue on as a factory producing a constant stream of progeny virus. Some recent evidence has appeared that lends support to this possibility. The cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with apoptosis; and in another report, a noncytopathic latent infection of B cells with Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with an inhibition of the apoptosis function. In this connection, it is interesting to note that latent infection with EBV blocks the killing of B cells by VSV with little or no effect on the replicative ability of this RNA virus. These observations provide some basis for suggesting that virus-associated cell killing may involve the induction of apoptosis or some other suicide function in the infected cell.",

In many cases, cells are resistant to infection by a particular virus simply because of the lack of appropriate surface receptors. A dramatic example of this type of resistance is seen when chicken fibroblast cells, which lack specific receptor molecules on their plasma membranes, are exposed to poliovirus. Infection does not take place because the viruses cannot adsorb to the cell membrane. However, the avian cells are fully able to support the growth of poliovirus if transfected with the virion RNA rather than infected with intact virions. In addition to cell surface viral receptors, the host range of some viruses can be determined by other factors such as host cell transcriptional regulators.

Two of these proteins, the 2\u2032-5\u2032 A synthetase and the protein kinase, have been well characterized and evidence has accumulated that demonstrates their role in the development of the interferon-mediated antiviral state.
