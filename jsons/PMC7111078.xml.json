Focusing on innovation excellence prevents evolution stagnation. Regardless of the individual\u2019s role on the perioperative team (eg, RN circulator, scrub person, anesthesia personnel, surgeon, or personnel from materials management, laboratory, radiology, housekeeping, administration), each person assumes a lead role at various times and contributes to the success of the team for the patient.",

            "text": "Sports analogies illustrate similar team approaches to understanding leadership. For example, if my role in a baseball organization is to collect the bat immediately after the player's at-bats, I am contributing to the health of the team by preventing injury from tripping over a bat left in the running path. If my role is right fielder and it is the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs and my team is in the lead, one out will win the game: the pitcher throws the ball, the batter hits a fly ball to right field, and as right fielder, the burden of responsibility is mine. The fans (ie, family members or designated support person[s]) hold their breath, and my teammates (ie, OR team members) move in to support my personal action. After I catch the ball, there is a collective sigh of relief from the fans, high fives all around, and joy for the win. If I do not catch the ball, there is immediate action by my team members to overcome my catching error and help rectify the issue with me. Although dejected, the fans are hopeful because the game is not over, the opposing player (ie, the disease) made it on base but has not scored. Hope is what endears innovation during times of challenge. Challenges can cause action and occasionally adaptation,2 and becoming overwhelmed by the challenge creates immobility and results in the stagnation2 of progress.",

The preceding baseball analogy is similar to that of the perioperative nurse caring for the patient in the OR setting. In some situations, the responsibility for care outcome actions rests solely with the RN circulator (ie, the right fielder); in other situations, the contributions of each member of the health care team are the foundation for continuing to offer hope to the patient and family (ie, the fans). Taking responsibility for our own mistakes, seeking options for improvement, and picking up the pieces, even when faced with one\u2019s own fallibility, are keys to transformative leadership. When the team helps an individual member who has made a mistake to refocus his or her attention on the end goal (ie, re-establishing the optimal health of the patient) instead of on the error, that helps brings the team member \u201cback in the game\u201d with a desire to contribute even more for the patient.\u201cBy looking at potential future accomplishments as if we have already achieved them, we set goals by envisioning the outcomes clearly.\u201d\n",
