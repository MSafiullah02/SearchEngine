            "text": "\n\u2022Tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients for thoracic surgery is a high-risk procedure for the anesthesia team because of the risks of aerosol transmission of the infection during placement of the airway device and check bronchoscopy. It is also a risk for the patients with severe COVID-19 who would not tolerate long periods of apnea or inadequate oxygenation in case of delayed or failed tracheal intubation.\u2022The procedure should be \u201cS\u201dafe (for staff and patient), \u201cA\u201dccurate (avoiding unreliable, unfamiliar or repeated techniques) AND \u201cS\u201dwift (timely, without rush and delay). (Mnemonic: SAS).4\n\u2022As asymptomatic patients may also have the viral infection during the pandemic, and false negative tests cannot be excluded with certainty, it is prudent that the team takes a cautious approach and considers every patient undergoing surgery as potentially positive for infection. These considerations require specific protective measures, sophisticated organization and team practices.\u2022An elective procedure should be preferred if possible, as emergency intubation may compromise protective procedures and could also increase the patient's risk.\u2022Ideally, the location of intubation should be an \u201cisolated\u201d negative pressure room with >12 air changes/minute. There are hoewever few operating rooms (OR) with negative pressure facilities which are more commonly available in intensive care units. If a negative pressure OR is not available:\u2013The level of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) should be increased (e.g. mask/respirator type and face shield or helmet.\u2013Alternatively, intubation can be performed in a negative pressure room followed by transfer to the OR, such as in isolated ward or intensive care unit (ICU). The benefits of such an approach however need to be judged against its disadvantages and possible complications.\u2013In rooms with positive pressure, the room can be put under the least possible positive pressure and the rest of the unit under higher positive pressure, and the doors should be kept closed, so that the high exchange rate of air in operating theatres limits dispersion of aerosols outside the theatre, despite the positive pressure.\n\u2022Medical staff involved in tracheal intubation should be limited to those with essential roles. Due to the high risk of infection, we suggest that members of the intubating team should not include practitioners with significant vulnerability such as older age (> 60yrs), immunosuppressed, pregnant or having serious chronic co-morbidities.\u2013Inside the room, there must be two attendants in the \u201cred zone\u201d: Intubation should be performed by the most experienced physician to minimize delay or related complications; a second doctor should help to administer drugs and monitor the patient be available in case of unanticipated difficulty. The authors want to note that many other societies suggest three attendants (with full donning) in the red zone; however, in this period of the pandemic, this criterion is probably not possible to achieve.\u2013There must a \u201crunner\u201d physician available directly outside the room in \u201cyellow zone\u201d with full donned personal protection equipment (PPE), in case of need for help.\u2013Outside the dedicated OR \u201cwhite zone\u201d, there must be also be an observer to monitor the \u201cdonning/doffing\u201d process of the PPE.\u2013The surgical, anesthesia, nursing and paramedical staff who are not involved with airway management should not enter the operating theatre until after the airway has been secured.\n\u2022Several levels of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) have been defined for different procedures by different societies. Intubation and bronchoscopy are among the \u201caerosol-generating\u201d procedures and are associated with increased infection risk. During intubation in thoracic anesthesia, it is suggested to work with so-called \u201cAir borne level\u201d precautions, which include the following components of appropriate PPE:\u2022Hair covers/hoods.\u2022Fitted filtering facepiece (FFP)3 / N95 / FFP2 masks.\u2022Goggles or face shield.\u2022Long sleeve fluid-resistant gown.\u2022Double gloves.\u2022Overshoes.\n\u2022Maintaining the sequence for donning and doffing PPE (Table 2\n) is very important to avoid any contagion. This process can be challenging especially for attendants with less experience, and therefore requires thorough training, practice and constant monitoring during the actual procedures by an external observer.\n",

Before opening the valve of the swivel and introducing the bronchoscope, the anesthesia ventilator should be paused. If saturation is critical, preoxygenation can be performed in advance. During bronchoscopy, ventilation may be resumed, but it is important to ensure that the valve of the swivel fits snuggly enough such that there is no leakage. Otherwise bronchoscopy should be performed during apnea. The same procedure should be carried out when the bronchoscope is withdrawn from the tube. Other openings of the airway, e.g. suctioning, should also be performed under apnea.\u2013If a BB is to be used, the trachea of the patient is intubated with a standard ETT: A 7.5-8.0 mm ID (females) or 8.0-9.0 mm ID (males) ETT with a subglottic suction port should be chosen. It is a general rule to choose the largest possible ETT for intubation in order to allow enough room for the insertion of both the bronchial blocker and the fiberoptic bronchoscope. These ETT's diameters are convenient for this approach. As the confirmation of the position of the tube may be difficult while wearing PPE, the cuff should be passed 1-2 cm below the cords to avoid bronchial placement.\u2013Tracheal intubation should be confirmed with continuous waveform capnography.\u2013In cases intubated with ETT and BB, the position of the BB (and the tube) should be confirmed with a disposable flexible bronchoscope or an ETT with an embedded camera.\n\n",

Regional anesthesia would leave the airway open to the room for the duration of the procedure with risks of contagion. There is no supporting evidence or previous reports describing the non-intubated technique in patients with highly contagious diseases. Even in the \u201chealthy\u201d (non Covid-19) population, non-intubated thoracic surgery is a novel, less well described approach, which contrary to some beliefs, is more challenging for the anesthetist. Under the new condition with the SARS-CoV2, there may be some exceptional cases that would benefit from this approach, but overall, it should be considered as too heroic, and cannot be recommended.",

This would avoid (or decrease) the risk of aerosolization through the disconnected lumen (Figure 4\n).\u2022As the oxygenation of SARS-CoV2 patients is already compromised, one-lung ventilation could be more challenging, and a higher incidence of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation can be expected.\u2022Generic recommendation for the conduct of one-lung ventilation (OLV) can also be considered to be also valid in these patients:\u25cbFiO2 of 100 %.\u25cbLow tidal volume 4-6 ml/kg predicted body weight.\u25cbSome degree of hypercapnia can be permitted by adjusting the respiratory frequency (pH above 7.2).\u25cbPotentially a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be required than in a patient without COVID-19: appr 13-15 cm H2O. A PEEP titration strategy is suggested but should be performed very cautiously not to cause a decrease in cardiac output in higher PEEP levels.\u25cbIt is an advantage that lung compliance is usually good in SARS-CoV2 patients (as reported by the Italian group).\u25cbPatients may get benefit from the application of an alveolar recruitment maneuver, and a trial is recommended. It should be kept in mind however that the recruitment strategy can impair the hemodynamic stability in a more extended way than the \u201chealthy\u201d patients.\u2022Clearly in some patients with active lung disease, maintenance of OLV may be impossible due to oxygenation problems. In such cases it should be kept in mind that in cases without obligatory indications for a lung \u201cisolation\u201d (e.g. airway leakage, unilateral bleeding), the price to continue the OLV must never be to compromise oxygenation. This general rule must be even more strictly adhered to in challenging cases like SARS-CoV2 patients.\u2022In open thoracotomies, application of CPAP to the non-dependent lung can be very useful to prevent hypoxemia. The authors suggest that the benefits to achieve sufficient oxygenation would overcome the (unproven) possibility of aerosolization from the open CPAP system.\u2022In some cases, application of extracorporeal assist systems (for oxygenation and/or carbon dioxide removal) can be indicated. But these cases are beyond the scope of this review.\n",

Now, only the bronchial cuff can be inflated; and ventilation can be continued only via the bronchial lumen.\u2022It has been reported that the patients with SARS-CoV2 usually have excessive retained secretions, especially during the weaning phase. It therefore makes sense to postpone this phase to a later time frame than the immediate postoperative period.\u2022In patients who are to be extubated:\u25cbPrior to extubation, aspiration via a closed system, followed by a recruitment maneuver is suggested.\u25cbPatient should be ready for extubation on to facemask. Air flow to surrounding area should be avoided as much as possible. A tight-fitting facemask is therefore essential.\u25cbAgain, aerosolizing procedures (e.g. none-invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)) should be avoided.\u25cbRegarding PPE, the same level, conditions and logistics, as applied during intubation are required.\u25cbAny maneuver which risks precipitating coughing should be avoided: oral suctioning (if any) should be very gentle, patients should not be asked to cough. In difficult airway cases, using an extubation catheter (e.g. with a soft thin tip) can be possible, but in these cases, keeping the patient intubated is more rational.\u25cbUse of medication known to effectively lower the incidence of coughing (e.g. dexmedetomidine)\u25cbPlacing a N95 or surgical face mask on the patient after extubation, with an oxygen mask immediately above could be feasible not only to prevent postoperative hypoxemia, but also to minimize aerosolization.\u25cbTransferring extubated patients should follow local regulations.\n",
