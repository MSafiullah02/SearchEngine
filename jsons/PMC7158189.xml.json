Queens undergo estrous cycles repeatedly during a breeding season unless interrupted by pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, or illness. Estrous cycles will occur at variable intervals but most typically every 14 to 21 days. Cats housed indoors, but largely under the influence of seasonal light, will cycle according to the season. The mechanism of photoperiod influence on estrous cycles through the hypothalamic-hypophysial-gonadal axis and the hormone melatonin has been partly elucidated in the cat. A shorter duration of photoperiod is associated with increased concentrations of melatonin and prolactin and reduction in ovarian activity.",

This part of the estrous cycle may last only one day or so, and the signs may be subtle; so, it is often not detected. In proestrus, many queens rub their head and neck against convenient objects and display affectionate behavior. Occasionally, queens in proestrus have a slight mucoid vulvar discharge and pollakiuria.

            "text": "Ovulation occurs 48 hours or more following the LH surge.95 All oocytes are released at the same time. The remaining granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles undergo luteinization and begin to produce progesterone almost immediately. Progesterone concentrations rise within 24 hours, and may reach highs of 60 to 90 ng/mL (190.8 to 286.2 nmol/L) by 15 to 25 days post-ovulation.113 Peak progesterone concentrations are highly variable from queen to queen. Throughout pregnancy, progesterone is maintained at high concentrations until the last few days of gestation, when the level falls to about 2 ng/mL (6.4 nmol/L) and to less than 1 ng/mL (3.2 nmol/L) immediately following parturition.113 A minimum progesterone concentration of 1 ng/mL (3.2 nmol/L) appears to be necessary to sustain pregnancy in the queen.109 Although progesterone declines at term, baseline concentrations are not required for onset of parturition in the queen, as in the bitch.55 Progesterone test kits designed for ovulation timing in the bitch have been validated for use in the queen.6\n",

Benzodiazepine tranquilizers, such as alprazolam, may be used in moderate doses but some adverse effects of these drugs (e.g., paradoxical aggression, ataxia) may be unpredictable and undesirable. Buspirone hydrochloride has some short-term antiaggressive and anxiolytic effects, but it probably affects secretion of pituitary hormones. If the queen's temperament is undesirable, she may not be a good candidate for a breeding program.",

However, ovulation and pregnancy rates quoted in the literature are derived from random-bred or colony-bred cats and may not always be achieved with pedigreed cats. This is especially true of the Persian and related breeds that appear to have reduced fertility. Simply housing queen and tom cat together for the duration of the queen's estrus can also result in pregnancy, but it may deplete sperm reserves in tom cats that are frequently used for breeding.",

Pharmacologic options for induction of ovulation during estrus include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (250 IU/cat, IM) and gonadotropin releasing hormone (Cystorelin, Merial [Duluth, Ga.]; 25 \u00b5g/cat, IM).57 Induction of ovulation will not shorten the length of that estrus period, however.

Intact queens should be spayed, and a flank approach is most appropriate (Figure 40-3\n). If the cat is being treated with progestins, treatment should be stopped. The drug of choice for treatment of MH is the progesterone receptor blocker aglepristone (Alizine, Virbac; 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, SC, days 1, 2, and 7).33, 78 One long-term study monitored 14 queens with MH for 12 months following treatment with aglepristone.58 Remission of clinical signs occurred in an average of 4 weeks.

LH stimulates ovulation and luteinization of mature ovarian follicles. In intact queens, serum LH is maintained at basal levels through the negative feedback provided by ovarian estradiol secretion.

Failure to remove the ipsilateral ovary is likely to result in ovarian remnant syndrome and necessitate an exploratory laparotomy at a later date.When one normal uterine horn and ovary are present, the queen may have normal estrous cycles and may even become pregnant. However, segmental aplasia may cause failure to conceive associated with fluid accumulation in the uterine lumen, depending on the location of the occlusion.70, 73\n",

Strong, visible uterine contractions deliver each kitten from its uterine horn, into the uterine body and through the cervix and vagina. The queen can be seen bearing down, but crying out is uncommon. Both head first (two thirds of births) and hindquarters first (one third of births) presentations are normal in the cat. Presentation of the tail and rump before the hind legs is a more difficult delivery.",

If a uterine or ovarian blood vessel ruptures, life-threatening hemorrhagic shock may occur. The queen is stabilized with intravenous fluids before the prolapse is treated. If significant hemorrhage has occurred, a blood transfusion is necessary. Systemic antibiotics are administered if the prolapsed tissue is necrotic. General anesthesia is induced, and if the uterus is in good condition, it is cleaned and manually replaced. Oxytocin is used to promote involution. An ovariohysterectomy can be performed if no further breeding is planned or the uterus is compromised.

Common causes include breeding too early or too late in estrus, unsuccessful intromission, and too few copulations. If problems with breeding management have been ruled out, hormonal induction of ovulation in queens in estrus may be attempted with GnRH or hCG (see Table 40-1), followed by natural breeding.64 Treatment is most likely to be successful if given when mature ovarian follicles are present. These drugs should be used with caution; excessive use of hCG has been associated with ovarian hyperstimulation and formation of antigonadotropin antibodies.100 Administration of hCG more frequently than every 6 months is not recommended.",

Progesterone induces hyperplasia of the surface or glandular epithelium and cystic dilatation of the uterine glands.85 Proliferation of the endometrial glands produces a wavy, coil-shaped appearance of the uterine lumen that may be seen with hysterography or ultrasonography.9 Fluid present in cystic structures or in the uterine lumen readily supports bacterial growth. Progesterone also inhibits local leukocyte responses and decreases myometrial contractility, which increases the risk of ascending bacterial infection.14, 98 Bacteria are not normally found in the uterus, except in a small number of queens during estrus.11 Endometrial hyperplasia may also be influenced by chronic estrogenic stimulation from recurrent estrous cycles that do not result in pregnancy.85 In addition, estrogens increase progesterone receptors in the endometrium and dilate the cervix.2, 8\n",
