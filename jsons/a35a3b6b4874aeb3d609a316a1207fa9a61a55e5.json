We have paid particular attention to respiratory viruses that wreak heavy morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinically significant ones include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and influenza virus. As the infection by these viruses is clinically restricted to the respiratory tissues, mainly the lungs, the logical route for the application of the siRNA was also the same, i.e., via the nasal route. Following the initial success of intranasal siRNA against RSV, second-generation siRNAs were made against the viral polymerase large subunit (L) that were chemically modified and screened for improved stability, activity and pharmacokinetics. 2 \u2032 -Omethyl (2 \u2032 -O -Me) and 2 \u2032 -deoxy-2 \u2032 -fluoro (2 \u2032 -F) substitutions in the ribose ring were incorporated in different positions of the sense and antisense strands and the resultant siRNAs were tested with various transfection reagents intranasally against RSV. Based on these results, we propose the following consensus for designing intranasal antiviral siRNAs: (i) modified 19-27 nt long double-stranded siRNAs are functional in the lung, (ii) excessive 2 \u2032 -OMe and 2 \u2032 -F modifications in either or both strands of these siRNAs reduce efficacy, and (iii) limited modifications in the sense strand are beneficial, although their precise efficacy may be position-dependent.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The \"first-generation\" siRNAs were designed to mimic the products of the Dicer endonuclease cleavage; they were 19-nt long duplexes with 3 \u2032 -terminal 2-nt overhangs and contained natural, unmodified ribose and bases.

In this study, synthetic unmodified siRNAs, designed against essential viral genes, prevented RSV growth in cultured lung epithelial cells (3) . To translate this success to the animal model (4) , we reasoned that the most logical route for delivery of these siRNAs should be the nose (intranasal). First, it is noninvasive. Second, it should involve relatively simple application procedures, such as nasal drops or aerosol inhalation. Third, the siRNA drug will follow the same route as the virus and reach the same tissues, including the lungs. Lastly, our subsequent results showed that the intranasally administered siRNA remains in the lung and does not leach into blood or other tissues, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects (data not shown). In this chapter, we have, therefore, focused on the intranasal delivery of anti-respiratory viral siRNAs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "331"}, {"text": "We will first summarize the progress made in four major respiratory viruses: RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (Flu), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4, 5, (8) (9) (10) . The first three viruses are clinically the most significant, claiming a large number of human lives each year throughout the world. Annual flu epidemics alone affect 10-20% of the U.S. population, averaging about 114,000 hospitalizations. Partly due to the high mutation rate of RNA genomes, there is no definitive vaccine or reliable antiviral treatment for these viruses. Ribavirin and IFN, although sometimes used, are both relatively non-specific and toxic (11) . Regarding the molecular feature of their genomes, RSV and PIV are nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, belonging to different genera of the Paramyxoviridae family (5) . Flu is an orthomyxovirus and contains segmented negative-strand RNA genome (8, 9) . Coronoviruses such as SARS-CoV contain positive-strand, enveloped RNA genomes (10) . A commonality among these RNA viruses is that they encode genes for RNAdependent polymerase (RdRP) to transcribe and replicate their genomes, because the host animal cells are devoid of such activity. Many of the potent antiviral siRNAs have, therefore, targeted viral genes coding for RdRP subunits or related to RdRP function (3, 4, 5, (8) (9) (10) . They include, e.g., P (Phosphoprotein) (3, 4) , L (Large) (see Table 16 .1 ), and N (Nucleocapsid) genes of RSV; P and L genes of PIV; PA and N genes of Flu; and the replicase gene of SARS-CoV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 203, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 204, "end": 206, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 207, "end": 210, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 683, "end": 687, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 943, "end": 945, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1364, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1367, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1370, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1374, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1378, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1383, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1431, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1449, "end": 1457, "text": "Table 16", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "331"}, {"text": "In all cases, siRNAs were designed against essential viral gene(s), optimized in cell culture and then used intranasally in the appropriate animal model.

The latter modification is placed on pyrimidine nucleosides (C, U), leading to 2 \u2032 -FC and 2 \u2032 -FU residues. In a number of previous studies (12 -15) , these substitutions were introduced to various extents in the antisense strand (\"guide\" strand) or both strands of the siRNA and were shown to enhance stability and potency, although intranasal application was not tested. Additionally, they tend to reduce siRNAdriven innate immune response (16, 17) . In systematic studies in cell culture, the biochemical and functional activity of the siRNA was vindicated but found to be affected by the position of the modifications in the sequence (12 -15) . Generally speaking, those with the modified ribonucleotides at the 5 \u2032 -end of the antisense strand were less active relative to the 3 \u2032 -modified ones. Internally, while 2 \u2032 -F was generally well-tolerated on the antisense strand, 2 \u2032 -O -Me showed significant shift in activity depending on the position. In contrast, incorporation of 2 \u2032 -O -Me in the sense strand of siRNA did not show a strong positional preference.

When these siRNAs were additionally Cy3labeled, it revealed their accumulation in the liver and spleen, but not in the lung, explaining the success of the i.v. administration against hepatitis while suggesting that it is an ineffective route against lung infections. Based on the absence of a uniform pattern in these studies, we reasoned that substituted second-generation siRNAs against respiratory viruses should be individually optimized through the following steps: (i) Design the first-generation siRNA following the generally accepted sequence rules, (ii) select the ones with lowest IC 50 (preferably below ~20 nM) in a cell culture assay for virus growth, (iii) add OMe and F substitutions in various \"format\" (i.e., number and placement), (iv) ensure that the substitutions either improved or did not reduce knockdown efficiency by screening in cell culture, (v) confirm efficacy and lack of toxicity in animal model, and (vi) test improved stability in serum and blood in vitro.
