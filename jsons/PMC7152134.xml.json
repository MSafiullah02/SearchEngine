Kearney's Confidence Index,1\nChina maintained its position as the most attractive destination of FDI every year between 2004 and 2012 and ranked as the second popular destination of FDI since 2013 (behind the United States). As mentioned in the previous chapter, owing to the supportive policy environment, export-oriented FDI as an important source of private capital has been, to a great extent, contributing to the growth of Chinese manufacturing. A large number of FDI projects built production hubs for export, helping increase employment of migrant workers and poverty reduction in coastal cities in China.",

The real engine enabling China to be the global export powerhouse is attributed to a wide range of FDI into this country (Lau & Bruton, 2008). The increasing inflow of FDI is responsible for the majority of China's exports (Wielemaker & Gedajlovic, 2011), promoting its annual GDP and enabling it to become the world's second largest economy in 2010. In terms of the industrial distribution of FDI, about 50% of FDI went into manufacturing sectors since the 1990s, particularly into OEM (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2012). Following the emergence of GVCs (Gereffi et al., 2005), these foreign-invested OEMs capitalized on China's abundant supply of low-wage labour to manufacture products for developed-country buyers.",

The low-cost advantages of FDI OEMs are disappearing and exports may not be sufficient for these firms to remain financially successful in the future. The literature shows that the most feasible strategy to enhance economic returns for OEMs is the conduct of functional upgrading: a process to move upwards along the GVCs from OEM to original design manufacture (ODM) and eventually to OBM (Gereffi et al., 2005; Morrison, Pietrobelli, & Rabellotti, 2008). If well-implemented, functional upgrading enables OEM firms to overcome the unequal distribution of profits by engaging in more value-added activities (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004).",

However, the Chinese mass market demonstrates remarkable heterogeneity and is expected to morph into differentiated and multitiered segments over the next 10 years. China's domestic market is actually a conglomeration of separate regional markets protected by provincial barriers and segmented by a variety of economic and industrial factors (Tse, 2010). Therefore, this multimarket conception inevitably raises problems for foreign investors to compete in China's huge but disordered domestic market. As far as the FDI OEMs go, the prominent question is: what are the specific capabilities these OEMs require for changing to adapt to the dynamic Chinese market and uncertainties?",

Hence, we first identify the specific dynamic capabilities and leadership style involved in the upgrading trajectory by FDI OEMs to build a conceptual framework. Then we employ a multiple-case study with a pattern-matching analysis investigating two Singapore-invested OEMs to examine the assumed model. This study makes three unique contributions. First, it presents the evolutionary upgrading strategies of FDI OEMs in China in the face of the new global economy. Further, conducting in-depth interviews with top management in both parent companies in Singapore and their subsidiaries in China, this research responds to a recent call for collecting first-hand timely data to investigate FDI issues in EEs (Lau & Bruton, 2008). Finally, the results offer fresh and critical insights into the practical implications for FDI OEMs to grow and prosper in the Chinese market.",

This phenomenon is characterized by the concept of the GVC (Gereffi et al., 2005; Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004; Morrison et al., 2008). Drawing on the GVC system to coordinate global production and distribution, DE exporters are able to manufacture products based on designs supplied by international buyers or just produce small parts of final products. This GVC approach has provided a primary path for Chinese manufacturers to initiate international businesses via offering OEM services to large MNCs and foreign buyers since the reform and opening-up policy over 30 years ago (Li, Wei, et al., 2010; Lin & Hou, 2010). The GVC view reveals not only a holistic map of the global production network and market, but also a comprehensive and integrated approach explaining industrial development and innovation in emerging countries (Morrison et al., 2008). To exploit the opportunities presented by GVCs and meanwhile tackle competitive global markets, firms need to innovate or upgrade their capacities for performance (Kaplinsky et al., 2009).",

Echoing this, an increasing number of OEM manufacturers have augmented per-unit value of products by carrying out functional upgrading to shift their business functions from competing on low cost production to competing on innovation pertaining to design and marketing activities in GVCs. It is because functional upgrading changes the mix of activities within and between links in the GVC that can be used as an effective means to transform production organizations to design, marketing, and branding corporations. More specifically, research highlights the hierarchy mechanism of functional upgrading in which developing country firms transform from original equipment assembling under contract to global buyers to OEM (producing goods under a buyer's name), to ODM (involving design activities), to OBM (producing own brand products and participating in marketing activities) (Gereffi et al., 2005; Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004).",

In general, these firms began with OEM, gradually adding postconceptual design services to the manufacturing function, or ODM. After being armed with design capabilities, they then started to manufacture finished products and marketed them under their own brands\u2014this is OBM. As indicated by Matthews (2006), a few Chinese OEMs may start from behind in terms of international arenas, but then overcome deficiencies to become global giants, namely the \u2018Dragon Multinationals\u2019. Despite the successful precedents, some large manufacturers in China may still choose to continuously provide OEM services to overseas clients after upgrading to OBM as mature market buyers are usually profitable and reliable clients. However, meanwhile these firms may also produce own brand products specifically for their local markets (i.e. the Chinese market).",

Capabilities are scarce, appropriable, and specialized and are strategic assets that bestow the firm's competitive advantage. Capabilities cannot be bought; rather, they must be built and may only be developed over a long period of time (Malik & Kotabe, 2009). In terms of an organization, the internal capabilities, combined with external partnerships, are seen as a flexible innovation system (Su, Peng, Shen, & Xiao, 2012).",

Dynamic capabilities thus reflect a firm's ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage, reconfiguring its capabilities according to its environmental changes (Malik & Kotabe, 2009; Su et al., 2012; Teece et al., 1997). However, how is one to distinguish a dynamic capability from a mere capability? An organizational capability refers to the set of activities performed by the firm which produces outputs that determine its survival and prosperity within its current strategic setting; such outputs will not change the strategic direction of the firm (Sun & Anderson, 2010). In contrast, an organization's dynamic capability should reflect its ability to build new and unique capabilities that help identify new opportunities under turbulent conditions and make strategic responses to situational changes more quickly (Weerawardena, Sullivan Mort, Liesch, & Knight, 2007). In other words, a strategic set of dynamic capabilities does not accrue from the firm, but is built consciously and systematically by the leader's wilful decision-making and actions. Following this logic, scholars argue that corporate profitability may not be sustained by the control over the market (e.g. by using quasimonopolistic practices), but rather by the development of dynamic capabilities to adapt to changing external networks and global situations (Kaplinsky et al., 2009). Viewed from this angle, the dynamic capabilities theory is indeed closely related to the concept of the GVC analytical framework.",

Functional upgrading is the sequence of acquisitions of internal functional capabilities, while the two critical success factors for upgrading within the GVCs are: (1) the acquisition of key functional capabilities, and (2) better exploiting the acquired capabilities to access not only general markets but also particular market channels (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004). Both acquisitions and access are dynamic in nature because a shift towards an upper specification/function represents a shift in strategic direction. Following this logic, functional upgrading can be seen as a competitive and innovative strategy that requires OEMs to develop bundles of capabilities that help them to overcome the barriers and difficulties in crossing different functions and ultimately increasing economic performance. Taken together, we assume that to ensure successful functional upgrading, firms must possess certain dynamic capabilities that help them react agilely to the uncertainties and complexities in today's world.",

Technological capabilities are not easy to develop or even to imitate because they are embedded in a firm's operation and, to a certain extent, influence its internal mechanisms (Barney, 1991). Extensive empirical results show that firms with higher levels of technological capability are more likely to compete in hyper-competitive international markets (Zou, Chen, & Ghauri, 2010). By providing manufacturing and assembly services to advanced economy MNCs, OEMs get abundant learning opportunities for acquiring advanced technical and R&D skills to build technological capabilities, including up-to-date technology and the unique capacity to appropriate, adapt, and transform secondary technology (Liu et al., 2009). This reflects the prominent dynamic characteristic in terms of building technological capabilities as the development of such capacity has to cater to the latest need of fast-changing global markets. It is true that, owing to the technology spillover effects within GVCs, some aspirant OEM firms have gradually become proficient in the use of high-tech knowledge after collaborating with global brands for a certain period of time\u2014by which they could further evolve from the bottom of GVCs to be the competitors against their developed-country outsourcers (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004; Mudambi, 2007).",

Leadership is especially important for functional upgrading because upgrading is a high-risk endeavour and there is no guarantee of success. Top managers must have foresight to see the benefits, courage to take the risk, and forbearance and determination to carry through the process. In addition, as described earlier, the achievement of functional upgrading requires OEMs to intensify cross-organizational learning from their international partners for establishing necessary dynamic capabilities. However, owing to the asymmetry of power between buyers and vendors, buyers may not always be willing to provide support for their suppliers\u2019 upgrading (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2004; Mudambi, 2007). In this vein, effective leadership (see Rowley & Ulrich, 2014 for an overview) activities that influence a group of individuals to move towards a common goal play a critical role in driving and propelling the whole organization to accomplish functional upgrading.",

For instance, participants were requested to try their best to provide evidence objectively. The semistructured interviews with open-ended questions in both Chinese and English versions were conducted by at least a three-person team, with one researcher handling the interview questions with the other two recording notes and observations. For the information items that required exploring at length and in depth, the interviewer would ask more follow-up questions. Interviews were tape-recorded at the same time to avoid omitting information and enhance corroborating evidence. To verify the reliability and validity of interviews, the recorded data were processed on the same day they were taped. Also, to resolve inconsistency, researchers listened to the records and returned to the interviewees repeatedly until consensus was reached. If needed, further follow-up telephone interviews would be conducted. Since both firms are listed companies, a wide range of archival records, such as their annual reports and other public statements, were used as supplements. Finally, information and data collected from diverse sources were cross-checked to ensure accuracy and reliability.",

Evidence reveals that creating own brands is likely to cause animosity from main buyers and GVC leaders towards their OEM suppliers (Morrison et al., 2008) because OEMs may leapfrog them to compete against their initial outsourcers in international arenas after developing sufficient capabilities (Matthews, 2006). Despite this, a large number of Chinese manufacturers still view OEM partnerships with global brands as a springboard to learn about creating own brands (Chin et al., 2016; Chin, Tsai, et al., 2016). In contrast, Singapore-invested firms seem inclined to regard OEM collaboration as a long-term stable strategy to secure growth and profits by establishing trust relationships with world-class brands. As such, Singapore OEMs usually endeavour to upgrade to ODM status, but hesitate to proceed to upgrade to OBM status. In this vein, Singapore-invested OEMs in China reflect an idiosyncrasy to establish thicker linkages and dense interactions with GVC partners rather than to build own brands. Following this logic, it is plausible to claim that both foreign-invested and domestic OEMs in China may view the outsourcing trends concerning functional upgrading along the GVC differently.",

First, in terms of research methodology, a two-case study may not be able to offer sufficient evidence to examine our assumed model. Second, in addition to the three organizational capabilities identified, there may be others; future research could try to identify more vital and relevant capabilities that affect functional upgrading. Third, scholars should pay attention to discussing the mechanisms and interactions among different organizational capabilities, as well as the importance weights and synergy of individual capabilities. By doing so, the path of functional upgrading can be articulated in a more systematic and extensive manner. On the basis of the foregoing arguments, it is also recommended that future research could conduct a comparative study including firms that did not engage in functional upgrading\u2014which may reveal a more comprehensive picture of FDIs and their upgrading strategies in China.",

Owing to poor intellectual rights protection and weak legal enforcement coupled with the very complex bureaucratic systems in EEs, global start-up firms with less resources deciding to venture into EEs may face more intricate problems than those internationalizing their business in other developed economies (DEs) with more sound market infrastructures. However, in recent years, there have been an increasing number of entrepreneurial firms from DEs that prefer to enter large EEs such as China at an early stage given the large populations and attractive consumer markets (Jones et al., 2011; Kiss et al., 2012). While the literature still tends to explain how large enterprises from DEs compete in EEs (Lyles & Park, 2013; Yamakawa, Khavul, & Peng, 2013), there has been a scarcity of literature demonstrating why some DE global start-up firms choose to venture into EEs with higher uncertainty instead of into other mature markets with more familiarity.",

As such, our study employs a case-study approach, investigating how a British OEM accelerated its internationalization process by setting up a plant in China.

Such firms may adopt higher and more aggressive modes of foreign market entry, such as building wholly-owned subsidiaries at their inception. In contrast, Johanson and Vahlne (1977) emphasize \u2018bounded rationality\u2019, which suggests that firms learn experientially and measure risks cautiously in internationalization. Firms should, in general, accumulate knowledge to increase their commitments in foreign markets step by step. In other words, the learning trajectories for internationalization by global start-ups and established firms may be varied\u2014which highlights the pivotal role of international entrepreneurship in determining the timing, scope, and scale of internationalizing firms. This raises various issues for researchers to explore. After all, while the background, experience, and personal characteristics of entrepreneurs are of great importance to firms\u2019 international entrepreneurial behaviour (Chin, Tsai, et al., 2016; Kiss et al., 2012), it is imperative to investigate the links between global start-ups\u2019 learning and their entrepreneurial activities and how the links contribute to firms\u2019 competitive advantages. It is also worth further study whether the learning form and content of global start-ups will change as they reach the mature stage of development in host countries.",

As illustrated in the previous section, China had been attracting the world's largest amount of FDI into its OEM industry. Such DE global start-up OEMs, unlike the mainstream model of DE global start-ups emerging from high-tech industries, are mostly labour-intensive rather than technology-intensive because these firms used to exploit the abundant supply of cheap labour in China to compete. Compared with domestic OEMs in China, DE global start-up OEMs often have a relatively broader knowledge base in international marketing and modern technology, despite the weakness of local market knowledge and social networks (Chin & Liu, 2017; Chin et al., 2015). Following this logic, the DE global start-up OEMs in China still possess certain comparative advantages against domestic OEMs when competing in the export and international arenas.",

More specifically, since Chris was the main decision-maker, the decision-making process on TECHSAVVY's side was quick, smooth, and efficient. In contrast, making decisions seemed to be very time-consuming and complex at CMM. Even worse, conclusions agreed on by both sides at meetings could be overthrown later if a higher level boss of CMM disliked it. Chris felt very confused why the laborious work of preparing the negotiation with CMM always fell through.2.Different opinions on product safety and quality requirements\n",

In contrast, CMM thought that strictly conforming to international standards would include redundant and costly functions that might result in excessive pricing beyond the affordable range in the Chinese market. So they suggested following Chinese standards, as China was the major market.3.Disputes on pricing strategies\n",

            "text": "The different points of view on product specification, as mentioned above, raised further disputes on formulating pricing strategies for the products. CMM, favouring low-price strategies, attempted to position the products as a cost leader in both Chinese and overseas markets, while TECHSAVVY preferred to use \u2018Western design and quality at a relatively lower price\u2019 as the market positioning and thus to differentiate the products in many ways, such as adding hi-tech features and improving display functions. For example, in 2012 TECHSAVVY had followed international standards in designing a MGD model with built-in Wi-Fi, backup battery, and a sensor to measure the densities of methane and carbon dioxide gas in mines. However, CMM used to benefit from cost leading strategy, insisting that the extras of built-in Wi-Fi, backup battery and carbon dioxide gas detector appeared dispensable, as those were not standard equipment for MGD. Hence, CMM suggested to TECHSAVVY to remove them in order to reduce the manufacturing cost as well as selling price. Given that these functions played a critical role in meeting international safety standards, Chris had been trying his best to convince CMM that whereas the specifications of PPE determine the life or death of miners in mining accidents, it is vital to comply with the rigorous international health and safety standards. A similar situation also happened with the SCSR. Nevertheless, despite hard negotiations over relevant topics, no consensus was made for the past 18 months. As a result, the launches of the products had been put off five times. At the end of 2013, TECHSAVVY failed to achieve their initial anticipated annual revenue of US$9 million, only producing US$4.8 million through the OEM business (see Table 3.1).",

The results present an intriguing picture of the 10-year internationalization and entrepreneurial journey of a DE firm in the world's largest EE, China. Although TECHSAVVY's collaboration with a Chinese SOE to upgrade to OBM might be an unsuccessful try, our research still brings insightful and profound implications for other DE global start-ups that have been or will be venturing into an EE context.",

First, our findings contribute to the international entrepreneurship literature, as it reveals that knowledge in entrepreneurial firms tend to be individualized to the founder or the top management team and that SMEs are inclined to exhibit speedier entry or higher commitment to internationalization when their entrepreneurs have personal international knowledge or prior living/working experience in foreign markets. Second, consistent with Yamakawa et al. (2013) study on the internationalization choice of EE new ventures, we discovered that DE global start-ups may decide to take the plunge to internationalize into EEs rather than well-established DEs because it seems more advantageous for these firms to exploit their advanced knowledge and technology as competitive advantages in EE than in DE markets. Third, we conducted a comprehensive in-depth case study, ranging from literature retrieval, archival research, a variety of personal interviews to field investigation\u2014which responds to recent calls for collecting more first-hand, timely data to capture what is behind the tremendous FDI inflows into China (Lau & Bruton, 2008).",

It is not surprising that TECHSAVVY encountered severe difficulties as it chose to work with a Chinese SOE for upgrading in a politically sensitive industry\u2014mining\u2014that the government considers part of its national security interests.

First, a plethora of studies have discussed the impact of cultural elements such as values, beliefs, and behaviours on the decision-making process (Hofstede, 2015). The differences in decision-making processes between CMM and TECHSAVVY were actually triggered by the cultural differences between the East and the West. As with our findings, it is noticeable that both sides have their own set of core values and basic assumptions on forming strategic alliances. It was imperative for TECHSAVVY to gain a better understanding of CMM's anticipated goal of their strategic alliance; TECHSAVVY will not be able to make a breakthrough until it gets buy-in and approval from key personnel at CMM. In other words, their disputes on product specification and pricing strategies will not be resolved unless TECHSAVVY can enhance its capabilities in cross-cultural negotiation and communication to work with a Chinese SOE. This is an obvious management development need and an interesting opportunity for a quality provider in this area.",

Given that the administrative and marketing systems in China are very different, TECHSAVVY was supposed to use a strategic alliance with CMM as a stepping stone to gain legitimacy to help foreign firms attach themselves to local business and political networks in the Chinese market. However, despite being a partner with an SOE local partner CMM, TECHSAVVY failed to link itself into an appropriate network that enabled it to become an approved PPE supplier to this company. Viewed from this angle, owing to China's institutional environment, a contractual nonequity governance mode for international strategic alliances may only provide a limited role in the establishment of a trusting partnership.",

Since upgrading to OBM requires large investment in R&D as well as brand marketing, it faces higher risks of failure (Chin et al., 2016)\u2014which is also very likely to kindle the animosity of GVC leaders in the target domain and, in turn, intensify competition. Hence, it is doubtful that TECHSAVVY will be able to solely rely on OBM business to achieve further growth in today's uncertain and competitive environment.
