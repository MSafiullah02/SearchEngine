On 13 February 2012, three recruits from the same squad were reported ill with a body temperature of approximately 38.5\u00b0C. Eleven days later, this outbreak was reported to the SXCDC. Definition of an ARD case was given as an individual with a body temperature over 37.8\u00b0C and with at least a respiratory symptom such as cough or sore throat. Recruits who were randomly distributed in the MTC, but did not have any symptoms were chosen as healthy controls. Until 8 March, 2\u201320 ARD cases per day were reported over an almost 4\u2010week period, and 176 patients were confirmed as having ARD.

In July and August 2009, an outbreak of HAdV\u20103 infection caused pharyngo\u2010conjunctival fever in 67 pupils while another outbreak of HAdV\u20104 infection caused acute upper respiratory tract disease in 11 students (15\u201318 years old) in Xi'an, located in central Shaanxi (data not published). The isolated strains of HAdV\u20107 in Shaanxi (n = 4, three from this outbreak and one from Hanzhong in 2009) showed high similarity in sequences (99.8\u2013100%) and indicated the possibility of the same ancestor. It is interesting that several types of HAdV are circulating in Shaanxi province which indicates the need for a surveillance network for adenovirus infections.",

As we know that IgM antibody predominates in early immune responses, this is always used as an early diagnosis for infection. However, Kornadt et al. found that in adenoviruses infections, fewer antibody rises and weak reactions were observed in the IgM test than in the IgA test. A test for IgM antibodies was found to be unrewarding and IgM antibodies were present in individuals without fresh HAdV infection. Therefore, the IgM antibodies test was not suitable for the early diagnosis of HAdV infection 34. Previous reports from the 2006 and 2009 outbreaks have shown 83.3% and 35% IgA positivity rates, respectively. Similarly, serum samples from the acute phase in this study showed 50% IgA positivity. From 30 IgA\u2010positive samples, 29 were also positive for IgG both in the acute phase and in the convalescence phase. IgG in the acute phase and in the convalescence phase showed no obvious change, whereas the neutralization antibody was significantly different in various phases. It was also noted that IgA against HAdV was negative in all samples in the first 3 days of disease onset, but all were positive on the 8th day. From 15 samples that were HAdV positive by PCR, IgA antibody was not present. It was noted that PCR could detect HAdV within 5 days from onset. Two individuals from the control group (apparently healthy) were also positive for IgA, indicating a possible non\u2010apparent HAdV infection.",

IgA antibody began to appear on the 4th day after onset and showed 100% positivity on the 8th day. The virus strain in this outbreak was highly similar to the virus isolated in Hanzhong prefecture, Shaanxi in 2009. Recent outbreaks of HAdV in Shaanxi province indicate that vaccine development, and enhanced epidemiological and virological surveillance of HAdV infections are necessary in Shaanxi as well as in China.",
