Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the children and immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction were performed to investigate the presence of respiratory viruses. HBoV was detected in 4 out of 66 patients. Two of the HBoV-positive infants were co-infected with other viruses. The principal clinical findings in HBoV-positive children were: nasal obstruction, catarrh, cough, fever and dyspnea. This study revealed HBoV infection in children aged <2 months, suggesting that the infection may occur at a very early age.",

Children under 7 months of age, who were hospitalized at the Professor Hosannah de Oliveira pediatric hospital in Salvador, Brazil with a diagnosis of respiratory infection, were included. A questionnaire was applied to collect clinical data and laboratory results. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected to investigate respiratory viruses. The presence of adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using a commercially available kit (Chemicon \u00d5 Temecula, CA, USA). The presence of HBoV and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA extraction was performed in the NPA using a commercial kit (Wizard \u00d5 Genomic DNA Purification Kit, Promega \u00d5 Madison, WI, USA), and RNA extraction was carried out using Trizol \u00d5 (Invitrogen \u00d5 Carlsbad, CA, USA). HBoV was detected by PCR using the product of DNA extraction.",

Four children (6.1%) tested positive for HBoV, two of whom were found to be simultaneously infected with other viruses: RSV and enterovirus in one case, and HRV in the other. Their ages ranged from 43 to 191 days. All four children had nasal obstruction and rhonchi, while three had productive coughs, dyspnea, fever and chest indrawing and rales at lung auscultation. Two patients had acute diarrhea. A summary of clinical data and laboratory results is shown in Table 1 .",

Two children were <2 months of age, suggesting that the infection may occur at a very early age. Clinical findings in children with HBoV in this study were very similar to those previously described [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . This study was carried out in hospitalized children; hence presumably more severely ill patients were evaluated. However, only one HBoV-positive patient had radiological findings consistent with pneumonia. In this study, two of the four children with HBoV infection had diarrhea. It is possible that HBoV infection may involve both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [14, 15] . In spite of the limited sample size, the present study highlights the fact that HBoV may be present in very young infants hospitalized with ARI. When nutritional support is required for months or even years, home-based-enteral nutrition has been considered the best solution for the impaired children and their families [1] . In hospital settings, the use of blended whole food in enteral tube feedings showed that no commercial enteral diets delivered less than the desired amounts of nutrients [2] , which may result in clinical and nutritional implications for patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the nutritional quality of home-made enteral diets and their effects on growth parameters. Thirty patients, cared for by three private care firms, were enrolled in this study. All patients were bed-ridden with 27 requiring mechanical ventilation. Since the cost of the enteral diets were not reimbursed by the insurance companies, the families were responsible for their purchase. Due to the high cost of commercially manufactured enteral feeding, most families chose to use home-made enteral diets. Nutrients were delivered via a nasointestinal tube (two patients) or a feeding tube inserted through a gastrostomy (28 patients). Infusion pumps were not available for any patient. The patients' mean age at the time of the study, was 79 months (range from 15 to 159 months). The mean duration of the home enteral nutrition therapy was 14 months (range from 4 to 39 months). Adjustments in the calorie and protein contents and volume of the feeds were made according to the nutritional status of the children.",

The expected nutrient content of both types of feed was calculated from food composition tables. Percentage ratios of expected values/measured values were calculated for macronutrients and energy. Weight-for-age, height-for-age and body mass-for-age indexes were assessed in relation to the reference population [4] . Table 1 presents the analytical results. The concentration of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, fiber and the energy values of the SB feed were significantly lower than those of the MB feed. The osmolality was also significantly lower. The SB feed contained significantly more water. In the MB feed, the measured values for the macronutrients and energy corresponded to 70% of the prescribed values; SB feed presented measured values that corresponded to >50% of the prescribed values, except for carbohydrate.
