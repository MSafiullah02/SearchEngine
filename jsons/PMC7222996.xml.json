However, opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADE) are common and include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, sedation, and respiratory depression. The incidence of ORADE is 9.1 to 11.5% in retrospective studies of adults undergoing surgical procedures [6\u20138]. The most common ORADE were respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and central nervous system in nature. ORADE are associated with other poor outcomes as well. In analyses adjusting for confounders, those who experienced ORADE had significantly greater odds of prolonged length of stay, higher hospitalization costs, and mortality [7, 8]. In a study of opioid na\u00efve patients presenting for noncardiac surgery, independent risk factors for ORADE included older age, male sex, and increased comorbidity as measured by Elixhauser Comorbidity Score and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) weight [8].",

The prevalence of preoperative opioid use ranges from 8.8 to 35%, with higher rates in certain groups such as orthopedic populations [9\u201314]. In a large cohort study of patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery, preoperative use of opioids was associated with longer hospital stays, greater rates of readmission, and increased expenditures, adjusting for confounders [12]. Similarly, associations between preoperative opioid use and longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates have been found in general, vascular, and orthopedic populations [15\u201318]. Preoperative opioid use has been associated with increased postoperative morbidity, including infection, respiratory failure, and cardiac events [10, 13, 16].",

Persistent opioid use is increasingly recognized as a risk of surgery. In a cohort study of patients undergoing minor and major surgeries, the incidence of new persistent opioid use, defined as opioid prescription between 90 and 180 days postoperatively, was similar between the two groups, ranging from 5.9 to 6.5%. The incidence in the nonoperative cohort was 0.4% [19]. Independent risk factors for persistent opioid use in this cohort were tobacco use, alcohol and substance use disorders, anxiety, depression, and presence of preoperative pain conditions. In a different retrospective cohort study of 11 types of surgical procedures, defining persistent opioid use as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or greater than 120 days\u2019 supply 3 months to 1 year postoperatively, the incidence of chronic opioid use ranged from 0.119 for cesarean section to 1.41% for total knee replacement [20\u2022]. Independent risk factors for persistent opioid use in this cohort were male sex, age over 50 years, preoperative use of benzodiazepines or antidepressants, depression, and alcohol or substance use disorders.",

            "text": "Prior to surgery, postoperative pain is one of the most common concerns for patients. In a US national survey of patients who had undergone surgery in the 5 years prior to survey date, 65% of respondents rated postoperative pain as moderate, severe, or extreme. Post-discharge, 62% of respondents reported continued moderate, severe, or extreme pain [21]. Certain surgical procedures are associated with high pain levels. In a prospective study of surgical patients in German hospitals, surgeries with the highest pain levels included major spinal surgeries as well as orthopedic or trauma surgeries on extremities [22]. There are other risk factors for experiencing high levels of postoperative pain besides surgical-related factors. In the aforementioned German study, after adjusting for surgery type, risk factors for severe postoperative pain were preoperative chronic pain, younger age, and female sex [23]. Other studies have been supportive of these findings [24\u201326]. Preoperative opioid use and dependence has also been found to be associated with greater postoperative pain levels and increased opioid requirements [10, 27\u201329]. Preoperative psychological factors such as catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, and expectation of pain are also important predictors of high postoperative acute pain intensity [30\u201333].",

Furthermore, high levels of depression or anxiety may portend less successful rehabilitation and a slower return to baseline function/recovery [5]. Several tools have been validated for use in the preoperative period. In high-risk patients, including those with opioid use disorder, poorly controlled anxiety, and/or psychiatric conditions, several preoperative assessment tools may be combined in order to attain a global preoperative risk assessment and individualized preoperative optimization plan. The most commonly used screening tool to detect preoperative anxiety is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scale (Table 2) [43, 44]. This 13-question screening tool aims to identify patients who will benefit most from non-pharmacologic preoperative anxiety reduction strategies such as mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale has been well validated in the perioperative period to identify patients as highest risk of poor pain control in the acute postoperative period [45]. It has recently been validated for daily use in surgical patients [46]. Clinical tools to predict risk of postoperative opioid use disorder are evolving but typically include screening for factors such as smoking and substance use status, young age, history of childhood sexual abuse, and lack of social support [47, 48].",

            "text": "A meta-analysis showed that psychological preparation for surgery, including interventions such as procedural information, cognitive techniques, and relaxation techniques, may be beneficial for postoperative pain outcomes [51]. However, given the heterogeneity of past studies, the overall level of current evidence is considered low [51]. Some of the most promising evidence comes from studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions. For example, in a study of patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery, preoperative CBT decreased analgesic use in the CBT group [52]. In a small study of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was associated with less back pain at 1 month [53]. However, further study is needed on the potential impact of a preoperative psychological optimization program that includes interventions such as mindfulness and CBT. Psychological prehabilitation programs such as CBT require access to a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) or other clinicians skilled in the administration of such techniques\u2014a service that few preoperative evaluation clinics in the USA provide at present\u2014outside of major academic medical centers. One feasible approach may be to consolidate CBT services for preoperative smoking cessation initiatives with those for preoperative anxiety and pain reduction programs\u2014a system by which the preoperative evaluation clinic serves as the integrator of optimization services as well as the referral source [54]. Another barrier to the implementation of CBT interventions in the preoperative preparation process is the need for a 6\u20138-week window of time before surgery in order to implement the full CBT program. Emerging models to predict at-risk patients continue to be developed and may be leveraged during the preoperative assessment [55].",
