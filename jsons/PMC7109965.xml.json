Children were participants in the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) birth cohort study, originally designed to investigate atopy and asthma. Details of the study design have been published elsewhere [20]. Recruitment took place in 1996 and 1997. A screening questionnaire on maternal allergy was completed by 10,232 pregnant women visiting 1 of 52 prenatal clinics in The Netherlands [21]. On the basis of this screening, 7862 women were invited to participate, and 4146 agreed and gave informed consent. After birth, the baseline study population consisted of 3963 children. Questionnaires for parental completion were sent to the parents during pregnancy, when the children reached the ages of 3 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. DNA was successfully collected from 1037 children. Of these children, 987 were of Dutch ancestry and were used for analysis; the 50 children of non-Dutch origin were excluded. The frequency of RTI among the children was included on the questionnaire, first at 1 year of age and then annually until 4 years of age. Data on genotypes and the frequency of RTI were complete in 896 Dutch children.",

DNA was amplified using REPLI-g UltraFast technology (Qiagen). SNPs of MBL2 were selected on the basis of known functionality (n = 7) combined with haplotype-tagging SNPs that have a minor allele frequency of >0.1 (n = 6), selected from the publicly available database of the International HapMap Project [22]. The studied SNPs are listed in table 1. Genotyping was performed by competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction using KASPar genotyping chemistry, performed under contract by KBiosciences (http://www.kbiosciences.co.uk/). Previous functional analyses by Madsen et al. [5] and others, including Wiertsema et al. [4], demonstrated that the YA/O genotype has intermediate levels of functional MBL multimers. The YA/O genotype has been reported to be functionally different from YA/A and was recently reported to be beneficial for improved outcomes of severe infections [23]. Thus, exon 1 SNPs were combined with the promoter polymorphism Y/X to define high-producing (A/A), intermediate-producing (YA/O), and deficient (XA/O and O/O) MBL2 genotypes.",

Differences in haplotype and genotype frequencies (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) between children with frequent RTIs and those without reported RTIs were calculated. MBL2 haplotypes were finally divided into those associated with high (LYPA), intermediate (HYPA, LYQA, and LXPA-C), or low (LXPA-G, HYPD, LYPB, and LYQC) expression of MBL, to increase power. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated by means of \u03c72 statistics for the association between deficient MBL2 genotypes and frequent RTIs versus no reported RTIs. Finally, all children were included in ordinal regression analyses (per year and for years 1\u20134 cumulatively), to estimate the association between MBL2 haplotypes, deficient MBL2 genotypes, and categories of annual RTI frequency.

This well-designed study (n = 252) was a prospective clinical study that estimated the number of days at risk of acute respiratory infections (equivalent to RTIs) and recorded the number of acute respiratory infection episodes weekly during a 2-year period, with data gathered from 6 weeks after birth. An increased risk for acute RTI was found in MBL-insufficient children (determined on the basis of exon 1 and promoter polymorphisms) compared with MBL-sufficient children, but the risk association was largely restricted to children aged 6\u201317 months. There could be several reasons for the conflict in results between this study and ours. First, there are differences in the genetic background of the study populations, because the Greenlandic study included mainly Eskimo children (80%) and our study included only white children. RTIs are known to occur earlier and more frequently among Eskimo children [25]. The specific genetic background and an a priori high risk of RTI make the results of Koch et al. hard to generalize to white children. Second, RTIs were measured differently in both studies. We used questionnaire data to assess RTI, whereas Koch et al. used exact measures of numbers of RTI episodes assessed by clinical examination. Third, we analyzed haplotypes in relation to 3 MBL2 genotype groups (high producing, intermediate producing, and deficient) based on exon 1 and promoter SNPs, whereas Koch et al. used 2 groups (MBL sufficient and MBL insufficient) based on the same polymorphisms. Finally, we analyzed years 1 and 2 of life separately, but further determination of the vulnerable period, as done by Koch et al., was impossible with our annual data.",

Strictly speaking, RTI in our study indicates the presence of respiratory symptoms that the parents considered more serious than a common cold. This may lead to misclassification in the reported frequency of RTI, but the misclassification can be supposed to be nondifferential (i.e., to be independent of MBL2 genotype status). To study the validity of our definitions, we compared the questionnaire data on the reported frequency of RTI with data on the prescription of antibiotics and adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. Antibiotic prescription was highly associated (P < .01) with frequent RTIs, as defined by the questionnaires, and a similar association was seen with adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. Furthermore, as with the frequency of RTI, we observed no association of MBL2 genotype status with ear, nose, and throat surgery or antibiotic prescription rates.",
