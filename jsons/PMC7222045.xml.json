            "text": "Gambling is widely viewed as a legitimate and socially acceptable leisure activity (Calado and Griffiths 2016; Stucki and Rihs-Middel 2007). However, gambling has also been identified as being addictive and problematic with severe negative consequences, to the extent that some individuals experience harm as a result of their gambling behaviour (Currie et al. 2006; Langham et al. 2016; Splevins et al. 2010). Gambling addiction was initially defined as an impulse control disorder in the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association (APA) 1980) and reclassified in DSM-V (APA 2013) as a behavioural addiction (for a discussion see Hasin et al. 2013). Further, gambling addiction (pathological gambling) has been recognised as one of the most difficult disorders to treat (Volberg 1996), with evidence suggesting that it has become a problem for many countries across the globe. A recent systematic review found that the prevalence of problem gambling across the world was up to 5.8% with varying estimates across different countries (Calado and Griffiths 2016). The associated negative social and health consequences of problem gambling have made gambling a major public policy agenda in many developed countries, and the legalisation and licencing of gambling venues have therefore been considered public health concerns in countries such as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom (Korn et al. 2003; Levens et al. 2005; Shaffer and Korn 2002).",

Group 1 are the \u2018Behavioural Conditioned\u2019, whose pathway to problem gambling is characterised by environmental factors such as the social context and a family history of gambling, among others. Group 2 are the \u2018Emotionally Vulnerable\u2019, whose pathway is characterised by mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, and Group 3, \u2018Antisocial Impulsivists\u2019, are characterised by various personality disorders. In this paper, we contribute to understanding the factors that play a role in the Behavioural Conditioned pathway, with a focus on the impact of local area/neighbourhood effects. We contribute to the literature by examining the impact of ethnic diversity on gambling. Alongside the increasing prevalence of gambling, local communities around the world are increasingly becoming diverse, and the implications of this diversity have been the focus of a growing body of research (Akay et al. 2017; Dincer 2011; Easterly and Levine 1997). We argue that the level of ethnic diversity within a community is likely to influence gambling behaviour given different cultures have different attitudes to gambling (Raylu and Oei 2004).",

            "text": "Conceptually, ethnic diversity could be negatively or positively associated with gambling, and thus understanding the relationship between ethnic diversity and gambling is an empirical task. Consistent with a negative association, ethnic diversity has been shown to influence social capital, an important factor that plays a role in gambling decisions. Existing research has demonstrated a negative association between ethnic diversity and social capital (Awaworyi Churchill 2017; Dincer 2011; Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov 2015). Social capital plays an important role in shaping the social environment, which may either promote or discourage gambling. For instance, with lower social capital that engenders social isolation, individuals might find ways to cope with isolation and this could drive them towards gambling and other addictive behaviours (McQuade and Gill 2012; Thomas et al. 2009). Further, people may gamble more when they do so with acquaintances or play in groups (Griffiths and Barnes 2008; Rogers and Webley 2001). Thus, peer effects linked with social capital play significant roles in influencing gambling behaviour (Bursztyn et al. 2014; Rogers 1998).",

            "text": "The increase in problem gambling is often linked to the supply of opportunities to gamble. For example, Marshall (2005) shows that at the local area level, gambling behaviours can be linked to the availability of electronic gaming machines, which is known to be correlated with local area deprivation (Wardle et al. 2014). Higher levels of ethnic diversity have been shown to hinder collective action (see, e.g., Glennerster et al. 2013). Thus, even if gambling addiction is found to negatively influence wellbeing, the lack of collaboration associated with higher diversity could hinder collective action (from non-gamblers and policymakers) aimed at efforts to reduce the supply of gaming machines within a community. On the other hand, ethnic and cultural diversity is positively associated with higher wages and productivity through its effects on innovation (Hewlett et al. 2013; Ottaviano and Peri 2006; Trax et al. 2015). Thus, with higher wages resulting from cultural and ethnic diversity, the socio-economic gap narrows and financial challenges are less likely to drive people towards gambling, given that gambling is known to be higher among lower socio-economic groups (Brown et al. 1992; Clotfelter and Cook 1999; van der Maas 2016).",

The most recent Australian census shows that 26% of the Australian population were born overseas while about 50% of the population were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2017). More importantly, gambling is a popular activity and a significant public health issue in Australia. Recent surveys show annual gambling participation prevalence of about 64% and up to 74% for some Australian states and territories (Davidson et al. 2016; Dowling et al. 2016; Stevens et al. 2015). The latest statistics on gambling in Australia released by the Queensland Government Statistician\u2019s Office also demonstrate that between 2016 and 2017, Australians gambled AUD $209 billion and lost AUD $24 billion, which represents a per capita loss of approximately AUD $1300. These figures suggest that Australia has the highest gambling rates in the world. The severity of gambling in Australia is even more pronounced when compared to other countries that are well-known for gambling. For instance, gambling losses per adult in Australia are more than double those in the United States (US) and other Western countries (Queensland Government Statistician\u2019s Office 2018).",

Until recently, Australia has had limited data from which to research and hence understand the patterns of gambling behaviours within a population-based sample. Cross-sectional surveys have been conducted within Australia (see, e.g., the discussion by the Productivity Commission 2010), but the trade-off in obtaining detailed information on gambling is that only limited socioeconomic data can be collected due to survey length and cost considerations. Other knowledge is extracted from data using clinical samples that, by definition, do not allow us to understand the consumption patterns of sub-clinical populations. The introduction of detailed gambling data (in 2015), in wave 15 of the HILDA survey, offers a unique opportunity to explore gambling expenditure in a rich, nationally representative household-level data set. Investigating population-based samples aids our understanding of how society, as a whole, is impacted by the increasing presence of gambling products in our communities and our daily lives.",

Our study also contributes to a small literature that examines ethnic differences in gambling rates (Chhabra 2007; Raylu and Oei 2004; Walker et al. 2006). For instance, in the US, research has shown that Hispanic, Asian and Black adolescents spend significantly more on gambling than White adolescents (Volberg et al. 2008), while in Australia, studies have found higher levels of gambling among Chinese residents than other residents (Oei and Raylu 2010). Our study differs from these studies in that we do not focus on variations in gambling rates between ethnic groups. Accordingly, we present the first study examining how the level of ethnic diversity in a community influences gambling.",

Consistent with the gambling literature (Awaworyi Churchill and Farrell 2018; Korman et al. 2008; Raisamo et al. 2014), our main measures of gambling behaviour are based on the PGSI measure of gambling behaviours (Ferris and Wynne 2001). The PGSI was designed to be an effective instrument for accessing problem gambling severity in population-based samples and has been extensively tested and validated (Currie et al. 2013; Holtgraves 2008; Orford et al. 2010). The PGSI is based on a nine-item questionnaire that captures adverse consequences of gambling experienced and problematic gambling behaviour in the past 12 months. The nine items (shown in Table 9) are rated on a four-point scale, where 0 represents \u2018never\u2019 and 3 represents \u2018almost always\u2019. The PGSI is a sum of responses from the nine-item questionnaire and thus scores range from 0 to 27 with higher scores representing greater gambling problems. We use the PGSI scores as our first measure of gambling behaviour.",

This allows us to group survey respondents with similar risks of developing harmful gambling behaviours from low risk to high risk.

Non-problem gamblers are identified as those who did not experience adverse consequences of gambling or engage in any problematic gambling behaviour in the past 12 months, and thus have a PGSI score of 0. Low-risk gamblers are those with PGSI scores of 1\u20132, moderate-risk gamblers are those with scores 3\u20137, and problem gamblers are those with PGSI scores of 8 or above. From this transformation of the continuous PGSI into risk categories, a four-point ordinal scale is created that captures the various risk spectrums such that 1 represents non-problem gamblers 2 represents low-risk gamblers, 3 represents moderate-risk gamblers and 4 represents problem gamblers. To examine the effects of social capital on the various risk spectrums, we also use four dummy variables reflecting respondents in each gambling risk spectrum as one of our model specifications.",

In the context of our analysis, this is plausible given the relatively low R-squared in the baseline model. We therefore adopt a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation approach to ensure results are robust to endogeneity. We instrument the average ethnic diversity at the postcode level using a measure of ethnic diversity at the state level based on 1991 (older) census information, which allows the instrument to operate as a lag. The logic underpinning the exclusion restriction is that historical measures of ethnic diversity should affect current levels of diversity, but should not be correlated with any unobserved factors that change contemporary attitude towards gambling. The existing literature has effectively used such lagged values to deal with endogeneity (Akay et al. 2017; Glennerster et al. 2013; Longhi 2014). In the context of our study, we use information from the 1991 Australian census to generate indices of ethnic diversity at the state level. Historic geographic patterns within a state reflect patterns of neighbourhoods (postcodes) within the state and thus, historic state level diversity should be correlated with postcode-level diversity. However, diversity from more than 2 decades prior to the collection of the HILDA gambling module will not influence gambling behaviour. The use of state-level ethnic diversity to instrument for ethnic diversity has the added advantage of using a variable from a broader geographic area to instrument diversity at a lower geographic level given that the severity of endogeneity decreases with the geographic size (Dustmann and Preston 2001).",

We use a dummy variable for each risk category and run logit regressions to examine the effects of ethnic diversity on respondents in each risk category. Table 3 reports results for this exercise. Columns 1, 2, 3 and 4 report results for the effects of ethnic diversity on non-problem gamblers, low-risk gamblers, moderate-risk gamblers and problem gamblers, respectively. Although the coefficient on ethnic diversity is statistically insignificant in Columns 1 and 2, we find that higher levels of ethnic diversity are associated with the probability of being a moderate-risk and problem gambler. The magnitude of the coefficients on ethnic diversity in Columns 3 and 4 suggests that the ethnic diversity has the strongest effect on problem gambling. Specifically, a unit increase in ethnic diversity generates a 28.7 and 50.2 percentage point changes in the probability of being a moderate-risk and problem gambler, respectively.",

To control for financial risk, we also take advantage of the HILDA \u2018financial risk\u2019 question that provides information on the amount of financial risk that respondents are willing to take with spare cash. Panel D of Table 4 reports results for regressions in which we control for the Big-Five and financial risk.

This finding could be because the impact of ethnic diversity is partly mediated by personality traits. Future research can examine this mediating role in more detail.",

The gambling module in the HILDA survey asked respondents about 10 gambling activities and the average monthly expenditures associated with these activities. We calculate an annual gambling expenditure variable using this information and deflate this with income to generate a variable that captures the annual gambling expenditure share of income. We also generate a second gambling variable, which is the sum of gambling activities in which respondents engage. We use these two variables as alternative measures of gambling to examine the effects of ethnic diversity. Results reported in Table 5 show that ethnic diversity is associated with an increase in (1) the number of gambling activities respondents engage in; and (2) the share of gambling expenditure to income. Specifically, we find that a unit increase in ethnic diversity is associated with a 0.5% increase in the share of gambling expenditure to income, and an 11% change in the number of gambling activities respondents engage in.",

A well-known alternative to the index of ethnic fractionalisation is the index of ethnic polarisation, which captures the conflict dimension of diversity. Thus, we examine the robustness of our results to the use of the polarisation index. Further, our main set of results are based on ethnic diversity measures where ethnicity is defined based on the country of birth of respondent\u2019s father. Here, we examine the sensitivity of our results to defining ethnicity based on: (1) respondent\u2019s country of birth, and (2) the country of birth of respondent\u2019s father. Table 6 reports results for the effects of these alternative measures of ethnic diversity. We find that the effects of ethnic diversity on gambling are not sensitive to the measure of ethnic diversity given that the positive effects of ethnic diversity on gambling are consistent albeit with varying effect sizes.",

For social capital to qualify as a channel of influence, in addition to being correlated with ethnic diversity, it should also be correlated with gambling, and the inclusion of social capital as an additional covariate in the regression linking gambling to ethnic diversity should decrease the magnitude of the coefficient on ethnic diversity or render it statistically insignificant.",

Thus, Column 1 of Table 7 reports results for effects of ethnic diversity on social capital while Columns 2 and 3 report effects on PGSI and risk status, respectively. Results suggest that an increase in ethnic diversity is associated with lower social capital. Consistent with our main results (i.e., full sample), results from the reduced sample also show that ethnic diversity is positively associated with gambling behaviour.",

Our findings, therefore, point to the need for policies that mitigate the negative effects of diversity on social capital. Indeed, as local communities become more diverse, individuals are presented with increased opportunities to interact with people of different ethnic groups with different cultures, practices and beliefs. This should be viewed as an opportunity to facilitate intergroup cooperation that builds social cohesion rather than discrimination. As a multicultural society, it is important to foster greater tolerance through relevant education policies that help individuals embrace each other\u2019s differences. This forges stronger bonds that discourage social exclusion, which is likely to provoke or nurture gambling behaviour. Our results also suggest the need for multicultural gambling education in highly diverse communities.",
