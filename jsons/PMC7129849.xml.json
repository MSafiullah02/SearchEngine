Infected tissue contained numerous bacteria, but no infiltrating neutrophils. Bacteria were shown to release a protease activity that degrades the human chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), which is important for neutrophil recruitment. In a mouse model of soft-tissue infection the bacteria produced fatal necrotic infections with reduced neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, the strains were mutated in silCR, encoding the pheromone peptide SilCR. Purified SilCR inhibited production of IL-8 protease activity in vitro and restored neutrophil migration, thereby rescuing mice infected with original isolates and well as heterologous strains.",

Doxorubicin and etoposide-induced apoptosis is impaired in c-Myc null cells, whereas camptothecin-induced cell death occurs normally.

The authors show that complete protection can from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in wild-type cells can only be achieved when caspases, serine proteases and cytochrome c release are blocked simultaneously and suggest c-Myc is essential to all pathways.",

PGP-4008 activity was characterized with different cell lines, and the authors showed that it potentiates the cytotoxicity of Pgp substrates only on cell lines that overexpress Pgp, and increases drug accumulation inside the cell. PGP-4008 has no effect on non-Pgp-overexpressing cells, nor does it affect the toxicity of non-Pgp substrates. PGP-4008 is specific to Pgp and does not antagonize MRP. In vivo, tumor growth was significantly slower when mice were treated with a combination of PGP-4008 and doxorubicin. Although more clinical studies are necessary to better characterize PGP-4008, it seems to be a promising drug because it specifically reverts Pgp-mediate MDR.",
