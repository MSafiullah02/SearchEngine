Cyanosis may be present. With milder effusions, lethargy and lack of stamina may be the only clinical signs. Animals, especially cats, with mild to moderately severe effusions often adapt by decreasing their activity, thus concealing their illness until it is severe. With chronic pleural effusion, dogs and cats may present with coughing as the only clinical sign.1 Physical findings depend on the amount of fluid present but include muffled heart and lung sounds.",

The needle may be rotated if fluid is not visible in the needle hub or a syringe may be attached and gentle negative pressure applied.6 If a scar from a previous surgical incision is present, the needle should be inserted at least 1.5 cm away from the site to avoid abdominal viscera that may have adhered to the abdominal wall in the area of the scar. To enhance fluid collection, abdominal compression may be applied when an over-the-needle catheter is used after the stylet has been removed, leaving only the catheter in the abdominal cavity.

This swollen, loose, homogeneous, eosinophilic nuclear chromatin pattern characterizes the degenerate neutrophil (Fig. 15.2\n). Although all cell types are exposed to the same toxin, degenerative change is evaluated only in neutrophils.",

Some neutrophils in effusions may be hypersegmented. Hypersegmentation is an age-related change; the nuclear chromatin condenses and eventually breaks into round, tightly clumped spheres (pyknosis) (Fig. 15.4\n). These aged neutrophils are often seen phagocytized by macrophages (cytophagia) (Fig. 15.5\n). The presence of nondegenerate neutrophils suggests that the fluid is not septic; however, bacteria that are not strong toxin producers, for example, Actinomyces spp., may be associated with nondegenerate neutrophils. Also, some infectious agents, such as Ehrlichia and Toxoplasma spp. and various fungi, may be associated with nondegenerate neutrophils.",

Nonseptic exudates may be associated with a wide range of pathological conditions that elicit an inflammatory response, such as tumor necrosis; chemical irritants, such as urine and bile; or the presence of a sterile foreign body.",

Clinical FIP may occur in cats of all ages, but the proportion of cats with FIP between ages 6 months and 2 years is significantly higher compared with the control cats in similar age groups.19 In effusive FIP, fluid may accumulate in the abdomen, thorax, or pericardium or in all cavities. Evaluation of fluid may lend significant support to a diagnosis of FIP. The effusion is odorless, straw colored to golden, may contain flecks or fibrin strands, and foams upon agitation because of the high protein content, which is often greater than 4 g/dL. Cell counts may be variable but are typically 2000 to 6000 cells/\u03bcL, and typically hemodilution is minimal. Cytologically, the typical FIP effusion has a prominent stippled proteinaceous basophilic background (Fig. 15.34\n) and consists primarily (60%\u201380%) of nondegenerate to mildly degenerate neutrophils and lesser numbers of macrophages, small lymphocytes, and occasionally plasma cells. Effusions consisting primarily of neutrophils but with large numbers of macrophages are referred to as pyogranulomatous and are also common in effusions associated with FIP. Although these findings are not diagnostic of FIP, when correlated with clinical findings, a presumptive diagnosis of FIP may be made. Other diagnostic tests are often used collaboratively to diagnose FIP. These include determining the albumin-to-globulin (A:G) ratio in serum and fluid. A serum A:G ratio less than 0.8 g/dL and effusion A:G ratio less than 0.9 g/dL are often present with FIP. Anti\u2013feline corona virus (FCoV) antibodies in serum should be interpreted with caution because many healthy cats are FCoV antibody positive.19, 20 Low to medium titers (1:25, 1:100, 1:400) of FCoV antibodies are of no diagnostic value in determining FIP infection; however, antibody titers of 1:1600 increased the probability of FIP.20 A negative test result does not rule out the possibility of FIP infection. In one study, the anti-FCoV antibody test was negative in 10% of the cats, which did, in fact, have FIP.20 Tests that show promise include reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on effusion fluids and an RT-PCR for the detection of FCoV messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus far, histological examination of affected tissue samples remains the gold standard for diagnosing FIP.\n",

Macrophages may have small, punctate clear cytoplasmic vacuoles, and plasma cells may also present (Fig. 15.40\n). Chylous effusions are odorless and may vary in color from classic \u201cmilky white\u201d to an opaque-yellow or pink, depending on diet (i.e., thin or anorectic patients may not have the characteristic opaque white fluid because of lack of dietary lipids) and the number of RBCs in the fluid. Although small lymphocytes are typically thought of as the predominant cell type, chylous effusions may occur with predominantly neutrophils, lipid-containing macrophages, or both.24 Increased neutrophils may occur secondary to inflammation induced by repeated thoracocentesis or merely the presence of chyle in the pleural cavity. Chyle is an irritant, and chronic chylous effusions may cause an inflammatory reaction that may eventually lead to pleural fibrosis.24 Bacterial infection in chylous effusions is uncommon because of the bacteriostatic effect of the fatty acids in chyle.2, 24, 25 However, bacteria may be introduced as a result of repeated thoracocentesis.",

Instead, the white color is classically thought to be the result of cellular debris, lecithin globulin complex, cholesterol from cell membranes, or all of these. Pseudochylous effusions described in humans are most commonly the result of long-standing pleural effusions caused by tuberculosis, rheumatoid pleuritis, and malignant effusions, with resultant cell breakdown within the fluid. Despite much discussion about differentiating these two types of fluids, pseudochylous effusions are not well described in veterinary medicine and are rare in dogs and cats.2, 24 Cytologically, the presence of cellular breakdown material, such as cholesterol crystals, and the lack of a significant lymphocytic cellular component may suggest a pseudochylous effusion (Fig. 15.41\n).

Hemorrhagic effusions secondary to neoplasia may not contain neoplastic cells, or neoplastic cells may be present in low, moderate, or high numbers. The presence or absence of neoplastic cells in a hemorrhagic effusion is often dependent on the type of neoplasm. For example, mesenchymal neoplasms such as hemangiosarcoma (splenic, hepatic, cardiac) often lack neoplastic cells or contain low numbers of neoplastic cells within the hemorrhagic effusion. In comparison, if mesothelioma is associated with a hemorrhagic effusion, moderate to high numbers of atypical mesothelial cells may be evident. However, it should be kept in mind that reactive mesothelial cells may have significant atypia and that differentiating a reactive population from a malignant population is often difficult, even for experienced cytopathologists. Determining the etiology of a hemorrhagic effusion, just as in the case of other effusion categories, requires not only cytological assessment of the fluid but also correlation with clinical signs, history, laboratory data, imaging studies, and often fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of abnormalities found in the respective body cavity. Distinguishing hemorrhagic effusions from iatrogenic blood contamination or inadvertent aspiration of an organ (i.e., liver, spleen) is of diagnostic importance. Differentiating blood contamination from per-acute or acute hemorrhage may be difficult; however, assessment of clinical signs, physical examination findings, and laboratory data are helpful. Hemorrhage of greater than 24 hours\u2019 duration may be differentiated from blood contamination by identifying erythrophagocytosis in the sample (Fig. 15.43\n) and by noting the presence or absence of platelets and the RBC breakdown products, hemosiderin, and hematoidin (Fig. 15.44\n). When blood enters a body cavity, the platelets quickly aggregate, degranulate, and disappear. Also, RBCs are phagocytized and digested by macrophages. Therefore the presence of platelets and lack of erythrophagocytosis or heme breakdown products suggests either per-acute hemorrhage or iatrogenic blood contamination. Concurrent identification of platelets and erythrophagocytosis, with or without heme breakdown products, suggests either chronic hemorrhage or previous hemorrhage with iatrogenic contamination. The absence of platelets, with evidence of erythrophagocytosis, heme breakdown products, or a combination of both, supports chronic or previous hemorrhage.",

Neoplastic effusions may be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Neoplastic epithelial cells often form aggregates, clusters, and sheets. Occasional glandular (acinar) arrangements may be found. Significant anisocytosis, anisokaryosis and anisonucleoliosis may exist, with cell gigantism and abundant basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 15.49\n). Cytoplasm may also contain large clear vacuoles, which push the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, or numerous fine, foamy cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 15.50, Fig. 15.51\n), and may also contain intracytoplasmic eosinophilic secretory material. Documenting strong nuclear criteria of malignancy is important, including anisokaryosis; nuclear gigantism; coarse nuclear chromatin; large, bizarre, or angular nucleoli; multiple nucleoli; nuclear molding; high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios; multinucleation (see Fig. 15.49); numerous mitotic figures; and aberrant mitoses (see Fig. 15.50). When an effusion is diagnostic for epithelial neoplasia, imaging studies of the respective body cavity may identify masses or organomegaly, prompting FNA or tissue biopsy for further characterization.",

            "text": "Thymoma is a neoplasm of thymic epithelium and is a top consideration in the differential diagnosis for a cranial mediastinal mass. Thymomas may be benign or malignant, and both invasive and noninvasive forms exist. Additionally, thymomas may be heterogeneous, cystic, or inflamed. A detailed description of the cytological appearance of aspirates from thymomas is provided in Chapter 17. When thymomas are associated with a thoracic effusion, the effusion may be inconclusive or suggestive of thymoma. An effusion associated with thymoma may contain large numbers of small lymphocytes, which are often a significant and predominant nonneoplastic cell population in thymomas. The presence of a prominent population of small lymphocytes, together with low to moderate numbers of well-differentiated mast cells (also a prominent cell population in thymomas), helps lend support to a diagnosis of thymoma if a cranial mediastinal mass is evident. It is uncommon for the neoplastic epithelial component to exfoliate, and if epithelial cells are present, it may be difficult to differentiate them from reactive mesothelial cells. The neoplastic epithelial cells have somewhat ill-defined borders, are found in aggregates and sheets, and contain small to moderate amounts of pale blue cytoplasm, round central nuclei, and indistinct nucleoli. The cells often are minimally pleomorphic. Direct aspiration, tissue biopsy and histopathology, or flow cytometry of either the mass or effusion fluid may be used to differentiate thymoma from thymic small cell lymphoma. Lymphocyte coexpression of CD4 and CD8, which is characteristic of thymocytes, is suggestive of thymoma.28\n",
