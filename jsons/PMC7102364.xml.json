Since only 30\u201335% of potential transplant candidates have HLA-identical siblings, attention has turned to alternative donor transplants including those using a partially mismatched related donor5678 or phenotypically matched unrelated donor.910 In general, the results of BMT from unrelated donors are inferior to those using matched sibling donors due to an increased incidence and severity of GVHD, rejection, and infections.91011 In a non-malignant BMT setting such as aplastic anemia, the results of unrelated BMT for adults are generally unsatisfactory, although improved survival in younger patients has been reported.12 There are few case reports of unrelated BMT for thalassemia.13 In addition, the search for an unrelated donor is costly, time-consuming and has been attained for less than half of the patients who seek an alternative donor. In contrast to the lengthy unrelated donor search, for more than 90% of patients an HLA-mismatched related donor is readily available.5 Most reports of BMT from partially mismatched related donors are restricted to malignancies. Historically, transplantation of related bone marrow genetically disparate at one or more HLA loci for patients with malignancies or aplastic anemia has been associated with an increased risk of both graft failure and severe GVHD,141516 although the results of recent studies in malignant17 and non-malignant18 settings are encouraging.",

However, despite such improvement it still remains a progressive disease with therapy-related complications (such as hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cardiac disease) progressing with time. Conventional treatment may postpone but not eliminate these complications with the associated morbidity and mortality. In contrast to this, BMT can prevent or delay progression of the aforementioned complications. Approximately 70% of thalassemic patients lack a related matched donor.19 For those patients who lack HLA-identical sibling donors, alternative sources of bone marrow must be sought. It is well known that thalassemia is more frequent in many developing societies where the mortality from this disease remains extremely high and few patients survive to adulthood because it is not possible to give conventional treatment due to inadequate transfusion services and cost of chelating treatment. In such circumstances an alternative BMT from a related donor may be the only salvage therapy for at least some groups of patients. In a preliminary study we reported some results of alternative BMT in patients with thalassemia.20 In the present retrospective study we examined survival, rejection and transplant-related complications after BMT from an alternative donor in a larger number of patients with thalassemia. These results represent the largest single-institution series of patients who have received an alternative BMT for thalassemia.",

Three patients disparate for one antigen were homozygous at the mismatched locus and hence were a one locus mismatch with respect to rejection direction and no locus mismatch with respect to GVHD direction.

In certain circumstances where adequate conventional treatment is not available and the search for an unrelated donor is impossible, BMT from an alternative related donor may become the only available approach for some patients. Most of our patients did not receive adequate treatment because this was impossible to give in their countries, due to religious reasons or to patient non-compliance with desferrioxamine. Obviously, the vast majority of these patients belonged to class 2 or class 3 and had associated hepatitis or liver fibrosis. In such circumstances, even a low number of cured patients may, however, justify alternative BMT for those patients with thalassemia whose survival expectancies are poor while they receive inadequate conventional treatment.

One possible explanation of this high failure rate is that unlike hematological malignancies patients with non-malignant diseases, such as aplastic anemia and thalassemia have an increased risk of graft failure even after HLA-identical sibling BMT probably as a result of absence of prior immunosuppressive treatment, compared with patients with hematological malignancies.

On the other hand, a high rejection rate demonstrates that the conditioning regimens used probably did not provide sufficient immunologic ablation to achieve successful engraftment in the majority of our patients. Over the last few years, investigations into new approaches to immunomodulation after related mismatched transplantation have achieved high engraftment rates and control of acute GVHD. Indeed, the results of recent studies using conditioning regimens including TBI with or without additional TLI in association with T cell depletion for BMT from related mismatch donors are encouraging in terms of sustained engraftment and control of GVHD.517 Undertaking of BMT early in the course of the disease before the patient develops therapy-related complications may be one of the keys to reducing graft failure and transplant-related mortality after BMT from alternative donors.",
