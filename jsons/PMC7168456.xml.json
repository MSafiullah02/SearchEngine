The fine sanatorium buildings in \u201chealthy\u201d locations such as the Blue Mountains are reminders of the desperate attempts to combine sanitary and microbiological principles by isolating patients to prevent spread of the disease while they were treated with rest and diet.\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n During World War II (WWII), intensive screening of Australian troops by miniature x\u2010ray was followed up with bacteriological testing to identify patients with active infection, for whom treatment was compulsory. The success of this program prompted a postwar attempt to eradicate the disease from the civilian population, and the advent of streptomycin and sickness benefit payments made compulsory treatment acceptable to the community.\n11\n\n",
