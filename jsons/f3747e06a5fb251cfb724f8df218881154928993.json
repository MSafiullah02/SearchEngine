            "text": "(SINV) profoundly blocks cellular mRNA translation. Experimental evidence points to viral nonstructural proteins (nsPs), in particular nsP2, as the mediator of this inhibition. However, individual expression of nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 or nsP1-4 does not block cellular protein synthesis in BHK cells. Trans-complementation of a defective SINV replicon lacking most of the coding region for nsPs by the co-expression of nsP1-4 propitiates viral RNA replication at low levels, and inhibition of cellular translation is not observed. Exit of nuclear proteins including T-cell intracellular antigen and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein is clearly detected in SINV-infected cells, but not upon the expression of nsPs, even when the defective replicon was complemented. Analysis of a SINV variant with a point mutation in nsP2, exhibiting defects in the shut-off of host protein synthesis, indicates that both viral RNA replication and the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm are greatly inhibited. Furthermore, nucleoside analogues that inhibit cellular and viral RNA synthesis impede the blockade of host mRNA translation, in addition to the release of nuclear proteins. Prevention of the shut-off of host mRNA translation by nucleoside analogues is not due to the inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, as this prevention is also observed in PKR \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts that do not phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 after SINV infection. Collectively, our observations are consistent with the concept that for the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis to occur, viral RNA replication must take place at control levels, leading to the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "The genome of alphaviruses is a positive RNA molecule (gmRNA) of about 9-11 kb, which directs viral protein synthesis upon infection (Griffin, 2007) . The genome contains two cistrons: the first is located in the 5\u2032 twothirds of the genome and encodes nonstructural proteins (nsPs) that form the viral replication machinery (Jose et al., 2009) . The second open reading frame encodes for the structural proteins that form part of the virus particles, and are synthesized from a subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA; Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . Sindbis virus (SINV) is one of the most studied members of alphaviruses and represents a good model to analyse the regulation of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. After virus entry, the genome is delivered to the cytoplasm and is translated to produce nsP1-4, which participates in genome replication and transcription . These nsPs are synthesized from a single AUG initiation codon rendering two precursor polyproteins, which are proteolytically processed by nsP2 (de Groot et al., 1990) . After initiation at the first AUG initiation codon present in gmRNA, the majority of ribosomes (90-95%) translates this template until a stop codon (UGA) is encountered, producing the precursor P123. However, in a small proportion of cases, there is readthrough of this stop codon, generating the precursor P1234. The four nsPs are generated after proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein precursors. The exact function of the individual proteins has been the subject of intensive research in several laboratories. Thus, nsP1 is an abundant component of the replicative complex and exhibits its activity either as a mature protein or in the form of precursors P123 or P1234. nsP1 is a palmitoylated protein that participates directly in initiation and elongation of the minus-strand RNA synthesis (Hahn et al., 1989; Wang et al., 1991) . During this process, nsP1 interacts with nsP4 (Shirako et al., 2000; Fata et al., 2002) . Different moieties have been recognized in nsP1. The N-terminal region exhibits methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities involved in capping the viral positive-strand RNAs (Mi et al., 1989; Peranen et al., 1995; Ahola et al., 1997) . Association with cellular membranes is promoted by an amphipatic helix located in the middle region of nsP1 (Peranen et al., 1995) that serves to anchor viral replicative complexes to membranes (Salonen et al., 2003) . Several domains have also been distinguished in nsP2: an amino-terminal RNA helicase domain, a central protease domain that catalyses all cleavage reactions between the nonstructural proteins and an inactive RNA methyltransferase-like domain (Gomez de Cedron et al., 1999; Russo et al., 2006) . Apart from its function in viral RNA synthesis, nsP2 is also involved in the interference with cellular transcription and translation. Accordingly, nsP2 can antagonize cellular antiviral responses triggered by alphavirus infection (Garmashova et al., 2006; Breakwell et al., 2007) . Indeed, a proportion of nsP2 localizes to the nucleus and blocks cellular RNA export to the cytoplasm (Rikkonen et al., 1994; Breakwell et al., 2007) . The precise role of nsP3 in virus replication remains poorly understood. nsP3 can be organized into three domains: an amino-terminal macro or X domain (Koonin et al., 1992) , a central alphavirus specific region and a carboxyl region with an hypervariable sequence. Residues located just after the macro domain of nsP3 play a role in positioning of the P23 cleavage site . Additionally, the carboxyl terminal region of nsP3 contains several phosphorylation sites . nsP3 blocks the formation of host cellular stress granules (SGs) through the interaction of its carboxy terminal domain with Ras-GTPase activating protein-binding protein (G3BP), leading to the disruption of these granules that are involved in innate antiviral mechanisms (Fros et al., 2012; Panas et al., 2012) . Finally, nsP4 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the synthesis of the different viral RNAs, i.e. gmRNA, sgmRNA and minus-stranded RNA complementary to the genome (Rubach et al., 2009) . Both P123 + nsP4 and nsP1 + P23 + nsP4 preferentially synthesize the negative strand of viral RNA (Lemm et al., 1994; Shirako and Strauss, 1994) . The final cleavage event of P23 produces fully mature nsPs and switches the RNA template for synthesis of positive sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs. The correlation between P23 cleavage and the change from negative to positive sense RNA production is poorly defined. The P23 cleavage site is located at the base of a narrow cleft and is not readily accessible, suggesting a highly regulated cleavage. Mutations in nsP2 or nsP3 near this cleavage site may alter viral replication and pathogenicity (Shin et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Most cytolytic animal viruses induce a profound decrease of cellular protein synthesis in infected cells, particularly during the late phase of infection (Bushell and Sarnow, 2002) . This is the case for SINV, which ablates cellular translation approximately 3 h after virus entry, while the protein-synthesizing machinery is preferentially dedicated to translate the viral sgmRNA Griffin, 2007) . Distinct mechanisms are responsible for the interference of cellular macromolecular synthesis by the different animal viruses. Alphaviruses induce the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in vertebrate cells, leading to an inhibition of host mRNA translation (McInerney et al., 2005) . However, infection of cells deficient in PKR (protein kinase activated by dsRNA), such as PKR \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by SINV also produces this blockade, despite the fact that no increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is observed (Gorchakov et al., 2004; Ventoso et al., 2006) . These observations suggest that SINV employs additional mechanisms, separate to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, to interfere with cellular protein synthesis. For example, the imbalance of ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm of infected cells, or the release of cellular proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm have been implicated as responsible for this inhibition (Garry et al., 1979; Garry, 1994; McInerney et al., 2005) . Analysis of a number of alphavirus nsP variants suggest that nsP2 is chiefly responsible for the inhibition of cellular macromolecular synthesis after viral infection (Gorchakov et al., 2004; Garmashova et al., 2006; Frolov et al., 2009) . Accordingly, SINV with a single nsP2 point mutation at proline 726 exhibits defects in host translational shut-off (Frolov et al., 1999) . The possibility that the translational efficiency and the quantity of subgenomic mRNA play a role in the inhibition of host protein synthesis has also been proposed (Patel et al., 2013) . Regardless, the cellular shut-off is efficiently induced by replicons lacking the coding region for the viral structural proteins (Frolov and Schlesinger, 1994; Sanz et al., 2007) . These observations are consistent with the concept that nsPs participate and are necessary to trigger shut-off of host protein synthesis. In the present work, we have analysed the expression of nsPs and their potential relationship with the inhibition of cellular mRNA translation. In addition, viral RNA replication and the redistribution of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm have been examined under restrictive conditions. Our findings suggest an association among these three phenomena: the blockade of host translation, the level of viral RNA replication and the redistribution of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Previous work demonstrated that replicons expressing only SINV nsPs have the ability to interfere with host translation (Frolov and Schlesinger, 1994; Sanz et al., 2007) . Moreover, SINV bearing mutations in nsP2 are defective in blocking cellular protein synthesis (Frolov et al., 1999) . Thus, we tested the activity of the individual expression of nsP1, nsP2 and nsP3, and expression of nsP1-4, on the endogenous translation of cellular mRNAs. In order to achieve high-level synthesis of nsPs, we used BHK-T7 cells that constitutively express the T7 RNA polymerase. This system has been employed successfully to express the precursors of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) nsPs (Spuul et al., 2011) . BHK-T7 cells were transfected with pTM1 plasmids containing the coding region for SINV nsPs downstream of the IRES element of encephalomyocarditis virus EMCV(IRES). As shown in Fig. 1A , cells transfected with pTM1-nsP1, pTM1-nsP2 or pTM1-nsP3 synthesized a new product that may correspond to the individual viral proteins. Both nsP1 and nsP3 were clearly detectable at 8 and 18 hpt, whereas nsP2 was synthesized at lower levels. However, the synthesis of new proteins was not evident by radioactive labelling after transfection of BHK-T7 cells with pTM1-nsP1-4. We employed poliovirus 2A protease (PV 2A pro ) as a positive control as it is a viral protein that profoundly inhibits cellular translation, while the expression of PV 2C was employed as a negative control as it is a viral protein that does not directly affect cellular protein synthesis (Redondo et al., 2011) . Densitometric analysis of cellular actin revealed that PV 2A pro inhibited its synthesis by more than 90% at 8 hpt, suggesting that transfection of BHK-T7 cells was very efficient ( Fig. 1A and B). In contrast, inhibition of cellular actin synthesis was 39% by expression of PV 2C. This partial blockade of cellular translation by PV 2C at 8 hpt may be due to the efficient transcription of this plasmid followed by translation of the corresponding mRNA. Additionally, BHK cells expressing nsP2, nsP3 or nsP1-4 exhibited an inhibition of actin synthesis similar to that observed with PV 2C (34, 48 and 42%, respectively) at 8 hpt ( Fig. 1A and B) . Expression of nsP1, which is very efficient at this time, provoked a 72% decrease in actin synthesis. Strikingly, when the synthesis of cellular actin was measured at 18 hpt, PV 2A pro still blocked its production by 95%, whereas PV 2C showed no inhibition (3%) at this time. Reduced blockade of cellular protein synthesis was also observed with the SINV nsPs, including protein nsP1, which caused an inhibition of 24% at this time. Collectively, these results show that individual expression of SINV nsPs does not abrogate cellular translation to the extent shown by a genuine inducer of the shut-off of host translation, PV 2A pro . The partial inhibition detected at 8 hpt by SINV nsPs might be due to the high efficiency of transcription and translation of this system, which decreases after prolonged incubation (18 hpt), rather than to the activity of the SINV proteins on the translational machinery. If one individual nsP was responsible for the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, we would expect that after prolonged synthesis (18 hpt), this inhibition would be cumulative, but rather, we observed that the blockade of cellular translation declines with time.",

In addition, expression of PV 2A pro decreases endogenous cellular protein synthesis resulting in a more prominent and clear synthesis of proteins from pTM1 in this system, thus facilitating their detection. Strikingly, transfection of pTM1-nsP1-4 in cells previously transfected with pTM1-2A resulted in the appearance of protein species that corresponded to precursor and mature nsPs (Supporting Information Fig. S1A ). Moreover, the synthesis of nsP1, nsP2 and nsP3 was more clearly distinguished when PV 2A pro was present. Consistent with these results obtained in cultured cells, in vitro transcription/translation of the corresponding plasmids in rabbit reticulocyte lysates rendered proteins with the expected molecular mass (Supporting Information Fig. S1B ). In the case of nsP1-4 mRNA, different products were produced because of the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein, rendering a variety of proteolytic precursors and mature proteins.",

As these proteins were recognized by the specific antibodies and migrated similarly as in infected cells (Fig. 1C) , we can conclude that genuine nsP1, nsP2 and nsP4 are being synthesized using the T7-expressing system. Moreover, nsP1 or nsP2 were produced at higher levels at 8 hpt when compared with that observed during virus infection at 8 hpi. Further, as shown in the labelling experiments (Fig. 1A) , the level of nsP3 synthesis should be much greater in this system relative to infected cells, where nsPs cannot be directly detected by radioactive labelling.

            "text": "In order to assess whether the nsPs synthesized after plasmid transfection of pTM1-nsP1-4 were active and functional in viral RNA replication, we performed a complementation assay with a SINV replicon that lacks the majority of the nsP-coding region. This plasmid contains luciferase (luc) as a reporter placed after the coding region of the capsid protein (C) (see scheme of rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) in Fig. 2A ). Two different complementation approaches were used: in the first approach, two plasmids (pT7-rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and pTM1-nsP1-4) were co-transfected; in the second approach, we cotransfected two RNAs obtained by in vitro transcription of the plasmids, rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4. Viral RNA replication can be complemented in trans in BHK-T7 cells transfected with plasmids encoding SFV nsPs (Spuul et al., 2011) ; however, in that study, transfections of DNA plasmids or RNA replicons were not compared. Transfection of DNA plasmid pT7-rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) alone produced virtually no luc activity, whereas co-transfection with pTM1-nsP1-4 induced significant luc synthesis (Fig. 2B) . Presumably, in these cells, the T7 RNA polymerase synthesizes mRNAs EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 and rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and the complementation occurs (as indicated in Fig. 2A) . Notably, co-transfection of these mRNAs previously obtained by in vitro transcription led to a much greater production of luc ( Fig. 2B ). This result is of interest as it indicates that the mRNA EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 synthesized produces precursor and mature proteins that are active in SINV RNA replication and the subsequent transcription of the sgmRNA. Further, it indicates that complementation of the defective replicon rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) is approximately 10-15-fold more efficient when transcribed RNAs are transfected relative to plasmid transfection. Of note, a low level of luc synthesis occurred when capped RNA rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) was transfected alone (Fig. 2B ). This activity may correspond to the inefficient translation of the second cistron (C+luc) present in this RNA, perhaps after ribosome reinitiation on this cistron. In addition, we measured luc activity from cells co-transfected with rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and a non-defective replicon, rep-26S, which gives rise to all functional nsPs. In this way, the effectiveness of complementation of EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 RNA was compared with that obtained with the replicon rep-26S. Complementation in trans by nsPs derived from EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 is similar to that obtained with rep-26S (Fig. 2B ). This suggests that the proteins synthesized from EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 mRNA are as functional as those derived from the replicon rep-26S. Both types of complementation in trans yield up to 90% less luc activity than rep C+luc (Fig. 2B ). As the expression of nsPs had little effect on cellular translation ( Fig. 1) , we wondered whether the expression of these proteins together with the replication of a viral RNA upon complementation could induce an inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. To this end, we examined protein synthesis in BHK cells with nsPs complementing rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) (Fig. 2C ). BHK cells were transfected with EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 mRNA, with rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) or with both combined. As controls for this assay, we used rep C+luc and rep-26S, which renders a minimal sgmRNA with the 5\u2032UTR sequence but without the sequence for structural proteins. At 7 hpt, cells were labelled with [ 35 S]Met/Cys for 30 min. As expected, a strong inhibition of cellular translation was observed in cells transfected with rep C+luc or rep-26S, whereas cellular protein synthesis persisted in cells transfected with EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 or with rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) ( Fig. 2C and D). Interestingly, protein synthesis also continued B. BHK-T7 cells previously seeded on 24-well plates were transfected with XhoI-linearized pT7-rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) plasmid only (0.4 \u03bcg) or co-transfected with pTM1-nsP1-4 (0.4 \u03bcg). In parallel, cells were transfected with the in vitro obtained mRNA rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) (2.5 \u03bcg) or co-transfected with this mRNA (2.5 \u03bcg) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 (2.5 \u03bcg). Cells were also co-transfected with rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) (2.5 \u03bcg) and rep-26S (2.5 \u03bcg) or transfected only with rep C+luc (2.5 \u03bcg). At 4 and 8 hpt, cells were harvested and luc activity was determined. Luc activity results are displayed as means \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. C. BHK cells previously seeded on 24-well plates were transfected with the different mRNAs (5 \u03bcg per well) obtained by in vitro transcription, and at 7 hpt protein synthesis was analysed by incorporation of [ 35 S]Met/Cys for 30 min followed by SDS-PAGE, fluorography and autoradiography. Asterisks indicate C and luc proteins. D. The percentage values of actin protein synthesis in transfected cells compared with mock-transfected cells were calculated by densitometric scanning and are represented as means \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. E. BHK cells previously seeded on 24-well plates were transfected with 2.5 \u03bcg of each mRNA or co-tranfected with 2.5 \u03bcg EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 and 2.5 \u03bcg rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and treated with [ 3 H]Uridine in the presence of actinomycin D from 3 to 7 hpt. Then, total RNA was extracted and analysed by electrophoresis in denaturing gels, fluorography and autoradiography as indicated in Materials and methods. F. Samples obtained in panel C were used in immunoblot analyses with anti-nsp1, anti-nsp2 or anti-C antibodies. The sample corresponding to rep C+luc was diluted 10-fold in the analysis of C. Anti-EF2 was used as a loading control. Host translation shut-off by SINV 525 unabated in cells co-transfected with EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 and rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs). This result suggests that the replication of this defective SINV replicon after complementation with nsPs is not sufficient to abrogate cellular translation. In a parallel experiment, the synthesis of viral RNA was studied in cells transfected with the different RNAs described above. To do this, transfected cells were incubated with [ 3 H]Uridine from 3 to 7 hpt in the presence of 2.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 actinomycin D. Results showed that cells transfected with rep C+luc or rep-26S synthesized genomic or subgenomic RNAs (Fig. 2E ). In contrast, no viral RNAs were detected in cells co-transfected with EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 and rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs), suggesting that although complementation can be demonstrated through measurement of luc activity, the production of RNA is below the threshold of detection. Nevertheless, the synthesis of C protein can be observed by immunoblotting in co-transfected cells (Fig. 2F) , although the level of this protein is approximately 100-fold lower relative to cells transfected with rep C+luc. In conclusion, this low RNA replication rate has no consequences for the blockade of host translation.",

            "text": "Infection of mammalian cells by a variety of animal viruses induces the formation of SGs containing some nuclear proteins that are released to the cytoplasm (Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2012) . Alphavirus infection elicits the release of T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA-1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, giving rise to the transient accumulation of SGs (Panas et al., 2012; Garcia-Moreno et al., 2013) . Interestingly, the release of some nuclear proteins by SFV infection, such as TIA-1, has been involved in the shut-off of host translation (McInerney et al., 2005) . In addition to TIA-1, other nuclear proteins appear in the cytoplasm after SINV infection, including hnRNP K, hnRNP A1 and HuR proteins (Burnham et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2009; Gui et al., 2010; Dickson et al., 2012) . Thus, initially, we decided to examine if two nuclear proteins, TIA-1 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), changed their cellular distribution in SINV-infected BHK cells and in cells transfected with the SINV replicon. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein is a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein that is involved in a number of diverse cellular functions including splicing regulation, polyadenylation and viral mRNA translation (Sawicka et al., 2008) . This protein is released from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in picornavirus and coronavirus-infected cells (Back et al., 2002; Borghese and Michiels, 2011; Sola et al., 2011) ; to our knowledge, redistribution of PTB has not been examined in alphavirus-infected cells. To this end, BHK cells were infected with SINV or transfected with replicon rep C+luc and at 5 or 7 hpt, respectively, the subcellular distribution of TIA-1 and PTB was analysed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3) . Clearly, these proteins have a preferential nuclear localization in uninfected BHK cells, whereas they were released from nucleus to cytoplasm both in infected and in transfected cells. Densitometric analysis of the TIA-1 signal indicated that in uninfected cells, approximately 55-60% of the total amount of TIA-1was present in the nucleus. However, both in infected cells and in cells transfected with rep C+luc TIA-1 accumulated over 82-90% in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) . Similar results were obtained whit PTB that exhibited a nuclear level of 75-80% in mockinfected BHK cells, whereas this amount was reduced to 11-15% in infected cells and 11-18% in rep C+luctransfected cells (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, there is a correlation between SINV replication and the release of proteins from nucleus to cytoplasm. Next, we wished to examine the release of nuclear proteins in cells co-transfected with rep C+luc (\u0394nsPs) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 compared with cells transfected with rep C+luc (Figs 4A and B). As shown above, although inefficiently, viral replication can be induced by transcomplementation. The presence of luc tested with specific antibodies indicates SINV RNA replication, transcription of the sgmRNA C+luc and subsequent translation to produce luc in transfected cells. In cells transfected with rep C+luc, a clear re-localization of TIA-1 to the cytoplasm was observed in cells synthesizing luc whereas it largely remained nuclear in cells co-transfected with rep C+luc (\u0394nsPs) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4, even in cells with conspicuous luc production (Fig. 4A) . Thus, in rep C+luc-transfected cells, the nuclear signal for TIA-1 related to mock-transfected cells drops by 74-80% and in cells co-transfected with rep C+luc (\u0394nsPs) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 diminishes only by 2-6%. Similar results were obtained with PTB (Fig. 4B ). The immunofluorescence signal associated to PTB into the nucleus of cells transfected with rep C+luc drops by 70-75% as compared to mock-transfected cells, but in cells co-transfected with rep C+luc (\u0394nsPs) plus EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 decreases only by 1-4%. These observations are consistent with the idea that a correlation exists between the level of viral RNA replication, the redistribution of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins as TIA-1 or PTB to the cytoplasm and the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis.",

Thus, this SINV variant was not entirely defective in its ability to interfere with cellular protein synthesis. Next, the synthesis of viral RNAs was assayed by [ 3 H]Uridine incorporation in the presence of 2.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 actinomycin D from 3 to 8 hpt. Compared with SINV wt, there was a significant reduction in the synthesis of viral RNAs, such that the amount of gmRNA SINV (P726G) was 4% of control, while the amount of sgmRNA was approximately 10% compared with control ( Fig. 5C and D). Curiously, production of nsP1 measured by immunoblot was 47% compared with control cells transfected with SINV wt gmRNA ( Fig. 5E and F) , whereas the synthesis of C at 4 and 8 hpt was 83% and 75% of control respectively ( Fig. 5A and B) . Therefore, it appears that there is no correlation between the synthesis of viral mRNAs and the quantity of viral proteins synthesized. In conclusion, the major defect exhibited by this SINV variant is in the synthesis of viral RNAs, whereas viral proteins are still synthesized, although to a lower extent. Our next aim was to analyse the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm in cells transfected with gmRNA from SINV wt or SINV nsP2 (P726G) (Fig. 6A and B) . Sindbis virus-replicating cells were detected by immunofluorescence of proteins C and nsP1. The redistribution of TIA-1, PTB and additionally redox factor-1 (Ref-1) was examined. Of note, SINV wt induced the release of both TIA-1 and PTB to the cytoplasm at 7 hpt to a similar extent as with the replicon rep C+luc described above, although",

BHK cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with in vitro synthesized mRNA (1 \u03bcg per well) from pT7SVwt (A) or pT7SV(P726G) (B). At 7 hpt, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Rabbit anti-C antibodies were used to detect SINV-replicating cells (green) and goat anti-TIA-1 or mouse monoclonal anti-PTB antibodies to detect the subcellular location of these proteins (red). Alternatively, rat anti-nsp1 antibodies were used to detect SINV-replicating cells (green) and rabbit anti-Ref-1 antibodies to detect the subcellular location of Ref-1 (red). Topro-3 was used to stain nuclei (blue). Yellow and white arrows indicate the nuclei of transfected and untransfected cells respectively. with more variability between individual cells. This may be due to different viral replication levels in the different cells as a consequence of secondary infections propitiated by viruses produced in the transfected cells (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, Ref-1 preserved its nuclear localization by about 90-96% in cells that produced nsP1 as related to uninfected cells, indicating that clearly not all nuclear proteins are redistributed to the cytoplasm in SINV-replicating cells. Interestingly, the SINV nsP2 variant (P726G) had little effect on the redistribution of nuclear proteins TIA-1, PTB and Ref-1 (Fig. 6B) . Thus, the signal of TIA-1 at the nucleus of these cells reaches 88-93% of that of uninfected cells and similar values were obtained for PTB (86-93%) and Ref-1 (91-96%). Transfected cells were also evaluated at 24 hpt (Supporting Information Fig. S3 ). At this time, cells transfected with gmRNA from SINV wt showed clear signs of an infection-associated cytopathic response. This was not apparent in SINV nsP2 (P726G) transfected cells, which did not show changes in the pattern of distribution of TIA-1 or PTB. Therefore, in SINV nsP2 (P726G)-replicating BHK cells, a correlation exists between the inhibition of viral RNA replication and the release of nuclear proteins, in addition to the failure to completely block cellular mRNA translation.",

To this end, two nucleoside analogues, 6-aza-uridine and ribavirin, which interfere with the metabolism of nucleosides and nucleotides and have detrimental effects on both cellular and viral RNA synthesis, were employed to inhibit viral replication (Carrasco and Vazquez, 1984; Vignuzzi et al., 2005) . BHK cells were infected with SINV for 1 h to allow virus entry, and then the medium was exchanged with addition of inhibitors. This protocol avoids the potential inhibitory effects of nucleoside analogues on virus attachment and entry. Protein synthesis was estimated at 5 hpi. As observed in Fig. 7A , increasing concentrations of 6-azauridine and ribavirin led to a partial decline of protein synthesis in uninfected BHK cells. Densitometric measurements indicated that cellular actin represented 60% of control at 0.5 mM 6-aza-uridine and 74% at 0.2 mM ribavirin (Fig. 7B ). Under these conditions, SINV infection does not intensify the inhibition of actin synthesis. In SINV-infected BHK cells, actin synthesis was blocked by 97% in the absence of inhibitors. Conversely, the decrease of actin synthesis was 8% in SINV-infected cells, relative to uninfected BHK cells, in the presence of 0.5 mM 6-aza-uridine, whereas the blockade of actin syn-thesis was 18% in SINV-infected cells incubated with 0.2 mM ribavirin ( Fig. 7A and B) . As a control, we also tested the inhibitory effect of actinomycin D that potently blocks cellular RNA synthesis but has almost no effect on the synthesis of SINV RNAs. As expected, actinomycin D treatment from 0 to 5 hpi had little effect on protein synthesis both in infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 7A) .",

Predictably, actinomycin D inhibited cellular RNA synthesis only (Fig. 7C) . Additionally, the production of nsPs and sPs were measured in treated and untreated infected cells by immunoblotting. As noted previously, and also in several reports, there was no correlation between the level of mRNA and the production of viral proteins ( Fig. 7C and D) . Accordingly, the production of nsP2 in ribavirin-treated cells decreased proportionately less than the production of gmRNA. Similarly, in ribavirin-treated cells, synthesis of C and E1 glycoproteins decreased less than synthesis of sgmRNA ( Fig. 7C and D) .

Whereas treatment of control-uninfected BHK cells with these compounds had no effect in the redistribution of PTB or TIA-1, both inhibitors blocked the release of PTB to the cytoplasm in SINV-infected cells (Fig. 8) . The nuclear signal of PTB in infected cells treated with 6-aza-uridine varies between 63% and 72% of total signal, while it ranged between 11% and 16% in infected untreated cells. Similarly, ribavirin treatment led to PTB retention in the nucleus (65-72% of total signal). Moreover, treatment with nucleoside analogues also reduced the accumulation of TIA-1 in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Supporting Information Fig. S4 ). Thus, in agreement with previous results, these findings indicate that the shutoff of host translation after SINV infection is restricted when viral RNA synthesis is blocked and nuclear proteins are not released to the cytoplasm.",

Thus, it was important to analyse whether the nucleoside analogues prevented eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, and whether this was the principal reason for the lack of shut-off of host translation observed in BHK cells. To this end, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis were examined in BHK cells treated with 0.5 mM 6-aza-uridine or 0.2 mM ribavirin ( Fig. 9A and B) . As anticipated, SINV infection of BHK cells induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig. 9A , lower panel). Interestingly, ribavirin largely prevented eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, whereas this prevention was only partial in 6-aza-uridine-treated cells (Fig. 9A, lower panel) . We reasoned that the prevention of the shut-off of host translation by the nucleoside analogues in BHK cells may be due to their interference with eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.",

            "text": "To test this, we used PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs that do not undergo eIF2 inactivation following SINV infection (Ventoso et al., 2006) . Indeed, no phosphorylation of the eIF2 \u03b1 subunit was evident in SINV-infected PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. 9C , lower panel). Similar to previous results, inhibition of protein synthesis by 0.5 mM 6-aza-uridine or 0.2 mM ribavirin was 33% and 46%, respectively, in uninfected cells ( Fig. 9C and D) . Notably, treatment with the nucleoside analogues prevented the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by SINV infection even when no phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 took place; in the presence of 0.5 mM 6-azauridine, SINV infection inhibited actin synthesis by 3%, related to 6-aza-uridine-treated uninfected cells, whereas this inhibition was 10% with ribavirin. In contrast, the decrease in actin synthesis was 95% in untreated PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs after SINV infection related to untreated and uninfected cells (Fig. 9C and D) . Next, we assessed the location of PTB in PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs infected with SINV. Consistent with the results obtained in BHK cells, a potent release of PTB occurred in PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs infected with SINV containing less than 15% of PTB 8 . Release of PTB in SINV-infected BHK cells treated with 6-aza-uridine or ribavirin. Mock and SINV-infected BHK cells (1 pfu cell \u22121 ) were treated with 0.5 mM 6-aza-uridine, 0.2 mM ribavirin or left untreated; at 5 hpi, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Rabbit anti-C antibodies were used to detect SINV-infected cells (green) and mouse monoclonal anti-PTB antibodies to detect the subcellular location of this protein (red). Topro-3 was used to stain the nuclei (blue). Yellow and white arrows indicate the nuclei of infected and uninfected cells respectively. in the nucleus of infected cells. However, in infected cells treated with nucleoside analogues around 68-72% of PTB remained into the nucleus (Fig. 9E) . Thus, the inability of SINV to induce shut-off in the presence of 6-azauridine or ribavirin is not related to the prevention of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Finally, we tested shut-off of host translation in PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs infected with the SINV nsP2 variant (P726G). Cells were transfected with in vitro synthesized gmRNAs from SINV wt or SINV nsP2 (P726G) and protein synthesis was estimated at 4 and 8 hpt. Compared with SINV wt, virtually no inhibition of cellular translation was observed in PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs after infection with the SINV variant ( Fig. 10A and B) , suggesting that the partial inhibition observed in BHK cells (Fig. 5A ) may be due to the presence of PKR in these cells. Further, in agreement with the results obtained in BHK cells, TIA-1 and PTB accumulated in the cytoplasm of SINV wt gmRNA-transfected cells, and their nuclear location was unchanged after transfection of SINV nsP2 (P726G) (Fig. 10C) . Taken together, these results support an association between the shut-off of host translation and the exit of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm. Additionally, the prevention of SINV-induced cellular protein synthesis blockade by nucleoside analogues or the SINV variant nsP2 (P726G), is more clearly observed in PKR-defective cells.",

Alphavirus replicons encoding solely nsPs interfere with cellular translation to a degree similar to that observed with non-defective viruses (Frolov and Schlesinger, 1994; Sanz et al., 2007) . Several observations point to nsP2 as the mediator of these inhibitory effects (Frolov et al., 1999; Gorchakov et al., 2004; Garmashova et al., 2006). However, a mutant in the 5\u2032UTR sequence of sgmRNA of SINV that expresses more nsPs than wt virus is defective in the shut-off of host mRNA translation (Patel et al., 2013) . We have analysed the inhibition of cellular mRNA translation mediated by individual nsPs and nsP1-4. We found that individual expression of nsP1, nsP2 and nsP3 or nsP1-4 has little effect on cellular protein synthesis. In the case of nsP1-4, not only mature nsPs are synthesized, but also their precursors, which is more akin to the situation observed in SINV-infected cells.",

            "text": "Our results are consistent with the idea that inhibition of host translation in alphavirus-infected mammalian cells requires a high level of viral RNA replication. Indeed, in cells co-transfected with rep C+luc(\u0394nsPs) and EMCV(IRES)-nsP1-4 mRNA, there is low-level RNA replication, no release of nuclear proteins and the synthesis of cellular proteins is not blocked. A similar situation arises for the variant SINV nsP2 (P726G), which has little effect on cellular mRNA translation, particularly in PKR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs, concomitant with a low level of viral RNA replication. Analogous to SINV nsP2 (P726G), two variants of SFV with point mutations in nsP2 that severely reduce the levels of viral RNA accumulation, were also unable to induce shut-off (Tamm et al., 2008) . Notably, this inhibition of host protein synthesis is prevented with nucleoside analogues that diminish viral RNA synthesis. These nucleoside analogues inhibit cellular transcription to a similar extent as actinomycin D, but additionally block viral transcription. Actinomycin D treatment does not impede the process of cellular shut-off in SINV-infected cells, whereas 6-aza-uridine or ribavirin prevents this. Further support for this notion stems from the observation that SINV infection of mosquito cells, which results in low levels of viral RNA replication, does not abolish protein synthesis (Kim et al., 2004) . In conclusion, for the shut-off of host mRNA translation to take place, synthesis of SINV nsPs is not sufficient and viral RNA replication is necessary. This replication should have to take place at normal levels, because no inhibition of host translation occurs when viral RNA replication is compromised. Notably, shutoff of cellular protein synthesis coincides with release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and efficient viral RNA replication. This viral replication might trigger a cellular response that obstructs the shuttling of proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm. Therefore, it could be possible that one or more nuclear proteins are inhibitory for cellular translation when they are present in the cytoplasm. Of note, a number of nuclear proteins are released to the cytoplasm in various animal viruses studied (Li and Nagy, 2011) . In the case of SINV, hnRNP K protein can be found enriched in membranous fractions containing SINV replication complexes, interacting with sgmRNA (Burnham et al., 2007) . Also, hnRNP A1 can bind to the 5\u2032-UTR of SINV genomic RNA and facilitates translation (Lin et al., 2009; Gui et al., 2010) . HuR protein also relocalizes to the cytoplasm after alphavirus infection (Dickson et al., 2012) and interacts with a U-rich element in the 3\u2032-UTR of SINV transcripts, mediating viral RNA stabilization (Garneau et al., 2008; Sokoloski et al., 2010) . Recently, it was proposed that the 3\u2032-UTR of SINV serves as a sponge for HuR contributing to disrupt cellular posttranscriptional control (Barnhart et al., 2013) . In addition, PTB interacts with coronavirus RNAs and negatively affects the production of viral RNA (Sola et al., 2011) . Also, several hnRNPs and other nuclear proteins have been located in the antiviral granules formed as an innate host response to combat poxvirus infection (Rozelle et al., 2014) . When MEFs defective in TIA-1 are infected with SFV, the shutoff of host translation was significantly delayed as compared with control MEFs (McInerney et al., 2005) . Undoubtedly, there are a large number of shuttling proteins that could be involved in the inhibition of cellular translation that remain to be studied.",

            "text": "The replication of viral genomes in the cytoplasm of infected cells is associated with profound rearrangements of cellular membranes. There are several possible explanations that might account for the connection between inhibition of host translation, viral RNA replication and the redistribution of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm. One such possibility is that the appearance of large quantities of viral sequences in the cytoplasm induces a redistribution of nuclear proteins (Barnhart et al., 2013) . Another possibility is that viral RNA replication itself induces this release, as this phenomenon is coupled to the rearrangement of intracellular membranes (Kujala et al., 2001; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . This rearrangement can distort the shuttling of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the case of alphaviruses, the replication complexes are associated with newly formed membranous structures named spherules (Kujala et al., 2001; Spuul et al., 2011) . These spherules are connected to the cytoplasm by a narrow neck, through which the synthesized viral RNAs can be delivered. Expression of SFV nsPs in the absence of RNA replication does not induce formation of these structures. Indeed, the size of these spherules is dependent on the length of the replicative viral RNA (Kallio et al., 2013) . If the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis is due to the increase of nuclear proteins in the cytoplasm, a number of new questions arise: (i) which nuclear proteins are able to block cellular mRNA translation?; (ii) why is this inhibition selective for cellular versus viral mRNA?;",

Although the inhibition of host mRNA translation can take place by redundant mechanisms, such as redistribution of nuclear proteins, modification of eIFs, ionic imbalance or mRNA competition, it is possible that one of the most important factors to explain this event is the re-localization of nuclear proteins. Future work along this line will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms employed by alphaviruses and other animal viruses to interfere with cellular functions and with innate antiviral responses.",
