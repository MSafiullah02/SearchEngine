A large family of these virus are causing different kind diseases such as cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The new addition to coronavirus family COVID-19 is discovered in 2019, which has never been detected in humans. COVID-19 is known as zoonotic disease because it is transferred from animal to human such as bat 4 , similar to SARS-CoV virus which is contaminated through cat and MERS-CoV from dromedary 5 . It is presumed that respiratory transmission and physical contact is cause to spread COVID-19 rapidly.
