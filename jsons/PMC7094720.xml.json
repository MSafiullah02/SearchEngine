            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a central role in the vertebrate immune system. MHC genes encode two major classes of transmembrane glycoproteins consisting of two chains, \u03b1 and \u03b2. MHC class I genes are expressed in almost all nucleated somatic cells, whereas MHC class II genes are confined to antigen-presenting cells of the immune system (Klein, 1986). Although this general function of the MHC is conserved among vertebrates, the genetic architecture of the MHC can differ within and between vertebrate classes (recently reviewed in Kelley et al., 2005). Gene duplication occurred frequently, and thus the number of classes I and II loci can substantially vary between species (Kelley et al., 2005; Nei and Rooney, 2005). In mammals, the genetic diversity at various MHC loci has been studied in several species of all major mammalian orders except for the second largest order Chiroptera that comprise more than 1000 species worldwide (Simmons, 2006). Bats and flying foxes are of particular immunological interest, because they are hosts of viruses pathogenic to humans including rabies (Fooks et al., 2003; Cliquet and Picard-Meyer, 2004), Ebola (Leroy et al., 2005), SARS-like viruses (Li et al., 2005), and Nipah and Hendra viruses (Wong et al., 2007).",

            "text": "MHC genes are the most variable genes described in vertebrates. Up to 499 alleles were described at the human MHC locus HLA-B (Garrigan and Hedrick, 2003). Highest levels of nucleotide diversity are found in regions containing antigen-binding sites (ABS) and patterns of nucleotide substitutions deviate from neutral evolution expectation in almost all studies. Some form of balancing selection best explains the enormous diversity of certain MHC genes (Hedrick and Thomson, 1983), and two major mutually nonexclusive mechanisms of pathogen-driven selection have been proposed to explain this pattern. First, the frequency-dependent selection hypothesis or the rare allele advantage (Clarke and Kirby, 1966) predicts that rare alleles can have a selective advantage as parasites will adapt to common host alleles. Since an advantageous allele will increase in frequency, parasites resistant to this allele will be favoured. Negative frequency-dependent selection models of host\u2013parasite coevolution showed that a large number of alleles can be retained (Borghans et al., 2004). The spatial and rapid temporal variation in frequency of MHC alleles and resistance provides evidence for frequency-dependent selection (Hill et al., 1994; Westerdahl et al., 2004; Charbonnel and Pemberton, 2005). Second, the overdominance or heterozygote advantage hypothesis (Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1975) assumes that heterozygous individuals have a higher average fitness, because individuals being heterozygous at the antigen-binding region can present a wider array of antigens than homozygous individuals. Therefore, heterozyotes are expected to be more resistant against pathogens than homozygotes. An overdominance effect was shown in mice that were coinfected with Salmonella enterica and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (McClelland et al., 2003). Distinguishing between the frequency-dependent selection and the heterozygote advantage hypothesis is difficult, because both models require a correlation between parasites and particular MHC alleles. Meanwhile, such relationships were found in several species including many non-model organisms (Table 1 in Sommer, 2005). The evolutionary ecology of the MHC was recently summarized in several reviews (Bernatchez and Landry, 2003; Garrigan and Hedrick, 2003; Sommer, 2005; Piertney and Oliver, 2006).",

The two B sequence types do not share a sequence fragment with each other. Only the sequence type B2 has a short sequence fragment in common with the A4 allele.

            "text": "Recombination between alleles (intragenic recombination) or between loci (intergenic recombination) can rapidly generate allelic diversity at MHC class II genes (Andersson and Mikko, 1995). Our study provides further evidence for the significance of recombination in generating allelic diversity of MHC class II genes. Several DRB1 alleles of the sac-winged bat shared different sequence motifs with different alleles (Figure 1). In contrast, the two B sequence types, which are likely encoded by another locus, did not share long-sequence fragments with DRB1 alleles. This suggests that intragenic recombination of the DRB1 locus and less intergenic recombination plays an important role in generating allelic diversity at the DRB1 locus of the sac-winged bat. Despite the lack of clear evidence for intergenic recombination we are not able to rule it out, because we might have missed to amplify paralog DRB loci possibly involved in intergenic recombination. Methodological artefacts, like recombination during PCR, can be ruled out because recombined alleles were independently detected in several individuals. Several recent studies on genetic diversity of MHC class II genes documented intragenic recombination (human HLA-DPB1: Zangenberg et al., 1995; deer mouse EB: Richman et al., 2003; chamois DRB: Schaschl et al., 2005; stickleback MHC class IIB genes: Reusch and Langefors, 2005). Usually only short-sequence motifs are shared among alleles. In contrast, shared sequence fragments are rather long in the sac-winged bat. A similar pattern of shared sequence fragments among alleles was observed by Zangenberg et al. (1995), who studied the rate of evolution within the exon 2 of the human HLA-DPB1 locus by screening pools of sperm. The similarity between this sperm analysis study and our study suggests that some recombination events among DRB1 alleles in the sac-winged bat occurred rather recently. This is further supported by the lack of nucleotide substitutions between some DNA sequence fragments that are shared by two alleles (Figure 1).",

The comparison of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS) revealed contrasting results between sites involved in ABS and non-ABS. At ABS, nonsynonymous mutations were 2.4 times more frequent than synonymous mutations, whereas this was not the case for non-ABS. In addition, ABSs were more variable than non-ABSs. The proportion of polymorph ABS was significantly higher than that of non-ABS; and at the protein level, amino-acid sites involved in antigen binding showed higher levels of heterozygosity than nonantigen-binding amino acid sites. The dN/dS test is most commonly used in MHC studies to infer a possible role of balancing selection. In 47 of 48 studies, the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions exceeded the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS>1) (Bernatchez and Landry, 2003), and thus our study on the sac-winged bat is in line with these studies.",

            "text": "Whether balancing selection occurred over the history of the species and whether it still acts in contemporary populations can be tested by different approaches (Garrigan and Hedrick, 2003). The nucleotide sequence of the 11 alleles differed substantially (mean 14.2%). This is in accordance with balancing selection in the past, which can maintain particular haplotype lineages for a long evolutionary period. Therefore, despite the important role of balancing selection for maintaining allelic diversity for a long evolutionary time, its contemporary role remains unclear. Our data do not support ongoing balancing selection at least not within our local population of sac-winged bats from the biological station La Selva. We neither found evidence for heterozygote excess nor did the Ewens\u2013Watterson test reveal a deviation of heterozygosity from a neutral equilibrium distribution. Instead the Hardy\u2013Weinberg\u2013Exact Test on heterozygote deficiency revealed an almost significant result due to an increased proportion of homozygotes of the most common allele. This trend is in contrast to the expectation of ongoing balancing selection due to a heterozygote advantage (Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1975). However, detection of selection from heterozygote excess has low power. Small deme size itself leads to heterozygote excess (Pudovkin et al., 1996; Luikart and Cornuet, 1999; Balloux, 2004) and cryptic population structure could cause homozygote excess. Thus, one would need a comparative study with other markers to see if observed excess was itself in excess of a heterozygote or homozygote excess at other loci.",

They are characterized by a small number of alleles with allele frequencies not exceeding 50% in polymorphic populations (Sena et al., 2003; Aguilar et al., 2004; Amills et al., 2004; Weber et al., 2004). In contrast, in the sac-winged bat, a single-frequent allele (A1) occurred at a frequency of 80% that caused the low heterozygosity. The nine remaining alleles had a frequency of 5% or less. Such a high frequency of a single allele can be the result of genetic drift and is unexpected if heterozygotes (Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1975) or rare alleles (Clarke and Kirby, 1966) have an advantage.",

An excess of a particular homozygous genotype is expected, if individuals with this genotype have higher fitness, for example, by having a higher chance of survival. One possibility is pathogen-driven selection that was recently shown for a number of wild populations of several species. Particular alleles were significantly increased in frequency in individuals, infected by a particular pathogen compared to uninfected individuals (reviewed in Bernatchez and Landry, 2003; Piertney and Oliver, 2006). For example, the frequency of one allele differed by the factor of more than two between nematode infected and uninfected striped mice Rhabdomys pumilio (Froeschke and Sommer, 2005). The high frequency of the A1 allele in the sac-winged bat could be a result of positive selection by an unknown pathogen that invaded our study population. This remains purely speculative at the moment, as we do not have information on the infection of sac-winged bats by parasites. Even when positive selection occurs, allelic diversity can be maintained due to immigrant individuals from other populations, if these populations experience different selection pressures. The analysis of bats from other localities and of neutrally evolving sequence regions close to the DRB locus will give some further insights (Garrigan and Hedrick, 2003; Charlesworth, 2006).",
