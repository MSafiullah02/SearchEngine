Nevertheless, the cDNA sequence has not been formally published. Although sequence of PoIFN-\u03b3 gene was reported and aligned with human IFN-\u03b3 gene to deduce the exon and intron structure (Dijkmans et al., 1990), little is known about the polymorphism of PoIFN-\u03b3 gene or cDNA. Human population studies have revealed several polymorphic sites in both intron and exon regions of human IFN-\u03b3 gene (Iwasaki et al., 2001, Tiroch et al., 2005). Two polymorphisms located in intron 1 of human IFN-\u03b3 gene were further shown to affect the production of IFN-\u03b3 (Pravica et al., 1999, Pravica et al., 2000), and which might influence either disease manifestation of IgA nephropathy (Schena et al., 2006), or the infection susceptibility to parvovirus B19 (Kerr et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Chong et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it remains to be explored whether any polymorphic sites in the coding region of IFN-\u03b3 gene may affect its protein activity.",

By employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), three cDNA clones of PoIFN-\u03b3 were isolated, respectively, from Duroc, Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and Landrance breeds. Nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of these three clones were aligned and compared with that of PoIFN-\u03b3 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990) to identify any polymorphic sites. Two PoIFN-\u03b3 cDNA variants were cloned, respectively, into pET32 vector for expressing rPoIFN-\u03b3 proteins. By performing a pseudorabies virus (PRV)-based plaque inhibition assay, we evaluated the antiviral activity of both rPoIFN-\u03b3 protein variants. Other activities of IFN-\u03b3, including antiproliferative effect on cells and stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production in porcine monocytes, were also assessed.",

Three cDNA clones, designated as PoIFN-\u03b3-W (pIFN-\u03b3-W), PoIFN-\u03b3-M (pIFN-\u03b3-M) and PoIFN-\u03b3-L (pIFN-\u03b3-L), were isolated, respectively, from Duroc, Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and Landrance breeds. These cDNA sequences were deposited to GenBank under accession numbers AY188090 (PoIFN-\u03b3-W), AY188089 (PoIFN-\u03b3-M), and DQ839398 (PoIFN-\u03b3-L). The sequence of PoIFN-\u03b3-W cDNA completely matches to the predicted coding sequence (CDS) of a previously reported PoIFN-\u03b3 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990). On the other hand, PoIFN-\u03b3-M clone has four nucleotide variations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), at nucleotide positions 269 (A/G), 376 (C/T), 426 (T/C), and 465 (T/C) of CDS (Fig. 1\n). Among these four SNPs, only the A269G polymorphism would change the coded amino acid sequence (Gln67Arg or Q67R). PoIFN-\u03b3-L clone has one SNP at position 251 (A/G), resulting in one amino acid replacement (Lys61Arg or K61R). Amino acid sequences of PoIFN-\u03b3-W, -M and -L variants were compared with that of other mammalian homologs, including bovine (M29867) (Cerretti et al., 1986), ovine (DQ410715) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), equine (D28520) (Curran et al., 1994), bottle-nosed dolphin (AB022044) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), human (BC070256) (Devos et al., 1982) and murine (K00083) (Gray and Goeddel, 1983) IFN-\u03b3. As shown in Fig. 2\n, all PoIFN-\u03b3 variants share higher amino acid identity to bovine (76.6% identity), ovine (77.8% identity), equine (70.1% identity) and bottle-nosed dolphin (tursiops) (80.2% identity) IFN-\u03b3 than to human (59.3% identity) and murine (39.1% identity) IFN-\u03b3. Both K61 and Q67 are conserved in the mammalian IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2). Six \u03b1-helical regions are assigned according to the structure of human IFN-\u03b3 (Ealick et al., 1991).",

The mature protein coding sequence of PoIFN-\u03b3-W and PoIFN-\u03b3-M cDNA was subcloned, respectively, into pET32 expression vector to generate bacterial expression constructs pETpIFN-\u03b3-W and pETpIFN-\u03b3-M.

A251G and A269G are located within exon 3 of PoIFN-\u03b3 gene at nucleotide positions 68 and 86 (Dijkmans et al., 1990). On the other hand, C376T, T426C and T465C are located within exon 4 of PoIFN-\u03b3 gene at nucleotide positions 10, 60 and 99 (Dijkmans et al., 1990). Four SNPs detected in PoIFN-\u03b3-M (Landrance/Duroc) were absent in both PoIFN-\u03b3-W (Duroc) and PoIFN-\u03b3-L (Landrance), indicating that these SNPs may not be breed-specific. Allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms between Landrance and Duroc breeds, nevertheless, require further investigation. A269G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u03b3-M would change the coded amino acid sequence (Q67R). A251G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u03b3-L would also result in one amino acid replacement (K61R). Both K61 (within helix C) and Q67 (near helix D) are conserved in the mammalian IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2). However, we expect that the impact of K61R (PoIFN-\u03b3-L), a similar amino acid replacement, would be minor. On the other hand, Q67R that increases positive charge of the protein variant (PoIFN-\u03b3-M) could be a significant replacement. Consequently, in this study we expressed both PoIFN-\u03b3-M (R67) and PoIFN-\u03b3-W (Q67) variants to compare their biological activities. Interestingly, our results showed that Q67R could clearly inhibit antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u03b3 has been demonstrated in vitro on several swine viruses, including African swine fever (Esparza et al., 1988), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Charley et al., 1988), influenza virus (Horisberger, 1992), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Bautista and Molitor, 1999, Buddaert et al., 1998), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (Suradhat et al., 2001). All these viruses are RNA viruses that are highly sensitive to the antiviral mechanism of interferon. Instead of using RNA viruses, we evaluated the antiviral effect of PoIFN-\u03b3 on pseudorabies virus, a DNA virus. PRV, a swine alphaherpesvirus, is distantly related to the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Unlike HSV-1 that is well known for its anti-interferon mechanism, PRV lacks homologs of some anti-IFN genes (e.g. \u03b334.5 and Us11) of HSV-1 and the viral growth could be inhibited in IFN-\u03b2 treated PK-15 cells (Brukman and Enquist, 2006). The result of this study showed that PoIFN-\u03b3 inhibited PRV in a dose-dependent manner, although the dosage of IFN-\u03b3 used for PRV inhibition assay was higher than that for other RNA viruses. Therefore, we have established a PRV-based plaque inhibition assay to determine antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u03b3. Except for carrying an extra fusion peptide encoded by pET32 vector at N-terminus, the amino acid sequence of rPoIFN-\u03b3-W was identical to that of commercial rPoIFN-\u03b3 protein (Vandenbroeck et al., 1991). The fact that antiviral activities of rPoIFN-\u03b3-W and commercial rPoIFN-\u03b3 proteins were not significantly different indicated that the fusion peptide did not interfere with antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3. Results from plaque inhibition assay showed that rPoIFN-\u03b3-W presented a better antiviral activity than rPoIFN-\u03b3-M protein (P\n < 0.001). The missense polymorphism, Q67R, indeed has an impact on the biological activity of PoIFN-\u03b3-M protein, and this is the first report that identified a functional SNP in the coding region of IFN-\u03b3.",

This could be resulted from the interference of fusion peptide carried in rPoIFN-\u03b3-M and rPoIFN-\u03b3-W proteins. In addition to growth inhibition, activation of macrophage/monocyte is another important immunoregulatory activity of IFN-\u03b3. Measuring IFN-\u03b3-induced NO secretion in macrophages is a common bioassay for evaluating the activity of murine IFN-\u03b3 (Kim and Son, 1996, Malu et al., 2003). Instead of using macrophages, we measured PoIFN-\u03b3-induced NO secretion in porcine monocytes because peripheral monocytes were more easily obtained from pigs. Our result showed that, in response to PoIFN-\u03b3 stimulation, porcine peripheral monocytes produced NO in a dose-dependent manner. Nonetheless, induction levels of NO were not significantly different among monocytes treated with rPoIFN-\u03b3-W, rPoIFN-\u03b3-M, or commercial rPoIFN-\u03b3. Taken altogether, Q67R and fusion peptide in the rPoIFN-\u03b3 protein can, respectively, reduce antiviral activity and antiproliferation activity of IFN-\u03b3, with little effect on NO induction. Our data indicate that these three activities reside in independent functional domains of PoIFN-\u03b3.",
