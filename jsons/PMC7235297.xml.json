Older people have been specifically advised to stay home given their vulnerability to COVID-19 and to reduce the burden on health services by limiting the spread of the illness. The adverse effects of isolation may be especially felt by older people (Armitage and Nellums, 2020) and people with preexisting mental illness (Druss, 2020). Living alone, loneliness, and social isolation are well-recognised risk factors for suicide in late life (Draper, 2014). Before the pandemic, even older adults living in senior housing communities designed to reduce social isolation described moderate levels of loneliness (Morlett Paredes et al., 2020), presumably now exacerbated by quarantine and social isolation.",

            "text": "According to the interpersonal theory of suicide, suicide may be the result of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, combined with an acquired capability for suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010). In a pandemic environment of social lockdown, older people may be especially vulnerable to suicide through a heightened sense of disconnectedness from society, physical distancing, and loss of usual social opportunities, as well as greater risk of anxiety and depression (Santini et al., 2020). This may be compounded by feeling devalued or burdensome to society with the explicit knowledge that older people may not receive the health care they need due to resource rationing (Rosenbaum, 2020). During the pandemic, these perceptions may be heightened in older adults with depression and/or self-harm, who already feel a burden on society and their families (Crocker et al., 2006; Wand et al., 2018), and now hear from the media that they are deemed less worthy of care (Schwartz, 2020; Wenger and Schapiro, 2020). Such portrayals may contribute to suicidal behaviors in older adults by reinforcing negative internalized views on ageing as associated with loss of value and productivity and dependency (Crocker et al., 2006; Wand et al., 2018). Quarantine itself has been associated with psychological distress, especially when mandated (Brooks et al., 2020). During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, suicides were reported following enforced quarantine in a Taipei hospital (Barbisch et al., 2015). Stressors associated with poor mental health outcomes and quarantine include longer durations of quarantine, frustration and boredom, insufficient information, inadequate supplies, and fear of infection, many of which disproportionally affect older people (Brooks et al., 2020).",

The pandemic may result in new cases of affective disorders and create barriers to accessing treatment. During the SARS epidemic, high rates of psychological distress were associated with quarantine including symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with greater prevalence of PTSD symptoms associated with longer periods of quarantine (Hawryluck et al., 2004). Psychiatric disorders, PTSD more so than depression, may also be long-term sequelae of an epidemic (Mak et al., 2009). Further, higher rates of probable PTSD and greater intensity of symptoms were found in residents of high SARS-prevalent areas compared to low SARS-prevalent areas, and in older people (aged 60+), even in those not infected (Lee et al., 2006). The COVID-19 pandemic compounds this and other preexisting trauma in older adults, further contributing to risk of suicide and mental illness, and in addition to the \u201cparallel epidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression, and fear in the general community (Yao et al., 2020).",

People with severe mental illness already experience discrimination and stigma, may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, have greater barriers to receiving timely medical care, and treatment may be less effective (Yao et al., 2020). Those residing in nursing homes may be especially at risk of neglect with inadequate resources, overwhelmed staff (Thomas, 2020), and less community service in reach during lockdown. Regular appointments for mental health follow-up and prescriptions may be cancelled as determined to be \u201cnon-essential\u201d or attendance hampered by disruptions to public transport, advice to stay home, and the media focus on emergency medical care, all undermining efforts to manage psychiatric illness in the community (Reger et al., 2020). People presenting to Emergency Departments with suicidal behaviors may also be disadvantaged through overcrowding, long wait times (Reger et al., 2020), and the prioritization of suspected COVID-19 cases and infection control measures, resulting in suboptimal care and follow-up and potentially influencing suicide rates.",

Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of over 10 million one-fifth of whom are aged 60+, was seriously hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of preparation for this sudden outbreak and mass quarantine measures adopted in all communities and villages of this city especially affected older adults. Initially, there were inadequate social support services for older people living alone. During the peak of the outbreak, some older adults could not receive timely and necessary medical services for their chronic diseases because routine services were cancelled in overwhelmed general hospitals, public transport was suspended, and concerns about acquiring the infection in hospitals. These barriers to treatment would be expected to increase distress and relapse of mental illness in older people (Yang et al., 2020), increasing suicide risk. Later, community workers and volunteers were mobilized to provide social support services, groceries, and purchase medication for older residents. Due to the high case-fatality rate among infected older patients (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology, 2020), older adults may have heightened fears of contracting infection and dying. Further, most older adults obtain information from television and radio, which relayed limited information about COVID-19 prevention and mental health care, resulting in anxiety and misinformation about the pandemic. Loneliness increased too, as Chinese older adults prefer face-to-face social interactions, interrupted by social distancing requirements.",

An online survey of 227 Wuhan-based older adults from 27 January to 2 February 2020 (B-LZ, unpublished data) revealed 39.2% had a low mood and 4.4% endorsed suicidal ideation in the last two weeks, clearly indicating need for urgent psychosocial and crisis intervention. Although there is no pre-pandemic comparison data for Wuhan, a recent meta-analysis revealed a 12-month prevalence of 9.7% for suicidal ideation in Chinese older adults (Wang et al., 2020). The apparent lower prevalence in the Wuhan online survey is likely an underestimate given that it only assessed a 2-week period. Early on, China launched strategies for preventing and reducing mental health crises, including suicidal behaviors, in the general population (Li et al., 2020). Guidelines and public health educational material for health professionals and the general public complemented new online mental health services and the positioning of mental health professionals in isolation hospitals (Li et al., 2020).",

The prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress increased substantially during the period of major social unrest in Hong Kong compared with previously (Ni et al., 2020). Many health and community services for older people have been suspended or much scaled down since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak including mental health services, day hospitals, and daycare services. Core outpatient and inpatient mental health services have been maintained, but some older patients are afraid to attend hospitals for fear of contracting COVID-19, contributing to inadequately treated mental illness and associated suicide risk.

The SARS epidemic was associated with increased risk of completed suicide in older women, but not men or the population aged under 65. Factors such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to health care may have been contributory. It was postulated that female elders, because of their preexisting ready engagement in social and health services, were more susceptible to the effects of temporary suspension of these services during the SARS outbreak (Chan et al., 2006).

There has been no way to celebrate funeral rites, nor accommodation in the cemeteries of the place of residence. The inability to accompany relatives in the last moments of life has been especially heartbreaking.

Information is important to mitigate the risk of psychological distress, including providing older people with a clear rationale for why self-isolation is important, general education about the virus to reduce stigmatization, and emphasizing the altruistic decision to stay home (Brooks et al., 2020). Conveying such information via television may be an effective approach that reaches many older people. The APS includes seeking information from reliable sources and in moderation, keeping concerns in perspective, and utilizing existing healthy coping skills. There are suggestions for coping with social distancing such as using videoconferencing, text messaging, phone calls, and e-mail with friends and family instead of face-to-face meetings. A sense of belonging, connectedness, and social support can be derived through online technologies (Armitage and Nellums, 2020), addressing key suicide risk factors. For some older people, this will involve learning new skills; Australians aged 65+, for example, are the most digitally excluded population group, least able to use digital technology for social connectivity and accessing information and services (Thomas et al., 2017).",

Children can be encouraged to keep contact with their older parents to reduce fear and loneliness. For those without relatives, support services could be provided by community workers. Online technologies can also be utilized to promote a sense of belonging and provide social support for older people (Newman and Zainal, 2020). Formal services, such as Tele-Help/Tele-Check in Italy, telephone support, and monitoring, have demonstrated benefits in suicide prevention for older people (De Leo et al., 2002). This model of proactive connection of older adults with health services via phone could be used to provide home assistance to older people at risk of suicide through social isolation, and/or psychological or physical illness. Variations of this approach could be delivered by family and friends, charities, voluntary organizations, or healthcare professionals (Armitage and Nellums, 2020). Telephone crisis line services too have played a role in suicide prevention and crisis support in the community providing an inexpensive, convenient and anonymous means of seeking support (Krysinska and De Leo, 2007) with the potential to reach a large proportion of community-dwelling older people (Chan et al., 2018).",
