Objective: We sought to examine the relation of the nasal microbiota at bronchiolitis-related hospitalization and 3 later points to the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Methods: In 17 US centers researchers collected clinical data and nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Trained parents collected nasal swabs 3 weeks after hospitalization and, when healthy, during the summer and 1 year after hospitalization. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to all nasal swabs. We used joint modeling to examine the relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances to the risk of recurrent wheezing. Results: Among 842 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, there was 88% follow-up at 3 years, and 31% had recurrent wheezing. The median age at enrollment was 3.2 months (interquartile range, 1.7-5.8 months). In joint modeling analyses adjusting for 16 covariates, including viral cause, a 10% increase in relative abundance of Moraxella or Streptococcus species 3 weeks after day 1 of hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.38 and 95% highdensity interval [HDI] of 1.11-1.85 and HR of 1.76 and 95% HDI of 1.13-3.19, respectively). Increased Streptococcus species abundance the summer after hospitalization was also associated with a greater risk of recurrent wheezing (HR, 1.76; 95% HDI,. Conclusions: Enrichment of Moraxella or Streptococcus species after bronchiolitis hospitalization was associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 years, possibly providing new avenues to ameliorate the long-term respiratory outcomes of infants with severe bronchiolitis.

Over the past 60 years, multiple cohort studies have demonstrated that up to 60% of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis will have recurrent wheezing within 3 years of hospitalization. 2 Furthermore, compared with healthy control subjects, children hospitalized with bronchiolitis are also at much greater risk of childhood asthma 2 and even longer-term respiratory morbidity. 24 Many of these bronchiolitis cohorts focused on viral infections (eg, RSV). However, viruses infect infants within a complex microbial ecosystem (ie, microbiome), 25 and research results over the last decade have demonstrated that airway bacteria, including nasal microbiota, are also associated with wheezing outcomes in children. 6, 7, 12, 26 Several studies of airway microbiota have implicated Moraxella, Haemophilus, and/or Streptococcus species as risk bacteria for wheezing and asthma by using both cross-sectional 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] 26 and prospective 6,7,12 study designs. Teo et al 12 found in the Australian Childhood Asthma Study (n 5 234) that asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonization with a high abundance of Streptococcus species around age 2 months was associated with wheeze at age 5 years. 12 In the same cohort greater frequency of detecting nasopharyngeal Moraxella, Haemophilus, or Streptococcus species at times of health between the ages of 6 months and 2 years was associated in sensitized children (n 5 73) with greater odds of chronic wheeze at age 5 years and in nonsensitized children (n 5 64) with any wheeze in the first 3 years of life (ie, transient wheeze). 6 For the first time, we have examined the longitudinal nasal abundances of these 3 risk bacteria (ie, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus species) in a large and diverse multicenter cohort of US infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. The relative abundances of these risk bacteria on hospitalization were not associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. However, in the weeks after severe viral infection, enrichment of an infant's nasal ecosystem with either Moraxella or Streptococcus species increased the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years and . Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each of the 3 risk groups for the outcome of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Curves were stratified by membership in the risk group. The table shows the number of subjects still at risk for recurrent wheeze based on event occurrences and study dropout. Infants can be included in more than 1 risk group.

Similar to the Childhood Asthma Study, 12 we also found a separate group of children who at a median age of 9 months (ie, around 6 months after hospitalization), although healthy, had increased Streptococcus species abundance and a greater risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. However, it remains unclear why these infants have a later increase in Streptococcus species abundance and, as seen in Fig 3, a later onset of recurrent wheezing. The lack of a significant association with Haemophilus species might have been due to inadequate power, a weaker association, or both. Importantly, we confirmed all of these findings using multiple analytic techniques. Moreover, our joint models demonstrated that the present microbiota findings are independent of multiple other potential confounding factors associated with childhood asthma, including viral cause and IgE sensitization in infancy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 544, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 545, "end": 547, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1148, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1151, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1402, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1595, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1760, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1929, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1932, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1933, "end": 1936, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1939, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2117, "end": 2119, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2120, "end": 2123, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2127, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2132, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2137, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2140, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2407, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2788, "end": 2789, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3975, "end": 3977, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4338, "end": 4344, "text": "Fig 3,", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "These findings suggest that interventions that alter the nasal microbiome after hospitalization for bronchiolitis might be beneficial. Indeed, Beigelman et al 23 found in a small (n 5 39) randomized placebo-controlled trial that azithromycin for 14 days in infants hospitalized with RSV-related bronchiolitis reduced nasal lavage Moraxella species abundance at 2 weeks. 22 Furthermore, in concordance with our findings, decreased Moraxella species abundance at 14 days, no matter the group assignment, was associated with reduced odds of recurrent wheezing (ie, > _3 wheezing episodes) over the subsequent 12 months. 22 This potential approach to bronchiolitis treatment needs further study and thoughtful consideration about possible unintended consequences of widespread antibiotic use. Indeed, bronchiolitis and its long-term respiratory outcomes might be best understood as a complex adaptive system. 27 Taken together, the potential health effects of the airway microbiome are tantalizing. However, we note that early Moraxella species colonization in healthy infants was associated with lower rates of respiratory tract infection. 28 Thus understanding the potential protective role of Moraxella species in healthy populations, compared with its consistent identification as a risk bacterium (not only before and during acute respiratory tract infections 6, 11 but also in asthmatic patients 8 ), will be critical to advancing our understanding of the role of this genus (and ultimately the strain of Moraxella species) in respiratory conditions. It is also possible that the posthospitalization increases in Moraxella or Streptococcus species abundance might simply be markers of children who are already predisposed to recurrent wheezing. Alternatively, the association between posthospitalization increases in Moraxella or Streptococcus species abundance and recurrent wheezing might be causal (ie, microbiota might influence host immune response to viral infection). 23, 29, 30 If true, influencing microbiome reassembly after hospitalization for bronchiolitis either with antibiotics 22, 23 or, preferably, with intranasal administration of protective species 31 might be an approach to help prevent asthma in this high-risk group. This study has potential limitations. First, although bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants, we suggest caution when generalizing our results beyond the approximately 130,000 US infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis each year. 32 Second, bronchiolitis is a condition that affects the entire airway from the nose to the lungs. 32 Although our samples from the nose might not represent pathobiology in the lung, nasal and bronchial cells have similar responses to stimulation and significant mediator release correlations. 33 Third, there was no healthy control group in MARC-35, but our study objective was not to examine the association between the microbiome and the development of bronchiolitis within the general population but rather to determine the relation of the nasal microbiota to recurrent wheezing within the high-risk population of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 161, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 370, "end": 372, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 617, "end": 619, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 905, "end": 907, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1139, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1363, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1366, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1980, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1984, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1987, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2098, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2101, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2501, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2600, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2795, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Fourth, although we have 88% follow-up at age 3 years, the number of nasal swabs included in the analyses decreased over time because of parents forgetting to collect swabs and the exclusion of samples collected after the onset of recurrent wheezing, as required by the joint model.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Fifth, the present results are unable to untangle how host environmental conditions, including bacterial-bacterial interactions at the time of infection, might enhance the survival of certain species. 34 However, our group is currently examining the role of airway microbe-host relations in the development of childhood asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 203, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Sixth, these analyses will need to be repeated when the children in the cohort turn 6 years of age and are formally evaluated for asthma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Finally, the present analysis accounted for neither potential genetic differences within our sample 32 nor different strains of Moraxella and Streptococcus species or microbiome function.
