However, it requires repeated hospital visits which may not be ideal in the current pandemic of Covid-19. The mortality rate of Covid-19 increases significantly with age, ranging from 0.32% in the 20-49-year age group to 14.8% in the \u2265 80-year age group [2] . Bladder cancer tends to occur in chronic smokers with a median age of over 70 years [3] , and they are also prone to developing severe sequelae if they happen to contract Covid-19. This raises a question on whether we should continue, postpone, or terminate intravesical therapy for NMIBC patients. Polling questions were posted via the #UroSoMe platform [4] , but they did not yield any dominant preferences from the audience possibly due to varying resource availability and changing pandemic situation.",

The regimens vary across different centers in terms of number of instillations and duration of treatment course. In a meta-analysis by Sylvester et al. [5] , a short intensive schedule within the first 3-4 months versus a longer term (1-year course) but less intensive treatment schedule appears to be equally effective. The results imply that it may be oncologically safe to space out the intravesical chemotherapy instillations, as soon as a longer duration of treatment is planned to be given. However, patients still have to go to the hospital despite a less frequent instillation schedule; the risk of Covid-19 infection must be weighed against the benefit of 38% reduction in 1-year recurrence rate [6] . Patients who do not opt for intravesical chemotherapy can be followed up with surveillance cystoscopy.",

To minimize the number of hospital visits, having at least four out of six doses of induction course, and two out of three doses of maintenance course should be considered acceptable. High-risk NMIBC patients who have on-going intravesical BCG therapy for more than 1 year can be safely terminated. For patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC, given the lower risks of disease recurrence and progression, we should consider whether it is still worthwhile to proceed to BCG therapy during this critical time period of Covid-19 pandemic. We can discuss about the option of postponing BCG therapy, but we should emphasize the lack of oncological data in this approach. In countries where there is shortage of BCG, alternative treatments such as device-assisted intravesical chemotherapy can be considered. Countries with whole population BCG vaccination appeared to have a lower incidence and death rate from Covid-19; whether exposure to intravesical BCG has any protective effect towards Covid-19 remains to be explored [10] .",
