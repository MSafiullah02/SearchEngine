In return, they provide bioactive molecules which can play critical roles on plant defense system. Fifty six endophytes were isolated from the leaves, root, bark and fruits of Sonneratia apetala, a pioneer mangrove plant in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. A total of 56 isolates were obtained and 12 different species within 8 genera were identified using morphological and molecular characteristics. Antimicrobial activity of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanolic (MeOH) extracts of these 12 different species were analyzed by resazurin assay and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The fungal extracts showed antimicrobial activities against more than one tested bacterium or fungus among 5 human pathogenic microbes, i.e. Escherichia coli NCTC 12241, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 12981, Micrococcus lutus NCTC 7508, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7508 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. Overall, methanolic extracts showed greater activity than that of ethyl acetate extracts. Of the isolates identified, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium equiseti were the most active isolates and showed activity against microorganisms under investigation. Methanolic extracts of C. gloeosporioides and A. niger showed the lowest MIC (0.0024 mg/mL) against P. aeruginosa. The study indicates that endophytic fungi isolated from S. apetala species possess potential antimicrobial properties, which could be further investigated.",

Majority of these newly emerged diseases are caused by microorganisms and causative microbes are increasingly becoming drug resistant over time (Bhatia and Narain 2010) . To combat such infectious diseases, novel bioactive compounds from plants and microorganisms could provide the best alternative as source of potential and promising drugs (Morens et al. 2004) . Although, plant is the major source of bioactive compounds, nevertheless, endophytes could play a vital role in search of new bioactive compounds (Jalgaonwala et al. 2011) . Endophytic fungi colonize healthy plant tissues without any disease symptoms and protect plants from herbivores and pathogens as because they produce bioactive secondary metabolites in the host tissues. It is reported that, endophytic fungi could produce similar or the same bioactive metabolites as its host plant. The environmental conditions of plant habitat have also some effects on the endophytes present inside the plants (Sette et al. 2006) .",

These halophytic (salt tolerant) plants thrive in intertidal areas that receive daily inundation between mean sea levels and the highest astronomical tides. It has been well established that environment where the plant grows has enormous effect on the diversity of the metabolites produced by the entophytes (Tomlinson 1986; Duke et al. 1998) . With this end in view, Sonneratia apetala (Buch.-Ham), has been selected for the present study because this plant has hardly been considered for its bioactive endophytic fungi and is one of the most dominant species in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the abundance of endophytic fungi associated with S. apetala found in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh and evaluate antimicrobial activity of the fungal endophytes against human pathogens. Screening of endophytic fungi with inhibitory activities against pathogenic bacteria or fungi might lead to potential novel natural products with higher antimicrobial activity.",

Serial dilutions were performed in such that each well had 50 \u00b5l of the test material in serially descending concentrations. 30 \u00b5l nutrient broth and 10 \u00b5l of resazurin indicator solution were added to each well. Finally, 10 \u00b5l of bacterial suspension (5 \u00d7 10 5 cfu/ml) was added to each well. To prevent the bacterial culture dehydration, each plate was wrapped loosely with cling film. Each plate had a column with a broad-spectrum of antibiotic as positive control (usually ciprofloxacin in serial dilution) a column with all solutions with the exception of the bacterial solution adding 10 \u00b5l of nutrient broth instead. The plates were prepared in triplicates, and placed in an incubator set at 37 \u00b0C for 18-24 h. The color change was then assessed visually. Any color changes from purples to pink or colorless were recorded as positive. The lowest concentration at which color change occurred was taken as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value.

A range of 520 to 602 nucleotide pair sequences were obtained. Neopestalotiopsis chrysea has the shortest length of ITS region of 520 base pair in contrast to Aspergillus niger which was 602 base pair. Table 1 represents the sequence data of isolated endophytes from S. apetala, where 99 to 100% BLAST match sequences were obtained. Table 2 represents the pair-wise genetic distances estimated from sequenced data. The pair-wise genetic distances ranged from 0.376 to 0.927. The maximum pair-wise genetic distance (0.927) was found between SaL11 (A. niger) and SaR7 (F. equiseti). The result can be justifying by reason that they both are from different genus. Although three Alternaria spp. and two Cladosporium species were present but the (1) IR = the total number of isolates yielded in a given trial The total number of samples in that trial maximum similarity was found in between SaL5 (Alternaria arborescens) and SaF5 (Epicoccum nigrum). A UPGMA tree was constructed (Fig. 3 ) from these distance matrix using the software PUAP 4.0. The UPGMA tree of 12 isolated endophytic fungi shows two main clusters. Cluster one consisted with eight fungi viz. SaL11 (A. niger), SaL2 (Alternaria brassicicola), SaR7 (F. equiseti), SaR9 (Cladosporium cladosporioides), SaR1 (Xenoacremonium recifei), SaL13 (Cladosporium perangustum), SaL9 (Colletotrichum glosporides) and SaF1 (Cladosporium tenuissimum). The second cluster was consisted with four fungi and they are SaL5 (A. arborescens), SaF5 (E. nigrum), SaL4 (A. tenuissima) and SaB6 (Neopestalotiopsis chrysea).",

The findings of this study also suggest that endophytes from harsh and competitive environments, such as mangrove ecosystem, might be an attractive source for new anti-infective compounds. Xing et al. has recently reported Mycospharerella spp., Fusarium spp. Glomerella spp., Phomopsis spp., and Pestalotiopsis microspore from S. apetala (Xing et al. 2011) . The present work is the first report of endophytic fungi A. tenuissima, A. brassicicola, A. arborescens, C. cladosporioides, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum, E. nigrum, N. chrysea, X. recifei and A. niger isolated from S. apetala. In the present study, Fusarium sp. inhibited both bacteria and fungi with lowest MIC, which was in agreement with the information reported in a previous study that demonstrated Fusarium sp. isolated from Saussurea involucrata with broad antimicrobial spectrum (Lv et al. 2010) . In another study, endophytic fungi isolates from twelve mangrove species were found to be diverse. Similar to our study, the study reported the extraction of fungal broth by ethyl acetate while the mycelia were extracted using methanol, hexane and ethyl acetate in sequence, respectively (Buatong (Bhardwaj et al. 2015; Minarni et al. 2017 ) followed by methanol. As a solvent, ethyl acetate solvent possesses medium polarity so that it has the ability to dissolve both polar and non-polar active compounds and methanol solvent being a polar solvent can dissolve almost all organic compounds, even polar, semi polar and non-polar (Rahmawati et al. 2018 ). However, apart from separation of compounds, the solvents had no effect on antimicrobial potential of the fungal extracts as the extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure using rotary evaporator.",

Therefore, in addition to this, we chose nucleotide sequence analysis of ITS region because it lies between two highly conserved genes coding for 18S and 28S rRNA. The ITS regions circumscribe two non-coding regions ITS1 and ITS2, which are separated by the highly conserved 5.8S rRNA gene (Crouch et al. 2009 ). The ITS1 and ITS2 regions are more variable than the other adjacent rRNA gene sequences (Ciardo et al. 2006) . Therefore, offer a better Fig. 3 Phylogenetic tree, constructed based on rDNA sequence (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS 4) by using UPGMA. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option) identification of closely related species. By sequence determination and comparison with the sequences of Genbank data base, all the strains identified to the species level (99 to 100% homology to the best-matching reference sequence).",
