            "text": "Arch Med Res E20_435 2 The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a modulator of vascular function and is needed for regulation of blood pressure, natriuresis, and blood volume control. RAS is needed for regulating regional renal blood flow. The RAS has a number of different regulatory components and effector peptides to facilitate the dynamic control of vascular function (Figure 1 ). Angiotensin I (Ang I) is metabolized by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form angiotensin II (Ang II) that is metabolized by ACE2 to produce angiotensin (2-8) (Ang 1-7), a vasodilator. Though the focus has been on ACE and Ang II, recent studies showed that ACE2 is needed to maintain the balance of the RAS. Acquired or genetic deficiency of ACE2 leads to an increase in tissue and circulating levels of Ang II and reduced levels of Ang 1-7. Thus, ACE2 controls vasoconstriction and blood pressure. Alternatively, reducing ACE activity can lead to a reduction in the circulating levels of Ang II that suppresses the necessity of ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) leads to downregulation of the ACE2 receptor, but not ACE, through binding of the spike protein with ACE2. It is noteworthy that bioactive lipids inhibit the activity of ACE (3) and thus, may indirectly suppress the expression of ACE2 leading to reduction in the availability of ACE receptors to SARS-CoV-1 (COVID-19) to bind to enter the target cell. The other possibility is that bioactive lipids can get incorporated into the cell membrane phospholipids and alter the membrane fluidity that, in turn, changes the expression of receptors both their number and affinity to the respective proteins (4-6). Thus, it is proposed that supplementation of bioactive lipids can possibly, suppress ACE2 expression and decrease the affinity of SARS-CoV (COVID- 19) to ACE2.",

The factor that enhanced the microbicidal capacity of alveolar macrophages was found to be present in the lipid fraction of the alveolar lining material, which could be one of the bioactive lipids.

It is noteworthy that NK cells and CTLs induce apoptosis of tumor cells even when perforin, granzyme pathway is inactivated and is dependent on the expression of soluble phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) (14) . This suggests that one additional mechanism by which NK cells and Arch Med Res E20_435 4 CTLs, even if do not secrete perforin and granzyme, induce apoptosis of tumor cells and those that harbor intracellular microbes is by activating sPLA2. It is likely that perforin and granzyme may have the ability to activate sPLA2 that needs to be established. But what is certain is the fact that PLD (phospholipase D) activation is necessary in the CD16-triggered signaling cascade that leads to NK cytotoxic granule exocytosis that, in turn, is associated with AA release (15) (16) (17) . In this context, it is interesting to note that lipids are a constitutive component of cytolytic granules of CTL, NK and \u03b3\u03b4T cells (18) and cytokine activated macrophages release bioactive lipids to induce apoptosis of tumor cells (13, (19) (20) (21) .",

But, under some very specific conditions PGE2 shows anti-inflammatory actions and is highly beneficial (37, 38) . This antiinflammatory action of PGE2 seems to depend on its ability to enhance LXA4 formation (38) . This suggests that once the inflammation reaches a peak in which PGE2 plays a significant role, the metabolism of AA is redirected to form LXA4 instead of PGE2 indicating a crosstalk between PGE2 and LXA4. This switching of AA metabolism from PGE2 to LXA4 (and probably vice versa, if need be) appears to be a crucial event in the resolution of inflammation in which anti-inflammatory cytokines play a role (39) . In this context, it is interesting to note that 15-PGDH-(15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase, a prostaglandin degrading enzyme) deficient mice showed a twofold increase in PGE2 levels in several tissues including bone marrow, colon, and liver, increased fitness of these tissues with enhanced hematopoietic capacity. These 15-PGDH animals not only had rapid liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy but also showed accelerated recovery of neutrophils, platelets, and erythrocytes (40) . These results are supported by other studies which showed that PGE2 regulates haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration and modulates stem cell trafficking, events that ultimately promote hematopoiesis (41) (42) (43) (44) .

Bioactive lipids are useful in view of their ability not only to Arch Med Res E20_435 8 inactivate enveloped viruses but also several other harmful microbes, enhance macrophage phagocytic capacity, augment wound healing and tissue regeneration, promote hematopoiesis and protect normal cells from both endogenous and exogenous cytotoxic agents with relatively few adverse actions. Hence, efforts need to be made to test their efficacy in SARS-CoV-1 (COVID- 19) infection. It is possible to deliver bioactive lipids orally, parenterally and as nasal drops.",

Alveolar macrophages, leukocytes, T and B cells, NK cells and other immunocytes can release AA and other unsaturated fatty acids to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), SARS and MERS, which are all enveloped viruses. It is possible that the ability of immunocytes to release bioactive lipids could be one of the fundamental innate immune response mechanisms needed to protect from various infections. Thus, failure of these immunocytes to secrete adequate amounts of bioactive lipids to inactivate various microbes including Coronary virus (COVID-19) may render a person more susceptible to infection.

Thus, there is close cooperation not only between epithelial cells and macrophages but also between macrophages and other T cells. This close association among various tissue epithelial and other cells, macrophages and tissue resident T cells (that are needed for local immune response) seem to depend on their (mainly tissue resident memory T cells) ability to uptake fatty acids for their survival from the local tissues/cells that is regulated by the type of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) expressed by the T cells. It was reported that tissue resident memory T cells show varying patterns of FABP isoform usage that re determined by tissuederived factors. It appears that tissue resident memory T cells (and possibly other immunocytes including macrophages) modify their FABP expression depending on the tissue in which they are located or relocated. Thus, tissue resident memory T cells when relocated to different organs modify their FABP expression in line with their new location implying that each tissue resident memory T or need a specific pattern of fatty acids both for their survival and action(23). This interesting observation also argues in favor of the suggestion that each tissue and their resident memory T cells (and macrophages and other immunocytes) need a specific type of bioactive lipid to bring about their action tailed to their location and hence, the necessity of different types of bioactive lipids. This argument can be extended to suggest that, possibly, to inactivate a specific type of bacteria, fungi or virus a specific type or types of bioactive lipid(s) is needed depending on the tissue involved and microbe invading the tissues.Macrophages are needed both for defense against infections and to clear debris and enhance tissue repair. Macrophages adopt initially an inflammatory phenotype (M1 type) to clear debris and bacteria and later change their phenotype to M2 type to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) from AA, resolvins from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and protectins and maresins from DHA to dampen inflammation (7,24-35) restore homeostasis.",
