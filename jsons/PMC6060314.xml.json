Data for hematocrit, white blood cell counts, and fibrinogen were collected from the complete blood counts for each horse.

Horses that developed lethargy, anorexia, fever, excessive nasal discharge, lymphadenopathy, or cough during the quarantine period (14 days for mares, 31 days for stallions) had additional nasal swabs collected at the time of the onset of clinical signs and the pertinent physical exam changes recorded.

Reasons for quality control failure may have been associated with inhibition within the sample, inadequate amount, or quality of genomic material, or DNA/RNA degradation. Inhibition within the sample can be caused by organic material that may obscure qPCR analysis, compounds that can inhibit the reactions (eg, cell lies) or bind genomic material (RNA/DNA).21 The seasonal distribution of quality control failure is suggestive that there are environmental factors that may contribute to the inhibition. The months with the highest failure of quality control are the driest, dustiest, and warmest months in the study location, likely leading to considerable contamination of the nasal passages with organic debris and dust. It would be expected that inadequate genomic material as a cause of quality control failure should not have a seasonal distribution. All of our samples were kept refrigerated in a viral culture media before processing to try to reduce DNA/RNA degradation; however, RNA is more sensitive to degradation than DNA. While we had a fairly high percentage of samples fail quality control, none of those horses had clinical signs typically associated with EIV, ERAV, or ERBV infection such as cough, fever, or tachypnea.",

Of the horses that failed quality control, one had clinical signs consistent with strangles (enlarged lymph nodes and nasal discharge). In a clinical setting, it would have been prudent to collect a second sample for testing. Additionally, there was a single horse with consistent clinical signs, found to be negative on multiple nasal swabs, which was later found to be culture positive from a lymph node aspirate. It is currently recognized that nasal swabs are not as sensitive for recovery of S. equi as guttural pouch lavage or pharyngeal wash samples.22, 23 It is recommended that in clinical cases with consistent signs the type of sample collected should be adjusted to maximize the chances of recovery.",

We do not know if there is a difference in air versus overland travel for transmission of respiratory pathogens in horses. There is some evidence to suggest that horses are more stressed in air travel based on heart rate and heart rate variability.25 In humans, air transportation appears important in influenza propagation and it is likely that ground transport systems and transport hubs play a role in influenza propagation.26\n",
