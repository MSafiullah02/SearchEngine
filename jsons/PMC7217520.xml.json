Given the inherent complexity of a microscopic description taking into account all details, simple models are typically used as basic mathematical frameworks aiming at capturing the main characteristics of the epidemic spreading process and in particular at understanding if and how strategies such as quarantine or immunization can help contain it. Such models have been developed with increasing levels of sophistication and detail in the description of both the disease evolution and the behavior of the host population [1,2].",

The simplest homogeneous mixing assumption, which makes many analytical results achievable, considers that individuals are identical and that each has a uniform probability of being in contact with any other individual [1,2]. Even within this crude approximation, it is possible to highlight fundamental aspects of epidemic spreading, such as the epidemic threshold, signaling a nonequilibrium phase transition that separates an epidemic-free phase from a phase in which a finite fraction of the population is affected [1]. However, this approach neglects any nontrivial structure of the contacts, while advances in network science [3] have shown that many networks of interest have in common important features such as a strong heterogeneity in the number of connections, a large number of triads, community structures, and a low average shortest path length between individuals [3,4]. Spreading models have thus been adapted to complex networks, unveiling the important role of these properties [5\u20137]. More recently, a number of studies have also considered spreading processes on time-varying networks [8\u201313], to take into account the fact that contact networks evolve on various timescales and present nontrivial temporal properties such as broad distribution of contact durations [14,15] and burstiness [8,16] (i.e., the timeline of social interactions of a given individual exhibits periods of time with intense activity separated by long quiescent periods with no interactions).",

            "text": "All these modeling approaches consider that the propagation of the disease takes place on a substrate (the contacts between individuals) that does not depend on the disease itself. In this framework, standard containment measures consist in the immunization of individuals, to effectively remove them from the population and thus break propagation paths. Immunization can also (in models) be performed in a targeted way, trying to identify the most important (class of) spreaders and to suppress propagation in the most efficient possible way [17,18]. An important point to consider, however, is that the structure and properties of contacts themselves can in fact be affected by the presence of the disease in the population, as individuals aware of the disease can modify their behavior spontaneously, adopting self-protecting measures, such as vaccination or mask-wearing. A number of studies have considered this issue along several directions (see Ref. [19] for a review). For instance, some works consider an adaptive evolution of the network [20] with probabilistic redirection of links between susceptible and infectious individuals, to mimic the fact that a susceptible individual might be aware of the infectious state of some of his/her neighbors, and therefore try to avoid contact with them. Such models can lead to a rich phenomenology, with first order transitions, oscillations, and hysteresis phenomena. Other works introduce behavioral classes in the population, depending on the awareness to the disease [21], possibly considering that the awareness of the disease propagates on a different (static) network than the disease itself, and that being aware of the disease implies a certain level of immunity to it [22,23]. The epidemic threshold depends then on the topology of the network on which the awareness propagates.",

Different model definitions can lead to contrasting results. For instance, reducing the probability of being infected according to the instantaneous fraction of infected neighbors of an individual leads to a notable increase of the epidemic threshold and a decay of the prevalence [24]. On the other hand, in Ref. [25], the epidemic threshold stays unchanged when the infection probability is reduced according to a local epidemic incidence obtained by memorizing the past contacts with other infectious neighbors, although the prevalence is also significantly reduced in this case. Both these studies consider diseases propagating on static contact networks and local awareness effects. In contrast, Refs. [26,27] investigate the case of a temporal network in which awareness has the very strong and global effect of reducing uniformly the activity of all individuals and their numbers of contacts, either because they are infectious or because of a global knowledge of the overall incidence of the disease. Under those assumptions of a global, nonlocal awareness effect, both the epidemic threshold and the disease prevalence are notably affected.",

We do not assume any knowledge of the overall incidence, which is usually very difficult to know in a real epidemic, especially in real time. We consider standard models of infectious diseases and both empirical and synthetic temporal networks of contacts. We extend the concept of awareness with respect to the state of neighbors from static to temporal networks and perform extensive numerical simulations to uncover the change in the phase diagram (epidemic threshold and fraction of individuals affected by the disease) as the parameters describing the reaction of the individuals are varied.",

The activity of the agents is a (quenched) random variable, extracted from the activity potential distribution F(a), which can take a priori any form. The temporal network is built as follows: at each time step t, we start with N disconnected individuals. Each individual i becomes active with probability ai. Each active agent generates m links (starts m social interactions) that are connected to m other agents selected uniformly at random (among all agents, not only active ones).11Note that with such a definition, an agent may both receive and emit a link to the same other agent. However, we consider here an unweighted and undirected graph, thus in such a case, a single link is considered. Moreover, in the limit of large N, the probability of such an event goes to 0. The resulting set of N individuals and links defines the instantaneous network Gt. At the next time step, all links are deleted and the procedure is iterated.

It is therefore unable to reproduce a number of features observed in empirical data. An extension of the model tackles this issue by introducing a memory effect into the mechanism of link creation [30]. In the resulting activity-driven model with memory (ADM), each individual keeps track of the set of other individuals with whom there has been an interaction in the past. At each time step t we start as in the AD model with N disconnected individuals, and each individual i becomes active with probability ai. For each link created by an active individual i, the link goes with probability p=qi(t)/[qi(t)+1] to one of the qi(t) individuals previously encountered by i, and with probability 1\u2212p toward a never-encountered one. In this way, contacts with already-encountered other individuals have a larger probability to be repeated and are reinforced. As a result, for a power-law distributed activity F(a), the degree distribution of the temporal network aggregated on a time window T becomes narrow, while the distribution of weights (defined as the number of interactions between two individuals) becomes broad [30].",

In the SIS model, each individual belongs to one of the following compartments: healthy and susceptible (S) or diseased and infectious (I). A susceptible individual in contact with an infectious becomes infectious at a given constant rate, while each infectious recovers from infection at another constant rate. In the SIR case, infectious individuals enter the recovered (R) compartment and cannot become infectious anymore. We consider a discrete time modeling approach, in which the contacts between individuals are given by a temporal network encoded in a time-dependent adjacency matrix Aij(t) taking value 1 if individuals i and j are in contact at time t, and 0 otherwise. At each time step, the probability that a susceptible individual i becomes infectious is thus given by pi=1\u2212\u220fj[1\u2212\u03bbAij(t)\u03c3j], where \u03bb is the infection probability, and \u03c3j is the state of node j(\u03c3j=1 if node j is infectious and 0 otherwise). We define \u03bc as the probability that an infectious individual recovers during a time step, and we impose \u03bc\u226a1 to ensure the equivalence between the discrete time approach and a continuous-time Markov chain analysis [34]. The competition between the transmission and recovery mechanisms determines the epidemic threshold. Indeed, if \u03bb is not large enough to compensate the recovery process (\u03bb/\u03bc smaller than a critical value), the epidemic outbreak will not affect a finite portion of the population, dying out rapidly. On the other hand, if \u03bb/\u03bc is large enough, the spread can lead in the SIS model to a nonequilibrium stationary state, which we determine with an average over surviving runs, and in which a finite fraction of the population is in the infectious state. For the SIR model, on the other hand, the epidemic threshold is determined by the fact that the fraction r\u221e=R\u221e/N of individuals in the recovered state at the end of the spread becomes finite for \u03bb/\u03bc larger than the threshold.",

Above threshold, the system in the thermodynamic limit has a finite probability to reach an endemic stationary state, with infinite lifetime and coverage going to 1, while realizations that do not reach the stationary state have a finite lifetime. The threshold is therefore found as the value of \u03bb/\u03bc where the average lifetime of nonendemic realizations diverges.

We need thus to extend the previous concept of neighborhood awareness to take into account the history of the contacts of each individual and his or her previous encounters with infectious individuals. We consider that longer contacts with infectious individuals should have a stronger influence on a susceptible individual's awareness, and that the overall effect on any individual depends on the ratio of the time spent in contact with infectious to the total time spent in contact with other individuals. Indeed, two individuals spending a given amount of time in contact with infectious individuals may react differently depending on whether these contacts represent a large fraction of their total number of contacts or not. We moreover argue that the awareness is influenced only by recent contacts, as having encountered ill individuals in a distant past is less susceptible to lead to a change of behavior. To model this point in a simple way, we consider that each individual has a finite memory of length \u0394T and that only contacts taking place in the time window [t\u2212\u0394T,t[, in which the present time t is excluded, are relevant.",

We notice here that the extrapolations for \u03b1=0 are less accurate and thus with larger associated errors. Nevertheless, with the evidence at hand, we can conclude that, within error bars, the risk perception has no effect on the epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit, in agreement with the result from Eq. (12), that gives a theoretical threshold (\u03b2/\u03bc)c=0.366 for the AD case. It is however noteworthy that the effective epidemic threshold measured in finite systems can be quite strongly affected by the awareness mechanism, even for quite large systems, and in a particularly dramatic way for ADM networks.\n",

In both AD and ADM networks, an increasing awareness temporal window shifts the effective epidemic threshold towards larger values, up to a maximum given by \u0394T=\u221e, when the whole system history is available. For the ADM networks, this effect is less clear because of the changing height of the maximum of the lifespan when increasing \u0394T. For AD networks, this result is apparently at odds with the mean-field analysis in which \u0394T is irrelevant in the stationary state. We should notice, however, that for \u0394T\u2192\u221e, the critical point is unchanged in the thermodynamic limit with respect to the pure SIS dynamics. Given that for \u0394T\u2192\u221e the effects of awareness are the strongest, we expect that a finite \u0394T will not be able to change the threshold in the infinite network limit. We can thus attribute the shifts observed to pure finite-size effects. Note that this effect is also seen in homogeneous AD networks with uniform activity a (data not shown), observation that we can explain as follows: when \u0394T is small, the ratio of contacts with infectious nI(i)\u0394T recorded by an individual i can differ significantly from the overall ratio recorded in the whole network in the same time window, which is equal to nI(i)\u0394T=\u03c1 (for a uniform activity). Mathematically, we have\n(13)\u03bbi=\u03bb0exp(\u2212\u03b1nI(i)\u0394T)\u2265\u03bb0exp(\u2212\u03b1\u03c1),by concavity of the exponential function. Thus, even if locally and temporarily some individuals perceive an overestimated prevalence of the epidemics and reduce their probability of being infected accordingly, on average the reduction in the transmission rate would be larger if the ensemble average were used instead of the temporal one, and thus the epidemics is better contained in the former case. As \u0394T increases, the temporal average nI(i)\u0394T becomes closer to the ensemble one \u03c1 and the effect of awareness increases. When \u0394T is large enough compared to the time scale of variation of the network 1/a, the local time recording becomes equivalent to an ensemble average, and we recover the mean-field situation.\n",

For large values of \u03c10=I0/N, the awareness (\u03b1>0) can significantly decrease the final epidemic size, as already observed in Fig. 5.

In this work, we have considered the effects of taking protective measures to avoid infection in the context of social temporal networks, a more faithful representation of the patterns of social contacts than often considered static structures. In this context, we have implemented a model including awareness to the propagating disease in a temporal network, extending previous approaches defined for static frameworks. In our model, susceptible individuals have a local perception of the overall disease prevalence measured as the ratio of the number of previous contacts with infectious individuals on a training window of width \u0394T. An increased level of awareness induces a reduction in the probability that a susceptible individual contracts the disease via a contact with an infectious individual.",

In the case of the ADM model (temporal network with memory effects) on the other hand, awareness seems to be able to shift the threshold to an increased value, but very strong finite-size effects are present: our results are compatible with an absence of change of the epidemic threshold in the infinite-size limit, while, as for the AD case, the epidemic prevalence is decreased.",

These empirical networks differ from the network models from two crucial points of view. On the one hand, they have a relatively small size. Given that important finite-size effects are observed in the models, especially in the one with memory effects, one might also expect stronger effective shifts in such populations of limited size. On the other hand, AD and ADM networks lack numerous realistic features observed in real social systems. On AD and ADM networks, contacts are established with random nodes (even in the ADM case) so that the perception of the density of infectious by any node is quite homogeneous, at least in the hypothesis of a sufficiently large number of contacts recorded (i.e., at large enough times, for a\u0394T\u226b1). This is not the case for the empirical networks, which exhibits complex patterns such as community structures, as well as broad distributions of contact and inter-contact durations, specific time-scales (e.g., lunch breaks), correlated activity patterns, etc. [42]. This rich topological and temporal structure can lead to strong heterogeneities in the local perception of the disease. In this respect, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of awareness in more realistic temporal network models.",

Moreover, some features of empirical contact networks, such as the broad distribution of contact durations, seem to enhance this effect even for short-term memory awareness. Overall, our results indicate that it would be important to take into account awareness effects as much as possible in data-driven simulations of epidemic spread, to study the relative role of the complex properties of contact networks on these effects, and we hope this will stimulate more research into this crucial topic.",
