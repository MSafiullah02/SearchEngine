This finding may help to explain the role of IL-13 in virus-induced exacerbation of asthma. Interestingly, our data suggest a different way of regulation in contrast to GATA3 (25) . In virus infection, IL-13 released together with antiviral interferons may reduce the extent of inflammation and tissue injury, because IL-13 inhibits monocyte and macrophage production of proinflammatory factors (26) . The data are scarce on the disconnection between GATA3 and IL-13 in viral infection, but specific viral infections may either decrease or increase GATA3-mediated expression of Th2 cytokines (7, 27) . Moreover, IFN-b may induce the expression of IL-13 recep-tor, leading to a consequential suppression of responsiveness to IL-13 (28) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our network analyses revealed that virus infection is also associated with many alterations in gene-to-gene interactions similar to allergy. In light of the recent demonstration of breaking allergen-specific T-cell tolerance in human tonsils by triggering of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 or TLR8 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b or IL-6 (29), we speculate that viral infections may have an important role in breaking peripheral tolerance and thereby promoting the development or exacerbation of allergic diseases. Rhinovirus is particularly interesting in this regard because it is the most important trigger of wheeze and asthma, especially in atopic individuals (5, 9, 30, 31) . We demonstrate as a new finding that the intratonsillar virus, especially rhinovirus and parainfluenzavirus, detection was independently and positively associated with Th1 type expression. IFN-c, which is mainly controlled by Tbet, has an important antiviral activity and capacity to downregulate Th2 type response (16, 25, 32, 33) . The existence of virus infection and allergy increased the complexity of the gene networks, and interestingly, both disease conditions had similar polarizing influence on the overall gene-to-gene correlation profiles. A negative correlation between antiviral and regulatory genes, particularly IL-17, was observed only in the presence of a virus. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine, and its downregulation most likely limits virus-induced inflammation (25) .
