At least one-third of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis will have a bacterial infection compared with less than 10% of otherwise healthy hospitalized patients [1\u20133]. Bacterial infections continue to be the leading cause of both acute decompensation in chronic liver disease and mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, accounting for 30\u201350% of deaths [2, 4, 5]. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI) and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) are the most significant sources of infection in cirrhosis. While recognition and treatment of SBP has decreased mortality from 80% to 20% in the past 30 years, mortality from infections, particularly pneumonia and septicemia, remain quite high [1]. Bacterial infections can precipitate renal failure and worsening hepatic encephalopathy, and patients with sepsis and liver disease have higher rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and coagulopathy compared to patients with sepsis and no underlying liver disease [6, 7].",

In healthy persons, low-grade bacterial translocation occurs regularly, as bacteria travel to the liver though mesenteric lymph nodes and the portal venous system. The reticuloendothelial system of the liver, compromised of Kupffer cells, exert a filtering effect, inhibiting bacteria from reaching the systemic circulation [1, 6\u20139]. Animal models suggest that both damage to Kupffer cells as well as septal and sinusoidal fibrosis increase risk of bloodstream infections (BSI) and SBP [8]. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth and decreased intestinal motility in cirrhosis also contribute to bacterial translocation from the gut [7]. Proton-pump inhibitors, commonly prescribed for gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis, alter the microbiome and appear to facilitate bacterial translocation as well [1, 9, 10].",

Since cirrhotic patients have a baseline hyperdynamic circulatory state, infection often facilitates cardiovascular collapse and places patients at high risk of septic shock. Nitric oxide, which is a primary driver of systemic vasodilation and circulatory shock, may be overexpressed in cirrhotic patients [6, 7]. Upregulation of various cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-17, also occurs in liver disease and contributes to exaggerated responses to infection [2, 6, 8]. Lastly, since the diseased liver is less efficient at clearing bacterial endotoxins, exaggerated systemic response to bacterial infections may occur more frequently [2, 6, 7].",

However, microbial patterns have shifted to include more gram-positive cocci with broader use of antibiotics and invasive procedures over the past three decades.

Since 1998, E. coli has remained the most common organism associated with SBP, but now accounts for only one-third of cases [10]. Gram-positive cocci now comprise 25% of pathogens isolated in SBP, with Streptococcus and Enterococcus being the most prevalent. Twenty-five to thirty percent of these GPC-associated SBP cases occur in patients taking fluoroquinolone prophylaxis [5, 16]. Multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacilli, including extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonie and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated in cases of health-care acquired SBP [16]. Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aereus (MRSA) have also been isolated in healthcare associated SBP [5]. Anaerobes remain a rare source.

The absence of a postive fluid culture in CNNA may reflect low pathogen burden [10, 12] and use of PCR demonstrates that bacterial DNA are present at detectable levels in most cases [17]. Blood culture bottles should be inooculated at the bedside with at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid to increase culture yield [7, 10]. When ascites fluid culture is positive, a single pathogen is isolated in 90% of cases [10]. Urinary reagent strips that assess leukocyte esterase activity should not be used to diagnose SBP due to an unacceptable low positive predicitve value and high false negative rate [7, 10].Assays of lactoferrin in ascitic fluid may be a more accurate predictor of infection [3, 7].",

Intravenous antibiotics, including a third-generation cephalosporin or amoxicillin-clavulante are recommended; IV amoxacillin-clavulanate is not available in the United States. Cefotaxime has been the most well studied, and has excellent penetration into ascitic fluid [10]. Ceftriaxone is also effective in treating SBP, though its high protein-binding activity makes it theoretically less effective in cirrhosis, where protein synthesis is impaired [10]. Oral ofloxacin and IV ciprofloxacin may also be used in uncomplicated SBP, but should be avoided in patients on fluoroquinalone prophylaxis or in geographic areas with high levels of fluoroquinalone resistance to Enterobacteriaceae [7, 19]. Levofloxacin may be efficacious in patients on fluorquinalone prophyalxis who cannot tolerate \u03b2-lactams [10]. Treatment should be continued for 5 days, as 5 day courses of antibiotics are as efficacious but less costly than 10 day courses [6, 10, 20]. Nosocomial infections, defined as infections occuring after 48 h of hospitalization, are be resistant to \u03b2-lactam in 33\u201378% of cases [5]. Meropenam or tigecycline can be used in nosocomial cases of SBP in areas with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing pathogens [3, 5, 7]. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored if culture is positive and sensitivies are available. Follow-up paracentesis 48 h after initiaition of treament is recommended in patients who do not rapidly improve [10]. A reduction in PMN count by >25% suggests appropriate antibiotic coverage; if such a reduction is not observed, antibiotics should be broadened or the possibility of secondary bacterial peritonitis should be considered [3, 7, 10].",

In a single-center study of 162 cirrhotic patients with a bloodstream infection, 60% of pathogens were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.

Because a TIPS cannot be removed outside of liver transplantation, diagnosis and treatment of endotipsitis is more complicated than that of infections associated with removable indwelling devices. Endotipsitis should be suspected in patients with a TIPS and bacteremia when the source of bacteremia is unknown despite evaluation for other causes. If endotipsitis is suspected, patency of the TIPS should be evaluated using Doppler ultrasound\u2014a thrombus or vegetation is strongly suggestive of endoptipsitis [22]. Treatment relies solely on the use of antibiotics, as source control with TIPS removal is not possible. There are no clear guidelines for the duration of treatment, though in case series, patients who successful cleared their bacteremia were treated for a mean duration of 6 weeks [22]. If bacteremia is prolonged or recurs after a prolonged period of therapy, chronic suppressive therapy until transplantation should be considered. Though active infection is often a contraindication for liver transplantation, there are reports of successful clearance of endotipsitis after the device is removed during transplant [22].",

The epidemiology of community-acquired lower respiratory infections is the same in patients with and without liver disease with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common cause. Other common causes include oropharyngeal bacteria, including Haemophilus influenza and anaerobes as well as less common bacteria, including Klebsiella, Legionella and Mycoplasma [1, 2]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one unique bacteria that is more commonly identified in patients with liver disease than those without [23]. The severity of pneumonia in patients with chronic liver disease is enhanced with a higher rate of ICU admission, more severe clinical presentations, increased prevalence of bacteremia and increased mortality [1, 9, 23]. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for adults with chronic liver disease; while the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal (PPSV-23) vaccine is primarily recommended for this patient population, those individuals who are being evaluated for transplantation should also receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) [24]. Ideally, the PCV13 should be given first followed by the PPSV-23 6 months or more after the PCV13 vaccine.",

A prospective study in India identified gram-negative bacilli as the most common isolate in cirrhosis, with male sex, alcohol use, and bare-foot walking being major risk factors [25]. Vibrio vulnificans, a rare, curved gram-negative bacillus found in warm seawater, can invade open wounds and cause severe hemorrhagic bullae and rapid necrotizing fasciitis. Vibrio vulnificans is also associated with bacteremia and septic shock after consumption of oysters grown in infected waters. In a study of over 1000 cases in Japan, 23% of patients with Vibrio vulnificans had underlying cirrhosis [26]. Cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis is a particularly strong risk factor for Vibrio infection [7].",

Between 2 and 10% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have a detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) [36]. However, high sensitivity testing for HBV DNA can detect occult hepatitis B infection in up to one-third of HCV patients with undetectable HBsAg [37], suggesting the incidence of co-infection is under-recognized [36]. It is thought that HCV exerts a suppressive effect on HBV, because HBV DNA levels are relatively low in HBV/HCV coinfection compared to HBV monoinfection [36, 38]. The most common scenario in which HCV/HBV coinfection occurs is a HCV superinfection on chronic HBV infection [36]. Fulminant hepatic failure due to HCV alone is rare; however studies from areas of where hepatitis B is endemic suggest that chronic underlying HBV at the time of acute HCV infection results in a sevenfold increases in the risk of fulminant hepatic failure [36, 39]. HBV acquisition in pre-existing hepatitis C is less common, but has been reported to result in the development of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy [36]. Coinfection of HBV/HCV results in substantially higher rates of progression to both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma compared with monoinfection with either virus [36, 38, 40].",

Therefore, infection with HDV occurs only in individuals with HBV infection. Two infection patterns are observed:\nCo-infection occurs in acute HBV infection when HDV infects the same individual at the same time. The course mimics acute HBV infection, though HDV co-infection is a risk factor for progression to fulminant hepatitis [41]. Because the majority of acute hepatitis B episodes are self-limited and result in disappearance of HBsAg and appearance of anti-HBsAg antibodies, HDV disappears once seroconversion occurs.\nSuperinfection occurs when HDV infects a chronic HBsAg-positive carrier, resulting in a particularly virulent acute hepatitis or decompensation [41]. Half of all cases of acute liver failure in HBsAg-positive individuals occurs in the presence of HDV [41]. HDV persists in 90% of cases of superinfection and leads to cirrhosis within 5\u201310 years in 70% of cases [41].\n",

HIV coinfection with HCV halves the likelihood of clearing HCV viremia, and accelerates the progression to cirrhosis [43, 44]. Decompensated cirrhosis is 2\u20136 times more common in HCV cirrhosis when HIV infection is present [43, 44]. Treatment of HIV with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the impact of HIV infection on HCV disease progression [45]. Treatment of HCV with interferon/ribavirin is more effective at higher CD4 counts, and thus ART for HIV should be initiated prior to treatment of HCV with interferon/ribavirin if CD4 count is <500/\u03bcL [45]. New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for the treatment of HCV are expected to eliminate the need to elevate CD4 count prior to HCV treatment, but careful consideration of drug interactions between DAAs and ARTs is necessary when treating both infections [46].",

            "text": "Approximately 10% of HBV infected individuals are co-infected with HIV [43]. HIV increases the risk of developing chronic HBV infection, with a more profound effect at lower CD4 counts [43, 47]. HIV also enhances the progression to cirrhosis and increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV infection [47]. Much of the hepatocellular toxicity in hepatitis B is due to immune response against hepatic cells, which would imply that hepatocellular toxicity should be diminished when a virus causing immunodeficiency is present. Indeed, HIV/HBV coinfection results in lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels compared to HBV monoinfection [47]. However, ALT levels do not correlate with clinical severity and liver biopsy is recommended to determine extent of disease [43, 47]. One mechanism of HIV-induced HBV exacerbation is that particularly virulent HBV strains are more prevalent in HIV-coinfected cases. A strain of HBV with a direct cytopathic effect, resulting from a deletion in the core/pre-core region of the HBV genome, has been shown to be more prevalent in HBV/HIV coinfection compared to HBV monoinfection [47]. HIV also induces microbial translocation, which may lead to increased immune activation and thus increased HBV-induced hepatocellular injury [47]. In general, when selecting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for HIV treatment, agents that also have activity against HBV should be used\u2014tenofovir plus emtricitabine or tenofovir plus lamivudine are common regimens [43, 47]. Treatment of HIV without appropriately treating HBV can rarely cause worsening of hepatitis due to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [43, 47]. Further, interruption of HBV-active anti-retrovirals may cause an acute hepatitis B reactivation and rapid progression of liver disease.",
