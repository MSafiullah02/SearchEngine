            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease, especially in young cats. Clinical signs are variable, depending on which organs are affected,1, 2 and it is often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis of FIP, even though there are many tests for evaluating blood and body cavity effusions.3, 4 In Germany and many other countries, a simple assay termed the Rivalta test has been performed on effusions of cats suspected of having FIP. The test was developed by the Italian physician Fabio Rivalta, who published a report of the method in 1895, to differentiate exudates from transudates in human body cavity effusions.5, 6, 7 Since then, the Rivalta test has been used mostly in Germany, Poland, Russia, and France.8 The principle of the test is the formation of a precipitate when a sample of the effusion fluid is added to a solution of acetic acid. The test is inexpensive and can be performed quickly in a private practice setting. The test is no longer used in human medicine, because other analytical methods, including Light's criteria (pleural lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] activity, pleural fluid:serum LDH ratio, and pleural fluid:serum protein ratio), have replaced it. For cats, the test was demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of FIP in 2 previous studies3, 9; however, relatively low numbers of cats were evaluated.3, 9 In dogs, the Rivalta test has not been demonstrated to have diagnostic value.10\n",

Age of the cats, variables measured in blood and effusion fluid, and the definitive diagnosis, when available, were retrieved from the medical records. Inclusion criteria were the presence of effusion as detected by ultrasonographic examination and performance of the Rivalta test. The only exclusion criterion was a questionable Rivalta test result, defined as formation of slightly cloudy swirls in solution with neither distinct dissolution nor distinct precipitation. For determination of the prevalence of FIP and the diagnostic accuracy of the Rivalta test, only cats with a definitive diagnosis were included (Figures 1, 2, 3). For correlation of Rivalta test results with variables in blood or effusion fluid, all cats with a conclusively positive or negative Rivalta test result were included (Figure 4).",

It is possible that when FIP is the primary differential diagnosis, cats are not referred to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital by other veterinarians, but are more often euthanized because of the poor prognosis. Prevalence in this study may also be lower because cats for which there was not a definitive diagnosis were excluded from analysis. For many of the excluded cats, the diagnosis of FIP was considered likely, but owners chose not to pursue definitive diagnostic testing. In addition, owners increasingly decline necropsy examinations, which is another reason definitive diagnoses are lacking. These considerations could have resulted in bias in the population in this study, and the exclusion of approximately one\u2010third of all cats with effusions may have affected the calculated sensitivity and specificity of the test and the predictive values.11, 12 On the other hand, excluded cats could have had diseases other than FIP, and if definitive diagnoses had been obtained, predictive values would have been affected. Another reason for the lower prevalence of FIP in the present study is that some feline diseases, such as various neoplasms, pancreatitis, or heart disease, are diagnosed more frequently today than in the past owing to improved imaging and cytologic techniques; increased diagnosis of diseases other than FIP in the present study would have decreased the prevalence of FIP. The higher prevalence of FIP in cats \u2264 2 years of age was expected because the disease affects young cats,1, 3, 27, 28, 29 and other causes of effusions are rare in such young animals.30\n",

            "text": "The PPV of the Rivalta test for FIP was lower than the PPV of 84 or 85% reported in earlier studies3, 9; in those studies, cats in which the Rivalta test was positive rarely had diseases other than FIP.3 In the present study, which included a larger number of cats, a higher proportion of effusions with positive Rivalta test results were caused by other diseases. It is possible that some of these effusions were present in body cavities for long time periods, resulting in inflammation and serositis secondary to the effusion; subsequent production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines and their presence in the effusion could have resulted in a positive Rivalta test result, which may have been negative during the early stages of the primary disease. Alternatively, cats with a positive Rivalta test and a definitive diagnosis of a disease other than FIP could potentially have had FIP in addition to the other disease, as further diagnostic testing was not performed once a disease associated with development of effusion was diagnosed. However, this is unlikely, because many of the cats with other diseases lived longer than 14 days, the median survival time of cats with FIP has been reported to be 8 days, although some cats live longer.31 Predictive values depend on disease prevalence, which may vary considerably from one clinical situation to another.11, 12 Thus, the lower prevalence of FIP in this study explains the lower PPV of the Rivalta test, but predictive values reported in this study must be interpreted in light of the population evaluated and may not be assigned to other clinical situations. In cats \u2264 2 years, the PPV of a positive Rivalta test for FIP reaches approximately 90% owing to the higher prevalence of FIP in this population.1, 3, 27, 28, 29 Although the sensitivity of the Rivalta test in the diagnosis FIP was also lower than previously reported (98 and 100%),9, 32 it was still high. In addition, the NPV was also high, indicating that if the Rivalta test is negative, the likelihood of FIP as a cause for the effusion is low.",

It was long assumed that a positive Rivalta test would depend on the TP concentration in the effusion6, 33, 34, 35; however, in the present study, neither TP nor globlulin concentrations of Rivalta\u2010positive and Rivalta\u2010negative effusions were significantly different, and high and low TP concentrations were found in both Rivalta\u2010negative and Rivalta\u2010positive effusions. Thus, TP and globulin concentrations appear not to be the major factors correlated with the Rivalta test result, and other components might result in the formation of a precipitate. In a study of human body cavity effusions, several acute phase proteins in Rivalta\u2010positive precipitates could be identified.36 Therefore, it is possible that some protein fractions, eg, acute phase proteins, cause the positive reaction in feline effusions. In this retrospective study, neither electrophoretic analysis nor measurement of acute phase proteins was performed, but these analyses are warranted in a future prospective study. Cholesterol concentration was significantly higher in Rivalta\u2010positive effusions and the OR was highest for this analyte. Cholesterol concentration has been found be useful in differentiating between transudates and exudates in human effusions,37, 38, 39 possibly because of degeneration of cellular components, eg, WBCs and RBCs, in the fluid or because cholesterol can exit the vasculature due to increased capillary permeability in vasculitis.38, 40 In the present study, more Rivalta\u2010positive effusions were classified as exudates, and cholesterol concentrations are increased in exudates; thus, cholesterol concentrations may have been higher in these Rivalta\u2010positive effusions. However, it remains unknown whether cholesterol causes or contributes to the precipitate formed in a positive Rivalta test. Interestingly, triglyceride concentrations were lower in Rivalta\u2010positive effusions than in Rivalta\u2010negative effusions. Triglycerides may not follow the same pattern as cholesterol, as it has been shown in mice fed cholesterol that high cholesterol concentrations actually decreased the production of triglycerides.41 Formation of \u201cpseudochyle\u201d, which typically contains cholesterol but not triglycerides,42 can occur in long\u2010standing effusions. SG depends on concentration of TP and other analytes43 in effusions, but this variable did not differ between Rivalta\u2010positive and Rivalta\u2010negative effusions in the multivariate analysis.",

Hypoalbuminemia may be caused by reduced hepatic production, but most likely was caused by vasculitis. A decrease in albumin also may reflect compensation for increased globulin production.1 Albumin also acts as a negative acute phase protein in cats with FIP and could therefore be downregulated by the immune system. Serum bilirubin concentration, which had the highest OR of all blood variables, was markedly higher in cats with Rivalta\u2010positive effusions, possibly due to the high percentage of cats with FIP in which hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of increased hepatic enzyme activity often occurs.2 It has been suggested that cytokines released in FIP affect bilirubin metabolism resulting in altered excretion into the biliary system1; cytokines can affect degradation of bilirubin by reducing transporter gene expression or directly inhibiting transport protein function in hepatocytes, with consequent hyperbilirubinemia.44 Serum bilirubin concentrations may also increase in FIP from secondary immune\u2010mediated hemolysis or hemolysis caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation, from hepatic involvement, or from cholestasis.1, 45\n",

In addition, during the long investigation period, there was turnover of laboratory personnel performing the test, which may be a source of bias. For cats with diagnoses other than FIP, FIP as a possible concurrent disease was often not investigated. On the other hand, although unlikely, cats with FIP may have had a second disease that might have resulted in effusion. The measurement of blood analytes, including proteins, was performed on serum or plasma, depending on the available specimen. This could have masked some differences between results, as fibrinogen and other proteins involved in coagulation are not present in serum, but remain present in plasma.",
