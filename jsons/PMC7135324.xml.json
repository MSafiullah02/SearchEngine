The law was, hence, meant to control influenza epidemics in entire communities via suppression of transmission in schools. However, in 1979, a 7-year-old child fell ill after receipt of the vaccine. This event along with adverse data reported with respect to the preventive effects of vaccination, made many people suspicious of the vaccine's effectiveness.2 Vaccination became voluntary after a 1994 amendment to the Preventive Vaccination Law.",

The Law was, therefore, amended again in November, 2001. Under the new Preventive Vaccination Law, primary target groups are defined as those aged older than 65 years and those with certain chronic medical conditions who are aged 60\u201365 years. The degree of subsidy for the cost of vaccination is worked out independently by each local government.",

Because the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare predicts demand to be 12.4\u201314 million in 2003\u201304, little effort is being made to raise the vaccination rate in target populations. However, we believe this increase in the production of vaccines and rate of coverage of target populations is insufficient, bearing in mind the rapid growth rate of the elderly population. Moreover, individuals who live with or care for people at high risk, and children, should be vaccinated\u2014the total number of patients with influenza rose from 306 000 in 2000\u201301 to 675 000 in 2001\u201302; 58% of all patients were children aged 0\u20139 years.",

Since Japan lags behind the USA and other countries with respect to vaccination coverage, a national policy to increase uptake should be developed.",
