Type II cells are cuboidal epithelia that serve several functions including the production and secretion of pulmonary surfactant that maintains alveolar surface tension and promotes innate immunity. Type II cells produce cytokines that are critical for regulation of the alveolar barrier and in the regulation of alveolar immune cells. Type II cells also respond to injury and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into Type I cells to repair damaged alveoli.\n\n",

TGF-\u03b2 decreases lung glutathione by inhibiting \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression [9, 10] and further increases oxidant stress by increasing Nox expression [11, 12] and H2O2 production [13].

Consistent with this, supplementing the diets of alcohol-fed rats with the glutathione precursor procysteine reduces oxidant stress and reverses many of the pathophysiological effects of alcohol on the lung [16\u201318]. Antioxidant therapies have not yet been proven to be effective in decreasing mortality in critically ill patients since they have never been directly tested in individuals with alcohol use disorders. However, antioxidants can prevent the severity and duration of acute lung injury [19, 20]. Therefore, bolstering the antioxidant reserves of the lung are likely to be best used as an adjunct to other therapeutic approaches.",

Tight junction permeability is primarily mediated by proteins known as claudins that span the membrane bilayer four times and have both the N- and C-terminal domains oriented inside towards the cytosol. The C terminus of claudins interacts with cytosolic scaffold proteins, most notably zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and ZO-2 [27]. ZO-1 and ZO-2 in turn link claudins to the actin cytoskeleton. While almost all claudins interact with ZO-1 and ZO-2, they differ in the extent of actin association, which correlates with incorporation into functional tight junctions. Other transmembrane proteins also regulate tight junction assembly and stability, particularly occludin and tricellulin [28]. Roles for these proteins in the alveolar epithelium are continuing to be elucidated. However, occludin and ZO-1 expression are both down-regulated by the alveolar epithelium in response to alcohol, consistent with the concept that an early and primary defect in the alcoholic lung is impaired alveolar epithelial barrier function [29, 30].",

Of these, 97 % of claudin mRNA in both type I and type II cells encodes for claudin-3, claudin-4, and claudin-18 [31]. However, type II cells express significantly more claudin-3 than is expressed by type I cells. This difference has functional ramifications, since claudin-3 expression increases alveolar tight junction permeability whereas claudin-4 makes tight junctions less permeable (Fig. 8.3) [32]. One consequence of this difference is that type II\u2013type I cell interfaces are enriched for claudin-3 and are therefore likely to be more permeable than type I\u2013type I cell interfaces. Functionally, the unique permeability of type II\u2013type I cell junctions might provide a paracellular pathway for ion and fluid diffusion that counterbalances ion flux due to channel activity (see below).\n\n",

Perhaps more critically, the decrease in alveolar barrier function due to alcohol is accompanied by a significant shift in tight junction morphology as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8.4). In normal cells, claudins are predominantly localized to cell\u2013cell contact sites. By contrast, cells impaired by alcohol show significant morphological disruption of claudin localization, including strand breaks and increased intracellular labeling. Intriguingly, this correlates with an increase in expression of claudin-5, which is normally expressed at low levels in the alveolus [36, 37]. These effects of alcohol on claudin-5 and epithelial barrier function are consistent with the observations that increased claudin-5 correlates with impaired lung epithelial barrier function in cells treated with methanandamide or in cells directly transfected with claudin-5 [38, 39]. However, whether there is a direct mechanistic link between claudin-5 and disruption of tight junction assembly and function in alveolar epithelium remains to be determined.\n\n",

Transport out of cells on the basolateral surface is by Na,K-ATPases that actively pump sodium out of the cell and thereby provide the gradient that promotes transcellular passage of sodium from the alveolar space into the interstitium.

Na,K-ATPase is composed of several subunits, all of which were up-regulated in the alcoholic lung.

Critically, ENaC activity was also increased by direct oxidation mediated through NADPH oxidase activity. This is in line with other studies demonstrating that reactive oxygen species have the capacity to increase ENaC and lung fluid clearance [43, 44]. Together, increased ENaC and Na,K-ATPase in the alcoholic lung provide a pathway for up-regulated fluid clearance that can compensate for deficits in barrier function induced by dietary alcohol. Studies to date have focused on sodium transport; chloride transport must also increase in order to retain electronic neutrality across the alveolar epithelium. Whether this occurs via up-regulation of chloride channels or by chloride transport via the paracellular route remains an open question [40]. Taken together, these observations explained an initial paradox when the phenotype of the alcoholic lung was first being examined experimentally. Specifically, if chronic alcohol ingestion causes such significant defects in alveolar epithelial permeability, why don\u2019t alcoholics have pulmonary edema at baseline? The marked up-regulation of active fluid transport mechanisms in the alcoholic lung appear to compensate for the increased paracellular permeability and maintain a relatively \u201cdry\u201d airspace. However, this new equilibrium is far more susceptible to the stresses imposed by acute inflammation such as pneumonia or sepsis, and the alcoholic lung is far more prone to alveolar flooding with proteins and fluids during critical illness.",

However, if alveolar barrier function is further impaired due to a second hit, e.g., sepsis or barotrauma, the lung requires an additional increase in sodium transporters in order to prevent alveolar edema. ENaC in the alcoholic lung does have some additional capacity for further up-regulation (e.g., in acute response to endotoxin [42]). However, it is clear that lungs of injured alcohol-fed animals are more susceptible to endotoxin and sepsis induced lung edema than non-alcohol-fed controls [2, 18]. This suggests that in the alcoholic lung, fluid clearance saturates at a level insufficient to compensate for barrier dysfunction which, in turn, exacerbates the severity of ARDS. Therefore, any treatment modality designed to prevent alcohol-associated ARDS must address alveolar tight junctions, since it is not likely to be possible to increase fluid clearance enough to prevent alveolar flooding.",

Specifically, alcohol significantly inhibits expression of the major lung connexin, Cx43 [52, 53], but has less effect on other connexins [52, 54]. A direct mechanism for the effect of alcohol on gap junctions is by partitioning into membranes and changing the connexin microenvironment [56]. Hormones induced by chronic alcohol ingestion can also have deleterious effects on alveolar gap junctions. Most notably, TGF-\u03b2 inhibits alveolar Cx43 expression [55]. Moreover, glutathione depletion and increased oxidant stress induced by chronic alcohol exposure also decrease gap junctional communication [57, 58]. Although a reduction in gap junctions in response to oxidant stress reduces intercellular signaling, it can be beneficial since it decreases the transfer of toxic agents and thus minimizes tissue damage [59, 60].

This interaction was particularly critical for preventing cell injury due to insufficient mitochondrial function. In part, this could be due to direct transfer of metabolites from healthy BMSCs to damaged type II cells. More provocatively, evidence was provided showing direct mitochondrial transfer from the BMSCs to the type II cells, which also appeared to require functional gap junctions. Gap junction permeability is too limited to enable direct movement of mitochondria through channels themselves. Instead, mitochondrial transfer was due to microvesicles that were taken up by type II cells. It is plausible that this gap junction plaque endocytosis could enable mitochondrial transfer since, during this process, the plasma membrane and a small amount of cytosol are taken up by the neighboring cell [62]. Regardless of the specific mechanism, if a mitochondrial transfer pathway is critical for ameliorating lung injury then it is likely to be adversely affected by alcohol, which impairs both gap junctional communication (see above) and mitochondrial function [63].",

In type II cells, P2Y2 receptors are the primary targets for paracrine ATP signaling that induce calcium transients through a G-protein-coupled mechanism [71].

P2X7 receptors differ from other classes of purinergic receptors in that they are linked to a high conductance pore composed of proteins known as pannexins [76]. Thus, ATP stimulation of P2X7 receptors induces additional ATP release, acting as a feed-forward loop to further amplify purinergic signaling. Consistent with this, cocultures of type I and type II cells are more sensitive to stretch-induced surfactant lipid secretion than type II cells in monoculture [67]. The enhanced lipid secretion by cocultures was due to the sensitivity of type I cells to mechanical stimulation. In response to ~20 % stretch, type I cells released fourfold more ATP than type II cells. This supports the hypothesis that type I cells are mechanosensors and that paracrine stimulation of type II cells by extracellular ATP regulates surfactant secretion.",

Procysteine administered as a redox protective strategy restored the ability of type II cells to produce functional surfactant. Interestingly, N-acetyl cysteine was ineffective, since it can only compensate for cytosolic glutathione, whereas procysteine can also replenish mitochondrial glutathione [17]. Exposure to alcohol in utero also has a negative impact on production of several surfactant lipids, indicating that oxidant stress can occur in the absence of atmospheric oxygen [91]. This is significant, since it suggests that pulmonary complications are a likely complication of fetal alcohol exposure, particularly in preterm infants [92].",

Normal alveolar cells interact with an extracellular matrix containing several proteins, including laminin and type IV collagen [94, 95]. When the alveolus is injured, the matrix is destroyed and replaced with a provisional matrix of fibronectin and type I collagen that stimulates cell migration and wound healing [96\u2013100]. Interestingly, fibronectin also stimulates alveolar epithelial cells to more rapidly form a high resistance barrier as opposed to cells on a matrix with basal composition [101, 102]. This is due to enhanced spreading of the cells on a fibronectin-enriched matrix. Although initially beneficial to the lung, barriers formed by alveolar epithelial cells on fibronectin over the long term have lower resistance than barriers formed by cells on laminin or collagen [102].",

In response to chronic alcohol exposure, fibronectin expression in the lung is significantly increased [105, 106].

Chief among these is increased oxidant stress. To some extent, there is overt damage to the alveolar epithelium as a direct result of oxidant exposure. However, the lung epithelium also adapts through subtle changes in phenotype. Hallmarks of the alcoholic lung are similar to changes that occur during lung injury; however they are more limited in scale. Therefore, as previously mentioned the otherwise healthy alcoholic has no clinically detectable evidence of alveolar dysfunction. However, these phenotypic changes predispose the alveolus for an exaggerated response when subjected to the added injury of a \u201csecond hit\u201d such as ventilator-induced lung injury or sepsis.",

However, when coupled with the added impact of alcohol on host defense, even a small effect on collectin family surfactant proteins is likely to be amplified.

As discussed earlier, increased fluid clearance can compensate for some deficiencies in alveolar tight junctions. However, the capacity for up-regulated fluid clearance is not unlimited. Progress in understanding how alcohol affects the expression and assembly of alveolar tight junctions has identified several potential therapeutic targets to improve alveolar barrier function. Given that alveolar tight junctions are remodeled in response to alcohol, this suggests that a successful therapeutic approach targeting the alveolar epithelium may require normalizing tight junction protein composition. Alternatively, given the profound effects of alcohol that diminish tight junction stability, pharmacologic approaches to stabilize incorporation of claudins into tight junctions may prove to be a useful approach to minimize alveolar flooding due to barotrauma.",
