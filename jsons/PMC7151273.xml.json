Various Governments across the world are now engaging with agencies to develop such systems to record demographics, symptoms of COVID-19 disease, data of contacts at all ports of entry to later link confirmed cases with contacts, and even create lab requests and monitors patient outcomes. Relevant information can then be passed on to health officers in their respective geographic areas. These systems can help accelerate detection, reporting, active surveillance and rapid response for COVID-19 cases, and can be installed as a standalone COVID-19 package or can be integrated into a country's existing disease surveillance systems. This innovation in digital healthcare is the brainchild of Ministry of Health Sri Lanka's pioneering design of DHIS2 tracker for COVID-19 cases (Sri Lanka nCoV Surveillance system).1 On the same lines, Singapore government has launched the app tracetogether on March 20, 2020. TraceTogether detect other users of the app who are in close proximity, and can then be used to identify close contacts based on the proximity and duration of an encounter between the two users (https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).o\nCreation of international and national dashboards that integrate information from the WHO and CDC to track the COVID-19 statistics in real time: These dashboards include information on cases according to each country and region, displayed in maps and charts with live geospatial updates to keep constant track of cases. Display of live data at a glance can help capture events ahead of time which is vital in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.oThe Chinese government has released a new app to help the general public find out if they have been exposed. Users can avail of the app through platforms like WeChat, Alipay and QQ, and by registering their phone numbers, name and ID, find out if they have come in close contact to confirmed or suspected case. On the same lines https://www.coronatracker.in/has been launched in India.o\nUsing drones for surveillance: To ensure that public is following safety guidelines, the Chinese government is now using drones with loudspeaker capabilities that can zero in on defaulters who aren't following recommendations and issue instructions to correct behavioral patterns. The drones are also being used for spraying disinfectants on affected areas like bus and train stations.\n",

With self-quarantine and social distancing assuming importance in limiting community spread, virtual care can allow HCW's to maintain continuity of care to patients remotely. The following steps are being taken globally in this regard.o\nCreation of virtual chatbots and webbots for COVID-19 patients so that HCW's can assess and interact with patients via virtual visits and not risk exposure. Telemedicine teams in West are helping train physicians to rapidly screen COVID-19 cases (using questionnaires) and if needed triage them to designated areas to avoid in-hospital clustering and minimizing exposure.oCurtailing, limiting or deferring elective visits and elective surgeries by delivering follow up care by virtual visits. This helps triage many patients at home and divert several stable patients away from the hospitals who would otherwise incur risk of unnecessary exposure.o\nDevelopment of robotic telemedicine carts (Vici, by InTouch Health), equipped with cameras, interactive screens and basic medical equipment which can be sent into quarantined patient areas to assess patients, thus limiting HCW exposure and risk.o\nTele or electronic intensive care units (e-ICU): These can allow HCW's to remotely monitor upto 60\u2013100 patients in ICUs across multiple hospitals. In the USA, more than 300 hospitals in 34 states are taking advantage of such eICU services using two-way cameras, video monitors, microphones and smart alarms connected by high speed data lines.oWeb technology can also help bring visitors into patient rooms using vICU and iPads, thus further reducing visitors load to hospitals.\n",

Previous barriers to virtual care in USA including location constraints and proper reimbursement to providers limited the availability of these services to patients. The US government has recently approved legislation providing emergency funding to waive off some of the financial and healthcare coverage difficulties in relation to telehealth statutes and telehealth restrictions. This can potentially increase the penetration of virtual care to more patients in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.oFurthermore, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Requirement of the U.S. Department of Health has declared that it will not impose penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA rules for the \u201cgood faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency,\u201d allowing use of tools like FaceTime, Google Hangout, Zoom, Skype etc. to connect with patients.oUnder the revised US legislation, telehealth services shall not be limited to patients with COVID-19, allowing it to be used as an option to also manage non COVID-19 patients remotely.oA new US FDA policy has approved devices including clinical electronic thermometers, ECGs, cardiac monitors, ECG software for over-the-counter use, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure monitors, respiratory rate/breathing frequency monitors, and electronic stethoscopes.2 These non-invasive monitoring devices have the potential to be connected to a wireless network through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection to transmit a patient's measurements directly to HCW's eliminating unnecessary patient contact. Some of these devices also have the potential to apply algorithms to transform a patient's physiological parameters into novel indices or alarms that can expedite emergency diagnosis if and when required.oAs per new Indian guidelines,3 a Registered Medical Practitioner is entitled to provide telemedicine consultation to patients from any part of India while upholding the same professional and ethical norms and standards as applicable to traditional in-person care, within the intrinsic limitations of telemedicine. All practitioners are also encouraged to get familiar with these guidelines by online programs developed and made available by the Board of Governors. Recommended tools for carrying out technology-based patient consultation include mobile or landline phones (connected over LAN, WAN, Internet etc), chat programs like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc. or Mobile App or internet based digital platforms for telemedicine or data transmission systems like Skype/email/fax etc. The guidelines also state that in all cases of emergency, the patient must be advised for an in-person interaction with an RMP at the earliest. If an alternative care is not present, tele-consultation might be provided if it is the only way to provide timely care. Practitioners should exercise their professional judgment to decide whether a telemedicine consultation is appropriate in a given situation or an in-person consultation is needed.\n",
