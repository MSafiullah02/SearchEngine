            "text": "A wide range of respiratory viruses have been identified as causes of significant morbidity and mortality among transplant recipients, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronavirus (Table 1).1 Several features are common among all of these viruses in the transplant population:\nThe seasonality of respiratory viral infections among transplant recipients usually follows that of the general population.2, 3\nThe viruses all cause a range of disease, from mild congestion and rhinorrhea to more severe tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. No one virus is exclusively associated with one clinical syndrome (ie, influenza\u2010like illness, croup, etc). As such, diagnostic strategies should initially be broad, attempting to screen for all recognized viruses3, 4 with particular emphasis on ones that might be amenable to therapy.Transplant recipients often present with mild or atypical symptoms and fever may be absent. Lung transplant recipients, for example, may initially only have subjective symptoms of shortness of breath or subtle changes in pulmonary function testing without more typical symptoms.5\nViral shedding is usually prolonged among transplant recipients. Prolonged shedding is seen even with the use of antivirals and therefore may contribute to the increased risk of resistant variant emergence.1, 6, 7\nTransplant recipients are at higher risk of infectious complications compared to immunocompetent hosts. Respiratory viral infections are a significant risk factor for subsequent development of fungal and bacterial pneumonia.1, 8\nRespiratory viral infections appear to be a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection with the greatest risk in lung transplant recipients,5, 9, 10, 11 although data on this topic in the literature are conflicting.12, 13 The pathogenesis of the link between respiratory viral infections and rejection is not clearly understood.Pediatric solid organ and lung transplant recipients appear to have the greatest risk of both respiratory viral infections and more severe courses and complications14 but a recent retrospective observational cohort of 1096 pediatric solid organ transplant recipients found that all\u2010cause death after respiratory viral infection was rare (4%) and no definitive attributable death occurred.15\nAll are potential nosocomial pathogens which can be spread by staff or visitors with mild upper respiratory illness or who are asymptomatic. Nosocomial transmission of influenza in transplant wards has been associated with significant mortality/morbidity early after transplant.7, 16\n\n",

Commercially available multiplex assays differ in sensitivity and specificity for different viruses most notably adenovirus,17, 21, 22, 23 and the clinician should be aware of the performance characteristics of the assay used.

Influenza vaccination is the key measure to prevent influenza.36 Two types of influenza vaccines exist, the inactivated influenza vaccine and intranasal live\u2010attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). LAIV is contraindicated in SOT recipients and close contacts, due to a potential risk of dissemination of the vaccine strain. One dose of the seasonal intramuscular trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine is the standard of care in adults, and two doses 4 weeks apart are recommended for na\u00efve children <9 years of age.36 Immunogenicity of influenza vaccine is variable in SOT recipients, depending on the type of organ, immunosuppressive regimen used, and composition of the vaccine.37 However, there are increasing data reporting on the beneficial effects of influenza vaccination in SOT recipients. In lung transplant recipients, vaccination with adjuvanted influenza A H1N1/09 vaccine was associated with a reduced incidence of subsequent influenza infection (1.3% vs 25% in unvaccinated patients).38 Influenza vaccination was also associated with a lower risk of graft loss and death in kidney transplant recipients.39 Even if vaccinated patients develop influenza, a reduction in the severity of the disease and in viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab as compared to unvaccinated patients has been observed.7, 40 Previous vaccination has been associated with a lower risk for pneumonia and ICU stay in a large cohort of SOT and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.7 Influenza vaccine is therefore highly recommended for all SOT recipients and household members.36 Influenza vaccine is well tolerated in SOT recipients, and adverse events to vaccination are usually mild and short lived.41 Recent randomized controlled trials found increased immunogenicity in SOT recipients using a high\u2010dose vaccine or a booster strategy using two doses of the standard dose vaccine 5 weeks apart.42, 43 These approaches can be particularly used in case of an expected lower response to the vaccine due to enhanced immunosuppression.

Laninamivir is a long\u2010acting inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor that is approved in Japan for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.47 An intravenous form of zanamivir is available in Europe as investigational drug, but not currently approved. None of these drugs has been specifically tested in prospective trials in SOT recipients for the therapy of influenza. Most studies have shown that early treatment with oseltamivir is associated with decreased mortality, admission to the ICU and complicated outcomes in SOT recipients.7, 33, 34, 35, 48, 49 Less data are available for inhaled zanamivir, but it appears to be equally effective. Experience with IV zanamivir in SOT recipients is limited.50 Intravenous peramivir is approved for use as a single dose, but repeated doses and/or step down with oral oseltamivir may be necessary for SOT recipients.51 Therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors may be associated with reduced incidence of allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients.35, 52 Given the beneficial effect of early administration of antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir therapy should be started empirically in all patients with symptoms compatible with influenza, before microbiological confirmation. Baloxavir is a single\u2010dose FDA\u2010approved therapy for influenza with a novel mechanism of action, the inhibition of cap\u2010dependent endonuclease.

In severe cases, double dosing (ie, 150 mg of oseltamivir twice a day for normal kidney function) is recommended by some experts, with some anecdotal cases of positive outcomes in SOT recipients reported in the literature.55 However, a large randomized controlled trial did not find a benefit of using high\u2010dose oseltamivir for influenza in the general population.56 Importantly, pharmacokinetic studies have not observed a clinically relevant interaction between oseltamivir and immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate).57 The use of the intravenous drugs peramivir or zanamivir can be considered in cases of life\u2010threatening infection or concerns with oral absorption, although, as mentioned, experience with these drugs in SOT recipients is lacking.50, 51\n",

Prospective studies using molecular diagnostics are needed to understand the true epidemiology and clinical spectrum of respiratory viral diseases. In particular, studies of the long\u2010term consequences of infection, even when mild or asymptomatic, are needed. This is particularly important in lung transplant recipients in whom lower tract infection has been associated with an increased risk of chronic rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Prospective studies, using contemporary molecular diagnostic tools including metagenomics, are also needed to define the efficacy and cost of preventative interventions, particularly in high\u2010risk pediatric populations and lung transplant recipients. Novel therapeutic agents are also under development61 and may be useful in the SOT population. Small molecule drugs including oral RSV entry inhibitor Presatovir (GS\u20105806) are under investigation.84, 96, 97 Inhaled DAS181 is a recombinant fusion protein that has shown promise in inhibiting PIV replication.87 In addition, adoptive T\u2010cell therapy including the generation of PIV specific98 and hMPV99 T\u2010cells in healthy donors is an emerging therapeutic modality.
