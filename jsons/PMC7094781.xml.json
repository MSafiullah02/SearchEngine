In all cases, the N-terminal domains I and II are each composed of a chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel. The C-terminal domain III is mainly helical and mediates the homodimerization of coronaviral 3CLpro in the crystal structures, an interaction believed to be important for its proteolytic activity in trans.9 The catalytic residues are thought to be the His41-Cys145 dyad, not a triad as in the structurally similar CLSPs and cysteine peptidases including the picornaviral 3Cpro enzymes. This hypothesis seems to be supported by various coronaviral 3CLpro crystal structures, which showed that His41 does not interact directly with any acidic residues. However, a water molecule has been consistently observed forming a hydrogen bond (2.6 to 2.9 \u00c5) with N\u03b41 of His41. Additionally, this water molecule is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed with two other residues near the catalytic residues, i.e. His164 and Asp187. The role of this water molecule in the proteolytic reactions catalyzed by 3CLpro enzymes has not been thoroughly investigated.",

In the first half of the reaction or the acylation step, a histidine general base (His41 in SARS 3CLpro numbering) assists the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond by the S\u03b3 atom of the cysteine nucleophile (Cys145 in SARS 3CLpro numbering), leading to the formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate (TI1). The ensuing collapse of the TI1 and the departure of the C-terminal product give rise to a covalent thioester enzyme-substrate complex. In the second half of the catalysis, or the deacylation step, a solvent molecule, activated to a nucleophilic OH\u00af ion by His41, attacks the carbonyl carbon of the thioester, forming the second tetrahedral intermediate (TI2), which is followed by the release of the N-terminal product and the regeneration of the catalytic cysteine.",

A few non-covalent, competitive inhibitors10 and peptidic, covalent inhibitors have been visualized in SARS 3CLpro crystal structures.7., 8., 11., 12., 13. The covalent inhibitors studied to date carry either a halomethyl ketone, an epoxide or a 1,4 Michael acceptor function as the reactive \u201cwarheads\u201d. Such functionalities permanently inactivate the viral peptidase via the formation of a non-hydrolysable covalent linkage to Cys145 as the result of the nucleophilic attack by its S\u03b3 atom. As shown by X-ray crystallography, these inhibitors yield a complex analogous to the thioacyl intermediate formed during proteolysis. Although these crystal structures have provided valuable insights into how the residues in the active site of SARS 3CLpro are organized after the inhibition reaction is completed, little is known about the mechanisms of inhibition at the molecular level or by analogy about the details of the acylation step of normal catalysis.

Initially designed as non-covalent peptidic inhibitors against the 3Cpro and 3CLpro enzymes, we recently demonstrated the formation of an acylated enzyme in HAV 3Cpro with concomitant elimination of the phthalhydrazide group.16 Two species of modified enzymes were observed by high resolution X-ray crystallography: (1) a thioacyl-like species similar to those reported in other covalently inhibited 3Cpro and 3CLpro and (2) a species in which the inhibitor is linked to HAV 3Cpro by an episulfide cation ring.16 In the latter complex, the S\u03b3 of the catalytic Cys172 is directly attached to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an oxyanion in the active site. To our knowledge, this is the first structure to show a linkage between the nucleophilic sulfur atom and the sp3 hybridized carbonyl carbon, in a 3Cpro or 3CLpro peptidase. While this structure may be an analogue of the tetrahedral intermediate that occurs during acylation (TI1), the relevance of the episulfide ring complex to normal substrate hydrolysis is limited due to the lack of structures corresponding to other catalytic intermediates.",

Two regions show significant structural divergences: those comprising residues 45-TAEDM-49 and residues 277-NG-278. Residues N277 and G278 are located in a flexible surface loop in the C-terminal helical domain, where residues 276-MNGR-279 form a type II turn. The electron density for N277 was previously noted to be poorly defined and this seems to be attributable to the relatively higher inherent flexibility in this residue.12 Although the loop containing N277 is situated near the dimerization interface of SARS 3CLpro in the crystal, N277 itself is not directly involved in crystal packing. Residues 45-TAEDM-49 form the outer lid of the S2 pocket and their atoms have been associated with temperature factors significantly higher than those of the neighboring residues in various SARS 3CLpro crystal structures. The significance of the flexibility in these residues in the recognition of the P2 residues of peptidyl substrates is discussed below.",

In the latter, the peptidyl portions of the inhibitors form a parallel \u03b2-sheet with a strand (residues 141-ATYVHK-146 in HAV 3C) of the \u03b2-hairpin substructure, and an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with a strand (residues 192-VAGGN-196 in HAV 3C) from the C-terminal \u03b2-barrel. In contrast, in the SARS 3CLpro structures, the substrate/inhibitor peptide is antiparallel to both of the two interacting strands, residues 189-QTA-190 and residues 164-HMELP-168, an arrangement similar to that observed in the subtilisin family of serine proteinases.18 A recent theoretical model also suggested that peptide substrates likely also form an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet in the active site cleft of caliciviral 3C-like proteinases.19\n",

A similar motion seems at play in the active sites of SARS 3CLpro as well; residues 164-HMELP-168 of a structurally equivalent \u03b2-strand to that in \u03b1-lytic protease exhibit shifts of 0.3\u20130.4 \u00c5 from their positions in the unliganded 3CLpro structure (PDB code 2A5A) towards the inhibitor.

With the exception of the side-chain atoms of Asn142, all atoms forming the S1 pocket show below average conformational changes upon inhibitor binding, suggesting that the screening of prospective substrates at the P1 position is largely based on structural complementarity. Indeed, we found that the side-chain atoms of the P1-cycloglutamine (P1-Glnc) residues of both inhibitors 1 and 2 occupy almost identical positions in the S1 pocket. Two hydrogen bonds contribute to the specific recognition and stabilization of the P1-Glnc in the S1 pocket: the side-chain carbonyl oxygen accepts a strong hydrogen bond (2.5 to 2.7 \u00c5) from N\u03b52 of His163 and the amide nitrogen of the pyrrole ring donates a hydrogen bond (\u223c 3 \u00c5) to a carboxylate oxygen of Glu166.

Leucine occurs most frequently at the P2 position in the cognate cleavage sites for coronaviral 3CLpro enzymes. Such preference can be best explained by the induced orderliness in the S2 pocket. The side-chain of Met165, the residue that forms the bottom of the S2 pocket, takes on two alternate conformations (with \u03c71 angles \u223c 0\u00b0 and 80\u00b0, respectively) in both the native enzyme and 3CLpro-inhibitor 2 complex. The presence of the P2-Leu of inhibitor 1 in the S2 pocket completely eliminates the first conformation (\u03c71 angle \u223c 0\u00b0) of Met165. This is consistent with the structural changes in the S2 pocket observed in the structures of the SARS 3CLpro-azapeptide epoxide complexes12: in addition to the restriction in the side-chain placement of Met165, the S2 \u201clid\u201d, a surface loop consisting of residues 45-TAEDM-49, moves up towards the solvent to accommodate the bulkier P2-Phe of the epoxide inhibitor.

Asn189, the residue that forms the mobile lid of the S4 pocket, normally makes a hydrogen bond (2.8\u20132.9 \u00c5) with the P4 carbonyl oxygen via its N\u03b52 atom, which is indeed observed in the inhibitor 1 complexes. The distance between these two atoms is 3.9 \u00c5 in the inhibitor 2 complex because of a shift in the backbone atoms of the P4 and P3 residues of inhibitor 2. This is possibly due to the fact that inhibitor 2 contains a larger hydrophobic residue at the P4 position (Leu) than the P4-Val of inhibitor 1. Leucine does not fit well inside the normally shallow S4 pocket. Consequently, the acetyl modification of P4-Leu, which resembles the peptide bond between the P5 and P4 residues of a substrate, does not lie in the same volume as that of the (acetyl)-P4-Val of inhibitor 1. It is of interest to mention here that the S4 pocket of SARS 3CLpro does occasionally exhibit inducible conformational change to accommodate larger residues such as the N-terminal benzene moiety in the epoxide inhibitor bound to SARS 3CLpro.12 In that structure, only one of the two protomers in the asymmetric unit showed an enlarged S4 pocket, indicating that either the S4 pocket of SARS 3CLpro is less susceptible to induced structural adjustment or the binding energy for a fully buried leucine side-chain in inhibitor 2 is not sufficient to drive the corresponding conformational changes in the S4 pocket.",

            "text": "The SARS 3CLpro-inhibitor 1 complex obtained via the co-crystallization method shows predominantly a thioacyl-like connectivity between S\u03b3 of Cys145 and the Ci atom of the inhibitor (Figure 1\nfor nomenclature, Table 3\nfor bond geometry and Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4\nfor visualization). This structure mirrors those previously published of SARS 3CLpro that has reacted with peptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitors,7 with an epoxide inhibitor12 and with Michael acceptor inhibitors.8 In all of these structures, the C\u03b2\u2013S\u03b3 bond of Cys145 shows a dramatic rotation (\u223c 90\u00b0 in the \u03c71 angle) from its position in the unliganded enzyme. Similar conformational changes in the catalytic residues of the CLSPs are rarely reported in crystal structures. For example, chloromethyl ketone inhibitors usually form two covalent attachments each to one of the His57:Ser195 catalytic pair in their native conformation, possibly through a double displacement mechanism.21 Interestingly, in the crystal structure of elastase complexed with the non-covalent inhibitor, trifluoroacetal-leucyl-alanyl-p-trifluoromethylphenylanilide (TFLA), the C\u03b2\u2013O\u03b3 bond of Ser195 does undergo a similar rotation to avoid steric clashes with the trifluoro function of the inhibitor (PDB code 7EST).22 This rotation in the side-chain of the catalytic serine/cysteine residue not only increases slightly the distance between N\u03b52 of the assisting general base (His57 of elastase/His41 of 3CLpro) and the nucleophilic atom, but also places the nucleophilic O\u03b3/S\u03b3 atom in a position less coplanar with the imidazole ring of the histidine residue. Consequently, the hydrogen bond between the catalytic His:Ser/Cys pair is weakened. When the usual analogy is drawn between these inhibitor-enzyme complexes and intermediate states of peptide hydrolysis, an attractive hypothesis arises stating that the demonstrated innate structural plasticity in the catalytic serine/cysteine residue effectively decreased the backward reaction from the acyl enzyme stage. However, that these conformational changes occur only in inactivated enzymes argues that the non-native conformation is unique to enzyme-inhibitor complexes and may not bear much relevance to the hydrolysis of peptide substrates. Indeed, the crystal structures of serine proteinase complexes showed that the formation of neither the acyl complex nor the tetrahedral intermediate requires the side-chain movement in the catalytic serine to a magnitude similar to that observed in the thioacyl-like complexes with viral 3Cpro or 3CLpro enzymes. In SARS 3CLpro and picornaviral 3Cpro, because of the geometric constraints imposed by the relatively greater rigidity of the oxyanion hole and the catalytic dyad, the additional methylene carbon Ci of inhibitor 1 makes it impossible for S\u03b3 of Cys145 to maintain its native conformation in the thioacyl-like complex. It is noteworthy that two recently reported atomic resolution X-ray crystal structures of \u03b1-lytic protease showed a modified version of the aforementioned mechanism by which proteinases may promote the formation of the acyl enzyme over back-protonation of the catalytic Ser195.20 The authors observed a translational shift in the position of O\u03b3 of the catalytic Ser195 residue that weakens the His57:Ser195 hydrogen bond through a significant decrease in the calculated His57N\u03b52-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\u03b3Ser195 angle from the ideal linear value of 180\u00b0 to 127\u00b0.",

This is clear in the ||F\no|\u2013|F\nc||,\u03b1c difference map when refinement was performed using the coordinates of the thioacyl-like complex. As shown in Figure 4(a), even when the occupancies of both inhibitor and Cys145 were set to 1.0, a significant (> 4\u03c3) positive peak was observed near the position of S\u03b3 of the unliganded enzyme. Correspondingly, there is a small negative density peak near the S\u03b3 atom at its inhibited, \u201cthioacyl\u201d-like position. A similar result was reported by us previously for the complexes of HAV 3Cpro with phthalhydrazide inhibitors.16 In the SARS 3CLpro complex, we have determined that an episulfide cation (thiiranium ring) best explains the electron density near S\u03b3 of Cys145. Subsequent structural refinement has shown that both the negative and positive peaks in the ||F\no|\u2013|F\nc||,\u03b1c difference map disappear when we set the episulfide bonding mode to be the major species (> 70%). The majority of the episulfide species is also confirmed in another crystal structure of the same complex acquired using a lower concentration of inhibitor 1 during soaking, in which the ratio between thiomethyl acyl and episulfide bonding modes remains roughly the same after refinement. This suggests that either linkage can be the \u201cterminal\u201d product of the inhibition reaction in this form of SARS 3CLpro crystals. The distinct difference in the distribution of the two bonding modes between the structures of co-crystals and soaked crystals suggests the intermediacy of the episulfide linkage in solution. Additionally, the collapse of the episulfide cation into the thiomethyl ketone linkage may require conformational changes in the 3CLpro enzyme, which are more attainable in aqueous solution than in crystals (Table 3).",

N\u03b52 of His41 is closer to S\u03b3 of Cys145 than to Ci of inhibitor 1 in the thioacyl-like complex, whereas the reverse is true for the episulfide complex. This is in agreement with the proposed catalytic roles of His41: it acts as a general base to activate S\u03b3 of Cys145 for its nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond, and then as a general acid to protonate the scissile peptide amide nitrogen for the release of the leaving group, the C-terminal product. The imidazole ring of His41 is roughly coplanar with both S\u03b3 of Cys145 and Ci. Moreover, both the N\u03b52\u2013S\u03b3 and the N\u03b52\u2013Ci distances in the two complexes are between 3.0 and 3.6 \u00c5, suggesting that nucleophilic attack and leaving group protonation are closely coordinated.",

Surprisingly, a strong positive electron density peak appeared near the Ci atom of inhibitor 2 (Figure 4(b)). This peak extends into the electron density surrounding the imidazole ring of His41 on the corresponding |2|F\no|\u2013|F\nc||,\u03b1c difference map. The continuous electron density led to our hypothesis that this peak represents a possible position of a water molecule, which, with the assistance of His41, has attacked and opened the episulfide ring formed between S\u03b3 of Cys145 and the methyl ketone function of inhibitor 2. Subsequent refinement of the modified structure in the active site of SARS 3CLpro proved successful; the positive peak disappeared and no negative peaks were observed nearby, indicating that our model provides a reasonable explanation for the additional electron densities near Ci on the initial |F\no|\u2013|F\nc|,\u03b1c map. The final structure shows a distance of \u223c 2.5 \u00c5 between the hydroxyl oxygen on atom Ci and N\u03b52 of His41. This indicates that it is a strong hydrogen bond, considering an overall coordinate error of \u223c 0.15 \u00c5 based on maximum likelihood.23 Although solvent-directed nucleophilic attack during the deacylation stage of peptide hydrolysis by proteinases has been an unchallenged textbook concept, this is the first crystal structure that provides clear visual demonstration of such critical reaction step. Furthermore, the reaction pathway proposed here parallels the posited mechanism underlying the inhibition of chymotrypsin by chloromethyl ketone inhibitors.24 In the latter hypothesis, an epoxy ether intermediate, resulting from the internal displacement of the chloride by the oxyanion, is subsequently attacked (thus opened) by N\u03b52 of the histidine residue of the catalytic triad to form a second covalent linkage between the inhibitor and the His:Ser catalytic pair of chymotrypsin.",

The extrapolated angle of attack (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C=O), using the coordinates of the hydroxyl oxygen attached to the Ci atom and those of the carbonyl function in the episulfide bonding mode (the bona fide pre-attack scenario), is \u223c 115\u00b0. This angle is satisfyingly close to the calculated optimal angle (\u223c 109\u00b0) for nucleophilic addition onto carbonyl groups.25 The slightly larger angle in our structure may reflect either minor coordinate error or the fact that the attacking hydroxyl oxygen is still \u223c 2.3 \u00c5 from the P1 carbonyl carbon and separated by the Ci atom or both. During normal deacylation, the actual line of attack on the P1 carbonyl group by the hydrolytic water from its position observed in our \u201cdeacylating\u201d complex structure will be inevitably affected by the bulky S\u03b3 of Cys145. Therefore, the attacking angle of the hydrolytic water on P1 carbonyl of peptide substrates may change slightly from that estimated in the \u201cdeacylating\u201d complex. More importantly, the establishment of C-side entrance of the hydrolytic water and its position relative to His41 and Cys145 as observed in the deacylating complex are in accordance with the hypothesized \u201cminimal energy pathway\u201d mechanism, in which the solvent activation by N\u03b52 (His41) and re-protonation of S\u03b3 (Cys145) are tightly coordinated. The distance between N\u03b52 (His41) and S\u03b3 (Cys145) in the deacylating complex is 3.7 \u00c5, indicating that it is a better mimic of tetrahedral intermediate 2 (TI2) instead of TI2\u2032.26 This distance is longer than that between N\u03b52 (His57) and O\u03b3 (Ser195) in CLSPs, reflecting the larger size of S\u03b3\nversus O\u03b3 and the necessity to reduce possible steric hindrance between the hydrolytic water and the catalytic pair during its entrance into the active site from the S\u2032 sites.",

            "text": "In the active sites of CLSPs, the carboxylate of Asp102 (PPE numbering) forms hydrogen bonds with N\u03b41 of His57 and O\u03b3 of Ser214 (the S1 residue), whose carbonyl oxygen interacts with the amide nitrogen of the P1 residue via a hydrogen bond (Figure 5(a)). Adding the hydrogen bond between the carboxyl group of Asp102 and main chain amide of His57, the hydrogen bonding network converges on the catalytic histidine residue and was thought to couple acyl enzyme hydrolysis and product release. An extensive hydrogen bonding network involving the catalytic histidine residue is also observed in the crystal structures of coronaviral 3CLpro. However, coronaviral 3CL proteinases do not have an acidic residue as the third member of the catalytic triad; Asp187 (SARS 3CLpro numbering), the equivalent residue to Asp102 in CLSPs, does not interact directly with the catalytic His41. Instead, a solvent molecule is consistently observed in the vicinity of N\u03b41 of His41 in various coronaviral 3CLpro crystal structures.5., 6., 7., 8. In the deacylating complex, this water (WAT22) forms hydrogen bonds with N\u03b41 of His41 (2.5 \u00c5), N\u03b41 of His164 (2.9 \u00c5), O\u03b42 of Asp187 (2.7 \u00c5), and main-chain NH of His41 (3.3 \u00c5) (Figure 5(b)). In addition, the carbonyl oxygen of His164 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH of the P1-Glnc (3.0 \u00c5). Therefore, the solvent-directed hydrogen bonding network in SARS 3CLpro closely mimics the Ser214\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Asp102\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His57 interactions in the CLSPs. This suggests that SARS 3CLpro may employ a similar mechanism such as that proposed for the CLSPs underlying the concerted progression from acyl enzyme hydrolysis to product release. Interestingly, the residues in the picornaviral 3Cpro corresponding to Ser214 in the CLSPs are usually aliphatic (e.g. Val192 in HAV 3Cpro). This precludes the possibility of linking peptide substrate binding/dissociation to the catalytic events concerning the scissile bond via the hydrogen-bonding network described above.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that the solvent molecules hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 41 in the CLSPs (Thr41 in PPE) are involved in acyl enzyme hydrolysis (references in Perona et al.\n27). The distances between O of residue 41 and N\u03b52 of His57 are \u223c 7.0 \u00c5 in various CLSP crystal structures, implying that there are likely two water molecules bridging these two residues. This is indeed observed in the structure of the PPE-\u03b2-casomorphin (BCM7) acyl enzyme; the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr41 coordinates the hypothetical hydrolytic water (WAT317) through another solvent molecule (Figure 6(a)). This intermediary water (WAT318) forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the main-chain oxygen of Thr41 (2.7 \u00c5) and to WAT317 (2.7 \u00c5), which is at a distance of 2.9 \u00c5 from N\u03b52 of His57. We found a similar disposition of two water molecules in the active site of the thioacyl-like complex of the SARS 3CLpro. Thr26, the structurally equivalent residue of Thr41 in PPE, tightly binds a water molecule, WAT58 (\u223c 2.6 \u00c5) that interacts with another solvent molecule, WAT81. The distance between WAT81 and N\u03b52 of H41 in 3CLpro is 4.8 \u00c5, ruling out the possibility that this solvent molecule serves as the hydrolytic water. However, it is important to take into account that the observed position of WAT81 is a consequence of both the conformational change in the side-chain atoms of Cys145 and the intercalation of Ci between His41 and the carbonyl group of the P1 residue in the thioacyl-like complex (Figure 5(b)). Strikingly, although the amino acid identity of the structurally equivalent residues of Thr41 in PPE varies from virus to virus (Thr26 in SARS-CoV, Lys24 in HRV2, and Val28 in HAV), the relative position of their main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms with regard to the catalytic residues is highly conserved. This reiterated structural resemblance among viral cysteine proteinases and the CLSPs seems to strengthen the notion that their catalytic mechanisms are likely to be quite similar as well.",

The standard assay was performed using 50 nM 3CLpro, 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT in 100 \u03bcl at 37( \u00b1 0.1) \u00b0C in a small volume quartz cuvette. For competitive inhibition experiments, the inhibitor concentration was varied from 0.2 to 3 \u03bcM. Fluorescence data were empirically corrected for the inner filter effect.33 Fluorescence was measured using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a circulating water-bath. The reaction was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm (2.5 nm bandpass) and an emission wavelength of 420 nm (5 nm bandpass). Initial velocities were determined from a least-squares analysis of the linear portion of the progress curves (at least 1 min) using Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).",
