The canonical host proteins responsible for sensing or interacting with these foreign nucleic acids include the Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors1.

They are evolutionarily conserved from mammals to fish, with four well-characterized paralogues in humans: IFIT1 (also known as p56 and ISG56), IFIT2 (also known as p54 and ISG54), IFIT3 (also known as p60 and ISG60) and IFIT5 (also known as p58 and ISG58), ranging in mass from 54 to 56 kDa. IFITs are composed of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), degenerate helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motifs of 34 amino acids in length, which are usually present in multiple copies as tandem arrays that generate solenoid-type scaffolds well-suited for mediating protein\u2013protein interactions4 (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).",

Most of these functions are thought to occur through disruptive protein\u2013protein interactions between IFITs and host cellular factors. Through their TPRs, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were shown to inhibit key steps during translation initiation by interacting with the \u2018e\u2019 or \u2018c\u2019 subunits of eIF3 (refs 5, 6). However, the unexpected finding that IFITs can bind RNA suggested a more direct role: after infection or interferon stimulation, it was found that IFITs form large multiprotein complexes with other family members and several different RNA-binding proteins, leading to viral clearance2. Like RIG-I, productive binding of both IFIT1 and IFIT5 were shown to depend on the presence of cytosolic PPP-RNAs2,7,8. However, crystallographic and biochemical analyses of RIG-I bound to RNA revealed that it is a dsRNA-specific translocase9, which optimally interacts with blunt-ended PPP-RNA10,11,12,13,14,15. The mechanism by which IFITs recognize PPP-RNA is unknown.",

The structures reveal a novel arrangement of TPR domains that directly bind PPP-RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner and, to our knowledge, represent the first example of a TPR protein bound to a nucleic acid ligand. Structure-guided biochemical analysis of IFIT5 indicated that only single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) can be accommodated within the protein, which undergoes a compaction upon binding. Finally, functional analysis in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells reveals a reduction of viral replication only in the presence of proper PPP-RNA binding by IFIT1 or IFIT5.",

The structure of IFIT5 reveals a helical domain with approximate dimensions of 80 \u00c5 \u00d7 55 \u00c5 \u00d7 40 \u00c5 (Fig. 1a, b). In most multi-TPR-containing proteins, such as O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, the relationship between successive TPRs is regular and repeating, such that they form open-ended superhelical structures with distinct convex and concave surfaces4,16. In IFIT5, of its total 24 \u03b1-helices, 18 form canonical TPRs (TPRs 1\u20139; Fig. 1a), whereas the remaining 6 helices intervene between the TPRs such that the regular repeating relationship between them is disrupted. This results in the formation of three distinct bundles of TPRs (subdomains I, II and III) oriented with respect to one another to give the overall protein a relatively closed clamp-shaped structure (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 5a).",

This is facilitated by a connecting 17-residue loop (L1) containing a highly conserved Cys-His-Phe-Thr-Trp pentapeptide motif that is invariant among nearly all of the IFIT proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2), and forms a single turn of a helix that packs against the concave inner face of subdomain I (Supplementary Fig. 4).

All of the structures were similar, and therefore we initially describe the general features of the IFIT5-oligo-C complex as it was the highest resolution structure. Difference Fourier maps revealed strong positive electron density within the central positively charged pocket from which the 5\u2032-triphosphate and the first four nucleotides of the RNA could be reliably modelled (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The 5\u2032-triphosphate group is nestled deep within the pocket and makes a multitude of electrostatic interactions with protein side chains from helix \u03b12 (Glu 33, Thr 37 and Gln 41) located at the very base of the pocket, and residues from the concave inner surface of subdomain II (Lys 150, Tyr 250 and Arg 253) (Fig. 2c). Arg 187 in IFIT1 was previously identified to be required for RNA interaction; the homologous residue in IFIT5 (Arg 186) makes a weak salt-bridge with the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphates, and van der Waals contacts with the first ribose moiety. These RNA-interacting residues are for the most part conserved in sequence and structure between IFIT5 and IFIT1 (Supplementary Figs 2 and 7), the only IFITs that have been shown to bind PPP-RNA with strong affinity2. One notable exception is Thr 37, which is replaced in IFIT1 by Arg 38, suggesting slight differences in RNA recognition between IFIT1 and IFIT5. Conversely, in IFIT3, which is known to not bind PPP-RNA2, Tyr 250 is substituted with a negatively charged residue, Asp 242, and Arg 186 with His 182 (Supplementary Fig. 2), both of which would interfere directly with RNA binding.",

On the basis of ligand distances and geometry, the ion is probably Mg2+ from the in vitro transcription reactions, but could potentially also be Na+ (a component of the crystallization buffer). It is unlikely that capped messenger RNA (mRNA) can be accommodated within this pocket owing to size constraints. In addition, given the critical interactions made with the \u03b3-phosphate and the metal ion, the pocket is unlikely to accept 5\u2032-monophosphorylated or 5\u2032-hydroxylated RNA with considerable affinity.

Notably, the first two bases do not make any specific hydrogen bonds with protein residues and there is ample space adjacent to the pyrimidine ring edges, suggesting that the larger purine bases can also be easily accommodated (Fig. 3). The structure of the oligo-A complex confirms this notion and reveals that the adenine rings reach further out into the periphery making additional non-specific van der Waals contacts with Thr 371, His 374 and Phe 339, which were absent with the pyrimidine bases (Fig. 3b\u2013d).",

SAXS analysis revealed reductions in the radius of gyration (Rg, \u223c2.5 \u00c5), the maximum dimension (Dmax, \u223c25 \u00c5) and the volume (\u223c14,000 \u00c53) of the protein upon addition of RNA (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14). The scattering curves show good agreement between solution (Rg, 28.2 \u00c5) and crystal structure (Rg, 27.5 \u00c5) for the RNA-bound form (Supplementary Fig. 14h), in contrast to the unliganded form, which displays considerable differences (solution Rg, 30.6 \u00c5; crystal structure Rg, 28.3 \u00c5). This suggests that in solution, the unliganded protein is either more open or possibly flexible. To discern between these possibilities, we subjected the SAXS data to a Porod\u2013Debye analysis, which provides information on the degree of flexibility present in the scattering sample19. For both unliganded and RNA-bound IFIT5, the Porod\u2013Debye plot showed characteristic plateaus that indicate the presence of distinct conformations for both species (Supplementary Fig. 14k, l). Thus, unliganded IFIT5 probably exists in a more open conformation in solution than that observed in the crystal structure, facilitating RNA entry.",

Thus, the PPP-RNA-binding pocket identified here is probably involved in a similar mode of recognition in other IFIT family members.",

Consistent with the mutational analysis, IFIT5 mutants were impaired in their ability to restrict growth of vesicular stomatitis virus compared to wild-type IFIT5 (Fig. 5d). Similarly, IFIT1 lacking the ability to bind PPP-RNA was not able to inhibit the activity of an influenza virus polymerase (Fig. 5e), consistent with the notion that binding to PPP-RNA is critical for the antiviral activity of IFIT1.",

PPP-RNAs are found within the genome of negative-sense ssRNA viruses such as influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus. Other RNA viruses, such as positive-sense viruses which have 5\u2032-capped genomes, can also generate cytosolic PPP-RNAs as replicative intermediates during their life cycle. Hence, the evolution of a binding site to specifically recognize PPP-RNA allows IFITs to distinguish self from non-self RNAs, as cytosolic host ssRNAs bear a 5\u2032-monophosphate (on ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA)20,21 or are 5\u2032-capped (in the case of mRNA). In doing so, one possible mechanism for IFIT function may be to latch onto the ends of viral RNA, preventing it from being properly replicated or packaged into progeny virions.",
