All the recent global environmental assessments provide ample documentation for the rapid decline in the viability of life systems. The Living Planet Index (LPI) tells the story of life being extinguished at unprecedented rates (WWF 2008). This index measures the state of the world\u2019s biodiversity based on trends from 1970 to 2003 in 1,313 vertebrate species, comprising 695 terrestrial species, 274 marine species, and 344 freshwater species. The LPI shows an overall decline of 30% over the 33-year period\u2014reflecting declines in each of the major species groups. During the same period, global satellite imagery records rapidly eroding seascapes and landscapes, including the eutrophication of semi-enclosed seas and coastal areas, deforestation particularly in tropical regions, the desertification of arid lands, the near total desiccation of the Aral Sea, the draining of the Mesopotamian marshlands\u2014and the list goes on (MEA 2005). Add to these cases the rapid erosion of tropical coral reefs, the loss of boreal and coastal coniferous forests, the degradation and destruction of the world\u2019s grasslands and wetlands, marked deterioration of the world\u2019s lakes and rivers, the disappearance of coastal mangrove forests, and so forth, and an unequivocal picture emerges of many of the earth\u2019s major ecosystems in a state of imminent or present collapse.",

Here, we explore these implications by first reviewing the ways in which human activities have led to the breakdown of ecosystems, and how we can identify dysfunction in ecosystems as a consequence of anthropogenic stress. We then turn to the flip side of this topic and define healthy ecosystems and their main characteristics, looking at how the loss of ecosystem health impacts human health and at the efforts underway to address global health issues from an ecosystem perspective. Building on this, we argue that attention to the cultural dimensions of ecosystem health and dysfunction calls for an even more integrative perspective, embodied in the concept of \u2018eco-cultural health\u2019. By means of an illustrative example, we discuss how the breakdown of eco-cultural health impacts human health and well-being. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this perspective for public policy and action.",

From early on, it has been clear that the organizing principles for ecosystems are very different from those for organisms. The behavior of organisms is a product of natural selection. The behavior of ecosystems arises from the emergent properties of self-organizing systems (Rapport et al. 1985), which can yield multiple dynamic states (Levin 1998). However, both systems can become dysfunctional under certain conditions. Thus, without the need to make an analogy between ecosystems and organisms, one can recognize that both systems can be described in terms of their state of health (proper functioning) or pathology (dysfunction).",

Just as conservation biologists can assess biodiversity loss against situations that have prevailed in previous times, ecosystem health practitioners can assess the health of ecosystems by comparing metrics describing ecosystem properties (including biodiversity) under conditions prior to the onset of anthropogenic stress with conditions that prevail under stress. This can be done objectively without the need to invoke human values or goals (Rapport and Whitford 1999).",

This situation may give rise to another objection to the notion of ecosystem health, insofar as ecosystems under anthropogenic stress do not \u201cdie\u201d but transform to alternative states. However, this objection is somewhat of a \u2018red herring\u2019, in that it ignores the well-established phenomenon that anthropogenic stress severely compromises the structure and functions of ecosystems, rendering them less capable of sustaining the diversity of life, including human life.

This has resulted in significant changes in both the grass and rodent communities, along with substantial losses of biodiversity and productivity, greater vulnerability to invasive species, and so forth. In this sense, it might be argued that this is merely a case of a healthy grassland turning into a healthy desert. Yet, this transformation represents a degraded condition compared with the initial state. A desert ecosystem\u2014healthy or not\u2014is less supportive of life than a grassland. Furthermore, in this case, the desert itself continues to degrade over time, becoming less and less supportive of life in all its forms.

When modern humans first appeared, approximately 200,000 years ago, the most likely causes of mortality included encounters with predators, famine, and vector-borne diseases. With the gradual shift from hunting and gathering to agrarian societies, beginning 8,000\u201310,000 years ago, new kinds of health threats appeared, particularly the rise in infectious diseases, as larger numbers of people began to live in closer proximity to one another in settlements and villages. With the further development of agriculture, towns and eventually city states emerged\u2014with correspondingly larger density of population. This situation gave rise to contamination of water from human and animal waste, and thus to an increase in water-borne diseases (e.g., diarrhea), and multiplied the potential for more deadly contagious diseases. In the Middle Ages, great plagues swept through Europe. The \u201cBlack Death\u201d, a bubonic plague, ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1353, reducing its population by at least one-third.3\n",

Table 1 illustrates some of the implications of ecological imbalance for global health. What is striking is the multiplicity of routes by which ecological imbalance results in increased disease prevalence\u2014in terms of both the resurgence of infectious and water-borne diseases and the emergence of novel diseases. The table also shows that the rise in disease prevalence as a sign of EDS significantly impacts our own species.\n",

From an ecosystem health perspective, each individual is part of an environment that includes family, community, society, ecosystems, and the biosphere. It is this larger interactive matrix that, as we have seen, is often decisive in the spread of pathogens, or even in the origin of emerging diseases. Adopting an ecosystem health approach presents the physician with two additional critical questions: (e) \u201cWhy does this patient have this disease?\u201d and (f) \u201cWhat can I do to prevent others from having this disease?\u201d",

Rather, through programs of this nature, a new generation of medical practitioners is made increasingly aware of the importance of healthy ecosystems to human health.

Parallel to the cardinal features of healthy ecosystems described above, the key characteristics of eco-cultural health have been described in terms of:\nOrganization The alignment of cultural institutions and practices with the maintenance of biotic composition, interactions and integration;\nVitality The capacity of the system to sustain itself (transmit/reproduce) so that its potential for life in both nature and culture is undiminished; and\nResilience The maintenance of coping mechanisms in nature and culture to enable rebound from ecological and social disturbance, such as drought, floods, epidemics, conflict, etc. (Rapport and Maffi 2010).\n",

As we will show by way of example in the next section, it is the breakdown of the complex interdependencies built, over centuries or even millennia, between people and ecosystems that accounts for many if not most of the cases of ecosystem and societal collapse we have witnessed in the past and are increasingly witnessing today, along with increased disease vulnerability for humans and other species.",

Inner Mongolia contains five major grasslands, each with its unique ecology and history of human activity. The Horquin Sandy Lands in northeastern Inner Mongolia have been periodically occupied by Mongolian nomadic herders for many thousands of years. Over this period, the herders developed their nomadic lifestyle, adapting to the ecology of the grasslands by moving their herds (sheep, goats, horses, and camels) as seasonal grasses became available. In this way they maintained low grazing pressure, which sustained the health of the grasslands and their culture. However, at least three times over the past 8,000 years (including at present), the symbiotic relationship between nature and culture was interrupted by large-scale influx of farmers and sedentary pastoralists, which transformed the grassland into vast agricultural lands. Each time, once the limited soil nutrients were depleted, the grasslands became desertified, and were abandoned for millennia. When the soil and vegetation rebounded, the regenerated system was weaker than that of the previous cycle.",

This cycle is the outcome of twin pressures on the land both from the influx of farmers and pastoralists, converting large areas of the grasslands to agriculture, and from government-imposed restrictions on the movements of Mongolian nomadic herders, resulting in the intensification of grazing pressures. Since the 1950s, more than 2.5 million hectares of grasslands in the Horqin Sandy Lands have been converted to farmland, and farming activities have expanded to the northern frontier areas. In recent times, farms have been abandoned owing to nutrient decline, and seasonal wind storms blow off remaining soils and expose underlying sand, leading to dune mobilization. By the late 1950s, 28% of the land in the Horqin steppe had become desert; by the mid-1970s, this area had increased to 53%, and by the end of the 1980s it stood at 78% (Liu et al. 2003). As of 2006, for Inner Mongolia as a whole, an estimated 90% of grasslands have been degraded to some degree\u2014more than twice the amount of a decade earlier\u2014while productivity of disturbed grasslands stood at only 50% of the productivity of the undisturbed steppe (Jiang et al. 2006).",

Desertification has resulted in reduced populations of megafauna, including Mongolian gazelle, roe deer, foxes, and wolves. It has also threatened the livelihoods of both the farmers/pastoralists and the Mongolian nomadic peoples. As croplands are abandoned and dunes mobilized, people are being forced to exploit marginal lands for growing crops (such as along the margins of river beds), and towns have been overtaken and abandoned. As the sands advance, grazing lands are progressively reduced, adding to the adverse political conditions that threaten the continuation of ecosystem-friendly nomadic ways of life. The health of millions of people in Inner Mongolia is under severe threat, owing to increasingly harsh environments, declining availability of food and water, severe respiratory problems and eye infections from dust and sand storms, exposure to contaminants (including toxic substances and heavy metals) and pathogens (such as TB, flu virus, and hantavirus) carried by dust, and other ills (Griffin et al. 2001; Ellis 2007; Pimentel et al. 2007). The grasslands of many regions of Inner Mongolia are likely to be well beyond the point of self-repair, leaving little hope for the improvement in the health and well-being of people. These conditions will increase the likelihood of abandonment of the region by both the Mongolian herders and immigrant Han farmers. Restoration efforts have thus far proved of very limited success. What is needed are much more concerted efforts and political will to restore eco-cultural health to the region.",

Good governance is essential to achieve communal goals relevant to the use, management and conservation of the environment for human well-being and the benefit of all life. Often, as Eleanor Ostrom and colleagues have shown (Ostrom 1990; Ostrom et al. 1999; Dietz et al. 2003), governance decisions made through consensus-building within local communities are more effective in preventing the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 (i.e., the degradation of open-access resources; Hardin 1968) than decisions made by a remote regional or national authority that lacks the intimacy of local knowledge. At national and regional levels, good governance must rely upon appropriate tools for assessing and forecasting trends in eco-cultural health, in order to identify the main threats to the health of both ecosystems and people and their implications for sustaining life. There are some promising examples. In recent years, recognition of the importance of this broader perspective gave rise to an agreement among the leaders of the Mesoamerican countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras) to take collective action to mitigate the deterioration in the off-shore Mesoamerican coral reef, based not only on ecological considerations, but as well on cultural, socio-economic, governance, and public health dimensions (World Bank 2006).",

Addressing this challenge requires an integrative approach that takes into account all the components of eco-cultural systems. Strategies that focus on single issues\u2014be they economic, public health, or ecological\u2014in isolation of others are bound to fail. To be sure, eco-cultural systems are of immense complexity, and their dynamics invariably include thresholds that can trigger sudden and unpredictable non-linear transformations (Rapport and Regier 1995; Levin 1998; Lyytim\u00e4ki and Hild\u00e9n 2007). However, as the framework for analysis must match the complexity of the problem, ecologists must develop the capacity to work closely with those in the social and health sciences to approach these issues from an integrative, transdisciplinary perspective. In this paper, we have suggested that the concept of \u2018health\u2019 is a fundamental property of life systems in nature and culture, and that sustaining life will require a perspective that identifies key indicators of healthy eco-cultural systems, delineates the pathways and mechanisms by which eco-cultural health can be compromised, and sets polices that will be effective in restoring health to the world\u2019s eco-cultural systems. The further evolution and articulation of the nature and parameters of eco-cultural health will contribute to this vital societal objective.",
