            "text": "Smooth muscle in the fetal airway exhibits spontaneous phasic contractions that are identified in a variety of mammals including chickens, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, and humans [1\u20135]. Phasic contractions occur when the muscle shortens rapidly to produce spontaneous contraction [6]. Such phasic activity of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) was first described more than 80 years ago and is thought to act as a developmental modulator, promoting lung growth through mechanotransduction pathways [7,8]. After birth, ASM produces predominately tonic force [9\u201311], a sustained contractile response [6], however, phasic ASM activity is also reported in adult animals and humans [11,12]. No data exist on when and to what extent ASM transitions from a phasic to a tonic contractile phenotype.",

In the context of disease, the \u201cpostnatal reversion to prenatal phenotype hypothesis\u201d attributes spontaneous bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients to a phasic pattern of ASM contraction, albeit over a longer time-scale than in the prenatal lung [7].

Phasic smooth muscle activity is typically more distinctive in single-unit musculature such as esophageal and intestinal smooth muscle where action potentials are generated [18]. Onset of phasic activity in ASM is not clearly understood but circumferential waves of calcium oscillations are documented in mature ASM [19,20]. While the frequency of calcium oscillation increases the amplitude of ASM contraction, the contractile response is predominantly tonic rather than phasic in nature [21]. There is evidence of spontaneously activated cells within the ASM layer [22] and also of gap junctions [23] that may propagate an activation signal. The presence of spontaneously active cells and gap junctions, therefore, provides a theoretical mechanistic framework for the emergence of phasic ASM contraction at any stage of life.",

A variety of behaviors including oscillations are observed when Tr is large but pa and g are low, as the model produces isolated clusters of active cells, but these clusters do not interact (Fig. 5(b)). The most interesting behavior is the sporadic oscillations with large Tr, but very low pa and medium g (Fig. 5(c)). The sporadic oscillations shown in Fig. 5(c) suggest that the system rarely reaches the threshold to initiate a measurable contraction because pa is low. However, synchronization occurs (albeit suboptimal) if a low pa is combined with a relatively strong g to produce a more coherent interaction among activated clusters, leading to a propagating contraction wave.",

Gap junctions identified in the airway presumably allow for coordinated phasic contractions [8,32].",

The two most important parameters in the model were the probability of cell activation and the strength of cell to cell coupling, which correspond, respectively, to spontaneous muscle activation and gap junctions. The degree of cell to cell coupling (g) appears to play a critical role in the generation of phasic activity, since phasic activity could be mimicked with very low cell excitation as long as cell to cell coupling was strong (Figs. 4(d)\u20134(f)). These results suggest that the transition from a phasic to a tonic ASM phenotype with maturation could be simulated by gradually decreasing the strength of cell to cell coupling. If we assume that changes in coupling in the model are reflective of ASM gap junctions, a reduction in gap junction expression with age is a testable hypothesis that has a basis in other tissue types. For example, endothelial gap junctions are maximally expressed in rat aorta at birth, with gap junction expression declining within the first week of life [33].",

Cyclical activation of ASM cells is not purely restricted to intrinsic pacemaker activity, but may instead be pharmacologically mediated. For example, charybdotoxin-induced oscillatory contraction in guinea pig airways is regulated by activation of the cyclooxygenase two enzyme and downstream production of prostaglandins [34]. In murine airways, tetraethylammonium chloride induced oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ and force were produced cooperatively by L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, voltage-dependent Na+ channels, Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 channels, Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchanger, Na+/K+ ATPase, release from Ca2+ stores mediated by inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, and extracellular Ca2+ [35]. Whether phasic ASM contraction occurs appears dependent on the frequency of Ca2+ oscillation, wherein frequencies exceeding 40 cycles/min produce sustained (tonic) contraction [30] and phasic ASM contraction at much lower frequencies [31]. The frequency of contraction observed in the present study ranged from 0.5 to 5.3 contractions/min (Fig. 3) in sheep airways which in the future should be compared with direct measurements of intracellular Ca2+ over the same time period. Irrespectively, the model parameter (pa) should not be considered a specific representation of pacemaker activity, but any pathway that leads to spontaneous cell activation and thereafter latency.",

While the biological mechanism associated with phasic contraction is the average single cell contractility that is responsible for the full airway contractility [31], the mechanism of contraction in our model is wave propagation (Fig. 4). This finding raises the possibility that phasic behavior is a network phenomenon arising from cell\u2013cell interactions, rather than molecular mechanisms of single cell contractions. This idea of network behavior reproduced all of the measured data features, provided the cell\u2013cell interaction parameter g decreased with age. In the absence of relevant data for ASM, we chose the simplest mathematical relation between g and age: g = 1/age. While other forms could be explored, this simple relation produced behavior similar to the data (Fig. 3 versus Fig. 6). As the strength of cell\u2013cell coupling is reduced with age, the probability that an activated cell induces a full wave is also reduced. Hence, both the frequency and amplitude, and hence, the intensity, of the waves decrease with age. It is noteworthy that the model also predicted that the SD of amplitude has a peak (data not shown) because with decreasing age, cell\u2013cell coupling becomes stronger and all waves begin to be synchronized with similar amplitudes. Such a full synchronization is only rarely seen in the experimental data (see first 2 min in Fig. 2(a)). Nevertheless, the SD of intensity, being the product of amplitude and frequency, still shows a strong decrease with age, in agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 7).",

Jesudason draws a creative link between asthma and phasic ASM contraction [7]. Transient airflow limitation, which is a primary characteristic of asthma [36], is conceptually similar to the rhythmic mechanical response associated with phasic ASM contraction. The hypothesis proposed by Jesudason states that reversion to a prenatal ASM phenotype contributes to asthma onset [7]. Given the early life presentation of asthma, we further speculate that phasic ASM contraction may never completely transition in individuals at risk of asthma development. There is now an abundance of evidence to suggest that a number of prenatal factors contribute to asthma development including fetal growth kinetics [37\u201339], preterm birth [40], and intrauterine infection [41]. Deficits in airway function at birth and in childhood are independent risk factors for the development of asthma [42,43]. Wheezing, an apparent symptomatic expression of airflow limitation, is common in infants [44]. Notably, wheezing phenotypes also include transient wheeze [45] which is perhaps most analogous to phasic ASM contraction. An unanswered question is whether the established associations between adverse events in early life and asthma are mediated by a direct effect on airway function that may include persistence of or regression to phasic ASM contraction.",

Males were only available in the 1-yr-old group, while 5-yr-old females were studied as these were the mother ewes of the younger groups. Younger groups comprised both male and female lambs. Recent studies have raised the possibility of sex differences in ASM behavior and the role of sex hormones in the etiology of asthma is acknowledged [46]. Indeed, there is a sex-dependent shift in asthma prevalence from childhood to adulthood; the prevalence of asthma is greater in boys than girls during early childhood, but this trend is reversed after puberty [47]. It seems less likely that sex differences will be expressed at the level of the isolated airway in vitro, where normal regulation from external stimuli is lost. For example, while male sex hormones increase airway responsiveness to cholinergic stimulation via a vagus nerve-mediated reflex mechanism, contractile response of isolated tracheal and bronchial ring segments to carbachol are not different between males and females [48]. No obvious differences were observed between males and females in the present study, further, any sex differences cannot explain a decrease in phasic activity with age. Therefore, conclusions drawn from this study are not expected to be different if sex was controlled across groups.",

            "text": "The computational model is a simple statistical model devised to primarily investigate how the assembly of simple contractile units in the presence of varying neighbor interactions behave. We thus neglected all internal molecular mechanisms that participate in force generation. We also did not specify the nature of cell\u2013cell interactions which might include information flowing through gap junctions, calcium waves, or mechanical force-induced signaling that can lead to cell activation [19,23,49]. For example, when a cell is in the activated state, it may release mediators as well as produce localized force that can affect the activation state of the neighbor cell. These processes may take time which may in part be represented by the period associated with the refractory period Tr. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the ASM cell does not have a refractory period. To test the effect of Tr on model results, we carried out various complementary simulations and found that Tr = 0 was not different from Tr = 1 suggesting that the refractory period is not an essential component of the model. Another simplification is the assumption that axial forces do not contribute to the expelled volume during a full airway contraction. Finally, the effects of the extracellular matrix were also neglected. Contractile forces can propagate through the collagen fibers to neighboring as well as more distal cells potentially influencing their activation. However, as the extracellular matrix strengthens during maturation [50], its stiffness is expected to increase with potential effects on ASM phenotype and contractility. Despite all the simplicity of our minimal model, it was able to qualitatively reproduce the experimental data. Hence, we believe our minimal model captures some aspects of the transition of a full airway from phasic to tonic contractile phenotype.",

Model simulations suggest that changes in cell\u2013cell coupling account for the transition from a phasic to a tonic ASM phenotype which should be further tested in future experimental studies. Owing to the broad similarity in transient airflow obstruction in asthma and phasic ASM contraction activity, abnormalities in the normal phenotypic transition to tonic contraction may be of relevance to asthma pathogenesis.",
