In the first step, the E1 enzyme binds Ub and ATP, and catalyzes Ub C-terminal acyl-adenylation to form E1:Ub~AMP. (The tilde [~] is used to indicate a reactive covalent bond, while the colon [:] indicates a noncovalent complex.)

Protein expression, as indicated by western blot or proteomics techniques, cannot therefore be used reliably to infer enzyme activity. Turnover of the natural substrate provides a direct measurement of activity but requires detection of the reaction products, which may be challenging in a complex cellular environment. Additionally, different enzymes often process the same substrate, making it difficult to assign activity to a particular enzyme. Activity-based probes (ABPs) mimic substrate, but rather than being processed by the enzyme, they become covalently attached to the active site in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. As ABPs do not react with inactive enzymes, the extent of probe labeling is an indirect measure of enzyme activity. ABPs are particularly well suited for studying enzymes with nucleophilic catalytic residues, as a reactive electrophile can be incorporated into the probe to react covalently with the nucleophile.

Related Ubl-VS probes for NEDD8, ISG-15, SUMO-1, GATE-16, GABARAP, MAP1-LC3, and Apg8L were reported shortly thereafter [10, 37] . A wide range of C-terminal electrophiles have since been investigated, as summarized in Table 1 .

(An acid-cleavable conjugate formed between an E1 and an ABP is discussed below [41] .)

That is to say, do they target only active DUBs, or will they label DUBs regardless of whether the enzyme is in a catalytically active form? In several instances, DUB reactivity toward a probe has been shown to change after a stimulus without a change in DUB expression, suggesting the probe does indeed target only the active subpopulation of the enzyme. For example, treating cells with hydrogen peroxide reduces the labeling of some DUBs by Ub-VS or Ub-VME, due to oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue [45, 46] . More revealingly, a study by Naik and Dixit showed that the catalytic activity of USP9X is activated by phosphorylation upon T-cell receptor activation. Brief stimulation of T cells increased the labeling of USP9X by HA-Ub-VS without an increase in USP9X levels, while the phospho-site [42, 43] Fluoromethyl ketone SUMO-FMK ii [44] a-Amino-b-lactone Ub-Lac [42] Chloromethyl ketone - [31] mutant, which still possess a potentially reactive active site Cys residue, was much less reactive toward the probe following stimulation. Hence, the probe can distinguish between active and inactive forms of USP9X [47] . Probe labeling could also give a misleading indication of activity if the reaction occurs on noncatalytic residues. In the case of OTUB1, HA-Ub-VS reacts preferentially at a noncatalytic Cys, so probe labeling does not indicate deubiquitinating activity [48], but it is not clear if this is a more widespread phenomenon. Therefore, when interpreting experiments using Ubelectrophile conjugates, researchers should be aware of the possibility of activity-independent labeling arising from the electrophilic nature of the probe.

In this compound, SUMO1-AVSN, the acyl-phosphate linkage of SUMO1~AMP is replaced with a vinyl sulfonamide. They also developed an unreactive SUMO~AMP mimic incorporating an unreactive acyl-sulfamide (SUMO1-AMSN). Structures of SUMO E1 bound to the two compounds revealed major differences in protein architecture. The initial E1:SUMO-AMSN complex adopts an 'open' conformation, in which the active site is organized for ATP binding and the catalytic Cys is buried and far from the SUMO adenylate. By contrast, the covalent complex E1~SUMO-AVSN adopts a 'closed' conformation with a radically different active site: residues involved in catalyzing the first step have been 'swapped' for those required for the transesterification reaction. Therefore, E1 enzymes appear not to have two spatially distinct active sites; rather, the region around the SUMO C terminus and AMP is remodeled after the adenylation reaction in order to catalyze transesterification.

To overcome these limitations, An and Statsyuk developed an alternative probe design which used a dehydroalanine (Dha) moiety in place of a vinyl sulfone to trap the catalytic Cys, simplifying synthesis and preserving the C-terminal sequence of the Ubl ('Ub-Probe3', Fig. 4A ) [109] .

The authors designed an AMP mimic which would react with the E1~Ub complex to form a stable AMP~Ub analog. As both the adenylation and transthiolation steps must have occurred prior to probe reaction, formation of the AMP~Ub analog reports on E1 activity.
