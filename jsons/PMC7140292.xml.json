Knowledge of prior or recent infections of the head and neck is important. History of a known tick bite prompts suspicion for tick-borne illnesses in a child with a neck mass, with the specific illness depending on geographic region of residence. Bartonella henselae or toxoplasmosis play an important role in human pathogenicity, and should be considered if there has been exposure to a cat or cat feces. For those with a history of unpasteurized milk product ingestion or contaminated soil exposure, those from endemic regions, those with immunocompromised state, and/or a history of tuberculosis (TB) exposure, etiologic considerations would include atypical mycobacteria, TB, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respectively. A patient history of head or neck radiation should be considered. Family history is also key, because disorders with a clear hereditary pattern such as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, neurofibromatosis, head and neck cancers, autoimmune disorders, or vascular anomalies may be linked to the patient\u2019s presenting neck lesion.",

Benign characteristics include mobility within the soft tissue plane (rather than fixed), well-circumscribed, and small in size. It is important to know if any illness or trauma preceded the mass. Does the lesion fluctuate in size and, if so, what prompts these changes? Drainage or pitting would suggest congenital fistula or deep abscess. If a midline mass elevates with swallowing or tongue protrusion, a thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) would be likely. In pediatric patients, biopsy is more frequently pursued in larger lesions that persist several weeks, do not resolve with antibiotic therapy, are fixed, or are in the supraclavicular fossa.",

Examination of the oral cavity may reveal mucosal or dental lesions that may also contribute to formation of neck masses. Meticulous neck examination, beyond the mass itself, including thyroid inspection and palpation, is fundamental. A gross cranial nerve assessment should also be performed.

It is appropriate to culture any material expressed from an abscess or from any surface lesion, that is, a nasaopharyngeal culture for increasingly more common respiratory viruses such as metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, or tonsillar culture if group A streptococcus is suspected. A B henselae immunofluorescence assay blood test assesses for cat scratch disease if there is a history of such an incident or exposure. Toxoplasma gondii antibodies (immunoglobulins G and M) should be considered if applicable, as well as Lyme and ehrlichiosis titers, HIV testing, tuberculin skin testing, and a chest radiograph, if the TB test is positive. Acid-fast bacilli testing is important in confirming atypical mycobacteria. If thyroid involvement is probable, a thyroid panel may be considered. Further workup largely depends on the location and characteristics of a lesion. If an abscess is present, fine needle aspiration with a Gram stain would be recommended, to facilitate directed antibiotic therapy, along with acid-fast bacilli staining for mycobacteria, if suspected. Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will often be deemed necessary for upper airway evaluation. If neoplasm is present, laboratory tests and excisional biopsy are confirmatory of diagnosis, and appropriate referrals will need to be made for multidisciplinary management.",

Color Doppler ultrasound examination can demonstrate the vascularization of the mass, displaced normal surrounding vessels, or intralesional flow.3 However, ultrasound examination findings may not allow definitive characterization, especially for deeper lesions.3 CT scanning aids in the morphologic characterization and staging of neck masses, and allows for the precise visualization of fine bone structures, calcifications, and deep soft tissue compartments that cannot be demonstrated with ultrasound examination.3 Particular attention should be paid to minimizing the radiation exposure of CT scans, particularly in pediatric patients.3 MRI, with an absence of ionizing radiation and multiplanar capability, offers superior contrast resolution in evaluating masses in complex areas, including the head and neck.3 CT scanning is a more rapid study than MRI, but either modality may require intravenous sedation for younger patients.3\n",

They are midline lesions that arise as the result of a residual tract left by the thyroid gland during its embryologic descent from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue, downward to its definitive position1 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n). TDCs characteristically elevate with tongue protrusion or swallowing.1 They are very well-circumscribed, mobile, and nontender. Often, TDCs go unrecognized until they enlarge in response to an infection; therefore, the most common age of presentation is in young, school-aged children.1 MRI or CT scans can delineate the full extent of the lesion for perioperative planning; however, ultrasound imaging may be sufficient for radiologic assessment of a central neck mass with a high suspicion for TDC.1 Confirmation of normally functional thyroid tissue before TDC resection is also accomplished through preoperative imaging. Once confirmed, a Sistrunk procedure is typically performed, which involves surgical resection of the cystic lesion, along with the entire tract of embryologic descent, up to and including the tract insertion onto a portion of the hyoid bone, thus drastically reducing the rate of TDC recurrence.1 This type of surgical intervention is curative in the majority of patients.",

Dermoid cysts are lined by epithelium and differ from epidermoid cysts in that they contain skin appendages such as sebaceous glands and hair follicles within the cyst wall.4 Dermoids may present in later childhood owing to their slow evolution. Forty percent of dermoid and epidermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, with the majority of the remaining 60% of these cysts presenting before the age of 5 years.1 On noncontrast CT, a dermoid cyst usually appears as a low-density, unilocular, well-circumscribed mass.4 Fat, mixed-density fluid, and calcification (<50%) may also be seen, and there may be coalescence of fat into small nodules within the cystic lesion, giving a \u201csack of marbles\u201d appearance (Fig. 6\n).4 The presence of calcifications and cystic spaces in these lesions aids in their differentiation from lipomas.4 Patients respond well to surgical excision, which is typically curative.",

An internal laryngocele presents more commonly in infancy as stridor, respiratory distress, feeding problems, and/or chronic cough. In the pediatric population, external laryngocele most commonly presents during the teen years in conjunction with playing a musical instrument that requires increased laryngeal pressure, such as the trumpet. External laryngoceles may form a visible or palpable mass in the neck.11 Evaluation, particularly with presenting symptoms of airway compromise, may require fiberoptic or direct laryngoscopy. A CT scan with contrast is the most accurate imaging modality for defining spatial relationships between a laryngocele and laryngeal structures, as well as extralaryngeal soft tissues, in differentiating a laryngocele from other cystic formations, and in identifying the coexistence of any laryngeal malignancy11 (Fig. 13\n). Management, based on severity of symptoms, may include respiratory support with the possible need for intubation and/or tracheostomy, observation, cyst decompression via needle aspiration, endoscopic resection, or resection through an external approach.11\n",

The cutaneous lesions are generalized, vary from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter, and range from 50 to 500 in number. Visceral lesions are most commonly found in the liver, central nervous system, intestine, and lungs. Skeletal involvement has also been reported. Approximately 60% of infants with diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis die during the first few months of life owing to high-output cardiac failure, hemorrhage, or central nervous system involvement.1 Steroid therapy is thought to accelerate involution of diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis lesions.15\n",
