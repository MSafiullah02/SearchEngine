The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health officials to utilise the most comprehensive, accurate and timely information available to manage the rapidly evolving COVID-19 environment. High performance sport is a unique context that may look towards comprehensive testing as a means of risk mitigation. Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks. Finally, a review of the available technology that could be considered for use by medical staff at the point of care (PoC) in a high-performance sporting context is included.",

Sport is an important part of society and has a key role to play in restoring normality after the initial wave of COVID-19. In the current environment, sport organisations and athletes are faced with complex decisions regarding the resumption of training and sporting activities, particularly in high performance/professional sport where athletes are effectively returning to work. Unique and intrinsic characteristics of high performance/professional sport include sharing facilities and equipment and close and prolonged physical contact between teammates and opponents. These factors coupled with maximal levels of physical exertion, which likely increase aerosol generation, are conducive to the spread of infectious diseases. The overriding priority for high performance/professional sport, must ensure that any return to activity does not endanger athletes, staff and the public. A proactive risk management strategy including protocols for a possible case of COVID-19 must be in place.",

Testing of asymptomatic persons has been proposed in other higher risk situations as an effective means to mitigate workforce shortages such as in healthcare (1) . Large scale testing and isolation of asymptomatic individuals has the potential to substantially reduce the prevalence of COVID-19. Mass polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of 300 people was undertaken in an Italian town and all positive cases were isolated. As a result, people with COVID-19 symptoms reduced by 90% in 10 days (2) . Structuring testing for early identification of asymptomatic carriage as well as probable and confirmed cases is the best approach to mitigate increased risks associated with the high-performance sporting environment in areas of widespread local transmission.",
