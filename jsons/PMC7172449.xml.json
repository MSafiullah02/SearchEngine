            "text": "Viral infections of the respiratory tract are responsible for significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in children (Mulholland, 2003). The viral respiratory pathogens that are commonly recognised include rhinoviruses (HRV), coronaviruses (HCoV), influenza viruses (IFV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenoviruses (ADV). However, despite exhaustive investigation, a significant proportion of respiratory infections cannot be accounted for by these viruses, suggesting that additional respiratory pathogens are still likely to exist (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003). Over the last 6 years, the search for these agents has led to the detection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (van den Hoogen et al., 2001), human coronaviruses, SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003), NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005), human bocavirus (HBoV) (Allander et al., 2005) and very recently, human KI polyomavirus (KIV) (Allander et al., 2007).",

Different family members infect several species of mammals, including humans, other primates, rodents, rabbits as well as birds. Before KI virus, two human polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) were described which are ubiquitous worldwide (Stolt et al., 2003). Although it is postulated that these polyomaviruses utilise a respiratory route for transmission, detection of their nucleic acids in the respiratory tract is rare (Goudsmit et al., 1982, Sundsfjord et al., 1994). Normally infection with JCV and BKV in immunocompetent hosts results in asymptomatic infection, but in the immunocompromised these viruses may cause significant disease. JCV may be the cause of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while BK virus has been associated with tubular nephritis in renal transplant recipients and haemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients (Arthur et al., 1986). Following primary infection, these viruses may persist in the kidney and can periodically re-emerge in the host (Behzad-Behbahani et al., 2004, Markowitz et al., 1993). Following the report describing KIV, we sought to determine the presence of this virus in a well-characterised population of respiratory samples collected from Queensland subjects with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI).",

Our results showed that the majority of positive detections were made in the Australian winter months (May\u2013July).
