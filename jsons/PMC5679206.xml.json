The most commonly identified viruses in exacerbation of COPD include rhinovirus, influenza viruses, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus. Among them, rhinovirus and metapneumovirus are the most common viral pathogens in studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).12, 13, 25 In these studies, rhinovirus was detected in 8% to 44% in the events of COPD acute exacerbation. Influenza vaccination rate can also affect the prevalence. A Hong Kong study showed that influenza was the most common virus in hospitalized patients with COPD; meanwhile, a cohort from a London outpatient clinic showed low prevalence due to relatively high influenza vaccination rate (74%).11, 15 Many COPD exacerbations also include virus and bacteria coinfection. Approximately 25% of the hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbations showed coinfection. The clinical impact of coinfection is longer hospital stay and severe functional impairment.28\n",

            "text": "Symptoms of COPD exacerbation include cough, increased sputum volume and purulence, and dyspnea; however, it is not easy to differentiate viral and nonviral causes of COPD exacerbation by symptoms. Typical \u201ccommon-cold\u201d symptoms, including fever, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea, are prevalent in patients with COPD when virus is detected, but those symptoms also can be noted in nonviral exacerbation, so their usefulness in diagnosis remains limited.13, 29 Sputum purulence has been suggested as evidence for bacterial infection in COPD exacerbation, but sputum also can be purulent due to neutrophilia irrespective of causal organism.30 Furthermore, almost all COPD exacerbations can be marked with change in sputum characteristics.31 Therefore, the sputum characteristics are not a useful marker to differentiate viral and bacterial infection. On the other hand, sputum purulence may be used to decide the usage of antibiotics.32 Although neutrophils are the predominantly increased cell type in sputum during COPD exacerbations, one report showed increased eosinophilia during viral exacerbations.28 Viral exacerbations also are associated with frequent exacerbations, severe exacerbations, and a prolonged time for symptom recovery.13 Viruses also can be detected in stable COPD. Patients with RSV infection had higher plasma fibrinogen, serum interleukin (IL)-6, and hypercapnia in stable state.13 This suggests that asymptomatic viral colonization can potentially have a role in chronic inflammation and disease progression of COPD. Another study that supports this showed a relationship between frequent RSV detection and accelerated lung function decline (101.4 mL/y vs 51.2 mL/y, P = .01).33 It has been proposed that the alveolar epithelial cells of smokers and patients with severe emphysema are more frequently latently infected with adenovirus as compared with smokers without airflow obstruction.34, 35 They found COPD lung epithelial cells express adenoviral E1A protein, and that this was associated with specific lung inflammation. The investigators propose such adenoviral infections in patients with COPD contribute to the amplification of the lung inflammatory responses.",

Without PCR, these viruses cannot be identified. As a result, early studies using other diagnostic methods underestimated the prevalence of rhinovirus.15 Among various methods to obtain samples, such as nasal lavage, throat swab, or induced sputum, it is not yet evident which method is superior. Some viruses, especially RSV, can directly invade the lower respiratory tract; therefore, obtaining a simultaneous lower respiratory tract sample can increase the sensitivity of these assays. The big challenge of this molecular diagnostic approach is that it cannot discriminate causative organisms from colonization.",

The hygiene hypothesis is focused on a lack of TH1 stimulation that caused an overactive TH2 response and could lead to a more allergic immune response. What role viruses play in the TH2 response has been long debated and studied. Whether early viral infections set in motion a TH2-driven immune response or whether a lack of a TH1 response causes a more symptomatic response to viral infections has been unclear. Similarly, the debate over whether an asthma exacerbation is the result of an immune-deficient response or an exaggerated immune response continues.

Although the antimicrobial peptide, alpha defensing, was found to be increased in the epithelium and the peripheral blood,91 using multiplex PCR and pan-viral microarray discovery platform and next-generation deep sequencing to increase viral detection sensitivity, viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute IPF exacerbations. Four of 43 patients with IPF acute exacerbations had evidence of common respiratory viral infections (2 rhinovirus, 1 coronavirus, 1 parainfluenza), whereas no viruses were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from stable patients.92 Interestingly, torque teno virus (TTV), a relatively new single-stranded DNA virus, was found to be more common in patients with acute exacerbations than in stable controls. However, TTV also can be detected in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, suggesting that this virus is not specific to IPF. Deep sequencing of the lungs from patients with acute exacerbation of IPF did not reveal any evidence for viral pathogens.",

It is still possible viral associations have not been clearly proven due to the timing of sampling of IPF patients during their exacerbations or possible incorrect compartment sampling to identify viruses (bronchoalveolar fluid vs interstitial disease). Gene expression studies of lung tissues show suggestive of type II alveolar epithelial cell injury or proliferation, endothelial cell injury, and coagulation in patients with acute exacerbation of IPF that is distinct from patients with acute lung injury.93 It is possible there are no major associations with conventional respiratory viruses with IPF. However, there have been reports of the presence of certain human herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in patients with IPF and animal models of fibrosis.94 Another study showed patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation were found to be positive for EBV (11/12) and human herpesvirus (HHV)-6B (10/12) compared with control lung samples that were positive for HHV-6B (3/10) and negative for EBV (0/10).95 They suggest that herpesviruses could contribute to the lung epithelial injury that initiates profibrotic responses in IPF. Whether or not IPF acute exacerbation represents reactivation of latent herpesviruses remains unknown and requires further explorations.",

Epidemiologic studies and basic research suggest that sarcoidosis represents an immune response to an exogenous agent in a genetically susceptible individual. A definitive exogenous agent responsible for sarcoidosis remains elusive. Some investigators have speculated that a transmissible or infectious agent may cause sarcoidosis.97 There has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest a link between infection and sarcoidosis, especially with regard to Mycobacteria and Propionibacteria. The thought is that maybe persistent antigenic stimulation from microbial agents at sites of inflammation results in sarcoidosis. However, to date, identifying the etiology of sarcoidosis has remained elusive. A variety of viruses have been proposed as etiologic agents or triggers for sarcoidosis; yet, this association has been difficult to define. The viruses associated with sarcoidosis based on serology include EBV, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HHV-6 and HHV-8, and coxsackie virus.96, 98 Data supporting an increased frequency of these viral respiratory infections in sarcoidosis have been lacking.",

There is much less compelling evidence for the association of viruses with IPF or sarcoidosis.
