            "text": "The cyclophilins (EC: 5.2.1.8) represent a family of highly conserved peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) enzymes those are expressed by most living organisms, and some giant viruses [1\u20135]. These proteins control protein folding by catalyzing the trans to cis isomerization of the peptidyl bonds those precede proline residues. These enzymes also influence numerous other cellular processes including protein trafficking, transcription, cell differentiation, apoptosis, protein secretion, T-cell activation, and signal transduction. In addition, these folding catalysts play critical roles in developing cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, viral infections, cancer, diabetes, sepsis, asthma, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and microbial infections [2, 3, 6\u201311]. The catalytic activities of the cyclophilins are typically inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclic peptide harboring eleven amino acid residues [1]. A ternary complex, formed by the association of CsA-cyclophilin complex with calcineurin, prevents the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-AT that, in turn, blocks the expression of cytokines from T-lymphocytes [12\u201314]. The reduction of T-cell activity by CsA has made it extremely useful in clinics, particularly for preventing graft rejection after organ and bone marrow transplantation [2]. However, the severe side effects of CsA have restricted its use [15] and promoted to develop many CsA analogs with no immunosuppressive activity [2, 10, 11, 16\u201318]. Some of these CsA analogs though yielded promising results have not been approved yet.",

Usually, one domain in the multidomain cyclophilins, like the single domain cyclophilins, is employed for both the catalysis of prolyl isomerization and CsA binding, whereas their rest domains are involved in the variety of functions including controlling of PPIase activity [19]. The PPIase domains of cyclophilins have a \u03b2-barrel conformation that is constituted with eight anti-parallel \u03b2-strands, two-three \u03b1-helices, and several connecting loops [1, 20, 21]. Their hydrophobic active sites are made using the side-chains of amino acid residues from most of the \u03b2-strands and loops. While thirteen residues are required for binding CsA [1, 20\u2013 22], eleven residues in the active site are involved in the binding of a tetrapeptide substrate [1, 23]. Of the residues, nine residues are used by both CsA and substrate for binding.",

            "text": "The linear polypeptide chains synthesized in the living cells become functional only when these molecules are folded into proper three-dimensional forms. To experimentally understand the mechanism of protein folding, native/denatured forms of proteins are gradually unfolded/refolded followed by monitoring their conformational changes using a suitable probe [24, 25]. The unfolding/refolding study usually indicates whether the folding of a protein occurs by a two-state or by a multi-state mechanism through the generation of no or multiple intermediates. Additionally, unfolding studies intimate about the stability of proteins in the presence of ligands or mutations [26\u201332]. Furthermore, such studies have greatly influenced many biotechnological fields including drug discovery [33\u201339]. Cyclophilins belonging to the same class or different class harbor a structurally conserved PPIase domain [1\u20133, 19]. However, these enzymes are not identical at the amino acid sequence level, indicating that their unfolding mechanism may be different. Thus far, unfolding mechanisms of only a few cyclophilins [40\u201343] were studied though these proteins were considered as the promising drug targets [2, 3, 10, 11].",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogenic bacterium, harbors a gene that encodes a putative cyclophilin (SaCyp) of 197 amino acid residues [42]. A gene chip-based investigation has demonstrated that SaCyp (UniProt Code: A0A0H3K705) is not induced by stress [44]. Conversely, a gene silencing-based study has indicated that this protein is not required for the growth of S. aureus [45]. On the other hand, computational analyses have revealed that SaCyp shares significant sequence homology with the PPIase domains of cyclophilins from different living organisms including human [42, 46]. The putative PPIase domain formed by nearly the entire region of SaCyp also carries a CsA binding site [42]. Various experimental studies have collectively suggested that SaCyp carries PPIase activity, exits as a monomer, binds CsA, and is involved in the S. aureus-mediated hemolysis and virulence [42, 46]. Specifically, nuclease, an S. aureus-encoded virulence factor seems to be folded by SaCyp [46]. Interestingly, a point mutation in SaCyp that abolished its PPIase activity partly refolded a denatured nuclease [47]. An S. aureus mutant carrying the above mutation also exhibited pathogenicity in mouse and possessed hemolytic activity [47]. Jointly, SaCyp could be exploited in developing and screening the novel antistaphylococcal agents capable of preventing the infections caused by the multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains, a global concern today [48\u201350]. As the gene expressing SaCyp is not essential [45, 47], S. aureus will less likely develop resistance to the newly designed or screened SaCyp inhibitors. Additionally, new CsA analogs, discovered using the structural or unfolding data of SaCyp, may also be helpful for treating other diseases. Recently, a study has indicated that the drug-bound or drug-unbound form of SaCyp unfolds via the generation of one intermediate in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnCl) [42]. In addition, there was a significant stabilization of SaCyp in the presence of CsA [42]. Proteins are sometimes denatured by a different pathway in the presence of different unfolding agent [51\u201354]. Thus far, the unfolding mechanism and stability of SaCyp have not been verified using other denaturants. The structural and functional properties of GdnCl-made SaCyp/SaCyp-CsA intermediate are also currently not known with certainty. Moreover, the predicted single domain structure of SaCyp [42] has not been confirmed by any biochemical study. Herein, we have studied the domain structure and urea-induced unfolding of a recombinant S. aureus Cyp (rCyP) [42] using various probes. Our limited proteolysis data indicate that rCyp is a single-domain protein with a flexible tail at its C-terminal end. The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of both rCyp and rCyp-CsA occurred via the synthesis of at least one stable intermediate. Interestingly, each intermediate has a native protein-like structure. Of the intermediates, rCyp intermediate has nearly full CsA binding activity.",

            "text": "A modeling study previously indicated that the cyclophilin, encoded by S. aureus, could be a single domain protein [42]. To confirm this proposition, we have individually performed limited proteolysis [51, 57\u201359, 61] of rCyp with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and proteinase K. Each of these enzymes is computationally determined to have higher than ten cleavage sites, which are distributed along the entire sequence of rCyp (Fig 1A). This protein will mostly remain insensitive to the above enzymes if it is really composed of only one domain. We have noted the generation of primarily one proteolytic fragment from rCyp at the initial stage of its cleavage with proteinase K (Fig 1B). One major fragment was also made at the early period of digestion of rCyp with trypsin (Fig 1C) or chymotrypsin (Fig 1D). The proteinase K-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-generated fragments are designated as fragment I, fragment II and fragment III, respectively. All of the fragments remained stable during the entire period of digestion. The intensities of the fragments were gradually increased with the increase of time of digestion. Their molecular masses are about ~2\u20133 kDa less than that of rCyp, indicating that its digestion occurred differently by a different enzyme. While fragment I seemed to be produced by the cleavage at one or both ends of rCyp, fragment II was possibly originated due to the removal of any one of its end. On the other hand, fragment III might have been generated in an unconventional way. The peptide bonds formed by Phe, Tyr, and Trp residues are usually cleaved by chymotrypsin with high efficiency, whereas those are made with Leu, Met, and His residues are digested by this enzyme with less efficiency (web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter). All of the higher sensitive cut sites of chymotrypsin are located in the rCyp region that is made by its residues 52 to 183 (Fig 1A). As the removal of last 36 residues or the first 52 residues of rCyp by chymotrypsin would contribute to the mass loss of 4 kDa or more, fragment III might have been generated due to the cleavage at the less chymotrypsin-sensitive bonds at its ends. Our Western blot analyses show no interaction between the proteolytic fragments and anti-his antibody (Fig 1E\u20131G), indicating the loss of polyhistidine tag from the N-terminal end of rCyp in the presence of the above enzymes.",

The m/z spectrum shows that there was a generation of two major peaks from rCyp digested with proteinase K (S1A Fig). Conversely, trypsin (S1B Fig)- or chymotrypsin (S1C Fig)-digested rCyp resulted in largely one major peak as expected. As the two peaks obtained from the proteinase K-digested rCyp were fused with each other, the fragment I might be composed of two proteolytic fragments (designated as Ia and Ib) having a little difference in molecular mass. The single major peak originated from the trypsin-digested rCyp most possibly corresponds to fragment II. Similarly, the peak yielded from the chymotrypsin-cleaved rCyp might be due to fragment III. The molecular masses of the above rCyp fragments, calculated using the m/z spectral data (S1 Fig), were found to vary from 21493.63 to 22050.73 Da (Table 1). Using the predicted cut site data of rCyp (Fig 1A), different proteolytic fragments were generated followed by the determination of their masses using a computational tool (web.expasy.org/protparam). The rCyp fragments whose theoretical masses (Table 1) nearly matched with the experimental masses of fragments Ia, Ib, II, and III are composed of the amino acid residues Ser 23 to Val 218, Ser 23 to Glu 219, Gly 18 to Glu 220, and Ala 22 to Glu 220, respectively (Fig 1A). Thus, five peptide bonds, made by the rCyp residues Arg 17 and Gly 18, Met 21 and Ala 22, Ala 22 and Ser 23, Val 218 and Glu 219, and Glu 219 and Glu 220, showed sensitivity to the proteolytic enzymes employed in the investigation. Of the susceptible peptide bonds, three bonds are in the polyhistidine tag carrying region of rCyp and the rest bonds are in the extreme C-terminal end of this enzyme (Fig 1A). Collectively, both ends of rCyp might be exposed to its surface.",

Previously, both rCyp and rCyp-CsA in the presence of GdnCl were unfolded via the production of one intermediate [42]. To check whether the urea-induced unfolding of these proteins would follow the similar pathway, their far-UV CD, intrinsic Trp fluorescence, and ANS fluorescence spectra were separately recorded in the presence of 0 to 7/8 M urea (S2 Fig) A monophasic curve is obtained for rCyp when the ellipticity values at 222 nm were plotted against the matching urea concentrations. Conversely, such a curve generated for rCyp-CsA was biphasic in nature (Fig 2A). A monophasic curve for rCyp and a biphasic curve for rCyp-CsA were also obtained when we plotted their Trp fluorescence intensity (Fig 2B) or the associated \u03bbmax (Fig 2C) values against the related urea concentrations. The \u03bbmax values of both proteins were shifted to 350 nm when there was a saturation of fluorescence intensity. All of the biphasic curves show the transitions at ~1.5/2\u20132.75/3 M and ~5/5.5\u20137/7.5 M urea, respectively. Unlike the curves obtained using the CD and Trp fluorescence data, the curves, prepared using the ANS fluorescence intensity values of rCyp and rCyp-CsA, look very similar and possibly carry two transitions (Fig 2D).",

            "text": "To accurately determine the mechanism of the urea-induced unfolding of rCyp and rCyp-CsA, all of the unfolding curves were examined using different models [24, 25, 57]. Each rCyp-specific curve, generated using CD or Trp fluorescence signals, exhibited the best fitting with a two-state model [24]. The Cm values, obtained from the fitted CD (Fig 2A), Trp fluorescence intensity (Fig 2B) and the \u03bbmax (Fig 2C) data of rCyp, are 3.82\u00b10.04 M, 2.91 \u00b1 0.07 M, and 3.30\u00b10.06 M urea, respectively. Conversely, the rCyp-specific curve, produced using ANS fluorescence signals, fit best to the three-state model [25] with the resulted Cm1 and Cm2 values of ~1.18 M and ~3.68 M urea (Table 2), respectively. Thus, the ANS fluorescence data suggest the formation of a rCyp intermediate at ~3 M urea (Fig 5). Two additional pieces of evidence have supported the above proposal. The fractions of denatured rCyp molecules, estimated from both the CD (Fig 2A) and Trp fluorescence data (Fig 2B), were plotted against 0\u20137 M urea and the resulted curves did not coincide with each other (S3A Fig). The non-overlapping of such curves indicates the formation of unfolding intermediate [25]. Secondly, the phase diagram [29, 63], used to know about the formation of the hidden unfolding intermediate of proteins, was developed by plotting the Trp fluorescence intensities of rCyp at 320 nm against its fluorescence intensities at 365 nm (S3B Fig). The yielded non-linear plot again suggests the formation of rCyp intermediate(s) at 0\u20137 M urea.",

The data show that the Cm1 and Cm2 values of rCyp-CsA are significantly higher than those of rCyp (all p values <0.05). The difference of free energy change between rCyp and rCyp-CsA (i.e. \u0394\u0394G1 or \u0394\u0394G2) is more than ~0.5 kcal M-1 (Table 2). The thermodynamic parameters, determined by fitting the TUGE data (Fig 3) with the two-state equation [24], are also presented in Table 2. The yielded \u0394GW and Cm values of rCyp-CsA were noted to be significantly higher than those of rCyp (all p values \u2248 0.03).

Our limited proteolysis (Fig 1) and the subsequent analyses (Table 1) have revealed that two rCyp ends carrying residues 1 to 22 and 218 to 220 are only susceptible to three proteolytic enzymes employed in the study. The rCyp region having residues 23 to 218 carries most of the cleavage sites of these enzymes (Fig 1A). The absence of digestion in the internal rCyp region indicates the formation of a domain by the residues 23 to 218. The residue 23 in rCyp corresponds to the C-terminal end residue of its polyhistidine tag, whereas its residue 218, equivalent to the residue 195 of SaCyp (Fig1A), is the C-terminal end residue of the domain. Thus, the single domain structure of SaCyp proposed before on the basis of computational studies [42] was confirmed by our proteolysis results. However, such single domain structure is not unprecedented as the cyclophilins those have masses nearly similar to that of SaCyp are also shown to carry single domain capable of binding both the substrate and inhibitor [2, 3, 11, 19].",

CPR3, encoded by yeast, was unfolded by means of the creation of two structurally different intermediates in the presence of urea [43]. Of the CPR3 intermediates, the intermediate formed at relatively less urea concentration has the characteristics of a molten globule [71]. Like rCyp, LdCyp, synthesized by Leishmania donovani [41], was unfolded by a three-state mechanism in the presence of GdnCl. The LdCyp intermediate, like the above CRP3 intermediate, also has the properties of a molten globule [71]. On the other hand, the urea-induced unfolding of PpiA (a mycobacterial cyclophilin) or its drug-bound form occurred via the formation of an intermediate [40]. Currently, little is known about the biological activities of CPR3, LdCyp, and PpiA intermediates. Conversely, our studies for the first time have indicated that the drug binding activities of the urea-made rCyp intermediate and native rCyp are nearly similar (Fig 6C).

            "text": "The complete retention of drug binding activity in the rCyp intermediate (Fig 6C) implies no significant alteration of the three-dimensional structure of the cyclosporin A binding site in the presence of 3 M urea. Our previous studies showed that the putative cyclosporin A binding site in SaCyp is primarily located in the regions harboring residues ~Arg 59 to Phe 116 and ~Trp 152 to His 157 [42]. Therefore, the structural change noted in rCyp intermediate (Fig 2) possibly have occurred at regions carrying residues ~Ala 2 to His 58, ~Ile 117 to Pro 151, and ~Thr 158 to Glu 197. Besides Trp 152, SaCyp carries another Trp residue at position 136 [42]. An analysis of the model SaCyp structure [42] with Swiss PDB Viewer (spdv.vital-it.ch) indicates that the former Trp residue is relatively more exposed on the surface of SaCyp. As Trp 152 is conserved and indispensable for binding CsA [1], there might be little change of the structure around this residue in the rCyp intermediate. The altered Trp fluorescence intensity and emission maxima of the rCyp intermediate (Fig 2B and 2C), therefore, suggests a structural change around Trp 136. Additional studies are needed to prove the urea-induced structural alteration around Trp 136 with certainty.",

As these analogs did not yield encouraging results in the clinical trials [10, 11], screening or synthesis of additional CsA analogs should be continued on a priority basis. An inhibitor can be easily screened against a drug target if the binding of the former increases the midpoint of unfolding transition (or the stability) of the latter [33\u201339]. Several chemical denaturation-based assay systems were reported to screen the drug molecules against various drug targets including PPIase enzymes [28, 34, 35, 37, 39]. Our present (Table 2) and previous [42] unfolding results demonstrated the significant increment of the stability of rCyp in the presence of CsA. The urea-induced unfolding of a mycobacterial cyclophilin also reported its stabilization by CsA [40]. Collectively, an unfolding-based assay system could be developed using SaCyp or rCyp for screening new CsA analogs in the future.",

The rCyp intermediate has the native-protein like structure and also shows little loss of CsA binding activity. The unfolding of the CsA-bound rCyp also similarly occurred in the presence of urea.
