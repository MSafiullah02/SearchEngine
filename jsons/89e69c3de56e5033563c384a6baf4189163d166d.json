The aim of the study was to assess the reasons for the purchase of those medications in Poland. We examined 413 adults, aged 18 and over (70.5 % of them were women) using a questionnaire. The findings demonstrate that oral synthetic products were used by 76 % of respondents, while herbal products by 30 %. Synthetic products were used mainly by educated people under 65 years of age, students, and the employed. Herbal products were used mainly by older people. In conclusion, synthetic products against common cold are perceived as more effective. Such medications are used by people who 21 probably would like to recover and return to professional activity as quickly as possible. As they generally use more medications, they are at increased risk of adverse effects resulting from drug interactions, and they should be a target group for health education programs.",

            "text": "Common colds, which means viral upper respiratory tract infections, are generally mild diseases caused mainly by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and less often other viruses (human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses and metapneumovirus) (Johnston and Holgate 1996) . Respiratory tract infections are particularly common among children. It is estimated that two to five colds might occur in adults, while children were prone to have seven to ten colds per year (Eccles 2005) . The diagnosis of a common cold is easy and based on clinical symptoms, so that the majority of patients are usually self-diagnosed (Raal et al. 2013) . Most upper respiratory tract infections are self-limiting and pose only a small risk of complications. The recommended management, therefore, typically involves self-care and relief of symptoms. The medications aim at bringing the ameliorating effects usually are anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drugs. Most of them are over-the-counter remedies, which are widely available (Ballengee and Turner 2014; ACPM 2011; Eccles 2006 ). The term 'over-the-counter' (OTC) means that the doctor's prescription is unneeded and it is possible to buy them anywhere, e.g., in a pharmacy, supermarket, at gas stations, or over the internet. To be registered as an OTC product, a drug must be safe in use for a predefined time (usually 3-5 days) in a mild clinical condition which can be self-diagnosed, e.g. common cold, gastrointestinal disorders, or pain (Wo\u017aniak-Holecka et al. 2012 ). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and many other health care institutions have considered these drugs as safe and effective in the treatment of many common conditions (FDA 2014) . The role of OTC medications in the healthcare system is rapidly increasing and such medications become even a more important group for therapy of the most common diseases worldwide (Ballengee and Turner 2014; Eccles 2006) . It has been estimated that as many as 35 % of adults in the US use OTC products regularly (ACPM 2011). The non-pharmacy sales depend greatly on the existing legislation. The most recent list of substances admitted to trading outside pharmacies has been published in Poland in October 2010, and the list is trimmed compared with the previous ones. The use of OTC medications can bring many advantages, e.g., an easy and immediate access to therapy and less time-consuming visits to doctors. People become more responsible to care for their medical condition. The benefits also include a reduction of costs and a better organization of the entire health care system (ACPM 2011). OTC drugs usually have a higher therapeutic index than the prescribed ones and as a consequence they are less likely to cause side effects. However, it should be noticed that the use of OTC drugs could be potentially dangerous for health when the self-diagnosis is wrong or when drug interactions arise (ACPM 2011; WHO 2002) . OTC products may also mask serious symptoms. The wide availability of the OTC medications and their intensive marketing promote an excessive use seen in some groups of people (e.g. adolescents and students -medical students particularly), lead to their misuse and addiction in some cases (Ford 2009 ). The OTC product market and usage pattern are dictated by profitorientated pharmaceutical companies, which leads to a situation in which consumers have unlimited access to a wide variety of pharmaceuticals. For these reasons, the use of OTC products must be subject to strict controls. The FDA supervises the drugs introduced to the market in the U.S. and the Compliance Policy Guide has removed a lot of medications from the market due to their unproven safety and efficacy (Fashner et al. 2012) . It also should be emphasized that in some age groups of patients, OTC drugs are not recommended or even not allowed. For instance, FDA (2014) recommends the children under 2 years of age not be given any cold medications, while the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP 1997) recommends to avoid such drugs up to 6 years of age. The role of doctors is to warn patients against excessive and reckless use of OTC drugs and to promote the awareness of benefits and untoward consequences of their overuse (Fashner et al. 2012 ).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this study has been the largest survey of consumers concerning the intake of OTC medications in Poland in recent years. Data on the self-medication in upper respiratory tract infections, including common colds, in Poland are limited and usually confined to aggregated commercial market data (EAS 2007) . The present study demonstrates that selfmedication practices involving OTC and herbal products were widespread in the surveyed sample of the Polish population; the finding which has not yet been reported in the European surveys and reviews focused on factors that drive customers' behavior (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2014; Bishop and Lewith 2010) . Common cold and flu are predominantly self-diagnosed and self-treated with OTC medicines and herbal products (Mathens and Bellanger 2010; Eccles 2005) . In the US, where data on the use of dietary supplements, including herbal supplements, have been collected more routinely, such supplements are used by about 18-19 % of the population (Wu et al. 2011 ), but available data range from 12 % in the Slone survey (Kaufman et al. (2002) ) to 42 % in another national survey (Timbo et al. 2006) . In a recent study conducted in Estonia, 67 % of respondents have had selftreated common cold and flu, using homemade remedies and medicinal plants followed by the combined use of herbal products and OTC medicines (Raal et al. 2013 ). These differences in the prevalence of OTC medicines across studies have been explained by the selection bias and differences in survey methodologies as well as by possible variations in health beliefs and health behavior of the different populations (Vargas-Murga et al. 2011; Schaffer et al. 2003) . Likewise, we attribute higher figures obtained in the present study to the possible population bias. The majority of our subjects were frequent customers of pharmacies, which may not hold true for the general population.",

Age and gender have been significant determinants of the consumption of OTC products and dietary supplements in general. Previous studies have shown a higher consumption among women than men (Menniti-Ippolito et al. 2002; National Center for Health Statistics 2002; Schaffer et al. 2003; Messerer et al. 2001; Nilsson et al. 2001; Nielsen et al. 2005) and also among old than young adults (Foote et al. 2003; Kelly et al. 2005; Bailey et al. 2013 ). In the present study we found a similar pattern of consumption; women bought more OTC products than men, and people >65 years of age more than younger adults. Likewise, people with higher education and being professionally active as well as students used OTC products more often than others. The influence of older age, as compared with the age of less than 35 years, on OTC consumption pattern was particularly visible concerning the use of herbal teas. This finding is consistent with the results of a survey in Estonia, where the general consumption of medicinal plants increased with age (Raal et al. 2013) . Older people have more time and usually suffer from chronic diseases, while younger people look for fast treatment options and prefer synthetic OTC medicines (Raal et al. 2013) .",
