The massive influx of patients requiring in-hospital management, some requiring intensive care with respiratory assistance, has congested the working load while threatening the safety of health care for patients without COVID-19. Consequently, the goal of management of these patients is double: a) delay the management of patients who are not absolute emergencies, in order to free-up bed space in the hospitals as well as the health care personnel needed to care for these patients and b) avoid the loss of chance for these patients in this setting. Attesting to this conundrum are the combined studies of the gastrointestinal surgical community, who have elaborated recommendations for the management of gastro-intestinal cancer during this troubled period [2] . While efforts to defer elective surgery seem feasible, the problem is much more difficult for surgical emergencies.",

In a report presented at the French Society for Gastro-Intestinal Surgery (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Chirurgie Digestive (SFCD)) meeting in November 2019 (not yet published), surgical appendectomy was recommended in preference to medical treatment by antibiotics alone for the management of non-complicated acute appendicitis, mainly because the risk of recurrent appendicitis was found to range from 16% to 40% at one year after initial treatment [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, the exceptional situation related to COVID-19 has led us to reconsider medical treatment alone for this particularly prevalent disease. However, this therapeutic option requires recognition of a certain number of notions in order to avoid compromising patient safety. Of note, in the current state of our knowledge, there are no arguments indicating that patients with COVID-19 respond differently to antibiotic therapy and therefore, medical treatment of non-complicated acute appendicitis could be an option in patients with or suspected to have the disease.",

However, initial results of antibiotic therapy for other indications in this subset of patients has not shown any decrease in antibiotic efficacy related to the viral disease. Avoidance of surgery in these patients is important because it reduces the risk of exposing the operating room staff, particularly in case of inadvertent release of pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy [2] . Moreover, post-operative mortality in COVID-19 positive patients seems to be higher than expected, even for elective surgery where morbidity is usually low [12] . This is another reason why a non-surgical alternative is so important in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Several case series have described successful non-operative treatment in the pregnant woman [13, 14] , however, in one study on 400 pregnant women treated medically for noncomplicated appendicitis, the risk of severe sepsis, septic shock and thromboembolic disease was higher compared to pregnant women who had undergone appendectomy [15] .

            "text": "Therefore, for the reasons mentioned above, imaging is indispensable to confirm the diagnosis when acute appendicitis is suspected. Of eight prospective studies that assessed antibiotic therapy alone for non-complicated appendicitis, only two [5, 11] did not rely on imaging for diagnostic confirmation. Imaging can rely on sonography alone [4] , CT scanner alone [8, 10] , or, one or the other [6, 7, 9] . The initial rate of failure of medical treatment alone varied little, suggesting that the diagnostic efficacy of CT and sonography are similar when the type of investigation is well adapted to the patient ( Table 1) . Sonography (US) avoids radiation exposure, is less expensive than CT, and avoids tying up the CT scanner, which is needed to manage other COVID patients. Conversely, The limitations of US include unreliable visualization of the appendix in 35-52.9% of cases [26] , reduced performance in women or obese patients [27] and, high operator-dependency [26] . When US is performed under good conditions and the appendix is correctly identified, performance [28] approaches that of standard or low-dose CT scan [29] . In conclusion, US represents an option to relieve restricted availability of the CT scanner in the radiology department when appendicitis is suspected, and the result, while not equivocal, could be sufficient to decide whether the patient can be treated with antibiotics or not. However, although US frees some space in the CT department, it still requires a trained radiologist and eventually, if the information provided is not sufficient, a CT scan will still be needed. In one meta-analysis on 2665 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of abdominal MRI for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was both 96% [30] . This imaging modality is therefore another possible choice, but from the management strategy viewpoint in the midst of the COVID crisis, MRI takes time, is expensive and availability is limited, and therefore is not a logistical solution.",

Of note, no one study has compared the efficacy of the various antibiotic therapy regimens. The choice of the best antibiotic therapy is difficult. It seems pertinent to target the bacteria that are present in the appendicular lumen, essentially E. Coli, and Bactero\u00efdes or Streptococcus strains [32] . In reality, the modifications of the appendicular microbiota are much more complex and are not limited to a small list of a few bacteria. One study dedicated to appendicular microbiota highlighted complex modifications in bacterial phyla that prevail during appendicitis with notably a high individual variability [33] . Moreover, the resistance to antibiotic therapy differs somewhat between noncomplicated and complicated appendicitis [34] . Parallelly, modifications of the submucosal bacterial infiltration have been reported during appendicitis. Fusobacterium nucleatum appears to be the main bacteria found in the submucosa of patients with acute appendicitis and bacterial infiltration increases with the severity of appendicitis [35] .",

[11] proposed initiating therapy with ertapenem. This choice is based on the emergence of enterobacteria that produce wide-spectrum beta-lactamases resistant to amoxicillin and third generation cephalosporins [36] . The reported efficacy of this type of antibiotic therapy is not superior to that of other antibiotic therapy protocols ( Table 1) , but exposes the patient to a selection of bacteria that are resistant to ertapenem [37] . Likewise, one study found that the rate of early failure in patients treated by Piperacillin + Tazobactam [11] was not reduced, while, similar to ertapenem, this antibiotic therapy exposes the patient to an important risk of selection of resistant bacteria.",

Moreover, this avoids any contact between the patient and other potentially contaminated patients in the recovery room. Conversely, this strategy does not reduce the number of beds if medical management is started in hospital. In the study by Vons et al. [8] that allowed patient discharge much earlier than the other trials, the duration of hospital stay in the group undergoing medical treatment alone was not statistically significantly shorter than that of patients undergoing appendectomy (3.96 days vs. 3.04 days, respectively, p=0.08), although it did show that tendency. As ambulatory appendectomy has been shown to be feasible and safe in selected patients [40] [41] [42] , it might be possible to reduce the duration of bed occupancy by proposing ambulatory appendectomy rather than management by antibiotic therapy alone.",

Although this option has never been evaluated directly, the current emergency situation highlights the need to assess the data in the literature on this topic. In the study by Lefran\u00e7ois et al. [40] , depending on the timing of diagnosis, patients selected for ambulatory appendectomy were allowed to return home with antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) and return the next day for operation. No serious incident was reported in connection with the delay before surgery. A strict selection of these patients according to a Saint-Antoine score \u2265 4 ( Table 3) , based on the probability of successful ambulatory surgery, allows selection of those patients with low risk for complicated appendicitis [40] . The score was validated in a study from another center in 2019 [43] . For these reasons, under the current circumstances, certain patients, selected according to the Saint-Antoine score, could be treated in a completely ambulatory setting as long as they were clearly informed. As well, these patients should have the possibility of contacting the surgical unit without going through the emergency department if the course of events at home becomes unfavorable. It seems preferable that this decision be made by the same surgeon who interrogated and examined the patient to begin with, so that he/she assumes the consequences of this decision, is responsible for the information given to the patient and the management in case of any unfavorable event occurring at home.",

While laparoscopy is generally preferred under normal circumstances [49] , the Mac Burney incision should be reconsidered in this exceptional time. Effectively, the potential of aerosol-borne viruses released by laparoscopy in a COVID-19 positive patient exposes the OR personnel to the risk of contamination [2] , although there are no specific data on this topic in the literature at the present time. This leads us to propose either antibiotic therapy alone or open appendectomy via laparotomy for patients who are COVID-19 positive. It is difficult to conclude on the best approach for patients who do not present any signs of COVID-19 infection, i.e., asymptomatic carriers or those in the incubation phase. A precautionary principle would be to routinely proscribe laparoscopy during the pandemic. Routine preoperative testing for viral infection before appendectomy does not seem to be practical at present because of limited access to the tests, the delay before obtaining results which is not instantaneous, and the non-negligible risk of false negatives [50] . Chest CT scan can be helpful in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection, but again, its performance is not optimal [50] and probably not very good in asymptomatic carriers.",
