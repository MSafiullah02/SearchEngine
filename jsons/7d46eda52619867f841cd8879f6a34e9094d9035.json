            "text": "Lie et al. wisely recommend administering regional anesthesia and recovering the patient in the operating room to minimize exposure to hospital staff and other patients. While they assert that regional anesthesia is not an aerosolgenerating procedure, 1 there is recent preliminary evidence that COVID-19 may spread via small (\\ 5 lm) respiratory droplets, which can remain in the air for prolonged periods of time. These droplets are generated not only through coughing and sneezing, but also through forceful exhalation and loud speech. 2 Regional block placement, especially if challenging, may therefore result in an unnecessary potential exposure. Thus, for those patients having a planned general anesthetic where a concomitant regional technique is also going to be used, we should consider re-evaluating the current recommendations of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia that currently advises against the routine performance of peripheral nerve blocks in anesthetized adult patients. 3 Proponents of this practice believe that patient wakefulness may aid in the detection of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) or impending peripheral nerve injury. 3, 4 To put things into perspective, the relatively low incidence of long-term neurologic injury and LAST, reported to be as high as 0.04% and 0.1%, respectively, 3,4 should be contrasted with the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high mortality rate in susceptible individuals. While ultrasound guidance may not decrease the risk of nerve injury, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of LAST by 65%. 5 In addition, a neuraxial anesthetic on an awake (preferably quiet and non-coughing) patient who is wearing a surgical mask may not require continuous capnography monitoring or oxygen supplementation A ; this can be especially useful in cases of shortages of antimicrobial breathing circuit filters or in austere/ resource-poor environments. Furthermore, an awake patient may be transferred to their hospital room with minimal recovery time.",
