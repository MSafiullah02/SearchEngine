Cancer patients are vulnerable, and the balance between fear of immunosuppression, with the threat of COVID-19, and a compromised cancer outcome due to either delays in treatment or the use of suboptimal alternatives is a matter of great concern taking place daily in MDTs throughout the world. The Chinese experience to date highlights these concerns, in particular the added risk of Infection due to cancer-associated or treatment-induced therapy, as well as poorer outcomes from infection itself with higher risk of severe events. Patients who underwent chemotherapy (CT) or surgery in the prior month had a clinically severe form in 75% of cases, with an odds ratio of 5.34 (95% confidence interval 1\u00b780\u201316\u00b718; P = 0\u00b70026).1 Therefore, the risk of acquiring COVID-19, and its implications with respect to mortality in particular, is highly relevant at this time in treatment planning and informed consent.2",
