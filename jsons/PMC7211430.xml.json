Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the Coronavirus family, whose members cause a range of infectious diseases from a common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (2). At the moment, there is very limited knowledge about the various aspects of the disease including pregnancy and maternal and fetus health. Epidemic and pandemic viral infections in recent years have shown that pregnant women experience more adverse outcomes than non-pregnant ones (2). The risk of developing a viral infection, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, H1N1, and influenza-A is higher in pregnant women, and these infections can lead to undesirable medical and prenatal outcomes such as maternal mortality, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and preterm delivery. However, we know little about COVID-19 in pregnancy (3). ",

Increased heart rate, oxygen consumption, stroke volume, and decreased pulmonary capacity and functional residual capacity are the main physiological changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during pregnancy that increase the complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women compared to the non-pregnant population (2, 4). On the other hand, pregnancy is associated with immunosuppression. This situation makes pregnant women more susceptible to infectious diseases (2). Moreover, there is a possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus and creating significant infections in fetuses and neonates (2). These concerns are based on experiences gained from infections such as the Zika virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and other agents capable of transmitting vertically from mother to fetus. These viruses could threaten the health and survival of the infected mother and her fetus (4).",

These questions include: Are the symptoms of COVID-19 infection different in pregnant women compared to the general population? Are pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia at a higher risk of death? Are pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia at higher risk of obstetrics complications such as preterm labor and low birth weight? Can infection transmit vertically and cause fetal and neonatal disease? Therefore, it is crucial to find answers to these questions to gain insight and design a management protocol for pregnant women. So, this study was designed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their infants. Moreover, assessing the risk of vertical transmission and the possible mechanisms of infection transmission from mother to fetus were other aims of this review.",

Moreover, Liu et al. carried out further assessments by examining placenta tissue and vaginal mucus and did not report any infected neonates (10). Also, the findings of studies carried out by Fan et al. and Song et al. are consistent with these results (2, 13). Although in other studies, researchers did not evaluate the products of conception, by evaluating throat swabs of neonates born to these infected mothers, they reported that in all neonates, qRT-PCR was negative. Therefore, they claimed that there was no evidence of intrauterine transmission of infection. To date, none of the studies has reported neonatal infection acquired from pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Furthermore, four of ten neonates in one study showed a range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as gastric bleeding, feeding intolerance, refusing milk and bloating (8). Seven neonates had abnormalities in chest radiography at the time of admission, which were caused by infections (N=4), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) (N=2), and pneumothorax (N=1). Refractory shock was found in one of the neonates, which developed into multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). As a result, treatment started with platelet transfusion, suspended red blood cells, and plasma. However, he died nine days after birth. Another neonate received intravenous transfusion of gamma globulin, platelets, suspended red blood cells, and plasma. Up to the date of publishing the report, this infant was alive (8). Both of the two neonates reported by Fan et al. (2), showed complications after birth. One of them had lymphopenia, abdominal distension and low-grade fever three days after birth and diffuse haziness in chest radiograph four days after birth. However her response to the antibiotic was good and she was later discharged. The other neonate had lymphopenia (10.5%) and mild neonatal pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics and was also discharged from the hospital (2). Moreover, a 40-week baby developed Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid and chorioamnionitis as a result of chronic fetal distress (12). Other neonates did not show any adverse outcomes.

In the current study, the most dominant initial symptoms were fever and cough. However, there wasn\u2019t any high-grade fever. In all patients complaining of fever, the temperature was less than 39 \u00b0C. This is consistent with the results of non-pregnant patients. One meta-analysis reviewed data of 46248 infected patients with COVID-19 and reported that in the general population, the principal clinical symptoms were fever (91\u00b13, 95%CI 86-97%), cough (67\u00b17, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue (51\u00b10, 95% CI 34-68%) and dyspnea (30\u00b14, 95% CI 21-40%) (14). Similarly, previous studies focusing on SARS and MERS revealed that laboratory and clinical findings in pregnancy were similar to those reported in the general population (15). This study also found that the rate of developing severe pneumonia and the need for admission to ICU were relatively low and similar to the non-pregnant cases. Only two of the 86 pregnant women in this study developed severe pneumonia. However, there was not any report of maternal death. The limited data available on the effects of SARS and MERS in pregnancy, proposes that the complications of COVID-19 in pregnancy are lower than other coronaviruses. A review on SARS in 12 pregnancies revealed a case-fatality rate of 25%. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (N=4), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (N=3), renal failure (N=3), secondary bacterial pneumonia (N=2), and sepsis (N=2) were the main complications (15). In pregnant women infected with SARS, mechanical ventilation was three times more common than non-pregnant cases. On the other hand, in a study on 13 pregnant cases with MERS-CoV, three patients (23%) died (15).",

Samples can be obtained from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, saliva) or the lower respiratory tract (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage) as well as urine and stool. If required, samples should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis. COVID-19 can be ruled out if two consecutive samples from the respiratory tract with at least 24 hours interval are negative. Using serology as a diagnostic procedure is recommended only when RT-PCR is not available (16). However, Li et al. suggested that chest CT scans in the third trimester in pregnant women could be an effective test to assess COVID-19 pneumonia given the strained time and availability of PCR tests, especially in regions struggling with ongoing epidemics (9).",

The rate of poor fetal outcomes, abortion, and miscarriage was significant. Also, the outcomes of pregnant patients were more undesirable than the general population (2). In a study, 10 out of 11 pregnant mothers infected with SARS-CoV, revealed adverse outcomes. Their neonates also showed complications such as admission to neonatal ICU (NICU) (N=6, 55%) and death (N=3, 27%). Moreover, two neonates were born prematurely due to severe maternal respiratory failure. Outcomes of pregnancies depended on trimesters of pregnancies. Full-term healthy infant (N=1), spontaneous abortion (N=4) and elective termination of pregnancy (N=2) due to social reasons after recovery from SARS were the outcomes of seven pregnant mothers infected with SARS in the first trimester (16). Four preterm labor deliveries with gestational age after 24 weeks were also reported by studying five women (15). Similarly, results acquired from 13 pregnant patients with MERS-CoV showed two preterm labors and two fetal demises. Evidence of vertical transmission was neither detected in SARS nor in MERS (15). However, the limited sample size of pregnant patients infected by COVID-19 found that the behavior of this virus in pregnancy is different. Although the rate of preterm labor and fetal distress was significant, fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and complications have been reported due to COVID-19 infection in pregnancy (17). Until now, there is no report on the death of pregnant women in articles. There are some reasons for these differences. First of all, the number of cases in these studies is small. Secondly, all women were in their third semester of pregnancy and most of them gave birth less than seven days after the diagnosis of the disease. Hence, this short clinical manifestation-to-delivery time may be too short to affect pregnancies. ",

In cases of cesarean section, the choice of anesthesia needs careful consideration (16).

Using instrumental delivery also is preferred to cesarean section to avoid unnecessary surgical complications and maternal exhaustion (18).",

The authors attempted to examine conception products, namely samples of amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk, placenta tissue, and vaginal mucus, and assessed RT-PCR results in neonates to answer this critical question. However, neither these samples nor neonates were infected with COVID-19. The most significant point is that all samples were collected during parturition in the operating room. This can ensure that none of the samples were contaminated and also represent the real intrauterine conditions (19). These articles suggested that the possibility of vertical transmission of infection in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy is trivial. However, these results could be affected by small sample size, mode of delivery and gestational age at the time of infection (20). ",

Considering the negative results of SARS-COV-2 in samples of umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, breast milk, vaginal mucus, placenta tissue, and neonatal throat swab, there is also no evidence of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancies. It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes rises when COVID-19 onsets in the third trimester of pregnancy. Since there are no reports of pregnant patients in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy, the risk of stillbirth and abortion as a result of COVID-19 is obscure and needs to be clarified. Given the impact of similar infections (SARS and MERS) on outcomes of pregnancies in the first and second trimesters, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and neonate outcomes.
