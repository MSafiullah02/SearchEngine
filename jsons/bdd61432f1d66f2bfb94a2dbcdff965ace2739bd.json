            "text": "For a virus to establish persistence in the host, it has to exploit the host immune system such that the active T-cell responses against the virus are curbed. On the other hand, the goal of the immune system is to clear the virus, following which the immune responses need to be downregulated, by a process known as immunoregulation. There are multiple known immunoregulatory mechanisms that appear to play a role in persistent viral infections. In the recent past, IL-10 and PD-1 have been identified to be playing a significant role in the regulation of antiviral immune responses. The evidence that viruses can escape immunologic attack by taking advantage of the host's immune system is found in LCMV infection of mice and in humans persistently infected with HIV and HCV. The recent observation that the functionally inactive T-cells during chronic viral infections can be made to regain their cytokine secretion and cytolytic abilities is very encouraging. Thus, it would be likely that neutralization negative immune regulation during persistent viral infection would result in the preservation of effector T-cell responses against the virus, thereby resulting in the elimination of the persistent infection.",

Such acute responses involve a first step innate immune response (macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs] , and natural killer [NK] cells) [2], followed by the generation of adaptive immunity (T and B cells). Macrophages and DCs act as phagocytes thus eliminating the infected cells, and NK cells directly kill the infected cells. In adaptive immunity, which kicks in 3-5 days after infection, presentation of viral antigen by macrophages and/or DCs or by infected cells that present viral peptides on host MHC molecules results in the activation of T-cells.",

            "text": "Intravenous infection of adult mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-Armstrong results in an acute infection, which is resolved by virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells within 8-10 days [4] . However, unlike in acute viral immune response where antiviral CTLs are present at all times examined; in persistent infections, whether it be the effector phase or memory phase, antiviral CD8 T-cells are rarely found in adult mice or in humans infected early in life [1] . A more detailed discussion of innate and adaptive immune responses in viral infections is beyond the scope of this chapter. Some virus, for instance HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV)/ hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and LCMV in mice, escape killing by the host's immune system, either by avoidance or manipulation and establish persistent infection in the host. To establish a persistent infection, the virus has to overcome several host-dependent factors. One unique strategy that viruses employ is that instead of killing its host cell, the virus causes little to no damage so that it can escape detection by the immune system. The virus then either continues to replicate inside the cell (HIV) or it establishes latency (EBV). Viruses can alter or interfere with the processing of viral peptides by professional antigen presenting cell (APC), a requirement for activation and expansion of the T cells that normally remove infected cells. Additionally, viruses can also inhibit the differentiation of antigen-presenting conventional DCs and can infect effector T and B cells directly [1] . Some viruses also encode miRNAs to regulate their replication or latency or to manipulate or evade host immune responses [5] . During latency, miRNAs keep protein levels of viral genes to a minimum, facilitating evasion of immune surveillance [6] . Finally, viruses also exploit the host's immunoregulatory mechanisms such that the viral antigen-specific T-cells now become either anergic or are deleted and thus fail to clear the viral infection. This strategy is more detrimental to the host.",

Thus, it was interesting to note that despite prolonged periods of inactivation, the remaining CD4 and CD8 T-cells still retain the ability to recover their functional activity [29] . This suggests that, in persistent viral infections, the host's immune system can still be manipulated such that the host can reestablish immunity against the virus. Thus, functional preservation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells during viral persistence is the ultimate mode of achieving strong antiviral immunity and viral clearance.",

On the other hand, the goal of the immune system is to clear the virus, failing which the immune responses need to be downregulated so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the host tissue, by a process known as immunoregulation. The various known immunoregulatory mechanisms comprise (a) activation or induction of Tregs, (b) expression of inhibitory molecules such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on activated T-cells, and (c) production of suppressor cytokines such as TGF-b or IL-10. In the recent past, among the major immunoregulatory molecules identified so far [15, [30] [31] [32] , IL-10 [15, 32] and PD-1 [30] appear to be playing a significant role in the regulation of antiviral immune responses and are thus being actively investigated. The confounding aspect of all these different factors is that they not only regulate antiviral immune responses but they are also involved in the regulation of autoimmune responses.",

However, it appears that direct cell-contact-mediated suppression is critical for the action of Tregs. Tregs inhibit, via CTLA-4, the upregulation of CD80 and CD86 by immature DC upon antigenic stimulation and also downregulate the expression of CD80/CD86 by mature DC [79, 80] , thus indirectly affecting antiviral CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. Another plausible mechanism by which Tregs mediate their regulatory activity has been proposed; since Tregs cannot produce IL-2 and thus cannot expand in an autocrine fashion [81] , but constitutively express high levels of IL-2R (CD25), they likely deprive effector T-cells of IL-2 in the vicinity and thus provide hindrance to the activation/expansion of responder T cells [82] .",

It is now well known that TGF-b controls various aspects of the inflammatory response through the regulation of chemotaxis, activation, and survival of T cells, NK cells, and APCs and is crucial for the control of antiviral immunity (reviewed in [97] ). TGF-b also exhibits highly potent inhibitory effects on cytolytic functions, cytokine production, and proliferation of T-cells (reviewed in [98] ). Conversely, TGF-b also exhibits antiapoptotic effects [99] [100] [101] on T-cells best exemplified in the case of the effector T-cells. When cultured in the presence of TGF-b and IL-2 effector, CD4 T-cells exhibit enhanced accumulation (owing to increased proliferation and survival) and even better prolonged expansion [99] . And finally, TGF-b, produced by Tregs, can act in an autocrine fashion to induce further expansion of Tregs from which it is produced. Also, TGF-b can induce the conversion of na\u00efve CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells into CD4+CD25+ T cells by the induction of Foxp3 [102] . Thus TGF-b is extensively used to induce the expansion of Treg in in vitro cultures. Data from our laboratory as well as others have now shown that such in vitro expanded Tregs are able to adoptively confer protection in virus-induced T1D model (reviewed in [103] ).",

In a virus-induced T1D mouse model, data from our laboratory showed that on one hand TGF-b suppresses na\u00efve CD8+ T cell activation, while on the other hand it enhances the survival and function of antigenexperienced/memory CD8 T cells [104] . Most importantly, systemic administration of TGF-b was shown to protect from T1D [105] .",

It is known that by 9 days after infection with LCMV clone 13, which establishes persistent infection in adult mice, both virusspecific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells become unresponsive. Data from our laboratory showed that the use of an antibody to the IL10 receptor results in very efficient control of viral persistence, even leading to the elimination of virus. By removing IL-10 inhibitory effect, in this case on T-cell anergy, we were able to induce host resistance such that the host could now resolve persistent LCMV infection [15] . This was followed by further proof that such IL-10 acts on effector T-cells [32] . When IL-10 was blocked with antibody to IL-10 receptors, T-cell numbers increase sufficiently to clear virus from blood and tissues; these T-cells that were anergized because of the persistent virus infection now regained their ability to produced proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-a, IFN-g and thus were able to reacquire their normal effector T-cell functions [32] .",

The major role players responsible for the immunosuppression that happens during persistent infections have been identified as PD-1/PD-L1 and IL-10, with TGF-b and CTLA-4 also playing a role to some extent (Fig. 1) . The recent observation that the functionally inactive T-cells during chronic viral infections can be made to regain their cytokine secretion and cytolytic abilities by neutralizing IL-10 is very encouraging [32] . More importantly, when IL-10 [111] or PD-L1 [84] was first neutralized, therapeutic vaccination against ongoing persistent LCMV infection was highly effective. Further, IL-10R blockade resulted in the ability of an otherwise ineffective DNA vaccination to be successful such that the DNA vaccination elicited a fourfold increase in the number of functional CD8 T cells [111] . Thus, it would be likely that neutralization of either IL-10 or PD-1/PD-L1 (depending on the virus) during the persistent viral infection would result in the preservation of effector T-cell responses against the virus thereby resulting in the elimination of the persistent infection. Fig. 1 . Immune regulation during persistent viral infection. In an acute infection (left), when a virus infects a normal cell, it is phagocytosed by antigen presenting cell (APC) (dendritic cell [DC] or MF). The APCs efficiently present the viral antigens to CD4 and CD8 cells, which either release proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g) or upregulate perforin, which kills the infected cells, ultimately leading to the elimination of the virus. However, in persistent infection (right), due to a number of reasons, including miRNAs and molecular mimicry, viruses evade immune recognition. Thus, the CD4 and CD8 cells are not sufficiently activated and the virus avoids immune-mediated elimination. On the other hand, APCs (MF and DCs), upon TLR2 activation, upregulate IL-10; IL-10 exhibits significant immunosuppressive effects leading to the inactivation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Further, activated T-cells also upregulate CTLA-4 that prevents costimulation, thereby leading to inactivation. And, finally, virus antigen-specific T-cells also upregulate PD-1 which, upon engagement with its ligand PD-L1, signals the death of that T-cell. These events, help to avoid immune response mediated host tissue damage but at the cost of establishing viral persistence. ",
