ADEM is more common among young adults and children and it does not show any predilection for sex or ethnicity.[2] The autoimmune etiology is being proposed in the majority of the cases that usually develops after the acute viral or bacterial infection, vaccination, or organ transplantation.[34] Though there are many bacterial and viral pathogens that leads to ADEM, the development of ADEM due to Escherichia coli (E. coli) has never been reported till now. Therefore, we report a case of para-infectious encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following urosepsis due to E. coli.",

On the second and third day of hospitalization she remained afebrile, conscious but complaining of myalgia. On the fourth day she remained conscious but developed neurological symptoms such as difficulty in walking, diminished vision, ataxia with broad-based gait. On examination she had involvement of the pyramidal tract (hypertonia, brisk reflexes in all four limbs with positive Babinski sign, and ankle clonus), cerebellum (ataxia with broad-based gait) with intact sensory system. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed decreased visual acuity of 6/18 with normal fundus. Immunological markers of inflammation such as antinuclear antibody, C-reactive protein were negative. CT brain and lumbar puncture was done immediately and the reports are shown in Table 1.",
