As expected, patients admitted to the PICU were noted to have more severe symptoms and markers of inflammatory response. However, as this cohort is from a unique, dense, urban setting, we note findings not previously observed in other hospitalized cohorts of children with COVID-19. Our patients had a higher rate of PICU admission per hospitalization (28.2%), which may be a reflection of a variety of social determinants that influence health outcomes. In previous studies (5,6,7), the ICU admission rate in children ranged from 1.7% to 16%. (3, 5, 7) In adults, the PICU admission rates range from 5% to 32%. (1,2, 12,13,14,15) Among PICU admissions, 84.6% were \u226511 years of age. The presence of comorbidities, including obesity, has been described to be one of the risk factors for critical illness with COVID-19 in children (5); however, in our small sample, age and obesity were not associated with increased likelihood of PICU admission. The overall high prevalence of obesity could partially explain our higher PICU admission rate. However, obesity may also be a marker for other risk factors associated with an increased risk of critical illness, such as poverty. (16) For example, Bronx County has the highest poverty rate of the New York City boroughs and is the least healthy county in New York state.",
