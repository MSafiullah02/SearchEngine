Cell\u2010surface carbohydrates linked to proteins or lipids are often\u2010used receptors, and they are recognized by numerous viruses to facilitate attachment and entry. The carbohydrates that are typically hijacked by viruses can be grouped into three classes: sialylated carbohydrates, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and histo\u2010blood group antigens (HBGAs). The glycosylation of a protein can also help mediating receptor recognition.",

Glycan array screening identified the oligosaccharide portion of ganglioside GM2 as a receptor for T1L.11 Structural analyses of the interaction of the GM2 glycan and T1L \u03c31 revealed that the glycan\u2010binding site lies in a small groove in the \u03c31 head domain [Fig. 3(A)]. Both terminal carbohydrate moieties of the branched tetrasaccharide contribute to \u03c31\u2010binding.11 For T3D \u03c31, no specific carbohydrate receptors have been identified thus far, but it was shown by structure\u2010function studies that this strain can bind a range of differently linked sialylated glycans within the stalk of \u03c31.

            "text": "Influenza viruses are responsible for respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, posing a significant challenge to human health and resulting in a substantial economic burden.27 Influenza viruses, which belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped ss(\u2010)RNA viruses. They are classified into three different subtypes, A\u2013C, according to their serological cross\u2010reactivity. The so called \u201cflu\u201d in humans is generally caused by Type A and B influenza viruses, with Type A being responsible for the more severe disease in humans.28 Further classification is based on two glycoproteins projecting from the viral envelope, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with H1N1 being the most prominent example in humans.29, 30 HA is the major surface glycoprotein and mediates cell attachment as well as fusion between the virus and host membranes.30 The HA prefusion homotrimer undergoes a maturation process in the presence of host proteases, resulting in disulfide\u2010linked HA1 and HA2 subunits. The HA generally consists of a head (HA1) and a stem (HA2) domain, where the head domain includes the receptor\u2010binding pocket that interacts with sialic acid receptors on the host cell to mediate entry.31 The head domain is therefore an important target of neutralizing antibodies.32 It has been shown that human influenza A viruses bind preferentially to sialylated glycans with an \u03b12,6 linkage between the terminal sialic acid and Gal. Avian viruses, on the other hand, have a preference for binding glycans with an \u03b12,3 linkage at this position. The HA head is subject to constant antigenic drift, enabling the virus to evade the host immune response. Residues that make up the receptor\u2010binding site (RBS) are more restricted in their mutational freedom because they are crucial for receptor recognition and binding. The analysis of sequences of pandemic virus strains allows to identify mutations in the RBS of HA that might be important for switching virus specificity. However, the Spanish Flu (H1N1) pandemic in 1918 was likely caused by only a pair of mutations in the RBS of an avian influenza virus, leading to a receptor switch from \u03b12,3 to \u03b12,6 linked glycans and therefore conferring human\u2010to\u2010human transmissibility.33, 34, 35 Whereas \u03b12,6 linked glycans are mainly found on human epithelial cells in the trachea and parts of the upper respiratory tract, avian viruses typically bind to \u03b12,3 linked glycans, which can be found in the intestine of birds. Mutating only one of those sites in the H1N1 RBS already confers a dual binding to both \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 linked glycans.34, 36, 37\n",

The RBSs of these spikes are most distal to the virus particle, and, therefore, are often part of or in direct proximity to the epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies. It seems intuitive that both RBSs and epitopes for antibody recognition benefit from facile accessibility of the respective region on virus particle, and also that those antibodies that prevent simultaneous receptor binding via steric hindrance are particularly efficient immunological tools. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the receptor and antibody\u2010binding sites of the four viruses discussed in this article overlap in many cases. A comparison shows that while most often no direct glycan receptor mimicry is employed by the antibodies, partial (reovirus) or complete (CoV) blocking of the glycan\u2010binding site is a common feature in virus\u2010antibody complexes. Efficient neutralization can also be observed for antibodies that bind in the immediate vicinity but do not show any overlap with the glycan\u2010binding site (norovirus). In these cases, all antibodies possess conformational epitopes, a common characteristic for neutralizing antibodies. A special case is quaternary epitopes that span multiple subunits, as is seen, for example, for the reovirus\u2010targeting 5C6 antibody. Here, the antibody\u2010binding site bridges two subunits in juxtaposition with residues responsible for glycan engagement found in a single monomer. There is no obvious requirement of such a subunit \u201cbridging\u201d for the ability of the antibody to block glycan binding, but the bridging might well prevent conformational changes of the viral attachment protein during later entry steps. This is well established for some enveloped viruses, for which antibodies have been found to stabilize a pre\u2010fusion state of the virus, thereby preventing conformational changes that are required for receptor binding or membrane fusion. Examples are the neutralizing antibody 37.7H targeting lassa virus, or the monoclonal antibody 2D22 against dengue virus.87, 88\n",

Viruses bind to individual glycan receptors with relatively low affinity (often in the mM Kd\u2010range) using only a limited number of contacts. Because the local density of some glycoconjugates, for example gangliosides, on the plasma membrane can be very high, the low individual binding energy is typically enhanced by engaging multiple receptor copies at the same time, that is, low affinity is overcome by high avidity. Antibodies, on the other hand, need to have a high affinity (at least nM Kd\u2010range) for virion surface antigens to mediate efficient neutralization. In part (and particular when compared with glycan binding) this is due to the limited number of the comparably large antibodies that can simultaneously engage a viral spike protein without clashing. Thus, while the location of glycan RBSs and antibody epitopes on viral capsids may often overlap at least in part, other aspects of glycan\u2010 and antibody\u2010virus interactions are fundamentally different (Fig. 7).",

Glycans also rely on different types of non\u2010covalent interactions to facilitate protein binding.

(A) Surface representation of the dimeric P domain with monomers colored white and gray. The epitope of Fab 5I2 (salmon) and the binding site of H\u2010type HBGA (blue) are highlighted (distance cutoff 4.5 \u00c5). The two binding sites are close to each other, but different P domain residues are involved in the interactions. The glycan moieties are shown as yellow sticks. Due to crystal contacts that prevent ligand binding, one H\u2010type HBGA is modeled based on a superposition with the other subunit. (B) Side view of the P domain. Fabs 5I2 with light and heavy chain (colored in light and dark violet, respectively) binding their antigen\u2010 this engagement would partiallly mask and sterically block glycan binding.
