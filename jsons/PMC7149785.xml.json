EBV as the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM) was discovered in 1968, when a laboratory technician working on lymphoma samples was accidentally infected with EBV and developed IM. In 1970, the virus was found to infect and immortalize B cells. EBV is a gamma-herpes-4-virus and was the first herpes virus to be completely sequenced. Several diseases are associated with EBV, including Hodgkin\u2019s and post-transplant lymphomas, oral hairy leukoplakia, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas [1], [2], [3]. However, although EBV has a population prevalence of more than 90% worldwide, only a few EBV-positive individuals suffer from diseases that are linked to EBV [1], [2], [4], [5].",

Self-assembly of the EBV capsids requires viral capsid antigen (VCA), major capsid protein (BcLF1), and major surface membrane antigens (MA) gp350/220 [10]. Viral entry into B cells is mediated by gp350, which binds to CD21 (complement receptor) and possibly other receptors and triggers endocytosis. Entry seems to additionally require binding of MHC class II by gp42 to initiate fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to release viral genetic material into the cell.",

Infection in childhood is asymptomatic or presents with subtle signs and symptoms; however, about half of the individuals infected during/after their late teens have the typical presentations of IM. EBV is usually transmitted via the oral route and replicates intensely in oropharyngeal epithelial cells. The virus enters its lytic program and infects local B cells. These B cells migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissue, but rare EBV+ B cells are also present in the bloodstream [1]. The virus has evolved strategies that render the host\u2019s immune response unable to eliminate all infected cells, enabling the virus to set up persistent infection. The virus keeps immunologically silent in persistently infected B cells by turning off most genes, and only rarely undergoes reactivation.",

A meta-analysis calculated the combined relative risk of MS after IM to be 2.3 (95% CI 1.7\u20133.0; P < 10\u22128) [17]. Besides demonstrating a potential role for EBV in MS, these findings may also suggest that the timing of primary EBV infection is important in developing MS. Those who are infected during adulthood have a higher risk of developing MS than those infected during childhood [17]. In high-risk regions for MS, the first encounter with EBV occurs during or after puberty in many individuals [18]. A large Danish study on patients with IM observed a more than twofold increased risk of MS in the IM cohort, adding to the evidence of association between IM and MS; in addition, in their study the risk of getting MS was augmented for more than 30 years after IM [19].",

A systematic review demonstrated that nearly all MS patients are infected with EBV, compared with only about 90% of healthy individuals [20]. This study reported an odds ratio of developing MS of 13.5 (95% CI 6.3\u201331.4) in EBV-positive individuals. A second systematic review confirmed the relation of EBV seropositivity and MS, and calculated an odds ratio of developing MS for seronegative individuals of 0.06 (95% CI 0.03\u20130.13) [21]. Moreover, another study confirmed that the risk of MS in EBV-negative individuals is very low; however, it considerably increases in the same individuals after infection with EBV [22]. A meta-analysis of 30 case-control studies found an association between MS and exposure to EBV by determining the anti-VCA IgG antibodies (OR=5.5; 95% CI=3.37\u20138.81; P<0.0001), anti-complex EBNA IgG (OR=5.4; 95% CI=2.94\u20139.76; P<0.0001), and anti-EBNA-1 IgG (OR=12.1; 95% CI=3.13\u201346.89; P<0.0001); however, no significant association was observed when studying anti-early antigen (EA) IgG (OR=1.3; 95% CI=0.68\u20132.35; P=0.457) or EBV DNA in serum (OR=1.8; 95% CI=0.99\u20133.36; P=0.051) [23].",

It has been shown that patients with clinical relapse, compared to patients with clinical remission, have evidence of peripheral EBV reactivation as documented by increased IgM and IgA responses to EBV EA, and detectable EBV DNA in serum [27]. Moreover, patients with anti-EBV EA antibodies have more gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [28]. Gd-enhancing lesions were also shown to be correlated with anti-EBNA1 IgG and EBNA1/VCA IgG ratio [29]. In addition, anti-EBNA1 IgG titers, but not anti-VCA IgG levels, were correlated with T2 lesion volume changes during follow-up [29]. Anti-EBNA1 IgG titers were a predictor of change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score [29]. Anti-VCA IgG levels have been positively correlated with T2 and T1 lesion volume [30], [31] and negatively correlated with atrophy parameters (gray matter fraction [GMF] and brain parenchymal fraction [BPF]) [31]. Increased anti-VCA IgG levels were associated with greater decrease in BPF after 3 years [30], [31]. In this study, anti-EBNA1 IgG was only negatively associated with GMF, and there was no association of anti-EBV EA IgG antibodies with any of the MRI parameters measured [31]. Although it has been demonstrated that EBV viral load is not associated with overall MS risk [32], [33], EBV viral load has been associated with increased disease activity [32]. It has been shown that in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), the immune response IgG against EBNA1 (but not other EBV antigens) correlates with the baseline number of T2 lesions, the number of lesions meeting the Barkhof criteria at baseline, the number of T2 lesions during follow-up, presence of new T2 lesions, and EDSS score during follow-up. In addition, increased anti-EBNA1 IgG responses predict conversion to MS based on the McDonald criteria [34]. However, no correlation was found between any EBV IgG responses and the number of Gd-enhancing lesions, although this finding was based on a small proportion of their studied patients [34]. Contrary to these studies, another study failed to show a clinical value for serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels in association with disease course and clinical disease activity [35].",

            "text": "The possibility that different strains of EBV with different biologic activity may be associated with the occurrence of MS has been put forward, but few studies have investigated whether EBV strains differ in MS patients and healthy individuals. In one of the initial studies, Munch et al. [41] used sequencing of a coding EBNA6 region and showed a similar number of repeats in all eight MS patients from a cluster cohort and the majority of random MS patients with more variety in the control cohort. They concluded that MS patients had been infected with the same subtype. Lindsey et al. [42], however, found different sequences of LMP1 both in 11 MS patients and controls. More recently, Brennan et al. found several single nucleotide polymorphisms within the EBNA1 gene and one within the BRRF2 gene, which occurred at marginally different frequencies in EBV strains isolated from MS patients compared to controls. Variations in LMP1 and the sequences of the N and C terminus of EBNA1 were also detected by Simon et al. in 66 MS patients compared to controls [43], [44]. However, a longitudinal study by Sitki-Green et al. [45] found different EBV strains in the blood and oral cavity of the same individual, indicating that different strains may also occur in the same host. Also, EBNA1 sequences spanning CD4+ T-cell epitopes varied between strains. Individuals may therefore harbor a viral quasi-species, as has been described for human immunodeficiency virus, where areas under selection pressure acquire mutations that allow escape from immune surveillance. Contrasting results on the strain specificity of EBV in MS warrant future studies.",

EBV infection of epithelial cells depends on the assistance of other viral glycoproteins (e.g., gp42), which appears to be necessary for the binding and fusion of EBV with MHC class II expressing cells [47]. LMP1 and LMP2A, which are latent EBV proteins expressed on infected B cells, mimic the activated CD40 receptor and antigen-activated B-cell receptor (BCR). They play a role in activation, proliferation, and maturation of those B cells into persistent EBV memory B cells [48]. During latent infection of B cells, EBV virion maintains an episomal form. To keep immunologically silent, EBV expresses only a limited repertoire of approximately 11 genes and downregulates surface expression of MHC class II on B cells. The virus is able to transiently switch to the lytic phase, during which approximately 80 genes are expressed encoding proteins for building virions for onward transmission. EBV infection is closely controlled by EBV-specific T cells. The percentage of EBV+ B cells in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals is between 1 and 10 latently infected B cells within 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells [49]. It is not yet known if these frequencies are similar in MS patients, which would give us an indication as to whether EBV-specific T-cell responses are altered.",

One protein of pronounced immunologic interest is EBNA1, which is a highly immunogenic protein expressed during several latency programs of the virus. It contains a long glycine\u2013alanine repeat sequence, which hinders proteosomal degradation and enables escape from CD8+ T-cell recognition [52].

[73] reported the presence of EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in the brains of 21 of 22 MS cases, and these were not present in other inflammatory neurologic diseases (primary cerebral vasculitis, viral encephalitis, mycotic meningitis, and encephalopathy of unknown origin). Eight of the MS cases were known to have ectopic B-cell follicles and rich B-cell/plasma cell infiltration, while 12 cases were less infiltrated. Forty percent to 90% of B cells and 50\u201380% of plasma cells were positive for EBER, with the highest percentage for B cells in ectopic follicles. Of note, the cases with more prominent EBER-positive cell accumulation were cases rich in B cells/plasma cell infiltrates and ectopic B-cell follicles, while less infiltrated cases had fewer and often isolated EBER-positive cells. Viral reactivation, demonstrated by EBNA2 and BFRF1 expression, was restricted to ectopic follicles and active lesions.",

            "text": "Other studies made different observations [74], [75], [76]. Willis et al. [74] examined 63 paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue specimens from 12 MS patients and from these selected 23 samples with CD20+ B-cell infiltrates. They used a wide range of techniques, including quantitative real-time PCR to detect genomic EBV and EBER1 RNA, in situ hybridization for EBER, and immunohistochemistry for EBNA2 and LMP1 [74]. In addition, 12 specimens were examined for aggregates or B-cell infiltration within the meninges; this was found to be either absent or low, but 3 of these cases did have B-cell aggregates within the brain parenchyma [74]. Real-time PCR detected low-level EBV infection in two of the cases but EBV was undetectable by in situ hybridization [74]. Peferoen et al. undertook a study screening 632 specimens from 94 MS patients, including 11 patients who died before the age of 50; in addition, they studied 12 blocks used in the Serafini study [73], [75]. Sixteen of the patients had accumulations of B-cell infiltrates, although follicle-like structures were not present in any specimen. Real-time PCR for EBV DNA and encoded RNA were negative in all tissues examined and EBER was detected only in one tissue sample by in situ hybridization, which also showed lytic cycle markers [75]. Another study screened active MS lesions with overexpression of INF-\u03b1 for the presence of EBV infection. In situ hybridization with an EBER1/2 probe showed EBV-positive cells in white matter areas of 12 MS lesions and one case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [77]. The authors proposed that EBV infection may play a more indirect role via the accumulation of EBV-infected B cells in areas of initial inflammation and stress, which may then release viral components (e.g., EBERs), which can bind to Toll-like receptor 3 and thus activate innate immune responses, contributing to sustained or increased inflammation. The most recent study using nested and non-nested real-time PCR to detect EBV-specific and cell-specific transcripts in 5 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and 15 fresh-frozen MS plaques and in single cerebrospinal fluid B lymphocytes and plasma cells did not reveal any evidence of active EBV infection [76].",
