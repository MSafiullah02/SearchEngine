In young children, a higher HR threshold (\u226540 bpm) should be used, since healthy younger children have a greater physiological orthostatic tachycardia.",

The prognosis for adolescents diagnosed with POTS is more favorable for recovery than for newly diagnosed adults [7, 8], but long-term follow-up data is lacking.

Structural problems and cardiomyopathy should be ruled out. The chest pains in POTS are almost never due to coronary artery obstruction, but are sometimes associated with electrocardiographic changes in the inferior leads, particularly when upright [10]. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) can resemble POTS, though IST patients generally have an elevated resting HR (often >100 bpm during daytime rest) [11] in contrast to the high normal heart rates seen in POTS. Whereas patients with IST may benefit from sinus node ablation, this procedure is rarely effective for the orthostatic tachycardia of POTS [8]. In addition to a cardiac consult, a neurologist may be asked to evaluate headaches or dizziness. A gastroenterology consultation may be requested if abdominal pain and nausea are present. Blood tests for serum electrolytes, a complete blood count, liver and thyroid functions, a celiac panel, and vitamin B12 are generally normal, but may be useful to rule out other conditions that cause dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Acrocyanosis is apparent in the legs and feet of approximately 50 % of patients. Gastrointestinal complaints are fairly common [12]. Sudomotor testing may be abnormal [12].

The female predominance is somewhat less in VVS than POTS (60 % vs. 85 %). Many patients with POTS do not have frank syncope, though presyncope may occur daily [9, 21]. Though VVS may also occur with pain, anxiety, and exercise, head-up tilt table testing can be used in the clinic to differentiate between POTS and VVS. In addition to a syncope outcome, the hemodynamic response to upright posture differs between the two disorders.",

Patients may complain of symptoms throughout the tilt test, but do not faint. On the other hand, in VVS, upright posture is associated with a generally delayed but abrupt decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output with bradycardia and hypotension [22], and resultant cerebral hypoperfusion leading to a sudden loss of consciousness [23] (Fig. 14.1).\n\n",

Chronic hypovolemia could contribute to a hyperadrenergic state. An expected compensatory response for hypovolemia is activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system to promote sodium and volume retention, but some POTS patients with hypovolemia have inappropriately low standing plasma renin activity and aldosterone compared with the controls [4, 30].

A 4-week trial of long-acting propranolol decreased standing HR without improving the quality of life [28]. Central sympatholytics (e.g., clonidine and methyldopa) can decrease the sympathetic nervous system tone, but need to be used carefully to avoid undesirable side effects such as drowsiness and worsening of the mental clouding [9]. Pyridostigmine can also restrain HR in POTS [46]. It inhibits acetylcholinesterase and raises parasympathetic tone by increasing the availability of acetylcholine at both the autonomic ganglia and the peripheral muscarinic receptors. It has led to long-term symptom improvement in approximately 50 % of patients with POTS, though increased gut motility may lead to discontinuation in 20 % of patients [47].",
