Many healthcare systems have responded by canceling or delaying elective surgical procedures. [1] [2] [3] [4] The downstream impacts on public health due to delays in diagnostic and therapeutic procedural care are unknown. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery identified a profound gap in the availability of safe anesthetic and surgical care in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), with an estimated 4.8 billion people lacking access to surgery at baseline. 5, 6 While high-income countries (HICs) are better suited to absorb disruptions in surgical care, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on unmet needs in LMICs could be devastating. The time course of recovery to baseline conditions following the pandemic may also be prolonged due to depletion of healthcare resources in LMICs due to their limited capacity for resource recovery.",

Our data indicate that the impacts of COVID-19 on surgical volumes have been substantial; it will be of great value for governments, global health organizations, and philanthropic organizations to have access to data providing markers of recovery of surgical capacity -or lack thereof --in LMIC. Global strategies could be put in place by large organizations (such as the WHO) to attempt mitigation.

Notably, these needs in LMIC are not trivial: 1.7 billion children lack adequate access to surgical care and an estimated 85% of children in LMIC will need surgical care by age 16. 35 Conversely, app utilization patterns may be relatively less impacted in HIC with dedicated pediatric hospitals.

A strategic global approach will decrease the morbidity and disability associated with diminished surgical capacity. Longer term, this tool can be combined with other data to assist with measurement of global surgical capacity as part of the Global Surgery 2030 initiative. As such, a near real-time dashboard has been developed (http://globalcases.info) and deployed as part of these efforts to ensure ongoing accessibility of this information.",
