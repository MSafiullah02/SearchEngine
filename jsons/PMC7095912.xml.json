            "text": "Due to population aging, the number of elderly patients presenting to trauma centers will continue to increase. Advanced age is a known risk factor for morbidity and mortality after traumatic injury [1, 2] but it is clear that other factors such as medical comorbidities also contribute strongly to outcomes [3, 4]. Recently, attention has been focused on the concept of frailty as a driver of outcomes across a wide range of disease states in the elderly, including chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and aortic valve disease [5\u20137]. The original description of frailty includes difficulty with activities of daily living, reduced speed of ambulation, subjective feelings of exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, and weakness as measured by grip strength [8]. The association of frailty with outcomes after trauma is not well characterized, perhaps in part because frailty evaluation using conventional metrics in the trauma population is not practicable. Trauma is by its nature unpredictable, and for this reason most injured patients will present without baseline measurements of frailty. Attempts to measure frailty after injury using conventional metrics may be limited by altered mental status or inability to participate in physical activity. An attractive solution to this problem is to measure a surrogate for frailty that does not rely upon active patient participation, such as radiographically determined central sarcopenia [9]. Central sarcopenia, as measured by psoas cross-sectional area, has been associated with poor outcomes after liver transplantation [10] and open repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms [11], but the impact of central sarcopenia has not yet been well characterized in the elderly trauma population.",

The PLVI has several advantages over other metrics of frailty available for use in the trauma population. Because the majority of blunt trauma patients will undergo cross-sectional imaging upon admission [14], the ability to measure PLVI is present early on for most elderly trauma patients. Since imaging occurs extremely early in the hospital course of trauma patient, admission PLVI is unlikely to be greatly affected by injuries, interventions undertaken to treat injuries, or complications developing thereafter. The admission PLVI can therefore be thought of as a baseline \u201csnapshot\u201d that represents the patient\u2019s condition at the time of injury. Because this metric is objective, does not require patient cooperation or recall, and does not require the ability to ambulate, it may be far easier to assess in patients suffering traumatic injury.",

Decreased psoas cross-sectional area has been shown to be associated with mortality after liver transplantation [10], elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [15], and esophagectomy [16]. In a cohort of patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastases, Peng et al. [17] found that a total psoas cross-sectional area of <500 mm was associated with increased risk of postoperative complications and hospital length of stay, but not mortality. Of note, our methodology differs from the above-referenced studies in that, rather than reporting the combined cross-sectional area of the psoas muscles at the L4 vertebra (or \u201ctotal psoas area\u201d, TPA), we report the ratio of psoas CSA to the L4 vertebral body CSA. The intent of this methodology is to provide a PSCA value that is normalized to individual patient body habitus, but further research will be necessary to determine the optimal measurement of central sarcopenia.",

Frailty has been associated with alterations in both the innate and adaptive immune system [18\u201320], and it is thus possible that in the presence of frailty as reflected by low PLVI, host immune responses may be compromised. Alternatively, it may be that the frailty phenotype necessitates interventions which result in increased risk of infections. For instance, patients who are unable to be mobilized from bed may be subjected to prolonged use of indwelling urinary catheters, resulting in increased risk of urinary tract infection.",

The utility of using \u201cany complication\u201d as a combined primary endpoint may be questioned, as different complications have different risk factors which may not be equally distributed between our two groups. Given our relatively small sample size and the degree of complexity that would be introduced in order to control for all of the risk factors for each individual complication, we have chosen to look at an aggregate measure instead. However, the use of morbidity as a combined endpoint may be more meaningful than rates of specific complications, as the aggregate reflects the overall baseline condition and host response to trauma. Additionally, as no specific treatments are available to protect frail patients from posttraumatic morbidity, the therapeutic benefit of a frailty index is currently very limited. However, the addition of central sarcopenia to the traditional predictors of outcome may help inform clinicians when discussing likely outcomes with family patients and their families. Future prospective studies may identify specific opportunities for improvement in this cohort. Finally, this study represents a single-institution experience with a limited number of patients, and as such may not be applicable to other centers. Specifically, the LPVI median of 0.84 from which we derive our cut-point to divide the cohort into \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d PLVI groups may not be valid in other populations. Further work with larger cohorts may help clarify this issue.",
