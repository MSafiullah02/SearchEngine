            "text": "Influenza virus infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. The influenza epidemics lead to approximately 3 to 5 million severe illness cases and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year [World Health Organization, 2014]. The ability to acquire genetic changes makes the virus to overcome the immunity from previous infections and causes yearly epidemics. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A viruses usually mutate at high frequencies [Peter et al., 2013]. As a result, the accumulation of these mutations at critical positions may lead to alter the antigenic characteristics of surface glycoproteins and the antiviral drug susceptibility. Therefore, monitoring these genetic changes of influenza virus is important for vaccine strain selection as well as identification of drug resistant strains.",

Thus, influenza vaccine is delivered annually to protect against the newly emerged influenza strains. In contrast, influenza virus circulates throughout the year with no clear seasonality in tropical regions. Moreover, little epidemiological information about influenza makes it more difficult to develop the prevention and control programs in these settings [Viboud et al., 2006]. It also has been proposed that Southeast and East Asia are regions where influenza virus A/H3N2 first evolved before spreading worldwide [Rambaut et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2008a]. Therefore, influenza virologic surveillance in these areas is necessary not only to understand the circulation of influenza viruses but also to identify the virus strains which may be included in the annual influenza vaccine composition.",

Only H3N2 virus was detected. During the following dry season (November\u2013April, coincide with the Northern Hemisphere winter season), H3N2 virus was replaced completely by H1N1pdm09. The national surveillance in Vietnam from 2006 to 2009 also revealed two peaks of seasonal influenza each year, one between June and October, and an additional minor peak during the winter time of the Northern Hemisphere [Nguyen et al., 2009, 2013]. Similar bimodal seasonal pattern of influenza activity was also reported in Thailand, Indonesia and India [Saha et al., 2014].

Due to limitation of data on influenza seasonality, the usage of influenza vaccine composition was historically based on its hemispheric location. However, the phylogenetic analysis showed that the mid\u20102010 Vietnamese H3N2 viruses grouped with viruses from other countries in the winter 2010\u20132011 and belonged to the A/Perth/10/2010 subclade (Fig. 4). This subclade was antigenically similar to vaccine strain A/Perth/16/2009 in the 2010 winter season of the Southern Hemisphere and in the 2010\u20132011 winter season of the Northern Hemisphere. The Vietnamese H3N2 viruses did not group with the vaccine strain A/Brisbane/10/2007 in 2009\u20132010. These data proved that the influenza activity in Vietnam appeared earlier than in other temperate countries in the Northern Hemisphere, and the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine usage may be too late to provide the optimal protection. These findings are consistent with the recent genetic relatedness analysis of seasonal influenza A viruses circulating in Vietnam from 2001 to 2009, which showed the high match with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains [Vuong et al., 2013]. Therefore, taken together with previous studies [Nguyen et al., 2009, 2013; Vuong et al., 2013; Saha et al., 2014], these results suggest that the Southern Hemisphere formulation and timing should be considered for use in Vietnam instead of the current Northern Hemisphere one. This is in accordance with reports from Brazil emphasizing that the adoption of seasonal influenza vaccine based on hemispheric location may not apply to tropical countries [de Mello et al., 2009]. It is also noted that the sub\u2010clade A/Perth/10/2010, to which the strains in this study belonged, emerged and spread worldwide in the winter season of 2010\u20132011 [WHO Influenza Centre London.

None of these genetic groups were considered antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain. Most of the Vietnamese strains belonged to group 7, clustered with contemporary strains from East and Southeast Asia, Australia during 2010\u20132011. They also tended to group with the North and Central American strains during the 2011\u20132012 season, suggesting that the American influenza viruses in 2011\u20132012 may have an Asian origin. Some of the amino acid substitutions were observed to locate within the major antigenic sites of the HA globular head. The S203T located within the Ca antigenic site but its buried position near the monomer\u2010monomer interface makes its role unclear [Xu et al., 2010]. The S185T located within the receptor binding site and the A197T located nearby may affect the binding of HA with its receptor [Yang et al., 2010]. The E374K located in the HA oligomerization interface may have role in membrane fusion [Russell et al., 2008b]. The mutation D222G associated with more virulent genotype was not present in these samples [Liu et al., 2010]. Recent studies have also found some important antigenic sites in the stem of HA, of which, the 2 unique mutations L420V and D436E in Vietnamese strains were located in the R1 and R2 antigenic sites [Xu et al., 2011]. However, the antigenic properties of these viruses against the vaccine strain were not examined in this study. Therefore, whether these changes affect the vaccine effectiveness needs to be elucidated. In addition, the mutation associated with oseltamivir\u2010resistant H275Y was not detected. Instead, 2 mutations D199N and S247N on the NA, which reduced the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility, were found. It should be noted that none of these patients were treated with antiviral drugs. The S247N was observed in viruses from Australia and Southeast Asia with mild reduction in oseltamivir and zanamivir susceptibility [Hurt et al., 2011]. The D199N mutation has recently detected from patients with oseltamivir resistance [Deyde et al., 2010; Ghedin et al., 2011] and exhibited to reduce susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir [Okomo\u2010Adhiambo et al., 2013]. Although the D199E/G/N mutations have respectively shown to reduce susceptibility to oseltamivir in seasonal H1N1, H5N1, and B influenza viruses, the effect of D199N mutation among H1N1pdm09 needs further investigation [Ghedin et al., 2011]. It should be noted that the viruses in this study were not cultured to avoid the generation of adaptive mutations in vitro.",

Previous research has demonstrated that this protection lasted up to 1 year after maternal influenza immunization [Zaman et al., 2008].

However, influenza vaccination for pregnant women is not recommended in Vietnam.",

Additional surveillance data are needed to confirm the seasonality and the circulation of influenza viruses. Secondly, a small number of influenza cases was identified. According to the hospital's triage process, patients with suspected influenza infections will be referred to Infectious Diseases ward for isolation and treatment. As only samples from Respiratory ward were collected, the number of influenza infections in this study may be underrepresented. However, this result was in line with the finding of recent systematic review indicating that influenza infection rate was 3% (2.2\u20134.0%) among children under 5 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory infection [Luksic et al., 2013]. Moreover, the infection rate might depend on different types of influenza virus affecting individuals of different ages, with school\u2010aged children were the most commonly affected [Olson et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2013]. Most of patients in this study were <2 years of age might explain for the low influenza infection rate. Thirdly, the data were only collected on patients seeking hospital care, thus the results may not reflect episodes of milder disease occurring simultaneously in the community. Finally, the study was lack of the antigenic assay against vaccine strains and the antiviral drug susceptibility tests. Therefore, the inferences regarding the protection of vaccine strains or of antiviral drugs are limited. However, the genetic data are also useful since amino acid mutations in some important regions usually correlate with significant antigenic changes [Smith et al., 2004].",

These data may help policy\u2010makers to inform and develop the influenza prevention and control strategies, not only in Vietnam but may also be applied throughout the region with similar influenza seasonal pattern. Continuing surveillance and characterization of circulating viruses in order to identify the emergence of genetic, antigenic, and drug\u2010sensitivity changes is critical to sustain the prevention and control policy.",
