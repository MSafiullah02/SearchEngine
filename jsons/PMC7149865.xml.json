For the purposes of this chapter, we define a \u201csignature\u201d as one or more strings of contiguous genomic DNA or RNA bases sufficient to identify a pathogenic target of interest at the desired resolution and that could be instantiated with particular detection chemistry on a particular platform. The target may be a whole organism, an individual functional mechanism (e.g., a toxin gene), or simply a nucleic acid indicative of the organism. The desired resolution will vary with each program's goals but could easily range from family to genus to species to strain to isolate. Resolution may not be taxonomically based but rather pan-mechanistic in nature: detecting virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes shared by multiple microbes. Entire industries exist around different detection chemistries and instrument platforms for identification of pathogens, and we only briefly mention a few of the techniques that have been used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to support our biosecurity-related work since 2000. Most nucleic acid-based detection chemistries involve the ability to isolate and amplify the signature target region(s), combined with a technique to detect amplification.",

These tests could take many days to complete and precise resolution of species and strains is not always possible. In contrast, protein recognition signatures composed of antibodies or synthetic high-affinity ligands offer extremely fast results but require a large quantity of the target to be present. False positives/negatives are also a problem with some protein-based techniques (home pregnancy kits use this basic approach).",

Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Knowledge of whether a particular isolate has the full virulence kit or possesses unusual antibiotic resistance properties and whether it is human transmissible is important for biodefense and public health responses. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vector(s) that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components (promoters, etc.) into the genome being modified. In the future, host range signatures might indicate that an otherwise uncharacterized pathogen was potentially capable of evading or defeating the immune system of a particular host organism.",

Focusing on biosecurity, we are interested primarily in identifying bacteria, viruses, and fungi that could potentially be used to threaten human, animal, or plant life, to disrupt our economy, or to disturb our social order. Note that there is a wide range of genome sizes involved. RNA viruses are generally small (foot and mouth disease virus is about 8 kbp, SARS coronavirus is about 30 kbp), whereas the variola virus (causative agent of smallpox) is a large DNA virus of about 200 kbp. High-threat bacterial pathogens tend to be in the 2\u20135-Mbp size range (Yersinia pestis, causative agent of plague, is about 4 Mbp while Bacillus anthracis is about 5 Mbp.) Fungi can range from 10 Mbp to over 700 Mbp. As can be imagined, the sequencing databases have many more viral genomes than bacterial and many more bacterial genomes than fungal. In comparison, the human genome is about 3 Gbp and wheat is about 16 Gbp.",

In past years, a large distinction was drawn between identification or detection signatures and forensic signatures, where forensic signatures were typically thought of as at the strain level or below (typically thought of as substrain or isolate specific). More recently the distinction has become blurred because taxonomic distinctions have become less certain and because new signature techniques provide increased resolution levels. Using current commercially available microarray technologies that allow several millions of signatures to be designed on each chip, one can interrogate the entire resolution range (genus, species, strain, and isolate) for desired pathogen targets, providing both detection and forensic resolution. Signature design today is a combination of the desired signature purpose, our current understanding of the diversity of the organism being targeted, and the particular mission constraints that may dictate the detection chemistry and platform to be used for either biodefense or public health.",

Most authors of published sequence data usually submit a final version of their sequence data sets to GenBank. However, numerous sequence databases exist that have organism-specific data that may not be found in GenBank during the interim period of data generation and manuscript preparation and those sites would need to be probed directly to obtain the most recent and up-to-date sequence data.

Draft genomes are composed of multiple sets of overlapping reads, called \u201ccontigs,\u201d potentially with little or no information about the order or orientation of the contigs relative to the original genome. Draft sequence is often described by a depth factor, which is a numeric statement about the average redundancy of coverage at any base position, and thus confidence. A 3\u00d7 draft sequence would have, on average, at least three overlapping reads that contain each base in the genome being sequenced; 8\u201310\u00d7 depth is a common stopping point for draft genome data generation for traditional Sanger sequencing (where read lengths averaging 800+ bp are common). More recent generations of sequencing based on pyrosequencing technology yield shorter reads (100\u2013200+ bp for Roche 454 sequencers and 32\u201375+ bp for machines from Illumina or Life Technologies) and may feature depths of 50\u00d7 or greater.",

Obviously, finished genomes are superior to drafts when it comes to performing annotation of gene content or other features, as well as for performing multiple sequence alignments to compare two or more genomes. In our experience at LLNL, an 8\u201310\u00d7 Sanger draft genome provides sufficient information for DNA signature design purposes (1).

Sometimes this is because no way is known to isolate and culture the particular organism(s) of interest. Only a tiny fraction of organisms can be cultured in vitro and our knowledge base is greatly skewed toward those that can. At other times it is because what is desired is a sampling of an entire community of organisms. Although numerous metagenomic samples have been sequenced, it is exceedingly rare for complete assemblies of sequence from multiple organisms to result. One exception is a very small symbiotic bacterial community found living in an extremely harsh acidic environment in a mine (2). Metagenomic data are not currently of much utility for genomic signature development. A recent paper on the acid mine bacterial community is providing clues about the evolution of viral resistance (3), which illustrates the vital role metagenomic sequencing will play in expanding our systems biology knowledge at both the organism and the ecosystem level.",

Failure happens because an MSA takes impractically long to finish due to the intractable computational complexity involved or due to a lack of memory.

Large amounts of sequence data are often required to represent the range of target diversity, sometimes dozens to hundreds of genomes. As noted previously, building multiple sequence alignments with many diverse genomes taxes the capabilities of most available software.

This approach implies that multiple signatures will be required for species-level detection of all subgroups. One must make an assessment in advance of signature design of how best to subdivide the target sequences. A second approach is to allow degenerate or inosine bases so that a single signature will detect more diverse genomes. Specificity may suffer if some combinations of degenerate bases also pick up nontarget species. Sensitivity may decline, as the specific priming sequence for a given target is diluted in the degenerate mix. A number of tools that require a multiple sequence alignment as input are available for degenerate primer design (e.g., SCPrimer, PrimaClade, Primo, Amplicon, and HYDEN). A third approach is to forego sequence alignment altogether and to look for sets of primer-length oligomers of length k, or \u201ck-mers,\u201d present in many targets and unique relative to nontarget sequences. Using combinatoric or greedy algorithms, one can build a signature set of k-mers such that each target contains at least two k-mers to function as forward and reverse primers. This approach demands large amounts of computing memory to store all candidate k-mers for large or many genomes, especially as k increases above 20, and may require suffix trees or other techniques for data compression.",

Because it avoids the need for multiple sequence alignment or a priori subgrouping of target sequences, this method can be run blindly without expert knowledge of the target species. It begins by removing nonunique regions from consideration as primers or probes from each of the target sequences relative to a database of nontarget sequences. The remaining unique regions of each target sequence are mined for all or many candidate signatures, without regard for conservation among other targets, yet satisfying user specifications for primer and probe length, T\nm, GC%, amplicon length, and so on. All candidate signatures are compared to all targets and clustered by the subset of targets they are predicted to detect. To predict detection, we may require that a signature's primers and probe have a perfect match to target in the correct orientation and proximity, or we may relax the match requirements to allow a limited number of mismatches, as long as T\nm remains above a specified threshold or those mismatches do not occur too close to the 3\u2032 end of a primer. Signatures within a given cluster are equivalent in that they are predicted to detect the same subset of targets, so by clustering we reduce the redundancy and size of the problem to finding a small set of signatures that detect all targets. Nevertheless, finding the optimal solution of the fewest clusters to detect all targets is an \u201cNP complete\u201d problem, so for large data sets we use a greedy algorithm to find a small number of clusters that together should pick up all targets. LLNL has used this method to design signature sets for numerous RNA viruses, including influenza A HA serotypes, foot and mouth disease, Norwalk, Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever, ebola, and other divergent viruses. Figure 29.1\nshows the result of an MSC computation for Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever performed in 2005, with the resulting signatures displayed against a whole genome phylogenetic tree of all the sequences available at that time.\n",

Even in cases where the gene is known, it may be difficult to rule out a natural origin for the outbreak. In such cases, it may be useful to search for more direct evidence of the genetic engineering tools used to insert and express foreign genes in a bacterial host. Among the most widely used and readily available tools for genetic engineering in bacteria are artificial vector DNA molecules. Genetic engineering with artificial vectors began with efforts to improve on early work using natural plasmids for gene cloning. Natural plasmids are extrachromosomal replicons (self-replicating molecules) that come in both circular and linear form and are generally nonessential genetic material for the bacterial host but can confer important phenotypes such as virulence and drug resistance. These plasmids are mobile genetic elements that serve as a natural mechanism for the exchange of genetic material across different bacterial species (8).

The large collection of artificial vector sequences can be clustered according to exact k-mer sequence matching to find the k-mers shared among different vector sequences (10). Sequence length k corresponds to the desired probe length used in the microarray design. Each cluster of shared sequence is compared against all available sequenced natural chromosomal bacterial and viral genomes, including natural plasmids to identify which k-mers in the artificial vector sequence are distinct from the natural background. These unique k-mers are called candidate signatures. After candidate signatures are found, a probe set is created that ensures that each vector contributes a preset minimum number of candidate signatures to the final microarray probe set design.

Cross-validation can be used to estimate a similarity threshold for distinguishing artificial and natural genomic sets. [An example of this approach using cross-validation is given elsewhere (10).] Another postprocessing step is to tune the probe set to ensure probes derived from each vector come from multiple functional regions. Confidence in vector detection is boosted when probes are found for multiple functional locations. Using probes from multiple regions may also provide useful forensic information on the origins and function of the detected artificial vector.

Array design to span an entire kingdom on a single microarray demands substantial investment in probe selection algorithms. LLNL designed a microarray to detect all bacteria, plasmids, and viruses based on all available whole genome, whole segment, and whole plasmid sequences and is in the process of including probes for highly conserved fungal genes as well. We attempted to find probes that are unique to each viral and bacterial family, and favor probes conserved within a family. We used probes 50\u201365 bases long, enabling sensitive detection of targets with some sequence variation relative to the probe. We used a greedy minimal set cover algorithm to ensure that all sequences have at least 50 (for viruses) or 15 (for bacteria and plasmids) probes per sequence. We allowed some mismatches between probe and target, based on previous mismatch experiments in which we determined that probes with a contiguous match at least 29 bases long and with 85% sequence similarity between probe and target still gave a strong signal intensity.

The current flood of metagenomic data is presenting us with an even larger problem: what exactly do concepts such as \u201cspecies\u201d and \u201cstrains\u201d mean if it turns out that microbial life is a broad spectrum with few well-defined transitions? It is now common to refer to a \u201ccore genome\u201d and additional distinct gene content variation that presumably is responsible for different phenotypes (19). It is possible that new concepts and terminology will be needed to map existing taxonomic categories into the genomic reality of the 21st century.",

The field of pathogen diagnostics is riding this technology wave, too small a market to have any direct influence. Note that the read lengths of some new sequencing technologies may be too short to provide confident pathogen identification based on a single read, meaning that direct metagenomic identification of human pathogens from complex clinical or environmental samples contains some degree of uncertainty. Microarrays will have to ride their own faster/less expensive/more-information-per-chip curve if they are not to become obsolete within a few years. Alternatively, one could argue that future advances in protein detection technology could lead to breakthroughs in fast dipstick assays (similar to current home pregnancy test kits) that could provide fast, accurate, and inexpensive results for pathogen detection. In all likelihood, all these techniques will continue to compete as they evolve asynchronously.",
