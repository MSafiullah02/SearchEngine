We further excluded individuals with excessive relatives, a mismatch between the self-reported and genetically inferred gender, putative sex chromosome aneuploidy, and those who were identified by the UK Biobank as outliers. Finally, we identified the maximal set of unrelated individuals (no 3rd degree or closer relatives) based on the pairwise kinship coefficients provided by UKBB [1, 2] . After applying QC, the remaining number of individuals was 1460, of whom 526 were positive (case) and 934 were negative (control) for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Similarly, 835 (57%) of them were inpatient. Figure S1 .
