            "text": "The beginning of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy is rooted directly in the discovery of nitrogen mustard. Mustard gas (sulfur mustard, H-gas) had been used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I, the first documented battlefield use being in Ypres, Belgium in 1917. The name assigned to the gas by the German military was Lost (referring to Lommel and Steinkopf, who in 1916 proposed the military use to the German Imperial General Staff). Exposure to mustard gas induces severe injuries to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. In 1917, Krumbhaar, a Captain in the U.S. Medical Corps, noted the development of profound leukopenia in individuals who survived a gas attack for several days (Krumbhaar 1919; Krumbhaar and Krumbhaar 1919) . Following up on this observation, a group from the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) at Yale Medical School secretly studied the effects of nitrogen mustard on lymphomata. Milton Winternitz, who had worked on sulfur mustards in World War I, obtained the OSRD contract to study the chemistry of mustard compounds. He recruited the pharmacologists Louis S. Goodman and Alfred Gilman Brink et al. 2006; Nay 2013) to perform the necessary animal experiments. Based on their successful research, Gustav Lindskog successfully treated a radio-resistant lymphosarcoma that compressed a patient's trachea with the injection of nitrogen mustard in December 1942. In 1943, Goodman and Gilman initiated the experimental treatment of Hodgkin disease and lymphosarcoma with nitrogen mustard. None of this was made public until 1946, when Goodman and Gilman reported their observation that exposure to mustard gas caused profound lymphoid and myeloid suppression, suggesting its utility for the treatment of lymphomata (Goodman et al. 1946; Gilman and Philips 1946) . There was a parallel development: In World War II, General Eisenhower had ordered that a stockpile of mustard gas be kept near the front for possible use in a reprisal if the Nazis resorted to chemical warfare. During a military operation, allied ships in Bari Harbor, Italy 4 , were sunk in an air assault by the German Luftwaffe on 2nd December 1943. At the center of the destruction was the vessel Liberty Ship S.S. John Harvey, laden with ammunition, supplies, and 2000 mustard gas bombs. A large number of military personnel were accidentally exposed to mustard gas and were later found by U.S. medical officer Lieutenant Colonel Stewart F. Alexander to have abnormally low white blood cell counts as a consequence of poisoning. It was implied that an agent, which damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells, might have a similar effect on cancer cells. Cornelius P. Rhoads served as chief of the medical division of the U.S. Army's chemical warfare unit during World War II. Based on his experience in the Bari incident, he investigated mustard gas as a tumor killing agent (Rhoads 1946) . The research presaged classical chemotherapy 5 . Rhoads moved on to head one of the largest drug development programs at the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York and pioneered the practice of contract research for pharmaceutical companies under confidentiality agreements. Mustard gas is not derived from the mustard plant, it gets its name from its impurities. Impure mustard gas is yellowbrown and has an odor resembling mustard plants. Upon contact with the skin, it causes a burning sensation, which is similar to that caused by the oil from black mustard seeds. Sulfur mustards (bis(2-chloroethyl)-sulfide, 1,5-dichloro-3-thiapentane), which are related to mustard gas, are vesicants that have the ability to form large blisters on exposed skin. While sulfur mustards are too toxic for medical applications, nitrogen mustards 6 have found use as therapeutics. 5 The recognition would have assured Rhoads' place in medical history had it not been revealed that he had likely committed serious ethics violations in unrelated assignments. In Puerto Rico, 1931, after Rhoads' car had been vandalized he wrote generally hateful comments on Puerto Ricans in a letter. He claimed that he had deliberately injected several Puerto Rican citizens with cancer cells. 6 The characteristic bis(2-chloroethyl)amine-domain, which generates DNA cross-links, is contained in nitrogen mustards, phosphoramide mustards (ifosphamide is unique in its chain length that generates 7-membered cross-links), and selective minor groove DNA binding antibiotics (tallimustine and MEN 10710).

Mechlorethamine hydrochloride is used because it induces a rapid response. It is primarily administered as part of the MOPP regimen. The agent may be indicated in treating Hodgkin disease (stages III and IV), lymphosarcoma, chronic myelocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera 7 , mycosis fungoides 8 , and bronchogenic carcinoma.

The agent is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily to phenylacetic acid mustard, which has anti-neoplastic activity. Chlorambucil and its major metabolite spontaneously degrade, forming monohydroxyl and dihydroxyl derivatives. Both chlorambucil and its metabolites are extensively bound to plasma and tissue proteins (99 %), specifically to Albumin. Urinary excretion is below 1 % in 24 h. Adverse Effects A prominent adverse effect is myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Severe neutropenia usually occurs only in patients who have received a total dosage of 6.5 mg/kg or more in one course of therapy with continuous dosing. Upon withdrawal from the drug, this effect may be reversible after about 10 days from the last dose, but bone marrow failure can arise in rare cases. Less commonly occurring adverse effects are gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, oral ulcerations) and central nervous system damage (tremors, muscular twitching, confusion, agitation, ataxia, hallucinations; increased risk of seizures in children with nephrotic syndrome and patients receiving high pulse doses of chlorambucil) that often resolves upon discontinuation of the drug, skin reactions (urticaria, angioneurotic edema, rarely skin rash progressing to erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and infertility (sterility when administered to prepubertal and pubertal males, induction of amenorrhea in females). Uncommon adverse reactions include pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity and jaundice, drug fever, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial pneumonia, and sterile cystitis.

It was first marketed in Germany in the early 1970s. In 2008, bendamustine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The drug also has therapeutic activity against multiple myeloma, and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has progressed within 6 months of treatment with a rituximab containing regimen. For these conditions, bendamustine has strong efficacy as well as low cross-resistance with other alkylating agents and fludarabine. The agent causes DNA damage that leads to cell death via several pathways, including apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. A standard dose is 100-120 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered intravenously over a period of 30-60 min, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia on days 1 and 2 of a 28day cycle up to six cycles, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle up to eight cycles.",

Tumor lysis syndrome can arise within the first treatment cycle. Without intervention it may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include maintaining adequate volume status, and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels.

Prolonged treatment produces elevated total blood concentrations of estradiol. The metabolic urinary patterns of the estradiol moiety of estramustine phosphate and estradiol itself are very similar, although the metabolites derived from estramustine phosphate are excreted at a slower rate. Estramustine may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. 2.1 Alkylating Agents Adverse Effects Adverse effects caused by estramustine include allergic reactions, with hives, difficulty breathing, and blood clots. Accordingly, contraindications for this agent are hypersensitivity to estradiol or nitrogen mustard. Hypertension may be a consequence and blood pressure should be checked periodically. Gynecomastia and impotence are possible estrogenic effects. Careful monitoring of treatment is required in specific risk groups: -There is an increased risk of thrombosis, including fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, in men receiving estrogens for prostatic cancer. Estramustine capsules should be used with caution in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, or thromboembolic disorders, especially if these events were associated with prior estrogen therapy. Active thrombophlebitis is a contraindication. Caution should also be used in patients with cerebral vascular disease or coronary artery disease. However, estramustine may be given in cases where the actual tumor mass is the cause of the thromboembolic phenomenon and the benefits of therapy may outweigh the risks. DHEA mustard is a steroidal alkylating agent. The natural steroid hormone (produced from cholesterol by the adrenal glands, gonads, adipose tissue, brain, and skin) and dietary supplement dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor to both estrogen and testosterone. While dehydroepiandrosterone may have an anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effect on cancer cell lines (Schulz et al. 1992; Yang et al. 2002) , the clinical significance of these effects may be low.",

Alopecia caused by cyclophosphamide is common, but usually temporary despite continued administration of the drug. Skin rashes occur occasionally in patients receiving the drug. Pigmentation of the skin and changes in nails can arise. Interstitial pneumonitis or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide over a prolonged period. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone secretion) 12 is a rare adverse effect with the use of cyclophosphamide.",

Scarboxymethylcysteine can account for about 80 % of the administered dose of ifosfamide (K\u00fcpfer et al. 1996) , which is then further degraded metabolically to thiodiglycolic acid (TDGA) (Hofmann et al. 1991) .

It includes a bioisostere of alanine (1-amino ethylphosphonic acid) in order to facilitate cellular penetration and passage across the blood-brain barrier. Fotemustine alkylates guanine by forming chloroethyl adducts at the 6 position, resulting in N1 guanine-N3 cytosine cross-linkages. This leads to an inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell cycle arrest, and finally cell death. As a result of its alkylating and carbamoylating effect, the drug exerts a potent cytostatic activity on cells in cycle, inducing an accumulation of cells in G 2 /M phase. Fotemustine is indicated for disseminated malignant melanoma. An interval of 8 weeks after the start of induction treatment and 3 weeks after each cycle of maintenance treatment is recommended. The agent should not be administered to patients who received chemotherapy in the previous 4 weeks (6 weeks if the treatment included nitrosoureas).",

Triaziquone contains three ethylene imine rings linked to a quinone nucleus. This drug is a substrate for both one-electron and two-electron reducing agents and its cytotoxic activity may result from protein alkylation and oxidative stress. It is a polyfunctional compound, which combines the properties of a quinone, an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, an enamine, and an aziridine (ethylene imine). Triaziquone exerts its anti-cancer effects through macromolecule alkylation of functional groups like -SH, -OH, and -NH 2 . Since triaziquone has three aziridine groups with slightly different reactivity, it can react successively three times as an akylating reagent. By this mechanism, different parts of the DNA (even from different strands) can be connected. Crosslinks may also be formed between DNA and other molecules, such as proteins (Rademacher 1995) . Both the rate of reaction and the number of aziridine groups per molecule of trenimon that react are dependent on the acidity of the micro-environment. Therefore, the reactivity is increased in the acidic milieu of tumors. Triaziquone is especially efficacious for the treatment of polycythemias and carcinomatous effusions. The therapeutic dose is about 1 mg/kg body mass. 19 Alkylating anti-cancer drugs with 3-membered rings include ethylene imines, some methylmelamines (triethylenemelamine), benzoquinones, illudins and acylfulvenes, dianhydrogalactitol, and teroxirone. 20 Aziridines (ethylene imines) include benzoquinones and thio-TEPA. Phosphoramide mustards and mitomycins may be metabolized to highly reactive aziridine derivatives. The Caspase activator imexon (see Sect. 3.3.4.) is a cyanoaziridine.",

The discovery soon initiated studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division. Various platinum salts were synthesized, and cis-diamminetetrachloroplatinum, but not its trans-isomer, was identified to be the most effective inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation.

Although many cellular components interact with cisplatin, DNA is the primary biological target of the drug. Most notable among the DNA changes are the 1,2 intra-strand cross-links with purine bases. These include 1,2 intra-strand d(GpG) adducts, which form nearly 90 % of the adducts, and the less common 1,2 intra-strand d(ApG) adducts. 1,3 intra-strand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily eliminated by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism (Farrell 2003) . Cisplatin modifications distort the structure of the DNA duplex. The intra-strand 1,2 cross-links bend the DNA significantly towards the major groove, exposing a wide, shallow minor groove surface, to which HMG box proteins, repair proteins, transcription factors, and Histone H1 bind. The affinity of the high mobility group protein HMGB1 for cisplatin-damaged DNA is enhanced by P53. This can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Further, HMG box proteins, such as HMGB1 (HMG Box Protein 1) and tsHMG (testes specific HMG Box Protein) shield the Pt-1,2-d(GpG) crosslink from nucleotide excision repair proteins.",

            "text": "Drug Resistance If ovarian cancer recurs within less than 6 months after the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor is considered to be platinum resistant. Resistance to cisplatin can be caused by several mechanisms (Farrell 2003; Wang and Lippard 2005) . It may be due to a combination of -increased efflux of platinum from the cell. The transporter ATP7B (Copper Transporting P-Type Adenosine Triphosphate) has an important physiological role in regulating copper levels in the cell. It is associated with cisplatin resistance in various cancers. ABCC2 (ATP-Binding Cassette sub-family C 2, MRP2, cMOAT) also has a role in cisplatin resistance, presumably by promoting drug efflux. -increased cytoplasmic detoxification through cellular thiols such as Glutathione (GSH). Due to the affinity of Pt II for sulfur binding, platinum drugs can bind to Glutathione, Metallothionein, and serum Albumin. Therefore, the cellular thiol levels are associated with drug resistance. -increased resistance to apoptosis. The kinase PKB (Protein Kinase B, AKT) promotes cell survival and downregulates apoptosis. An elevated activity of PKB associated pathways protects cells from apoptotic death induced by cisplatin. c-ABL is a member of the SRC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which also carries a DNA binding motif. Nuclear c-ABL activity can be stimulated by cisplatin and acts to transmit DNA damage signals. Because c-ABL tyrosine kinase has a role in cisplatin mediated activation of apoptosis, a reduction in its activity can confer cisplatin resistance. The P53 pathway can partially mediate cisplatin cytotoxicity. Many tumors harbor defective P53 and are deficient in this pathway. -enhanced repair of platinum-DNA adducts. Cisplatin-DNA adducts are removed primarily by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism. High levels of nucleotide repair proteins in cancer cells can mediate resistance. The favorable clinical response of testicular cancer to cisplatin reflects, in part, its intrinsically low levels of the nucleotide excision repair proteins XPA and ERCC1/ XPF. DNA Polymerase \u03b7 is a lesion bypass polymerase that aids tumor cells to gain resistance against cisplatin based chemotherapy. It allows cells to reduplicate DNA across cross-link lesions such as 1,2-d(GpG) cisplatin adducts (Pt-GG).",

This third generation platinum analog received U.S. FDA approval in 2002. In this organoplatinum agent, the platinum atom is complexed with 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) and with an oxalate ligand as a leaving group. After displacement of the labile oxalate leaving group, active oxaliplatin derivatives (such as monoaquo-and diaquo-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum) alkylate macro-molecules, forming both inter-and intrastrand platinum-DNA cross-links, which result in the inhibition of DNA reduplication and transcription, and in cell cycle non-specific cytotoxicity. The 1,2-diaminocyclohexane side chain may counteract alkylating agent resistance. Oxaliplatin is typically administered by infusion every 2 weeks in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity sets in) or for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in patients who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor (12 cycles over 6 months). For this malignancy, oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) has increased the response rates from 15 % for 5-fluorouracil alone to over 40 %, although the increases in overall survival rates are modest. The FOLFOX regimen is the most common combination therapy use for oxaliplatin.",

Bioreduced mitomycin C alkylates DNA, produces inter-strand DNA cross-links, and generates oxygen radicals, thereby inhibiting DNA reduplication (Fig. 2.23 ). Mitomycin C at high concentrations also inhibits RNA and protein synthesis. There is effectiveness against hypoxic, radioresistant cells. The drug is most effective in the front line treatment of select solid tumors, including superficial bladder cancer, and gastric, pancreatic, anal, and esophageal carcinomata. Mitomycin C has been used extensively as a single agent in the treatment of gastric cancer, especially in Japan, with an overall objective response rate of 30 %. More recently, the drug has also been extensively applied in combination chemotherapy regimens. It is used in the palliative treatment of cancers that are advanced or have become resistant to other forms of therapy, generally in combination regimens with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil or with bleomycin and vincristine. Mitomycin C is normally administered intravenously at a single dose of 20 mg/m 2 or at 2 mg/m 2 /day over 12 days. Other forms of drug delivery are used for specific tumors. Cycles are repeated every 6-8 weeks, provided the leucocyte and platelet counts have recovered sufficiently.

The agent is less toxic to tumor cells than mitomycin C under aerobic conditions, but shows similar or greater activity under hypoxic conditions. Thus, porfiromycin has a greater hypoxic:oxic ratio and has greater preferential toxicity to hypoxic cells than mitomycin C.

Approximately 5 % of patients receiving the drug develop pulmonary toxicity, including non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonitis and pleural effusions, leading to progressive respiratory insufficiency and death. Corticosteroid therapy can improve the pulmonary symptoms. The risk for this toxicity may increase with exposure to high oxygen concentrations or when mitomycin C is combined with other anticancer drugs that cause pulmonary toxicity (like bleomycin). 5-15 % of patients treated with mitomycin C develop cancer associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which comprises a complex of micro-angiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure that may lead to death.

With current treatment protocols, acute toxicity is infrequent, afflicting no more than 1 % of patients, and it is usually reversible. An even more rare acute complication may consist of myocarditis and pericardial effusion, occurring a few weeks after anthracycline administration (Zucchi and Danesi 2003) . Chronic cardiac toxicity may develop any time after completion of anthracycline regimens. The prolonged administration induces cardiomyopathy-usually within a year, but very late forms of cardiac dysfunction can arise. Children may develop cardiotoxicity at longer intervals after treatment completion. Chronic cardiomyopathy can evolve into congestive heart failure, which is refractory to standard inotropic medications. The risk for cardiotoxicity is high in patients who have been given cumulative anthracycline doses above 550 mg/m 2 . It may occur at lower cumulative doses if anthracyclines are given in combination with agents like taxanes or trastuzumab (anti-ERBB2), and possibly also in conjunction with COX-2 inhibitors. The adverse effects include the loss of myofibrils, dilation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic vacuolization, swelling of the mitochondria, and increased numbers of lysosomes. The main mechanism of anthracycline dependent cardiac toxicity is the induction of apoptosis. Cardiomyocytes are more susceptible than other tissues because they exhibit low levels of Catalase and readily undergo inactivation of GSH-PX1 (Selenium-Dependent GSH-Peroxidase-1) after drug exposure. Protection from the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines can be achieved by slow infusion (48-96 h), provision of antioxidants (flavonoids), and administration of iron chelators such as dexrazoxane (ICRF-187, ADR 529) <Zinecard, Totect>. According to the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the use of dexrazoxane is recommended in -patients who have received more than 300 mg/m 2 for metastatic breast cancer and who may benefit from continued doxorubicin treatment -patients who have received more than 300 mg/m 2 doxorubicin for the treatment of malignancies other than breast cancer -patients who responded to previous anthracycline based chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer and who may benefit from continued therapy with epirubicin (Schuchter et al. 2002) .",

The diaminoalkyl groups are crucial for the biological activity of these compounds. However, while the anthracenedione mitoxantrone is less cardiotoxic than the anthracyclines, it is also somewhat less effective. Ametantrone and mitoxantrone are structurally similar members of the class. While both drugs are strong intercalators, their cytostatic, cytotoxic, and anti-tumor activities differ, with mitoxantrone being 10-100 times more potent on a molar basis. There is a correlation between their potency and their ability to condense nucleic acids inasmuch as mitoxantrone condenses nucleic acids at concentrations that are 5-40-fold lower than those of ametantrone. The condensation is base-and sugar-specific, with the long purine sequences of single stranded RNA being the most sensitive (Kapuscinski and Darzynkiewicz 1986) .

The unique structures of antibiotics in this class (Fig. 2.30 ) contribute to their very high potency as anti-tumor agents (Sugiura et al. 1989 ). The heart of these molecules is a bicyclo [7.3.1] tridecane system that combines a methyl trisulfide and double and triple bonds in a 3-ene-1,5-diyne formation. The enediyne group readily undergoes cyclo-aromatization via a diradical intermediate. The highly reactive radical is capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms from the DNA backbone, resulting in DNA damage at specific sites (Table 2 .3) and giving rise to a powerful anti-proliferative activity. Enediyenes bind at specific sites to the minor groove of doublehelical DNA and inflict primarily sequence specific DNA double-strand breaks. These drugs have three important functional domains, -an assemblage that consists of an enediyne moiety -a delivery system that conveys the enediyne moiety to its DNA target -a triggering device that, when activated, initiates a cascade of reactions that generate the reactive chemical species (Shao and Zhen 2008) .",

Neocarcinostatin consists of a non-protein chromophor, which is complexed with a protein carrier and stabilizer. The aminoglycoside component intercalates into DNA, and the benzene diradical intermediate of the enediyne core binds to the minor groove of double-helical DNA at 5\u2032-GGAGCGC-3\u2032 sites. Neocarzinostatin requires sulfhydryl activation.

SMANCS was approved in Japan in 1993 for the treatment of hepatoma, gastric carcinoma, and lung cancer. SMANCS may also be beneficial in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Hepatic arterial infusion of a SMANCS/Lipiodol emulsion has been used as a treatment for advanced or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.

SN-38 amounts in the intestinal lumen play an essential role in the delayed severe diarrhea that prevents dose intensification and efficacy in up to 40 % of treated patients. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 h after administration) can be life threatening as it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Late diarrhea should be treated promptly with loperamide. Before the next ensuing chemotherapy administration, patients should return to pre-treatment bowel function without requiring antidiarrhea medications for at least 24 h. Intestinal biota play essential roles in carbohydrate metabolism, vitamin production, and the processing of bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics.

The drug exerts its anti-neoplastic properties by binding to and inhibiting Topoisomerase 2, which prevents the religation of cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of strand breaks, the inhibition of DNA reduplication, and apoptotic cell death. It acts primarily in the G 2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Etoposide is used in combination chemotherapy, mainly to treat refractory testicular cancer following unsuccessful standard treatment and in first-line treatment for small cell lung cancers. It also has use in the treatment of chorionic carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant melanoma, and lymphomata.

Pharmacokinetics On intravenous administration, the disposition of etoposide follows a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of about 1.5 h and a terminal elimination half-life of 4-11 h. In the blood, etoposide is 97 % protein bound. The cytotoxicity of the prodrug etoposide phosphate is lower than that of etoposide, which may be due to the necessity for conversion to the active moiety by dephosphorylation.

Nausea and vomiting are the major gastrointestinal toxicities. Their severity is generally mild to moderate with treatment discontinuation required in 1 % of patients. Nausea and vomiting can usually be controlled with standard anti-emetic therapy. Major additional adverse effects include reversible hair loss (45 % of patients), anorexia, and diarrhea.

            "text": "In one of the first examples of rational anti-cancer drug design, he collaborated with Harriett Kilte and Lederle Laboratories of the American Cyanamid Company to devise folate analogs. In November 1947, when a sufficient amount of aminopterin became available 36 , Farber administered it to 16 children with acute leukemia and achieved remissions in ten of them. He demonstrated that aminopterin blocked a critical chemical reaction needed for DNA reduplication (Farber et al. 1948) . Aminopterin was the predecessor of methotrexate (developed by Seeger and colleagues at Lederle Laboratories in 1948 and called amethopterin), which in 1956 became the first compound cure of metastatic cancer, when it was used by Roy Hertz and Min Chiu Li (-1980) to treat two cases of choriocarcinoma. The principal architect of the treatment, using methotrexate in an unusual way for the time, was Min Chiu Li. As a sign of the times, after the first two patients went into remission, they were presented at National Cancer Institute Grand Rounds under the title \"the spontaneous regression of cancer\" with the speaker being Gordon Zubrod (Li's superior and at that time a detractor of chemotherapy). Li was told if he persisted in using his radical treatment, he would have to forfeit his position at the newly opened clinical center. He continued and was asked to leave. After his initial success with methotrexate, Li went on to develop the first effective combination chemotherapy programs for metastatic testicular cancer (DeVita and Chu 2008). In 1972, when the Lasker Prize was awarded to investigators who had contributed to studies of 36 Aminopterin was synthesized by Yellapragada Subbarao at Lederle Laboratories. Subbarao had been denied tenure at Harvard, despite his discovery of the roles of phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in muscular activity. He joined Lederle, where he developed a method to synthesize folic acid, and with considerable input from Farber, he produced anti-folates. Subbarao remained obscure because he did not actively publicize his work or himself. It was said that some of the nucleotides isolated by him at Harvard Medical School had to be rediscovered years later by other workers because his superior, Cyrus Fiske, apparently out of jealousy, had not let Subbarao's contributions see the light of the day. ferred as the initial combination chemotherapy in these patients because etoposide is associated with an increased risk for secondary tumors. -While patients with low-risk stages 2 and 3 are treated with primary single agent chemotherapy with methotrexate or actinomycin D, patients with high-risk disease are managed with primary combination chemotherapy with EMA-CO. Patients with disease resistant to single agent chemotherapy are then treated with EMA-CO. Patients with disease resistant to EMA-CO may be treated by modifying that regimen by substituting cisplatin and etoposide on day 8, and escalating the dose of methotrexate infusion to 1 g/m 2 (EMA-CE). -All patients with stage 4 disease are managed with primary EMA-CO combination chemotherapy. In the presence of cerebral metastases, the methotrexate dosage in the infusion is increased to 1 g/m 2 . Patients with disease resistant to EMA-CO may then be treated with EMA-CE (Kufe et al. 2003) .",

Gertrude Belle Elion was a medicinal chemist interested in the pharmacology of anti-purines. She had enrolled in City College of New York at the age of 15 (importantly, it was tuition-free as her father had been bankrupted by the stock market crash), and earned her chemistry degree from Hunter College at age 19. Unable to obtain a graduate research position due to gender discrimination during the great depression, she worked as a laboratory assistant and a high school chemistry teacher. During that period, her fianc\u00e9 died from endocarditis. Elion never married and it seems that her love was entirely devoted to medicinal chemistry. She finally took a position as an assistant to George H. Hitchings (1905 Hitchings ( -1998 at the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Company. From 1942 on, research by Hitchings and Elion tested many purine analogs and corroborated that it was possible to treat cancer with anti-metabolite compounds.

In Burkitt lymphoma, a recommended dosage for stage I-II disease is 10-25 mg/day orally for 4-8 days; for stage III-IV disease, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with other anti-tumor agents with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625-2.5 mg/kg daily. Pharmacokinetics The oral absorption of methotrexate is dose dependent. At doses below 30 mg/m 2 , methotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60 %. The absorption of doses greater than 80 mg/m 2 is significantly less, possibly due to a saturation effect. Peak blood levels are reached within 1-2 h. In leukemic pediatric patients, there is substantial interindividual variability in both, oral bioavailability and time to peak concentration. Factors that decrease the absorption of the drug and reduce its peak concentration include food, oral non-absorbable antibiotics, and rapid transit through the gastrointestinal tract as it occurs in diarrhea, while slower transit time in the gastrointestinal tract from constipation will increase the absorption. Oral methotrexate is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to the inactive 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA), which accounts for less than 5 % loss of the dose. In contrast, the drug is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of administration. After intramuscular injection, peak blood concentrations occur in 30-60 min. In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphocytic leukemia, the terminal half-life ranges 0.5-6 h. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier in therapeutic amounts, however, high cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of the agent may be attained by intrathecal administration.",

After uptake, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and cancer cell metabolism to polyglutamated forms. blocked, comprising the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate ( THF), 1-carbon donors (1 C donors), and the production of essential molecules for cell proliferation regulatory elements are associated with clinical outcome in the treatment of osteosarcoma or childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In high doses, passive diffusion of the drug can to some degree overcome tumor cell resistance caused by saturated active transport systems. Cancers can become resistant to antifolates by amplification of dihydrofolate reductase or decreased affinity of Dihydrofolate Reductase for methotrexate. Other potential causes of resistance are slow rates of thymidylate synthesis and lack of polyglutamation within tumor cells.",

Because tumors tend to use more uracil than orotic acid for nucleic acid synthesis, Charles Heidelberger reasoned that an anti-metabolite resembling uracil would show some selectivity for inhibiting tumors over normal tissues. He hypothesized \"because acetic acid is vinegar and fluoroacetic acid is rat poison\" a fluorine-substituted compound might be active. Such substitution in position five of the uracil ring was feasible and stable. The substitution also interfered with the synthesis of thymine nucleotides from uracil nucleotides. This rationale resulted in the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil.

Doxifluridine (5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine) is a fluoropyrimidine derivative and oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, designed to circumvent the rapid degradation of 5-fluorouracil by Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase in the gut wall and liver. The agent is converted into 5-fluorouracil by Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase. \u2022 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) is a folate based biomodulator that stabilizes the covalent binding of the fluorouracil metabolite 5-5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine-5\u2032-Omonophosphate (FdUMP) to its target enzyme, Thymidylate Synthase. The binding results in enzyme inhibition and depletion of the essential DNA constituent thymidine triphosphate (TTP). Tumor cell death ensues. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, as the active form of folate, does not require metabolic activation and may exceed the chemotherapeutic effects of fluorouracil with lower toxicity. \u2022 Tegafur (5-fluoro-1-(oxolan-2-yl)pyrimidine-2,4-dione, tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil) is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil by Cytochrome P450 in the liver. Tegafur competes with uridine triphosphate, thus inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis. \u2022 Tegafur-uracil (UFT) <Ftorafur, Tefudex, Ufur, Uftoral> is a formulated oral agent consisting of a combination of the 5-fluorouracil prodrug, tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil, and uracil (1:4). Because of its higher concentration in the combination, uracil saturates the uracil reducing enzymatic activity of Ddihydropyrimidine Ddehydrogenase, thereby inhibiting first pass hepatic metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and permitting its administration as the orally bioavailable prodrug tetrahydrofuranyl-5-fluorouracil. Tegafur-uracil was developed in Japan during the 1980s. The drug has been administered on a continuous daily basis for 6-65 months at 300-400 mg per day in divided doses (metronomic dosing), in cycles of 5 days dosed at 300 mg/m 2 per day followed by the weekend off, or in cycles of 28 days dosed at 300-600 mg/m 2 per day followed by a week off. \u2022 S-1 was developed in Japan. It is an anti-pyrimidine preparation composed of tegafur combined with two modulators of 5-flurouracil activity, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate, in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine is a reversible inhibitor of Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase, the liver enzyme responsible for rapid catabolism of 5-fluorouracil into inactive metabolites. Potassium oxonate preferentially localizes in the gut and inhibits the enzyme Orotate Phosphoribosyl Transferase, which is the major enzyme responsible for 5-fluorouracil activation. Thus it decreases the activation of 5-fluorouracil in the gut and the associated gastrointestinal toxicity. S-1 is orally more active than 5-fluorouracil. \u2022 Capecitabine (5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluoro-N-[(pentyloxy) carbonyl]-cytidine) <Xeloda> is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with nearly 100 % oral bioavailability. As a prodrug, capecitabine is metabolized by the liver to 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine and subsequently to 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5\u2032-dFUR). 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine is converted to 5-fluorouracil by Thymidine Phosphorylase, which is present in amounts 3-10-fold higher in neoplastic tissue compared with untransformed tissue. A typical daily oral dose is 1250-2000 mg/m 2 . It is split into morning and evening intake (within 30 min after a meal) for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest to complete a cycle. Capecitabine may be used in mono-therapy or combination chemotherapy. It is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of Dukes C colon cancer 41 following the complete resection of the primary tumor, as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma, for metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline containing chemotherapy (combination with docetaxel), for metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and anthracycline containing chemotherapy or resistant to paclitaxel and contraindicated for anthracycline therapy. The safety profile of capecitabine is superior to that of 5-fluorouracil, with less diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, alopecia, and grade 3-4 neutropenia, but a higher incidence of hand and foot syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia (typically unconjugated bilirubin). Care needs to be exercised when capecitabine is co-administered with CYP2C9 substrates. Patients receiving concomitant oral coumarin derivatives should have their anticoagulant response closely monitored. The phenytoin dose may need to be reduced when given simultaneously with capecitabine.",

In contrast to 5-fluorouracil, the entry of fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) into most neoplastic cells involves the saturable but non-concentrative mechanism for the facilitated diffusion of nucleosides. Fluorouridine and FdUrd, released from 5-fluorouridylic acid and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate by Phosphatase action, exit the cells via this same facilitated diffusion transporter (Fig. 2.45) . Thus, agents that affect this transporter may affect 5-fluorouracil cytotoxicity 42 .

Azathioprine has become one of the most commonly used anti-purine drugs. It is non-enzymatically cleaved to 6-mercaptopurine, the active agent that acts as a purine analog and an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Adverse Effects The principal and potentially serious toxic effects are hematologic and gastrointestinal. There are also risks of secondary infection and neoplasia. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions depend on the dose and duration of azathioprine treatment as well as on the underlying disease or concomitant therapies. Adverse effects of low frequency include skin rashes, alopecia, fever, arthralgias, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and reversible interstitial pneumonitis. Patients with low or absent Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT) activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life threatening myelotoxicity. The drug is Pregnancy Category D. Pharmacokinetics 6-Mercaptopurine is given orally at 2.5 mg/kg. However, the absorption of an oral dose is incomplete and variable, averaging approximately 50 %. Plasma protein binding is around 20 %. Variability in 6-mercaptopurine metabolism is one of the major causes of interindividual differences in systemic exposure to the drug and its active metabolites. The half-life of 6-mercaptopurine in the blood is shorter in pediatric patients than in adult patients. It ranges about 0.75-1.5 h, reflecting a combination of cellular uptake and degradation. 6-Mercaptopurine is inactivated via two major pathways, -thiol methylation is catalyzed by the highly polymorphic enzyme Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT), to form methyl-6-mercaptopurine. -oxidation is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidase and forms 6-thiouric acid.",

Clofarabine is a prodrug that gains entry into cells primarily by nucleoside transporter mechanisms. Nucleoside transporters are specialized proteins located in the cell membrane that mediate the uptake and release of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. Clofarabine is efficiently taken up via the equilibrative transporters hENT1 and hENT2, and the concentrative transporter hCNT247. The abundance of nucleoside transporters on a tumor or host cell may be a major determinant of the amount of nucleoside or nucleoside analog that is taken up into a particular tissue type. At higher concentrations and longer exposure times, the slightly lipophilic agent clofarabine also enters cells by passive diffusion across lipid membranes.",

Removal of the phosphates by 5\u2032-Nucleotidase is a prerequisite for the cellular export of clofarabine.

            "text": "The formation of poly-\u03b3-glutamyl metabolites, catalyzed by Folylpolyglutamate Synthase (FPGS), allows the prolonged retention of methotrexate in various tissues. These metabolites also have very high affinity to Thymidylate Synthase and potentiated inhibitory activity, and they are likely to exert a substantial portion of the drug action. The polyglutamated forms can be converted back to methotrexate by Hydrolases. At therapeutic doses, a small fraction of the drug may be metabolized to 7-hydroxymethotrexate. The aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3-5 fold lower than the parent compound.Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses. The terminal half-life for methotrexate is approximately 3-10 h for patients receiving low dose anti-neoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m 2 ). For patients receiving high doses of methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8-15 h. Renal excretion by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the primary mode of elimination, and is dependent on dosage and route of administration (with intravenous administration, 80-90 % of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 h). There is limited biliary excretion, amounting to 10 % or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate may occur. Delayed drug clearance is one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity. When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, third-space effusion, or other causes, the methotrexate blood concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods. The extent of adverse effects exerted on healthy tissues may be more dependent on the duration of exposure to the drug than on the peak level achieved.Adverse Effects In general, the incidence and severity of acute adverse effects are related to dose and frequency of methotrexate administration. There are assays available for the measurement of serum methotrexate levels that allow therapeutic drug monitoring, which also enables individualized dosing based on target levels. The threshold for cytotoxic effects of the agent is approximately 50 nM. Toxicity and efficacy are determined by the time span for which the concentrations remain above this threshold level.The high doses of methotrexate often used in cancer chemotherapy can cause toxic effects to the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal mucosa, resulting in myelosuppression (leukopenia, anemia) and mucositis (gingivitis, pharyngitis, ulcerative stomatitis). The myelosuppression can lead to potentially fatal opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, nocardiosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, Herpes zoster, Herpes simplex hepatitis, disseminated Herpes simplex). Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, hypotension, and thromboembolic events are possible. Respiratory fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, or chronic interstitial obstructive pulmonary disease can occasionally occur. There have been occurrences of central nervous system reac-tions to methotrexate, including myelopathies and leukoencephalopathies, especially when the agent was given via the intrathecal route. Methotrexate causes ocular adverse effects in up to 25 % of patients 38 . They may include blepharitis, periorbital edema, conjunctival hyperemia, increased tearing, or photophobia. Methotrexate is secreted into breast milk. Methotrexate exposure during pregnancy can lead to congenital malformations. It is Pregnancy Category X.Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, or pancreatitis can arise. These symptoms may be preventable by rescue therapy with folinic acid (leukovorin) supplements. High doses of methotrexate (generally doses greater than 1000 mg/m 2 ) require leucovorin rescue. Leucovorin must be administered until the levels fall below 50 nM.Although methotrexate competes with folate for Dihydrofolate Reductase, the enzyme inhibition caused by methotrexate is sometimes referred to as pseudo-irreversible because it cannot be displaced substantially by any physiologically attainable concentration of folate. Thus, an overdose of methotrexate cannot be corrected by administering folate. It requires folinic acid as an antidote.Drug Interactions Vitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives decrease the responses to systemically administered methotrexate. Vitamin C supplements can increase the adverse effects of methotrexate. Oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and non-absorbable broad spectrum antibiotics, may decrease the intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing the metabolism of the drug by bacteria. There is a risk of a severe adverse reaction if penicillin is prescribed alongside methotrexate. Methotrexate in the blood is approximately 50 % protein bound. It may be displaced by various compounds including sulfonamides, salicylates, phenylbutazone, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. The concurrent use of drugs that also undergo tubular secretion can markedly increase the methotrexate blood levels. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and probenecid reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high dose methotrexate therapy can elevate and prolong the blood methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.Drug Resistance The efflux transporter ABCG2 (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein, BCRP) exports polyglutamates out of cells, and mutations within the abcg2 gene may confer resistance to various antifolates. Polymorphisms of the gene slc19A1 ( reduced folate carrier, rfc), such as A80G, which encodes the uptake transporter for methotrexate, or its",
