Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 88,115 adult patients enrolled in the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) registry (2008) who had received HD for at least two years and were considered anuric. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at one year, and the secondary outcome was cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Estimated salt intake was the main predictor, and was calculated from interdialytic weight gain and pre-and postdialysis serum sodium levels according to the validated method of Kimura and Ramdeen. Nonlinear logistic regression was used to determine the association of salt intake with mortality, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, vintage of HD, dialysis time, Kt/V, protein catabolic rate normalized to body weight, comorbid conditions, type of vascular access, serum potassium, phosphate, calcium, CRP level, and endotoxin level in dialysate. Cubic splines were plotted and the reference was median salt intake. Salt consumption was categorized by intake levels of 2 g per day and the association with mortality examined. Results: Median [25th-75th percentile] salt intake at baseline was 6.4 [4.6-8.3] g per day. At one year, all-cause mortality occurred in 1,845 (2.1%) patients, including cardiovascular mortality in 821 (0.9%). We observed an association between low salt intake and clinical outcomes (all-cause and CV mortality) (Fig.1) . We observed the highest all-cause mortality in the low salt group (<6g/day) (Fig.2) , and no association between all-cause mortality and high salt intake. Further, we observed similar associations between salt intake and CV mortality. Conclusions: Low salt intake is associated with all-cause and CV mortality.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the demographic, clinical and biochemical determinants of cancer development in HD patients. Methods: The MONitoring Dialysis Outcomes (MONDO) consortium consists of HD databases from Renal Research Institute (RRI) clinics in the US, Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) clinics in Europe, Asia Pacific (AP), Latin America (LA), KfH clinics in Germany, Imperial College, London, UK, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel, and University of Maastricht, The Netherlands. We extracted data for only those patients who survived at least 12 months after the start of HD. Ninety-four HD patients with pre-existing cancer were excluded from the analysis. We used available variables to construct regression models to predict cancer development during 2 year follow-up. Candidate predictors included demographic characteristics (age, sex), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), smoking), body mass index (BMI), dialysis parameters (eKtV, urea reduction ratio (URR), vascular access, erythropoietin dosage, intra-dialytic weight gain (IDWG), normalized protein catabolic ratio (nPCR)) and laboratory tests (albumin, hemoglobin (Hgb), sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, ferritin, serum creatinine (sCR), white blood cell count, platelets, and total cholesterol). Continuous variables were converted into categorical ones based on optimal clinical cut off points in a preprocessing step. Categorical variables were pre-screened using Chi-square test (P < 0.1). Stepwise forward method was used for variable selection in the multiple logistic regression. Results: 22024 HD patients were studied (Eastern Europe: 4830, Western Europe: 367, Northern Europe: 1937 , Southern Europe: 7189, Western Asia: 2115 . The mean (SD) age was 63.2\u00b115.0 years, 58.7% were males. The overall incidence of cancer was 0.84% (185 cases), and 0.3% (57 cases) of HD patients had cancer-related death. The incidence of cancer was highest in Eastern Europe (1.6%, 78 cases) and lowest in Western (0.3%, 1 case) and Northern Europe (0.3%, 5 cases). Men older than 75 years had trend towards higher cancer incidence as compared to older female (1.2% vs 0.7%; P =0.07). The multivariable logistic regression model to predict two-year risk of cancer retained the following variables: age, BMI, ferritin, albumin, Hgb, eKtV, vascular access, CAD, diabetes, and IDWG. The model, significant predictors, and unstandardized \u03b2 coefficients with 95% CI are presented in Table 1 . Conclusions: Our study identifies clinical relevant risk factors to predict cancer in HD patients.

Dialysis modality has been hypothesized to be a potential immunomodulatory factor. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between dialysis modality and the risk for overall and specific infectious complications and to distinguish the risk for dialysis technique and non-dialysis technique related infections. Methods: Our study was conducted in The Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD) cohort that consists of 2052 incident dialysis patients. From this cohort, data on infectious complications of patients from 2 university teaching hospitals and 3 regional hospitals were retrospectively collected using strictly pre-specified criteria. Information about the incidence and nature of infections was collected from dialysis start until death, modality switch, withdrawal from the study, transfer to another dialysis center, kidney transplantation, or at the end of study follow up. Age-standardized incidence rates for infections were calculated. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios that were adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, Kahn co-morbidity score, primary kidney disease, ethnicity, malignancy, chronic pulmonary disease and educational level. Results: In total, 452 patients with complete medical records were included, of whom 285 started with haemodialysis (HD) and 167 with peritoneal dialysis (PD). The median follow-up time on the first dialysis modality was similar on HD and PD: 1.8 and 2.0 years. During the first 6 months, the age-standardized infection incidence rate was significantly higher on HD: Introduction and Aims: Increasing evidence are showing that high dose haemodialysis (more frequent and/or longer duration hemodialysis (HD)) can improve clinical and humanistic outcomes. We compared the expected health gains (measured as life-years -LYs -and quality-adjusted life-years -QALYs -gained) if high dose HD and other home dialysis modalities were used in a greater proportion of the dialysis patients than currently observed. Methods: A Markov model was built for the UK environment. Various combinations of high dose HD (in-center or at home) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) were compared to the current usage (i.e., 83% conventional in-center HD; 14% PD; 3% conventional home HD; 0% high dose home HD). Inputs included: incidence, prevalence, transplant rates (UK renal registry); complications, utilities and transition between modalities (medical literature); survival (PD & conventional HD: ERA-EDTA registry; high dose HD: medical literature). The model was run for 5 years with the prevalent dialysis population and an incident cohort entering the model each year in years 2-5. Results: Over the 5-year period, the scenario where all patients received in-center conventional HD generated a loss of 678 LYs (-0.6%) and 838 QALYs (-1.2%) for the cohort. Treating all patients with high dose HD in-center or at home, although likely unrealistic, increased the cohort's LYs by 4.5-4.8% and QALYs by 10.7-26.7%. All other (less extreme) scenarios led to increasing LY and QALY gains with increasing usage of home modalities. A more realistic scenario where 10% of patients received high dose HD at home and PD usage was back to years 2005-2008 levels, i.e., 25%, generated 963 LY (+0.8%) and 1827 QALY (+2.6%) gains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP605 FIRST DIALYSIS MODALITY AND THE RISK FOR DIALYSIS TECHNIQUE AND NON-DIALYSIS TECHNIQUE RELATED INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "Conclusions: This analysis shows that high dose HD, especially when performed at home has the potential to significantly increase the health gains of the dialysis population.

The question arising is no longer, if to treat these patients but how. Methods: Single centre data of all dialysis patients aged over 80 years were analyzed with regard to survival, social circumstances, vascular access and predialysis nephrology care. Results: Between 2001 and 2012 76 patients over 80 years of age started chronic ambulatory haemodialysis treatment. One-year survival was 87 %, 3-year survival 52 %, 5-year survival 27 % and 10-year survival 9 %, respectively. Patients (n = 55) with more than 3 month of nephrological care prior to dialysis (3 to 161 month, median 31 month) survived significantly longer then patients (n=21) having had less than 3 month contact to nephrologists. On 31th December 2012 there were 38 patients (18 female and 20 male) aged \u2265 80 years (median age 84 years, 80 -95 years) in the chronic haemodialysis program, thus accounting for 19% of all dialysis patients of this centre. The median duration on dialysis was 50 months (1 -155 months). All patients had two or more comorbidities.33 patients (87%) lived at home (9 patients single, 24 with spouse), 2 patients lived with relatives and 3 patients were nursing home residents. Concerning vascular access 31 patients (82%) had a native av-fistula, 3 (8%) a graft and 4 patients (10%) a catheter. The respective vascular access had been used for 43 month (1 -155 month) . 10 access complications occurred in 8 patients, in 4 cases a new vascular access had to be established (3 grafts, 1 catheter). Consequentially, one access was lost in 39 patient years on dialysis. Compared to all in-centre patients (one loss in 37 patient years) the elderly suffered less access failures overall. Prior to starting dialysis 30 patients (79%) had been in long-term nephrological care (3 -161 month, median 45 month) and 3 patients were referred late (< 3 month prior first dialysis). In 5 patients dialysis was started following emergency referral to hospital. 31 patients (82%) started the first dialysis treatment with a functioning shunt access, 4 (10%) with a permanent catheter and 3 (8%) with a temporary catheter. Conclusions: The life expectancy and social status of patients starting dialysis aged 80 years or older were nearly comparable to the general population of the same age. Long-term predialysis nephrology care is of most importance for successful dialysis treatment in the elderly especially in Octogenarians and Nonagenarians. Early establishment of a functioning vascular access and careful scheduling of first dialysis treatment reduce complications and increase both survival and quality of live.

This study has been designed in 2 parts. Part 1 is a cross-sectional study obtaining a snapshot view of patient well-being on aPD compared to HD. Part 2 is a prospective longitudinal study determining patient outcomes over 2 years. This report focuses on the results of Part 1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Comparison of quality of life and physical function of prevalent frail older patients on aPD and HD Methods: aPD patients (defined as requiring assistance to perform PD by paid or unpaid carer) and HD patients (requiring hospital transport) were recruited from 11 centres. All were \u226560 years, on dialysis for \u22653 months and free from hospitalisation for 30 days. The HD eligible patients were matched to recruited aPD participants by age (\u00b13 years), sex, diabetes status, time on dialysis (\u00b1 2 years), ethnicity and Index of Deprivation. Quality of life assessments were made using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), SF-12, Palliative Outcome Symptom Scale and Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale. Physical function was assessed by Barthel score (measure of aids to daily living) and Timed Up and Go. Results: 54 aPD and 52 matched HD patients were studied. Mean age was 74.1 \u00b1 7.5 and 72.7 \u00b1 7.8 years respectively; presence of frailty was similar between both modalities (57.4% on aPD and in 42.3% on HD). Multivariate analyses with p-values derived from a generalised linear model showed that frailty score was the most influential variable in relation to outcomes: SF 12 physical p=0.002; SF 12 mental p=0.03; Barthel p<0.0001; Timed Up and Go p<0.0001. Dialysis modality was the most influential variable in determining the total HADS score (mean aPD 12.6, HD 9.5, p=0.0472) and symptom score (median aPD 17, HD 13.5, p=0.023). Using a propensity score derived from age, gender, frailty and comorbidity scores to compare pairs of participants on aPD and HD, showed that the significantly higher HADS score on aPD (P=0.03) remained but not the symptom score (P=0.37). Probable depression (HADS >8) was also more common in the aPD group ( p=0.0442). Conclusions: Degree of frailty is the major determinant of quality of life and physical function. Dialysis modality has a minor role with probably slightly more depression in the aPD group but this needs confirming in the larger longitudinal study. Both aPD and HD should therefore be discussed as potential modalities leaving choice to individual patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP608 HAEMODIALYSIS IN PATIENTS AGED OVER 80 YEARS"}, {"text": "Ikuto Masakane 1 and E-HOPED Study Group 1 1 Yabuki Hospital, Yamagata, Japan", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP610 DOES DIALYZER MEMBRANE MATERIAL AND PERFORMANCE HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE SURVIVAL OF ELDER DIALYSIS PATIENTS?"}, {"text": "Introduction and Aims: Several recent reports warned that high efficient hemodialysis with polysulfone (PS) membrane occasionally led to the deterioration of nutritional status in elder patients.

Nephrologists often face difficult treatment recommendations for elderly end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients with respect to dialysis versus supportive (non-dialysis) care, given uncertainty around survival benefit and considerable treatment burden. We aimed to define nephrologists' preferences for dialysis recommendation in elderly patients and to assess trade-offs between patient characteristics. Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) of Australasian nephrologists. The DCE design was informed by a ranking exercise of characteristics derived from the literature and a pilot DCE of 30 nephrologists. We assessed the influence of patient characteristics (age, gender, cognition, comorbid burden, life expectancy, current quality of life (QOL), expected QOL change with dialysis, social support, patient and family inclination for dialysis) on nephrologists' preferences for dialysis recommendation. The online DCE consisted of 12 scenarios, each with two elderly patients described in terms of the 10 characteristics. Nephrologists were asked which of the hypothetical patients, they would prefer to recommend dialysis to or whether they would recommend dialysis to neither patient. Respondent sociodemographic characteristics were also collected. Analysis used a random parameters logit model with results as the odds of recommending dialysis over no dialysis.

Roughly one third (34%) were aged between 40-49years, 62% were male and 69% were Caucasian. Nephrologists chose \"neither patient\" for 57% of the scenarios. All patient characteristics other than gender significantly affected the likelihood of dialysis recommendation. Nephrologists were more likely to recommend dialysis to patients with preserved cognition, lower comorbid burden, increased life expectancy and high current QOL. Patient and family inclination for dialysis also favoured dialysis recommendation. Nephrologists were less likely to recommend dialysis with each extra year of age and when dialysis was expected to decrease QOL. Nephrologists aged >65 were almost 12 times more likely to recommend dialysis compared with younger counterparts. Nephrologists were willing to forgo 12 months of patient dialysis survival in order to avoid a substantial decrease in patient QOL with dialysis initiation. Conclusions: Many patient characteristics were considered by nephrologists when recommending dialysis. Nephrologists were much more likely to recommend dialysis to those with normal cognition and those inclined for dialysis, and avoided recommending dialysis when initiation was expected to considerably reduce QOL. These findings highlight the need to systematically and longitudinally evaluate cognition and QOL when contemplating dialysis decisions in elderly patients. Introduction and Aims: Hypertension is very poorly controlled in patients on haemodialysis (HD) and hypertension is predictor of cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. Patients with thrice-weekly HD have higher predialysis weights (PWG) and ultrafiltration rates (UF) on the first compared with subsequent HD of the week. We hypothesized that these variations in PWG and UF are associated with a systematic difference in blood pressure. The aim of this study was to examine mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in HD patients and to assess the relationships between these parameters and PWG and UF. Methods: In this study 402 patients (aged 68.3\u00b113.8 years) on maintained HD (4.73 \u00b15.17 years) were included (232 males, 170 females) in Dalmatian centres in Dalmatia county in Southern Croatia. Blood pressure measurement was undertaken at the first HD session on the beginning of the observed week. For every single observed HD mean arterial pressure (MAP) calculated as ((systolic + 2 diastolic blood pressure)/3) (mmHg) and pulse pressure (PP) computed as (systolic -diastolic blood pressure) (mmHg) predialysis and postdialysis were measured. Therefore, PWG and UF rate were calculated as average value during 4 weeks (12 HD treatments) prior tis study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP610 DOES DIALYZER MEMBRANE MATERIAL AND PERFORMANCE HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE SURVIVAL OF ELDER DIALYSIS PATIENTS?"}, {"text": "Results: These results showed influence of PWG and UF on blood pressure in HD patients.

Methods: The RPV user database extant on January 25th 2012 was linked by patient CHI / NHS number with the UK renal registry and anonymised data extracted for analysis. The extract was restricted to adult patients and included patient demography, deprivation indices, ethnicity, UKRR timeline data and referral time (time between first referral to nephrologist and date of starting RRT), date of beginning RRT, date of first logon to RPV, and measures of patient utilisation of RPV derived from log file analysis as reported elsewhere. Patients with a referral time of <90 days were excluded. RPV users were grouped by the interval between their first logon to RPV and their date of starting RRT, and comparison made between patients that had been users of RPV for at least 90 days before beginning RRT (longer term users) and users that began their use of RPV after starting RRT (late users). Logistic regression and Chi-squared tests were performed using SAS v 9.3. Results: Longer term RPV users were more likely than late users to begin RRT on a home based modalities (Home Haemodialysis or Peritoneal dialysis) than hospital haemodialysis (571/1345 and 543/1453 respectively, p = 0.006). The association was stronger for longer term users that logged into RPV more persistently suggesting the effect was related to the patients themselves rather than any selection by the centre of patients offered RPV (481/1068, p = 0.0001). By 90 days after starting RRT the difference in prevalence of home-based modality provision to longer term and late RPV users had waned but was still significant ( p = 0.037, 0.032 for persistent RPV users). The results were not just a proxy for a longer referral period (so more time to initiate RPV) as a similar pattern was found when patients with referral time <6 months of < 1 year were excluded. Controlling for age, sex, deprivation and ethnicity, longer term persistent RPV users were 31% (10-57%, 95% CI) more likely to begin RRT on a home-based modality than late users, and almost three times more likely than the overall RRT population. Longer term RPV users were more likely to begin RRT with a live transplant compared to late users (217/342 and 150/274 respectively, p = 0.029), even when controlling for age, sex and deprivation, and similarly, this association had weakened by 90 days after starting RRT ( p = 0.22).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction and Aims: Renal Patient View (RPV) is an established Electronic"}, {"text": "The results demonstrate an association between using RPV and beginning RRT on a home-based modality or with a live donor transplant.

Introduction and Aims: Approximately 53,000 patients received renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the UK in 2011, resulting in a substantial economic burden. Evidence suggests that high dose haemodialysis (more frequent and/or longer duration hemodialysis (HD)) may be associated with better health outcomes and can be cost savings in the UK (if conducted at home with the current tariff ) versus conventional in-centre HD (ICHD). However, the current weekly tariff for home dialysis in the UK is not reflecting the increased production costs associated with an increased number of dialysis sessions per week. We investigated the financial impact of increasing the proportion of ESRD patients on home-based dialysis modalities, especially high dose HD at home with increased tariff, from the UK payer perspective.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Methods: A Markov model was constructed reflecting the natural history of dialysis patients; based on this, a budget impact analysis was performed over a 5-year time horizon from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS Introduction and Aims: Low free triiodothyronine (fT3), largely an epiphenomenon of inflammation and protein-energy wasting, is a strong predictor of mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

In 73% of cases the choice of the method was made collaboratively by patient and physician. Although only 17% of respondents integrally assumed the decision, those patients had a better overall satisfaction with the dialysis method(r=0.08; p=0.05), while in patients in whom the choice of the method was made exclusively by physician, a trend to a lower quality of health was reported (r=-0.05; p>0.05).

Introduction and Aims: Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with dialysis, experience a high risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Peritoneal dialysis (PD), and haemodialysis (HD) are considered equally effective as initial dialysis modalities. However,as patient preference, centre experience and comorbidities affect the choice of modality, the prognostic effect of choice of initial dialysis modality needs to be further explored. Our aims were to utilize propensity score to correct for confounding variables when comparing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients treated with PD and HD as initial dialysis modality. Methods: ESRD patients entering the Norwegian Renal Registry for the first time by initiating dialysis in the period from January 2005 to December 2012 were included. Time dependent propensity scores for starting PD were calculated to correct for confounding variables at the time of dialysis initiation. Propensity score adjusted Cox regression models were used to investigate for independent differences in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality between HD and PD. Cases were censored for shift in dialysis modality, renal transplantation or loss to follow-up. Results: Incident ESRD patients entering dialysis in the period counted 3555; mean age 65 \u00b1 15 years, 67.7 % men. PD was the initial dialysis modality in 754 patients (21.2 %). There were regional differences in the use of PD and HD as initial modality ( p<0.001). Clinically, patients treated with PD were older ( p=0.001), had lower body mass index ( p<0.001), higher eGFR ( p=0.003) and higher haemoglobin and albumin levels (both p<0.001). PD patients had less established heart disease ( p=0.008), peripheral vascular disease ( p=0.002) and malignant disease ( p=0.031) and were more likely to be treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( p=0.020). Furthermore, patients initiating PD were more likely to start dialysis in a planned manner ( p<0.001) and were considered more likely to be suited for future transplantation ( p=0.008). Some aetiologies of renal failure were more likely to be treated with a particular dialysis modality ( p<0.001). Median follow-up before death or censoring was 13 months (range 0-92) in HD patients, and 10 months (0-73) in PD patients. PD as initial dialysis modality was not independently associated with altered risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to HD (HR 1.04, 95 % CI 0.86-1.25 and HR 1.10, 95 % CI 0.83-1.44 respectively). Dialysis modality was also neutral concerning 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (PD vs. HD: HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71-1.25 and HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54-1.29).

Parhon\", Iasi, Romania, 2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy \"Gr. T. Popa\", Iasi, Romania Introduction and Aims: Pain and symptoms evaluation are increasingly perceived as important in patients`management in dialysis units and palliative care institutes. There is little experience on using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short-Form (MSAS-SF) in end-stage renal disease population. MSAS-SF is a useful tool that assesses not only the prevalence of symptoms, but also assesses the severity of symptoms experienced by patients. The objectives of this study were: i. to validate the MSAS-SF in a Romanian hemodialysis (HD) population, ii. to assess the prevalence and severity of physical and psychological symptoms of hemodialysis patients using the MSAS-SF, iii. to determine the quality of life of HD patients, including two summary scores: physical component (PCS) and psychological component (MCS). Methods: Seventy hemodialysis patients were recruted for assessing the internal reliability of MSAS-SF. A different group of 102 stable patients (41 males, 61 females, mean age 52.51 \u00b1 12.02), who were treated with hemodialysis three times weekly completed questionnaires on prevalence and severity of symptoms and quality of life. To determine symptoms prevalence and severity for HD patients MSAS-SF was used, while for determing the quality of life, patients completed the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). Cronbach`s alpha reliability test was performed to assess internal consistency of the MSAS-SF. Results: The Cronbach`s alpha reability score for the total number of items of the MSAS-SF was 0.838, while for the subscales of MSAS-SF the reability scores ranged from 0.648 to 0.749. This means that subscales ranged from acceptable to very good. The top three memorial symptoms experienced by hemodialysis patients were lack of energy, followed by pain, and worrying. The most frequently reported physical symptoms included lack of energy (69.6%), pain (68.6%), numbness/tingling in hands/ feet (64.7%), difficulty sleeping (63.7%), dry mouth (61.8%), dizziness (58.8%), problems with sexual interest or activity (52%). The most frequent psychological symptoms included worrying (65.7%), feeling sad (59.8%), feeling nervous (50%), feeling irritable (40.2%). The mean physical component summary (PCS -Quality of Life) score was 51.78 \u00b1 19.21, and the mean mental component summary (MCS -Quality of Life) score was 61.38 \u00b1 16.71. No statistical relationship between biochemical parameters and MSAS-SF and QoL scores was found. Conclusions: These results support the validity of the MSAS-SF in the assessment of patients undergoing hemodialysis. The major concerns in HD patients were the lack of energy, pain caused by symptoms and keep worrying about everything in their life. ) has been developed to estimate a 10-year absolute risk of major osteoporotic fracture among general population; however the evidence in CKD patients has been lacking and the association between the FRAX \u00ae and mortality is unknown. We, therefore, conducted a hospital-based prospective cohort study to evaluate the predictive ability of the FRAX \u00ae for mortality in hemodialysis patients. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-two patients who had been started initiate maintenance hemodialysis from April 2004 to December 2013, 171 men and 81 women, with a mean (\u00b1 SD) age of 67 \u00b1 14 years were studied. The endpoint was defined as all-cause death. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results: During the mean (\u00b1 SD) follow-up period of 3.4 \u00b1 2.7 years, total 61 death were observed. The median (interquartile range) of the FRAX \u00ae for major osteoporotic fracture were 6.9 (4.6 -12.0) % in men and 19.0 (7.6 -33.0) % in women. A significant interaction between the FRAX \u00ae and gender was detected ( p interaction < 0.001); therefore, separate analyses were conducted for men and women. Cumulative survival at the point of 5 years after starting dialysis, in men with the FRAX \u00ae levels above and below the median was 51.9 and 87.9 % and in women was 67.4 and 83.7 %, respectively ( Figure) . Overall, in men, the multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the log-transformed FRAX \u00ae remained as an independent predictor for death after adjusting by confounding variables (Model 2: HR 3.03, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.70). In women, the FRAX \u00ae was not associated with the endpoint (Table) . Conclusions: Among Japanese hemodialysis patients, the FRAX \u00ae levels seem to be a useful procedure to predict for death in men but not in women. Introduction and Aims: The advances in intensive dialysis contributed to re-discuss the issue of pregnancy in dialysis patients. In spite of the renewed interest, and of the improved results, pregnancy is still exceptional on dialysis. Few data are available comparing pregnancy rates on dialysis and after kidney transplantation also with respect to the overall population. Aim of the study was to assess the incidence of live-born babies from mothers on chronic dialysis in Italy, in the new millennium, comparing the results with the overall population and with kidney transplant patients. Interestingly, about half of the mothers had no residual diuresis (and a long dialysis vintage) and one third had immunologic diseases, including SLE and vasculitis, thus suggesting that pregnancy is possible also after a long dialysis follow-up or with \"difficult\" diseases. Preterm delivery was the rule: 19/21 singletons with available data were preterm (33.3% were \"early preterm\", ie <34 gestational weeks). The prevalence of children below the 10th weight percentile (gestational age-adjusted) was high: 33.3%. Three babies died in the first months of life (including one twin). The surviving children had no clinical or developmental problem. The most common therapeutic adjustment was the switch to daily dialysis (and an increase in exchanges in peritoneal dialysis). As expected, comparing the data with 110 pregnancies recorded after kidney graft (about 60% of the Italian grafted population), birth weight was lower on dialysis (1200 vs 2500 g; p<0.01), and gestational age was also lower (30 vs 36 weeks, p<0.01). Incidence of live-born babies was inferred as 0.7-1.1 per 1000 female dialysis patients in childbearing age (age 20-45 years) and 5.5-8.3 per 1000 grafted patients of the same age groups.

This is the first longitudinal study examining levels and factors affecting Caregiver Burden, Quality of Life (QOL) and Emotional Distress in caregivers of Singaporean PD patients. Methods: A cross sectional sample of N = 86 were recruited through outpatient PD clinics in Singapore between 2009-2011. Of the original sample, N = 44 caregivers who were still in care of their PD patients were reassessed 12 months later. Participants completed the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the Lay Care-giving for Adults Receiving Dialysis (LC-GAD).

Logistic (logit) regression analysis was used for creating models for 3 years survival probability estimation. Since patient's baseline creatinine level turned out to be an insignificant parameter for the model ( p>0.05), baseline serum urea and UA levels were selected for independent parameters. Three models were created: two single molecules based and one combined model. The performance of the models was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: During the follow-up 21 patients died and 9 survived. Figure 1 shows that using combined logistic regression models could lead to more accurate results, compared to a single molecule model. It suggests that survival probability may be determined by a set of causal factors. Figure 1 . ROC curves of the created models for estimating dialysis patient's 3 year survival. Models used baseline urea, UA or combination of both for prediction. Conclusions: The main limitation of this study was a small study group. However, by our knowledge this kind of parameter combining approach is unique and has a potential to improve the quality of dialysis, and hopefully also life expectancy of dialysis patients. The future goal is to test created models in a larger independent validation cohort and make adjustments if needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 726, "end": 734, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 946, "end": 954, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Methods:"}]}
