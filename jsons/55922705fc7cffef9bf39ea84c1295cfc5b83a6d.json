            "text": "Research into overcrowding has been hampered by poor definition of what constitutes normal 'crowding' in an ED. The ACEM definition of access block strong because it is patient-centric, independent of ED size, and reflects change in practice over time. It is relatively weak because it is at best a daily rather than real time measure, and severe access block affects the ED for many hours or days afterwards. The best statistical measure of daily workload yet identified is the total daily patient care time, which corresponds to mean occupancy with patients being treated. Research is beginning to examine this measure over shorter time periods, but there are many other factors that impact whether an ED is 'overcrowded' at any particular moment. The incidence of many adverse events is directly correlated with access block and daily workload, reflecting both increased waiting times and excessive demands placed on staff. There is an urgent need for public discussion about resource allocation within the health system and Emergency Physicians need to represent our patients by bringing these matters into the debate. assessment was well documented and validated the decision rule. D-Dimer testing was appropriately reduced with improved specificity. All radiological tests used show improved diagnostic yield. Pulmonary angiography rates doubled although less were indicated. The pathway is well accepted particularly amongst junior staff. Conclusion: This paper will present information on why diagnosis of PE needs to be standardized and successfully implementing this in an evidence based fashion. Data will be presented suggesting multiple areas of process improvement, validation of the clinical scoring rule and less indeterminate outcomes.",

            "text": "Our institution is currently developing a multidisciplinary stroke pathway. There is level A evidence to show the effectiveness of acute stroke units and thrombolysis in the acute management of stroke. Evidence-based consensus guidelines have now been published in Stroke 2003. In this presentation the ongoing development of this pathway will be referenced to this evidence. The focus will be on major issues relevant to Emergency Medicine. Important Emergency Medicine management issues include the following: supportive care, swallowing and administration of IV fluids, hypertension, aspirin administration, thrombolysis, anticoagulation, surgical intervention for raised intracranial pressure, and resuscitation decisions. Assessment issues that will also be focused on include the following: time to diagnosis, accuracy of diagnosis, eligibility for thrombolysis, diagnosing ischaemic stroke from intracranial haemorrhage, differentiating a TIA from a stroke, appropriate investigations, acceptable time to CT, and appropriate threshold for admission. Emergency medicine stroke key performance indicators (KPI's) are not well described, except for the possible exception of thrombolysis. Possible KPI's and their suggested targets in brackets, are indicated below: \u2022 Accuracy of triage status for TL eligible (> 85%) \u2022 Accuracy of triage diagnosis \u2022 Bedside glucose (100%) \u2022 Triage category 2 seen by time compliance (90%) \u2022 Door to CT times in TL (85% AHA compliance) \u2022 Request to urgent CT scan time (90% < 60 min) \u2022 Door to TL times (85% AHA compliance) \u2022 Appropriate vs. inappropriate administration of TL \u2022 Swallowing evaluation performed in ED or patient kept nil orally with IV fluid (100%) \u2022 Hyperglycaemia control \u2022 CXR -inappropriate ordering (< 15% of CVA) \u2022 ECG A model for measuring the casemix activity and economic costs of hospital access block Peter Stuart Aim: To determine the Emergency Department activity and costs resulting from access block. Methods: Using data from four ACEM accredited hospitals the correlation between casemix activity measured using the Urgency and Disposition Group (UDG) model and degree of access block for the period 1998-2002 was determined. The Access Block adjusted Weighted Occasions of Service (AWOOS) model was developed from the UDG casemix system by incorporating two modifying variables to account for the increased length of stay for admitted patients (Length of Stay Factor) and the cost resulting from this increased workload (Access Block Cost Ratio). The difference between the change to UDG and AWOOS activity over the 5-year period was calculated to estimate the activity and costs of access block not measured by the UDG casemix model. Results: Over the five period the combined data showed that the mean length of stay in ED for admitted/transferred patients (LOS) increased by 93% (range 21% to 183%), UDG activity increased by 0.63% (\u22125.6% to 6.1%) and AWOOS activity increased by 24.5% (5.1% to 51.4%). In the three hospitals with the largest increase in LOS, UDG activity showed no correlation with access block. The AWOOS model was highly correlated with access block at all four hospitals (r = 0.84-0.99, P < 0.05). The (unmeasured) activity and costs resulting from access block was 23.9% (range 5.1% to 51.4%). Conclusion: The UDG casemix system significantly underestimates the activity in emergency departments experiencing marked access block. The AWOOS model provides a practical tool for measuring the economic costs and increased ED workload resulting from access block.",

A retrospective analysis of data from EDIS and TOPAS (admitted patient administration system) was undertaken for 2001 and 2002 in the three major tertiary Perth Emergency Departments. Using a multivariate analysis, it was found that: \u2022 Total diversion time is dependent upon percentage of patients subject to access block (r = 0.830, P < 0.001). No other variable was found to be independent of access block. \u2022 Percentage of patients seen within recommended time is dependent upon loss of cubicle space due to access blocked patients (r = 0.840, P < 0.002). Adding total attendances to the model only marginally increases the correlation coefficient (r = 0.844, P < 0.002). \u2022 Total ED occupancy is dependent on loss of cubicle space due to access blocked patients (r = 0.970, P < 0.0002). Adding total attendances to the model only marginally increases the correlation (r = 0.975, P < 0.0002). These data suggest that poor waiting times and ED overcrowding will not be improved by reducing ED attendances. Rather, reducing access block should be the highest priority in allocating resources to reduce ambulance diversion, improve waiting times and reduce ED overcrowding. Efforts at reducing attendances will have minimal impact and should be only considered after access block is controlled.",

Record rates of ambulance bypass and access block have been experienced in major teaching hospitals, and indeed many smaller regional hospitals across Australia. Royal Hobart Hospital, the major teaching hospital for the University of Tasmania, and the tertiary referral centre for Tasmania, has not been immune to such overcrowding issues. The Royal Hobart Hospital is a 450-bed teaching hospital, and has 40 000 new presentations per annum. Towards the end of 2002, access block and elective theatre cancellations threatened to bring the Tasmanian health system to its knees. Royal Hobart Hospital cannot go on bypass so this was not an option. Drastic measures were taken by the CEO and senior clinicians towards the end of 2002, and plans were drawn up to ensure that there were at least 10 free beds in the hospital by COB each day. This paper will describe the results, which show that only three admitted patients have stayed overnight on a trolley in the Emergency Department since October 2002; an exceptional result. Elective cancellations (for lack of beds) is a rarity, and elective surgery throughput is comparable to benchmarked institutions nationwide. This paper will describe the actions taken by the senior executive and clinicians at Royal Hobart Hospital. These actions successfully turned around the ED overcrowding issues and has led to a sustained effects through the Winter of 2003.",

            "text": "Background: Prolonged emergency department length of stay (EDLOS) is endemic in Australasia. This study examined the association between EDLOS and inpatient length of stay (IPLOS) among admitted patients in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Retrospective review was undertaken of emergency department (ED) presentations which required admission at a major metropolitan health service, from 1/7/2000 to 30/6/2001, inclusive. EDLOS was defined as total time of ED stay; IPLOS as time from initiation of treatment in ED to hospital discharge. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between excess IPLOS (IPLOS exceeding state average LOS (SALOS) for the relevant diagnostic-related group) and EDLOS, age, gender and time of ED presentation. Results: 17 954 admissions were included. Mean IPLOS for four EDLOS categories (= 4 h, 4-8 h, 8-12 h and > 12 h) were: 3.73, 5.65, 6.60 and 7.20 days, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding mean values for (IPLOS -SALOS) were 0.39, 1.30, 1.96 and 2.35 days (P < 0.001). Compared to EDLOS 4-8 h, odds ratios (95% CI) for excess IPLOS associated with other EDLOS categories were: = 4 h: 0.68 (0.63-0.74); 8-12 h: 1.20 (1.10-1.30); and > 12 h: 1.49 (1.36-1.63), after adjusting for age, gender and time of ED presentation. Conclusions: EDLOS correlates with IPLOS, and predicts if IPLOS exceeds the state benchmark for the relevant DRG, independently of age, gender and time of ED presentation. Compared to patients with EDLOS of 4-8 h, those staying 8-12 h are approximately 20% more likely to have IPLOS exceeding state average; 50% more likely if EDLOS exceeds 12 h; and 30% less likely if EDLOS is \u00a34 h.",

Methods: Retrospective cohort study in a mixed adult/paediatric tertiary hospital. Records of all patients treated in the ED and subsequently discharged after surgery from the orthopaedic unit in 2001 were reviewed, and other data were obtained from existing ED databases. For each patient the total ED time (TEDT) and the time to surgery from ED arrival to start of operation were calculated. AB was defined as TEDT greater than 8 h and delay to surgery (DTS) was defined as time to surgery greater than 24 h. Daily AB was expressed as a proportion of all admissions. Results: There were 1172 presentations to ED resulting in acute orthopaedic admission of whom 952 had surgery. AB occurred in 183 admissions (19.2%) and was associated with increased DTS (41.5% vs. 36.3%, P = 0.001). LOS for patients with DTS was 1.93 days (95% CI 1.14-2.71) greater than national DRG averages compared to 0.31 days (\u2212 0.38-0.94) for those without DTS.

The use of plaster of paris cast and backslab are both standard practices of management. Fracture outcome is similar in each group, but it unknown which is the preferred method of immobilization of the patient and family. Aims: We aimed to prospectively investigate the difference in parental satisfaction, ease of maintaining the plaster, and pain experienced with these two methods of treatment. Methods: 84 patients, aged 17-year-old-or less, presenting with torus/buckle fracture of the distal radius and ulna were prospectively randomised to management in a below elbow plaster cast or backslab. They were reviewed after 2 weeks of immobilization and followed up by Tel. 2 weeks after plaster removal. Results: Patients in the slab group experienced an average of 7.6 days of pain compared to cast patients with 4.8 days (P = 0.009). Similarly, the slab group experienced worse minor pain (P = 0.006) and lower arm function (P = 0.04) during the first 4 days. However, we found no difference in parental satisfaction, based on ease of plaster care, future use of treatment and comments. There were no complications in outcome. Slab immobilization was associated with better scores for versatility. Conclusion: We concluded that despite use of a slab being associated with increased intensity and duration of pain and reduced arm function while immobilized, both methods of treatment are equally acceptable to parents and patients, and safe to be used.

To determine the impact of implementation of the Canadian C-spine rules on X-ray ordering for alert, adult patients with potential neck injury. 2. To determine whether implementation of the rule reduced time in hard collars for patients with potential neck injury. Methods: Before and after study of all adult patients presenting to the emergency department of Western Hospital with potential neck injuries who were immobilized in hard cervical collars. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, X-ray rate and time in hard collar. Data analysis was by chi square test for proportions and Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. Results: 211 patients were studied. The X-ray ordering rate decreased from 67% to 50% [25% relative reduction, P = 0.0191]. Time in hard collar also reduced from a median of 128 min to a median of 104.5 min [effect size 23.5 mins] but this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Implementation of the Canadian C-spine rule reduced X-ray ordering by 25% and has the potential to reduce uncomfortable time in hard collars for patients.

Methods: Design Prospective, observational study and subsequent modelling. Setting: Twenty hospitals and two ambulance services in Victoria, Australia. Patients: All patients transported to hospital by ambulance who subsequently received intravenous thrombolysis (N = 1147). Interventions: Regression models estimated the association between predictor variables age, gender, route of referral, symptom onset-to-call time, ambulance prenotification of the receiving hospital, emergency department thrombolysis, and the outcome, time-to-thrombolysis. Further modelling estimated the number needed to treat to save one life by several recommended interventions to reduce time delays. Main outcome measures: Components of the overall time to thrombolysis, modelled to estimate expected mortality. Results: Presentation via a rural hospital or general practitioner was associated with an approximate doubling of the onset-to-call time (2.08 and 2.30, respectively). Ambulance-hospital prenotification and emergency department thrombolysis reduced door-to-needle times by 21% and 27%, respectively. Modelling showed that each of the following interventions would be expected to save one life: 1069 hospital prenotifications, 714 cases of emergency department thrombolysis, 184 cases of prehospital thrombolysis, 340 cases to bypass their rural hospital, or 50 cases to bypass their general practitioner. Conclusion: Hospital prenotification and emergency department thrombolysis reduce time delays, although the mortality impact appears to be modest. Pre-hospital thrombolysis has the potential to save lives, although validation in real practice is required. Advising patients to call directly for an ambulance, rather than the general practitioner, has the greatest potential to save lives.",

We postulated that the use of Pocket PC's would reduce documentation time thereby improving efficiencies in management, reducing waiting times and improving benchmarks. The project also examined the ability of the Pocket PC to improve patient care with the use of Clinical Decision Support tools. Study Objectives: This study was designed to assess the impact of Pocket PC's on time spent on documentation as well as on legibility and accuracy of notes. In addition, clinicians were questioned about the value of immediate access to reference data bases. Methods: Pre and post implementation audits were performed to compare the two systems. Clinicians were asked to complete a questionnaire addressing issues of Point-of-Care electronic technology and Clinical Decision Support as provided in this model. Results: Clinical data entry using computerized means in the recording of the Medical History, Examination, Investigations and Management strategies is more accurate and legible. This model is simple to use and time efficient. Concerns regarding flexibility of narrative were raised. Conclusions: Advances in miniaturizing computer technology provide the opportunity to deliver improved legibility and accuracy of medical notes, as well as a useful Clinical Decision Support model. Consists of ETT and EOA combined into one tube A single use device, inserted blindly, devised to provide sufficient ventilation whether the tube is placed in the trachea or oesophagus. Indications: As an alternative to endotracheal intubation in the prehospital and in-hospital setting. An esophageal detector device may also be used to determine which placement. Contraindications: Patients under 16 years of age or under 5 feet tall. Responsive patients with an intact gag reflex. Patients with known esophageal disease. Patients who have ingested caustic substances. Potential complications: Facial/dental trauma. May result in tearing of the cuffs. Blind insertion may lead to broken teeth entering the airway.",

Although often broadly described as clinical or management information, there are really three overlapping categories of data: individual patient related, departmental management information, and support. Changes in information technology are notoriously difficult to predict -the core functionality of ED information systems has not altered in a decade, whilst the internet has invaded every aspect of hospital medicine. Increased decision support and patient data access were widely predicted for many years, but the unifying interface of the internet browser was not, and many EDs still have insufficient desk real estate for their computers. Current technologies such as radiology PACS and medical records scanning will be implemented in from the large to the small centres for economic reasons, with the benefit of improved data availability. Non-sensitive data including educational material, decision support and administrative policies will be available everywhere through intranet and internet. Wireless interfaces and tablet PCs will play a larger role, but adoption is likely to be slow. Bedside data entry only makes sense as part of an integrated electronic medical record, and, despite predictions, this has proven as problematic as voice recognition. Privacy concerns become important once electronic data is transferred between institutions. As the market matures, the trend to commoditization of simple software will continue, as will the pressure on vendors to meet standards for interoperability. With more complex integration, issues of access control will increase.",

Medicine, I suggest, is mostly founded on myth. Many myths ultimately have some basis in truth, but many do not. We should hold onto the truths with a very light grip. Examples of prevalent cardiology myths include: heparin is a very effective therapy in acute coronary syndromes, beta-blockers are well studied in unstable angina, there have been great advancements in thrombolytic therapy since 1988. The most important myth in Emergency Cardiology is that the large trials of apparently ED based therapy directly relate to the patients we see in the Emergency Department every day. The use of Clopidogrel, IIb/IIIa inhibitors and nitroprusside in severe aortic stenosis inhibitors will also be used as examples of myths in Emergency Cardiology.",

However, many of the physical examination pearls taught in medical school have never been properly evaluated. The investigation of the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination has lagged behind that of laboratory tests. This presents a quandary: should all signs not validated in rigorous studies be cast aside, or should those not yet disproved be used and taught? However, studies have shown that up to 88% of diagnoses are established at the conclusion of the history and physical examination. So, what do we know about the accuracy of the clinical examination? Using likelihood ratios, a review of the examination findings in critical emergency medicine diagnoses demonstrates that: \u2022 the 3 classic meningeal signs do not have diagnostic value \u2022 abdominal palpation is unreliable for detecting AAA \u2022 rectal examination is unnecessary if patients are tested for rebound tenderness \u2022 bimanual pelvic examination is unreliable \u2022 no combination of history and examination findings confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia \u2022 blood chemistry testing is required to confirm hypovolaemia \u2022 individual symptoms and signs are not useful to diagnose DVT \u2022 physical findings associated with thoracic aortic dissection are present in < 1/3 of cases Robust scientific conclusions regarding the clinical examination are rarely available to assist the emergency physician.

Apart from the frequent overestimation of the power of investigations to diagnose serious disease in the ED (such as cardiac biomarkers) myths regarding the application of diagnostic tests may also impair appropriate clinical decision making. Phrases such as 'diagnostic certainty' and 'establishing a diagnosis' give the impression a diagnosis can be proven absolutely, which is rarely the case. Despite advances in diagnostic imaging, significant discrepancies still exist between pre and post mortem diagnoses demonstrating that, even in the presence of severe disease, considerable diagnostic uncertainty may still exist. The way in which clinical decisions are made are also the subject of myth. The model analytical physician who makes their decisions on Bayesian principles is mostly myth, with heuristics, biases and pattern recognition more commonly employed in decision making. A lack of information regarding prior probability estimation, broad confidence intervals, and the questionable validity of existing data restricts the usefulness of a Bayesian approach to diagnosis. In addition there is a lack of information regarding test performance across normally encountered ranges, and intrinsic biases in probability estimation all further hinder the potency of this new Bayesian deity. We should not lose faith because of the wounding of our superhero. Whilst we have our limitations, these can be overcome. What we also have in our favour is an amazing range of senses and the capacity to integrate information provided in multiple different formats. The biggest myth of all is that we cannot learn.",

Thrombolysis now exists for ischaemic stroke -but considerable delays occur with getting potential patients reviewed. Study Objectives: Are anterior haemorrhagic strokes associated with ECG arrhythmias more than other stroke types? Do patients with a stroke in the UK attend sooner and receive medical evaluation faster through an Emergency Department (ED) than through a Medical Admissions Unit (MAU)? Methods: Prospective observational study of all patients with acute stroke admitted Addenbrooke's NHS ED and MAU. Data reviewed included patient demographics, ECGs, brain CT/MRI scans, previous and presenting illnesses. Results: 90 patients studied -48 ED, 42 MAU. 70% of patients had abnormal ECG on presentation, new changes in 24%. Most common abnormalities were ischaemic changes (52%), AF (24%) and bundle branch block (14%). Multiple arrhythmias seen in 26%. Follow-up ECGs revealed additional new arrhythmias in 45%. Anterior haemorrhagic strokes were not shown to generate more arrhythmias. ED patients arrived over 6.5 h earlier than MAU patients (median time 1.6 h vs. 8.2 h, P-value < 0.001). Increasing age, previous stroke or ischaemic heart disease not associated with longer delay. No difference in time to medical review from arrival. Conclusions: ECG arrhythmias are common post stroke and dictate intensive monitoring of these patients. Unacceptable delays occurred with the time to arrival for our MAU patients -excluding them from the potential benefits of thrombolysis therapy.",

All patients with acute ischaemic stroke presenting to John Hunter Hospital, NSW, Australia, between 1999 and 2003 were included. Results: There were 669 patients. Time of symptom onset was recorded in 187 (28%) patients. Of these, 132 patients had stroke onset within 3 h. 19/132 patients (14%) who were recorded as presenting within 3 h were allocated a triage category of 1 or 2. Blood glucose was recorded in the ED in only 368 (55%) of patients. Despite this, an elevated acute blood glucose (> 8 mmol/L) still predicted a worse outcome, with a greater chance of being dependent at discharge (chi 2 = 4, P < 0.05). Acute stroke severity, measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, a simple standardized scale, was recorded in 58 (9%) of patients. Conclusion: Time of stroke onset was recorded in just 28% of patients, and only a small proportion were a high triage priority. As treatment is time critical, time of stroke onset should be determined urgently and patients presenting within 3 h should be triage category 2. Our study suggests that this is not current practice in Australian EDs. Furthermore, acute blood glucose and stroke severity, which predict stroke prognosis and response to thrombolysis, need to be part of the routine ED assessment. Major education and practice change are required.",

Methods: A prospective audit of all formal radiological reports delivered to the ED for review from November 2002 and May 2003. This included plain xrays, CT scans and ultrasound reports. Results: Over the seven-month study period, a total of 10916 imaging requests were made from the Emergency Department. Of these 186 reports (1.7%) were considered to have an abnormality not detected prior to the patient's discharge home from ED. The most common abnormalities were 45 upper limb fractures (24.2%), 38 lower limb fractures (20.4%) and 30 chest abnormalities (16.1%). The average time between the imaging procedure and the report review was 6.4 days. Of the 186 patients, 18 (9.7%) returned to the ED for review. Only 4 patients (2.1%) were admitted to hospital. Two patients were admitted under the neurosurgical team with CT brain abnormalities. No patients with limb injuries required admission. Eighteen patients (9.6%) who did not return to the ED had specialist consultation arranged by their local doctors at the time of the report review. Conclusion: Radiological interpretation by ED staff is generally accurate, with most missed diagnoses being suitable for outpatient follow up. Discharge letters to the patient's local doctor for following up of the formal imaging report may decrease the delay in report reviewing time and subsequent follow up.",

Objective: To demonstrate the negative predictive value of a new diagnostic test in excluding pulmonary embolism in a local ED population. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis. All Liatest assays that were ordered from the ED in conjunction with standard PE investigations (either or both V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram) over a 12-month period were reviewed.

Test sensitivity was 98%, specificity 44% and negative predictive value 99%. Conclusion: The Liatest d-dimer assay has proven its high sensitivity and negative predictive value in a local ED population. Accuracy was similar to previously published studies.

Aims: Define the incidence of abnormal cranial CT and any clinical or historical indicators which predict the necessity for CT in poisonings admitted to a tertiary referral hospital ICU. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive study of poisoned patients admitted to ICU with admission or discharge diagnoses of poisoning from 1/1/97 to 1/3/03. 229 patient records were reviewed, 55 were excluded. Data analysed included: type of poisoning, clinical factors, length of stay and outcome. Patients were divided into cranial CT and non-cranial CT groups. Results: Of 174 presentations, CT was performed in 48% (84). CT patients were more likely to present with unrecognized poisoning (40% vs. 6%, P < 0.0001), had lower median GCS (6 vs. 7, P = 0.012), evidence of trauma (6.4% vs. 0%, P = 0.024), greater length of stay (P = 0.03) and higher morbidity and mortality (20% vs. 6%, P = 0.026). 11.9% of CTs were abnormal (acute abnormalities in 4.7%). Acute CT changes were all related to hypoxic brain injury. No CTs required neurosurgical intervention. Pre existing neurological disease was the only factor predicting the likelihood of an abnormal CT (OR 2.7, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Abnormal cranial CT results are uncommon in unconscious poisoning patients and did not necessitate neurosurgical intervention in this study. The ordering of head CT was more common with unrecognized poisoning, focal neurologic signs, previous neurologic disease, and signs of trauma. Prospective evaluation of these may assist in developing guidelines for cranial CT in poisoning. Lignocaine, ethyl chloride and nitrous oxide reduce the pain of IV cannulation -results of a randomised controlled trial Sarah Carr, PA Robinson, S Pearson Methods: RCT in which the cannulators were not blinded to the study agent. Patient asked to mark on Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) both pain of application of pretreatment and pain of cannulation. 291 patients were randomised into one of four groups: IV cannula inserted after either 0.1 mL intradermal lignocaine, ethyl chloride sprayed for 5 s at approx 15 cm distance, Entonox (nitrous oxide/ oxygen 50 : 50) inhaled for 1 minute or no pretreatment. Patients were selected from triage category 3-5, 16 years and older, able to give informed consent and deemed to require an iv cannula as part of their workup/treatment by their attending Doctor. Patients were excluded if possible diagnoses included bowel obstruction or pneumothorax. Data was collected on patient demographics, diagnosis, seniority of cannulator (consultant, registrar, housesurgeon), site of cannulation, iv size & number of attempts. Setting: Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department -an urban level one emergency department. Results: Comparisons of pain scales of the four groups showed that lignocaine was superior in reducing pain of cannulation (P < 0.001) overall, followed by ethyl chloride and entonox being better than no pretreatment (no significant difference between ethyl chloride and entonox). Age & gender of patient, presence of pain precannulation, size of cannula, or seniority of cannulator made no significant difference in VAS scores. Lignocaine was judged to be the most painful pretreatment (median VAS 0.5) followed by ethyl chloride (median 0.1). Entonox and 'No pretreatment' had median pain scores of zero. Conclusions: This RCT has again demonstrated that while intradermal lignocaine can be painful to apply, it significantly reduces the pain score for insertion of iv cannulas. This study proposes that the two agents entonox and ethyl chloride while not as effective as lignocaine in reducing cannulation pain, are significantly better than no pretreatment and are much less painful to apply than lignocaine -thus another option in reducing distress and pain caused by iv cannulation in the emergency department setting.",

Methods: Adult patients, who presented to the ED and required ABGS as part of the usual management, were randomised into two groups. Group one received 0.25 mL 1% lignocaine infiltration 1 minute prior to radial artery ABGS, group two had ABGS performed without LA. Patients rated the procedure on a 10-point verbal pain scale, and the number of attempts required to obtain an arterial sample was recorded. Results: 102 patients were recruited, 54 of whom received LA. The mean pain score for patients receiving LA was 2.3, compared with 2.7 for patients who did not receive LA. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.13). The ABG was successfully obtained on first attempt in 75% of patients receiving LA, compared with 88% in the second group. This difference was also not significant (P = 0.14). Conclusions: Although there is no evidence that LA makes ABG more difficult, we found that LA made no significant difference in the level of pain reported by patients. This study does not support the use of LA in ABGS in ED patients.",

It is not designed as a toxicology reference, however, is widely used by health care professionals. Objectives: To determine how widespread the use of MIMS is as a toxicology reference. To evaluate the quality of poisoning management advice it contains. Methods: Firstly, a survey of 500 consecutive calls to the NSW Poison Information Centre (PIC) was undertaken asking health care workers which toxicology references were consulted prior to calling and which references they would use if the PIC were not available. Secondly, a consensus opinion for poisoning management was obtained for 20 common poisonings determined from the Westmead Hospital Toxicology Database by review of five current toxicology references for contra-indicated treatments, ineffective treatments and specific recommended treatments and antidotes. MIMS poisoning management advice was then compared to the toxicology 'gold standard'. Results: 276 doctors and 222 nurses were surveyed. 22.8% of doctors and 6.7% of nurses consulted MIMS prior to calling the PIC. 26% of doctors and 39% nurses stated they would use the MIMS for poisoning management advice if the PIC were not available. For the 20 drugs assessed, 12 contained inaccurate poisoning management: 2 recommended contra-indicated treatments, 2 recommended ineffective treatments and 10 omitted specific treatments or antidotes. Conclusion: The MIMS is a commonly used toxicology reference. It contains a number of significant inaccuracies pertaining to management of common poisonings presenting to emergency departments and should not be used as a primary reference for poisoning advice.",

Methods: All paracetamol overdoses presenting to Hunter Area Toxicology Service were reviewed. Cases were included if > 2 g had been ingested for deliberate self poisoning. The following data was extracted: (Age, gender, dose, alcohol coingestion, alcohol dependence, history of alcohol abuse, time to N-acetylcysteine administration, decontamination). Outcomes were hepatotoxicity defined as AST/ALT > 1000 IU/L and pH < 7.3. Results: From January 1987 to August 2002, 1764 cases of paracetamol poisoning were included. Of these, 44 [Mean age 33 (SD 17), 41% male] developed hepatotoxicity. Of patients with hepatotoxicity 11% had alcohol dependence compared to 6% of the other 1720 cases without hepatotoxicity which was not significantly different (P = 0.14). There was a significant difference in mean paracetamol dose and time to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration between those with and without hepatotoxicity (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only paracetamol dose ingested [OR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.09 per 1 g] and NAC administration > 16 h after ingestion [OR 44, 95% CI: 9-207] were significant predictors of hepatotoxicity. Multivariate analysis also showed that paracetamol dose and time to NAC were the only significant predictors of pH < 7.3. Conclusion: Chronic alcohol dependence did not cause an increase in the likelihood of developing hepatotoxicity or acidosis following acute paracetamol poisoning. Paracetamol dose and time to treatment with NAC were shown to be the only significant predictors of worse outcome similar to previous studies.",

However, there have been an increasing number of cases reported in adults. Few, if any, of these reports have been published in the emergency medicine literature. A case of CDH is presented in a lady who has respiratory distress, shock and abdominal pain. No history of current or remote trauma was elucidated. Tension pneumothorax was considered as a diagnosis. Urgent needle decompression was not performed. Instead an urgent chest X-ray was ordered. Interpretation of the X-ray was not simplistic but it was felt to show massive mediastinal shift towards the right caused by gas-filled structures on the left. Laparotomy revealed the entire stomach, splenic flexure and spleen were located in the left hemithorax. No organ ischaemia was identified. These were reduced and a large posterior congenital diaphragmatic hernia was noted and repaired. Literature review: A comprehensive search, up to the time of submitting this abstract, revealed a small number of reports of adult CDH mainly in surgical, radiological and respiratory related journals. Particular reference will be made to those reports of emergent life threatening presentations. Conclusion: Presentations of CDH in adults are rare but they may present as undifferentiated emergencies and resuscitation scenarios. Incorrect diagnosis may lead to complications from unnecessary procedures and delayed diagnosis. It is hoped that this presentation will increase the awareness of this condition amongst the emergency medicine community.",

The adequacy of discharge planning from the EMU 2. The incidence of unplanned medical intervention following discharge from the EMU 3. Patient understanding of, and satisfaction with, the care received in the EMU Methods: All patients discharged home from the EMU over a threemonth period from April 2003 were surveyed by telephone or mail using standardized preformatted questionnaires. No identifying patient data was collected, and results were stored on an electronic database for statistical analysis. Results and Conclusions: 700 patients were discharged from the EMU and were eligible for inclusion in the study. Data collection is ongoing with a current response rate of 25%. Of these, 98% received a discharge letter, and 94% received adequate discharge advice. Only 4% felt their stay in the EMU was of no benefit, however, after discharge 50% made unscheduled visits to their GP and 10% were readmitted to hospital. 60% were inaccurate in the assessment of the level of seniority of their treating doctor.

Methods: A prospective, observational study of 300 critically ill patients was undertaken. A data collection form, completed by the accompanying doctor, collected physiological, equipment and invasive line related events. Consequent interventions or adverse outcomes were recorded. Results: 101 patients have been enrolled to date. 74 transports (73%) were associated with a total of 218 unexpected events. 165 events (76%) related to equipment (oxygen saturation probe displacement, ventilator leaks, ECG monitor artifact). 60 events (28%) involved lines (IV and power cord tangles, arterial line becoming caught). 53 events (24%) were related to patient physiology (hypotension, desaturation, inadequate sedation). 175 events (80%) required intervention (repositioning equipment, untangling lines, administering fluid bolus). 11 transports (10%) resulted in adverse outcomes (severe hypotension, inadvertent extubation, raised intracranial pressure). Discussion: A large number of patient transports experienced unexpected events, most of these being equipment related. These events usually required intervention, but infrequently resulted in an adverse patient outcome. Guidelines for the safe intrahospital transport of ED patients needs reconsideration.",

Objectives: To quantify the extent of after hours attendances in a Paediatric ED caused by GP unavailability. Methods: A prospective, cross sectional survey, using a selfadministered questionnaire, of all families presenting to the ED after hours over one week. Demographic and triage data and reasons for presentation were collected. A 'convenience presentation' was identified when all of the following criteria were met: the child was triaged into category 4 or 5, the parent stated the child's complaint was mild, the parent did not have a preference for ED treatment for the presenting condition, the child was not referred by a doctor, the child was resident in the metropolitan area of Sydney, and the child did not suffer from a chronic condition. The data were analysed using SPSS version 11.5. Results: Of 352 eligible families, 182 questionnaires were satisfactorily completed, of which 111 (57%) indicated they attended because their GP was unavailable, even though 172 (95%) had a regular primary care provider. However, only 9% of attendances were identified as convenience presentations. Conclusion: Although the majority of after hours presentations were related to GP unavailability, only a small proportion of presentations could safely be diverted to other providers. ) had primary psychiatric or altered conscious states due to drugs and alcohol as the presenting problem. At least 90 of these 500 frequently presenting patients died during the study period. Conclusion: The majority of the presentations by the heaviest users of an ED in a adult inner-city teaching hospital are not suitable for diversion to General Practice. Attempting diversion of the heaviest repeat ED users to General Practice in this setting may not be successful due to the severity, acuity and nature of casemix of the presentations and would have minimal impact on crowding in similar emergency departments.",

Methods: An additional EP was rostered between 10 : 00 and 18 : 00 h on selected weekdays to provide rapid assessment after patients were triaged. Data was collected prospectively to measure waiting times, lengths of stay and the proportion of patients who did not wait (DNW) for medical assessment. Comparison was made between weekday shifts when a rapid assessment EP was on duty (REAT shifts), and the weekday shifts 10 : 00-18 : 00 with normal ED staffing (non-REAT shifts). Results: A total of 59 REAT shifts and 43 non-REAT shifts were identified during the 5-month period from February to June 2003, during which 5390 patients presented. The number of presentations and the distribution of triage codes were similar between the two groups. During REAT shifts, the average waiting time for triage codes 3 and 4 were significantly shorter (3 and 6 min, respectively) than the non-REAT shifts. For the 2161 patients who were admitted to hospital, the decision to admit was made on average 36 min earlier during REAT shifts compared with non-REAT shifts.

As a result, I have learnt the essence of quality and now have a passion to further its cause. My term was divided into three stages. Firstly, I interviewed a clinician from each specialty to ask their opinion about quality programs in their specialty. I documented their meetings, how useful they were in improving patient care, problems and impedances in implementing quality improvements. I then sought what were the best ways to carry out quality programs and what other health services were doing. This consisted of talking to experts in the field, attending conferences, researching journals and visiting other hospitals. With this information I reached a conclusion as to what our Area needed to improve medical quality programs. We have a long way to go. I presented my findings to our area executives and our quality councils. My recommendations are being considered for approval. My goal is to help emergency departments and other specialties to improve on their quality programs. Thus making a safer environment for the patient and its staff.

Unfortunately introduction of the unit often occurs before the purpose has been established. There is also insufficient attention to establishing and monitoring KPIs.

Sounds like the Emergency Department observation ward of the 21st century, but is this occurring throughout Australasia? The SCGH Emergency Department re opened its observation ward and has changed the way it runs over the last 6 years. Currently \u223c25% of admissions to the observation ward are toxicology admissions. The use of the observation ward as a toxicology treatment centre has reduced patient length of stay, produced closer liaison with psychiatric services, and improved the profile of the poisoned patient in the hospital. This presentation will look at the SCGH experience, discussing suitable cases, strategies and traps.",

Like emergency medicine, intensive care is a young speciality in which clinical practice has been increasingly influenced by research and evidence based medicine, particularly over the last 10 years. Translating research findings into evidence based medical practice is not always straightforward. There are instances where widespread changes in practice, have occurred based on the results of 'landmark' meta-analyses, with the results subsequently contradicted in large prospective randomised trials. In other studies, particularly large, multicentre randomised controlled trials, there is often an appreciable time lag between study design and implementation. Subsequently, there is the possibility that the management protocol assigned to the control arm is not consistent with 'standard practice' at the time the study is completed and results released. The concept of ventilator induced lung injury, steroids in septic shock, ulcer prophylaxis and 'renal dose dopamine' are examples of intensive care practice that have undergone change over the last few years. These areas will be briefly reviewed and the 'chain of evidence' examined.",

Indeed, the very nature of the specialty involves the management of patients with undifferentiated medical conditions for whom targeted investigations are often indicated. In recent decades, the diagnostic testing options available to emergency physicians have expanded considerably and have contributed significantly to the accuracy of discharge diagnoses. Important developments include CT, MRI and ultrasound scanning, rapid bacterial antigen analysis, cardiac troponin assay and on-site blood gas analysis. Whilst the advantages of these tests are obvious, consideration needs to be given to their potential drawbacks. In particular, test validity and repeatability need to be considered in result interpretation, especially the variables of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Also, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that physicians may lose some clinical diagnostic acumen as greater reliance is placed upon diagnostic testing. This may also have financial implications and, in many circumstances, guidelines have been developed that aim to improve the rational ordering of diagnostic tests. The nature and function of the health system generally is changing rapidly with many traditional in-house services are now being 'front-loaded' to emergency departments. Consequently, it may be that emergency departments will assume some responsibility for disease screening as well as diagnosis. This possibility needs to be considered as well.",

A transvaginal USS will identify a developing uterine pregnancy at b-hCG levels of 1000 IU/L or more, although the rare heterotopic pregnancy (intrauterine plus ectopic) in 1 in 15 000-1 in 30 000 necessitates exclusion of free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas in the unstable patient. In the non-pregnant patient, fibroids, tubo-ovarian abscess, ovarian cysts, endometriomata or tumours are visualized; however, laparoscopy remains the diagnostic gold standard. One in five laparotomies for suspected appendicitis are negative (normal appendix), rising to 40% in females or the elderly. USS has a poor negative predictive value, with limited usefulness in RIF pain particularly when the appendix is not visualized. Conversely, CT scanning has excellent sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for appendicitis. Importantly, alternate diagnoses such as colitis or diverticulitis may be seen. There is disagreement over the need if any, for oral, intravenous or even rectal contrast. A negative appendicectomy rate as low as 5% is achievable, although CT has yet to dramatically influence this rate. Finally, non-contrast helical CT scanning (NHCT) achieves better accuracy than the traditional intravenous pyelogram (IVP) in suspected urolithiasis. NHCT is more rapid, avoids contrast reactions such as anaphylactoid or nephrotoxic, visualizes radiolucent stones and picks up alternate diagnoses such as appendicitis, diverticulitis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). USS is less accurate than either at demonstrating a stone or estimating the degree of obstruction, but is non-invasive, and most useful in investigating urolithiasis in pregnancy, or ruling out AAA in the unstable patient.",

Similar cases have been reported in children with medical illnesses and following surgery. Fluid rates and the use of hypotonic fluids have often been cited, however, the apparent inability of these children to excrete a free water load suggests that Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) is acting despite low plasma osmolality. The current recommendations for paediatric maintenance fluid requirements are scarce, and to a large extent based on data from the 1950s on energy requirements in well children. The recommendation for hypotonic saline (0.225% saline) is based on the electrolyte composition of human milk. Clinical signs of dehydration occur at 3-4% and features previously considered to indicate 8% dehydration correlate with 5% dehydration. As a result rehydration volumes may be excessive. In health, ADH secretion is tightly linked to plasma osmolality, however, osmotically independent stimuli of ADH secretion in hospitalized children are common, including extracellular fluid contraction, metabolic stress, nausea and vomiting, pain, and diseases of the respiratory and central nervous systems. Two recent studies we have performed studied electrolyte and ADH during rehydration of children for gastroenteritis. Rehydration with 0.45% saline solution resulted in frequent persistence or development of hyponatraemia, whereas with 0.9% saline solution, most hyponatraemic children corrected, and normonatraemic children remained stable. ADH levels remained elevated in many cases despite hyponatraemia and rehydration. The combination of non-osmotic ADH release, hypotonic fluids and excessive rehydration volumes may account for the rare but catastrophic occurrence of hyponatraemia and cerebral oedema in children receiving intravenous fluids. Rehydration should be undertaken with caution and children should be carefully monitored biochemically. Estimates of dehydration should be consistent with the data supporting more conservative figures. Rehydration fluid should be 0.9% saline with glucose.",

As purely clinically based approaches have been shown to have limitations, additional laboratory tests including white blood cell counts, microbiological cultures and acute phase reactants have been extensively investigated to determine if they increase the accuracy of diagnosis. Serum acute phase reactant concentrations have been found to increase in a wide variety of diseases including infectious and inflammatory disorders. Plasma levels of acute phase reactants have been studied to determine their utility in the diagnosis of disease, determination of aetiology and for possible predictive value of clinical course.

This is despite a century of massive change in healthcare delivery systems, a technology explosion and a revolution in societal values. No single healthcare worker has ownership of the knowledge and skills required to manage a patient presenting with an acute severe illness. Family values and feminization/casualization of the workforce have also made the concept of 'wholistic care', as promulgated by some nursing academics and general practice organizations a noble but misguided concept. Whole cadres of doctors and nurses have been trained for jobs that don't exist -this is reflected in the low morale and high fall out rate in recent graduates. Solutions: 1. Acknowledge that there is a limit to the number of people willing to undertake training in healthcare skills (esp. traditional nursing). Delegate low skilled/repetitive tasks to others. 2. Utilize various skill levels of workers in the community and pay accordingly. Create a flexible workforce. Use technicians and volunteers. Possibly commence generic degrees in healthcare with subsequent specialization -doctor/nurse/pharmacist, etc. 3. Build up team models for patient care that work and train workers in team management. No worker 'owns' the patient. 4. Utilize existing institutional resources to 'umbrella' community integration of services. 5. Change funding to reflect desired outcomes. Fee -for -service and case mix payments encourage 'useless' activity and procedural skills at the expense of 'carers'. 6. Coordinate funding streams (esp state/federal).

Relevant factors include the wide variation across Australasia of the scope of ED work, departmental casemix, existing staffing, clinical and operational policies, and degree of bed access block. The lack of a practical and reproducible measure of ED case complexity has also made it very difficult to base a staffing formula on a realistic measure of workload. It is proposed that a measure of complexity be developed through collaboration, including measures of diagnostic complexity and staff intensity as well as urgency. The discussion will then progress to the development of alternative workpractice models for EDs, and the principles of workpractice review. Principles include task re-allocation or deletion, creative use of ancillary staff and communications technology, and re-design of clinical roles.

Once site and access selection has been made, choices of layout are limited. Ensuring adequate space allocation for the department is critical. Frequently regional health services underestimate the space requirements and attempt to use calculations based on mean levels of ED activity, rather than higher percentiles. Not surprisingly, these cause the ED to be inadequate for the demand approximately 50% of the time. A quick illustrative history of the recent development of emergency medicine may be helpful in establishing an adequate allocation of space. Storage space, office numbers and design of communication systems are areas of design that are often troublesome. The redevelopment of an entire department is a different type of change to the incremental changes that usually occur in the ED workplace. From a staff member's perspective, moving Department is not optional, occurs at a time outside of their control, and involves simultaneous change to virtually all tasks normally performed. Change of this magnitude requires significant resources to effect, and this is commonly overlooked when the redevelopment is planned.

However, an acrimonious divorce saw medicine label the old ethics 'paternalism', and then run off with the youthful 'respect for autonomy'. Whereas the old ethics was somewhat ill defined and largely internalized, the new ethics is made explicit in laws and codes of practice. Unfortunately the new relationship is somewhat superficial with little exercising of the heart or mind, and consequently there remains a certain yearning for the moral fulfilment of old. This shift of weight from an internal morality to an external morality is leading us to a moral wasteland. Now, more than before, patients are clients for whom we provide a service. We come to understand them and their context no more thoroughly than a plumber might, and trust is based on a contract rather than a relationship. Emergency Medicine has struggled to accommodate respect for autonomy due to confounders such as urgency and impaired patient competence. In this struggle we have considered ways of respecting autonomy, other than simply providing information and asking what the patient wants. In so doing we have discovered the true ethics, which is neither physician based, nor patient based, but is based on the bit in between.",

Minor problems exposed in the existing disaster plan included a poorly located control room, inadequate relatives facilities, and lack of credentialing process for volunteers. From an ED perspective, triage was best performed by experienced nurses, and overflow areas needed to be better identified.

Results: Within 2 weeks of the first staff becoming affected, 138 hospital cases were reported, the hospital was closed and spread to the community had become apparent. Clinical features of SARS (esp. respiratory symptoms) required by the WHO definition were not prominent, with fever, chills, myalgia, abdominal pain and malaise being the only defining features. The typical course of the illness was over 2 weeks with 20 30% of patients requiring ICU for respiratory failure and 15-20% of patients dying. Infection control procedures were based on droplet spread of the virus. The economic and political impact of this disease was immediately apparent. Conclusion: This was a rapidly evolving epidemic, that had a profound impact on the world over a 3-month period. It now appears to have disappeared however, the lessons learnt from this epidemic are important for emergency medicine.",

Attempts to halt the fulminant course of endotoxin-mediated cardiovascular collapse have included the use of haemostatic therapy (fresh frozen plasma, antithrombin-III concentrate), heparin, endotoxin-blocking agents such as rBPI21, and activated protein-C. Disappointing results in some trials may reflect delayed drug administration after arrival in the intensive care unit, long after the peak in inflammatory mediator activation. The key to improving survival is likely to remain prompt antibiotic therapy before the inflammatory activation takes hold, however, early clinical recognition is notoriously difficult. Typical features of meningococcal sepsis include agitation, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, abdominal pain, tachycardia, and peripheral circulatory compromise. Purpuric rash is usually a late sign. Widely available laboratory tests (toxic blood film changes, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated CRP, and mild coagulation abnormalities including elevated D-Dimer) may give a clue to the presence of meningococcal disease. PCR identification of bacterial DNA is expensive and not normally available outside daytime working hours. Serum procalcitonin has been investigated during a sustained outbreak in New Zealand and shows promise as a rapid screening tool. Careful clinical assessment, observation, investigation (blood cultures and PCR), and a low threshold for empirical antibiotic therapy remain the safest approach to dealing with suspected meningococcal disease. However, this approach has significant resource implications when a concurrent influenza outbreak, media hype, and community panic cause ED presentations to increase by 50% or more, and may require a coordinated hospital response.",

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 82 adult patients who presented to our Emergency Department after a syncopal event. Each had a troponin T level taken at least 4 h after the event. Relevant history of the syncope, background medical history and ECG were collected at presentation. Patients were followed up via Tel. 3-6 months later to ascertain further history of adverse cardiac outcome. The reviewers then examined each medical record and based on this and the follow-up information grouped all the patients according to the cause of their syncope, following the American College of Physicians' guidelines 1997(1). The data collected was then analysed with the aid of a statistician for the predictive value of troponin T in syncope. Results: Of our 82 patients, 36 were male and 46 were female. The age distribution was from 20 to 90 in years. Approximately 25% were felt to have a cardiac cause for their syncope, which is consistent with previous studies. Of the 82 cases, only 2 had positive troponin T levels.

Arrhythmia after TCA overdose is attributed to sodium channel blockade, manifested as QRS prolongation. Recent evidence shows that angiotensin-II acts as a modulator of arrhythmia in rats. Development of QRS prolongation took longer in rats preloaded with captopril during an infusion of desmethylimipramine compared to rats without captopril. How angiotensin-II affects desmethylimipramine induced cardiotoxicity is not well understood. Angiotensin-II increases coupling of ionic currents and regulates other potential modulators such as sodium, intracellular calcium and has been implicated in facilitating noradrenaline release. Pretreating rats with captopril, thus inhibiting angiotensin-II production, demonstrated no significant QRS prolongation after 30 min of desmethylimipramine infusion. Captopril may prevent cardiotoxicity by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. No studies have addressed whether TCA activate the renin-angiotensin system. The purpose of this study was to see if TCA infusions cause an increase in renin production. Methods: Rats were administered an infusion of desmethylimipramine and compared with a control group and a sham group. Renin measurements were obtained at 0, 30 and 60 min QRS, renin levels, blood pressure, and heart rate were compared. Results: QRS duration increased with the desmethylimipramine infusion in the experimental group, while QRS duration remained unchanged in the other groups. Renin levels increased in all groups compared to baseline but there was no significant difference across groups except at 30 min where the sham group was higher. Conclusions: Desmethylimipramine does not appear to cause an increase in renin levels.",

Aims: To determine trainee and fellow experience and perceived proficiency in 23 procedures, participation in accredited training courses, and support for a procedural logbook. Methods: A cross-sectional mail survey of ACEM fellows and Advanced/Provisional trainees was performed. Results: 202 fellows and 264 trainees responded (overall response rate 39%). Considerable variation in procedural experience existed within and between fellow and trainee groups e.g. central cannulation (range: fellows 5-1000, trainees 0-1000), bladder aspiration (0-1000, 0-100), intubation (5-2000, 0-1000). For most procedures, perceived proficiency varied from very poor to very good. However, both groups generally reported poor proficiency for FAST, DPL and Sengstaken tubes. Trainees generally reported poor proficiency with Donway splints and intraosseous needles. Level of experience and proficiency generally increased with seniority. Limited experience generally correlated with less perceived proficiency. Perceived experience (number of procedures) required for proficiency varied considerably within and between both groups e.g. intubation (fellows 5-300, trainees 2-500). There were wide ranges especially within the trainee group e.g. central cannulation (2-100), intercostal catheter (1-100). Both groups showed similar participation for EMST (65%) and APLS (47%) courses. However, more fellows had taken a FAST course (49% vs. 25%) but fewer had ACLS accreditation (16% vs. 23%). The majority of trainees (59%) and fellows (75%) supported a procedural logbook. Conclusion: Procedural experience, perceived proficiency and perceived experience required varied widely.

Our Emergency Department was chronically unable to meet those performance targets. Objectives: Our objectives were to analyse the factors that contributed to access block from our Emergency Department, to institute a program to reduce access block using a multifaceted approach and to assess the impact of that program. Methods The setting is a tertiary-level department treating patients of all ages. Statistical records were examined to identify factors that correlated with periods of access block. Paediatric figures were excluded because access block for paediatric patients was a minor problem. A program was then introduced that included streamlined processes in the Emergency Department and in the wards to facilitate admissions. Performance figures were then analysed to assess the effectiveness of the program and to identify factors that remained barriers to admission. Results: Initial analysis revealed no factor that strongly correlated with access block. It was concluded that multiple areas had to be addressed. After introduction of our program we were able to demonstrate marked improvement in performance. The number of adult inpatient beds available at 0900 h each day now strongly correlates with access block figures and can be used to predict daily problems and to initiate steps to relieve those problems. Conclusion Access block can be reduced by improvement in departmental and hospital procedures but bed availability remains the underlying factor that slows admission.",

A search of the Emergency Department database (HAS solutions) revealed a list of the 20 most common orthopaedic injuries seen over a 5-year period in children aged from zero to 16 years. Using this information as a base, a teaching module was formulated incorporating these 20 common fractures/injuries. In addition, we also included low incidence/high clinical impact such as slipped upper femoral epiphysis. The module was designed to be incorporated into resident and registrar orientation programmes, which would be completed prior to working in the paediatric Emergency Department. The teaching module consists of a pretest, an interactive teaching module and a post-test. The pre-and posttest involve the subject identifying and describing a series of both common and less common orthopaedic injuries and conditions in children. The learning module takes the subject through a step-bystep guide to fracture identification and description using Xrays, line drawings and text. The same set of Xray images is used for the pretest and the post-test. Subjects were randomised into two groups. The study group completed the pretest, the training module and the post-test. The control group completed the pre-and post-tests alone without the training module. Statistical analysisof the pre-and posttest scores was completed and comparison of the study and control groups was made. Results: To be advised. weeks (1 semester) in the department where they are mentored by a registrar. Students are supplied with a workbook which guides but does not limit their experience.

Weekly round table meetings are held where students discuss patients and scenarios, and receive training in the management of resuscitation and common emergency conditions. Study Objectives: To ascertain the effectiveness of the program and its acceptance by students, and whether participation in the program created a favourable impression of emergency medicine as a specialty.

Summary: A prospective, single blinded study was performed on a convenience sample of adult patients requiring procedural sedation. Patients had standard monitoring and procedural sedation as determined by the treating doctor. Treating staff were blinded to BIS values. Serial readings of BIS values were recorded along with OAAS scores. Upon recovery, patients were asked about recall of events while they were sedated. Twelve patients (7 male) were enrolled. The mean age was 58 years (range 20-94). There were 110 paired readings. There was little difficulty with the use of the monitor in the ED. There was no correlation between OASS and BIS values (r = 0.115). Subgroup analysis of the propofol group resulted in a strong correlation (r = 0.92, P < 0.01). There was no suggestion of recall after the procedure. BIS monitoring is feasible in the ED. However, there was poor correlation between BIS values and OASS. Further studies and developments in brain monitoring technology are needed before this form of monitoring becomes clinically useful.

Medical practice on ISS is characterized by a paucity of resources and expertise, and is complicated by the physiological and logistical difficulties inherent to the microgravity ('zero-g') environment. Unlike many terrestrial equivalents, however, ISS has a high-end ultrasound scanner (Philips/ATL HDI5000). Study Objectives: This project is designed to maximize the clinically useful output of the scanner for a range of emergency conditions under the following constraints: lack of trained operators, lack of continuous Earth communications, paucity of management options. Methods: NASA's Patient Condition Database (PCDB), l; ist of all medical conditions likely to be encountered on orbit, was reviewed to identify those conditions which are both likely, and for which ultrasound is useful. From a list of 157 alternatives, four were chosen as highest priority: renal colic, abdominothoracic trauma, ocular trauma and deep vein thrombosis. Abdominothoracic trauma was subclassified as intra-abdominal bleeding, penetrating chest injury and pneumothorax. Results: Using a checklist-based approach, ultrasound scanning protocols for renal colic, blunt abdominothoracic injury, ocular trauma and deep vein thrombosis have been developed. These are specifically designed to allow the untrained practitioner to produce clinically useful results. In February 2004, these protocols will be flown, using porcine models of injury, to determine their efficacy in the microgravity environment. Conclusion: This work will yield a higher level of management confidence than currently possible during medical contingencies on ISS.",

Elizabeth Jacobson, Latha G Stead, Amy L Weaver, Wyatt W Decker Objective: To determine whether the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level is associated with mortality in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: A retrospective review of 206 consecutive patients presenting between December 15, 2001 and June 30, 2002 to the Saint Marys Hospital Emergency Department for AIS was conducted. Data on initial serum ESR (within 48 h of presentation), and dates of death and last follow-up were abstracted. All consecutive patients in the mentioned time period were captured; there were no missing charts. Patient survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were compared using the logrank test. Results: Among the 206 patients, 107 had a serum ESR drawn within 48 h of emergency department presentation. Of these 107, 24 (22%) had an elevated serum ESR, defined as > 29 mm in 1 h. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated survival for those with an elevated serum ESR at 90 and 183 days was 60.6% and 49.6%, respectively, compared to 94.6% and 91% for those with a normal serum ESR. There was a statistically significant association between an elevated serum ESR and overall survival (logrank test; P < 0.001). Conclusion: An elevated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the first 48 h after AIS is associated with poorer survival. . For the safety study, there were 110 subjects. There were no cases of respiratory depression [95% CI 0-4%] and 2 minor allergic reactions. Three patients had a fall in systolic blood pressure to between 80 and 90 mmHg, of whom two required no intervention.

Anne-Maree Kelly, Luke Bradshaw, Debra Kerr Objective: This study aimed to determine the interrater agreement between doctors and nurses for eligibility for application of the Canadian C-Spine rule (CCR) and assessment of the criteria of the CCR. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in an adult community emergency department. Data collected included independent assessments by doctors and nurses of eligibility for application of the CCR, agreement on each criterion of the CCR and overall agreement regarding interpretation of the rule. The outcomes of interest were the interrater agreement between nurse and doctor regarding eligibility for application of the rule and for assessment of each component of the rule, assessed by weighted kappa analysis. Results: 88 cases were eligible for analysis. Doctors and nurses agreed on which patients were eligible to have the CCR applied to them in 96.6% of cases. Inter-rater agreement for most of the criteria of the CCR was good (kappa statistics > 0.69) with the exceptions of the assessment of midline tenderness [kappa 0.58] and range of motion that most nurses did not test. The kappa statistic for agreement between doctors and nurses for interpretation of the rule in individual patients was 0.69. Doctors would have cleared 35% of cases using the rule while nurses would have cleared 25% [P < 0.001]. Conclusion: Nurses can reliably apply most of the criteria of the CCR but are uncomfortable assessing range of movement. With further education and support, nurses should be apply to safely apply the CCR.",

Arian Lasocki, Drew Richardson, Howard Galloway Aims: To determine the number of patients in the last 3 years who had an urgent laparotomy (within 6 h of presentation) following an abdominal CT scan demonstrating free fluid. This will help identify the potential role for FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma) in blunt abdominal trauma at our hospital. Method: This is a retrospective descriptive study of abdominal CT scans performed from 2000 until 2002 following patients presenting to a tertiary mixed adult/paediatric emergency department with suspected blunt abdominal trauma. Computer records were reviewed on all emergency department patients recorded in the imaging database as having an abdominal CT during this 3-year period. Results: 662 CT scans were performed, of which 648 (97.9%) had reports. 141 (21.8%) scans were positive for intra-abdominal and/or intrapelvic fluid. 25 patients had urgent laparotomies, of which only 40% had a large amount of fluid on CT. Sensitivity of free fluid on CT scan as a predictor for the need for urgent laparotomy was 96.0%, and specificity was 81.1%. Positive predictive value was 16.9%. The most common organ injuries at laparotomy were small bowel and spleen. Conclusions: FAST has the potential to play an important role in the management of about two patients every three months presenting to this hospital. However, this is likely a substantial overestimate because of FAST's inherent lower sensitivity in identifying free fluid. In our hospital therefore FAST should not replace CT, but rather be a useful adjunct in a small proportion of trauma patients.",

Methods: The Department of Emergency Medicine at an academic medical centre provides flight consultations to a major United States based international airline (10% of U.S. passengers). Consults were collected into a database that contains 2425 calls, representing > 4 million flights flown from 1995 to 2002 (5.2% were international departures). This is an observational retrospective review of the database. The database was queried for all passengers between the ages of 0-18 years from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002. Results: 222 paediatric consults were identified, representing one paediatric call per 20 775 flights. The mean age was 6.8 years. 51 emergencies were preflight calls and 171 were in-flight paediatric consults. The most common in-flight consults were Infectious (27%), Neurologic (14.6%), and Respiratory (12.8%) emergencies. Nineteen flights (11.1%) were diverted (1 per 240 000 flights), most commonly due to Neurologic and Respiratory emergencies. There were 53 emergency consults (31% of in-flight consults) and 6 diversions (32% of diversions) from international flights. International flights had a higher incidence of consults and diversions for paediatric emergencies than did domestic flights (P < 0.0001).",

Methods: A multidisciplinary group consisting of medical, nursing, pharmacy, aged care and physiotherapy staff developed a comprehensive program to improve acute pain management. This included reintroduction of a nurse initiated analgesia program enabling nurses to initiate a variety of analgesics in accordance with a detailed algorithm, patient developed posters to encourage greater patient participation in their pain management and improved availability of non-pharmacological measures. Pre and post intervention, patient satisfaction using the American Pain Society's questionnaire and the time to achieve adequate analgesia (pain score < 4) were measured for 50 consecutive patients identified by the ED pharmacist with a pain score at triage of 5 or greater. Results: Time to achieve adequate pain control was reduced from 3.8 h to 2.3 h (P = 0.0034), largely due to improved titration of analgesics. Most patients required more than one dose of analgesic to achieve adequate pain relief. Patients reporting that they were satisfied/very satisfied with their pain management increased from 64% to 89%. Conclusions: A comprehensive approach to acute pain management in ED has yielded significant improvements. This evaluation process has been found to be more valuable than solely determining time to first dose of analgesia, as it measures the adequacy of analgesic titration and the role of non-pharmacological measures.",

Our hypothesis was that early administration of bolus thrombolysis could lead to improved survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: A prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. All victims of out of hospital cardiac arrest brought to the emergency department (ED) by the emergency medical system were eligible for inclusion. All patients received standard advanced cardiac life support, except that the first drug the patient received was either tenecteplase 50 mg or placebo. The primary end point was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). 95% CI 11-61%). Two tenecteplase and one placebo patient survived to leave ED, and one in each group survived to hospital discharge. Autopsy results were available on 8 patients, 5 of whom had a thrombotic cause of death. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we found the use of early bolus tenecteplase for OHCA to be feasible, and that it appears to increase the rate of ROSC. Larger studies are required to determine if this translates into a survival benefit. Appropriate patient selection for OHCA studies remains problematic. Matched arterial and venous blood gas samples taken from a convenience sample of patients who presented to the ED with COAD deemed by their treating doctor to require arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis as part of their care. The screening cut-off was defined as a venous pCO 2 of 45 mmHg or more and arterial hypercarbia was defined at arterial pCO 2 of more than 50 mmHg. Analysis was by descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value analysis. Assuming the ABG was performed to assess hypercarbia, 30% of ABG could have potentially been avoided if a venous screening test was employed. Conclusion: Venous pCO 2 can be used as a screening test for arterial hypercarbia, and if employed, can potentially reduce the requirement for ABG sampling.",

Methods: A prospective observational study of adult patients requiring urgent cranial CT in the absence of trauma, between July 2002 and January 2003. Patient selection was on an individual clinical basis by the treating ED physician or registrar. Data collected prior to the scan was assessed to determine the presence or absence of Rothrock and Harris criteria.

Further support by emergency physicians, particularly from Australasia, will be required.Poster Board: 15 A pilot trial of BIS monitoring for procedural sedation in the emergency department Daniel Fatovich, Monica Gope, Michael J Paech Introduction: There is no objective physiologic parameter available to monitor a patient & #8217; s conscious state. In anaesthesia, BiSpectral (BIS) index monitoring has been validated as an objective measure of depth of anaesthesia and perhaps to prevent awareness. Our aims were to 1. Determine if BIS monitoring is feasible in the ED 2. Compare BIS values with the Observer & #8217; s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OASS) 3. Determine patients & #8217; recall of events following sedation.",

For patients receiving nurse-initiated narcotic analgesia [NINA], to determine the safety of NINA. 2. For patients with wrist fractures or renal/biliary colic, to determine the impact of NINA on time to analgesia and time to pain control. Methods: Prospective, explicit medical record review. For the safety study, we included all patients receiving NINA. For the time study, the subjects were all patients with a suspected wrist fracture or renal/biliary colic. Data collected included demographics, condition, analgesia administration, time from arrival to initiation of analgesia, time from arrival to pain control (defined as reporting a pain score \u00a33) and adverse events. Results: For patients with wrist fractures and renal/biliary colic, there were 72 patients in the NINA group and 129 patients in the non-NINA group. Median time to first dose of analgesia was 25.5 mins [NINA group] compared with 59 mins [non-NINA group] [effect size 33.5 mins, 95% CI 22-42 mins]. Median time to pain score \u00a33 was 103.5 mins [NINA] compared with 130 mins [non-NINA] [effect size 26.5 mins, 95% CI 1-68 mins]",

Objective: We analysed significant acute injury and chronic disability resulting from surfboard riding over a 12-month period. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of surfers at eight Victorian beaches between February and May 2003, utilizing a researcheradministrated questionnaire. Significant injuries were those that required medical attention or time off surfing/work. Results: 646 surfers enrolled (90.3% male, median age 27 years, median years surfing 10). 146 surfers sustained a total of 168 acute injuries in the preceding 12 months (0.26 injuries/surfer/year). Most were caused by striking the surfboard or another surfer (45.2%), 'wiping out' (36.3%) or striking the seabed (17.9%). Injuries included lacerations (46.4%), sprains (28.6%), dislocations (10.7%) and fractures (8.9%). Injured parts included the head/face (26.2%), foot/ankle (17.9%), leg (14.3%) and knee/patella (13.7%)",

Videotape has been used to evaluate resuscitations. Can it help us manage trauma better? Aims: To investigate the utility of videotaping in identifying treatment errors made by the trauma team in the resuscitation of injured children. To determine if any of these treatment errors lead to adverse outcomes for the children. To asses the need to develop a teaching package to correct the frequent errors. Methods: All children who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of the Royal Children's Hospital, between 19 February 2001 and 18 August 2002, for whom the trauma team was activated, were to be videotaped. The ED staff started the videotaping via a remote activation switch. Resuscitation was measured against EMST/APLS guidelines. Deviations from these guidelines were classed as management errors. Results: 90 videotaped trauma resuscitations were reviewed. Trauma team personnel present within 15 min of the patient: general surgery -55%; neurosurgery -70%; and radiographer -60%. There were on average 3.5 management errors per patient, these were fewer in the more seriously injured (ISS > 11). History review adds to videotape analysis but detected only 30% of errors. No causative effect for adverse events found could be established. Conclusions: Videotape review should be an integral part of resuscitation review and the problems of confidentiality can be overcome.",

Benjamin Peake, Latha G Stead, Amy L Weaver, Wyatt W Decker Objective: To determine whether an initial elevated white blood cell count in the emergency department (ED) correlates with mortality in transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: The records of all 72 patients with a final diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (ICD-9 code 435) presenting to the Saint Marys Hospital Emergency Department in a six month period was performed. Data on ED complete blood count values, and dates of death and last follow-up were abstracted. All consecutive patients in the mentioned time period were captured; there were no missing charts. Associations with survival were evaluated based on fitting univariate Cox proportional hazards models and summarized by calculating risk ratios (RR, risk per a 10 unit decrease) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). This study was approved by the authors' institutional review board. Results: Of the 72 patients, 69 had laboratory analysis performed in the ED. A total of 7 patients had an elevated white blood cell count defined as > 10.5 \u00d7 109/L. Among these 7 patients with leukocytosis there were 3 deaths at 17, 377, and 431 days. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated survival at 6 months was 80.0%. Among the 62 patients without leukocytosis there were 5 deaths at 17, 61, 145, 201, and 321 days; the estimated survival at 6 months was 94.5%. There was a statistically significant association between leukocytosis and overall survival (logrank test; P = 0.003). Conclusion: An initial elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) in the ED appears to be associated with poorer survival in TIA.",

            "text": "Objective: This study aimed to identify how the recently reported increased average ward length of stay (LOS) in AB patients is confounded by patient age in a diagnostic subgroup identified in the ED. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive study of all patients admitted through ED to an inpatient bed in a tertiary hospital with a recorded ED diagnosis of obstructive airways disease (including asthma) (ICD10 J40.0-J45.9) or pneumonia (ICD10 J12.0-J18.9) in 2000-01. Standard definitions were used: LOS = days from admission to discharge, or 1 if on same day, Access Block = Time from ED arrival to admission more than 8 h. LOS was described as 'long' if more than 4 days or 'short' otherwise. Results: LOS was longer in AB patients for both diagnoses (Asthma: 4.65 vs. 3.82, n = 887, P = 0.05, Pneumonia: 6.78 vs. 5.46, n = 710, P = 0.02). However, both LOS and rate of AB were correlated with age, and there was no significant difference between LOS with and without AB in each age group (95% CI):Conclusions: In this sample, the access block effect on LOS is caused by the confounding effect of age on rates of AB and LOS. Recorded ED diagnosis is not an appropriate means of controlling for casemix in a mixed age population. Future studies of LOS for ED patients should use validated inpatient casemix measures to account for age related variations.",

Objectives: To identify factors predictive of prolonged disability following whiplash injury. Introduction: Whilst subjects with whiplash associated disorders lack demonstrable physical injury, a significant percentage exhibit prolonged disability. Moreover disability is unrelated to the severity of the collision, measured in terms of vehicle damage. It has been proposed that psychological factors and litigation are mainly responsible for prolonged disability. Methods: 147 subjects with whiplash were recruited within one month of the accident and interviewed for putative risk factors for disability, including physical and mental wellbeing assessed with the SF-36 Health Questionnaire. Of these subjects, 135 were reinterviewed one year after the accident, and recovery was assessed by five outcomes -increase in 'neck pain outcome score' (NPOS), improvement in visual analogue pain score (VAPS), return to work, no longer having treatment and settlement of claim. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken to measure the association between putative risk factors and measures of outcome. Results: The bodily pain score and role emotional scores of the SF-36 health questionnaire showed a consistent significant positive association with better outcomes.
