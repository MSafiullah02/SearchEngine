This will be realised by considering infection from an ecological perspective; that is, the world is a changing and dynamic community of organisms, of which humans are only a very small part. It is this aspect that makes treating infectious diseases so challenging, because infections are the result of an interaction between two organisms, both of which are evolving to exploit or reject the other. Consequently, the relationship is ever changing and dynamic; in the case of humans, this is most notably being seen in the development of immunity throughout the lifespan.",

It is estimated that there are around 4\u20136 \u00d7 1030 prokaryotes in the world (these are non-nucleated organsisms and comprise bacteria and archea), in contrast to the approximately 7.7 \u00d7 109 (7.7 billion) humans (Whitman et al. 1998). Fortunately, very few microorganisms cause disease; it has been estimated that there are in the region 1407 pathogenic species of organism, of which bacteria comprise 538, fungi 307, helminths 287, viruses 208, and protozoa 57 (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005). Although this estimate is somewhat elderly and probably underestimates this number, even doubling this would still represent a small proportion of the total number of organisms. Some of these, around 816, are shared with animals, known as zoonoses; and around 13% are new or re-emerging pathogens. Recently, emerged diseases include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), while other infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and influenza continue to circulate and in the case of influenza to evolve and change at a rapid rate.",

This is in contrast with mutual relationships where both benefit, or parasitic ones where one benefits but damages the other. Some parts of the body have a large number of organisms, while others are normally sterile, examples of the latter being most internal organs, bones and the blood and central nervous system. If microorganisms do infect these normally sterile sites, the resulting infection is known as an invasive infection. Because this means that microorganisms have gained access to a normally sterile site, such infections are often associated with injury or serious disease. Many of the most serious infections such as meningitis, septicaemia and osteomyelitis are invasive infections.",

Maintenance of a healthy and balanced flora is important for this and other reasons, for example, it is thought that it helps to regulate the immune system and reduce the risk of allergy (Belkaid and Hand 2014). In addition to not using antibiotics unnecessarily, other factors such as diet may be important, this being the rationale for the use of pre- and probiotics; prebiotics being non-digestible substances that encourage a healthy flora, while probiotics are the organisms themselves (sometimes referred to in advertising as \u2018friendly\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 bacteria).",

Some drugs, such as the newer penicillins, are semi-synthetic, which means that they have a natural base that has been altered synthetically. In practice this makes very little difference, but it does have implications for the development of resistance, as it means that some resistance genes are found in the producing organism or the environment; for example, a bacterium producing an antibacterial substance must itself be resistant to the substance it is producing if it is not to kill itself. From a resistance perspective, this becomes problematic if these resistance genes spread into medically significant bacteria (Davies and Davies 2010).",

In the case of bacteria, our evolutionary relationship is distant meaning we have had a lot of time to evolve to be different and there are many selective targets; however, this is not the case with fungi to which we are relatively similar on a cellular basis. Viruses present a more difficult problem again, as they do not have their own metabolic or growth capabilities; instead, they use those of the host cell; technically, they are known as obligate intracellular organisms. Therefore, damaging viruses or preventing their growth usually means damaging the infected host cells, and while the immune system is able to differentiate infected from non-infected cells, it is more difficult to find drugs that are able to do this. This explains why drug formularies contain many antibacterial drugs and far fewer antifungal and antiviral drugs and why some of the latter are associated with the toxicities and adverse effects resulting from poor selective toxicity; that is they damage the microorganism but also the host. Protozoa are even more problematic because they often have a complex life cycle, are relatively similar to human cells in many respects, and are often found in developing countries with limited healthcare budgets.",

There are many ways of identifying bacteria, for example, by shape; by their ability to take up and retain certain stains (e.g. Gram\u2019s stain); by their susceptibility to antimicrobials (antibiogram); or, increasingly, by molecular methods. The first three of these are known as phenotypic traits, that is, they are observable characteristics; the latter are genotypic, being based on bacterial genetics. Although most tests used in everyday practice identify phenotypic characteristics, molecular and genetic methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are becoming increasingly important.",

The bacterial cell wall is an important target because it is a structure that is lacking from human cells and is made of a substance known as peptidoglycan, which again human cells do not have; thus, it is a very good selective target. Bacterial ribosomes are a target not because these are lacking in humans, but because they are of different sizes, so most drugs that bind to bacterial ribosomes do not bind to the human equivalents. Similarly, some of the enzymes involved in the reproduction of bacterial nucleic acid are different to their equivalents in humans. Folic acid synthesis is an example of a metabolic process that differs between bacteria and humans; while bacteria synthesise their own folic acid, humans gain theirs from the diet. Hence, blocking the synthesis of folic acid production is selective against bacteria.",

A further complication is that many people who have severe systemic fungal diseases also have comorbidities, in particular, immunodeficiencies, further compromising the ability to treat the infection. Fungi can take two main forms: a yeast-like form that usually grows on surfaces and a hyphal form where it grows as finger-like projections that can force their way between cells and so become invasive; this is sometimes referred to as being a \u2018mould\u2019 (one may see these growing on bread).

The other main target is ergosterol which is a component of the fungal cell membrane, a structure that humans do have, but in fungi the membrane sterol is ergosterol, in humans the equivalent is cholesterol. Although there is a difference between these two sterols, the difference is not great, reducing the selective toxicity and explaining some of the toxicities associated with the main drugs that bind to this, the polyene drugs amphotericin B and nystatin. Amphotericin, which has historically been the most important drug for treatment of severe fungal disease, has a range of toxicities including nausea, vomiting, rigours, fever and hypotension or hypertension. However, of most concern is its effect upon the renal system, where it can cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in those individuals with existing renal problems, on high doses, who are dehydrated or on other nephrotoxic drugs (Laniado-Labor\u00edn and Cabrales-Vargas 2009).",

In these cases, the treatment approach might be to give combination empirical therapy (empirical meaning treatment based not on test results, but on knowledge and experience of what they are most likely to have). As there is limited information available, such therapies are often less targeted and broad spectrum antimicrobial medications are prescribed (the spectrum referring to the range of organisms targeted by the drug). In addition to broadening the spectrum of the therapy, combinations might also show synergy, that is, the drugs work better together than on their own.
