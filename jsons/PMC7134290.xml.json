The rapid development of blockchain or distributed ledger technologies has paved way for various Financial Technology (FinTech) innovations. Alongside venture capitalists and FinTech startups, major banks and stock exchanges have rolled out blockchain-based products and services. Furthermore, according to Barontini and Holden [4] several central banks have established explorative as well as experimental blockchain-based initiatives as a part of the prospect for central bank-issued crypto- or digital currencies.",

In brief, the theory posits that: (i) incumbents ignore the arrival of innovations that enter the market from niche position (originally from the low-end), (ii) incumbents overshoot their offering aims leaving room for simpler and easier offerings, and (iii) incumbents invest in sustaining innovations that fit their existing profitability, but ignore investing in potential new openings that would require new, sometimes even cannibalizing business models to become profitable [12, 16, 17, 27, 28].",

From the perspective of the system, disruption is an event in which a substantial share of agents belonging to the system is disrupted\u201d (p. 276). In the realm of digital disruption, Skog et al. [29] dig deeper: they define digital disruption as \u201cThe rapidly unfolding processes through which digital innovation comes to fundamentally alter historically sustainable logics for value creation and capture by unbundling and recombining linkages among resources or generating new ones. Skog et al. further conceptualize digital disruption to pertain three constitutive elements, namely digital innovation, digital ecosystem, and value logics. They define digital innovation as \u201cprocess of combining digital and physical components to create novel devices, services or business models, bundling them to constitute and enable market offerings, and embedding them in wider sociotechnical environments to enable their diffusion, operation and use\u201d (p. 433). Digital ecosystems in turn are \u201csociotechnical networks of interdependent digital technologies and associated actors that are related based on a specific context of use\u201d (p. 433). Finally, they define value logics as \u201cfoundational rationales for designing, bundling and embedding a digital innovation to fruitfully create and capture value\u201d (p. 434).",

Fundamentally this level explores the mechanisms of meaning, the why of social action.

Many people converted their bolivars to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to preserve their financial assets. Moreover, salaries have been increasingly paid in cryptocurrencies instead of bolivars.
