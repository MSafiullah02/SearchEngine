This study investigated the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in musculoskeletal patients and gives an overview of musculoskeletal CEUS applications. Patients and Methods: Based on 13 studies in a standardized monocentric setting, a total of 2268 CEUS examinations in 764 patients were performed and AEs due to the administration of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent were classified as either mild, moderate or severe. Results: No fatal events occurred. AEs were reported in three cases, of which only one was classified as severe and two as mild. The total rate of all AEs was 0.13% and 0.04% for severe AEs. Conclusion: The present analysis confirms the safety of musculoskeletal CEUS using sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent with a lower rate of AEs than that reported for other contrast agents even in elderly patients with concomitant diseases.",

            "text": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows insight into microperfusion of various tissues by ultrasonic waves. CEUS has become popular in recent years and is already integrated into the clinical routine in internal medicine. Since the first guidelines in 2004, CEUS has been particularly used in the context of supporting diagnostics of liver, spleen, as well as kidney cancer and lesions. [1] [2] [3] Especially Celli et al provided results with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy regarding the diagnosis between benign and malignant liver lesions. 4 The review of Rettenbacher confirmed these results and suggested that CEUS is the imaging modality of choice for differentiation of focal liver lesions and may replace more expensive imaging techniques like MRI. 5 The current 2017 guidelines of the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) introduced CEUS for non-hepatic applications. Concerning the musculoskeletal area of application, its use has especially been described in inflammatory joint diseases; 6 however, CEUS can also be applied to assess the microperfusion as a surrogate parameter for the vitality of bone and muscle tissue. 7, 8 Previous reports on the applicability of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agents (SonoVue \u00ae , Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) in internal medicine demonstrated a complication rate as low as 0.0086%. 1, 9 In contrast, this study regarding safety analysis at an university trauma and orthopedic ultrasound center focused exclusively on musculoskeletal indications for CEUS, specifically highlighting its applicability and benefits in trauma and orthopedic surgery.",

            "text": "The contrast agent, which is commonly used for CEUS examinations, consists of millions of sulfur hexafluoride bubbles with a phospholipid shell, an echogenic, poorly soluble gas, which oscillates measurably upon collision with ultrasonic waves. 9 Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent microbubbles are almost as large as erythrocytes and therefore remain intravascular in the capillaries after injection. Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent presents a high reflectivity, allowing the visualization of tissue microcirculation. 10 The average in vivo half-life of these microbubbles is 12 minutes (range, 2-33 minutes). 11 Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent is not excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, it can be used in patients with renal dysfunction, when contrast agents for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are contraindicated. Sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent does not interact with other organ systems, apart from the lungs and the liver through which the microvesicles are extracted from the body within 10 to 15 minutes by exhaling 12 and the phospholipid shell is metabolized by the liver. Furthermore, sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent does not deposit in the human body like the MRI contrast agent Gadolinium, which, after serial application, has been identified in human and animal brain, liver, skin and bone. 13 In addition, sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent has a lower sideeffect profile than the MRI contrast agent gadolinium. 14 Contraindications for MRI like implanted cardiac pacemakers or defibrillator systems, insulin pumps, cochlear implants and metal splinters or vascular clips made of ferromagnetic material, tattoos with metal-containing pigments, non-removable piercings made of magnetic materials, allergic reactions or incompatibility to gadolinium and economic aspects (high expenditure of time, increasing costs) do not apply for CEUS examinations. Moreover, CEUS is easily accessible, quick to use, well tolerated by patients and allows a real-time diagnostic workup. 15 Since 2012, musculoskeletal CEUS examinations were applied to assess microperfusion of tendon, muscle, 16, 17 as well as osseous perfusion of healing bone, 18,19 infected nonunions and its surrounding tissue 20,21 for various clinical issues. Among multiple interactions and relationships, a strong correlation could be demonstrated between CEUSbased muscle perfusion of the deltoid or supraspinatus muscle with shoulder function before and after surgery, potentially allowing an outcome prediction for eg tendon integration after rotator cuff repair by preoperative CEUS. Furthermore, CEUS-based quantification of osseous microperfusion allowed the identification of infections in fracture non-unions and is related to the healing process of longbone fractures.",

In studies involving the muscular system, the healthy contralateral sides were routinely examined as well to compare tissue perfusion. Patients, who were treated with a reversed shoulder arthroplasty, got an additional power Doppler examination to visualize the perfusion of the deltoid and teres minor muscle. The ultrasound examiner categorized the perfusion qualitatively from 1 (minimal perfusion) to 3 (maximum perfusion). A significantly weaker deltoid perfusion on the operated shoulder could be demonstrated. 16 Regarding the detection of osseous microperfusion, patients with long-bone fractures, non-unions ( Figure 2 ) as well as after high tibial open wedge osteotomy ( Figure 3 ) in lower limb varus malalignment were examined to visualize and analyze the perfusion of fracture, non-union 18-20 and osteotomy gaps. These studies intended to decode the process of bone regeneration with respect to the osseous microperfusion at different points of time and analyze the mechanisms of failed consolidation, especially in infected non-unions. 18-20",

The quantification of perfusion via disruption-replenishment kinetic loops with a constant venous infusion was not feasible for musculoskeletal issues and the measurement of quantitative and semiquantitative tissue parameters. It has been used only in cardiology so far, 24 so that we chose to quantify via bolus administration. 25 After the administration of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent bolus, it always rinsed with 10 mL of 0.9% saline solution (NaCl). Subsequently, the CEUS examination in the Siemens-specific Cadence\u2122 (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) contrast pulse sequencing mode started at the relevant body region for the respective study. In each case, a 90-120 seconds video was recorded in the dual view of contrast Cadence\u2122 with conventional B-mode of the ultrasound device.

This has most commonly been associated with the placement of intravenous access and pre-or postoperative pain. In contrast, one patient showed symptoms of an anaphylactic-anaphylactoid reaction with tachycardia, hypertension and dyspnea. Of note, all three AEs took place within minutes after contrast agent administration. Among the three cases of AEs, two had similar concomitant diseases, including hypertension and metabolic disorder. But an immediate relation between the AEs and the patients\u0107 linical risk profiles could not be identified. Although in our analysis AEs were only observed at initial application, Piscaglia et al described one AE after the fourth injection of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent. This implies, in general, that the lack of any reaction during previous sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent administrations does not exclude the possibility of any reactions later in the follow-up examinations. Therefore, attention should be spent on possible later reactions in repeated CEUS examinations. For patients with similar risk profiles, either an extended observation about 30 minutes after CEUS examination should be performed, or these patients should not undergo a CEUS examination with sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent. If CEUS is indeed necessary, an efficient emergency protocol is needed for a timely treatment of patients with severe AEs. If discomfort occurs while contrast agent is injected, the injection should immediately be stopped.",
