There is no doubt that health communication is especially sensitive due to its importance and implications, so HOs must respond to the needs of citizens, which demand more participation and information in health [2]. In fact, Health 2.0 is grounded on the idea that medical care must move away from hospital-based attention and focus on promoting health, providing domestic health care and instructing consumers and patients to take responsibility for their own health [3]. All this has generated a new paradigm in health communication in which the HOs, continually exposed to public scrutiny due to the social importance of their services [4], have found in social media a vehicle through which to involve society in the organization.",

First, previous literature has dealt with the motivations, uses, advantages and disadvantages of this communication channel for health communication [8,18,19,20]. Given the consensus reached on the potential value of social networks [21], a new line of research focused on online engagement has emerged. Social media engagement can be defined as a multi-way interaction between and among an organization and digital communities. Using social media channels facilitates interaction, and health messaging is shared in a way that creates opportunities for information to be acted on by the audience [21]. Its analysis and understanding could lead to better practices that could enhance interactive behaviors, encouraging user engagement with the organization and thus improving the effectiveness of health information dissemination [14]. In addition, it opens a dialogue between society and the organization, which allows both parties to work collaboratively to address issues that affect health and well-being in general. The importance of this concept in the health sector leads to it being considered a tool at the service of the \u201ccommon good\u201d [22].",

The authors of [25] state that posts with a good engagement rate were significantly associated with a health education post and a risk communication post. Finally, literature shows that controversial issues such as vaccination, or sensitive topics as cancer, attract the attention of users and generate debate [55,58] and that the audience is willing to commit when the organization provides relevant educational and news content [59].",

Of the five topic categories under which the contents of the posts were classified, only one, related to the dissemination of scientific knowledge developed in fields such as cancer, vaccines, new drugs or results of different medical studies, positively influences the level of online engagement with HOs. In this sense, the HOs analyzed take advantage of the interactive potential of controversial health topics to generate debate [55,58], in order to attract the user and trigger a reaction which leads them to engage with the organization. Another interesting finding is that posts related to health promotion have a greater specific weight in the classification of topics [23]. However, they do not have a significant effect on the users\u2019 commitment, contradicting the results of [25], who associate the highest participation rates with health educational posts. This could be due to the fact that this is the content that users expect to find in HOs\u2019 social networks, not finding it relevant and are therefore not motivated to engage in further interaction beyond the initial access to the information. Therefore, HOs must take special care in the content disclosed, in that it must be relevant to the user [59], and should move away from informative content to promote the organization, since users can perceive that this type of posts focus more on the interest of the organization than on the public interest [14].",

From an organizational standpoint, embedding social media into the HO\u00b4s communication strategies can help these organizations to increase their visibility in the market, strengthen their corporate image and strategic position and reach their target audience.

Our findings show that HOs could improve their users\u2019 engagement by encouraging them to express their feelings, opinions or concerns through \u201ccomments\u201d and posting information through attractive, visually rich and interactive formats (such as videos). Furthermore, users show great interest in content related to scientific knowledge, especially regarding controversial topics (such as vaccinations or new drugs) or topics in which there is a particular social awareness (i.e., cancer), urgency or lack of knowledge (such as the Ebola epidemic in 2014\u20132016 or the recent COVID-19 pandemic thread in 2020). HOs may also be missing opportunities to connect with their audience, since the hours and days of posting are not optimally exploited. HOs should reschedule both the posting day and the time of the day beyond business days or hours. In this regard, technological advances could help in this task, programming the content publication at a time that is more likely to generate user interaction, such as evening hours and during the weekend. This combined strategy could allow HOs to reach a wider audience and to achieve higher levels of engagement, disseminating health related information in a simple but effective way, and meeting the user\u2019s needs for knowledge and the establishment of bidirectional communication with health experts.",

These results point out that public and larger HOs are much more aware of the resources they have at their disposal to disseminate information and engage their users, generating value without increasing their costs. Furthermore, users living in poorer regions are more involved with HOs, so it is possible that they may be missing an opportunity by not connecting with large audiences in more affluent regions, which are critically important for private HOs.",

Regarding Resource Dependence Theory, smaller HOs should take advantage of the interactive potential offered by social media to reduce uncertainty and resource dependence, due to the optimal relationship between assuming lower costs of implementation and maintenance and reaching a wider audience. Pertaining to Media Richness Theory, our findings support the view that not all formats present the same level of engagement, with video and photos having a greater impact on users\u2019 engagement. Finally, it is also worth noting the relevance of the Uses and Gratifications Theory, since the findings of our research confirm that, in order to be effective, HOs should ensure that posts are relevant and in line with users\u2019 interests.

Furthermore, the treatment of photo-based posts has represented an added difficulty, and data downloaded with the Facebook API depends on the organization\u2019s privacy settings and some explicative factors that have not been considered. These limitations could be overcome in future research and lead to new studies. It would be interesting to carry out research in areas where the health system is not as well considered, as in the case of underdeveloped countries, in order to establish a comparison that would help to address possible deficiencies in health communication in the latter. In addition, new research delimiting the medical specialty of the organization and the organization\u00b4s reputation, as well as analyzing other actors involved in health communication, would help to understand the social media phenomenon. Similarly, other factors in addition to those considered in this study would be interesting to explore, such as the sentiment of messages or a specific analysis of the audiovisual content posted by the organization. Likewise, with the aim of contributing to an expansion and enrichment of the current literature on this topic, a more in-depth content analysis could be performed by applying different emotion lexicon or by establishing a classification criterion of topics based on the preferences of Facebook users identified through a previous survey.",
