Unnecessary antibiotic use is regarded as a driving force in the global increase of antibiotic resistance.

Because of small fractions of positive samples, Gram staining of sputum specimens probably cannot lead to great decreases in antibiotic use or costs [29] . Therefore, improvements of diagnostic methods and policies to decrease antibiotic use in patients with LRTI are necessary.
