At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of infection and mortality from COVID-19. According to the updated Italian statistics released on March 25, 2020, 74 386 people had been infected, with 7503 deaths [5]. The dramatic spread of this epidemic is leading to major changes in the management of patients with cancer, including those affected by genitourinary malignancies [6]. In this context, virtually all urology centres have been forced to prioritise surgical interventions for cancer patients by applying a series of restrictions on elective approaches to optimise health care resources and minimise the risk of hospital-acquired infection [4], [7], [8], [9]. This prioritisation process started early in Italy [3], [4].",

Among the surgeries, Stensland et al [7] included radical cystectomy (RC), radical nephroureterectomy (RNU), nephrectomy (NEP) for cT3+ disease, and radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk patients if not eligible for radiation. From an analytic standpoint, besides all RC, RNU, and NEP procedures for cT3+ tumours, we also considered NEP for cT2 masses as high-priority surgery, as the decision-making is highly nuanced for several patient-specific considerations and the tumour growth rate [7]. In addition, we included RPs for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (defined according to the European Association of Urology guidelines [9]) because even though alternative treatment strategies may be offered, their availability for all eligible patients could be potentially limited by logistic issues in times of emergency.",
