To gain a comprehensive understanding of antibody to SARS CoV, additional clarification, such as that which would be gained by moredetailed profiles of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS CoV (by such convenient assays as ELISA), was required.

Serological assay, however, is of little value during the incubation and initial phases of the illness, because of late seroconversion in most patients ( figure 1A ). In addition, our results indicated that 9 (25.0%) of 36 patients with probable SARS CoV infection had not produced detectable anti-SARS CoV antibody by day 21 after the onset of fever; this implies that 25.0% of patients with SARS might be misdiagnosed by the laboratory confirmation guidelines that WHO currently recommends [5] . However, this was not the case in our study, because (1) 3 of these 9 patients were later confirmed, by detection of seroconversion before day 47, to be infected by SARS CoV and (2) the 6 other patients, who had remained negative for anti-SARS CoV antibody until day 60, were later confirmed, by fulfillment of WHO criteria and by exclusion of other pathogenic infections, to be infected by SARS CoV. Specifically, all of the patients with probable SARS CoV infection came into contact with someone with SARS, had documented persistent fever (138\u040aC), showed a consistent clinical course of the ill- ness, and showed evidence of pneumonia, by plain radiography and/or computed tomography; in addition, there was no evidence of infection by other pathogens (including influenza viruses A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, Chlamdia pneumoniae, C. psittaci, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and there was no conventional pathogenic bacterial infection and no response to antibiotic treatment (0.3 g of levofloxacin/day for 48-72 h). The discrepancy between our diagnosis of SARS in these patients and diagnosis on the basis of WHO guidelines likely reflects the evolution of the identification of definitive SARS cases, as more data on the disease accumulate; the current WHO guidelines are probably not 100% accurate. It is notable that, on 16 July 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its laboratory criteria in its definition of SARS, to require that convalescent serum be collected 128 days, instead of 121 days, after the onset of symptoms [11] . The choice of day 28 presumably reflects data indicating that 195% of patients with SARS mount a detectable convalescent antibody response [11] . A more technical explanation for our identification of late-seroconverting patients may involve differences between the sensitivity of the ELISA used in the present study and the sensitivity of other serological assays, on which the WHO guidelines are based; this issue should be further clarified as more data are collected. In 6 of our patients with a late antibody response, there may have been other mitigating factors that could have led to a decrease in basic immunity. Of these 6 patients, 2 (who were 165 old) had emphysema, 1 had diabetes, 1 was hypertensive and had coronary artery disease, 1 had tetanus, and 1 was pregnant; these conditions may be associated with late seroconversion in these patients. It is notable that a few (2 of 36 [5.6%]) patients with probable SARS CoV infection were positive for IgG antibody to SARS CoV but, until day 60, were negative for IgM antibody to SARS CoV; the reason for this is uncertain, but one possible explanation is that, in these 2 cases, IgM antibody to SARS CoV persisted for a short time and had disappeared before the patients were admitted to the hospital.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 962, "end": 965, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2607, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2749, "end": 2753, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 633, "text": "figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We found production of IgG antibody to SARS CoV to be associated with host T cell immunity, because patients who did not produce IgG antibody to SARS CoV had significantly lower CD3 + CD4 + T cell percentages, compared with those in patients who seroconverted.

Recently, we treated 1 pregnant patient with severe SARS CoV infection by using convalescent plasma in which the titer of IgG antibody to SARS CoV was 11:500; the IgG antibody could be detected until 60 days after the infusion, 2 days before her own IgG antibody to SARS CoV appeared. With combined treatment with the antiviral drug methylprednisolone and convalescent serum, she recovered fully. However, whether the IgG antibody to SARS CoV is itself a neutralizing antibody needs further study. Recently, Krokhin et al. reported that acute and early convalescent serum, obtained from several patients recovering from SARS, can react only with the 46-kDa nucleoprotein (which appears to be the major antigen) of SARS CoV [12] . Their results suggest that immune response to this nucleoprotein could serve as an early diagnostic indicator for infection; however, it is unlikely that immune response to this protein offers protection, because it is an internal protein and because neutralizing antibodies are more likely to target cellsurface proteins [13] . Nevertheless, it has been shown, for other CoVs, that some antigenic peptides of the nucleoprotein can be recognized on the surface of infected cells by host T cells [13] ; thus, the appearance of IgG antibody in patients with SARS will more likely be an indicator of the production of protective immunity against SARS CoV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1386, "end": 1390, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1719, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1892, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our results also indicate that all individuals positive for anti-SARS CoV antibody should present symptoms, whether severe or not. From 9 Feb 2003 to the time when this article was written, our hospital admitted 52 patients with probable SARS CoV infection and 48 patients with suspected SARS CoV infection; however, at our hospital there is not a single health-care worker infected with SARS CoV-a situation that is in stark contrast to that at other hospitals in China, where nearly one-third of patients with SARS are health-care workers [14] . That our hospital has no health-care workers infected by SARS CoV was confirmed by both serological assay and lack of detection of SARS CoV RNA. The 96 health-care workers who participated in our study all came into close contact with patients with SARS, for a period of 3 months, but IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS CoV were not detected in the serum of the health-care workers. These results may be somewhat difficult to interpret-and it was certainly not the point of our study to investigate this matter-but their implications may be very important; they suggest that the possibility that people can be asymptomatically infected by SARS CoV-and that such individuals (if they do exist) can transmit the virus-might be very small. The preventive measures taken at our hospital were almost exactly the same as those taken at other hospitals, with the only known difference being that, for prophylaxis, the health-care workers at our hospital took 400 mg of ribavirin/ day. We must caution, however, that these are only anecdotal observations; further study is necessary to determine whether ribavirin has a prophylactic effect against SARS CoV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 545, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "World Health Organization.
