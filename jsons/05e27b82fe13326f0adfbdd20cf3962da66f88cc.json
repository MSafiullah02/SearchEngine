There exist four multi-frame extensions of BM3D as of today. In this work, we combine these extensions with a variance stabilising transformation (VST) for eliminating Poisson noise. Our evaluation reveals that the extension which retains the original noise model of the noisy images and additionally has a comprehensive connectivity of 2D and temporal image information at both pixel and patch levels, gives the best results. Additionally, we find a surprising change in performance of one the four extensions due to the specific application of the VST. Finally, we also introduce a simple low-pass filtering as a preprocessing step for the best performing extension. This can give rise to a significant additional improvement of 0.94 dB in the output according to the peak signal to noise ratio.",

In particular, depending on the temporal standard deviation after registration, they use a combination of values computed through simple averaging of the frames and primitive spatiotemporal non-local patch-based methods. We have revived the research in this direction in [28] , by studying all possible spatio-temporal extensions of 3D block matching in the multiframe scenario. In particular, we have evaluated our proposed extensions and existing ones for eliminating AWGN. We have learnt from this evaluation that using multi-frame extension ideas which retain the noise model and simultaneously enhance the connectivity between frames, give superior results. The optimal performance of such ideas in the AWGN layout, motivates us to also analyse their capability in the multi-frame Poisson noise scenario.",

For this purpose, we combine all four extensions with the Anscombe transform and the closed-form approximation of the exact unbiased inverse Anscombe transform. The difference in the qualitative performance according to peak-signalto-noise (PSNR) ratio, between the closed-form approximation and the exact unbiased inverse is small, but the former is faster [12] . Hence, we use the closed-form approximation for computing the inverse variance stabilising transformation.

In this work we want to specifically test the denoising capability of different extensions of BM3D. To this end, we assume that the frames are perfectly registered similar to [28] . This assumption makes even more sense because it has already been verified [20, 22] that denoising methods (even without temporal support) are superior to averaging at regions where there is high temporal standard deviation after registration. Thus, verifying the performance of different denoising methods assuming perfect registration also covers the remaining case of less temporal standard deviation. Thereby, to create this experimental setting, we have added Poisson noise to the Lena, House, Peppers and Bridge 1 images with noise peaks varying from 1 to 5. Due to the signal dependent nature of Poisson noise, we have high noise amplitude when the intensity of the signal decreases. The noise peak value controls this trade-off. Lesser noise peak value indicates higher amount of noise. For every image and every noise peak, we have created two datasets each with 5 and 10 realisations of noise. Dissolving the threshold parameters for L 2 distance while forming the 3D groups is advantageous to all the extensions. Hence, we have excluded this parameter in both the main steps of BM3D for all the four extensions.",
