These investigations have been pursued both on the basis of experimental research and upon theoretical methodologies based on ab initio calculations.1 The evolution of theory and the use of increasingly powerful computers and software increased the level of theory applied to more complex molecular systems. The electron density analysis, as proposed by Domingo\u2019s Molecular Electron Density theory,2 promises to go into deep of cycloaddition reaction mechanisms, and the methods seem to offer novel opportunities with respect to the studies based on simple molecular orbital (MO) interactions, as well as on the Frontier MO (FMO) theory, typically employed in the last century. New theoretical investigations, based on accurate experimental studies, built new, solid, reactivity models for these relevant types of organic reactions that allow a profound rationalization; the new findings imply strong and significant repercussions on cycloaddition reactions and applications in modern organic chemistry and synthesis, specifically. The matter is quite complex, and more and more discussions will appear in literature in the next years as the level of complexity of the theoretical investigation increases with the development of new computational clusters.",

Books dedicated to cycloaddition reactions deal typically with the synthesis of heterocycles, general organic synthesis applications, specific applications in natural product synthesis, or they describe the use of a class of organic compounds as partners in cycloaddition reactions.3 In 2016, a book appeared in the Topic in Current Chemistry Collections dealing with the bioorthogonal chemistry edited by Vrabel and Carrell. This represents a first example of a book dedicated to the view of cycloadditions in modern organic chemistry. However, other subjects still demand a general review since in recent years pericyclic reactions were extensively applied to different chemistry areas such as chemical biology, biological processes, catalyzed cycloaddition reactions, delivery of antiviral or anticancer drugs, targeting of biological active molecules, material chemistry with applications in medicine, photovoltaic processes, photochemistry, energy harvesting, and so on. None of these topics, where cycloaddition reactions spread out, has received a unifying overview in a single book that could offer a solid background for future development in these and other subjects. Moreover, the chronological structure of the references regarding a general topic allows the reader to recognize the relevance of specific subjects during the past decades and the evolution of the synthesis with respect to specific active compounds. This book aims to fill the gap, shedding a new light over pericyclic reactions and demonstrating how these valuable tools may elegantly solve synthetic and mechanistic problems in modern organic chemistry.",

Few reactions rival these processes in synthetic utility, mainly in the field of heterocyclic chemistry. Five-membered heterocycles are the synthetic target of these reactions and their ability to produce heterocycles extends the importance of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to other areas of organic chemistry, not strictly related to the ring formation processes. Moreover, the introduction of new chiral catalysts allowed for the control of new stereocenters derived from the cycloaddition reactions with the valuable stereochemical outcome borne by the newly synthesized molecules. If these molecules are drugs, this is a key point for determining the success of a synthetic approach.",

This is the case of the influenza viruses; the virus surface proteins have changed and are not recognizable by the human immune system any longer. Sometimes the virus genoma can be exchanged from humans to animals and back to humans, determining new pandemic situations and social alarms. Viral infections are quite detrimental since, contrary to bacteria, viruses cannot be defeated with antibiotics. Until very recently, a small number of antiviral compounds could be used in the pharmacological treatment of these diseases. Luckily, not only are viruses in progress, so are chemical research and synthetic approaches to new and powerful methods for the contrast to viral infections. The demand of antiviral compounds is constantly increasing and chemistry is constantly under examination to furnish novel strategies for a large-scale preparation of active molecules.4\n",

The research subject offers also a brilliant example of joint efforts from academia and pharmaceutical industries. The influenza infection is known to be a serious health concern, and the cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries. Current options for its treatment and prevention sometimes have severe limitations, underscoring the need for new, effective antiinfluenza agents. Influenza NA is one of the two major surface glycoproteins expressed by influenza viruses. NA promotes the cleavage of the terminal sialic acid residues attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids.5 Therefore, NA represents a potential target for developing antiinfluenza agents. In fact, in 1999 a merged research group by Gilead Sciences Inc. and Roche Discovery proposed the synthesis of a 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridazine derivative and its C-5 epimer, which possess side chains similar to compound GS4071. These compounds were synthesized via HDA reaction, and evaluated as influenza NA inhibitors. Both compounds exhibited a \u03bcM range of influenza NA inhibitory activity.6 The strategy followed is based on an HDA cycloaddition reaction between the hydrazone 3 and alkene 4 in the presence of sodium carbonate in acetonitrile to afford a 1:3 mixture of the desired cycloadduct 5 and its regioisomer in 87% yield (Scheme 1.1\n).",

The influenza NA inhibitory activity of compound 6 is reported in Scheme 1.1. Compound 6, having a similar side chain and stereochemistry (trans) to GS4071, exhibited IC50 of 6 \u03bcM against influenza A and 62 \u03bcM against influenza B. Increased activity was resulted from converting the amino group of 6 into the guanidine functionality. The relatively weak NA inhibitory activity of 6 compared to that of GS4071 can be explained from conformational and binding studies. These investigations revealed that the NH2 and NHAc groups of 6 occupy the pseudo-axial positions, rather than the normally preferred pseudo-equatorial positions that are adopted on binding to influenza NA, indicating that an energy penalty is incurred upon the binding. In addition, the X-ray structure of 6 bound to NA reveals a different binding mode for the 3-pentyl side chain as compared with that of GS4071. In the case of GS4071, the two ethyl groups of the 3-pentyl side chain bind in two different pockets. However, presumably owing to the partly planar nature of the amide bond, the 3-pentyl side chain of 6 poorly fits and exposes the hydrophobic group to water.6\n",

            "text": "A fruitful collaboration between the University of Manchester and a research group of a big chemical company, GlaxoSmithKline, was established in 2001 for the synthesis of new inhibitors of influenza virus sialidases. Structurally related cyclohexene derivatives, Zanamivir 7 and GS4071 (administered in prodrug form as Oseltamivir), are known to interfere with viral replication by acting as potent inhibitors of virus sialidases. These enzymes, located on the viral surface, cleave the \u03b1-glycosidic bond of terminal sialic acid residues. Zanamivir 7 and GS4071 bind to the active site of a sialidase in an analogous manner. Whereas the trihydroxypropyl side chain binds to a hydrophilic pocket via hydrogen bonding interactions, the pentyloxy function is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket. The importance of the substituent structures has been demonstrated in several binding studies and structural modification by replacement of selected substituents aimed to tune properly the inhibitory activity. For example, the replacement of the trihydroxypropyl side chain by a dialkylcarbamoyl entity leads to compounds that retain potency against influenza A sialidase but lose effectiveness against influenza B sialidase. Surprisingly, in this series, the guanidino function appears to play no role in binding to influenza A sialidase. Also the location of the C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC double bond seems to be critical and the retrosynthetic analysis has to take into account the generation of regioisomers. The synthesis of two novel compounds, whose inhibition activity was evaluated in comparison with the GS4071, is based upon a DA tactic between the nitro acrylamide 8 and the diene 9 (Scheme 1.2\n).7\n",

As told before, pandemic is attributed to a mutation of influenza virus proteins that allows the virus to evade the human immune system. As result of today\u2019s extensive global transport, a local influenza epidemic cannot be restricted to a specific area. Because of the high mutation frequency of influenza virus, an effective antiinfluenza drug should target fundamental molecular processes that are essential and specific for the life cycle of the virus. This principle is based on the hypothesis that structures of fundamental proteins are conserved even in mutant viruses, and NA belongs to these virus proteins. An influenza virion budding from an infected cell binds to a terminal sialic acid residue on the host cell surface glycoprotein with hemagglutinin (HA: Fig. 1.3\n). NA hydrolytically cleaves the glycosidic bond of sialic acid to release the virus from the host cell surface. This process liberates the budding virion from the infected cell and is essential for spreading the infection. As expected, the active site of NA is highly conserved across the influenza A and B virus strains. Therefore, an NA inhibitor is a prime candidate for broad spectrum antiinfluenza drugs.\n",

Several derivatives having more potent antiviral activity than the lead compound 43 were obtained and, especially, the Triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) derivative 44 was revealed to have the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and good therapeutic index.20 These results prompted the authors to investigate the possibility of revealing dihydrofuran-fused compounds as a new class of antiinfluenza agents possessing a novel structural characteristic.21 The inhibitory activity of the some compounds including 43 and 44 was investigated against viral growth in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2 subtype) virus strain at 10 mM drug concentration. The results showed that several compounds inhibited the virus growth and could have potential as new antiinfluenza agents. In particular, some modified structure of 43 exhibited potent activity, suppressing the virus proliferation up to ca. 30% of control.",

Many new synthetic procedures of 19 without using shikimic acid have been explored because current industrial manufacturing may have shortages of shikimic acid for global supply during influenza pandemics. In these shikimate-independent syntheses, several different approaches can be utilized to construct the multiple substituted cyclohexene ring: (1) use of existing six-membered rings, (2) construction by DA reactions, (3) construction by intramolecular aldol, Dieckmann and Wittig reactions, (4) construction by tandem Michael\u2013Wittig reactions, (5) construction by olefin metathesis, and (6) construction by Claisen rearrangement. Phosphonate group is generally used as a bioisostere of carboxylate in drug design. The syntheses of Tamiphosphor (49) and Zanaphosphor (50), which are the phosphonate congeners of 19 and 7, were accomplished and shown to possess potent inhibitory activities against avian and human influenza viruses, including the Oseltamivir-resistant strain, according to the NA inhibition, cell-based assay, and mice experiments.",

These results agree with the previously described high face-selectivity of the DA process.

Catalytic osmylation in the presence of the cooxidant N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) gave in excellent yield the expected cis diols of type 61. These were transformed into the corresponding acetonide derivatives (i.e., 62). One-pot hydrogenolyses (H2/Pd/C) of the single N\u2013O bond and of the benzyloxycarbonyl moiety triggered molecular rearrangements, which led ultimately to pyrrolidine derivatives 63a,b. The formation of 63 results from a mechanistically straightforward multistep sequence: after hydrogenolysis of the O\u2013Bn and of the N\u2013O bonds, followed by decarboxylation, the hemiaminal functionality breaks up, leading to an aldehyde that condenses at once with the primary NH2-C(1) amine. The ensuing \u03941 pyrroline is then hydrogenated (Pd/C) to give pyrrolidine 63.

The following by reduction of the resulting terminal aldehyde with NaBH4 gave compound 67a in 85% (two steps) isolated yield. Finally, deprotection of 67a with K2CO3/EtOH afforded ethyl 2,6-anhydro-3-deoxy-d-gluco-heptanoate (68a).

It retains its activity even when treatments are delayed until 24 h postinfection and has no effect on the serum antibody response to infection.38 The method for the stereoselective introduction of hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-5 illustrated in this work may be also applicable to syntheses of other members in this series of compounds. Some further applications of this strategy in the syntheses of Kdn, Neu5Ac, GG167 analogs were investigated on the basis of the excellent HDA strategy.",

It has been emphasized that the relative positions of the interacting functional groups are essential for the NA inhibitory potency, rather than the absolute positions of the central rings. The stereoselective synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentane of BCX-1812 was described by Miller et al., emphasizing the utility of acylnitroso cycloaddition chemistry.31 As the starting material to synthesize NA inhibitor, the racemic oxazanorbornene derivative (\u00b1)-69 protected by a Boc group was synthesized (Scheme 1.14). Reductive N\u2013O bond cleavage of (\u00b1)-69 using Mo(CO)6 and NaBH4 gave the allylic alcohol (\u00b1)-70, which was converted to its ethyl carbonate by treatment with ethyl chloroformate. The ethyl carbonate moiety was replaced by the nitromethyl group by reaction with MeNO2 and a catalytic amount of Pd(0), to furnish the primary nitro compound that was transformed into the carboxylic acid by employing a mixture of NaNO2 and AcOH in Dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by treatment with a catalytic amount of (TMS)-Cl in MeOH to give the corresponding methyl ester (\u00b1)-71. While subsequent elaboration described later was carried out on racemic (\u00b1)-71, either enantiomer could be prepared starting from the corresponding antipodes of (\u00b1)-70, available from enzymatic resolutions. The authors utilized a nitrile oxide [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition for incorporation of key additional framework components and functionality. The 1,4-cis-relationship of the rather bulky Boc-protected amine and methyl ester groups of (\u00b1)-71 was anticipated to induce selective reaction of the nitrile oxide from the opposite face. However, while the regiochemistry of the reaction was less predictable, precedent indicated that it would proceed as desired.",

It was isolated from a strain of Streptomyces nitrosporeus by Omura et al.51 and was found to be a potent DNA and RNA virus inhibitor as well as an antifungal agent.52 Several total syntheses53 of racemic (\u00b1)-Virantmycin, natural (\u2212)-Virantmycin, and the unnatural (+)-antipode were proposed, stressing the importance and the promising pharmacological profile of the substance. Various synthetic approaches toward the construction of tetrahydroquinoline ring systems are available, including insertion, ring expansion, and ring contraction reactions. However, one of the most versatile and convergent strategies for the construction of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids is the HDA reaction of o-azaxylylenes, which are formed by a 1,4-elimination from a suitable benzylic halide precursor and suitable dienophiles. One key fragment for our synthetic route toward Virantmycin is arylthiocarbamate 91 (Scheme 1.18). This substance has been known for more than 110 years, but synthetic methodologies for its reliable and high-yield formation are scarce. The classical method developed by Paal and Laudenheimer, heating 2-aminobenzyl alcohol (89) in carbon disulfide at reflux for several hours without additional solvent, leads to formation of the desired product 91, via the intermediate 90, in a maximum yield of 30%, which can be raised to about 40% if the reaction is performed in a sealed vial. A second possibility includes the reaction of 2-azidobenzyl alcohol in the presence of triphenylphosphane in a Staudinger-type reaction leading to an iminophosphorane. This intermediate can be reacted with carbon disulfide in a sealed vial at elevated temperature to yield the cyclized product 91 in a yield of 53%.",

Besides the classical approach of identifying compounds by in vitro screens (i.e., by binding to an isolated protein), high-content cell-based screens have proven to be a powerful complementary approach.55 The proposal to employ the frameworks of natural product classes as evolutionary selected and biologically prevalidated starting points in structural space for compound collection development represent an interesting research route, developing a tree-like classification of the natural product frameworks identified in nature. The biology-oriented synthesis of compound collections derived from these natural product frameworks provides a promising strategy in the search of new biologically active agents and can be efficiently carried out on polymer-bound substrates, as they allow rapid diversification without intermediate purification steps. Natural product-derived and -inspired compound collections have been synthesized on the solid support in a number of cases.56 However, in order to meet the stereochemical demands of natural product frameworks, the use of enantioselective transformations on the solid phase presents a highly attractive though rarely addressed approach. Scheme 1.19\nreports the enantioselective solid-phase synthesis of a natural product-inspired \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b4-lactone collection and its investigation in cell-based screens, monitoring cell cycle progression, and viral entry into cells. The \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b4-lactone motif belongs to the most frequently occurring scaffolds in nature and is the characteristic underlying structural element of antiproliferative agents, immunosuppressants, and inhibitors for different enzymes, in particular protein phosphatases. For the development of an asymmetric solid-phase synthesis of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b4-lactones, the enantioselective oxa HDA reaction between aldehydes and electron-rich 1-alkoxydienes 99 immobilized on the polymeric carrier is the key in stereodifferentiating transformation. 1-Alkoxydienes 99 were synthesized on the solid support starting from a Wang bromo-resin 97 and subjected to enantioselective cycloaddition with ethyl glyoxylate 100 as the reactive heterodienophile (Scheme 1.19).",

Tamiflu was first developed by Gilead Science and is synthesized and marketed by Roche. Its production is performed starting from shikimic acid, a natural product, so that development of a new synthesis from nonnatural readily available chemical feedstock is required. The synthesis of Tamiflu was investigated by many groups in the world and the total synthesis was accomplished by Corey, Shibasaki, and others.59 To construct such a polyfunctionalized cyclohexene unit, an HDA approach between pyrroles and acetylene was investigated by a Japanese research group. The synthesis started from the HDA reaction of N-Boc-pyrrole 104 (Scheme 1.20\n). A solution of bromoacetylene carboxylate (105) in N-Boc-pyrrole (104) was heated at 90\u00b0C for 39 h and the DA adduct, 7-tert-butyl 2-methyl 3-bromo-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-2,7-dicarboxylate (106), was isolated in 57% yield. Treatment of 106 with mCPBA gave 5,6-epoxide 107 in 46% yield. The oxidation took place in a stereoselective manner and exo-107 was prepared as a single isomer. The use of oxone for the conversion resulted in the formation of a mixture of isomers. The authors succeeded in improving the yield of 107 up to 64% by repeating the reaction procedure twice. The reduction of 107 and basic hydrolysis yielded the corresponding carboxylic acid, that then opened the epoxide to give tricyclic lactone alcohol 108 in 89% yield in one step. Other synthetic steps were required to convert the lactone 108 into the enco-epoxide 109, obtained in 85% yield.",

They are typically found at the outermost end of glycan chains of all kind of cells and are involved in a variety of physiochemical and pathological processes. This class of sugars has structural and modulatory roles and serves as components of binding site for various pathogens and toxins; in addition, another important function they play is decorating microbial pathogens, allowing them to evade host immunity.63 Influenza virus is subdivided into three serologically distinct types\u2014A, B, and C\u2014all of which recognize sialic acid and its derivatives as their functional receptors. Sialidase is the influenza virus surface enzyme recognizing the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) moiety, which is typically associated as \u03b1-linked terminal saccharidic unit of mammalian glycoconjugates.64 In the search for new sialidase-inhibitor antiinfluenza drugs, the synthesis of a new class of exo enitols obtained from Neu5Ac and their use as electron-rich dienophiles in chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective HDA reactions with \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-dioxothiones as electron-poor dienes, to form diasteromerically pure \u03b2-Neu5Ac derivatives, structurally attractive for the development of new inhibitors of sialidase, was developed by Italian and Greek research groups.65\n",

Bound conformations retained all intermolecular interaction with the NA active site residues (Fig. 1.5A), displaying only minimal differences at the glycerol moiety. The estimated mean free energy of binding for Neu5Ac was \u22125.8 kcal/mol, corresponding to an inhibition constant of ~55 \u03bcM. Analysis of the docking results obtained for compounds 127 and 128 revealed a high number of distinct conformational clusters, many of which adopted a completely different binding mode in comparison with Neu5Ac. As a consequence, most of the hydrogen-bonding interactions displayed by Neu5Ac and the active site residues of NA are lost. On the other hand, docking of 127 and 128 in the same boat configuration as that of the bound Neu5Ac exhibited two conformational clusters that approximate the binding mode of Neu5Ac. For compound 127, the highest energy conformation of the top ranked cluster (15%), with a mean free energy of binding of \u22125.0 kcal/mol, is shown in Fig. 1.5B. In this binding mode, the carboxylate group is slightly shifted with respect to that of sialic acid (<1 \u00c5), thus maintaining the hydrogen-bonding network with Arg118, Arg292, and Arg371. However, for the proper accommodation of the oxathiine moiety inside the active site, the pyranose ring of 127 is rotated by ~45\u00b0 and shifted toward residue Ile222 by ~3 \u00c5, which results in loss of the hydrophobic contacts with Trp178. Compound 127 is predicted to interact with most of the residues displayed by Neu5Ac\u2013sialidase complex, albeit with a lower affinity that is mainly due to a loss of ~1.4 kcal/mol in the electrostatic energy term. As for compound 127, the p-fluorophenyl substituent gives rise to a larger shift of the oxathiine ring toward Arg118, thus losing contact with Arg292 (Fig. 1.5C). In this binding mode, the p-fluorophenyl group does not display contacts with any protein residue. In addition, the interaction between C4-OH of 128 and Glu119 is not present, and Glu276 exhibits only van der Waals contacts with the glycerol side-chain. For these reasons, compound 128 is predicted to bind sialidase with an even lower affinity (mean free energy of binding of \u22124.1 kcal/mol). Conclusively, the oxathiine ring of the spiroketal compounds might displace the pyranose ring from the crystallographic position displayed by sialic acid and its derivatives, though proper functionalization of the spiroketal scaffold could compensate for the interaction with key amino acid residues of NA. The new spiroketal scaffolds could represent a novel class of sialidase inhibitors.",

Key intermediate 191, which contains all carbons of the Wickerols except two, could be accessed with a DA addition of known enone 189 to diene 190. The synthesis commenced with the DA cycloaddition of the achiral enone 189 to the chiral diene 190 (Scheme 1.33\n).

Having set the correct configuration, the subsequent modification conducted to the compound 192, which led to the ring system of Wickerol A (194) complete with the introduction of the missing methyl groups. The methyl group on the D-ring could be added with complete diastereoselectivity by exposure of 193 to methyl lithiocyanocuprate in the presence of BF3\u00b7Et2O. Given the steric hindrance at the neopentyl \u03b2-position and the introduction of additional syn-pentane strain, it is remarkable that this reaction proceeded at all.

Remarkably, the antiviral activity profiles of both enantiomers are very similar. The enantioselective synthesis of the d- and l-enantiomers of these compounds starting from (R)-carvone was already described.93 However, the synthesis is long and time-consuming, and it is not suited for the preparation of large amounts of the final products that are needed for full biological evaluation.

Carbanucleosides are modified nucleosides in which a methylene group has replaced the oxygen atom of the furanose ring.95 Due to the absence of a glycosidic linkage, carbanucleosides are chemically more stable and not subjected to the phosphorylases that cleave the N-glycosidic linkage in conventional nucleosides. Many compounds of this class with potent and selective biological activity were identified, including carbovir and abacavir, which are currently used therapeutically as anti-HIV agents.96 An important aspect of the anti-HIV therapy is the suppression of viral replication in the brain; in this regard an enhanced lipophilicity of potential drugs is likely to be advantageous. The modification of some structures by fusion of a carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings to the carbasugar moiety increases the lipophilicity (and hence the access to the central nervous system, a major reservoir of HIV),97 maintaining at the same time the rigidity imposed by the C2\u2032\u2013C3\u2032 double bond. The synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides containing a fused isoxazoline ring and lacking a methylene group in the side chain of the carbocyclic unit was suggested as a new class of analogs.98 Nucleosides lacking a methylene group in the side chain have been reported and in some cases display reduced cytotoxicity. The synthetic route that was exploited is based on the HDA cycloaddition of dienes with transient acyl nitroso moieties,31 affording privileged structures for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides. The HDA cycloadduct N-benzoyl-2,3-oxazanorborn-5-ene 202 was obtained from freshly distilled cyclopentadiene that quantitatively trapped the nitrosocarbonyl benzene generated in situ in good yields through the mild oxidation of benzonitrile oxide Ph-CNO (BNO) with a slight excess of NMO according to the reported procedure (Scheme 1.35\n).31\n",

The first one is the condensation of the regioisomeric aminols 204a,b with the 5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine to give the pyrimidine derivatives of type 205a,b. This condensation is indeed the most difficult step in many reported syntheses, which attained only low yields (around 50%). Better yields of 205a,b were achieved by increasing the reaction temperature gradually up to the boiling point of the solvent and working in sealed tubes. The pyrimidine derivatives 205a,b were obtained in 79% yields for both regioisomeric compounds. The conversion of the pyrimidine derivatives 205a,b into the chloropurine compounds 206a,b, was achieved by treatment with ethyl orthoformate and a catalytic amount of pTsOH. The final chlorine replacement method with selected amines was conducted upon heating MeOH solutions of 205a,b at 50\u00b0C in the presence of an excess NH3 or some primary or secondary amines affording the adenine derivatives 207a,b in more than 92% yields, which have been submitted to the biological tests. Compounds 207a,b were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against a wide variety of viruses, including HSV-1, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, sindbis virus, coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, and respiratory syncytial virus.",

As we can see, there is a nice overlap of the anthracene and naphthalene aromatic rings while the second phenyl ring of the diphenyl moiety crosses the purine ring directing the sulfonyl group in the same position where the ethyl group is located. Moreover, the isoxazoline ring nicely overlaps the amide group. The larger activity shown by those compounds, which bear a naphthyl residue, could suggest a possible mechanism based on DNA-intercalation. Some isoxazolidinyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been proposed as DNA-intercalating antitumor agents and molecular modeling studies on these structures confirm the degree of binding when a polycyclic aromatic residue is linked to an isoxazoline heterocyclic ring.102\n",

Again, a remarkable antiviral activity was found for a specific regioisomer 212 with no cellular toxicity at 1\u2013100 \u03bcM dose concentration in the case of HPV.103 Regarding HPV, its complex replication machinery begins with the specific binding of E2 to the viral DNA and the recruitment of protein E1, which rapidly oligomerizes to a hexamer (around the nucleic acid) displaying its helicase activity. With this mechanism in mind, the binding affinity of the uracil derivative 212 was evaluated to the HPV11 E2 protein (Fig. 1.11\n). Flexible molecular docking of the uracil derivative 212 on this receptor gives a docking score that is comparable and even higher than the ones obtained through the self-docking of the crystallographic inhibitor.

Strong indications were obtained that 212 can specifically bind the DNA minor groove. The anticonfiguration between the uracil and anthracene substituents allows for the 212 backbone adaptations on the minor DNA groove. The interactions of the uracil ring as well as the cyclopentane hydroxyl group with the viral DNA are established with the heterobases of the nucleic acid, reasonably inhibiting in this way the DNA replication machinery.

Moreover, some structural evidence shines some light on future perspectives on the application of pericyclic reactions or the synthesis of biological active molecules. The findings demonstrated that the synthetic methodology works well for the preparation of heterocyclic substituted novel compounds that displayed interesting and promising activity against viruses and in particular against HPV. The results clearly showed that compound 232 was inefficient against herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. An exception emerged against HPV-11. Compound 232 showed an EC50 value <1 along with a CC50 value >100. The secondary screening demonstrated that compound 232 was found less effective in raft cultures than in primary assay in HEK 293 cells. The EC50/90 values are higher than those of the reference compound U0126, as well as the CC50 value. The SI50/90 values however are close to the reference.108\n",

Thus, after separation of the regioisomers, treatment with methanol saturated with ammonia in a sealed reacting vessel at 100\u00b0C led to the carboacyclic nucleoside 257. The carboacyclic nucleoside 258 was synthesized in 73% yield via treatment of 257 with CH3ONa/CH3OH at room temperature. Other compounds were prepared, but only compounds 157 and 258 have a low activity, in vitro, against parainfluenza virus type 3 and reovirus type 1, respectively (MIC50=240 \u03bcg/mL, MCC>400 \u03bcg/mL). Neither anti-HIV-1(IIIB) nor anti-HIV-2(ROD) activity was observed in MT-4 cells for the products at hand.116\n",

Some cellular activity was observed, which most likely implies that the compounds are able to penetrate into cells. Some of the synthesized compounds showed activities against several DNA viruses in the micromolar range. Whereas the 1,4-regioisomers exhibited antiviral activity, it is interesting to note that the (1,5)-regioisomers were found inactive against this wide panel of viruses and display no toxicity. In order to design compounds with a significantly increased potency, it will be necessary to study their phosphorylation by human and viral kinases; this process would be greatly aided by a cocrystal structure of the best compounds bound in the enzyme active sites. Also, it will be of interest to investigate the properties of their monophosphorylated derivatives against thymidylate synthase and their triphosphorylated derivatives against the viral and cellular DNA polymerases to reveal the mechanism of biological action.118 Copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azido-ristocetin aglycon and various propargyl glycosides were used to prepare new sugar derivatives of ristocetin.

The conjugates of phosphorylated lamivudine and dideoxycytidine (zalcitabine) showed higher potency than the parent nucleosides. The conjugate of phosphorylated azidothymidine (AZT) was less active against HIV-1 than the parent nucleoside probably because of the replacement of its 3\u2032-azido group by 1,2,3-triazole ring. These results show an opportunity for using SiO2 nanoparticles as a transport for delivering phosphorylated nucleosides to cells in order to increase their efficiency as antiviral and anticancer drugs.127 Nonobligate chain terminating nucleosides with a linear substituent (azido or ethynyl group) at the 4\u2032 position represent an important class of compounds in antiviral discovery, particularly against HCV and HIV. 3\u2032- AZT-derived 1,2,3-triazoles can be potent inhibitors of HIV-1. To gauge the medicinal chemistry impact of functionalizing the 4\u2032-linear substituent and possibly generate novel antiviral nucleoside scaffolds, azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions with 4\u2032-AZT were investigated.

Water-soluble tridecafullerenes decorated with 120 peripheral carbohydrate subunits, so-called superballs, were prepared through the collaboration of several European research groups and could be synthesized efficiently from hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene in one step by using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry (Fig. 1.15\n).\n",

Such analogs were modified in the carbohydrate portion of the molecule, the spacer, and in the base portion. Examination of molecular models suggested that a cyclobutane ring might serve as a surrogate for the oxetan ring of oxetanocin A. This observation led to the synthesis of the racemic carbocyclic analogs of oxetanocin A, compounds 302 and 303 that exhibited broad-spectrum activity against HSV and HIV (Scheme 1.55\n). They were considered promising agents for AIDS treatment.\n",

Some reported syntheses resort to a racemic or enantiomerically pure substituted cyclobutanone as the key intermediate. Furthermore, the nucleoside strategy may rely on a convergent synthesis or a linear approach. In Scheme 1.55, the 4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl) oxy)methyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one 299 was irradiated at 300 nm and the intermediate 300 was obtained as a result of a [2+2] photochemical ring closure. Synthetic elaboration of 300 led to the protected cyclobutane-amine 301 that is the starting point for the linear construction of adenine and guanine, respectively, to afford the compounds 302 and 303. This represents just a simple example of the way these compounds can be easily obtained; many other approaches are reported in literature, not only regarding the preparation of antiviral compounds but also for the synthesis of amino acids, peptides, and other biologically active molecules.139\n",
