The epidemiology of acute illness in elite level athletes has been studied in a variety of settings, mainly during major tournaments and in different sports including swimming, rugby and football [6]. Six to seventeen percent of registered athletes participating in major international games and tournaments of shorter duration (<4 weeks) are likely to suffer an acute illness episode. There are some data indicating that higher-risk subgroups are (1) female athletes, (2) athletes participating in winter sports (e.g. Olympic and Paralympic Games), (3) athletes with disability [7\u20139] and (4) athletes participating in more prolonged tournaments or competition [10]. Data from these studies consistently show that the most common system affected by acute illness is the respiratory tract, followed by the gastrointestinal system and the dermatological system [11, 12]. Scarce data exists on the incidence and aetiology of acute illness of athletes outside the major tournaments and competitions, i.e. in their home setting. Studies exclusively in football players show that the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are the most common systems affected by illness, during the studied tournaments. During the 2009 Confederations Cup, the incidence of illness was 16.9 per 1000 player days, with the respiratory tract (RT) accounting for over 50% of all illness (the ear, nose and throat = 37%; other respiratory tract = 20%) [12]. Similarly, during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, respiratory illness was the most common medical condition affecting football players (40% of all illness) [11].\n",

The main theory is that a transient or more prolonged immune depression postexercise may contribute to the pathophysiology and risk of acute illness [13\u201318]. Indeed, changes in a variety of immune system components following a single intensive exercise session have been observed. Postexercise immune changes may be most pronounced when the exercise session is >90-min long and the intensity is 55\u201375% of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2Max) [13], while other data indicate that a session longer than 60 min at an intensity >80% of maximum ability causes a depression in the immune system [19]. Observed changes include an increase in circulating neutrophils [3, 15, 20], a decrease in the lymphocytes [3, 15], a decrease in neutrophil function (oxidative activity and phagocytic capacity) for 1\u20133 days after the exercise session [3, 15, 17], a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell numbers and cytotoxic activity [3, 13] as well as a decrease in the salivary IgA concentrations [3, 17, 21]. Furthermore, there is an increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (used as a predictor of stress to the immune system) for most of the following days after a heavy exercise session [22]. A 20% reduction in plasma glutamine concentration may occur, while there is conflicting evidence regarding T-cell function [3, 23]. The existing studies are typically in endurance type of sports, while strength sports have been less studied, in this regard.",

This period is known as the \u201copen window\u201d and has been widely proposed to reflect a time of \u201cdysfunction\u201d of the immune system, during which the athlete may be predisposed to viral and bacterial infections [1, 3, 21, 23]. However, the clinical relevance of the observed changes is still debated. Despite evidence that certain immunologic parameters change after strenuous exercise sessions, there is a lack of evidence of a direct link between the altered immune parameters and an increased incidence for URT illness, postexercise [3, 13, 24, 25]. The reason for this lack of evidence may be that some of the observed changes are physiological, as part of the acute-phase (inflammatory) response to training [26]. In addition, it has also been shown that overtraining leads to immune suppression, which may render the athlete susceptible to an acute URT illness [19, 27]. Clinically, reports of elite athletes experiencing repeated colds could also be due to the fact that an elite athlete will be relatively more affected by an ordinary cold than the average person who has less demand on maximal performance in everyday life.\n",

An infection will result in different degrees of response from the immune system. The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre integrates afferent information from the periphery to regulate body temperature [43]. The core body temperature is normally kept within a range of 1\u201336.5\u201337.5 \u00b0C. Clinically, it is important to note that rectal temperatures are slightly higher than oral temperatures, with the difference being about 0.5\u00b0C. Women may have cyclic variations in their body temperature, in association with the menstrual phases. Fever is defined as a temperature that exceeds the normal and is accompanied by a shift in the thermoregulatory control. Exogenous pyrogens, such as microbial toxins or viruses, bind to macrophages and trigger the release of endogenous pyrogens (pyrogenic cytokines such as interleukins, TNF, IFN-\u03b1) [44]. Both types of pyrogens increase the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which acts on the hypothalamus, via cyclic AMP, to adjust the thermoregulation upwards. Although fever is a physiologic response to an infection, it could also be the result of other immune stimuli, such as inflammation, malignancy or haemorrhagic stroke.",

Myocarditis is typically associated with general symptoms such as malaise and tiredness. Dyspnoea, palpitations, chest pain or even sudden cardiac arrest, due to malignant arrhythmia, may also be present [51]. Pericarditis is a similarly acquired infection of the pericardium and is also a possible complication to exercise during an ongoing infection [52].\nRhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of skeletal muscle leading to compromised integrity of the muscle membrane, with subsequent leaking of the contents of the muscle cell into the plasma [4]. The myoglobin released from the muscle cells is filtered through the kidneys and excreted into the urine and can be directly toxic to the renal tubule and can lead to acute renal failure. It has been documented that the risk to develop rhabdomyolysis is increased when exercising during or after a viral illness [4].\n",

This means that the athlete should have no remaining muscle pain, general malaise, fever or specific symptoms of the disease (diarrhoea, etc.).Secondly, RTP is a gradual process. The athlete should be closely monitored and only be allowed to increase training load if he/she is symptom-free. The length of this adjustment period is dependent on the duration and severity of the infection.Importantly, the athlete should not be advised to exercise in an alternative fashion, i.e. strength training instead of endurance training, which has sometimes been considered to be a less demanding activity.

The most important preventative measure to stop transmission of URT is frequent handwashing [2, 5] and avoiding contact between the hands, eyes and nose, as this is a primary route of introducing viruses into the body [34]. Other measures include covering the mouth and nose with the cubital fossa (elbow pit) when sneezing or coughing [60], avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact [5] and avoiding contact with ill individuals [2, 34]. Sharing of water bottles, towels and sporting equipment should be strongly discouraged [2, 5]. Regarding infections spread by vectors (insects, mots), an additional advice is to wear clothing covering the arms and legs during training sessions when travelling in tropical areas, particularly at dusk and dawn. To wear open footwear when using public showers, swimming pools and locker rooms prevents dermatological infections. Individual strategies that facilitate good quality sleep such as napping during the day and correct sleep hygiene practices at night are recommended. Avoid excessive and binge drinking of alcohol, as this impairs immune function for several hours, particularly after strenuous training or competition.

Sports governing bodies have the responsibility to consider the competition load and hence the health of the athletes when planning their event calendars. This requires increased coordination between single- and multisport event organisers and the development of a comprehensive calendar of all international sports events. Psychological load (stressors) such as negative life event stress and daily hassles can significantly increase the risk of illness in athletes.
