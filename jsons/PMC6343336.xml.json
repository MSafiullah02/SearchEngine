            "text": "Babesiae are Apicomplexan parasites (order Piroplasmida; family Babesiidae) which infect the erythrocytes of birds and mammals [1]. Much like parasites of their sister order, Haemosporida (the causative agents of malaria), babesiae can induce disease, including anemia and haemoglobinuria, when replicating in the red blood cells of mammalian hosts [2]. Among these hosts, insectivorous bats infected with Babesia vesperuginis display elevated reticulocyte and white blood cell counts, lowered haemoglobin levels, and splenomegaly, as compared with uninfected individuals [3, 4]. Such reports are intriguing, given widespread debate in the literature as to the extent to which bats - the purportedly tolerant reservoirs for virulent zoonoses, such as Ebola, Nipah, and SARS [5] - experience pathology from any microparasitic infections [6]. Admittedly, most discussions of bat pathogen tolerance have been limited to Old World fruit bats [7, 8], distinct from the insectivorous bat hosts of B. vesperuginis. Babesia vesperuginis has been identified in bats across Europe [9\u201311], the Americas [12] and China [13, 14]; such widespread host and geographical ranges suggest, contrary to popular dogma, that infection-associated pathology is unlikely to be severe.",

Typically, babesiae are vectored by ixodid ticks, which acquire and transmit the piroplasmid during blood meals [1], though some have speculated (without confirmation) that the bat-specific soft tick, Argas vespertilionis, could act as a B. vesperuginis vector [3]. Studies of babesial infections in captive baboon populations suggest between-host transmission in the absence of available tick vectors, indicating that direct horizontal and/or vertical transmission may also be possible [16].",

Descriptions of erythrocytic protozoa in pteropodid bats have been instead restricted to the order Haemosporida [17\u201319]. Previous work on the island of Madagascar has documented insectivorous bat infections with microfilaria and with several hemoprotozoa (leucocytozoans, haemosporidians, and trypanosoma), but authors noted the absence of any blood parasites in two endemic Madagascan fruit bats (Eidolon dupreanum and Rousettus madagascariensis) [20, 21]. No previous study has examined hemoprotozoal infections of the Madagascan flying fox, Pteropus rufus, the largest of the three endemic pteropodids inhabiting the island and the focus of our work. We present evidence of babesial infection in the blood of P. rufus. We aimed to (i) identify and (ii) characterize these babesiae morphologically, phylogenetically and ecologically.",

Bats were captured in nine of twelve months of the year (except for April, June and October). Upon capture, bats were manually restrained, sexed, measured, weighed, and examined for ectoparasites. Between 0.4 to 1.0 ml of blood was drawn from the brachial vein of each captured individual, using a 1.0 ml insulin syringe. Blood specimens were centrifuged in the field, separated and stored in liquid nitrogen as blood clot and serum. Capillary tubes were used to collect blood from the puncture site for preparation of thin and thick-film blood smears. Blood smears were air-dried, fixed with absolute methanol and stored in a slide box containing desiccants. All captured bats were fed with sugar water post-processing and released alive at the site of capture the following evening.",

Because fruit bats birth in synchronous annual pulses [24], we obtained more precise estimates of age by assuming a standard birth date (October 1) for all P. rufus captured in our study; we computed ages for pups less than one year (cementum annuli = 0) in the same way. We added the duration of time between capture and birth date to the integer estimate of age via cementum annuli to compute age to the nearest day for 144 P. rufus (80 male, 64 female).",

Sequences were aligned under default parameters in the program MUSCLE [29], using Plasmodium falciparum as the outgroup, then trimmed to 572 bp to reflect the length of the shortest partial sequence in the dataset (from B. vesperuginis). Subsequent evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [30]: we identified the Tamura 3-parameter with Gamma distribution and invariable sites (TN92+G+I) model as the best-fit for the data (via BIC score) and constructed the corresponding phylogenetic tree using a Maximum Likelihood approach. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The resulting phylogenetic tree was inferred via complete gap deletion, for a total of 380 positions in the final database [31, 32].",

Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) suggests that observed Madagascan flying fox Babesia spp. fall within the monophyletic clade encompassing small-sized feline, rodent, primate and canid babesiae (the so-called \u2018Microti Group\u2019[1, 26, 27, 41]), distinct from B. vesperuginis sequences which, by contrast, clustered with Babesia spp. of the \u2018Duncani Group,\u2019 or \u2018Western clade\u2019 [42]. Because only partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene are currently available for B. vesperuginis, as well as for P. rufus genotypes and their closest matches in GenBank, phylogenetic inference across all clades was limited to a 573 bp fragment only (Fig. 3).",

Specifically, we describe infection of novel Babesia spp. genotypes in blood from the Madagascan flying fox Pteropus rufus. Notably, these new Babesia spp. cluster phylogenetically within the B. microti clade, aligning most closely with a Babesia sp. lineage reported from Madagascan lemurs [39], rather than with the bat-specific B. vesperuginis [10]. We documented slight genetic variation among our recovered sequences, though no compelling evidence of clearly distinct genotypes. Mixed infections of multiple species within a single host are common in piroplasmids generally [43, 44] but were not identified here. Classically, Babesia spp. have been subdivided morphologically into small and large groups [45, 46], although more recent analyses have relied on molecular methods to reclassify Babesia spp. in four-to-six major phylogenetic subclades, including the \u2018Microti Clade\u2019 highlighted here [1, 26, 27, 41]. Morphological observations of P. rufus babesiae further support their placement in the \u2018Microti Clade\u2019, in which the typical trophozoite appears rounded, with a diameter of 1\u20132.5 \u03bcm [2] and with chromatins in a variety of single, double and multiple dot forms that multiply as the trophozoite advances in life stage [47]. The tetrad replication structure (\u2018Maltese cross\u2019) observed in P. rufus babesiae is a characteristic feature of \u2018Microti Clade\u2019 infections [2].",

Ixodid ticks are present throughout Madagascar and known to infest a variety of host species, including lemurs in which babesial infections have been previously reported [49]. Pteropus rufus roost in trees that overlap lemur habitat [50], presenting opportunities for potential cross-species transmission by blood-feeding arthropods. Nonetheless, in 15 months of sampling, our field team failed to recover any ectoparasites from 203 captured P. rufus, despite successful collection of bat flies and fleas from other frugivorous bats sampled during this same period [38]. The arboreal lifestyle of P. rufus may subject the bats to environmental fluctuations and climatic instabilities that limit the extent of ectoparasite infestation, and it is possible that low prevalence ectoparasite infestations were simply missed. Ticks are known to switch among vertebrate hosts as they mature across advancing life stages [51], and their presence on any given species can be seasonal and brief. Previous studies of closely-related babesial infections in captive baboons also indicate that transmission and maintenance of these parasites may also be possible via horizontal or vertical mechanisms in the absence of available arthropod vectors [16].",

Our findings recapitulate much classic Babesia epidemiology from other systems. In particular, we uncovered evidence of seasonality in Babesia prevalence, with infection peaking during the wet season, a pattern consistent with the established literature [39, 52]. Additionally, we found that all bats identified as positive for babesial infection in our system were males, a sex-biased pattern also consistent with Babesia prevalence patterns reported in some other host systems [52\u201354]. This disparity may simply reflect a surface area effect in that larger-bodied individuals in this sexually size-dimorphic species [39, 55] have an elevated probability of ectoparasite infestation and corresponding infection risk, but could, likewise, result from true sex differences in immune function. Previous work has demonstrated that testosterone impairs both innate and acquired resistance to tick infestations in rodents and supports higher parasitemia and longer duration infections of B. microti in rodent hosts [56, 57].",

Our identification of the second-known lineage of bat-infecting babesiae therefore raises the question of its impact on bat health. The low infection rate recovered from our study precludes any sweeping inferences in this regard, though the nine babesiae-positive bats identified in our analysis appeared no less ostensibly \u2018healthy\u2019 than uninfected counterparts - and in fact, demonstrated higher average body mass for their size than did babesiae-negative individuals. As with male-biased infection, such results may simply reflect a surface area effect of higher probability of ectoparasite infestation and corresponding babesial infection in larger animals, but these findings could also indicate parasite preference for hosts better equipped to provide rich resource subsidies. In keeping with the lack of ostensible pathology, we observed no statistically significant differences in relative white blood cell counts between infected and uninfected hosts, although further sampling is needed to clarify whether babesial infection induces leukocytosis in P. rufus. The low number of infection-positive individuals recovered limited our inference in this regard. All told, categorical assessment of bat health was incomplete in our study, as no physiological assays were performed and no necropsies carried out on any sampled individuals (all bats were live-released following capture).",

Age-prevalence data were best fit by a compartmental transmission model incorporating susceptible-infectious (SI) transmission dynamics, by which hosts are born susceptible, then subjected to a constant (albeit low) force of infection across the duration of their lifespans. As with body condition, our inference must be tempered by the rarity of positive samples recovered in our dataset; however, these patterns support our other observations of the lack of any pathological effect of infection on host health. Such findings are consistent with reports of persistent, low parasitemia babesial infections which can establish for years in other hosts, including mice [58, 59], cattle [60], and even humans [61, 62] - but counter to the established dogma of pathology associated with B. vesperuginis infections in insectivorous bats [3]. Further research will be needed to clarify the true extent of pathogenicity for these parasites and determine whether these discrepancies, if genuine, reflect differences in the two different babesiae, their hosts (i.e. fruit bats versus insectivorous bats), or the timing of the parasite life-cycle during which sampling took place. In babesial infections of other hosts, long-term persistent infections can establish after control and survival of acute pathology [2, 63], meaning that sampling during only part of the parasite life-cycle could yield biased interpretations of virulence.",

Phylogenetic clustering of recovered sequences of Babesia spp. from P. rufus with primate Babesia spp. supports the potential for cross-species transmission, although the low prevalence and parasitemia observed in babesial infections of the Madagascan flying fox make P. rufus an unlikely candidate reservoir for human Babesia.
