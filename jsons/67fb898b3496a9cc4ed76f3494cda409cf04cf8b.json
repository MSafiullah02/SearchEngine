The potential for viral dissemination to health care providers during routine diagnostic endoscopy or definitive surgical procedures is of serious concern.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is unique in its location in the upper aerodigestive tract, a known location that harbors SARS-Cov2, the causative virus in COVID-19. Otolaryngologists and associated multidisciplinary team members caring for head and neck cancer patients are at heightened risk of transmission through mucus, blood, and aerosolized particles. A high rate of transmission to otolaryngologists has been reported in China, Italy, and Iran, with reports of morbidity and death [1] . The limited availability of COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), disposable medical supplies, hospital and ICU beds, ventilators, and ancillary staff force clinicians to triage which procedures are \"essential\" and which can be safely delayed. Healthcare providers who contract the virus have generally been mandated to self-quarantine, thereby reducing the availability of the hospital workforce. In the midst of the ongoing pandemic, patients diagnosed with HNSCC now have the added stress in how COVID-19 will impact their care and treatment. The current evidence supports that cancer patients have a higher risk of infection and serious complications from COVID-19 relative to other patient subgroups [2] . Uncertainties such as whether treatment will continue and how these high risk patients will continue to access services, are being addressed as the situation continues to evolve.",

The European Society of Surgical Oncology is also taking precautions: advising clinicians to not see patients over 70 years of age in the clinic unless urgent and discouraging surgery for benign diseases [5] . The Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery recommends that otolaryngologists use PAPR when performing urgent or emergent cases on COVID-19 positive patients, preferably in designated negative pressure operating rooms [6] . To maintain high standards in cancer care, physicians at the National Cancer Institute of Milan have launched a social media campaign to extend frequent COVID-19 testing to health care workers involved in the treatment of cancer patients [7] .",

            "text": "In Canada, Ontario Health Cancer Care Ontario (OH-CCO) put forth Pandemic Planning Clinical Guideline for Patients with Cancer to provide recommendations for a systematic approach in assigning priority for consultation and treatment of cancer patients during a pandemic. The guidelines propose using a priority classification (A, B, or C) to stratify cancer patients based on need and efficacy of treatment, which will dictate the terms under which they are treated, where they are treated, and when they are treated. For head and neck cancer patients, the ethical responsibility to evaluate and categorize them based on the two aforementioned criteria rests with the surgical oncologist, often in consultation with other providers. Priority A encompasses those who are in critical condition (unstable, unbearable suffering, and/or whose condition is immediately life threatening) and for whom there is effective treatment. These patients require immediate medical attention to initiate or continue treatment. Priority B determines those who are in a non-life threatening state and therefore can have their services deferred without undue risk during a wave of the pandemic event. Priority C determines those who are undergoing routine follow-up or screening and can reasonably wait until the pandemic is over. The priority classification can be employed to determine which patients would most benefit from palliative care symptom management, radiation, surgery, and systemic therapy during a pandemic [12] .",

The key messages, supported by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), state that radiotherapy should be delivered at the earliest opportunity if the treatment is curative. For head and neck cancer, there is evidence that a 16% increased risk of death exists for every month of delay of radiotherapy [20] . If disease biology permits postponement, then deferring treatment until an expected decline in COVID-19 cases is reasonable. For individuals on active treatment diagnosed with COVID-19, the decision to delay or modify treatment should be individualized based on the overall goals of treatment, the patient's current oncologic status and medical comorbidities, and treatment tolerance. A risk-benefit analysis is warranted if radiotherapy is offered as an adjunct to prior surgery, as patients who can expect only modest benefit in terms of long-term survival gains may desire to avoid therapy during the pandemic. For patients receiving treatment for palliation, the recommendation is to exhaust all other options, such as maximizing analgesia, prior to pursuing radiotherapy. Furthermore, most patients who have recently completed radiotherapy may have their follow-up appointments safely delayed by two or more months, with telemedicine as needed [21] [22] .",
