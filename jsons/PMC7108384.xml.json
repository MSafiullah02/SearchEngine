It has become increasingly important in the USA, where, since 1980, as many as 1494 cases of NC have been diagnosed [3]. In non-Islamic developing countries, NC is the major cause of late onset epilepsy, which seriously degrades human's activities, when not treated (Meinardi in Pawlowski et al. [4]). Neurocysticercosis is a preventable infection, but scientific interest has tended to focus more on the clinical aspects of this disease than on its prevention.",

Without safe and effective taenicides being available, successful control of NC in Europe took several decades and it was achieved mainly by rigorous meat inspection, improved sanitation, better health education and higher living standards. Introduction of safe and effective taenicides in 1960s and 1970s has introduced the potential role of chemotherapy in control programs [4]. Some problems related to taking a practical advantage of these taenicides are discussed here.",

In treating hundreds of T. saginata carriers since 1952, male fern extract was used only sporadically, due to fatal cases of intoxication being reported. In the 1950s, there was no other choice in Poland than to try pumpkinseeds (163 patients were treated with 60\u201365% cure rate). The seeds were replaced in the late 1950s by atabrine or an acridine derivative\u2014Acranil given per os (respectively, 44 and 89 patients treated with 42% and 88% cure rate). Later, metallic tin compounds became available (226 patients \u2014 88% cured) but then discontinued after reports of toxicity [7]. Then the time \u201cworm cure without tears\u201d arrived when niclosamide was introduced in the 1960, followed by praziquantel a decade later. With these safe taenicides, a high cure rate, respectively 80% and 90%, was achieved in hundreds of T. saginata carriers; it is generally accepted that T. saginata tapeworm is more resistant to anthelmintics than T. solium\n[8].",

From the outset, it was known that the efficacy of niclosamide was highly dependent on its particle size (< 1 \u03bcm). Later, it was observed that some generic products are less effective than the original ones and that niclosamide may loose efficacy during storage, probably due to polymerisation of its active particles. The production of niclosamide was much reduced in 1990s, whilst praziquantel increasingly became the taenicide of choice since it was at least 5\u00d7 cheaper per treatment. The interest in niclosamide may soon return since it has been recently shown to inhibit the replication of SARS corona viruses [12].",

This process can be accelerated by various factors, including the use of taenicides such as praziquantel, which is absorbed and partly pass the blood\u2013brain barrier. In fact, possible induction of symptomatic NC by using a single dose of praziquantel has been reported [13]. This phenomenon is probably related to the individual variability of praziquantel concentration in serum and in brain tissue, but it is rare. Symptoms possibly related to activation of cysticercosis were observed in one person among 10,173 people treated with praziquantel in Ecuador [14]. No such cases were observed during mass treatment of schistosomiasis with larger doses of praziquantel in Africa. Therefore, the risk of inducing symptomatic cysticercosis, as an adverse effect of treatment with a single dose of praziquantel, cannot be a reason to limit the use of praziquantel in taeniasis, but should be rather accepted as a calculated infrequent \u201cprice to be paid\u201d for treating a T. solium tapeworm carrier, being a potential source of NC. Praziquantel remains contraindicated in ocular cysticercosis at any dose.",

This will be very difficult to achieve with NC even in limited areas. Eradication is meant as a permanent reduction to zero the worldwide incidence of a specific infection.

This has to be supported by health education and wider availability of diagnostic tools. Interventions, which reduce pig cysticercosis, such as sanitation, pigs chemotherapy, vaccination, meat inspection are auxiliary measures, which may make a success of control by chemotherapy of the carriers quicker and more permanent.

            "text": "Two vertical strategies of the control measures were defined at a PAHO meeting in 1990 [23], namely a long-term and a short-term strategy. The long-term strategy, usually a nationwide, is designed to act over decades and depends on steady improvements in the quality of medical and veterinary services, health education, economy and legislation. Its coordination requires an administrative body. A short-term strategy was developed to allow for local urgency and severity of NC problem in some regions. It is designed to act over years and in restricted areas and requires mobilization of local public health, medical and veterinary services. The third alternative strategy, recently suggested [4], is a horizontal approach by incorporation of simple control measures into the existing health services activities, by given them instructions and diagnostic and therapeutic control tools. Which strategy is accepted and how it would be implemented and monitored depends again on local endemic situation and local control abilities.",

The diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods is low: questioning for expulsion a tapeworm \u2013 about 50%, finding tapeworm proglottids or Taenia spp. eggs in faeces \u2013 30\u201350% each. Only the coproantigen tests offer the sensitivity close to 100%. It may not differentiate T. solium from other Taenia spp. but this is not a critical point because any tapeworm in humans deserves to be eliminated for medical or epidemiological reasons. The coproantigen tests are stable and can be easily distributed, stored and do not request any specific equipment to be performed (Allan in Pawlowski et al. [4]). Coproantigen tests may be very useful in diagnosing individual Taenia carriers in hospitals or as outpatients as well as in screened populations e.g., in rural areas or military units [24]. A cost of the test could be low at a larger scale production. However, their availability is limited as in endemic regions there are only a few specialised laboratories, which can undertake commercial production of such a test, in cooperation with and supervision of some existing scientific reference centers (Allan in Pawlowski et al. [4]).",

This is mainly due to poor treatment coverage, human migration and/or infected pigs and eggs in the environment acting as a reservoir of infection [25]. Experience with a single mass treatment of the population in endemic Andean areas in Ecuador was also not very encouraging [14]. However, these studies demonstrated the focality of taeniasis, later confirmed in several other studies. In the Andean region, where over 11,000 persons were treated in 26 localities, there were 5 localities without any T. solium carriers, 16 localities having 0.1% to 5.0% of population infected with T. solium and 5 localities with the prevalence of T. solium carriers between 7.1% and 21.1% [14]. Treatment of the whole population, eventually repeated, was fully justified only in the last group of localities.",
