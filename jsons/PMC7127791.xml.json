            "text": "Emerging and re-emerging viruses are capable of rapidly overcoming their natural geographical boundaries and spreading among the human population. Most of these viral outbreaks are due to zoonotic viruses, some of which were previously unknown.1, 2 With an increasing risk for vector-borne outbreaks, the Bunyaviridae present a particular and global threat to public health. Members of this virus family are the cause of Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas and Schmallenberg virus-induced congenital malformations in ruminants, which emerged in Europe in 2011. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by the SFTS virus. In addition, some well-known Bunyaviruses like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus continue to emerge in new geographical locations.3, 4 RVFV is transmitted by a wide variety of mosquitoes and its geographic distribution is expanding, with the potential of reaching Europe in the near future. This virus causes devastating epidemics in Africa and Arabia, killing hundreds of humans and thousands of wild and livestock animals. The transmission of Bunyaviruses, and their cell entry pathways and cell receptors remain poorly characterized, partly due to the fact that experiments with wild-type RVFV are limited to enhanced biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, which are very few in number.5 The lack of vaccines and antiviral medications makes the potential spread of these Bunyaviruses a global concern. Recently, in an effort to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for RVFV treatment, the anticancer drug sorafenib was found to be an effective inhibitor of RVFV replication.6 Another agent that is able to suppress RVFV replication in cell culture is the polyanionic drug suramin.4, 7\n",

It is an exceptionally simple and straightforward acid-catalyzed one-pot cyclocondensation reaction of ethylacetoacetate (1), aldehyde (2) and urea (3) that affords 4-substituted 3,4-dihydropyrimidine-2-ones (DHPM) or Biginelli compounds.8 A number of variations to give higher yields and expand the scope versus the traditional three-component Biginelli condensation, resulted in many simple derivatives that emerged as promising therapeutic agents. Monastrol was discovered as a prototype anti-cancer drug that inhibits the mitotic kinesin-5 protein.9 Methyl 4-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-6-methyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate (HAP-1) and its derivatives were developed as anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents targeting viral capsid assembly.10 Moreover, marine alkaloids Crambescidins and Crambescins containing an DHPM core and isolated from the sponges Crambe crambe and Batzella sp. were demonstrated to possess antiviral and cytotoxic properties.11 Batzelladines A and B with DHPM core were identified as inhibitors of HIV gp-120 binding to CD4 receptors (Fig. 1\n).12 However, the majority of studies exclude or limit the aliphatic aldehydes within their scope due to their troublesome behavior and unacceptable yield in this multi-component reaction.13, 14 It is still desirable to optimize this reaction while employing aliphatic aldehydes.",

The results of the evaluation in Vero cell cultures are presented in Table 1\n. Compound 4m was found to be a selective and potent inhibitor of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Phlebovirus. 4m was approximately 7 times more potent than the viral entry inhibitor dextran sulphate (DS-10000) and broad-spectrum acting mycophenolic acid (an inhibitor of the cellular IMP dehydrogenase). Compared to the broad antiviral agent ribavirin, 4m proved 17 times more potent with superior activity (EC50 value of 3 \u03bcM) and a selectivity index (ratio of 50% cytotoxic concentration to 50% effective antiviral concentration) of \u2a7e33. The anti-PTV effect of 4m was dose-dependent achieving 81% protection against virus-induced CPE at 20 \u03bcM of compound. Since PTV is related to the most clinically relevant Phlebovirus RVFV,19 we next evaluated the effect of 4m against RVFV. This virus is classified as a BSL-4 virus,20, 21 and we therefore used the low-pathogenic MP-12 strain. Although about 40% reduction in RVFV-induced CPE was seen at a compound concentration of 100 \u03bcM, 4m was unable to achieve 50% inhibition at this high concentration (data not shown). Also, when evaluated against PTV in HeLa cells, 4m was found to be inactive, which contrasts to the marked effect seen in Vero cells (see above). Hence, the antiviral effect of 4m appears to be cell-dependent, alike what was described for the anti-Ebola virus activity of brincidofovir, an antiviral drug with a lipophilic moiety that is structurally similar to that of 4m.22\n",

Some amphiphilic molecules with a large polar head group (inverted-cone-shaped) are known to target viral membranes and display broad-spectrum antiviral activity.23 However, except for Punta Toro virus, 4m did not have antiviral activity against all other viruses tested. This molecule displayed only modest cytotoxicity (Table 2\n), with a minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of 100 \u03bcM in Vero and human embryonic lung (HEL) cells, and no toxicity at 100 \u03bcM compound concentration in the other cell lines tested. Human MT4 T-lymphoblast cells were an exception with a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 50 \u03bcM. Of the other DHPM compounds tested, none had noticeable antiviral activity. Compound 4h had marginal activity against varicella zoster virus (EC50 of 57 \u03bcM and MCC of 100 \u03bcM). Compounds 4b, 4c and 4d displayed no antiviral activity yet some cytotoxicity in MT-4 cells.",

Ethyl 6-methyl-2-oxo-4-undecyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5-pyrimidinecarboxylate (4m) displayed selective and potent antiviral activity against Punta Toro virus. Based on these first results, further evaluation of 4m against other Bunyaviruses (such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus) is warranted. Also, mechanistic studies are underway to understand the biochemical basis for its antiviral effect against Punta Toro virus.",
