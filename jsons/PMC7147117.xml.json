Thus, transport of sugars across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm is an essential cell biochemical function that relies on numerous sugar\u2010specific transport systems (L. Q. Chen, Cheung, Feng, Tanner, & Frommer, 2015; Cirillo, 1961; Reinhold & Kaplan, 1984). Escherichia coli is a gram\u2010negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium, which is one of the most important organisms for metabolic engineering because of its rapid growth, the hereditary information, and the well\u2010developed genetic tools available (Pontrelli et al., 2018). Given the widespread interests in biotechnological applications, sugar uptake routes in E. coli have been intensively investigated (Luo, Zhang, & Wu, 2014). However, the sugar transporters with broad sugar profiles are still unavailable.",

            "text": "Sugar transport involves active and passive mechanisms. Active transport requires metabolic energy for passage of molecules across the plasma membrane against a concentration gradient, whereas passive transport moves molecules from a higher to lower concentrations without the need for energy input. Passive transport can also be classified as facilitated diffusion and free diffusion. Active transport and facilitated diffusion are dependent on specific molecular binding between cargo and transporter, exhibiting substrate stereospecificity, nonlinear kinetics, and competitive inhibition (Cirillo, 1961). Moreover, many sugars are taken up with concomitant phosphorylation via the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS), which may cause carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and lead to diauxic cell growth on sugar mixtures (St\u00fclke & Hillen, 1999). In contrast, free diffusion is non\u2010mediated transport with a rate linear and in proportion to the difference in concentrations of the cargo. However, only small non\u2010polar molecules such as carbon dioxide and oxygen are believed to freely diffuse through plasma membranes (Zhao et al., 2011). Although many sugars are transported passively, no sugars are known to enter the cells via free diffusion.",

            "text": "Protein translocation channels are structurally conserved protein\u2010conducting systems that allow polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into cell membranes (Mandon, Trueman, & Gilmore, 2009; Osborne, Rapoport, & Van den Berg, 2005; Rapoport, 2007). In bacteria, these channels are formed by the SecY complex (SecYEG) and located in the plasma membrane (Akimaru, Matsuyama, Tokuda, & Mizushima, 1991; Breyton, Haase, Rapoport, K\u00fchlbrandt, & Collinson, 2002; Brundage, Hendrick, Schiebel, Driessen, & Wickner, 1990). X\u2010ray crystallography revealed that the SecY channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow central constriction consisting of six hydrophobic amino acid residues termed the pore ring, and the exofacial side of the channel is occluded by a short \u03b1\u2010helical segment called the plug domain (Figure 1a; Van den Berg et al., 2004). The SecY plug domain serves as a physical barrier that ensures that the channel is sealed in its resting state (W. Li et al., 2007). During translocation, the plug is displaced by the incoming polypeptide from the center of the channel to an open position (L. Li et al., 2016; Tam, Maillard, Chan, & Duong, 2005), and the pore ring forms a \u201cgasket\u2010like\u201d seal around the polypeptide chain (Park & Rapoport, 2011), preventing permeation by other molecules. Interestingly, although deletion of the plug in E. coli leads to membrane leakage (Park & Rapoport, 2011), it only causes a relatively minor growth defect (W. Li et al., 2007; Park & Rapoport, 2011), which may be because the hydrophobic nature of the pore ring can still provide a barrier for certain molecules (Park & Rapoport, 2011). These findings prompted us to hypothesize that SecY may be permeabilized and used as a free diffusion channel for sugars, offering a new paradigm for sugar uptake and addressing problems encountered with native sugar\u2010specific transporters.",

Chen, Chiang, Wang, Lee, & Chao, 2011; Joung, Kurumbang, Sang, & Oh, 2011; Figure 2a), the cell growth defects were not observed (Figure 2b). In contrast, the limitation of growth on glucose caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We reasoned that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma membrane due to its small V\nA (\u2248 0.178 m3/kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D\nAB \u2248 1.009 \u00d7 10\u20139 m2/s; Table 1; Wilke & Chang, 1955), and we confirmed diffusion by [14C]\u2010labeled glucose transport assay (Figure 3). To further enhance glucose uptake, SCVE was co\u2010expressed in the E. coli outer membrane (Figure 2a), which can permeabilize outer membranes of E. coli cells by forming transmembrane pores (Liao, Lescar, Tam, & Liu, 2004). This reduced permeation barrier of the outer membrane might increase the glucose concentration in the periplasm, thus increasing the glucose gradient across the SecY (\u0394P) channel, accelerating glucose diffusion into the cytoplasm (Figure 3), and increasing E. coli (\u0394PtsG) growth on glucose (Figure 2b). The glucose PTS catalyzes transport with concomitant phosphorylation of glucose to glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate. Therefore, once glucose is inside the mutant E. coli cells, phosphorylation might become the factor limiting glycolytic flux (Hern\u00e1ndez\u2010Montalvo et al., 2003), explaining the full recovery of E. coli (\u0394PtsG) growth on glucose with overexpression of an E. coli glucokinase (Glk; Fukuda, Yamaguchi, Shimosaka, Murata, & Kimura, 1983) together with SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE (Figure 2b). We compared the Monod growth kinetic parameters of E. coli (\u0394PtsG) co\u2010expressing SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Glk with those of the wild\u2010type strain (Figure 2c). Both strains had a maximum specific growth rate (\u03bc\nmax) of 0.347 hr\u22121, but the half\u2010saturation constant (K\nS) of the mutant strain (\u2248 4.803 mM) was 0.49\u2010fold higher than that of the wild\u2010type E. coli (\u2248 3.234 mM), indicating that the SecY (\u0394P) channel had a lower affinity for glucose than the glucose PTS.",

E. coli with damaged fructose PTS (\u0394FruA; Ferenci & Kornberg, 1974) or mannose PTS (\u0394ManXYZ; Erni & Zanolari, 1985) did not grow on fructose (Figure 4a) or mannose (Figure 4c), respectively. In contrast, SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE were found to help both mutant strains, especially those on mannose, recover growth. Co\u2010expression of an E. coli fructo(manno)kinase (Mak) that catalyzes phosphorylation of fructose or mannose in the cytoplasm (Sproul, Lambourne, Jean\u2010Jacques, & Kornberg, 2001) allowed the FruA\u2010lacking strain to grow on fructose at a similar rate as that of wild\u2010type E. coli (Figure 4a). Growth of the strain without ManXYZ on mannose was even faster than that of the control (Figure 4c), suggesting that fructose or mannose imported by the SecY (\u0394P) channel satisfied demands of the cells. Here, it should be noted that fructose taken up via the fructose PTS is phosphorylated to fructose\u20101\u2010phosphate before phosphorylation to fructose\u20101,6\u2010bisphosphate (Kornberg, 2001). However, in the route established in this study, the phosphorylated fructose first appeared inside the cell as fructose\u20106\u2010phosphate (Figure 1b), which accords with use of the PtsG\u2010F transporter (Kornberg, Lambourne, & Sproul, 2000). The growth kinetics in Figure 4b,d show that co\u2010expression of SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Mak conferred almost the same \u03bc\nmax values (0.248 hr\u22121 on fructose and 0.398 hr\u22121 on mannose) on the mutant E. coli as those of the wild\u2010type strain. Also, as in the case of glucose, the SecY (\u0394P) channel exhibited a lower affinity for fructose (K\nS \u2248 1.579 mM) and mannose (K\nS \u2248 4.719 mM) than for the fructose PTS (K\nS \u2248 0.843 mM) and mannose PTS (K\nS \u2248 3.181 mM).",

The main transporters for xylose (XylFGH; Sumiya, Davis, Packman, McDonald, & Henderson, 1995) and arabinose (AraFGH, AraE; Schleif, 2000) in E. coli were deleted independently; thus, the obtained strains either did not grow on xylose (Figure 5a) or arabinose (Figure 5c) as the sole carbon source. As expected, co\u2010expression of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE fully supported the growth of mutants. The lag phases of both mutant strains were shortened when compared with wild\u2010type E. coli, as was the case with mannose (Figure 4c). Interestingly, previous work showed that a mutant glucose facilitator protein (2\u2010RD5) from Zymomonas mobilis in E. coli allowed rapid transport of xylose but also caused an extensive growth delay (Ren, Chen, Zhang, Liang, & Lin, 2009). A prolonged lag phase (\u2248 25 hr) on arabinose was also observed when we re\u2010expressed AraFGH together with SCVE in E. coli (\u0394AraFGH, \u0394AraE; Figure 5e), even though AraFGH is regarded as an efficient system for arabinose uptake (Luo et al., 2014). Use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel did not seem to facilitate the initiation of the arabinose\u2010inducible promoter P\nBAD (Desai & Rao, 2010; Figure 5f), which controls synthesis of key enzymes (AraBAD) in the arabinose metabolism pathway in E. coli (Schleif, 2000). Therefore, we suspect that the SecY (\u0394P) channel transports other small nutritional molecules, allowing the cells to adapt to the growth conditions more quickly than the wild\u2010type strain at the beginning of fermentation. The mutant strain expressing SecY (\u0394P) with SCVE showed a \u03bc\nmax of 0.258 hr\u22121 on xylose (Figure 5b) and 0.388 hr\u22121 on arabinose (Figure 5d), which were almost identical to those of the wild\u2010type E. coli. The K\nS values for the mutant strains were 3.449 and 2.066 mM on xylose and arabinose, respectively, whereas, for wild\u2010type E. coli, the values were 1.489 and 1.831 mM.",

The LacY transporter (Abramson et al., 2003) was deleted from E. coli and thus the mutant strain could not grow on lactose as the sole carbon source (Figure 6a). However, the growth of E. coli (\u0394LacY) was slow after co\u2010expression of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE, probably because the larger molecular volume of lactose (V\nA \u2248 0.340 m3/kmol) led to a lower diffusion coefficient (D\nAB \u2248 0.684 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2/s) than the coefficient for monosaccharides (V\nA \u2264 0.178 m3/kmol, D\nAB \u2265 1.009 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2/s) (Table 1), resulting in reduced sugar flux through the pore ring of SecY (\u0394P). We then replaced the isoleucines (molecular weight Mr \u2248 131.18 g/mol) in the pore ring with glycines (Mr \u2248 75.07 g/mol) to enlarge the channel opening (Figure 6b). As illustrated in Figure 6c, glycine substitutions at Ile 191 and Ile 408 (SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG)) provoked a 1.27\u2010fold increase in permeation rate of 2\u2010NBDG, which has almost the same V\nA and D\nAB as those of lactose (Table 1). With co\u2010expression of SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG) and SCVE, E. coli (\u0394LacY) exhibited moderate growth on lactose, 50 hr after cell inoculation (Figure 6a). It is interesting that the SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG)\u2010engineered E. coli (\u0394LacY) was able to grow with a rate almost similar to the wild\u2010type after 160 hr. The possible reason is that wild\u2010type E. coli may have other unknown systems that can transport lactose in addition to LacY, but these systems have extremely low expression levels when the wild\u2010type E. coli grows on lactose. In this case, the engineered channel allows moderate growth of E. coli (\u0394LacY), offering a prerequisite for adaption. After a long\u2010term cultivation, other endogenous transport systems for lactose may be activated.",

            "text": "Sugar passage via specific transporters exhibits nonlinear kinetics as the external sugar content increases, demonstrating transport saturation (Cirillo, 1961). Large sugar gradients across a cell membrane can even inhibit growth. As shown in Figure 7a\u2013c, the specific growth rates of E. coli at 50, 100, and 150 g/L of glucose were 0.137, 0.127, and 0.036 hr\u20131, whereas the rates of E. coli (\u0394PtsG) with SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Glk were 0.175, 0.228, and 0.103 hr\u20131, respectively. This indicates that the use of SecY (\u0394P) channel can probably reduce the effects of transport saturation and increase the tolerance of E. coli for glucose, thereby improving cell growth at high sugar levels. Moreover, Figure 7d and e suggest that the modified SecY (\u0394P) channel reduced competitive inhibition of glucose transport in E. coli by glucose analogs methyl\u2010\u03b1\u2010d\u2010glucoside (\u03b1\u2010MG) and 2\u2010deoxy\u2010d\u2010glucose (2\u2010DG). When simultaneous utilization of mixed monosaccharides by the channel\u2010engineered E. coli was tested, we found that wild\u2010type E. coli exhibited CCR when grown in the presence of glucose and xylose, as expected (Figure 7f). Previous efforts have revealed that the PTS for the preferred carbon source plays a major role in CCR regulation (Deutscher, Francke, & Postma, 2006; Gorke & St\u00fclke, 2008). However, deletion of the glucose PTS can lead to reduced glucose uptake (Kim et al., 2015; Figure 7g). Our results show that replacing the glucose PTS with SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Glk enabled E. coli cells to simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose (Figure 7h) to overcome CCR. In addition, the consumption of both sugars accelerated compared with that of non\u2010channel\u2010engineered E. coli (\u0394PtsG), with a specific growth rate that increased from 0.174 to 0.309 hr\u20131.",
