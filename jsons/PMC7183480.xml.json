            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) serves as a major threat to the worldwide poultry industry, and it is a disease endemic to Jordan, causing respiratory, renal, and reproductive problems in chickens [1,2]. IB virus (IBV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the Coronavirinae subfamily gamma-coronaviruses [3]. IBV was first recognized as an avian respiratory pathogen in 1930, and its genetic diversity has resulted in the introduction of many IBV vaccines [4]. Recently, emerging IBV variants have been reported to cause nephropathogenic and reproductive problems, which are a turn of events that require a dramatic change in vaccination programs [5,6].",

The spike glycoprotein gene, encoding spike protein subunit 1 (S1) and 2 (S2), is the most variable gene in the IBV genome [8,9]. In particular, the S1 protein, which is responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells, differs significantly with regard to amino acid sequence among IBV serotypes [10]. This variability makes the S1 gene an ideal target in viral typing assays incorporating reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques. In most cases, high S1 gene homology between two strains can predict the occurrence of cross-protective immunity, where exposure to one strain confers protection to another [10-12].",

The first published study to use HRM analysis to the type of IBV strains was carried out in Australia, where an HRM assay that targeted the 3\u2019UTR gene was performed on local IBV vaccine and field strains [16]. Of the 17 IBV-positive cases, only 12 were typed correctly with matching HRM/3\u2019UTR and S1 gene sequencing results [16]. As can be seen, our HRM assay can type any Mass or 4/91 IBV vaccine and field strain correctly to their corresponding cluster. However, a problem is only encountered when dealing with IBV variant II field strain. In such cases, we might need to confirm the results of the HRM assay by sequencing of the S1 gene.",
