            "text": "\uf0b7 A laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2 was established \uf0b7 It consists of minipool testing of nucleic acid preparations \uf0b7 Limit of detection was 48 copies per reaction (95% confidence interval: 33 -184) \uf0b7 A protocol was distributed among five German university hospitals J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \uf0b7 The approach proved its principle and one COVID-19 case was detected in 70 minipools Abstract: Background: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in late 2019 and subsequently caused a pandemic. Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. Objectives: We aimed to provide a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2. Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. Results: We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020-10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-COV-2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: Our approach of a laboratory-based surveillance for SARSCoV-2 using minipools proved its concept is easily adaptable and resource-saving. It might assist not only public health laboratories in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Investigation, Formal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Early case detection is crucial to contain the pandemic and symptom-based case definitions have been set up in many countries worldwide. However, there is evidence that transmission chains can be initiated by asymptomatic cases or only mildly diseased COVID-19 patients (2) . These cases will be missed by currently recommended symptom-based case definitions and may lead to unrecognized local spread, which has been seen in Italy, Iran and more recently in the US. To limit the pandemic an aggressive public health response has been set up in many countries worldwide. However, a resurgence of cases is anticipated whenever the strict public health isolation measures will be lifted. Therefore, one of the biggest challenges and unresolved issues for public health will be the surveillance and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the time between epidemic peaks.",

In a first step, we analyzed the impact of minipool (MP) testing in batches of 10 samples per pool. Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u00b5l respiratory specimen (pharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium, sputum, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid) using the MinElute Virus kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on the QIAcube system as recommended. Elution was done in a volume of 100 \u00b5l. For setting up MP, 5 \u00b5l of each individual NA preparation was combined in pools of 10 (dilution factor of 10). We retrieved 40 left-over NA preparations of respiratory samples from 2019 representing a variety of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses from our local biobank in Freiburg and set up MP. We tested four MP using the same RT-PCR as for individual patient testing as described (3) . To exclude possible unspecific reactions of the MP procedure these MP were also tested using the SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time RT-PCR as described below. To determine the analytical sensitivity of the MP approach, we used in vitrotranscribed RNA standards for the E gene obtained by the European virus archive global (EVAg), https://www.european-virus-archive.com, and the SARS-CoV-2 E gene RT-PCR assay as described (4) . RT-PCR was done on an ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). We spiked different in vitro-transcribed RNA concentrations in stored NA preparations of respiratory samples from 2019 and established MP. Replicate testing was done to determine the limit of detection (LOD) as described (4) . Finally, we used NA preparations from three actual SARS-CoV-2 cases in Freiburg (containing 4x10 4 copies/ml; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3.2x10 7 copies/ml; 1.6x10 7 copies/ml, respectively) and set up three MP each containing one SARS-CoV-2 positive NA preparation and retested these samples.",

The availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics for early case detection is instrumental in an outbreak scenario (6) . From a public health perspective an easy to establish and cost effective laboratory-based screening strategy may assist in rapid case detection, surveillance and ultimately in a better understanding of this epidemic (7) . Technically, this can be done in parallel using samples from routine diagnostics which are subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (8). However, with the circulation of influenza cases across Europe merging with the upsurge of SARS-CoV-2 many laboratories may lack the capacity and resources to perform additional single patient sample testing for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a shortage of PCR reagents has become an issue of concern as huge numbers of additional SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests are performed globally in a relatively short period of time. To minimize work load, resources and costs a pooling approach of nucleic acid extractions might be considered.",

Another study of only mildly disease patients showed an average of 3,4x10 5 copies per swab.

We prospectively analyzed 42 MP comprising 420 samples using the SARS-CoV-2 E gene assay.
