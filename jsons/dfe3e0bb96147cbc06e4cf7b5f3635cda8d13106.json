We enrolled only hospitalized Caucasian patients with COVID-19 for whom the 35 final outcome was available. For each patient, age, sex, underlying comorbidities, 36 immunosuppressive therapies and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for 37 the analysis. These independent variables were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression 38 model to extract the predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. 39 Results: 302 Caucasian patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In the 40 multivariable logistic regression model, only Brixia score, patient age, and conditions that induced 41 immunosuppression were the significant predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. On receiver 42 operating characteristic curve analyses, the optimal cutoff values for Brixia score and patient age 43 were 8 points and 71 years, respectively. Three different models that included the Brixia score 44 showed excellent predictive power. 45 Conclusions: Patients with high Brixia score and at least one other predictive factor had the highest 46 risk of in-hospital death. 47 48 Key words 49 SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Scoring System 50 51 102 103 Discussion 104",

Presently, more than 200 54 countries, territories or areas are affected by this novel infectious disease (World Health recent estimates of mortality rate for COVID-19 (Baud et al., 2020), clinicians should be aware of 58 the risk factors associated with a fatal outcome. The literature reports that an older age, presence of 59 underlying comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), certain 60 laboratory parameters, and severity of lung abnormalities are associated with an increased risk of 61 mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ruan et al., 2020; Wang et al, 2020a; Yuan et al., 62 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). To improve the risk stratification of infected patients, we have introduced 63 in clinical practice a new chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system for quantifying and monitoring the 64 severity of lung abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 (Borghesi and Maroldi, 2020). This CXR scoring system (named Brixia score) grading the lung abnormalities due to COVID-19 on an 18-66 point severity scale(Borghesi and Maroldi, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, the predictive 67 value of a CXR scoring system in patients with COVID-19 has not yet been studied. Therefore, this 68 study aimed to investigated the usefulness of our CXR scoring system to predict the risk of in-69 hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Patients with 76 incomplete information about the presence of underlying comorbidities and immunosuppressive 77 therapies were excluded from the study. For each included patient, only the CXR report with the 78 highest score was considered for analysis. Each frontal chest projection linked to these reports was 79 independently reviewed by a thoracic radiologist (A.B. who had 15 years of experience in thoracic 80imaging) who reassigned the Brixia score.
