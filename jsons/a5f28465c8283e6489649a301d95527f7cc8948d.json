Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have taken up antigens become activated and start migrating towards nearby lymph nodes.

It comprises B and T lymphocytes both bearing antigen-specifi c receptors. The adaptive immune system can be divided into humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (see Fig. 22 .4 and Table 22 .3 ). The humoral response results in antibody formation (but contains cell-mediated events, see Fig. 22 .4 , panels a, b); CMI results in the generation of cytotoxic cells (see Fig. 22 .4 , panels a, c). The action of antibodies and T cells is dependent on accessory factors, some of which are mentioned in Table 22 .3 . In general, after infection with a pathogen or a protective vaccine, both humoral and cellular responses are generated. This indicates that both are needed for effi cient protection. The balance between humoral and cellular responses, however, can differ widely between pathogens and is dependent on how the pathogen is presented to the adaptive immune system by APCs. This may have consequences for the design of a particular vaccine (see \" Vaccine Design in Relation with the Immune Response \"). Antibodies are the typical representatives of humoral immunity. An antibody belongs to one of four different immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE) (cf. Chap. 7 ). Upon immunization, B cells expressing specifi c antibodies on their cell surface (representing a fi fth immunoglobulin class, IgD) bind intact antigen and are activated. The surface-bound antibodies bind specifi c epitopes of the pathogen, and in close cooperation with T-helper cells (T h -cells), the B cell becomes activated eventually resulting in massive clonal proliferation. The proliferated B cells are called plasma cells and excrete large amounts of soluble antibodies (Fig. 22.4 panel b) . Antibodies are able to prevent infection or disease by several mechanisms: 1. Binding of antibody covers the antigen with Fc (constant fragment), the \"rear end\" of immunoglobulins. Phagocytic cells, like macrophages, express surface receptors for Fc. This allows targeting of the opsonized (antibody-coated) antigen to these cells, followed by enhanced phagocytosis. 2. Immune complexes (i.e., antibodies bound to target antigens) can activate complement, a system of proteins which then becomes cytolytic to bacteria, enveloped viruses, or infected cells. 3. Phagocytic cells may express receptors for complement factors associated with immune complexes. Binding of these activated complement factors enhances phagocytosis. 4. Viruses can be neutralized by antibodies through binding at or near receptor binding sites on the virus surface. This may prevent binding to and entry into the host cell. Antibodies are effective against certain but not all infectious microorganisms. They may have limited value when CMI is the major protective mechanism.

The T h -cells provide type 2 help necessary for the effector function of B cells. This type 2 help is characterized by the lymphokine pattern produced: interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13. These lymphokines trigger B cells, which eventually results in the production of IgM and IgG antibodies. Cells carrying MHC class I molecules process endogenous (intracellularly produced) antigens like viral and tumor antigens and present them in combination with class I molecules on the cell surface (see Fig. 22 .4 , panel c).

For instance, to prevent tetanus a high blood titer of antibody against tetanus toxin is required; in mycobacterial diseases such as tuberculosis, a macrophage-activating CMI is most effective; in case of an infl uenza virus infection, CTLs probably play a signifi cant role besides antibodies. Importantly, the immune effector mechanisms triggered by a vaccine and, hence, the success of immunization depend not only on the nature of the protective components but also on their presentation form, the presence of adjuvants, and the route of administration. The presentation form of the vaccine is one of the determinants that infl uence the extent and type of immune response that will be evoked (Pashine et al. 2005 ; Pulendran and Ahmed 2006 ) . DCs and other APCs play a pivotal role in how the antigenic determinants of a vaccine will be processed and presented to T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Through various PRRs, DCs are more or less able to \"sense\" the type of pathogen that is encountered. This determines the set of co-stimulatory signals and proinfl ammatory cytokines that will be generated by APCs when presenting the antigen to Th-cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. For instance, pathogens or vaccines containing lipoproteins or peptidoglycans will trigger DCs via TLR-2, which predominantly generates a T h2 response, whereas stimulation of DCs through TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-5, or TLR-8 is known to yield robust T h1 responses. Therefore, vaccines should be formulated in such a way that the appropriate T h response will be triggered.

Immunochemical assays, such as enzymelinked immunoassays and radioimmunoassays, are powerful methods for the quantifi cation of the vaccine component. By using monoclonal antibodies (preferably with the same specifi city as those of protective human antibodies) information can be obtained about the conformation and accessibility of the epitope to which the antibodies are directed. Moreover, the use of biosensors makes it possible to measure antigen-antibody interactions momentarily, allowing accurate determination of binding kinetics and affi nity constants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u25a0 Characterization"}, {"text": "Depending on their specifi c characteristics, vaccines are stored as solution or as a freeze-dried formulation, usually at 2-8 \u00b0C. Their shelf life depends on the composition and physicochemical characteristics of the vaccine formulation and on the storage conditions and typically is in the order of several years. The quality of the container can infl uence the long-term stability of vaccines, e.g., through adsorption or pH changes resulting from contact with the vial wall. The use of pH indicators or temperature-or time-sensitive labels (\"vial vaccine monitors,\" which change color when exposed to extreme temperatures or after the expiration date) can avoid unintentional administration of inappropriately stored or expired vaccine.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u25a0 Storage"}, {"text": "Despite the tremendous success of the classical vaccines, there are still many infectious diseases and other diseases (e.g., cancer) against which no effective vaccine exists.

The characteristics of the ideal vaccine are listed in Fig. 22 .1 . 2. Antibodies are able to neutralize antigens by at least four mechanisms: (a) Fc-mediated phagocytosis (b) Complement activation resulting in cytolytic activity (c) Complement-mediated phagocytosis (d) Competitive binding on sites that are crucial for the biological activity of the antigen 3. T cells are able to distinguish exogenous from endogenous antigens by the type of self-antigen (MHC antigen) that is associated with processed antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Processed antigen binds to MHC molecules, resulting in a cell surface located antigen/MHC complex. The complex is recognized by the T-cell receptor/ CD4 or CD8 complex. A cell infected with a virus presents partially degraded viral antigen (i.e., endogenous antigen) complexed with class I MHC. The complex is recognized by CD8-positive T cells, resulting in the induction of cytotoxic T cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells like macrophages phagocytose exogenous antigen and present it in conjunction with class II MHC. CD4-positive T cells bind to the MHC-antigen complex. Subsequent B-cell or macrophage activation leads to antibody or infl ammatory responses, respectively. 4. Classical vaccines consist of either live attenuated vaccines or nonliving vaccines. For nonliving vaccines, we discern three generations. The fi rst generation comprises suspensions of inactivated, pathogenic organisms. Second-generation vaccines contain purifi ed components, varying from whole organisms or extracts of organisms to purifi ed single components. Thirdgeneration vaccines are either well-defi ned mixtures of purifi ed components or protective components formulated in an immunogenic presentation form. Examples of these categories are given in Table 22 .4 . 5. The fi rst problem concerns the low immunogenicity of plain peptide vaccines. The immunogenicity can be improved by constructing multiple antigen peptides or by chemical coupling of peptides to carrier proteins. Alternatively, peptide epitopes can be incorporated into carrier proteins through genetic fusion of the peptide DNA with that of the carrier protein. The second problem of peptide antigens is that their conformation does not necessarily correspond to that of the epitope in the native protein, which in case of B-cell epitopes may lead to poor immune responses or responses to irrelevant peptide conformations. Solutions to this problem are sought in constraining the conformation of the synthetic peptide by chemical cyclization methods. 6. The advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines are listed in Table 22 .6 . An advantage of RNA is that there is no risk of incorporation into host DNA. On the other hand, RNA is less stable than DNA. 7. The three production stages are (a) cultivation of cells and/or virus, (b) purifi cation of the desired components, and (c) formulation of the vaccine. 8. Examples of combination vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis(\u2212polio) vaccines and measles-mumps-rubella(\u2212varicella) vaccines. Prerequisites for combining vaccine components are: (a) Pharmaceutical compatibility of vaccine components and additives (b) Compatibility of immunization schedules (c) No interference between immune responses to individual components", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 68, "end": 75, "text": "Fig. 22", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1833, "text": "Table 22", "ref_id":

( a ) Activation of T-helper cells (Th-cells). An antigen-presenting cell ( APC ), e.g., a dendritic cell, phagocytozes exogenous antigens (bacteria or soluble antigens) and degrades them partially. Antigen fragments are presented by MHC class II molecules to a CD4-positive Th-cell; the MHC-antigen complex on the APC is recognized by the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) and CD4 molecules on the Th-cell. The APC-Th-cell interaction leads to activation of the Th-cell. The activated Th-cell produces cytokines, resulting in the activation of macrophages (Th1 help), B cells (Th2 help; panel b ), or cytotoxic T cells (panel c ). ( b ) Antibody production. The presence of antigen and Th2-type cytokines causes proliferation and differentiation of B cells. Only B cells specifi c for the antigen become activated. The B cells, now called plasma cells, produce and secrete large amounts of antibody. Some B cells differentiate into memory cells. ( c ) Activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ).
