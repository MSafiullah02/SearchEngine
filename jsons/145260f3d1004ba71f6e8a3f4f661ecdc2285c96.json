Structural genomics aims at studying a large number of gene products including whole genomes, topologically similar proteins, protein families and protein subtypes in parallel. Particularly, therapeutically relevant targets have been selected for structural genomics initiatives. In this context, integral membrane proteins, which represent 60-70% of the current drug targets, have been of major interest. Paradoxically, membrane proteins present the last frontier to conquer in structural biology as some 100 high resolution structures among the 30,000 entries in public structural databases are available. The modest success rate on membrane proteins relates to the difficulties in their expression, purification and crystallography. To facilitate technology development large networks providing expertise in molecular biology, protein biochemistry and structural biology have been established. The privately funded MePNet program has studied 100 G protein-coupled receptors, which resulted in high level expression of a large number of receptors at structural biology compatible levels. Currently, selected GPCRs have been purified and subjected to crystallization attempts",

As the requirements for drug safety and 1 efficacy have become more demanding and complex the costs for drug development have soared and the number of drug candidates even reaching the market has become very rare. The translation of in vitro efficacy to a desirable effect in animal models has been of major concern and even finally to obtain a drug which demonstrates the same profile in patients in clinical trials. There have been lengthy discussions related to the problems for pharmaceutical companies to fill their pipelines with novel innovative drug candidates. Cynically, it has been postulated that most major discoveries have already been made in drug development. On a more positive note, the sequencing of the human genome has revealed potential new drug targets. The advent of functional and structural genomics and their combination promises to become important tools in the discovery of novel cellular functions and pathways, which might uncover novel drug functions and open avenues for new medicines.",

Structural genomics therefore presents a great opportunity to improve the success in the discovery process of novel drugs. A drawback of studying a large number of protein targets is the need of large resources. For this reason, networks with expertise in various areas such as protein expression, purification and structure determination have been established. Several such consortia are described in this chapter. The MePNet project, which uniquely targets membrane proteins, is described in more detail. Moreover, a brief background in structure based drug design and examples of successful applications are presented. Today, one of the cornerstones for structural biology on therapeutically relevant proteins is recombinant protein production. The essential and most frequently used methods for expression are highlighted. Likewise, the procedures involved in protein purification and the various approaches for structure determination such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy-based techniques are described. As 60-70% of the current drugs are targeted to membrane proteins a special emphasis is dedicated to this type of proteins.",

In this approach a focused set of fragments from successful drug-like molecules is applied taken into account molecular weight (< 200 Da), the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and solubility. 8 Also virtual screening can be applied, where large libraries of candidate fragments are systematically docked in the predefined binding site of the target protein in 3D computer models. 5 Additionally, it was demonstrated that NMR-based screening can be used to design small molecule drug candidates to inhibit the aberrant overexpression of c-myc in a variety of tumors by inhibition of the far upstream element (FUSE) binding protein (FBP) expression. 9 An interesting example of structure-based drug design comes from the program of synthesis of novel inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular indications. 3 Based on the X-ray structure, a rational drug design approach was initiated to develop a series of heterocyclic replacements for the parent ring system in zaprinast to obtain novel inhibitors of PDE. After intermediate steps, the synthesized compound UK 92480 (sildenafil) showed 100-fold increase in PDE5 inhibitory activity compared to zaprinast as well as unprecedented selectivity over other PDE enzymes. 10 Although the pharmacological profile of sildenafil was as expected the clinical performance in patients with coronary heart disease was disappointing. However, further studies demonstrated that sildenafil blocked the PDE5 action which potentiated the natural activity of nitrose oxide and could be used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (impotence). 11 Although originally developed for a completely different indication, the globally known blockbuster drug Viagra can therefore be considered as an example of how structural biology at least indirectly could facilitate the drug discovery process. Several other examples exist where structural knowledge has directly influenced drug design as briefly summarized below.",

The major advantages of applying structural information are the shorter time required and the possibility to develop medicines with improved potency and selectivity. In addition to application in lead discovery many available protein structures have been used directly for the development of drug candidates. Today, 42 structurebased drug compounds have successfully entered clinical trials and at least 7 drugs have been approved on the market. 12 For instance, the AIDS drugs Agenerase\u00ae and Viracept\u00ae were designed based on the high resolution structure of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteinase. 13 Similarly, the structure of the influenza virus neuraminidase was the basis for the flu drug Relenza\u00ae. 14 The 3D structure of the kinase domain of c-Abl proved also helpful in designing and particularly avoiding resistance to the protein kinase drug Gleevec\u00ae. 15 The number of structure-based drugs will certainly increase with time as more structures will be available. The study on kinase inhibitors already applies structurebased approaches and for example the crystal structure of the AKT kinase has presented an attractive target for development of small molecule inhibitors as tumor therapeutics. 16 However, the major boost in structure-based drug discovery is expected when finally structures of the largest topological group of drug targets, membrane proteins, will be available.",

Among membrane proteins, only the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor isolated from the electronic organ of the Torpedo marmorata ray 17 and the bovine rhodopsin from cow retina 18 could be purified in quantities that allowed successful crystallization and structure determination. As a good example of the minute quantities of protein present in native tissue, the equivalent of 1000 pig brains was needed to purify 190 g of the neuropeptide Y2 receptor for functional studies. 19 Despite efforts of miniaturization, structural studies still require tens to hundreds of milligrams of purified protein. Naturally, in case of human proteins, ethical considerations will prevent any large scale purification efforts from native tissue. It has therefore been essential to establish robust recombinant protein expression systems to provide material for structural biology. In this context, all potential host cells including bacteria, yeast, insect and mammalian cells have been evaluated and expression vectors with a variety of properties engineered.

Perhaps the most applied approach for cell-free translation is the simple amino-selective or uniform stable isotope labeling, which presents the opportunity of direct sample analysis by NMR. 21 The strongest limitation of cell-free translation systems was for a long time the low expression levels obtained for membrane proteins. However, a cell-free translation system based on a modified E. coli S30 extract has provided significant improvement in expression levels also of membrane proteins. 22 For instance, two bacterial membrane proteins, multidrug transporter TehA and YfiK, were expressed at levels of 2.7 mg/mL. Likewise, such GPCRs as the human 2 adrenergic receptor ( 2-AR), the human muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor (M2R) and the rat neurotensin receptor (NTR) were evaluated for cell-free expression. 23 To obtain functional binding of the GPCRs the 2-AR had to be fused to G s, 24 the M2R to G i 25 and the NTR to maltose binding protein (MBP). 26 The M2R had additionally the glycosylation sites and the third intracellular loop deleted.",

Traditionally, E. coli-based expression has been reliable for soluble cytoplasmic proteins especially when applying fusion constructs. 28 Novel high throughput methods for E. coli expression including rapid cloning systems such as Gateway vectors 29 are reviewed elsewhere. 30 Recombinant protein secretion has also become feasible from Gramnegative bacteria, where the heterologously expressed protein is targeted to the periplasmic space or secreted into the culture medium. 31 Expression of membrane proteins in E. coli has, however, been more difficult. Two approaches have been taken where the recombinant protein is either targeted to the bacterial membrane or accumulated in inclusion bodies as aggregates. In the former case, the success has been relatively good for bacterial membrane transport proteins and receptors. 32 In contrast, expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins has been more difficult and the yields have been disappointingly low due to the toxicity to the host bacteria imposed by the foreign protein inserted in the membrane. However, major engineering involving evaluation of different deletions, fusion partners and tags has resulted in significantly improved expression of GPCRs. In this context, the fusion of the maltose binding protein (MBP) to the N-terminally deleted rat neurotensin receptor (NTR) resulted in milligram quantities of receptor protein. 26 Similarly, when the C-terminally truncated human adenosine A2a receptor was expressed as an MBP fusion protein 10-20 nmol receptor/L was produced in E. coli inner membranes. 33 Alternatively, the expression in bacterial inclusion bodies can generate high yields, but as the recombinant protein is present in aggregates refolding is mandatory to restore functional activity. The refolding process has generally been difficult and inefficient for membrane proteins. 34 Recently, technology improvement has provided some promising results for the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1), 35 the human leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1 36 and the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor. 37 ",

Isotope labeling is feasible as most strains are auxotrophs for multiple amino acids. Transformation methods have been developed for L. lactis and for instance the commonly used nisin NisA promoter with the NisR and NisK regulatory trans-acting factors represents a tightly regulated system. 39 The L. lactis system has demonstrated high expression levels of such prokaryotic membrane proteins as ABC transporters and MSF (major facilitator subfamily) efflux pumps. 38 For the yeast mitochondrial carrier proteins CTP1 and AAC3 with a 6 TM topology yields up to 5% of total protein were obtained. However, attempts to express the human KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor resulted only in low levels (< 0 1% of total membrane protein). In another study, 11 yeast mitochondrial transporter proteins were expressed in L. lactis in a functional form. 40 The expression levels were 10-fold higher when a lactococcal signal peptide was used or the N-terminus of the transporters was deleted. The expression levels are now compatible with amounts needed for structural biology. Preliminary data for GPCR expression in L. lactis also looks promising (Kunji, personal communication).",

For instance, Bacillus subtilis was already in the 1980s considered as a potentially efficient host for recombinant protein production such as interferon 41 and truncated viral membrane proteins. 42 The drawback with this approach was that the recombinant proteins were heavily degraded by bacterial proteases. However, the expression of bacterial proteins such as -amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens resulted in secretion of large quantities of active enzyme. 43 Recently, novel plasmid vectors inducible by IPTG have been engineered for high level intra-and extracellular expression in B. subtilis. 44 The characteristic feature of the Archaebacterium Halobacterium salinarum is its purple color, which relates to the accumulation of bacterio-opsin protein (Bop) complex formed with the chromophore retinol. 45 Attempts have been made to employ H. salinarum for heterologous gene expression. Fusion constructs of C-terminally tagged Bop to E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase (AT), human muscarinic M1 receptor, human serotonin 5-HT2 receptor and yeast mating factor receptor Ste2 have been engineered. 46 The significance of the Bop sequence was evident as introduction of tags in this area reduced both mRNA and protein levels substantially. The Bop-AT fusion protein yields were 7 mg/L. In contrast, the fusions to the human GPCR constructs demonstrated no expression evaluated by immunoblotting. However, the Ste2 receptor showed a positive signal in Western blots, but the expression levels were much lower than for Bop-AT. In another study, the human muscarinic M1 and adrenergic 2B receptors were expressed from Bop fusion vectors. 47 Membranes isolated from cells expressing the Bop-M1 fusion showed no specific signal, whereas membranes from Bop-2B cells were specifically recognized by a BR polyclonal antibody. Not unexpectedly, no binding activity was detected for Bop-M1. In contrast, specific binding was observed for Bop-2B, albeit 10 times weaker than obtained in yeast or mammalian cells.",

More than 200 recombinant proteins have been expressed in P. pastoris, including bacterial, fungal, plant, insect, mammalian and viral proteins. For instance, an endoglucanase from Streptomyces viridosporus resulted in yields up to 2.5 g/L. 71 Likewise, human fibrinogen was produced at 100 mg/L. 72 A relatively large number of membrane proteins have been expressed from P. pastoris vectors. The mouse serotonin 5HT5 receptor was the first GPCR to be expressed in P. pastoris. 73 Engineering of an -factor signal sequence from S. cerevisiae resulted in significantly higher yields (22 pmol/mg). Similarly, when the human dopamine D2 receptor was expressed in P. pastoris the receptor density was as low as 1200 receptors/cell, which could be enhanced by 20-fold by the introduction of the -factor signal sequence. 74 Improvement of expression levels by several folds was observed for the mouse 5-HT5A, the dopamine D2S and the 2 adrenergic receptors by introduction of the biotinylation (biotin-tag) of the transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermanii at the C-terminal. 75 It is thought that the biotin-tag stabilized the receptor directly against degradation or through prevention of the unfolding protein response. The pharmacological profile of GPCRs expressed in P. pastoris was similar to native tissue. 74 However, due to differences in lipid composition the ligand affinities were generally lower in yeast than in mammalian cells. The overexpression of GPCRs resulted in localization of receptors to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in contrast to the translocation to the plasma membrane in native mammalian cells. Highlevel overexpression in mammalian cells has, however, also resulted in prominent retention of receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum. 76 Receptor levels could be significantly enhanced by addition of specific agonists or antagonists or other supplements to the growth medium during methanol induction. 77 Among other membrane proteins, the water channel aquaporins were expressed in P. pastoris with C-terminal His-and myc-tags. 78 Recently, the structure of the spinach aquaporin SoPIP2 was solved after purification of the recombinant channel expressed in P. pastoris. 79 A rat neuronal voltage-sensitive K + -channel was overexpressed in P. pastoris, which allowed purification and single particle imaging and reconstitution of 2D crystals by cryo-EM. 80 The high resolution structure of another mammalian voltage-dependent K + channel from the Shaker family was resolved after heterologous expression in P. pastoris. 81 ",

The robust expression obtained from baculovirus vectors have made them attractive for production of various types of human recombinant proteins. 85 Although baculovirus vectors were originally developed for transduction of insect cells, modified vectors with mammalian-specific promoters has allowed efficient expression in different mammalian cells. 86 This approach has, however, mainly served functional studies and drug screening programs as relatively high virus concentrations are required to established efficient transduction rates in mammalian cells, which make large-scale applications unfeasible. In contrast, the scale-up procedure in insect cells is straight forward and presents a sensible alternative to bacterial and yeast expression for production of large quantities of recombinant protein for structural studies. Scaleup has been conducted in several insect cell lines, preferentially in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9 and Sf21 cells), Mamestra brassica and Trichoplusia ni (High Five) cells. 87 Baculovirus vectors have been applied for the expression of several membrane proteins and especially GPCRs. For instance, rhodopsin was expressed at yields of 4-6 mg/L of which 80% represented functional receptor. 88 Optimal expression has been obtained under the following conditions: 87 bioreactor cultures with control of stirring speed, oxygen supply, removal of CO 2 and ambient temperature; dividing cells are infected at a low MOI; cells are harvested before they start to disintegrate. In an attempt to improve folding and transport of membranes proteins to the plasma membrane the signal sequence from the influenza hemagglutinin gene was placed in front of the human 2 adrenergic receptor, which resulted in approximately twofold increase in receptor expression. 89 In another study, 16 human GPCRs were expressed in three baculovirus-infected cell lines and monitored by radioligand binding assays. 90 The expression levels varied considerably from 1 to 250 pmol/mg protein.",

Typically, Drosophila Schneider cells have been applied for heterologous expression of cytosolic, membrane and secreted proteins. 84 The generation of stable Schneider SL-3 cell lines is relatively easy and cheap. To verify the capacity of post-translational modifications and protein transport in insect cells the VIP36 (vesicular integral membrane protein) was expressed in SL-3 cells. 84 In parallel, a truncated form of VIP36 served as the model for a secreted protein and annexin XIIIb was studied to evaluate myristoylation in SL-3 cells. The secreted truncated VIP36 was N-glycosylated and the N-glycan of the Golgi-localized fulllength VIP36 was endo-H resistant. Moreover, annexin XIIIb was myristyolated suggesting that SL-3 cells can be considered as suitable hosts for mammalian proteins. Drosophila cells were used for the large scale production of human interleukin 5 (IL5) and soluble forms of its receptor alpha subunit. 96 The deglycosylated form of IL5 was active and a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure determined from the purified recombinant protein. Also GPCRs have been subjected to expression studies in Drosophila cells. 97 In this context, the human mu opioid receptor (hMOR) was expressed in Schneider 2 cells with an N-terminal EGFP-tag. The recombinant EGFP-hMOR showed a similar pharmacological profile as detected in mammalian cells and functionality was demonstrated by cAMP stimulation and [ 35 S] GTP S binding. Comparison of binding data and quantitative EGFP fluorescence intensity analysis indicated that a relatively large number of the receptors did not present high-affinity binding, which might be at least partly due to retention of the receptors in intracellular structures.",

In a study where four secreted proteins were stably expressed from different promoters in various cell lines, the highest expression levels were obtained from the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) LTR promoter in CHO-K1 cells. 99 Expression levels for membrane proteins have generally been relatively low in stable cell lines. Typically, the kappa opioid receptor was expressed at 266 fmol/mg in CHO cells. 109 More recently, improved levels in the range of 1 to 20 pmol have been obtained for certain GPCRs, although resulting in only moderate yields of 0.1 mg/L in large scale production. Exceptionally high levels of rhodopsin were produced in an inducible mutant HEK293 suspension cell line1. 110 In this case, up to 6 mg receptor was obtained per liter culture. In addition to GPCRs the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein has been expressed in stable cell lines. 111 For instance, the cold-inducible pCytTS system based on the Sindbis virus replicase 112 generated 250,000 SERT receptors per cell, whereas using the tetracycline-inducible T-Rex system produced 400,000 copies per cell. 111 ",

For example, when the nonstructural glycoprotein NS1 from tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was expressed from a CMV major early-immediate promoter in a replicationdeficient adenovirus vector up to 25% of the total protein was represented by NS1. 114 Several GPCRs have been expressed from adenovirus vectors. For instance, the mu (MOR) and kappa opioid receptors (KOR) were expressed in CHO cells from replication-deficient adenovirus vectors as fusion proteins with GFP or as such. 115 The pharmacological properties of the recombinant receptors were identical to observations in native tissue. In comparison to expression in stable cell lines, 3 fold higher expression levels (B max values of 3 pmol/mg) were obtained. Likewise, the 2 adrenergic receptor was expressed in rabbit myocytes at a level of 4 pmol/mg receptor. 116 Vaccinia virus expression systems have been engineered as hybrid vectors with bacteriophage RNA polymerases, especially applying T7 phages 117 and as replication-deficient vaccinia virus vectors. 118 Hundreds of foreign genes have been expressed from vaccinia virus vectors. 119 Several GPCRs have been expressed in mammalian cells as recombinant proteins using vaccinia virus vectors. In this context, it was demonstrated that the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor was localized in the plasma membrane and saturation binding experiments suggested that 5-10 million binding sites existed per cell. 120 Also the human dopamine D2 and D4 receptors were expressed from vaccinia virus vectors in rat-1 cells in a functional form. 121 The GABA transporter was expressed in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus demonstrating similar expression levels to transient expression. 105 Replication-deficient lentivirus vectors generally based on the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) have been widely applied to gene expression in cell lines and in vivo especially in cases were long-term expression is advantageous. 122 The expression from lentivirus vectors is generally driven by an internal cassette as lentiviral promoters are inefficient in human cells and biosafety concerns require control mechanisms. 123 Efficient reporter gene expression (GFP and lacZ) was obtained both in cell lines and in vivo from the constitutive CMV-1E promoter. 122, 124 Lentivirus vectors have also been used for the expression of membrane proteins. The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) retinal GPCR was expressed in COS-7 and ARPE-19 (retinal pigment epithelium) cells from replication-deficient vectors. 125 The expression was verified by immunodetection and 3 H all-trans-retinal binding showing 100 fold higher expression levels in ARPE-19 cells than in COS-7 cells. The long-term expression was demonstrated by stable expression up to 6 months. Tranzyme Pharma has recently developed the lentivirus-based TranzExpression Technology (TexT\u2122), which has been successfully evaluated for a number of GPCRs (www.tranzyme.com).",

Also the development of high density crystallization microplates in 96 or higher format has contributed to the high throughput nature. 137 It has therefore become possible to optimize solution variables such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentrations of salts and detergents. This approach has allowed the establishment of up to 100,000 crystallization trials per day. Important issues are the harvesting and storage of crystals to be analyzed at synchrotron radiation facilities, data collection at beam lines and characterization of obtained crystals.

The aim of the program was to subject 100 GPCRs to structural biology by developing technologies for expression, purification and crystallization in a high throughput format. The target GPCRs were selected based on ligand availability, representation of GPCR families and subtypes and relevance to human disease. Initially, expression evaluation was carried out in three expression systems based on E. coli, P. pastoris and SFV vectors. The expression in bacteria was targeted to inclusion bodies, whereas the GPCRs in yeast and mammalian cells were aimed at membranes. Expression in E. coli resulted in a success rate of 46% measured by immunodetection, whereas in yeast and mammalian cells 94% and 96%, respectively, of the GPCRs were successfully expressed. Overall, more than 60 different GPCRs were expressed at structural biology compatible levels, i.e. at least 1 mg/L at least in one of the three systems. Further expression optimization improved the binding activity for P. pastoris and SFV, leading to the highest binding values of 180 and 287 pmol/mg, 130 respectively. The yields for wellexpressed GPCRs in E. coli were further improved in fermentor cultures resulting in up to 350 mg/L. A limited number of GPCRs have been purified and subjected to refolding attempts. Similarly, selected GPCRs from yeast and mammalian cells have been solubilized and purified. Crystallization attempts on the first purified GPCRs are in progress. MePNet launched in 2005 the second phase of its program (MePNet2), which will have a strong focus on crystallography. The MePNet teams are confident that several high resolution structures on GPCRs will be available in the near future.",
