            "text": "Nucleoside analogues need to be in vivo phosphorylated to their triphosphates to display antiviral activity.1 The first step of this three-step phosphorylation sequence, leading to the corresponding monophosphates, is essential for their activity. Low activity of nucleoside analogues may often result from poor in vivo monophosphorylation. To circumvent this problem, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), that is, derivatives with a phosphonate P\u2013C\u2013O-linkage instead of a phosphoester P\u2013O\u2013C one, were developed.2 Since ANPs are stable analogues of nucleoside monophosphates, in contrast to the \u2018classical\u2019 acyclic nucleoside analogues (such as acyclovir, ganciclovir or penciclovir),1 they do not require activation by the first phosphorylation.3 Moreover, the presence of the phosphonate group makes ANPs resistant towards phosphomonoesterases and nucleotidases, enzymes involved in nucleotide catabolism. Owing to the specific mode of action, ANPs enhance a broad spectrum of antiviral activity.3 Several of them (i.e., cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir, Fig. 1\n) have been approved for the treatment of viral infections.3 However the therapeutic use of the ANP drugs is limited by poor oral bioavailability, potential nephrotoxicity or development of resistant viral strains.3 In attempts to overcome these problems, a variety of structural analogues were synthesized and biologically evaluated.4 Among them, compounds with the aza function at the 1\u2032-, 3\u2032-, or 4\u2032-position of the acyclic moiety (Fig. 1, analogues 1, 2 and 3, respectively)5 as well as N-(phosphonomethyl)prolinol derivatives 4\n6 (Fig. 1) have also been developed. Among the synthesized derivatives, compounds 2 (B = Gua or Cyt) were endowed with a weak anti-herpes virus activity.5a\n",

Compounds 8 can be regarded as aza-congeners of cidofovir. Taking into account the location of the aza function at the 2\u2032-position of the side chain, they can be also considered as complementary to the abovementioned 1\u2032-, 3\u2032-, and 4\u2032-aza analogues of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates.",

Based on our previous experience in synthesizing nucleoside aza-analogues,7 we decided to achieve compounds 8 via simultaneous introduction of the aza and dialkylphosphoryl function to the nucleobase in one reaction step, that is, by N-alkylation of the nucleobase with the phosphonylated N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 under Vorbr\u00fcggen\u2019s conditions.",

Starting from diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 5, the p-toluenesulfonylamino function of 7 was introduced by two methods [Scheme 2, conditions (i)\u2013(iii) or (iv)]. The first one involved the following steps: (i) transformation of 5 into azide 9 using sodium azide at room temperature;9 (ii) reduction of 9 to amine 10 under Staudinger\u2019s conditions;9 and (iii) N-sulfonation of 10 with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; the overall yield of 11 was 59%. The second method [conditions (iv)], that is, direct reaction of 5 with p-toluenesulfonamide in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate, afforded 11 in 68% yield. We also tried to prepare 11 by reaction of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 with N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)aziridine10\n12 in the presence of sodium hydride [conditions (v)]. However, this approach was not satisfactory; 11 was obtained in a low yield of 23%. In the next step [conditions (vi)], N-alkylation of 11 with chloromethyl pivalate in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate gave N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 in a high yield of 96%. Reaction of 7 with the pyrimidine nucleobases (thymine, 5-fluorouracil or uracil) was performed according to the one-pot base silylation/nucleoside coupling procedure using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) as the silylating agent and tin(IV) chloride as the Lewis acid [Scheme 3\n, conditions (i)]. The thymine derivative 13a and the 5-fluorouracil derivative 13b were obtained as the only products in a yield of 83% and 55%, respectively. The only exception was the reaction of 7 with uracil; the desired azanucleoside 13c (the major product, 73%) and 1,3-disubstituted uracil 14 (7%) were obtained. The minor product 14 was readily separated by column chromatography. Coupling of 7 with N\n4-benzoylcytosine under the same conditions, followed by treatment of the crude product (not shown) with ammonium hydroxide gave the cytosine derivative 13d in 80% yield [Scheme 3, conditions (ii)].",

Structure and purity of derivatives 8a\u2013c was verified by standard NMR and IR techniques as well as by elemental analysis. In contrast to 8a\u2013c, solubility of the cytosine derivative 8d in water (5 mg/ca. 100 ml of water) and in conventional organic solvents, including dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, was very low. For this reason, only IR spectrum and elemental analysis was performed for 8d. Therefore, in an attempt to transform 8d into the corresponding sodium salt, a suspension of 8d in a water/DMSO mixture was shaken with DOWEX\u00ae 88 ion-exchange resin (Na-form). Contrary to our expectation that 8d would gradually dissolve upon the treatment with the ion-exchange resin, the suspension (which was then identified by elemental analysis as the unchanged 8d) was still observed. Therefore, the time of shaking was prolonged for six months. Nevertheless, the conversion of 8d to its sodium salt was not satisfactory. Filtration of the unchanged 8d and evaporation of the solvents from the filtrate afforded a small amount of a solid (8d\u2013s, 15 mg from 50 mg of 8d) which was identified by elemental analysis as an equimolar mixture of 8d and its monosodium salt (not shown). The 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture allowed us to confirm the structure of 8d. Unfortunately, solubility of 8d\u2013s in DMSO or in water was too low to measure the 13C NMR spectrum.",

The antiviral activity was expressed as (i) the effective concentration (EC50) required to reduce virus-induced cytopathic effect by 50%, as determined by visual scoring of the CPE [assays (a)\u2013(c)] or by measuring the cell viability with the colorimetric formazan-based MTS assay [assays (f)]; or (ii) the effective concentration (EC50) required to reduce virus plaque formation by 50% [assays (d) and (e)]. None of the evaluated compounds, at the highest (subtoxic) concentrations used (i.e., 10\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL), was active against the viruses examined.",

The biological results demonstrate that replacement of the 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)-propyl moiety in cidofovir with the N-(2-phosphonomethoxyethyl)-N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)aminoethyl function causes annihilation of the antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. This lack of antiviral activity may be due to the poor cell membrane permeability of the free phosphonic acids 8, resulting from the polarity of the phosphono group.2 Considering the fact that masking of the phosphono group with a lipophilic function decreases the polarity of ANPs,2, 11 we have undertaken research on such modification of 8. This study as well as antiviral activity evaluation of masked derivatives of 8, including diesters 13, will be a subject of a forthcoming publication.",

Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (200\u2013400 mesh, Merck). High Resolution Mass Spectra (Electrospray Ionisation, ESI) were performed on a Mariner\u00ae spectrometer in positive ionization mode. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin\u2013Elmer System 2000 spectrometer in KBr disc; resolution was 2 cm\u22121; absorption maxima (\u03bd\nmax) are given in cm\u22121 and quoted as \u2018s\u2019 strong, \u2018m\u2019 moderate, \u2018w\u2019 weak, \u2018br\u2019 broad. The 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Gemini-200BB (200 MHz) or on a Varian Mercury-400BB spectrometer (400 MHz). The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini-200BB spectrometer at 50 MHz. 1H and 13C chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the solvent signals (CDCl3, \u03b4\nH (residual CHCl3) 7.26 ppm, \u03b4\nC 77.16 ppm; or DMSO-d\n6, \u03b4\nH (residual DMSO-d\n5) 2.50 ppm, \u03b4\nC 39.52 ppm), or relative to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS), which was used as an internal standard for the spectra taken in D2O; signals are quoted as \u2018s\u2019 (singlet), \u2018d\u2019 (doublet), \u2018t\u2019 (triplet), \u2018q\u2019 (quartet), \u2018m\u2019 (multiplet), and \u2018br s\u2019 (broad singlet). Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz. The 1H\u20131H ROESY (Rotating frame Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) for 13a was measured on a Varian Mercury-400BB spectrometer in CDCl3. The 1H\u201313C HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation) for 13b was measured on a Varian VNMRS 500 spectrometer in CDCl3. Elemental analyses were performed in a Perkin Elmer 2400 apparatus. Anhydrous MgSO4 was employed as a drying agent. Solvents were distilled off under reduced pressure in a rotating evaporator.",
