Clinical experience from Italy shows that after critical COVID-19, some patients may have memory and executive function deficits, and older patients with the severe type can also have confusion and executive problems (6) due to a direct viral involvement of the CNS (7) or the effect of hypoxemia. A report of COVID-19associated encephalitis (8) suggested that patients with persistent altered mental status should probably undergo a neuroradiological examination. Considering that nearly 50% of ARDS survivors showed cognitive sequelae at 2 years after the injury (9) and that these deficits could play a significant role in overall disability, a bedside screening of executive functions and memory is highly recommended. We recommend screening patients using quick tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Frontal Assessment Battery.",

We recommend starting at different levels. First, hospitals and PMR services should provide a regular communication plan to healthcare workers, to avoid circulating fake information and to increase the sense of community. Second, a telephone helpline should be considered for outpatients and families. Then, patients and staff should be regularly screened for any sign of depression and/or suicide intentions.
