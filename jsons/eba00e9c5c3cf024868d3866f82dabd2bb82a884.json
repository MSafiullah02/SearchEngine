            "text": "The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.",

Peripheral focal or multifocal GGO affecting both lungs in 50% -75% of patients is another observation [9] .",

            "text": "Similarly, Zu et al. [8] and Chung et al. [6] discovered that 33% of chest CTs can have rounded lung opacities. In Fig.1 , chest X-ray images taken at days 1, 4, 5 and 7 for a 50-year-old COVID-19 patient with pneumonia are given, and explanations of these images are also provided [20] . Application of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis in the medical field have recently gained popularity by becoming an adjunct tool for clinicians [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Deep learning, which is a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data, without the need for manual feature extraction [26, 27] . Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in many problems such as arrhythmia detection [28] [29] [30] , skin cancer classification [31, 32] , breast cancer detection [33, 34] , brain disease classification [35] , pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images [36] , fundus image segmentation [37] , and lung segmentation [38, 39] . The COVID-19 epidemic's rapid rise has necessitated the need for expertise in this field. This has increased interest in developing the automated detection systems based on AI techniques. It is a challenging task to provide expert clinicians to every hospital due to the limited number of radiologists. Therefore, simple, accurate, and fast AI models may be helpful to overcome this problem and provide timely assistance to patients. Although radiologists play a key role due to their vast experience in this field, the AI technologies in radiology can be assistive to obtain accurate diagnosis [40] .",

This model is trained with 125 chest X-ray images, which are not in a regular form and were obtained hastily. Diagnostic tests performed after 5-13 days are found to be positive in recovered patients [52] . This crucial finding shows us that recovered patients may continue to spread the virus. Therefore, more accurate methods for the diagnosis is needed. One of the most important disadvantages of chest radiography analyses is an inability to detect the early stages of COVID-19, as they do not have sufficient sensitivity in GGO detection [8] . However, well-trained deep learning models can focus on points that are not noticeable to the human eye, and may serve to reverse this perception.",

Therefore, while designing the deep model used in this study, the Darknet-19 model [59] is chosen as the starting point. Darknet-19 is the classifier model that forms the basis of a real-time object detection system named YOLO (You only look once) [59] . This system has the state-of-the-art architecture designed for object detection. The DarkNet classifier is used on the basis of this successful architecture. We designed the DarkCovidNet architecture (available at https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19), inspired by the DarkNet architecture that has proven itself in deep learning, instead of building a model from scratch. We have used fewer layers and filters as compared to the original DarkNet architectures. We gradually increased the number of filters such as to 8, 16, 32. To better understand this new model, it is helpful to understand the basics of the Darknet-19, which consists of 19 convolutional layers and five pooling layers, using Maxpool. These layers are typical CNN layers with different filter numbers, sizes, and stride values. Let the letter C denote a convolutional layer, and M denote a Maxpool layer. As C 1 is taken as the input layer, Darknet-19 has a layer layout as follows.",

Deep learning models are sensitive in detecting COVID-19 lung involvement and hence the diagnostic accuracy rate is high. During the evaluation of the model, X-ray radiographs of COVID-19 patients confirmed positive by the PCR Test are used. The model can easily detect GGO, consolidation areas, and nodular opacities, which are the pathognomic findings of patients for COVID-19 on X-ray radiography. In COVID-19, bilateral, lower lobe, and peripheral involvement is observed, and the proposed model can detect localization of the lesion. These models are particularly important in identifying early stages of COVID-19 patients. Early diagnosis of the disease is important to provide immediate treatment and to prevent disease transmission. The models can also play an indispensable role in patients lacking early symptoms. There is a margin of error in patients with diffuse late lung parenchyma and in patients with significantly reduced lung ventilation due to poor quality X-ray images. X-rays that are not of optimal quality are difficult to evaluate by radiologists. The clinical and radiological images of later-stage patients are well established and it is easier to detect the findings by experts. The role of deep learning models is more prominent in screening and diagnosis when the infection is at its early stages.",

Also, such models can be used to diagnose other chestrelated diseases including tuberculosis and pneumonia. A limitation of the study is the use of a limited number of COVID-19 X-ray images. We intend to make our model more robust and accurate by using more such images from our local hospitals.",

In Fig. 4, each DN (DarkNet) layer has one convolutional layer followed by BatchNorm, and LeakyReLU operations, while each 3\u00d7Conv layer has the same setup three times in successive form. The batch normalization operation is used to standardize the inputs, and this operation has other benefits, such as reducing training time and increasing stability of the model. LeakyReLU is a variation of the ReLU operation used to prevent dying neurons. Unlike ReLU or sigmoid activation functions, which have zero value in the negative part of their derivatives, LeakyReLU has a small epsilon value to overcome the dying neuron problem. Similar to the Darknet-19 model, the Maxpool method is used in all the pooling operations. Maxpool downsizes an input by taking the maximum of a region determined by its filter. When working with two classes, the proposed model performs the COVID-19 detection task. If three different classes of images are used in the input, the same model performs the classification task to determine the labels of the input chest X-ray images as COVID-19, Pneumonia, or No-Findings.

Secondly, the DarkCovidNet model is trained to detect two classes: COVID-19 and No-Findings categories. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the 5-fold cross-validation procedure for both the binary and triple classification problem. Eighty percent of X-ray images are used for training and 20% for validation. The experiments are repeated five times as shown in Fig. 5. All of the split k pieces are wrapped in folds to use in the validation stage. We have trained DarkCovidNet for 100epochs.

It can be noted from Fig.6 that there is a significant increase in loss values in the beginning of the training, which decrease substantially in the later stage of the training. The main reason for this sharp increase and decrease is attributed to the number of data in the COVID-19 class, which is far less than the other two (Pneumonia and No-Findings) classes. However, when the deep model examines all X-ray images over and over again for each epoch during the training, these rapid ups and downs are slowly reduced in the later part of the training. The multi-class classification performance of the DarkCovidNet model has been evaluated for each fold, and the average classification performance of the model is calculated. The overlapped as well as each separate confusion matrix (CM) are shown in Fig.7. The overlapped CM is created using the sum of CMs obtained in all folds. Thus, it is aimed to obtain an idea about the general perforations of the model. The DarkCovidNet model achieved an average classification accuracy of 87.02% to classify: no findings, COVID-19, and Pneumonia categories.

The DarkCovidNet model is designed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using X-ray images, without requiring any handcrafted feature extraction techniques. The developed model helps to provide a second opinion to expert radiologists in health centers. It may significantly reduce the workload of clinicians and assist them to make an accurate diagnosis in their daily routine work. The proposed model can save time (the diagnostic process is fast); hence specialists can focus on more critical cases. In this work, we have shared the outputs of the model with expert radiologists to confirm model robustness. We shared the top prediction errors of the model and the actual labels of the X-ray dataset with radiologists.",
