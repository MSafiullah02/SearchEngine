In part, this is because professional sports leagues in East Asia developed long after similar leagues in North America and Europe. Humphreys and Watanabe (2012) noted that East Asian professional sports leagues follow a \"hybrid\" model of organization where these leagues adopt the rules, regulations, and structure used by prominent North American or European leagues playing the same sport. For example, the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league, the top professional baseball league in Japan, employs a league structure similar to that used by Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America. Likewise, many of the football (soccer) leagues in East Asia adopted promotion and relegation ladders like professional football leagues in Europe and South America.",

Although some Major League Baseball teams are owned by large corporations-notably the Seattle Mariners, purchased by Japanese consumer electronics giant Nintendo in 1992-some other major North American professional sports leagues, and some European football leagues, explicitly ban corporate ownership of teams. The East Asian \"hybrid\" model of league organization has important implications for league outcomes and team operations. In this chapter we discuss this model, the operation of professional sports leagues in East Asia, and also discuss some uniquely East Asian professional sports like Sumo and attempts by North American and European leagues to gain footholds in the large and growing East Asian professional sports market.",

One reason for corporate ownership of professional sports teams in Japan and South Korea is that, prior to the creation of professional leagues, the strongest sport clubs often played in industrial leagues. Corporations in Japan and South Korea formed these industrial leagues in order to help develop and manage players as if they were semi-professional athletes. In this manner, industrial leagues helped develop much of the structure in regards to professional sport franchises, as well as to foster connections to local communities in sports such as baseball, football, and even basketball.",

Beijing Guoan, a popular football club in China, were owned by a state owned enterprise, and were often considered to be one of the teams which was to develop talent for the Chinese national team. When business regulations were changed in China to allow organizations to operate sport teams as a business, the Chinese football leagues moved from clubs of state-owned enterprises to clubs owned and operated by private (industrial) businesses. Once private companies were allowed to purchase sport teams, many of the largest corporations in China invested in sport teams as their counterparts had done in Japan and South Korea. While there have been different paths to corporate ownership of sport teams in East Asia, this ownership form is now widely employed throughout the region.",

The chapter focuses on football, baseball, and basketball leagues in Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. Note that we follow the convention of referring to the sport North Americans call \"soccer\" as \"football.\" While other professional sports leagues exist in East Asia, these are the oldest and highest profile leagues in this region. We also discuss some factors common to East Asian professional sports leagues, and the attempts by North American leagues to expand their footprint into the region. Figure 1 shows total attendance in the most recent season (2012 or 2013) for eight professional sports leagues in East Asia: Nippon Professional Baseball, J-leagues 1 and 2 (football in Japan), the Chinese Super League (football in China), the Chinese Basketball League, the K-League (football in Korea), the Korean Baseball Championship, and the Chinese Professional Baseball League (baseball in Taiwan). Professional baseball in Japan attracted almost as many fans as the other leagues combined, and professional baseball in Korea is the second most popular team sport in the region. Nippon Professional Baseball is the oldest of these leagues (founded in 1950) . After the NPB, the next three largest leagues, in terms of attendance, are the Korean Baseball Championship and the professional football leagues in Japan and China.",

Rather, as had been the practice during the modernization projects in Japan during the Meiji Period , the country turned to industrial experts to learn how to best operate their organizations and business institutions. As MLB was the predominant professional baseball league in the world at that time, it was only natural for the NPB to try to emulate the success of MLB in North America. In 1950, the NPB began play with 12 teams divided into two different leagues, similar to the American League and National League in MLB. The Pacific League of NPB followed the structure of the American League employing a designated hitter, and the Central League of NPB followed the National League by forcing pitchers to bat.",

This happened as recently as 2004 when the Kintetsu Buffaloes were forced to merge with Orix BlueWave to form the team that is now known as Orix Buffaloes. Naturally, when these two teams merged, a vacancy was created in the league leading to the creation of the expansion Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in order to have six teams in each league and maintain a balanced schedule. NPB teams currently play a 140 game regular season. Salaries in the NPB are relatively high. In 2010, the average salary was about $ 421,000 (Jane et al. 2013) .

While this postseason format was used for decades, eventually the league realized that expanding its playoff structure would provide more excitement, as well as generate additional revenue for clubs and the league. This expansion of the postseason came about because regular season attendance in the league had been on the decline for several years, with the 2007 season having especially poor attendance. Again, the NPB emulated the playoff expansions in MLB, by adding what is called the \"Climax Series\" in each league. The Climax Series first made its appearance in 2007, with the second and third place teams meeting in the first stage of the Climax Series. The winner of the first stage (best-of-five series) advances to the second stage where they meet the first place team in each respective league. The Climax Series system is somewhat complicated by the fact that the second series, between the league champion and the winner of the first-stage playoff, is a best of six format, where the team that finished in first place in the league starts with a \"free\" win and a 1-0 advantage. In other words, the first team to get four wins advances to the Japan Series, with the team that won the regular season title given the advantage of a free win. The NPB postseason has been criticized for years, first for not allowing enough teams into the postseason, and second for changing the system in a way that does not give the underdog an equal chance to advance and win the Japan Series. Despite this criticism, the Climax Series playoff system has been successful to some degree in creating interest around in the league, and allowing more teams to compete for the postseason championship.",

            "text": "Because of the natural ties to their parent corporations, professional baseball teams in Japan are often subsidized heavily in order to make payroll and keep operations running smoothly. It is believed that only a few of the teams in NPB actually turn a profit. The Tokyo Yomiuri Giants, often compared to the New York Yankees, are the dominant team in Japanese baseball in terms of history, tradition, past performance, and star power. Because of this, the Giants have a large following through the country, and are able to profit from this popularity. In addition to Yomiuri, the Hanshin Tigers are the only other profitable team in the league. In You Gotta Have Wa, Whiting (2009) noted that the Seibu Lions may be the team which are run most like a business. That is, despite the profitability of the Tokyo Giants and Hanshin Tigers, it could be inferred that these franchises are able to earn profits because of their popularity, and not because they are operated like a successful professional sports team. In his profile of the Seibu Lions owner, Whiting (2009) notes the owner's disinterest in the sport of baseball, and demand that the Seibu Lions be run like a business, in the same way that the Seibu Railway Company is operated. Curiously, while the Lion's owner is against having the Lions being fully subsidized by Seibu Railway Company to the same extent as other teams in the NPB, the owner has heavily subsidized a professional, industry-sponsored ice hockey league, as he is fan of that sport. The business of professional baseball in Japan is dependent on the economic success of the parent companies. In this sense, it is possible that economic downturns and recessions have a very negative effect on Japanese professional baseball.",

            "text": "Like North American leagues, the NPB employs a reverse-order draft to allocate top amateur talent to the teams. In this familiar system, the team with the worst record is given the first pick in the amateur entry draft. The idea behind this is that the worst team will naturally select the best available talent and hopefully improve the quality and talent level of the franchise. In Japanese baseball, the Tokyo Giants have long been seen as the dominant team, and some critics claim that the team has too much control over NPB rules, regulations, and policy. This claim is supported by recent changes in the NPB draft system. The league recently determined that the reverse-order draft system was not fair, and decided to install a new system for allocating incoming talent to teams. Under this new system, called \"gyakyushimei,\" or reverse designation, NPB teams jointly decide which player is the best amateur player in Japan before the draft. This player is then allowed to choose which team he would like to play for. After the top player picks his team, the rest of the teams get to pick from the remaining eligible players in the standard reverse-order format. One problem with this change in draft regulations is that it often allows the best players to go to the championship or high paying teams like the Tokyo Giants. This system has again changed in recent years, with teams being picked via a lottery system to select players in the draft. For example, in the 2013 NPB draft, the overall consensus was that the first player to be picked would be high school pitcher Yuki Matsui. Five teams put themselves into a lottery to be able to draft Matsui. In the end, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, who were also competing in the Japan Series, gained the rights to Matsui. Under this lottery system, successful teams still able to obtain the rights to the best incoming player in the league, as the Golden Eagles were able to do in this case (Nagatsuka 2013) .",

The NPB experienced a controversy in 2013 because of the characteristics of the balls used during games, suggesting that the league has problems standardizing playing conditions. 2012 was one of the worst years in the NPB history in terms of the total number of home runs hit, and the league was concerned that the lack of offensive output might adversely affect attendance and revenues. The lack of offensive production, combined with increasing numbers of the best players moving to North America to play in MLB, led the NPB to try to reinvigorate the game. To do this, the league decided to use game balls that were uniform across all clubs in the league; these balls were livelier than ones used in the past. In previous seasons, the NPB did not have a standard league-wide sanctioned ball. Rather, individual franchises were able to pick and choose which balls they would use for games as long as they met certain standards set by the league. The initial complaints over using different balls first occurred when Japan was competing in the World Baseball Classic (WBC). Players returning from the WBC noted that the balls used in the WBC were consistent, and that many of the teams in Japan were using baseballs that behaved differently depending where games were played.",

In the early part of the season, offensive production increased significantly in the league, with more home runs being hit. When players, coaches, and the media became suspicious about the increase in offense in the NPB, the league admitted that they had changed the balls without informing anyone. The public backlash against the league was strong, including calls for the head of the league to resign. Commissioner Ryozo Kato resigned in September, several months after it was determined that the game balls had been surreptitiously changed by the league (Calcaterra 2013). As evidence of the effect that the new \"juiced\" balls had on offensive production, Wladimir Balentien set a new NPB record for homeruns in a season, hitting 57 out of the park. While some noted that Balentien had benefitted from the juiced ball as he had only hit 62 combined homeruns in the previous two seasons, the NPB denied that the new balls had any effect on setting a new home run record.",

Interleague games began in 2005 as a move by the NPB to try and combat declining attendance, and recapture the interest of fans, which started to follow star Japanese players like Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui who moved from the NPB to the USA to play in MLB. The initial interleague games were between pairs of teams in home-and-away three-game series between every team in each league. The NPB found that this format created too many interleague games and diminished the traditional rivalries that exist between league members, and reduced all of the series to two games. To further add excitement to the interleague games, the NPB decided that, instead of spacing interleague games out through the season, as is done in MLB, all interleague games would be played in a span of about two months. Under this system, all teams would play their interleague games simultaneously, and the team with the best record would be awarded the \"interleague\" title. From 2005 through 2013, Pacific League teams have won the interleague title every year, indicating that there may be a lack of balance between the leagues.",

The J-League (like Major League Soccer in the USA) was created because FIFA said they would only allow countries to host a World Cup if they had an established professional football league in operation. The J-League was initially composed of clubs of teams from an industrial league known as the Japan Football League. The J-League began its inaugural 1994 season with ten clubs; most of these clubs were located in the Tokyo/Kanto region in eastern Japan. When the J-League began play, it lacked a lower division because of the push to get the league established for the World Cup bid.

Though much of the structure of the J-League was modeled on European football leagues, the league actually divided the season into two parts, like the Apertura and Clausura (\"opening\" and \"closing\" in Spanish) employed throughout professional football leagues in Latin America. The champions of the first half of the J-League season would face the champions of the second half of the season to decide the league champion. If the same team won both the first and second half, that the team would be named the league champion with no playoff. The J-League eliminated this system in 2004, adopting a single season format in 2005 to better emulate the European league structure. Additionally, by moving to this format, J-League teams had schedules that better matched the rest of the professional football leagues in Asia. This coincided with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) schedule, and also providing easier scheduling for J-League teams competing in international competitions like the Asian Champions League.",

J1 would eventually expand into its current 18-team format, with 22 teams in J2. Additionally, as part of the growth plan for the league created by the Japan Football Association (JFA), the J-League started a plan to establish and expand lower level football leagues to create more players and clubs at the grassroots level. The Japanese promotion and relegation system is now setup so that the teams can move from low-level prefectural leagues, up to Japanese Regional Leagues, up to the Japan Football League, then to J2 and finally to J1.

Three of these tournaments are held in the main Sumo hall, known as Ryogoku, in Tokyo; the other three tournaments are held in the cities of Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka. A Sumo Grand tournament runs for 15 days, with all of the higher-ranking wrestlers scheduled to fight once a day on each day of the tournament, and lower ranking wrestlers fighting about seven bouts during the competition. Professional sumo tournaments use a ranking structure, where individuals who win eight or more matches become eligible to move up in rank, while those who lose eight or more matches risk demotion. Through this system, wrestlers are able to advance from lower divisions such as the \"Makushita\" (literally, below the curtain), all the way up to the top Makuuchi division. In Makuuchi, wrestlers who win the matches advance through a series of titles from komusubi to seikwake up to ozeki. Above the ozeki title is the rank of Yokozuna (Grand Champion), which is reserved for only an elite few wrestlers who are able to constantly display championship-level Sumo wrestling in every Grand tournament. After becoming an ozeki, a wrestler must usually win at least two tournaments in a row to become a Yokozuna. This feat is made especially difficult because an aspiring Yokozuna will face many other ozeki and potentially one or more Yokozuna to win a Grand tournament. Once a wrestler has attained the rank of Yokozuna, they are expected to continue to win bouts, and if their performance falters, they are expected to retire from Sumo rather than continue wrestling.",

In addition, wrestlers earn income from bonuses provided by corporate match sponsors. Notably, sponsors will pay more for matches involving highly ranked and more popular wrestlers; so much of this bonuses money goes to higher-ranking wrestlers. In some cases, a match may have no sponsors; in this case there will be no payout to the winner. Finally, Sumo wrestlers earn other bonus money based on their annual performance, especially the number of tournaments in which they have winning records.

As the investigation continued, rumors that several wrestlers were involved in match-fixing sent the Japan Sumo Association into crisis mode.

The March 2011 Grand Sumo tournament was cancelled, only the second tournament was cancelled since the end of World War II. Eventually, a group of 14 wrestlers admitted they had fixed matches, and were forced to retire from the sport. Despite this positive development, the Japan Sumo Association continued investigations into match fixing and ultimately concluded that they were possibly more wide spread than previously thought.

In order to prevent large groups of people from congregating together, China once had stringent rules about the number of people who could congregate together in a group. Under this rule, enough people could congregate to play a game of basketball without running afoul of the law, but a full 11-a-side football match constituted an illegal gathering. Since only ten people are needed to play a game of basketball, and the laws of the country allowed the sport to be played without fear of repercussion, basketball flourished in China.",

While the CBA still develops a lot of players through club youth teams (for example, NBA players Yi Jianlian and Yao Ming were both developed on CBA club rosters), the country has begun to experiment with different methods to develop basketball talent. The NBL operates as a semi-professional league, providing China with a lower level system that can be used to develop young players.

What factors caused the domestic league to improve yet had no impact on the success of the National team? One possible answer is that China still has not put an effective grassroots youth development system in place that generates homegrown talent. The improved performance of the CSL in continental competitions has come alongside increases in the number of foreign players allowed on CSL rosters. In this, the drive for success in the CSL has potentially come at the cost of developing domestic young talent, as aging international players take roster spots on CSL teams that would have gone to young domestic players. As the CSL has had more success and invested more money into payrolls, they have brought in famous star players from abroad such as Didier Drogba. While the Drogba deal ended with the player leaving China after only playing a short time, it is one example of how far many CSL clubs have gone to attract fans and win league matches.

The NPB team in Fukuoka, the Softbank Hawks, was purchased by the Softbank Corporation after their previous owner; the Daiei Corporation underwent financial distress. As noted earlier in this chapter, professional teams in Japan have not always focused on proper business operations. By treating teams as part of a corporation's marketing or public relations department, it is only natural to expect sport organizations to experience financial loses. Thus, when the parent corporations experience financial problems, the sports franchise is usually one of the first things sold, or in some cases, abandoned. In the Fall of 2013, it was discovered that the professional football club in Fukuoka (Avispa Fukuoka) had been struggling financially and had lost about half a million US dollars in the previous year. Avispa Fukuoka is a club with no corporate ownership and is a publicly traded stand-alone corporation. Because Avispa lack the power of a parent corporation to fully sustain them, the losses have hit the club hard, and there is question about whether the club will be able to remain in J-League. To date, there has not been any other J-League club which has gone bankrupt and been removed from the J-League, and Avispa Fukuoka are the closest team in the league has come to such a dire financial situation.",

            "text": "The presence of teams owned and operated by industrial groups or large corporations is an interesting feature of East Asian professional sports leagues. Other leagues around the world have not adopted this ownership form, although corporations owned some early teams in the National Football League; for example, the Green Bay Packers were started by a large meat-packing firm. This ownership form either disappeared early or was not present in most of the professional sports leagues in the US and Europe. It remains to be seen if this ownership model can support significant growth in leagues to make East Asian football and baseball leagues competitive with the US and European leagues they modeled their competitions on.",

            "text": "However, the emergence of billionaire team owners in China may signal increased problems there, and in other East Asian leagues if Chinese billionaires turn their attention to buying teams in other nearby countries. The presence of deeppocket owners willing to spend large amounts on start players and sustain large operating losses has led to problems in many European football leagues, in terms of on-pitch outcomes and increased player costs across all leagues as demand for star players drives up salaries all salaries. If a sufficiently large number of East Asian teams are bought by \"sportsmen owners\" like Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea Football Club in England and United Arab Emirates billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owner of Manchester City Football Club in England, these leagues could experience financial problems like those currently taking place in Europe. The prevalence of corporate-owned teams could exacerbate this problem, if the corporate owners sell teams or refuse to compete with billionaire owners of other teams.",

            "text": "East Asian leagues have also experienced a large number of match fixing scandals over the past 30 years. In part, these scandals can be attributed to the relatively low salaries paid to players and referees in these leagues. Forrest and Simmons (2003) showed that low salaries were key factors in explaining match fixing incidents, as players and officials with lower salaries have a lower cost of fixing matches, and a higher expected net payoff. As salaries in these leagues rise, match fixing should decline as players are less likely to risk loss of these high salaries if they are caught fixing matches.",
