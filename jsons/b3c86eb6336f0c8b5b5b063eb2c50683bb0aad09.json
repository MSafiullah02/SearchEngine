Among 9 multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized 10 for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, 11 particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. 12 Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality 13 evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible 14 interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may 15 influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy.

            "text": "In December 2019, several pneumonia cases were suddenly observed in the metropolitan 35 city of Wuhan (China), as the result of infection to a novel coronavirus (Li et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 36 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . This virus was termed SARS-CoV-2 for its similarity with that responsible of 37 the global epidemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred between 2002 and 2003 38 (Xu et al., 2020) . Patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced serious 39 complications, including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary oedema, severe pneumonia and (Sohrabi et al., 2020; WHO, 2020a) . 46 The drastic containment measures adopted by Chinese government did not prevent the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, which in a few weeks has spread globally. Italy was the first country in 48 Europe to be affected by the epidemic Covid-19, with an outbreak even larger than that originally 49 observed in China (Fanelli and Piazza, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020). Other European 50 countries and United States rapidly registered an exponential growth of clinical cases, leading to 51 restrictions and a global lockdown with evident social and economic repercussions (Cohen and 52 Kupferschmidt, 2020; ECDC, 2020). The WHO has recently declared the pandemic state of Covid-53 19 with over 2.8 million of cases reported and over 201.000 victims worldwide (Cucinotta and 54 Vanelli, 2020; WHO, 2020b; ECDC, 2020, accessed on 27 April 2020). 55 The ongoing epidemic trend in Italy immediately showed strong regional differences in the 56 spread of infections, with most cases concentrated in the north of the country (Remuzzi and   57 Remuzzi, 2020). The distribution of positive cases reported from February 24 th to April 27 th is 58 summarized in Figure 1A : some areas of Lombardy and Piedmont clearly exceeded 10.000 cases, 59 e.g. 18.371 at Milan, 12.564 at Brescia, 11.113 at Bergamo, 12199 at Turin (data re-elaborated 60 from the official daily reports of the Department of Civil Protection, ICPD, 2020, accessed on 27 61 April 2020). Also, the relative percentage distribution of the positive test rate ( Figure 1B ) exhibit 62 higher values in Northern Italy despite a certain uncertainty of data due to the different numbers 63 and frequency of oropharyngeal swabs performed in various regions to test coronavirus positivity; mortality rate ranged from 18% in the northern regions to less than 5% in the others ( Figure 1C ). 65 Overall these trends closely parallel the rates of reported Covid-19 cases and of fatal events, 66 expressed as percentage values normalized to the number of inhabitants for regional populations 67 ( Figures 1D and 1E ), further evidencing a significantly greater diffusion in Northern Italy, both in 68 terms of number of infections and the severity of cases (mortality). 69 To explain such geographical trend, it was initially assumed that restrictions decided by The percentage of European population exposed to levels higher than the regulatory limits 90 is about 7-8% for NO 2 , 6-8% for PM 2.5 , 13-19% for PM 10 and 12-29% for O 3 (EEA, 2019). Premature 91 deaths due to acute respiratory diseases from such pollutants are estimated to be over to two per day) has been exceeded for at least 35 days ( Figure 3C ). Once again, these data would provide 109 evidence that the whole Northern area below the Alpine arc has been constantly exposed to 110 significantly higher levels of these contaminants. 111 The hypothesis that atmospheric pollution may influence the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy ",

Some authors, however, from the clinical 72 course of a large cohort of patients, have concluded that the epidemic coronavirus had been 73 circulating in Italy for several weeks before the first recognized outbreak and the relative adopted 74 containment measures (Cerada et al., 2020). In this respect, the differentiated occurrence of 75 infection cannot be fully explained by the social confinement actions. 76 Since the presence of comorbidities appeared determinant for the aetiology and severity of 77 the Covid-19 symptoms (Chen et al., 2020; Wang T. et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), the role of 78 atmospheric pollution in contributing to the high levels of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy 79 has been hypothesized (Conticini et al., 2020). Association between short-term exposure to air 80 pollution and Covid-19 infection has been described also for the recent outbreak in China (Zhu et 81 al., 2020). The adverse effects of air pollutants on human health are widely recognized in scientific 82 literature, depending on various susceptibility factors such as age, nutritional status and 83 predisposing conditions (Kampa and Castanas, 2008). Chronic exposure to the atmospheric 84 pollution contributes to increased hospitalizations and mortality, primarily affecting cardiovascular 85 and respiratory systems, causing various diseases and pathologies including cancer (Brunekreef 86 and Holgate, 2002; Kampa and Castanas, 2008). Among air pollutants, the current focus is mainly 87 given on nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) and ozone (O 3 ), frequently 88 occurring at elevated concentrations in large areas of the planet.89",

Since the effects of air pollutants on human health not 96 only depend on their concentrations but also, if not especially, on chronicity of exposure, 10 as presented in Figure 2. The highest atmospheric concentrations were clearly 99 distributed in the Northern areas (Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna), in addition 100 to urbanized cities, such as Rome and Naples. 101 The long-term condition of population exposure is also revealed by the number of days per 102 year in which the regulatory limits of O 3 and PM 10 are exceeded (Figure 3A-B): the critical situation 103 of Northern Italy is reflected by values of up to 80 days of exceedance per year (average of the last 104 three years, EAA, 2019). Worthy to remind, ozone is one of the main precursors for the formation 105 of NO 2 , and chronic exposure to this contaminant for almost a quarter of a year is undoubtedly of 106 primary importance. The chronic air pollution in Northern Italy is further represented by the 107 number of years during the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limit value for PM 10 (50 \u00b5g/m 3 108",

The latter were 114 expressed as average concentrations in the last 4 years of NO 2 , PM 2.5 and PM 10 (Figure 4A-C) and 115 the number of days exceeding the regulatory limits (averages of the last 3 years) for O 3 and PM 10 116 (Figure 4D-E). The always significant correlations provided further evidence on the role that 117 chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may have as a favourable context for the spread 118 and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 within a population subjected to a higher incidence of respiratory 119 and cardiac affections.120 It is well known that exposure to atmospheric contaminants modulate the host's 121 inflammatory response leading to an overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 122 (Gouda et al., 2018). Clear effects of Milan winter PM 2.5 were observed on elevated production of 123 interleukin IL-6 and IL-8 in human bronchial cells (Longhin et al., 2018), and also NO 2 was shown to 124 correlate with IL-6 levels on inflammatory status (Perret eta al., 2017). The impairment of respiratory system and chronic disease by air pollution can thus facilitate viral infection of some viruses with the atmospheric levels and mobility of air pollutants 129 (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007; Sedlmaier et al., 2009). The avian influenza virus (H5N1) could be 130 transported across long distances by fine dust during Asian storms (Chen et al., 2010), and 131 atmospheric levels of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , carbon monoxide, NO 2 and sulphur dioxide were shown to 132 influence the diffusion of the human respiratory syncytial virus in children (Ye et al., 2016), and the 133 daily spread of the measles virus in China (Chen et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). 134 Although the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be 135 established, chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination and related diseases may represent a 136 risk factor in determining the severity of Covid-19 syndrome and the high incidence of fatal events 137 (Chen et al., 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Dutheil et al., 2020; Wang D. et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). 138 In conclusion, the actual pandemic event is demonstrating that infectious diseases represent 139 one of the key challenges for human society. The periodic emergence of viral agents shows an 140 increasing correlation with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors (Morens et al., 141 2004; Jones et al., 2008). Our findings, if confirmed by future studies, suggest that air quality 142 should also be considered as part of an integrated approach toward sustainable development, 143 human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads. However, the role of atmospheric 144 pollution should be considered in a long-term, chronic perspective, and adoption of mitigation 145 actions only during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility. We need to highlight that our 146 analyses did not include other important determinants of Covid-19 incidence and mortality, such 147 as age structure, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet or smoking habits), the prevalence of pre-existing 148 conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory problems and diabetes prior to the pandemic, 149 the capacity of the healthcare system, the case identification practices (e.g. the percentage of the 150 population that were tested and the percentage of positive tests to the total number of tests), and 151 the duration of the confinement, among others. Given these limitations, our findings should be 152 interpreted as more hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory. As such, we call for future 153 studies to fill this gap of knowledge by addressing at which extent the aforementioned factors may 154 have mutually contributed to the diffusion of Covid-19 in Italy. 155 Note: A complete description of the origin of the used data and the methods of graphic and Regional distribution of Covid-19 outbreak in Italy (from February 24 to April 27, 2020.
