This suggests that homogeneous mixing at the beginning of an epidemic may not be a good assumption. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 spread much more slowly than would have been expected on the basis of the data on disease spread at the start of the epidemic. Early in the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 it was estimated that R 0 had a value between 2.2 and 3.6. At the beginning of an epidemic, the exponential rate of growth of the number of infectives is approximately (R 0 \u2212 1)/\u03b1, where 1/\u03b1 is the generation time of the epidemic, estimated to be approximately 10 days for SARS . This would have predicted at least 30, 000 cases of SARS in China during the first four months of the epidemic. In fact, there were fewer than 800 cases reported in this time. An explanation for this discrepancy is that the estimates were based on transmission data in hospitals and crowded apartment complexes. It was observed that there was intense activity in some locations and very little in others. This suggests that the actual reproduction number (averaged over the whole population) was much lower, perhaps in the range 1.2-1.6, and that heterogeneous mixing was a very important aspect of the epidemic.",

Once an epidemic has started we may switch to a deterministic compartmental model, arguing that in a major epidemic contacts would tend to be more homogeneously distributed. However, if we continue to follow the network model we would obtain a somewhat different estimate of the final size of the epidemic. Simulations suggest that the assumption of homogeneous mixing in a compartmental model may lead to a higher estimate of the final size of the epidemic than the prediction of the network model.",

For transmission of disease after this initial contact we need to use the excess degree of a vertex. If we follow an edge to a vertex, the excess degree of this vertex is one less than the degree. We use the excess degree because infection can not be transmitted back along the edge whence it came. The probability of reaching a vertex of degree k, or excess degree (k \u2212 1), by following a random edge is proportional to k, and thus the probability that a vertex at the end of a random edge has excess degree (k \u2212 1) is a constant multiple of kp k with the constant chosen to make the sum over k of the probabilities equal to 1.

We begin by assuming that patient zero is a vertex of degree k of the network. Suppose patient zero transmits infection to a vertex of degree j. We let z n denote the probability that this infection dies out within the next n generations. For the infection to die out in n generations each of these j secondary infections must die out in (n \u2212 1) generations. The probability of this is z n\u22121 for each secondary infection, and the probability that all secondary infections will die out in (n \u2212 1) generations is z j n\u22121 .

The data that goes into such a network includes household sizes, age distributions, travel to schools, workplaces, and other public locations. The networks constructed are very complex but may offer a great deal of realism. However, it is very difficult to estimate how sensitive the predictions obtained from a model using such a complex network will be to small changes in the network. Nevertheless, simulations based on complicated networks are the primary models currently being used for developing strategies to cope with a potential influenza pandemic. This approach has been followed in [8] [9] [10] .",
