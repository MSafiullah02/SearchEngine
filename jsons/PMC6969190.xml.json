It involves sources of sustained rapid electrical activity that can trigger arrhythmic episodes as well as pathological mechanisms which alter the electrical and structural substrate for AF in the atrial tissue3\u20137. A full understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which various underlying conditions and factors converge to progressively promote AF substrate is still lacking8\u201310. Drugs aimed to target the atrial remodeling (upstream therapies) are attractive new options to prevent AF perpetuation. However, early pre-clinical testing of such drugs is currently difficult due to the absence of reliable and affordable animal models.",

However, over the last two decades, rodents have been increasingly used to study various mechanistic aspects in the pathophysiology of AF12\u201318, and the possibility of using rodents to test new therapies seems attractive. However, several technical limitations constrain the widespread utility of rodents in AF research. Particularly, the small and delicate rodent atria render the implantation of chronic pacing and recording electrodes challenging. As a result, AF substrate is evaluated using either ex-vivo preparations or invasive studies in deeply anesthetized rodents that are sacrificed at the end of the procedure. Indeed, repeated testing of AF substrate development over time utilizing measurements under physiological conditions, (i.e. in the unanesthetized state) has not been reported thus far to the best of our knowledge. Recently, Hulsmans et al.19 reported the development of a miniaturized pacemaker for long-term pacing studies in rodents. However, although this technically-advanced system may open remarkable new opportunities, the currently introduced pacer could not be used for the electrophysiological (EP) testing, which was done conventionally under deep anesthesia as a single terminal procedure.",

Specifically, MBHE is a powerful tool to assess the supraventricular EP of rodents consistently and precisely20,21. Moreover, by using a bi-atrial pacing and recording device, our laboratory previously performed atrial EP measurements in unanesthetized rats and was able to characterize in details the effect of short-term atrial tachypacing (up to 24 h) on atrial electrical remodeling20.

Failure of the initial procedure occurred in less than 10% of cases and included either periprocedural mortality or failure in the implantation of the atrial MBHE leading to absence of effective atrial pacing. During preliminary experiments we encountered failures to reach the final EP testing at 4 weeks in several occasions as a result of self-extraction of the back connector. This problem was totally resolved by the placement of a shielding ring over the back connector (Fig. 1). Initial experiments included 43 rats divided into 3 groups: Base group (n = 12) implant with the atrial pacing & recording device EP tested at 1 W only. These animals were thereafter used for atrial tachypacing experiments, which were recently reported25 and are beyond the scope of the current study. Sham group (n = 15) co-implanted with atrial pacing & recording devices and osmotic mini-pumps delivering solvent only (PEG-400). Aldosterone (Aldo) group (n = 16) co-implanted with atrial pacing & recording devices and osmotic mini-pumps delivering Aldosterone dissolved in PEG-400. An additional MI group (n = 14) included rats subjected to device implantation and left coronary artery ligation. An additional sham-operated group maintained two in a cage separated by a mesh barrier, was also included (n = 7) in order to test the contribution of social isolation as a source of intrinsic AF substrate. Finally, a new MBHE composed of medical-grade silicone and Platinum-Iridium (Pt-Ir) poles was also evaluated (n = 13). Apart from the base group, all of the reported EP results are only for rats that could be tested serially at 2 W and 4 W. For the new MBHE, reported results include serial tests up to 8 W from the initial surgery.",

Briefly, the implantable device is composed of an 8-pin \u2018female\u2019 connector that is attached by highly flexible insulated electrical wires (AS155-36, Cooner wires, Chatsworth, CA) to a single miniature-bipolar hook electrode (MBHE). The MBHE contains a distal head with two sharp tungsten pins (100 \u03bcM in diameter, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) that are curved and isolated by an insulated coating (transparent melting glue) up to their tips (Fig. 1A). By means of small lateral thoracotomy the MBHE can be fixed on the selected epicardial surface without the need for additional suturing20,22\u201324. Three additional single lead electrodes are utilized for grounding and peripheral ECG measurements (Fig. 1A). Before implantation, the 8-pin \u2018female\u2019 connector and the distal part of the MBHE were covered with latex to prevent direct contact with the skin and subcutaneous tissue during the procedure. Electron beam radiation was applied for sterilization of the device before its use. For device implantation animals were anesthetized (IM ketamine/xylazine 75/5 mg kg\u22121) and mechanically ventilated. Under sterile conditions and constant heating, the MBHE was implanted on the RA, the peripheral electrodes were positioned in the animal\u2019s back and the 8-pin \u2018female\u2019 connector was exteriorized through the skin. A shielding ring with four plastic restraints was used to prevent extraction of the device over time (Fig. 1A,B). After implantation, the ring was inserted over the connector, sutured to the skin and glued to the connector over four plastic restraints. This procedure largely prevented cases of connector extraction during the long periods in which the rats were fully ambulatory (Fig. 1C). Post-operative recovery and analgesia were performed as described previously24.",

In order to fabricate this MBHE, the distal end of two flexible electrical wires coming from the implantable device (AS155-36, Cooner wires, Chatsworth, CA) were inserted in their distal end with Pt-Ir rods (2 mm in length, 200 \u03bcM in diameter). The Pt-Ir rods were then placed parallel to each other on the bottom of a cubic shaped Teflon template (5 mm length \u00d7 2.5 mm width \u00d7 2 mm height), which was subsequently filled with medical-grade silicon (MED-6219P, Nusil, CA). Following incubation of the silicon for 24 hours at room temperature, the electrode was extracted from the Teflon template and two stainless steel insect pins (26002-10, Fine Science Tools, Vancouver, Canada) were angled and embedded into the silicon to form a double hook. An additional shorter pin was inserted in the rear part of the electrode to prevent extraction of the MBHE from the cardiac tissue over time. Following preparation electrodes were excessively washed with 70% ethanol and were sterilized with electron beam radiation before use.",

In order to be able to evaluate changes in AF duration that attenuate the contribution of these long sporadic episodes, the \u201ctotal AF duration score\u201d (range 0\u20135) was defined as follows: 0 \u2013 negative (less than 1 S); 1- episode duration between 1\u20135 sec; 2- episode duration between 5\u201320 sec; 3- episode duration between 20\u201360 sec; 4- episode duration between 60\u2013240 sec; 5- episode duration of more than 240 sec.

LV fractional shortening (FS - %) was calculated according to (LVDed\u2212LVDes)/LVDed \u00d7 100. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using planimetry as follows: EF = 100 \u00d7 (LVD3ed \u2212 LVD3es/LVD3ed). Evaluation of EF within the MI group was performed using Simpson volume analysis (VEVO LAB, VisualSonics, Canada). For this purpose three 2D short axis images were obtained: proximal - just below the mitral valve, mid- at the papillary muscle level and apical- at the apex level. Simpson EF was calculated as: (SIMPS. Area distal + SIMPS. Area mid + SIMPS. Area prox). *Length/3.

However, the variability of the AF substrate parameters in the Aldo group was remarkable, with some animals demonstrating high AF substrate and others demonstrating very low AF substrate parameters under similar conditions (Fig. 2A,B). Of note, a pilot analysis at the end of four weeks confirmed the presence of increased serum aldosterone levels in Aldo treated animals relative to Shams (see Supplementary Figure S1). To further substantiate our findings regarding AF substrate formation with the MBHE system we subjected an additional group of rats to MI, another clinically relevant trigger known to promote the AF substrate of rats30.

Surprisingly, our analysis revealed no association between the level of LA fibrosis and the AF substrate parameters in the Aldo group (Fig. 4A). In contrast, clear association between LA fibrosis and the total AF duration score was found in the MI group (Fig. 4B). Additional analysis of the MI group indicated that the systolic dysfunction of these rats (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 1S) clearly correlated with both MI size and AF substrate parameters (Fig. 5). Overall, our findings indicate that although structural remodeling is an overt finding in both Aldo and MI rats, it seems to indicate increased AF substrate only in the MI group in relation with MI size and impairment of LV systolic function (see discussion).",

Since chronic social isolation is a known trigger of anxiety\\depression in rats33, we raised the possibility that this factor might be involved in the observed AF substrate formation. To test this option in a direct manner we used a simple manipulation allowing socially rewarding interaction between rats through a mesh-barrier34. First, we directly confirmed that behavioral parameters of anxiety\\depression are markedly inhibited in rats interacting through a mesh-barrier (Supplemental text and Supplementary Figure S2). Based on these findings, an additional group of sham-operated rats were maintained for 4 W in cages containing a mesh-barrier. Interestingly, EP analysis revealed that this manipulation could not reduce the AF substrate (Fig. 6). On the contrary, at 4 W animals in the non-isolated group had small but significant increase in AF induction compared to the original (Isolated) sham group.",

To address this possibility, a new type of MBHE was fabricated. In this type of MBHE, tungsten was replaced by Pt-Ir electrode poles and miniature stainless steel pins were used for hooking of the MBHE on the atria (Fig. 7A,B). In addition, as detailed in the methods section, medical grade silicon was used in this electrode instead of the transparent melting glue, which was used in the original MBHE.

However, this study is the first in which the system was successfully employed for repeated EP evaluations over a period of several weeks (up to 8 W with the new MBHE, Fig. 7). A rather simple technical improvement that enabled this achievement was the use of a shielding ring that was sutured to the skin around the back connector (Fig. 1A,B). This addition efficiently prevented device extraction over time by the rats. Apart from this modification, our previously developed MBHE system was well-suited for the long-term EP studies of the present work. Repeated AF substrate evaluations were efficiently obtained from the RA electrode while leaving the LA tissue free of surgical operation for later histological analysis. Atrial-unipolar recordings which we utilized to view the atrial activity of the rats were far superior to the peripheral recordings in terms of atrial signal detection and analysis (Fig. 1E) as we also reported recently (See Fig. 1C in Mulla et al.25). However, a clear limitation of the current setup was the inability to obtain additional EP parameters such as atrial refractoriness (AERP). This is related to the fact that only two electrical poles are present in the current MBHE design and such setup does not allow clear detection of the atrial signal during pacing20. Clearly, a future improvement of the system enabling the insertion of two pairs of electrical poles (one pair for pacing and additional one for recording) would be of great value. Such an improvement might also enable measurements of conduction velocity, another critical parameter which could not be addressed in our unanesthetized rats using the current setup.",

In contrast, the large variance in the developed AF substrate of the Aldo group as well as the absence of correlation between the AF substrate and the level of LA fibrosis are surprising. High Aldo states have been associated with increased prevalence of AF and experimental results also indicate increased density of its receptors in the fibrillating atria37\u201340. Aldo promotes atrial fibrosis and blockade of its receptors can efficiently block this effect37,41\u201344.

In contrast Lammers et al.29, did identify action potential duration shortening following 4 W of exposure to Aldo, which was associated with increased expression of Kir2.1 and Kv1.5 potassium channels in isolated atria of the Aldo-treated rats.

Post-operative AF due to the thoracotomy we performed in the implantation surgery is another option that should be considered. However, post-operative AF typically demonstrate peak incidence between days 2 and 4 after surgery and frequent recurrences, especially during the first postoperative week47. This time course in in clear contrast with the very low AF burden that we consistently encountered 1 W post-op, which gradually developed and increased over time.

Anxiety\\depression related to chronic social isolation is a well know phenomenon in rodents including rats33,49. Thus, we invested substantial effort in delineating the possible role of social isolation as a cause for the intrinsic AF substrate. Using a simple manipulation allowing socially rewarding interaction between rats through a mesh barrier34, we confirmed a substantial reduction in anxiety\\depression. However, we found that this inhibition of anxiety\\depression slightly augmented rather than reduced the developed AF substrate. The possible mechanism\\s of this augmentation can only be speculated and require further and more detailed characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, our data can unequivocally rule out the possibility that chronic social isolation may have a causative roll in the intrinsic AF substrate development of rats implanted with our MBHE system.",

            "text": "Finally, in order to examine the possibility of local interaction between the implanted electrode and the RA, we designed, fabricated and comprehensively tested a new type of MBHE with components that are not expected to promote toxic effects or increased local inflammation. While, the new electrode was highly effective in EP terms, it did not prevent the progressive development of AF substrate over time. It is possible that the local injury induced by the delicate stainless steel pins of the new MBHE is enough to cause some non-uniform conduction leading to AF substrate formation. However, the gradual development of the substrate over a period of many weeks is somewhat inconsistent with this option. Another possibility is that the local load of the implanted electrode on the contracting RA caused stretch related remodeling over time50. Sterile pericarditis due to local removal of the RA pericardium is another option that should be considered. In any case, on a practical level it appears that the intrinsic AF substrate that we characterized here is unavoidable under the current conditions and should be taken into consideration in any future study utilizing this or similar system for mechanistic or pharmacological studies of the AF substrate in rats.",
