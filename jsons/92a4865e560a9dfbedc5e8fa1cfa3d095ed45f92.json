However, the main viral proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design against SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing necessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools. Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand binding. PIC results indicated that, Mpro/ Jensenone complexes forms hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and strong ionic interactions. Therefore, Jensenone may represent potential treatment potential to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential medicinal use.",

            "text": "Computational and structural biology methods have accelerated the discovery of novel drugs used to treat viral diseases. Corona viruses (CoVs) are a group of viruses that infect animals and humans. CoV infections affect animals in various ways like: respiratory, fever, cold, digestive, and liver systems of humans and animals. It is the main protease (Mpro) found in the CoV associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can be accessed in PDB and was suggested to be a potential drug target for 2019-nCov [Lu, 2020) . In many viruses, proteases play essential roles in viral replication; therefore, proteases are often used as protein targets during the development of antiviral therapeutics. In CoV, the Mpro protein is involved in virus proteolytic maturation and has been examined as a potential target protein by inhibiting the cleavage of the viral polyprotein to prevent the spread of infection. The invention of the Mpro/3CLpro protease structure in COVID-19 provides a nice path to identify potential drug candidates to prevent infection. As cited by Liu and Wang (2020), proteases represent key targets for the inhibition virus replication, and the protein sequences of the SARS-CoV Mpro and the 2019-nCoV Mpro are 96% identical, hence host proteases can be used as potential therapeutic targets. We followed the structural biology aspects which focus on the availability and retrieval of a main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like protease (3CLpro) receptor structure from PDB database. The ligand (Jensenone) was docked to main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like protease (3CLpro) using 1-click and swiss dock softwares. Table 1and 2 shows the structure of ligand and amino acids found in the active site pockets of Mpro. in Jensenone compounds are predicted to play roles amino acid residue interactions at the active site of COVID-19 Mpro.",

These residues may be considered as key or critical and may play a major role in the protein protein-interaction and might inhibit the formation of the betabarrel motif of Mpro/3CLpro. Further studies may help to understand the role of these residues in drug binding mechanism. Structural flexibility is one of the important physical properties that affect protein conformation and function. Whereas high increase in kinetics energy and protein flexibility can disrupt non covalent interactions as in thermal denaturation; a sharp decrease in flexibility can also cause protein denaturation as seen in cold denaturation. Therefore, proteins need an essential amount of flexibility to carry out their native function at physiological conditions. In this context, an inhibitor by binding to a protein can alter its flexibility and decrease its enzymatic activity. Finally, lack of wet-lab validation is a drawback in our research and we expect computational biology analysis and its integration with wet-lab data can be productive in the determination of potential anti-Mpro/3CLpro components.

The Mpro has 3 structural domains; domain I (residues 8 -101) and domain II (residues 102 -184) both have beta barrel motifs representing chymotrypsin catalytic domain and domain III (residues 185 -200) with a helical structure participates in dimerization of protein and active enzyme production. Given its vital role in polyprotein processing and virus maturation, Mpro is considered to be a suitable target for viral inhibitor development as an approach toward SARS. Environmental factors can greatly influence the secretion of secondary metabolites from aromatic plants. Therefore, great attention has been paid to the secondary metabolites secreted by plants that may be developed as medicines [Xang et al., 2018]. Among several compounds, essential oils, from medicinal plants, have been reported to have antiviral bioactivities",
