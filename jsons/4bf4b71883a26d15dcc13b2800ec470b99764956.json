When infection is spreading in a population, effective reproductive number (R) is more commonly used to describe transmissibility, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by per infectious case. In the absence of control measures, R = R0\u03c7, where \u03c7 is the proportion of the susceptible population. 6 R>1 means an increase of the number of cases will occur, while R<1 means the number of cases will decline. In order to calculate the R of 2019-nCoV, we need obtain the generation time (GT), also known as generation interval or series interval, which is defined as the time interval between symptom onset in an index case and symptom onset in a secondary case. 6, 7 Due to limited information on GT from our data, we cannot calculate the GT of 2019-nCoV. So, we applied the GT of SARS in a previous study as the GT of 2019-nCoV (GT=8.4 days, SD=3.8 days). 8 In the current study, we applied Exponential Growth (EG) and Maximum likelihood estimation (ML) to estimate effective R value for 164 2019-nCoV cases with available symptom onset. As R value varied in different phase of an epidemic, in order to compare with the R of SARS-CoV, we further estimated the R value of SARS-CoV using the data in the early phase (December 26, 2002 to January 23, 2003) of the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province.",

This finding indicates that rigorous measures of prevention and control taken by Chinese governments are taking into effect. Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, Chinese governments have implemented a series of rigorous strategies and measures to contain the outbreak (Figure S2). For example, as of January 23, a total of 9,507 close contacts were tracked and isolated. This successful management of contacts could effectively contain the further spread of 2019-nCoV across China. More importantly, almost all provinces and regions in China have initiated the highest level of public health emergency response, and epidemic data was released on time through various channels, which could improve the general public to understand the risk of the outbreak, and take voluntary actions to detect, diagnose and treat cases infected 2019-nCoV earlier. This can be verified by decreasing period from onset to isolation from 6.7 days in cases before January 9, to 0.7 days in cases after January 19.",
