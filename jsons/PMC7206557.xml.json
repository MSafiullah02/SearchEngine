In other words, shared social meanings were listed by free associating to words and phrases, but which were relevant to the research question. This led to describing how the Ebola virus/disease was understood in the texts, making way for identifying discourses or the ways in which the disease/virus was constructed. Both researchers critically reflected on the meanings arising from associations to ascertain if they contained unduly idiosyncratic or overpersonalised projections, and they validated each others\u2019 inputs throughout analysis. Simply, they discussed associations and reached consensus by focusing on the relevance of meanings to the research question. Because the meanings arose from the social worlds and culturally consensual realities of the researchers as South Africans who wished to interrogate the representations of diseases, but who were also often sympathetic to African disasters and human loss, they acknowledge that, in line with discursive practice, their shared subjectivities are instrumental in making interpretations following a poststructuralist approach as opposed to aiming for an objectivist and realist encounter with the texts.",

The apocalyptic references in our findings were also invoked in nurses\u2019 utterances about Ebola (Broom & Broom, 2017). Such discourse, however, is not limited to Ebola: In an analysis of how British newspapers portrayed a particular agricultural threat, Larson et al. (2005) found apocalyptic and providential references, with these metaphors complementing warlike responses to disease. However, the threat to humanity discourse can have an enabling outcome to motivate addressing the pandemic. Weldon (2001b) maintained that globalisation rhetoric was deployed to get the virus recognised, leading to renewed medical research. To get help to those most affected because of their less sophisticated health care systems, representation work must resort to personalisation of the threat, even though the discourse remains problematic.",

Pandemics imply \u2018movement, directionality and contagious spread\u2019; boundaries become porous, leading to zones cordoned off for containment (Aaltola, 2012, p. 668). This discourse was also found in Vellek\u2019s (2016) content analysis of newspaper reports of Ebola as a global threat, one made possible by easier travel options in the modern world. However, this discourse, when used in the earlier outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, had the effect of protecting individual governments because it sidestepped the real factors that led to fatalities, that is, the economic and systemic constraints reflected in staff not being trained or enough supplies not being provided (Garrettas cited in Weldon, 2001a). Kamradt-Scott (2016), therefore, in explaining the WHO\u2019s reform of global health security \u2013 although late for West Africa \u2013 comments that the affected countries\u2019 governments should have been more proactive by asking for help because of the global risks. Thus, the effect of the threat to humanity discourse is to detract from national governments\u2019 responsibilities and failures, allocating passivity and even invisibility to their actions and roles while uncontrolled agency is granted to the virus. The uncontrolled agency is also figured into the discourse of invasion which reveals the process that unfolds with graphic descriptions of territorial uncontainment. In other words, the threat to humanity discourse, which rests on the universal globalised fear, is the outer layer of the sinister (unseen) process of invasion.",

Predatory images provoke fear about dangers of the natural world that need taming and control (Olivier, 2007). The social impact implied in the image of a killer, for example, and particularly when linked to a particular geographical location, is for othering to be increased (Larson et al., 2005). Weldon\u2019s (2001b) analytic work about the representations of Ebola as an invisible predatorial virus in nonfiction accounts, such as in Preston\u2019s The Hot Zone, shows that this imagery transforms the Ebola hemorrhagic fever into a legend.

Stigmatised groups redefine how they are represented (e.g., as unsanitary) through the use of conspiracy theories (Joffe, 2011). Washer (2011) asserts that the aim of conspiracy theories is to direct blame back at the West, thereby challenging dominant medical discourses. Our findings showed two types of conspiracy theories, based on whether agency was directed either to phobic high-income countries or within the affected countries. Conspiracy notions led to an uncoordinated and slow response because, close to civil war zones, people in the outbreak area distrusted the government. Infected people did not access treatment facilities (representing the untrustworthy government), and they died at home: This added to understaffed facilities not managing contagious dead bodies, resorting to sending the bodies back to their homes (Brown, Arkell, & Rokadiya, 2015). The conspiracy theme, represented in movies, mobilises global action (Weldon, 2001a). Thus, journalists\u2019 quoting of people\u2019s conspiracy ideas accentuates global attention. Conspiracy theories also allow people to cope with collective trauma \u2013 particularly when attributing causes to outgroups and in doing so, they also problematise the dominant discourses (Franks et al., 2013) which, in South African press reports, related either to medical understandings or predatory images.",

In addition, there may have been newspapers that were absent from the database. That the outbreak occurred 3 years ago does not imply the current study is delayed or irrelevant. The 2013\u20132016 Ebola outbreak was the largest, with approximately 28,639 cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016). In comparison, approximately 2,427 cases were reported in all outbreaks before 2013 (CDC, 2016). Fatalities from the 2013 outbreak, as well as the media representations, point to lessons. The fear discourse spread worldwide, unlike the current 2018\u20132019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has approximately 1,082 cases since August 2018 (WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019) and no similar global hysteria. The DRC outbreak has been difficult to manage partly because of violence stemming from the community\u2019s mistrust of Western medicine and medical staff (WHO, Regional Office for Africa, 2019). Our study highlights discourses similarly contained in the social construction of disease, enhancing understandings about how epidemics are represented in the public sphere, and the findings suggest that media use alternative discourses that could bring social cohesion, social action, and organised medical management, rather than disease management being disabled by fear and conspiracy.",

            "text": "This study illustrated the emotive impact that particular cultural representations of Ebola have in newspaper reports. The consensus among the press reports was that South Africa was not at risk, but the discourses have implications. First, reflected in this study through the threat to humanity discourse, Africa\u2019s deviation from Western norms was implied to be the cause of Ebola, and this upholds colonial hegemony. Second, the discourse of a human criminal who stalks victims seems more distinctive of South African news reportage compared to discourses in other studies\u2019 findings that relied instead on images of a predatory microorganism. Crime headlines in South Africa are not uncommon, and the Ebola reportage deployed similar crime rhetoric. The more common image in other studies about diseases (e.g., AIDS, the plague, tuberculosis) was the waging of a war against an intruder. Ebola, in our research findings, was represented not as a mere intruder but as a human predator. This shift could be considered within the context of individualisation of health risks rather than nationalistic protection because globalisation has removed borders; and readers, rather than nations that can wage war, are allocated responsibility for their health risks. The news reader is incited to be on the lookout for the lurking predator. In the 21st century and in a country at peace, crime against an individual elicits personalised fear, in contrast to the older image of a war that threatens national security. The fear that media incites only occurs because of flaws in health-risk communication, as well as in \u2018our fundamentally flawed human psychology . . . The real tragedy of this failure is in the consequences of that fear reaction, both intended and unintended\u2019 (James, 2014, p. 465). Even if fear discourse could help speed up medical research, the predatory discourse, according to Weldon (2001b), is dangerous globally because it reveals an unsophisticated understanding about humans\u2019 biological relationship with the world through their environmental and scientific intrusions. Poor disease control and medical malpractice spread the disease rather than an anthropomorphised entity (Weldon, 2001a), or virulence (Brown et al., 2015; Weldon, 2001b).",
