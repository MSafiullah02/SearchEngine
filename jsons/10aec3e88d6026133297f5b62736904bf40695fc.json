The presence of SARS-CoV on surfaces is always a concern, although few studies in which live virus has been successfully isolated from an environmental surface have been reported. Surfaces were usually contaminated with patient's droplets or by indirect transfer of virus from gloves that were contaminated with excreted virus. The increase in the isolation rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at the intensive care unit of a Hong Kong hospital during the SARS outbreak suggested that increased cross-contamination could occur if gloves and gowns were worn all of the time [9] . It is important to gather evidence of the survival of SARS-CoV on surfaces so that appropriate infection-control measures can be taken. The present study demonstrates that SARS-CoV can survive in respiratory samples for 5 days at room temperature and for up to 3 weeks at 4\u040aC. Although normal fecal material seems to have a deleterious effect on its survival, the present study shows that the virus could have a prolonged survival when present in diarrheal stool. The virus can survive for 4 days at room temperature after being spiked in diarrheal stool with an alkaline pH. This observation lends evidence that fecal droplets containing SARS-CoV remain infectious for a period of time.
