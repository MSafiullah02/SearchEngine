In its simplest form, gene therapy is the process by which either defective or missing genes are replaced or new functions to the host's cells are introduced. For this purpose, the genetic material is coupled to additional regulatory sequences (e.g., promoters and enhancers) and is packaged inside a gene delivery vehicle to enable transfer and expression of the intended gene product inside the cell (FIG. 1) .",

            "text": "Although conceptually straightforward, the efficient expression of foreign genes is the most critical aspect for the success of in vivo gene therapy. The first step of gene therapy involves gene delivery to facilitate the expression of the therapeutic gene in the interior of a cell. The simplest method is the direct introduction of therapeutic DNA into target cells by physical (i.e., electroporation) or chemical techniques (i.e., lipofection). 1 This approach still remains limited in its application, because it is relatively inefficient, it can be used only with certain tissues and requires large amounts of DNA. Furthermore, among the several barriers to successful gene delivery, foreign genes and/or the vectors used to deliver them can trigger a range of immune responses. However, sometimes, these immune responses have been harnessed behind the concept of using gene therapy as a vaccine (i.e., DNA vaccines). 2 The next difficulty for the foreign genetic material is that once within the cell, it must escape intracellular degradation to enter the nucleus to be expressed (FIG.  1) . 3, 4 Therefore, gene delivery systems (vectors) were designed to protect the genetic material. An ideal vector needs to meet three criteria: 1) it should protect the transgene against degradation by nucleases in the extracellular matrix, 2) it should bring the transgene across the plasma membrane and into the nucleus of target cells, and 3) it should have no detrimental effects. Currently, such vectors of gene transfer can be classified into two categories: 1) viral and 2) nonviral. 5, 6 ",

The HSV-1 thymidine kinase (HSVtk) is an enzyme that metabolizes nontoxic nucleoside analogs, such as ganciclovir (GCV), acyclovir, or valacyclovir (VCV), into a cytotoxic molecule. The GCV metabolite is incorporated into DNA, causing DNA elongation to terminate and subsequently cause cell death. 7 Because the effects of GCV is limited to DNA, it primarily targets the mitotic cells, much like the S phase-specific chemotherapeutic agents, but it also affects the ability of DNA to be repaired by DNA polymerases, and thus it theoretically could also affect quiescent cells with damaged DNA. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in multiple animal studies. 8 -10 Furthermore, preclinical experiments demonstrated marked tumor elimination, despite gene transfer into only a small fraction of tumor cells. 11 This cytotoxic effect of transduced cells on adjacent nontransduced cells is termed the bystander effect. 12 The bystander effect is mediated mainly by the transfer of toxic phosphorylated forms of GCV to nontransduced cells, presumably via gap junctions. 13 Another presumed mechanism contributing to the bystander effect is the targeting of mitotically active endothelial cells in tumor vessels. 14 An immune-associated response against a nonhuman protein, such as HSVtk, leading to diffuse cell death that affects neighboring nontransduced cells has also been suggested. 15 In addition to the bystander effect, tumor cells transduced to express HSVtk and treated with the antiviral agent acyclovir display enhanced sensitivity to radiation in culture and in vivo. 16 Possible explanations for radiation enhancement could be that DNA that has incorporated acyclovir may be susceptible to radiation-induced strand breakage, and/or acyclovir might sensitize cells by inhibiting polymerase activity required for the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. 17 The HSVtk gene therapy approach was tested in human glioma trials (phase III) using RV vectors, and more recently adenovirus (AV) vectors. In fact, a phase III trial in Europe and Israel was recently completed under sponsorship by a British biotechnology venture (Ark Therapeutics) in which an AV-HSVtk vector and GCV were provided to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas (GBMs) before application of standard therapy (radiation and/or temozolomide). Interim results from this trial are available on the company's website at www.arktherapeutics.com/main/products. php?content\u03edproducts_cerepro. To take advantage of the possible synergy between radiation-induced damage of DNA and the inability of DNA with incorporated VCV metabolites to repair itself, we have recently completed a phase I clinical trial for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas, in which AV-HSVtk and VCV is used in conjunction with radiation (Chiocca et al., unpublished) .",

However, for IL-2 and IFN-\u2425 severe CNS toxicity has been reported when these cytokines were secreted by tumor cells intracranially. 42 One clinical trial in humans with recurrent gliomas has been conducted where an AV vector was employed to deliver the gene for human IF-\u2424. 43 Gene therapy can also be used to generate tumor vaccines by inducing tumor antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells. Antigen-presenting cells (i.e., dendritic cells) can be harvested from peripheral blood or brain tumor biopsy specimens, which are transduced with the DNA, mRNA, and/or proteins coding for the tumor antigen(s), and then expanded in vitro before administration to the patient.

Vascular endothelial growth factor is an important overexpressed angiogenic factor in gliomas. It has been shown that in vivo transfer of a recombinant AV vector carrying the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor in an antisense orientation into gliomas inhibits tumor growth. 44 Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that can bind to a complementary RNA sequence. If binding takes place, this DNA/RNA hybrid can be degraded, subsequently preventing protein synthesis. Another study showed significant glioma inhibition by using a RV vector to deliver a signaling-defective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, which forms inactive dimers with wild-type vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. 45 In addition to being one of the gene replacement strategies described earlier, p53 might also have an anti-angiogenic effect due to the discovery that inducing wild-type p53 expression in astrocytomas causes release of an angiogenesis inhibitory factor. 46 The intense neovascularization in malignant gliomas may enable a new intravascular modality of gene therapy for this disease. Although genetic vectors administered intravascularly are unlikely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, intravascular delivery of vectors may target endothelial cells in the brain. So far, no trials have been conducted using this approach in gliomas.",

In the first instance, the vector is derived from a virus from which all or most of the viral genes have been removed to minimize virus-mediated toxicity. In the second instance, selected viral genes are deleted or mutated so that viral targeting and/or replication can occur selectively in tumor versus endogenous neural cells. So far, the replication-defective vectors used in gene therapy trials of brain tumors have been based on retrovirus and AV. In terms of replication-competent (oncolytic) viruses, the ones used in clinical trials of brain tumors have been HSV, AV, reovirus and Newcastle disease virus (Table 1) .

Retroviruses (RVs) are a class of enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded RNA mole- 47, 48 RVs have been primarily used as vectors, although there are preclinical studies and a likely future attempt for a clinical trial using a retroviral-based OV. 49 Recently, a replicationcompetent retroviral (RCR) vector based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus was found to replicate with kinetics similar to those of wild-type Moloney murine leukemia virus, and was also found to be stable through multiple serial passages in cultured cells. Injection of the RCR vector into established subcutaneous and intracranial tumors in mice resulted in highly efficient transmission of the transgene, and in some cases this resulted in transduction of the entire tumor. 50 The following vector systems have been tested in preclinical studies RCR-HSVtk/ganciclovir and RCR-CD/5-FC. One such RCR-CD vector is being developed for possible use in a clinical trial (Tocagen Inc.). The advantages of RV vectors are that they are relatively easy to manipulate for gene therapy purposes and have been used widely. 51 The available long-term experience with low toxicity to normal brain tissue makes this vector a safe candidate for CNS gene therapy. 52, 53 One of the problems of RV vectors is that the viral genome can be inserted randomly in the genome of the host. If the insertion happens to be in the middle of one of the host genes, this gene will be disrupted (insertional mutagenesis). If the disrupted host gene is involved in regulating cell division, uncontrolled cell division (i.e., cancer) can occur. 54, 55 Other disadvantages of RV vectors are low titers, instability of the viral particles, and small transgene capacity (the maximum amount of DNA that can be packaged into a retrovirus allows for only 7.5 kb of foreign DNA). Another drawback of RV vectors is the requirement that the target cell should be dividing for integration and expression of viral genes. This restricts gene therapy to proliferating cells only. 56, 57 Although RV vectors were used in the early gene therapy trials, their use has been greatly reduced in more recent gene therapy trials of cancer. Adenoviral vectors. Adenoviruses (AV) are nonenveloped viruses containing a linear double-stranded DNA genome responsible for respiratory and eye infections in humans. For gene therapy purposes, the commonly used AV vectors are derived from a subgroup that can be manipulated to produce replication-deficient vectors. AVs are the most commonly used gene therapy vectors; in fact, they have become a common tool in the kit of the molecular biology lab whenever a gene needs to be expressed in a mammalian cell. The vector can be extensively modified to target it away from its usual receptor (present only in some cells 58 ) to other receptors present to a desired target cell. 59 Once bound to its receptor, the virus enters the cell in endosomal vesicles that fuse to lysosomes. 60 Then the virus is able to liberate itself and escape to the cell nucleus for gene expression. Viral DNA does not generally integrate into the host genome and survives as an extrachromosomal element.",

AVs do not usually integrate genetic material into the host genome, rather they replicate as episomal elements in the nucleus of the host cell with a transient gene expression, and consequently there is no risk of insertional mutagenesis. 64 The limitations of AV vectors are their short-term gene expression and their production of toxic acute-phase responses. As clinical trials have begun to progress, it has become apparent that AV vectors may cause a significant innate immune response. 65 Oncolytic adenovirus.",

            "text": "Oncolytic AVs are engineered or naturally occurring strains of virus that replicate better in tumor cells versus normal cells. This selectivity can occur at three general levels. First, every time a virus infects a cell, an antiviral response occurs inside the cell consisting of numerous \"stress\" signals (FIG. 2) . The overall effect of these signals is to limit the ability of the infecting virus to replicate and thus limit the number of viral progeny that could go on to infect neighboring cells. These \"stress\" signals consist of genes involved in the IF pathways, NF-kB, toll-like receptor responses, PKR, and others. 66 In some cases, tumor cells have disabled some of these responses, because these responses tend to be pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative. Therefore, tumor cells that have such disabled responses provide better targets for viral replication than normal cells with intact antiviral responses. Second, in tumor cells, several genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis signaling are disrupted. These disruptions in tumor cell factors can be exploited to rationally engineer viral mutants that can not replicate well in normal cells with intact cell-cycle/apoptosis controls, but that will replicate in tumor cells that harbor these disruptions. Finally, viral mutants can be re-engineered so that they will target cell surface receptors present on tumor versus normal cells. For instance, an engineered oncolytic adenovirus (named ONYX-015) lacks a viral gene (E1B) that encodes for a protein that inactivates the cellular tumor suppressor protein p53. This mutant AV was believed to replicate in and lyse p53-deficient human tumor cells, but not cells with functional p53. 67,68 Based on gene mutations, this vector could be of use in as much as 50% of human GBMs carrying a p53 mutation. 69 It may posses anticancer effects against the remaining tumors, because p53 function is modulated by p14 ARF protein with a gene (CDKN2A) that is frequently deleted in GBM. 70, 71 However, subsequent experiments with this virus have revealed that the mechanism of tumor selectivity is not based on the lack of p53 tumor suppressor function, rather on a more complicated mechanism related to the nuclear export of viral mRNAs in tumor cells. 72 Other oncolytic AVs include those that target defects in the p16 INK4a tumor suppressor pathway. 73 The p16 INK4a protein shares the CDKN2A gene region with p14 ARF to make it one the most commonly mutated sides in gliomas.",

            "text": "HSV-1. HSV-1 is an enveloped neurotropic DNA virus. The wild type HSV-1 is able to proceed into a lytic life cycle after infection or persist as an intranuclear episome in a latent state. Interest in the use of HSV-1 as a cancer attacking agent became high in the 1990s after reports showed that a genetically engineered form was oncolytic in brain tumor models. 74 Since then, numerous reports have detailed various types of genetically engineered mutants for glioma therapy. The two most commonly used types have revolved around deletions of the viral genes (UL39 or UL40) that encode for the viral protein, ICP6. This protein possesses the function of a ribonucleotide reductase, and recent reports have linked this defect to an ability to replicate more selectively in cells with a defect in the p16 tumor suppressor gene. 75 The other type has focused on a mutation of the viral gene that encodes for the viral protein ICP34.5. This viral gene counteracts a host cell response (based on the PKR enzyme) that promotes cellular apoptosis during infection. 76 Mechanisms of tumor selectivity of this mutant virus have elicited several reports. In one case, authors have linked this viral defect to enhanced replication in tumor cells with elevated levels of Ras activity. 77 However, others have disputed this claim and have linked mutant OV replication to activity of the MEK pathway present in the tumor more than normal cells. 78, 79 In addition, it is also possible that tumor cells may have lost some PKR function, thus enabling this mutant virus to replicate. 80 Another genetically engineered HSV-1 (termed G207) was designed such that it is a replication competent in GBM, it has attenuated neurovirulence, it is temperature sensitive, and it can be eliminated with ganciclovir. 81 It possesses deletion of the viral genes that encode both ICP6 and ICP34.5, and thus it may selectively target both cells with defects in p16 and with overexpression of MEK. Intraneoplastic inoculation with G207 decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival in animal models with no significant toxicity to the normal brain. Based on these results, two phase I studies using G207 in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM was completed with promising results. [82] [83] [84] HSV-1 as an OV offers several advantages: 1) potential for incorporating a large load of foreign DNA; 2) infects human cells with high efficiency and low viral particle-to-cell ratio; 3) sensitivity to antiherpetic agents, such as ganciclovir or VCV providing a safety mechanism by which viral replication could be eliminated, if needed; and 4) the fact that HSV-1 never integrates into the host genome guarantees that the risk of insertional mutagenesis posed by RV vectors is not an issue with HSV-1. However, there are major challenges working with HSV-1. The genetic manipulation of HSV-1 is more difficult than that of AV due to the large size of the viral genome, and gene delivery could be affected due to pre-existing HSV immunity of the host (with as many as 90% of adults who have been exposed to HSV-1), and experience and interest in preclinical development by the biotechnology industry is limited. Moreover, the potential neurotoxicity of HSV-1 vectors could cause lifethreatening encephalitis from primary infection or from reactivation of latent virus.",

The combined effect of these pathways is to shut off or limit viral replication (i.e., the production of viral progeny) so that neighboring cells do not become targets of such progeny. In tumor cells, some or all of these cellular mechanisms may be disrupted because of their pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects.

A selection of clinical trials is summarized in Table 2 . The first study using therapy in glioma patients used stereotactic intratumoral inoculation of an RV vector carrying HSVtk in 15 patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors. 90 Although this study showed some promising results in terms of antitumor efficacy, it was not a controlled or randomized protocol. Two subsequent phase I and II studies in patients with recurrent GBM were performed using an RV/HSVtk approach followed by GCV administration. The virus was delivered via vector-producing cells that were injected during tumor resection. The first study involved 12 patients and no treatment-related adverse effects were noted. There was an overall median survival of 6.8 months, with three patients surviving longer than 12 months and one patient who was recurrence-free 2.8 years after treatment. 91 A comparable international, multicenter, uncontrolled study included 48 patients with recurrent gliomas. The median survival time was 8.6 months, with a 12-month survival rate of 27%. Tumor recurrence was absent on MRI in seven patients for at least 6 months and in two patients for 12 months, and one patient remained recurrence-free at 24 months. 92 A similar phase I study was performed in 12 children (aged 2 to 15 years) with recurrent malignant supratentorial tumors. This study also used an RV/HSVtk/ GCV approach. Disease progression occurred at a median time of 3 months after treatment, and the longest time until progression was 24 months with no adverse effects noted. 93 A large controlled phase III trial seemed necessary for an ultimate confirmation of the efficacy of the RV/HSVtk/GCV approach. This study used an adjuvant gene therapy protocol to the standard therapy of maximum surgical resection and irradiation for newly diagnosed GBM. After 4 years of follow-up of 248 patients who were divided into a gene therapy and a control arm, survival analysis showed no advantage of gene therapy in terms of tumor progression and overall survival. 94 There have been several clinical trials using AV vectors for malignant gliomas. Representative AV trials are briefly discussed herein. One clinical trial compared hu-mans with recurrent gliomas who were treated with direct stereotactic injection of either an RV vector or an AV vector that expressed the E. coli LacZ gene. 95 They showed that the latter showed more widespread distribution of gene expression, and thus they concluded that AV vectors may be superior in their ability to distribute the transferred gene into brain tumors. A phase I/II trial evaluated an AV vector expressing the HSVtk gene in patients with primary or recurrent high-grade gliomas. This study was performed in a controlled randomized fashion on 36 patients (i.e., 17 in the treatment arm and 19 in the control group). All patients underwent surgical resection and AV injection, followed by intravenous GCV on postoperative day 5 for 14 days. The control group underwent resection without gene therapy and GCV injections. The median survival in the gene therapy group was significantly longer than the control group (62 vs. 37 weeks). 96 As discussed previously, a large phase III trial has been conducted in Europe and Israel with this agent (Cerepro) and a recent statement from the company (Ark Therapeutics, Inc., London, United Kingdom) suggested evidence of efficacy, although published data would allow for independent evaluation of this claim. A recent phase I trial of AV-HSVtk delivered at the time of surgical resection of newly diagnosed malignant gliomas followed by oral VCV, combined with standard therapy (external field radiation to 6000 cGy and temozolomide) has also recently concluded, showing relative safety, whereas the data is maturing regarding any evidence of efficacy (Chiocca et al., unpublished data ). An AV vector delivering a wild-type copy of the p53 transgene was also evaluated in humans with recurrent gliomas. The vector was initially introduced by an implanted catheter placed in the middle of the tumor bed, followed by resection of the tumor to allow for studies related to p53 gene delivery and distribution. Again, while the treatment was well tolerated, the distribution of p53 gene into tumor was relatively low. 33 One recent trial evaluated an AV vector in 11 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma introduced by stereotactic injection, followed by surgical resection and an additional injection of the vector into the tumor bed. 43 The vector was well-tolerated in all but one patient who experienced confusion after the postoperative injection, which was believed to be caused by local brain toxicity. Tumor resection after the viral treatment demonstrated a dose-related inflammation and necrosis suggestive of a biologic effect from the transferred gene.",

Another clin- ical trial using a different HSV-1 mutant included 21 patients with recurrent glioma with similar results as they relate to safety. 83",

            "text": "The rapid evolution of recombinant DNA technology enables us to develop new therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy. However, screening of new approaches is based on animal models that are far from representative of the analogous clinical scenarios, as shown in the discrepancy between the experimental animal studies and the clinical trials. As for brain tumors, the size, consistency, and extent of tumor models do not reflect the large, necrotic, infiltrative nature of GBMs. Approaches that aim at immune enhancement but use animal models that are poorly syngeneic to the implanted tumor are unlikely to reliably predict the human response. Accordingly, many ingenious gene therapy strategies effective in pre-clinical studies may not fulfill their expectations in the clinic. Furthermore, the problem of the delivery of genetic vectors into solid brain tumors and efficient in situ gene transfer remains one of the most significant hurdles in gene therapy. The efficiency of transduction could be improved by modifying vectorproducing cells, such as migratory vector-producing cells, which have the ability to track even single tumor cells invading the surrounding brain tissue. 100, 101 The currently used manual injection of vectors, which is limited in volume and can be injected at any given time, and the efflux that occurs along needle tracks, might be improved by the use of three-dimensional neuronavigation techniques and convection-enhanced delivery methods; these delivery methods involve the infusion of therapeutic agents via surgically implanted catheters, and they use a pressure gradient to achieve a greater volume of distribution compared with that evident with diffusion alone. 102 The completed brain tumor gene therapy trials have offered some promising results. However, the results of most clinical studies have not lived up to the expectations created by experimental data. Although gene delivery to human patients seems to be safe, these studies have not yet translated into benefits in the clinic. At present, gene therapy is being studied in trials for brain tumors, and so far it is not available outside of a clinical trial.",
