COVID-19 has rapidly become a global public health threat, endangering the health and well-being of all people, but especially vulnerable older populations [13]. The pandemic is also causing social disruption, exceptional healthcare utilization, and economic instability worldwide. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently reported that for each month of containment, there is a loss of 2 percentage points in annual GDP (growth domestic product) growth. OECD further stated that the tourism sector alone is facing a decrease up to 70% [6].",

In addition, postoperative follow-up visits and rehabilitation were also reported to be drastically impaired (Fig. 2).",

Liebensteiner et al. found that 25% of the participating surgeons were still able to offer anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and 50% of the participants reported that rotator cuff repair was no longer being performed. Hardly any participants (< 1%) reported that even femoral fractures or sarcoma patients were postponed. In addition, similar to our findings, those authors reported drastic disruptions in postoperative follow-ups and rehabilitation facilities. In summary, the findings of that study are in good agreement with those of the current study.",

Our results also show that intensive care units as well as intermediate care units are the bottleneck during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 5). Hence, one can assume that this consequently leads to a reduction in revision arthroplasty procedures, even when a patient has a massively failed TJA. Reduction of surgical volume was also reported for urology and colorectal surgeries [4, 10]. Our results show a massive reduction in outpatient activities. A similar scenario was shown for urology patients [4].",

The overall goal of most governments in Europe was to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of new COVID cases and to avoid a collapse of the national healthcare systems [1]. At the close of the survey, there were 840,246 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe with 70,583 fatalities [18]. Affected by the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic, orthopaedic healthcare was substantially cut back on the whole continent. This drastic disruption has had a massive impact on TJA, which is currently the international standard of care for surgical treatment of degenerative and rheumatologic joint diseases, as well as for certain fractures adjacent to the joint, like femoral neck fractures [7]. Postponing TJA in patients with high-stage osteoarthritis leads to more opioid use and poorer overall outcome regarding revision rate and readmission rate after TJA [12]. However, at least life-threatening pathologies such as periprosthetic fractures and first-stage revisions of acute infected TJA can still be treated appropriately even in the present difficult scenario.",

Hence, the described cutback in arthroplasty services also has severe economic consequences for implant companies and their employees, as well as the families of the employees. TJA outcome is outstanding, and total hip arthroplasty has been named by several reports as \u201cthe operation of the century\u201d [8]. In Europe, more than 24 national joint registries with over 40 years of experience are monitoring the life expectancy of implants and are responsible for quality assessment and management in TJA [11]. The beneficial impact of TJA regarding mobility, social life, work capability, prevention of cardiovascular diseases, general health, patient satisfaction, decreasing pain and increasing joint function, especially in elderly persons, but nowadays in young active people as well, is undisputed. Hence, if access to TJA is restricted, the direct and indirect costs to a nation\u2019s society are enormous, because of early retirement, inability to work, direct costs to the healthcare systems caused by the immobility of people and indirect costs to the healthcare system, like employment status, earnings, time missed from work (or absenteeism), and disability payments [14]. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe influences our daily behaviour and prevention strategies [15]. As mentioned in our results, also most arthroplasty surgeons have contact with infected patients or infected hospital staff. Consequently, they change their attitude towards their families to prevent them from becoming infected with the disease. These lifestyle modifications range from affordable changes like washing and disinfecting the hands more often (87.1%) to significant changes like avoiding close physical contact with their families (22.1%), staying away from home (2.9%) or staying in a separate room at home (5.5%).",
