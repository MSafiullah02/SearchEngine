Until 2014, three members of the Alphacoronavirus genus such as porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are known to cause enteric and respiratory diseases of swine. More recently, a novel emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was demonstrated to be enteropathogenic and causes severe diarrhoea resemble those of PEDV and TGEV infections (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015), and mild interstitial pneumonia (Ma et al., 2015). Since the first report of PDCoV in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012), the virus is identified in the United States (Wang et al., 2014a,b), South Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014) and China (Song et al., 2015). In this study, we further report the presence and genetic characterization of PDCoV from cases showing symptoms of diarrhoea in Korean swine farms.",

The sampling locations were given in the Fig. S1. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was then converted into cDNA with the use of random hexamers and commercial RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premix kit (Clontech, Otsu, Japan) following the manufacturer's protocol. To enhance the specificity, two pairs of PDCoV primer were utilized. The first method designed primer set of reference (Woo et al., 2012). The other PDCoV\u2010specific primers were designed in this study, targeting a region of 587 bp of the nucleocapsid protein\u2010coding gene (PDCoV\u2010587F 5\u2032\u2010CCCAGCTCAAGGTTTCAGAG\u20103\u2032, PDCoV\u2010587R 5\u2032\u2010CCCAATCCTGTTTGTCTGCT\u20103\u2032). The thermal profile was initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 38 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The screening for other porcine enteric viruses was performed with pathogen\u2010specific primers using AccuPower\u00ae ProFi Taq PCR PreMix (Bioneer Ltd., Daejeon, Korea). The detection of Kobuvirus and group A rotavirus was following the previous studies (Reuter et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2013). For porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), we used i\u2010TGEV/PEDV Detection kit (iNtRON Ltd., Daejeon, Korea).",

PDCoV\u2010positive samples were amplified with primer sets (PDCoV\u2010SF2, PDCoV\u2010SR2 and PDCoV\u2010NF1, PDCoV\u2010NR1). The specific PCR bands were purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Daejeon, Germany), cloned utilizing TA cloning kit (Topcloner TA kit; Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea) and subsequently transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells (DH5\u03b1). The purified recombinant plasmids were sequenced by Macrogen Inc (Seoul, Korea). New sequences of PDCoV generated in this study were addressed in GenBank accession no. KR060082\u2013KR060085. The genetic relationship of two PDCoV strains (SL2, SL5) with other PDCoVs was inferred from a codon\u2010based alignment of 31 sequences of complete S gene (3483 bases) and 31 sequences of complete N gene (1029 bases). The details of the data set are summarized in Table S1. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by the maximum likelihood model with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in IQ\u2010TREE version 1.3.8 (Nguyen et al., 2015). The best\u2010fitting nucleotide substitution model for each alignment was determined automatically by specifying \u2018\u2010m TEST\u2019 option.",

It was on March 2015, PDCoV\u2010positive samples were detected in a 600\u2010scale sow farm (SL farm) in Gyeongbuk province. This farm was reported to be infected by PEDV in 2014 and had severe diarrhoea with 100% mortality in piglets. In early 2015, it was observed that up to 20% pigs of all ages had diarrhoea and 10% died. The diagnosis of porcine enteric viruses (Table 2) revealed the dual infection of PDCoV and PEDV, while TGEV, group A rotavirus and Kobuvirus were not detected. In the literature, it was reported that PDCoV co\u2010infected with others enteric viruses, such as: group C rotavirus (Marthaler et al., 2014), TGEV (Dong et al., 2015) and PEDV (Song et al., 2015). Combining the detection results of this study with the above\u2010mentioned reports, it could be inferred that PEDV was the most frequent co\u2010infected viruses.",

Of which, Korean strains of PDCoV isolated in 2014 (KNU14.04) and in 2015 (SL2 and SL5) were grouped within US PDCoV cluster; however, they located at different branches (highlights, Fig. 1a, b). Based on the S gene, the inferred ancestral amino acid changes along the nodes of the phylogeny (Fig. 2a) showed that the branches leading to Korean PDCoV isolates in 2014 and in 2015 shared 1 back substitution (node #40: Q106L, node #37: L106Q) and four unique substitutions (node #39: S697A, node #38: V550A, I669L and node #37: I1014V). However, the branch that leaded to 2015 isolates (SL2 and SL6) had further 2 mutations locating near the tip of the phylogeny (node #59: I110V, T582A). Based on the N gene, it was observed only amino acid mutations (six changes) near the tip of the phylogeny, on the node leading to SL2 and SL5 (Fig. 2b). The details of non\u2010synonymous substitutions at every node of the phylogeny can be found in Tables S2, S3. At present, the significance of these substitutions is almost obscured. Of the all, the phylogenetic analyses suggested that the PDCoVs strains (SL2, SL5) detected in early 2015 are different with the previously emerged virus (KNU14.04).",
