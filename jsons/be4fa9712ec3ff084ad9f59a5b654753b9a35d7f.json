[1] [2] [3] [4] The CDC has provided strategies for conserving PPE. [5] Despite these measures, PPE shortages are expected in many regions. [6] Telemedicine offerings are rapidly expanding, spurred by waivers expediting telemedicine credentialing and billing for most US providers [7] while relaxing device certification requirements. [8] As of March 30 th , these include emergency evaluation and management codes. Services (CMS) waiver released on March 30 th allows for MSEs to be performed using telehealth equipment during the pandemic. [10] This policy shift presents an opportunity for the use of electronic personal protective equipment (ePPE) to facilitate on-site ED MSEs without physical contact. This represents a novel strategy to maintain patient access to emergency evaluation and treatment while keeping providers safe and conserving PPE.",

Though ePPE toolkits overlap with telemedicine toolkits, ePPE is not telemedicine. We make this distinction because, unlike telemedicine, the provider is immediately available on-site to physically examine or resuscitate the patient if screening warrants such action. We liken this approach to the use of two-way phones on opposite sides of glass windows as used in banks and prisons. Instead of glass and phones, we advocate for tablets in environments where physical construction of such barriers is not feasible. As described below, this approach can fulfill EMTALA obligations for MSEs.",

[9] Telemedicine tools have been used safely in other settings. Telemedicine-based history and examination is reliable in the outpatient setting, and has been shown to be effective in diagnosing respiratory illness in children. [15] [16] [17] [18] One frequently raised concern is the difficulty of telemedicine-based auscultation without using remote digital stethoscopes. Auscultation of the lungs has been shown to have poor test characteristics for detecting pneumonia as compared with tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and overall clinical impression. [19] [20] [21] [22] Work of breathing assessed via videoconferencing serves as adequate respiratory examination in young, otherwise healthy patients without comorbid heart or lung disease. [17] We believe the benefits of forgoing auscultation during ePPE-based MSE far outweigh the risk given the pressing need to preserve PPE and minimize viral exposure. Greenhalgh et al. from the UK have proposed a structured telemedicine exam for respiratory complaints that is ideal for the described situation.",

Prior literature has discussed the implications of EMTALA in general. [26] [27] [28] [29] and for off-site emergency telemedicine. [30] Widely available pathways for ED-based telemedicine have not been established, with the notable exception of critical access hospitals. [31] There is little published historically on whether an ePPE-based MSE would qualify, though CMS guidance in anticipation of an Ebola outbreak in 2015 suggests that in highly infectious environments, MSEs could be performed via electronic means [32] : Within this context, we propose that MSEs facilitated by electronic means where both clinician and patient are physically present within the ED, but in separate rooms, would allow for rapid and effective evaluation while putting neither patient nor clinician at infectious risk and conserving physical PPE for sicker patients. A March 30 th CMS update to EMTALA enforcement allows for on-site and off-site MSEs by qualified medical personnel using telemedicine equipment supports this notion [10] :",
