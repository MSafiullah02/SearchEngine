Production of biofuels, especially cellulosic ethanol (Zhao et al. 2016), as well as biochemicals from these cellulosic biomass (Zhang et al. 2016a) has received considerable interest in the past decades.

Besides, genetic engineering of T. reesei has been conducted for more than 30 years, which benefits regulatory mechanisms studies on enzyme production and have achieved powerful cellulolytic mixtures by the fungus (Peterson and Nevalainen 2012).

Similar systems employing the trpC (Yelton et al. 1984) or acuD (Beri and Turner 1987) genes as the auxotrophic markers are also available. In addition, the niaD marker encoding the nitrate reductase was widely used to obtain the chlorate-resistant mutant, which has been successfully used in transformation of A. niger (Unkles et al. 1989). Moreover, the amdS gene (encoding acetamidase) was also employed as the nutritional markers for Aspergillus (Kelly and Hynes 1985) and thermophilic Myceliophthora (Liu et al. 2017) species by selecting for acetamide utilization, since acetamide is a poor nitrogen source for the wild-type strains.",

However, auxotrophic selection requires strains with specific mutations and culturing in specialized media, which may have negative effects on cell growth. In contrast, the positive resistance markers are nowadays widely applied in the studies of filamentous fungi transformation with the advantage of that the genotype of the recipient strains need not to be known in advance (Ruiz-D\u00edez 2002). The transformation method with the resistance markers is easy to operate, and vectors carrying the resistance marker gene cassette can be transformed into the recipient strains directly, and the mutants tolerate no background growth in the standard media. The hygromycin-B resistant marker was used in the early study of A. nidulans transformation (Punt et al. 1987) and T. reesei (Zhang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017a). The other frequently used selection resistance marker genes include pyrithiamine gene (ptrA) (Wang et al. 2013a), phleomycin gene (Chen et al. 2016), and phosphinothricin gene (Ahuja and Punekar 2008). However, the major drawback of using these kinds of resistance markers is that the resistance of the wild-type strains may not show significant dominance, resulting in selection difficulties. Moreover, some of those antibiotics are often expensive.",

Therefore, once the resistance marker was introduced, it would be integrated into the host genomic DNA, which was difficult to remove for a second round of genetic engineering. The Cre-loxP system has been developed as an important molecular tool to overcome these genetic limitations and also should reduce public concerns involving environmental release of resistant strains. The Cre recombinase from bacteriophage P1 of Escherichia coli catalyzes recombination between the two 34 bp loxP sites, each of them has two 13 bp Cre-binding sites which are interrupted by an 8 bp spacer region (Sternberg and Hamilton 1981). The system was first investigated in E. coli (Sternberg and Hamilton 1981) and utilized widely later in fungi, such as T. reesei (Steiger et al. 2011) and Aspergillus sp. (Forment et al. 2006). The expression of Cre recombinase was usually controlled by inducible promoters thus providing a means to switch on or off. In filamentous fungi, the xylanase promoter was frequently employed which can be induced by many kinds of carbohydrates, such as xylose and cellulose (Steiger et al. 2011; Forment et al. 2006). Moreover, Tet-on and Cre-loxP-based systems were successfully employed in P. oxalicum and Cre recombinase was activated by doxycycline which was controlled by the Tet-on system (Jiang et al. 2016).",

The cellulolytic and xylanolytic gene expression in T. reesei is coordinately regulated by the action of at least four transcriptional activators (Xyr1, Ace2, Ace3, and Hap2/3/5 complex) and three repressors (Cre1, Ace1, and the recently reported regulator Rce1) (reviewed by Seiboth et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2017). Xyr1 (xylanase regulator 1) is the key positive transcriptional activator; and lack of xyr1 eliminates the induction of cellulase and xylanase by all known inducers (Stricker et al. 2006). Cre1 is the major negative regulator mediating carbon catabolite repression (CCR) by inhibiting both basal and the inducible expressions, and moreover also prevents xyr1 gene expression. In T. reesei, cre1 transcription was autoregulated under non-inducing conditions, and xyr1 gene was therefore shown at a low basal level (Lichius et al. 2014). Overexpression of xyr1 improved glycoside hydrolase production under inducing conditions, while deletion of cre1 eliminated CCR, but the catabolic de-repression was not sufficient to increase glycoside hydrolase production, suggesting that hyperproduction is still inducer dependent (Wang et al. 2013b; Nakari-Setala et al. 2009).",

In the recent studies in our group, the designed artificial zinc finger transcription factor containing various DNA-binding domain and Gal4 effector domain was introduced into T. reesei Rut-C30, and cellulase hyper producer was screened. One of the mutants showed a 55% rise in filter paper activity and an 8.1-fold increased \u03b2-glucosidase activity (Zhang et al. 2016c). The scheme of the strain development using the artificial zinc finger protein was elucidated in Fig. 2.1. Interestingly, we found elevation of Trvib-1 in the selected mutant, and we tested further the effect of its overexpression on cellulase production in T. reesei Rut-C30. Vib-1 was reported to exert control of cellulase production in N. crassa (Xiong et al. 2014), and it was found that Trvib-1, the homologous gene of vib-1 from T. reesei, can complement the deletion of vib-1 in N. crassa. We found improvement of cellulase production in T. reesei Rut-C30 by overexpression of Trvib-1 (Zhang et al. 2018), and the involvement of this gene in regulation of cellulase production was also reported by another group (Ivanova et al. 2017). Therefore, novel regulatory mechanisms can be revealed by studying the mutant carrying the artificial transcription factor. It can also be expected that in the future, more artificial transcription factors can be used to modulate cellulase production in filamentous fungi.\n",

Freely suspended mycelia and pellets with varying sizes can be found commonly in different filamentous fungal cultures. Although there are still some debates on the relationship of morphology and enzyme productivity, positive correlation of morphology with enzyme production was reported in T. reesei (Novy et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2012), N. crassa (Sun et al. 2014), and A. niger (Driouch et al. 2011). For example, relatively higher agitation speed increased pellet diameter and cellulase productivity of T. reesei Rut-C30, and on the other hand, cellulase activity and cell viability were sensitive to impeller shear (Yu et al. 2012). It is therefore important to control balanced pellet morphology, which is influenced by many process parameters, including medium composition, inoculation size, culture mode, pH value, temperature, osmolality, aeration, and so on (Krull et al. 2013). It was discussed that properly controlled pellet size and inner structures allowed a reduced viscosity and facilitate oxygen mass transfer (Driouch et al. 2011). So far many related studies of morphological control focused on process optimization, and very little is known on the underlying molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks. Recently, studies using 95 morphology mutants of N. crassa revealed that improved cellulase production and protein secretion was achieved in pellet-forming mutants, but not in the mutants with long hyphae (Sun et al. 2014). Until now, no similar report on other filamentous fungi was found. It will be interesting to explore whether genetic engineering can be applied to finely modulate the morphology of filamentous fungi for efficient production of cellulosic enzymes.",

In addition to Cas9, new effector protein Cpf1 was also developed and employed for genome editing (Zetsche et al. 2015). Although so far there is no report using Cpf1 in filamentous fungi, it is expected that novel effector proteins including Cpf1 will be utilized to improve efficiency of genome engineering of this important group of fungi. The sgRNA provides a 17\u201320 bp guide sequence that defines the target DNA, and the guide sequence was found adjacent a DNA motif (the PAM, protospacer adjacent motif) of three bases (NGG or TTN). The sgRNA binds to the effector protein and targets a specific locus in the recipient genome, where a double-strand break (DSB) will be introduced. The DSB can then be repaired by the host cell repair systems. In most cases, DSB is fixed by the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism (Fuller et al. 2015; Pohl et al. 2016). This can lead to random insertions or deletions within the target sequence. If a DNA share homology flanks closing to the DSB (a so-called donor DNA, dDNA) is available, homologous recombination (HR) will happen. And then the donor DNA can either replace or modify the target gene. Thus, the CRISPR systems can be used both for the deletion and insertion of genes (Pohl et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2017), resulting in marker-free gene disruption, deletion, or insertion (Doudna and Charpentier 2014).",

For the expression of Cas9, two main strategies, in vitro and in vivo, have been established. In the case of in vitro, the Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex was formed in vitro to edit the target genes (Pohl et al. 2016). In the case of in vivo, the codon of Cas9 gene followed by a stronger NLS should be optimized for expression in filamentous fungi (Matsu-Ura et al. 2015; Fuller et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015). In addition, different promoter systems also influence the expression of Cas9. When the strong constitutive promoters were used, the efficiency of genome editing should be improved; however, this way may lead to possible off-target effects. In order to realize the controllability of this system, some inducible promoters have been selected to inhibit Cas9 expression for minimal off-target effects (Liu et al. 2015; Pohl et al. 2016).",

            "text": "In addition to optimizing the expression of Cas9 gene, looking for optimal functional sgRNA modules was also very important (Schuster et al. 2016). The synthetic sgRNA needs to be transcribed using RNA polymerase III promoters (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2015). However, these promoters are poorly defined in filamentous fungi. For the expression of sgRNAs, two main strategies, in vitro and in vivo, have also been established. In some organisms, such as the T. reesei and A. niger, sgRNAs were generated in vitro and then co-transformed to the protoplasts together with a Cas9 gene expression cassette or the Cas9 protein (Zhang et al. 2016b). This strategy is suitable for almost all organisms. However, the stability of sgRNAs should be taken into consideration. It has been reported that RNA polymerase III promoters such as SNR52 and U6 and some tRNA promoters can be applied to transcribe sgRNAs in some of filamentous fungi, such as N. crassa and P. chrysogenum (Fuller et al. 2015; Matsu-Ura et al. 2015; Schuster et al. 2016). However, due to uncertainty of genome sequence and the complexity of genetic background, the endogenous RNA polymerase III promoters from filamentous fungi are difficult to be identified or not suitable for sgRNA transcription. Thus, the most common method to express sgRNAs in vivo is to use 5\u2032-end hammerhead (HH) and 3\u2032-end hepatitis delta virus (HDV) to flank the sgRNA (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2015), and then RNA polymerase II promoter can be used to express sgRNAs.",

It enables marker-free engineering of the strain, therefore facilitating metabolic engineering of the strain by manipulating multiple genes. Fourth, it is not toxic. No difference of cell growth and sporulation was observed when cells were expressing Cas9 (Liu et al. 2017).",
