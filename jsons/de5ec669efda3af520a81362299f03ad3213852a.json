            "text": "Background: In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is generally recommended and has proven its benefits by reducing endotracheal intubation (ETI) rates, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, complications, and mortality. Choosing between immediate ETI or NIV trial is often difficult when such patients present with an altered mental status. Some guidelines recommend avoiding NIV when consciousness is impaired given the risk of aspiration, and some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is highly predictive of NIV failure. Though clinical response to a well-adjusted NIV treatment can be both swift and spectacular, these contraindications probably encourage physicians to proceed to immediate ETI. Some studies indeed report that NIV was not even considered in as many as 60% of patients who might have benefited from this therapy, though ETI related complications might have been avoided had NIV been successfully applied. Case presentation: We report two cases of ARF in COPD patients who were successfully treated by NIV in prehospital setting and avoided ETI despite contraindications (altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale < 8) and failure risk factors (severe respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.25). Conclusion: In COPD patients presenting ARF, NIV trial could be considered even when relative contraindications such as an altered level of consciousness or a severe respiratory acidosis are present.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is a well-known indication for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) trial [1] . The benefits provided by this therapy are numerous and well-studied, the most prominent being reductions in mortality as well as in endotracheal intubation (ETI) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates [2, 3] . The main contraindication to NIV is the need for emergent ETI, considered to be mandatory when consciousness is severely impaired, when the patient is unable to cooperate, or when the airways need to be protected because of a high aspiration risk [4] . Unfortunately, COPD patients with ARF often meet these criteria because of hypercapnic coma, and the role of NIV in this setting is therefore still debated [5, 6] . Furthermore, some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is linked to a high risk of NIV failure event if a trial might still be considered [7, 8] . The underutilization of NIV in hypercapnic COPD exacerbations suggested by some reports might be at least partially due to these contraindications, which could encourage physicians to immediately proceed with ETI [9] .",

When prehospital providers arrived on site, the patient was unconscious (GCS 3) and in severe respiratory distress with central cyanosis, rapid/shallow breathing. The pulsed oxygen saturation was of 70% under supplementary oxygen (6 L/min) through nasal cannula. He was hemodynamically stable. Ventilation using a bag-valve mask was quickly initiated, and arterial blood gas obtained, showing severe respiratory acidosis (pH 7.07, pCO 2 > 17.0 kPa, pO 2 40.1 kPa, bicarbonates not recorded due to equipment error). The patient had signed a legal document asking not to be resuscitated nor intubated. A bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation NIV trial was started, and both intravenous aspirin and unfractionated heparin were administered. Constant medical surveillance was provided during transport. Upon arrival in the ER after 30 min of NIV, the patient had a GCS of 14.

Pulmonary embolism was ruled out by CT scan and, because of chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers, coronary catheterization was performed showing chronic proximal anterior-interventricular artery occlusion that was treated by stenting.

The first patient presented with ARF induced by benzodiazepine intoxication, while the second patient had a COPD exacerbation probably precipitated by NSTEMI, assuming that cardiac ischemia was not a consequence of severe hypoxia. In both cases, we believe that clinical improvement was entirely due to NIV as it was the only effective treatment administered by the prehospital team. Indeed, no flumazenil was given to the first patient despite probable benzodiazepine intoxication, and the second patient was given aspirin and heparin, but no nitrates, diuretics, or inotropic medication. Even if these two patients presented with ARF of different etiologies, their clinical picture at first medical contact was similar. They both had baseline advanced COPD, a pH < 7.25, and a GCS < 8. Within the first hour, respiratory acidosis regressed (with a pH increase of 0.14 and 0.17 respectively) and neurological status improved (with GCS improving from 6 to 10 and from 3 to 14 respectively) in both cases, making it possible to avoid ETI. For the first patient, NIV was tried because of the potential harmful effects of ETI and mechanical ventilation in the context of advanced COPD. Conversely, while the second patient undoubtedly met criteria for immediate ETI, the procedure was not performed to respect his will. Nevertheless, clinical improvement was even more spectacular in this case, with the patient recovering an almost normal level of consciousness in only 30 min.",
