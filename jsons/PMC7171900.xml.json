Health is a major sector of any economy and often employs more people in the industrialized countries than any other industry. Health has complex networks of services and provider agencies, including funding through public or private insurance or through national health service systems. Whether insurance is provided by the state or through private and public sources combined, skilled management is required at the macro- or national and the micro- or local level, including the many institutions that make up the system. Management training of public health professionals and clinical services personnel is a requisite and not a luxury.",

Modern and successful public health also must address social, economic, and community determinants of health and the promotion of public policies and individual behaviors for health and well-being. The social capital and norms that promote cooperation among people are the basis of a \u201ccivil society\u201d (i.e., the totality of voluntary, civic, and social organizations and institutions of a functioning society alongside the structures of governmental and commercial institutions). Health systems are ideally knowledge- and evidence-based in using technologies available in medicine and the environment to promote the health and well-being of a population, including security against the effects of threatened terrorism, growing social isolation, and inequities in health. Management in health can learn much from concepts of business management that have evolved to address the economic and human resource aspects of a health system at the macrolevel or an individual unit of service at the microlevel.",

As a governmental priority, health may be influenced by political ideology, sometimes reflecting societal attitudes of the party in power and sometimes apparently at odds with its general social policy. Following Bismarck\u2019s introduction in Germany in 1881 of national health insurance for workers and their families, funded by both workers and their employers, most countries in the industrialized world introduced variants of this national health plan. Usually, this has been at the initiative of socialist or liberal political leadership, but conservative political parties have preserved national health programs once implemented. Despite the new conservatism since the 1990s with its pre-eminent ideology of market forces, the growing roles for national, state, and local authorities in health have led to a predominantly government role in financing and overall responsibility for health care, even where there is no universal national health system, as in the USA. The UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), initiated by a Labour government in 1948, has survived through many changes of government, including the conservative Margaret Thatcher period in which many national industries and services were privatized.",

Traditionally, there are competing priorities between the hospital and medical sector and the public health and community programs sector.

This realization has led to the implementation of universal access systems in most of the industrialized countries. Once initiated, national health systems require high levels of resources, because the health system is labor intensive with relatively high salaries for health care professionals. In these countries, health expenditures consume between 7 and nearly 18 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Some industrialized countries, notably those in the former Soviet bloc, lacking mechanisms for advocacy, including consumer and professional opinion, tended to view health with a political objective of social benefits, and also as a \u201cnon-productive\u201d consumer of resources rather than a producer of new wealth. As a result, budget allocations and total expenditures for health as a percentage of GDP were well below those of other industrialized countries (Figure 12.1\n). Salaries for health personnel in the Semashko system were low compared to industrial workers in the \u201cproductive\u201d sectors.

However, Russian health expenditure in 2011 was still only 6.2 percent of GDP and there is a lingering idea of health being a non-productive investment.

Further decline in the uninsured population is expected as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, or \u201cObamacare\u201d) comes into effect in the coming years, bringing many millions of Americans into health insurance and meeting federal standards of fair practices such as eliminating exclusion for pre-existing conditions by private insurers. The PPACA comes into effect on 1 January 2014 and will guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions, and ensure that premiums cannot vary based on gender or medical history. It will subsidize the cost of coverage, and new state-based health insurance exchanges will help consumers to find suitable policies. It will introduce many preventive care measures into public and private insurance plans, and will promote efficiencies in the health systems including reduction in fraudulent claims and wasteful funding systems. All of this will require skilled management in the components of the health system (see Chapters 10 and 13Chapter 10Chapter 13).",

Mayo began with industrial engineering studies of the effect of increased lighting on production at an assembly line. This was followed by other improvements in working conditions, including reduced length of the working day, longer rest periods, better illumination, color schemes, background music, and other factors in the physical environment. These studies showed that production increased with each of these changes and improvements. However, the researchers discovered, to their surprise, that production continued to increase when the improvements were withdrawn. Furthermore, in a control group where conditions remained the same, productivity also grew during the study period.

Massachusetts and Connecticut alone of all the states continued to ban birth control. But with the advent of the birth control pill in the 1960s, the issue was reopened. Richard Cardinal Cushing, head of the Archdiocese of Boston, no longer opposed a change in the state law, although still opposed the practice of birth control.Some Catholic doctors, including Dr John Rock, the gynecologist who conducted the key clinical studies of the birth control pill, favored a change in the law. An article published by a young Catholic doctor, later specializing in public health, in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine in 1964, called for changing the Massachusetts birth control law. This drew the ire of some of the hierarchy of the Church.However, the article served to stimulate the Legislature to revisit the law, leading to its repeal in 1966, thus allowing use of all methods of birth control. The controversy subsided and women were free to control their own fertility as a result of this advocacy.Sources: Dorsey JL, Emeritus Clinical Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

As commercial programs have evolved during the past 5 years, the categories of providers (clinicians, hospitals, and other health care facilities), number of measures, and dollar amounts at risk have increased. This method of payment is likely to be promoted in the Affordable Care Act implementation to improve quality and control cost increases in US health care (see Chapters 10, 11, and 13Chapter 10Chapter 11Chapter 13). Pay-for-performance has also been adopted in other countries trying to improve quality of care, such as Macedonia (Lazarevik and Kasapinov, 2012).",

Thus, managers of hospitals and other health facilities need broad-based training in a New Public Health in order to understand the interrelationships of services, funding, and population health. Managers who continue to work with an obsolescent paradigm with the traditional emphasis, regardless of the larger picture, may find the hospital non-competitive in a new climate where economic incentives promote downsizing institutions and upgrading health promotion. Defensive, internalized management will become obsolete, while forward-looking management will be the pioneers of the New Public Health. This may be seen as a systems approach to improve population and individual health, based on strategic planning for immediate needs and adaptation of health systems in the longer term issues in health.",

Alzheimer\u2019s disease burdens an increasing number of our Nation\u2019s elders and their families, and it is essential that we confront the challenge it poses to our public health.\u201dUS President Barack Obama\nAction PlanOn 4 January 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act (NAPA), requiring the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the National Alzheimer\u2019s Project to:\u2022Create and maintain an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).\u2022Coordinate Alzheimer\u2019s disease research and services across all federal agencies.\u2022Accelerate the development of treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD.\u2022Improve early diagnosis and coordination of care and treatment of AD.\u2022Improve outcomes for ethnic and racial minority populations that are at higher risk for AD.\u2022Coordinate with international bodies to fight AD globally.\nThe law also establishes the Advisory Council on Alzheimer\u2019s Research, Care, and Services and requires the Secretary of HHS, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to create and maintain a national plan to overcome AD.Goals and Strategies for 2025Research funds are being allocated towards that end. Education for health providers, strengthening of the workforce, for direct care and for public health guidelines for management of AD, education and support for caring families, addressing special housing needs for AD patients and many other initiatives are proposed in this comprehensive approach to a growing public health problem. Enhancing public awareness is crucial to achieve the goals set out in this plan.Source: Department of Health and Human Services. National plan to address Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

These functions are applicable at all levels of management, from policy to operational management of a production or a service system. Creative management of health systems is vital to the functioning of the system at the macrolevel, as well as in the individual department or service.

Good management means designing objectives based on a balance between the feasible and the desirable.
