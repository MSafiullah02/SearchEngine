MxA could not discriminate between a GAS and non-GAS aetiology of pharyngitis, mainly because streptococcal and viral co-infection induced an MxA response comparable to that of virus infection. Because GAS can be detected relatively easily in throat swabs, there is probably no clinical need for a biomarker in the routine diagnostics of GAS pharyngitis. Here, we studied the biomarkers primarily to assess the pathogenic role of detected viruses or bacteria, not to evaluate their performance in differential diagnostics in clinical practice. However, the MxA level and MxA/CRP ratio remained low in patients with sole streptococcal infection and increased in the majority of patients with a virus infection. Therefore, they could be helpful tools in the differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections in other clinical settings. In our study, blood level of TRAIL, another virus specific biomarker, was less accurate in differentiating between viral and bacterial aetiology.",

Moreover, patient recruitment continued only for 14 months, and epidemiological variation might have influenced the etiological outcomes. Additionally, the sample size was rather small. Several different ED physicians carried out the preliminary recruitment of the patients, which could have influenced the diagnostic accuracy of pharyngitis. However, our setting pragmatically reflects how the clinicians identify febrile pharyngitis. Furthermore, we could possibly have increased the detection rate of viruses by collecting also nasopharyngeal swab samples.41, 42 Our rationale for sole oropharyngeal sampling was that we were investigating pharyngeal infection and that nasopharyngeal sampling might have increased the detection of viruses with a questionable role in causing pharyngeal symptoms.",
