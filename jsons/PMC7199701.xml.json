            "text": "COVID-19 is one of the deadly pandemics, the transmission and nature of COVID-19 is not known. The outbreak of COVID-19 started from Wuhan city, capital of Hubei province of China (Raibhandari et al, 2020) in the month of December 2019. The virus gradually spread across neighbouring countries, including South Korea and Japan. With the outbreak of Coronavirus, migrants (students and workers) from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Iran, Pakistan and other countries; returned to their home countries. In some countries, returning migrants were kept in isolation camp for 14 days, whereas, in a few countries including Iran, there were no testing, and consequently, the spread of the virus increased. In Italy, due to return of Chinese workers, the Coronavirus slowly spread and the northern parts of Italy were badly infected (https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/?cbps=1). In US, visitors from China and Europe and US tourists, returning from China/Europe, initially caused infections in major cities: King County in Seattle city, Los Angeles and New York City, and now almost all the states in US are suffering with Coronavirus. In China, Beijing and Shanghai cities were locked immediately when the virus spread, Italy decided to lock in the month of March. In many US cities, partial lockdown was imposed in the beginning of March and later complete lockdown was started in the first week of April. As of 20 March 2020, lockdown was observed in California state, higher education institutions were asked to have online classes and the company employees started working from home. After seeing the spread of COVID-19 infection in other countries, the Prime Minister of India, announced Janata (People\u2019s) Curfew on 22 March 2020 in whole nation, cancelling, all the domestic and international flights, trains, bus and almost roads were deserted. After its success, a complete lockdown was announced until 14 April 2020. Such Lockdown is the prime non-pharmaceutical aid to break the chain of COVID-19 (Long, 2020). In India, the complete lockdown is now extended until 3 May 2020 to curb the spread of infection through complete stop of movement of people and also this has helped to maintain criteria of \u201csocial distancing\u201d. This is an important move by the Prime Minister of India especially when the country lacks resources and medical facilities. The total lockdown has raised chaos among people, but it has cut down the emissions of particulate matter and greenhouse gas concentrations. We have carried out analysis of PM2.5 in various cities in India and also in major cities around the world, where partial or complete lockdown have been observed. Our results show a pronounced improvement in air quality due to total lockdown in India and partial reduction in the anthropogenic sources in many cities of the world where people are highly affected by the coronavirus.",

The size of the virus is about 70-90 nm, smaller than the size of smoke and dust aerosols (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045880/). Efforts are being undertaken to find out the characteristics and behaviour of this virus. Infected people, while sneezing, droplets are dispersed in the air and it affect other people close by (Wang and Du, 2020). Scientists are busy in carrying out lab and modelling studies to understand the nature and behaviour of this novel corona virus and its transmission. Currently, social isolation seems to be one of the prime solutions to keep away from COVID-19 infection (Long, 2020). Everyone is trying to maintain social distancing of 6 ft with others so that the probability of transmission can be reduced.",

All the PurpleAir sensors are well calibrated and the PM25 data are very comparable with EPA sensors deployed in US Embassies around the world. We have made comparison of PM2.5 data observed in Delhi US Embassy through US EPA and PurpleAir sensor data in Delhi and observed a strong correlation (R2=0.80). These sensors are located across the world and data sets are freely available to anyone. PM2.5 data from Rome-Vaticon is available since December 2018 and data from La Puebla de Alrinden is available from December 2019. Table 1\nprovides sources of data considered in the present study. We have also carried out rainfall data available through Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com/history) for cities considered in the present study. The rainfall data are available in near real time and earlier months. These data have been used widely by scientific community. The data are updated on the website through observations made at the airports worldwide.",

In some of the cities, and country, partial to complete lockdown were started beginning from January. In the month of March 2020 all the cities considered in the present study observed lockdown, although degree of the lockdown varies. In US, even during no lockdown, people did stay in their houses and tried to maintain \u201csocial distancing\u201d, limit of 6 ft. The traffic on the roads were reduced but the flights, buses and essential services were not stopped. The decline in PM2.5 compared with other years is attributed to the decline in in traffic in US and also in many cities of the world considered in the present study, except in India where complete lockdown (no domestic and international flights, no trains, complete closure of small and big shopping centres and industry) was observed. The decline in different months in different cities in some countries reflect partial lockdown in different months where large number of people suffer from COVID-19 especially in the month of February and March 2020. In USA, a partial lockdown was observed in the month of March as a result, a linear decline in PM2.5 was observed in New York and Los Angeles in the month of March 2020 (Figure 2\n). The average PM2.5 concentrations in New York, is 9.48 \u03bcg/m3 during December 2019 to March 2020. In New York city, pronounced linear reduction (32%) is seen in PM2.5 during March 2020 compared with March 2019, and 20% with compared to February 2020. In New York, PM2.5 was reduced due to rainfall in the month of March 2020 (Figure 2). In Los Angeles, 4% reduction in PM2.5 is observed during March 2020 with respect to March 2019, about 30% compared with February 2020.

Many nations ordered for the total lockdown within city or state or in whole country (e.g. India). Such conditions helped in improving the air quality which is directly reflected by the decline in PM2.5. The decline also suggests less movement of traffic, which directly shows lockdown and observing social distancing. Here, we have not discussed about the greenhouse emissions monitored using ground sensors in most of the cities, and such data are available through satellite also. A preliminary data analysis shows pronounced decline in the greenhouse emissions in most of the cities due to complete lockdown when practically no traffic on the roads. Such reduction in greenhouse emissions will have local, regional and global impact in radiation budget which will have a long-term impact on climate.",
