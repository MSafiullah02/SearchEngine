High levels of Ang II can lead to increases in vascular permeability and pulmonary oedema (Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008; Marshall 2003; Marshall et al. 2004) . In mouse models of acute respiratory distress syndrome, ACE2 knockout mice displayed more severe symptoms, while overexpression of ACE2 had some protective effects . In SARS-CoV infection of mice, both viral replication and the viral spike protein alone have been shown to selectively reduce ACE2 but not ACE expression ). In addition, SARS-CoV also induces rapid downregulation of ACE2 from the cell surface (Glowacka et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2008 ) and the release of catalytically active ACE2 ectodomains (Haga et al. 2008; Jia et al. 2009; Lambert et al. 2005) . These results suggest that the physiological balance between ACE/ACE2 and Ang II/Ang-(1-7) is likely disrupted by SARS-CoV viral infection. This virus-mediated effect likely has a pathogenic role in lung injury (Imai et al. 2008; Kuba et al. 2006; Yamamoto et al. 2006) . Indeed, injection of SARS-CoV spike protein into mice led to a significant increase in Ang II levels in the lung tissue and exacerbated acid-induced acute lung injury . Results from these previous animal studies suggested a possible mechanism of how SARS-CoV infection may cause severe lung failure, which is likely mediated through high levels of Ang II resulting from the inhibition of ACE2 by the viral spike protein.",

This perspective is intended to stimulate discussions about possible pathogenic mechanisms, based on the interaction of the virus with its receptor ACE2, so that rational therapies can be developed. Although ACE is regarded as the primary Ang II-converting enzyme, another enzyme, chymase, is also involved in converting Ang II in certain pathological conditions that may need attention (Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008; Lindberg et al. 1997 ). In addition, coronavirus pathogenesis is a highly complex process (Lo et al. 2006) , and much of the needed detail in host-pathogen interaction in 2019-nCoV infection awaits investigation. It also remains to be clinically tested whether some of these potential treatments, as proposed here, can be effective or beneficial in the management of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury. Fig. 1 Potential therapeutics for 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury based on balancing the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Activation of the RAS cascade involves Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to generate Ang I, which is then converted to Ang II by ACE. Ang II binds to its receptors (AT1 and AT2) to exert local and systemic effects such as vasoconstriction and promotion of the release of aldosterone. ACE2 functions as a counter-regulatory enzyme for balancing responses initiated from ACE. ACE2 hydrolyses Ang I and Ang II to generate Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) binding to the MAS receptor antagonizes Ang II-mediated actions. SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV use ACE2 as the entry receptor. Inhibition of ACE2 expression or downregulation of surface ACE2 by these coronaviruses may disrupt function balances between ACE/ACE2, which may be alleviated by different approaches (from A to D).",
