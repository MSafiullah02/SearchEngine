Particle size and the local airway host immune response determine which inhaled viruses and particles will adhere to epithelial surfaces and persist in the airways [1], [2]. The lungs and lower respiratory tract have generally been considered sterile in the absence of respiratory disease although very little is known about the microbiota of the upper and lower airways of non-diseased individuals. Microbes and viruses, including phage, have been implicated in chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis (CF) [3]\u2013[8]. However, most of this work has been performed using standard microbial cultures and PCR-based studies, which provide an incomplete picture of the airway microbiota and little opportunity for viral discovery compared to metagenomic techniques.",

Viruses are the most numerous and diverse biological entities on Earth, and metagenomics has been used extensively to describe viral communities in marine ecosystems [9]\u2013[12]. The first metagenomic studies of the human microbiome were of viruses in blood, feces, and the lungs, and went far to describe previously unexplored viral communities [13]\u2013[17]. Recent metagenomic studies of the human microbiome have largely focused on microbial populations, predominantly in the gut and the surface of the skin [18]\u2013[21].",

CF affects paranasal sinuses as well as the lower respiratory, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and lower gastro-intestinal tracts [23]. The current median age of survival for individuals with CF is approximately 38 years. Over 80% of CF mortalities are attributable to respiratory failure from chronic bacterial infections of the lungs, most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia\n[4], [24]. Individuals with CF have impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) which results in airway mucus plugging [2]\n[25]\n[2]. This creates hypoxic microenvironments, forcing invasive microbial species to adapt [2]. This unique airway environment is believed to increase viral replication and susceptibility to viral infections in individuals with CF [8], [22]. Expectorated sputum provides a sample of airway secretions from the proximal airways. Sputum also contains material from the entire respiratory tract including airway mucus, cellular debris, DNA, and degraded proteins as well as microbes, their associated phage, and eukaryotic viruses [26], [27].",

CF viromes had more tBLASTx similarities to phage genomes overall than Non-CF viromes, and were similar to a wider range of phage (Figure 1, Table S2). The tBLASTx analysis identified a core set of 19 phage genomes which had similarities to sequences in all metagenomes (Table S3). An additional 12 genomes had significant similarities to viromes from all CF individuals but none of the Non-CF individuals. This suggests a core set of phage characteristic of the human respiratory tract, and an additional core group in CF individuals. A few phage genomes appeared to dominated the Non-CF2, Non-CF3, and Non-CF5 viromes when tBLASTx similarities to phage genomes were plotted against the Phage Proteomic Tree (Figure 1). Over 90% of tBLASTx hits to phage in Non-CF2 were to Streptococcus phage Cp-1, and 80% of tBLASTx similaritites in Non-CF3 were attributable to two phage, Haemophilus influenza phage HP-1 and Brucella melitensis 16 M BrucI prophage. The large relative abundance of these phage may reflect their prevalence in inhaled air, since environmental air has been shown to contain diverse bacterial communities [29].",

More specifically, Non-CF2, NonCF3, and Non-CF5 all had positive values for the first principal component (0.40, 0.42, and 0.27 respectively) while all other metagenomes had negative values. This was driven by a large positive loading of the first principal component by the Streptococcus phage Cp-1, which segregated Non-CF2, and negative loadings on the set of phage genomes shared by Non-CF1Asthma, Non-CF4Spouse and the CF metagenomes. Additionally, the second principal component was positively loaded by the Brucella melitensis 16 M phi Bruc1 prophage genome which was nearly absent in Non-CF2, giving a negative value of the second principal component for Non-CF2.",

In CF individuals, phage communities are driven by airway pathology, and correspond to a shared internal respiratory environment. The phage community in the Non-CF4Spouse virome reflects a continuous sampling of CF-associated phage via a shared external environment. Common phage taxonomy in CF individuals and Non-CF1Asthma occurs because of shared respiratory pathology (i.e., similar internal environments). Both CF and asthma are conditions marked by impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) [2], [25], [30]. MCC is slowed in asthma, leading to increased retention of microbes and hence their phage [30]. In CF, mucus is extremely viscous and stagnant, forming obstructive plugs, and creating hypoxic microenvironments that serve as scaffolds for bacterial biofilm formation [2], [25]. Therefore, in both asthma and CF, phage communities are derived from microbes which persist in the airways for longer periods of time than in healthy individuals.",

The higher abundance of Staphylococcus phage in CF is consistent with the increased induction of Staphylococcus prophage by antibiotics in CF individuals, as shown by previous studies [31]. P. aeruginosa was cultured from the sputum of all CF participants, yet Pseudomonas phage were not abundant in the metagenomes. Pseudomonas phage may be of novel types not closely related to those in the database, making them undetectable by tBLASTx. Even if known phage are present, infections of Pseudomonas in CF may be unsuccessful, since phage may not be able to penetrate the biofilm to access susceptible microbial hosts [32]. Alternatively, P. aeruginosa may not be as abundant in the CF airway as indicated by culturing, an idea supported by 16S rDNA and Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of bacteria in CF sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [33]\u2013[35]. T-RFLP uses fluorescently labeled 5\u2032 PCR primers coupled with restriction digests to allow for rapid profiling of unknown microbial communities, providing a less biased picture of microbial diversity than culture-based studies [35].",

The estimated number of DNA viral species has been reported to be as low as 1440 in hot springs, and as high as 129,000 in the open ocean [9], [37]. In comparison with other environmental viromes, the respiratory tract viromes had low species richness. Similarly, Rogers et al. [34] found low diversity of Bacteria in CF sputum using T-RFLP analysis. Low species richness probably results from physical and biological barriers to microbial and viral persistence, including both MCC as well as innate and adaptive immunity [2], [38]. Richness may be further depressed in CF individuals because of antibiotic therapies and the metabolic adaptations required for microbial and viral survival in the unique microenvironment of the CF airway [26], [27].",

This was largely driven by the general absence of ssDNA and Retro-transcribing viruses from Non-CF viromes (Figure 4A). Principal components for CF viromes were more variable, reflecting the tendency for CF viromes to have a small number (between one and four) of highly abundant viral species. Specifically, the outlying behavior of CF2 was driven by a high positive loading of the second principal component by the Geminivirus Sugarcane streak Egypt virus. CF4 did not cluster with other metagenomes due to a high negative loading of the first principal component by Reticuloendotheliosis virus.",

The majority of respiratory infections (>75%) have been attributed to RNA viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses, so many previous studies have focused on the characterization of RNA viruses in the respiratory tract [38]. CF is predominantly a microbial disease, and phage are known to exert important top-down controls on microbial communities [52]. However, little work has been done to describe phage communities and DNA viruses associated with CF or with the airways in general [4], [38]. Over 98% of all completely sequenced phage have DNA genomes, therefore to assess phage diversity, taxonomy, and function, it was necessary to isolate viral DNA [53]. Future studies of the respiratory tract virome should be expanded to include characterization of RNA viral communities.",

The non-diseased airway virome contains a set of shared core metabolic functions, which deviate strongly in the face of chronic disease. These deviations are driven by dramatic environmental changes in the airways, induced by the nature of cystic fibrosis, such as the introduction of hypoxic microenvironments and novel carbon sources [26], [27]. In cases where phage taxonomy was shared between Non-CF and CF individuals, metabolic functions still remained distinct. The converse was also true, that is, even when Non-CF viromes differed in phage and eukaryotic viral constituents, they maintained typical Non-CF metabolic profiles. The presence of two alternative metabolic states in CF reflects the heterogenous nature of disease. Though CF is generally considered to be well-characterized, there is still inherent individual variation. The need for alternative therapies for CF is increasing, as microbial antibiotic resistance becomes widespread. The results of this study suggest that CF therapeutics might be better aimed at changing the environment of the airways rather than targeting dominant taxa.",

To aid in mucus dissolution, samples were incubated with 10 ml of 6.5 mM dithiothreitol (Acros Organics: Morris Plains, New Jersey) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The treated sputum was homogenized using a PowerGen 125 mechanical homogenizer (Fisher Scientific: Hampton, New Hampshire) until it was uniform in color and there was no visible particulate debris. Homogenized samples were filtered through a 0.8 micron black polycarbonate filter (GE Water & Process Technologies: Trevose, Pennsylvania) followed by a 0.45 micron MILLEX\u00aeHV filter (Millipore: Carrigtwohill, Colorado) to remove eukaryotic and microbial cells. Viruses in the 0.45 micron filtrate were purified and concentrated using a cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient to remove free DNA and any remaining cellular material [56]. After collection of viral concentrates from the CsCl gradient, the presence of virus-like particles (VLPs) and the absence of microbial contamination were verified by epifluorescence microscopy using SYBR\u00ae Gold (Invitrogen: Eugene, Oregon) as described in [56]. Sputum samples from healthy subjects contained approximately 107 VLPs per ml, while the samples from CF patients contained approximately 109 VLPs per ml. A sample epifluoresence micrograph is shown in Figure S6. Chloroform was added to the viral concentrates to rupture the membranes of any remaining cells. Following a one hour incubation and centrifugation, choloroform was removed by pipetting. To degrade any remaining free DNA prior to viral DNA extraction, samples were treated with 2 units per \u00b5l of Dnase I (Sigma-Aldrich: St. Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Viral DNA was isolated using CTAB/phenol:choloroform extractions and amplified using multiple displacement amplification with Phi29 polymerase [56]. Viral DNA was sequenced at 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT) using the GSFLX pyrosequencing platform to produce ten total viral metagenomic libraries.

XIPE identifies the specific subsystems driving the differences between metagenomes, and in which metagenome the function was are over-represented.",

Principal components analysis (PCA) with the R function prcomp was used to examine overall taxonomic similarities between metagenomes [65]. The first two principal components were used to generate 2D scatter plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NM-MDS) with the R function isoMDS was used to determine relationships between metagenomes based on metabolic profiles. The analysis was performed with NM-MDS instead of PCA for metabolic potential because all metagenomes had at least one hit to each of the 25 subsystems (i.e., there were no zero values). Similar to PCA, NM-MDS does not require a priori classification of the data and plotting the MDS coordinates shows natural grouping patterns. Clusters observed in PCA and NM-MDS scatterplots were confirmed statistically using k-means clustering. To determine the optimal number of clusters, within-group sums of squares were calculated for partitions involving between 1 and 9 clusters [63], [65]. Cluster membership was determined by using the R function kmeans with the optimal number of clusters.",
