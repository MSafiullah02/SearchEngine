If we are to prevent the spread of disease and reduce its far-reaching effects, there must be knowledge of not only the virus itself, but also of the social and psychological sequelae of the disease. Furthermore, if we are to prevent the spread of disease, study of the impact of SARS cannot be limited to those relatively few who have actually contracted SARS; it must also include the general public's reactions to the disease. That is, how has the general public reacted psychologically, socially and behaviorally to news of the disease? To what extent does the general public feel threatened by the possibility of the disease spreading, and how do they cope with these fears? Do their ways of managing their fear of SARS affect their ability to engage in adaptive health behaviors? Understanding ways in which the general public's coping with their SARS-related fears affects their ability to engage in preventative health behaviors is critical. Such knowledge would potentially be applicable, not only in the face of the SARS outbreak, but also in general health promotion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "One of the most significant effects that SARS has had on the general public has been a change in health-related behaviors (Bray, 2003) . These changes were multi-faceted and encompassed everything from frequent hand washing and the use of face masks to complete isolation from the outside world. As evidenced, in part, by the economic fallout of the disease, a common behavior change, particularly in affected areas, was to avoid public venues such as restaurants, marketplaces and airports. Although this sort of behavior is undoubtedly associated with decreasing one's risk of exposure to the virus, it was associated with significant economic costs without a correspondingly large reduction in risk (CDC, 2003a; WHO, 2003a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 134, "text": "(Bray, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 702, "end": 714, "text": "(CDC, 2003a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 715, "end": 726, "text": "WHO, 2003a)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health behaviors"}, {"text": "Another behavioral response to reports of the outbreak was to limit contact with people perceived to be at risk for the virus.

Given that the largest outbreak of SARS occurred in Asian countries, North Americans may have grouped those of Asian ancestry within this last category. Similarly, being Canadian (or Torontonian in particular) was viewed by some as evidence of being high risk by those outside of Canada or North America. Avoiding people perceived to be at risk for SARS was unlikely to be effective from a health-care perspective, and certainly can be viewed as detrimental from a psychological and social perspective.

How these individuals cope with that threat may either facilitate or inhibit their engagement in the aforementioned health behaviors, which, in turn, may directly alter the risk of disease. Examining the role of coping in health behaviors may inform public health efforts to encourage protective health behaviors. Models of stress and coping with disease (Lazarus & DeLongis, 1983; DeLongis & O'Brien, 1990 ) provide a useful framework through which to understand the ways in which threats to health, coping and health behaviors are related. These models emphasize the transactional or interactional nature of the stress and coping process and suggest that when people are exposed to stressors, such as news of the SARS epidemic, an evaluative thought process is triggered in which they consider whether or not the stressor is a threat to their own well-being. This process in turn prompts an evaluation of options for coping with the perceived stressor.

Understanding the ways in which coping is related to engaging in health behaviors may be critical to encouraging effective health behaviors in the face of health crises such as SARS. It was expected that perceived threat of SARS would be associated with higher reported frequency of engaging in a variety of coping strategies in an attempt to deal with feelings of threat and fear. Specifically, these were expected to include wishful thinking, support seeking and empathic responding. Finally, we expected specific coping strategies to be instrumental in facilitating specific health behaviors. That is, given the avoidant nature of wishful thinking as a coping strategy, it seemed reasonable to assume that the use of such a strategy for managing the threat of SARS might be associated with avoidance-type health behaviors. Here, we expected \u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd with the Asian Association of Social Psychology and the Japanese Group Dynamics Association 2004 higher levels of wishful thinking to be associated with higher reports of avoiding both public places and individuals perceived to be at risk for SARS. Finally, empathic responding involves considering the stressful experience not only in terms of one's own feelings and well-being, but also in terms of other's well-being. Given the use of empathy, one might be less likely to consider other people as objects to be avoided but rather as people needing and requiring care. Without the impulse or need to engage in avoidant behaviors, efforts for engaging in health behaviors may be turned towards more preventative and effective health behaviors such as hand washing.

Support seeking may also be related to other outcomes not examined in the present study such as mood or feeling comforted, and it may be that any relation between support seeking and health behaviors is indirect via these more direct effects of social support. Finally, as is observed in the general literature on social support, the effect of support seeking on outcomes may depend upon the response of others (Lehman et al., 1993) . That is, others may not always respond favorably to requests for support. Previous research has indicated that even when support is offered to another, it is not always perceived as helpful. For example, cancer patients report that a sizable proportion of the support that is offered to them fails to provide the comfort or aid that was presumably intended (Dakof & Taylor, 1990) . In the context of health behaviors, support may not always be sufficient to promote effective health behaviors. Consequently, it may be that we need to examine the interactional patterns between the person eliciting support and the recipient of the support requests if we are to understand the ultimate effects of support seeking.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 822, "end": 843, "text": "(Lehman et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1225, "text": "(Dakof & Taylor, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An obvious limitation of the present study is the cross-sectional nature of the data that does not allow the examination of changes over time or processes. The understanding of how individuals cope with SARS would be aided by longitudinal data permitting, for example, examination of the endurance of health behavior changes or how fluctuations in perceptions of threat, perhaps related to media reports, are related to changes in health behaviors. Furthermore, the sample was collected through the Internet using self-report data and thus is subject to the biases and limitations of self-report data and selective sampling due to the use of the Internet. Benefits of the Internet as a collection tool include cost-effectiveness and the enhanced reach of sampling demographics. Additionally, there are recommended strategies to avoid such problems as data falsification and data security issues (Smith & Leigh, 1997) . However, care must be taken to be aware of the medium's limitations as well. The question of validity is an important one. Studies comparing data collected in traditional formats, such as pencil-and-paper (Schwarzer et al., 1999) and telephone survey (Chang, 2002) have found that Internet studies have high validity and yield similar results to data collected in more traditional mediums. In fact in some cases (Chang, 2002; Murray & Fisher, 2002) , Internet surveys have shown higher predictive validity and better psychometric properties than more traditional mediums. However, it is important to note that, as with many mediums, data collected from the Internet cannot be assumed to be representative of the general population. According to the American Internet User Survey, differences include Internet users generally being younger, wealthier and more educated than average survey participants (National Science Foundation, 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 895, "end": 916, "text": "(Smith & Leigh, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1148, "text": "(Schwarzer et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1183, "text": "(Chang, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1344, "text": "(Chang, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1367, "text": "Murray & Fisher, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1855, "text": "(National Science Foundation, 2001)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another notable limitation of the present study is that it examined only a few possible coping strategies using brief measures. There may be other coping strategies important to understanding the psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS, such as problem-focused coping. Additionally, despite examining the role of education, gender and geographic region and failing to find significant differences, our sample is reflective of a well-educated, young, female population mostly residing in Canada, which is unlikely to be representative of populations in other countries. Given the international nature of SARS and its impact, future research should examine a broader sample to see the extent to which the results identified in the present study generalize to other populations. Understanding cultural and geographic differences in coping strategies and health behaviors may facilitate designing more effective health promotion campaigns and media messages focusing on those messages with wider applicability across divergent groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, the present study did not examine the impact of coping on close others. For example, network members may both facilitate and hinder health behaviors as well as impact and be impacted by the coping of another. The current study examined the individual in isolation, which does not capture the interpersonal nature of coping in general or of the SARS threat in particular. While SARS may be transmitted via body fluids person to person, the threat and fear associated with the disease surrounding it travel even faster from person to person. This threat may ultimately be just as damaging to society and individual well-being as the disease itself is to the health of those infected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Given the significant relationships that emerged between coping and health behaviors, the present study highlights the importance of considering coping in managing health threats and in encouraging and discouraging various health behaviors (see also Chang & Sivam, this issue; Gan et al., this issue) . The avoidant behaviors reported in the present study (avoiding public places and people perceived to be at a higher risk for having SARS) and the study by Gan et al. (this issue ) may be associated with significant economic and societal costs to areas affected by SARS. For example, the Ontario Government reported that SARS-related costs, including lost revenue related to decreased tourism and commerce, and assistance for individuals, the health-care system and economic recovery totalled $1.13 billion CAN \u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd with the Asian Association of Social Psychology and the Japanese Group Dynamics Association 2004 (Ontario Government, 2003b) . In communities across Canada, community leaders called for awareness programs to address what they saw as a growing aversion towards the Asian community (e.g. Ontario Government, 2003a; Rider, 2003) . Understanding that wishful thinking in response to the threat of SARS is related to such avoidant behaviors offers the possibility of minimizing the use of this coping strategy and the resultant economic and societal impact this form of coping has had on SARS-affected cities around the globe. Similarly, the results reported here in relation to avoiding people have significant implications for managing public perceptions of disease threats, particularly when individuals being avoided may belong to a particular ethnic group or groups of health-care professionals. The latter may inadvertently serve to reduce the probability of preventative treatment. Having this knowledge can assist public health officials in promoting positive health behaviors while at the same time assisting them in promoting accurate knowledge that will not result in the targeting of particular individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 300, "text": "Chang & Sivam, this issue; Gan et al., this issue)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 458, "end": 480, "text": "Gan et al.

It may be important to encourage the use of empathy in coping with health-threatening diseases such as SARS in our public health messages given that such coping strategies are not associated with higher feelings of threat and are associated with better health behaviors. Given the global impact of SARS on health, perceptions of threat, economic functioning, and societal stability, understanding the psychological impact of SARS is critical in our attempts to manage the disease and the public reaction to it. Knowledge of the psychological reaction to SARS may help us create more effective and productive health messages aimed at limiting the detrimental effects such diseases can have on the well-being of society, even among those many who never contract the disease.

Given the space restrictions, only one wishful thinking item was included. 3. While state anxiety may also be viewed as a dependent variable, the current study sought to examine health behaviors as the outcome variable. Given this goal, state anxiety was controlled for in the analyses to ensure that the relationships observed between coping and health behaviors were not simply due to their shared variance with general state anxiety. Further, in examining the relationship of threat of SARS to health behaviors, we wanted to control for the respondent's general level of anxiety, so that we could examine the specific effects of SARS-related fears on health behaviors. 4. We also ran a series of hierarchical linear regression analyses controlling for the effects of education, gender, affected versus non-affected SARS region, and the interactions between coping and gender, coping and affected/non-affected areas, and coping and time of responding (e.g. before or after mid-July). The pattern of findings regarding the relationship of coping to health behaviors in these analyses was identical to those reported here. 5. A regression model was also run with the two items tapping social support (instrumental and emotional) entered separately. The effects of social support on health behaviors remained nonsignificant in these models, regardless of whether the two items were entered together in the same equation or in separate equations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Anne Marie Vartti (Finnish National Public Health Institute), Arja R Aro (Erasmus Medical Center", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "SARS Collaborative Research Group was assembled by George Bishop with assistance from the American Psychological Society, Division 38 of the American Psychological Association and the Society of Behavioral Medicine.
