It is uncertain whether energy consumption for this hybrid DOAS is larger or smaller compared with the conventional one. So analysis on energy consumption of the hybrid DOAS is one of the main purposes in the present study. Some factors, such as temperature and humidity of outdoor air and regeneration-to-process air ratio, can affect energy consumption and performance of HACS [5], [6], [7].

It is the same in the two DOAS that outdoor air must remove the whole humidity load and part of the sensible load, and the indoor sensible cooling unit handles the other part of the sensible load. But the means of dehumidification is different. In the hybrid DOAS, outdoor air, the process air, is dehumidified when passing through the desiccant wheel. In this process, its temperature increases, which is the result of the dehumidification effect and the heat transfer from the regeneration airstream via the desiccant wheel. As the process air flows through the heat recovery wheel, the heating effect is partially offset by transferring heat from the process air to the cooler incoming regeneration air. The process air is further cooled to the required temperature in the chiller 1, and then enters the room. The whole psychrometric process is shown in Fig. 3(b)\n, and it can be seen that there is truly no limitation on the dew-point temperature in the suggested hybrid DOAS.",

When temperature or humidity of outdoor air rises, chiller1 has to handle more sensible heat load due to the dehumidification, so its energy consumption increases too. As to chiller2, humidity of outdoor air exerts no effect on the indoor sensible load handled by it, as well as its energy consumption. However, higher outdoor air temperature leads to greater indoor sensible load, as inferred from Table 6. So, chiller2 is required to handle more sensible load, with energy consumption increasing. According to Fig. 10(c), energy consumption for DDS goes up greatly as outdoor air humidity rises, while temperature of outdoor air only has slight effect on that, which is determined by the change of regeneration temperature of the DDS. Consequently, based on the energy consumptions of the components, the total energy consumption increases with the increasing temperature or humidity of outdoor air. From Fig. 10(d), the total energy consumption increases 78.2%, when outdoor conditions change from 28 \u00b0C air temperature and 13 g/kg moisture content to 36 \u00b0C and 17 g/kg.",

Based on the calculation and analysis for its energy consumption and COP, following conclusions can be obtained:(1)Compared with the conventional DOAS, energy savings are possible for the suggested hybrid DOAS, when solar energy or natural gas is used for regeneration. As solar energy is used, the energy consumption for the suggested DOAS is lowest. (However, depending on the application, the initial cost of the solar equipment may neglect the saving achieved in the cooling and dehumidification process.) Natural gas is also a better choice for regeneration. But, if electricity is used to heat the regeneration airstream, the suggested DOAS will have the largest energy consumption and poorer COP.(2)More ventilation air flow rate, more energy consumption and lower COP for the suggested DOAS. Therefore, a smaller ventilation air flow rate is appropriate.(3)Temperature and humidity of outdoor air have great effects on energy consumption and COP for the suggested DOAS. The energy consumption increases with the rising of the temperature or humidity of outdoor air, and the COP goes up when the outdoor air temperature rises or the humidity decreases. Considering these effects, in order to keep steady indoor conditions, it is important to adjust the chillers and the DDS, respectively, in response to the change of outdoor conditions. Consequently, an optimal control module for that is required.(4)There is an optimum regeneration to process flow ratio leading to the lowest energy consumption for dehumidification. Accordingly, it is significant to determine this ratio.\n",
