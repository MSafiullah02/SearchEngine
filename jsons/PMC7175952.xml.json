            "text": "Increases in woody plant abundance in response to grazing and associated changes in fire regime have been reported almost universally in savanna ecosystems around the world (Archer 2002; references therein). Woody vegetation increase can reduce grass productivity (Harrington & Johns 1990; Scanlon & Burrows 1990; Dyer et al. 1997) thereby threatening the long\u2010term economic viability of pastoral enterprises. Large\u2010scale changes in the structure or condition of savanna habitats may also compromise wildlife habitat and contribute to the decline of biodiversity (Franklin 1999; Woinarski et al. 2001). Furthermore, changes in woody plant abundance that are anthropogenic in origin acquire economic and political importance in light of national carbon\u2010sequestration budgets arising from international climate\u2010change agreements (Burrows et al. 1998). Despite the obvious importance of the topic there has been little progress toward developing a general theory of savanna woody vegetation dynamics, and there is a remarkably sparse empirical database upon which to build such a theory. Here we examine the landscape\u2010scale response of an Australian tropical savanna subjected to an intensive grazing regime for different lengths of time.",

            "text": "In the Victoria River District (VRD) of the Northern Territory, Australia, there has been widespread speculation and limited inquiry into the extent and nature of woody vegetation increase in savanna environments over the past century. For instance, Lewis (2002), using repeat photography, documented woody vegetation increase that is in some locations very dramatic, most notably on major watercourses and alluvial floodplains. Scientists and pastoral managers consistently report the spread of several tree species (such as \u2018rosewood\u2019, Terminalia volucris R.Br. ex Benth. and \u2018bauhinia\u2019, Lysiphylum cunninghammii (F.M.Bailey) de Wit) onto formerly treeless grasslands on cracking\u2010clay soils in the VRD (Dyer et al. 1997; Crowley & Garnett 1998; A. Andersen, pers. comm. 1999). Such clear evidence of vegetation \u2018thickening\u2019 in the region, while undisputed, is largely anecdotal in nature and thus impossible to assess quantitatively, and the causal mechanisms are unknown. Managers and scientists in the VRD tend to emphasize the role of changing fire management rather than grazing, citing the cessation of traditional Aboriginal burning that followed the establishment of pastoralism in the region (Jacklyn 2000). In practice, fire and grazing are interrelated. For example, Bowman (1997) demonstrated that in the VRD the Australian boab (Adansonia gibbosa (A.Cunn.) Guymer ex Baum) proliferates on heavily grazed lowland habitats where grassy fuels are too diminished to support fire, but declines on sandstone plateaux where intense fires are common. A similar mechanism is apparently responsible for observed woodland thickening in grazed savanna habitats in northern Queensland, Australia (Burrows et al. 1998). Crowley and Garnett (1998) reported that the spread of Melaleuca viridiflora Sol. Ex Gaertn. (\u2018ti\u2010tree\u2019) has effectively transformed extensive grasslands and mixed woodlands on Cape York Peninsula into ti\u2010tree woodlands. The authors attributed these changes to the reduction in fire frequency and/or intensity that accompanied the transition from traditional Aboriginal management to pastoral management (see also Crowley & Garnett 2000), but noted that the actual timing of M. viridiflora recruitment events depended upon favourable climatic conditions even where fire regimes were consistently favourable.",

            "text": "Other research suggests that climate may in some places be the primary driver of vegetation change at a landscape scale. Fensham and Fairfax (2003) assessed changes in woody vegetation cover on a very large scale across the whole of the VRD (120 000 km2) and detected general increases in vegetation cover across a range of habitat types. The scale of their study was too large to consider site\u2010specific management variables, and extended into regions not affected by pastoral operations. The authors suggested that observed increases were a consequence of naturally fluctuating climatic conditions. Similarly, Bowman et al. (2001) documented generally increasing woodiness across a range of habitats in Litchfield National Park (200 km north\u2010east of the VRD), an area with no significant history of pastoralism and minimal recent anthropogenic disturbance. Observed changes were apparently the result of increased rainfall in recent decades, changing fire regime, or both.",

            "text": "Very few studies have systematically examined savanna dynamics across a range of habitat settings with explicit consideration of site\u2010specific management histories. One exception is the study by Bowman et al. (2001) which reported increases in woody vegetation across the full range of a steep topographic gradient, from lowland plains to an adjoining plateau. In contrast, in the VRD where lowland environments are heavily grazed, emerging evidence indicates that vegetation responses to different fire and grazing treatments vary significantly across the major topographic gradient, i.e. from seasonally inundated floodplains of major rivers to the effectively ungrazed and unmanaged sandstone plateaux (Fig. 1). Sharp and Bowman (2004) reported that on sandstone plateaux, changes in total woody vegetation cover are directionally random, spatially patchy, and unrelated to vegetation composition, despite the general decline of fire\u2010sensitive species since the cessation of traditional Aboriginal fire management. Observed change patterns among fire\u2010tolerant dominant tree species are likely a consequence of natural cycles of die\u2010back and re\u2010growth in response to spatially heterogeneous stochastic rainfall events. In contrast, Sharp and Whittaker (2003) demonstrated the widespread and dramatic increase of woody vegetation on alluvial floodplains, apparently a direct consequence of severe overgrazing by cattle and the resulting absence of landscape fire since the 1970s. The focus of the present study is the intervening lowland habitats between plateau and river. Because the management histories of different portions of the study area are variable and known, this setting provides an opportunity to consider the combined effects of different levels of grazing and landscape burning. This paper examines patterns of change in woody vegetation cover across the full range of lowland habitats, not merely where anecdotal evidence suggests that changes have occurred, and assesses these patterns with explicit consideration of site\u2010specific historical management treatments. The paper also explores in greater depth the ecological mechanisms responsible for observed thickening on low\u2010lying \u2018wet\u2019 habitats dominated by Melaleuca and Terminalia spp. Mechanisms responsible for observed changes on \u2018dry\u2019 lowland habitats, supporting tall open Eucalyptus and Corymbia woodlands, are explored elsewhere (Sharp unpubl. data).",

            "text": "Bradshaw Field Training Area, formerly Bradshaw Pastoral Station, is located approximately 350 km south of Darwin near the town of Timber Creek (15\u00b040\u2032S, 130\u00b030\u2032E). The property is bounded by two seasonally flooded tidal rivers, the Victoria River to the south and the Fitzmaurice River to the north, and is dissected by rugged sandstone plateaux and steep escarpment cliffs. The climate of the region is monsoonal. Mean annual rainfall is 938.5 cm y\u20101, 85% of which falls between November and March. Mean daily maximum temperature is 34.8\u00b0C (Bureau of Meteorology 2001). This study is located within the pastoral lowlands of the Angallarri Valley, extending 75 km north and east from Bradshaw Homestead. The study area is bounded to the west by the escarpment cliffs of the Yambarran Plateau and to the east by the braided river channels of the seasonal Angallarri River. The entire study area is relatively flat. Slope was measured at each of 67 vegetation survey sites (below), and varied from 0 to 4%; mean slope was 1.2%. However relatively minor variations in slope have a major impact on vegetation. Many savanna species do not tolerate seasonal inundation, so distinct habitats are effectively defined by water drainage (Fig. 1). Soils and landforms within the study area have been described by Hollingsworth and Aldrick (1997), vegetation by Lane and Orr (1997, 1999), and fire regimes by Yates et al. (2000). Soils are primarily alluvial deposits, ranging from cracking clay or clay\u2010loam soils on low\u2010lying plains to loamy and sandy soils on gently sloping rises nearer the escarpment. Vegetation varies from nearly treeless grassland on cracking\u2010clay plains to tall open woodland on colluvial rises and rocky escarpment foot\u2010slopes.",

            "text": "The Victoria River District has been inhabited by Aboriginal people for 40 000 years or more (Mulvaney & Kamminga 1999). Probably for much of that time the area was actively managed on a landscape scale, most notably by intensive and deliberate seasonal burning in accordance with traditional management practices (see Bowman 1998). The region was colonized by Europeans and converted for pastoral use in the later part of the nineteenth century. Colonization resulted in major disruption of Aboriginal management activities, but Aboriginal people provided most of the labour force for the pastoral industry until the late 1950s, and adapted their traditional fire use to pastoralism. Pastoral managers still burn their pastures in some contexts (Lewis 1991), but unmanaged areas tend to burn both more often and with higher intensity than do areas under active pastoral management (Dyer et al. 1997; Crowley & Garnett 2000; see also Yates et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Due to restricted access and harsh climatic conditions, Bradshaw Station was among the last pastoral properties established in the Victoria River District, in approximately 1900. Early pastoral operations were extensive and effectively uncontrolled. Fences were poor and scattered, and cattle numbers were naturally limited by poor pasture quality and the relative absence of fresh water late in the dry season (Gardener et al. 1990; Winter 1991). Pastoral intensification began in the 1960s with the establishment of effective fencing and artificial watering points. Stocking rates increased dramatically and peaked in the mid\u20101970s. Significantly, though, the northward extension of fenced pastoral operations in the Angallarri Valley was slowed by access difficulties. Several large paddocks were only established in the 1980s, and large areas of suitable lowland habitat were never converted to controlled pastoralism (Sharp unpubl. data). The property was acquired by the Australian Defence Force in 1997 for use as a military training area, and was de\u2010stocked in 1998\u20131999, just prior to the commencement of this study. The existence of edaphically similar habitats that have been grazed intensively for different lengths of time makes the property an ideal location on which to examine the interaction of landscape burning and controlled pastoralism in north Australian savanna environments.",

The threshold was chosen visually by on\u2010screen comparison of the binary image with the original parent image and continual adjustment of the threshold until the boundaries of individual tree canopies matched most closely.

Twenty trees were cut on each selected location. Trees were cut by chainsaw at a height of 30 cm. Tree slices were sanded smooth and the growth rings counted, using magnification where necessary. For each tree, growth rings were counted along three radii away from the centre, and where discrepancies existed the average of the age estimates was used. Where the core of the tree was rotten and growth rings were indistinguishable (common for larger individuals of the genus Melaleuca), the age of the rotten core portion was estimated by examining the intact core of a nearby smaller individual.

Figure 3 demonstrates that grazing strongly determined fire regime (P < 0.0001): prolonged heavy grazing (category 1) effectively reduced grassy fuel loads and eliminated fire from the landscape relative to lightly grazed areas (category 3). Note also that sites in grazing category 2 burned significantly more than sites in category 1, despite the fact that paddocks in both categories were stocked with cattle during the assessed time period (1990\u20131999). Residual effects of grazing on landscape flammability may be cumulative over time due to pasture degradation, erosion or soil scalding (Mott 1987; Winter 1991).

First, the perception of general woody vegetation increase in the region (e.g. Jacklyn 2000) does not apply within the present study area. Net overstorey vegetation cover change since 1948 has been zero or slightly negative. This finding cautions the uncritical acceptance of repeat landscape photography as proof of widespread landscape\u2010scale changes (as in Lewis 2002). Change was neither uniform nor random. Different woody vegetation groups showed clear tendencies for either vegetation increase or decline, a result which suggests that different change mechanisms have occurred in different habitats. In general it appears that low\u2010lying habitats with poor drainage (i.e. \u2018wet\u2019 habitats) have experienced woody vegetation increase, whereas \u2018dry\u2019 habitats have experienced woody vegetation stability or loss, a conclusion that extends also to adjacent floodplains and sandstone plateaux (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp & Bowman 2004). Ecological mechanisms responsible for changes on dry lowland habitats (Groups 3\u20135) are examined fully in Sharp (ubpubl. data). Subsequent analysis in this paper focuses on change mechanisms on wet lowland habitats (Groups 1\u20132).",

The recruitment events responsible for these demographic peaks probably occurred in 1973\u20131975 and 1966\u20131968, respectively. That this demographic pattern was consistent across the full range of grazing treatments (see, e.g. Figs 8a,b) suggests that these recruitment events were a product of climatic conditions that affected the entire study area, and not of site\u2010specific management histories. Nonetheless numerical demographic indices indicated that fire/grazing regime also affected M. minutifolia recruitment. Melaleuca minutifolia stands in grazing category 1 were skewed toward a preponderance of smaller trees, with corresponding decreases in average tree diameter and the proportion of adult trees (Table 4; Fig. 8b,d).

Furthermore, on some locations within these habitats where aerial photographs revealed an increase in woody vegetation cover since 1948, extreme densities of small M. minutifolia trees indicated that the species had been recently invasive (e.g. Fig. 8b).

This suggests that episodic climatic conditions favourable to seedling recruitment were in the past sufficiently powerful to drive net woody vegetation increase within M. minutifolia low woodlands even where grazing was light and burning was frequent. It is likely that germination requires specific climatic conditions but that subsequent survival is affected by grazing and fire regime. This is apparently the case for M. viridiflora, a related species known to have increased dramatically in portions of northern Queensland. Melaleuca viridiflora is thought to require multiple consecutive years with above\u2010average rainfall for seedling establishment to occur (Crowley & Garnett 1998). Melaleuca minutifolia has similar habitat affinities, requiring seasonal inundation for establishment and growth. Nonetheless climate records (Fig. 9) showed that neither identified establishment event (1966\u20131968 and 1973\u20131975) corresponded to periods of uniquely high cumulative rainfall or to any other identifiable climatic trend. Net annual rainfall is unlikely to predict M. minutifolia establishment. Other climatic factors like the length of the wet season may be the primary predictors (Crowley & Garnett 1998). Regional climatic records such as Figure 9 do not capture the temporal and spatial stochasticity of early season storm events, which may exert major effects on seedling establishment.",

We propose that observed M. minutifolia increases are a consequence of the maturation of episodic cohorts that established during favourable hydrological conditions in the 1960s and again in the early to mid\u20101970s. Demographic evidence suggests that conditions favouring M. minutifolia establishment recurred in the 1980s but that subsequent seedling survival and recruitment has been affected by fire regime, which is in turn a direct product of grazing intensity (Fig. 3). Where grazing has been sufficiently intense to reduce or eliminate fire mortality among M. minutifolia seedlings, the stage has been set for further woody vegetation increase within M. minutifolia low woodlands, and also for M. minutifolia proliferation within the understorey of tall open Eucalyptus and Corymbia woodlands. In the latter instance M. minutifolia proliferation may result in the decline of the pre\u2010existing overstorey tree species (Sharp unpubl. data).",

Across the landscape as a whole, multiple change mechanisms are operating, with some habitats experiencing woody vegetation increase while others experience woody vegetation loss, or even both simultaneously (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp & Bowman 2004; Sharp unpubl. data). Suggestions of landscape\u2010scale processes based upon anecdotal evidence derived from particular habitats preferentially (Jacklyn 2000; Lewis 2002) should be interpreted with caution. Even where perceptions of change are accurate it may be impossible to distinguish \u2018anthropogenic\u2019 management effects from \u2018natural\u2019 climate\u2010driven dynamics. This fact will make carbon\u2010storage accounting, for which only anthropogenic changes are politically relevant, exceedingly difficult. In this study we assert that observed M. minutifolia increases are primarily climate\u2010driven, a conclusion consistent with Fensham and Fairfax (2003), but also that the extent and magnitude of this effect is mediated by management regime, as in Crowley and Garnett (1998). Other adjacent and interspersed habitats are experiencing dramatic changes which are evidently management\u2010driven, and which almost certainly affect pastoral productivity (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp unpubl. data). The inherent complexity of observed savanna dynamics presents a considerable challenge to managers charged with ensuring the long\u2010term sustainability of pastoral operations.",

The spread of M. minutifolia may therefore be seen as a positive outcome for conservation management. However, where M. minutifolia has proliferated in the understorey of pre\u2010existing Corymbia woodlands, the demographic distributions of the overstorey stands suggest that M. minutifolia invasion may be destructive of these habitats (Sharp unpubl. data). Similar structural transformations are thought to affect wildlife populations in other savanna environments (Franklin 1999; Woinarski et al. 2001), but in the absence of habitat\u2010specific data, any assertions about the impacts on wildlife of vegetation changes are bound to be purely speculative.",

The site burnt seven times in 10 years; vegetation cover is unchanged since 1948. Combined r\n2 for trees at both locations = 0.925.",
