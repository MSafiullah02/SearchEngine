The main difficulty arises from the fact that annotated datasets are scarce and particularly expensive to collect (require domain expertise), while the ontologies used in this domain are also especially large. From the standpoint of NLP, the relatively small and low-coverage datasets are hard to model using current neural approaches, whereas IR is limited by the subtle semantics underlying the different concepts that constitute the ontologies.",
