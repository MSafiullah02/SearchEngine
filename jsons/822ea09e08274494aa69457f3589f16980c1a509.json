The majority of these are of the upper respiratory tract, but infections of the lower respiratory tract are frequent challenges for clinicians caring for children. Most of these illnesses are mild, and patients suffering from them are appropriately cared for in an ambulatory setting, but a small number are ill enough to require hospitalization and some die. Thus, lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, constitute a major health problem both in the United States and throughout the world. Bacterial pneumonias make up only a small number of lower respiratory tract infections but have the highest mortality rates. The infectious agents responsible for pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection can be divided into bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, and atypical causes. Incidence of specific pathogens differs by age (Table 27 .1). The most common pathogens in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In particular, S. aureus and gram-negative pathogens can affect newborns and malnourished children (5) . Viral illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus have been identified in approximately a quarter of children with pneumonia (5) . The potential complications of pneumonia include parapneumonic (pleural) effusion, empyema, or abscess. Empyema is treated either medically, surgically, or with placement of drainage tubes. Abscesses and necrotizing pneumonias are usually treated medically, but interventional procedures such as drainage tube placement might sometimes be used.",

Nearly one-half of all children with pneumonia will develop parapneumonic effusions, but fewer than 5% of these effusions progress to empyema. However, the incidence of empyema complicating community-acquired pneumonia is increasing, which causes significant childhood morbidity (6) . Progression of a pleural effusion to empyema is through a three-stage evolution: (1) exudative, (2) fibrinopurulent, and (3) organization. Most commonly pleural effusions do not progress beyond the exudative phase and resolve with antibiotics alone (4, 7) . The second stage is heralded by the arrival of bacteria, by pleural invasion from the contiguous pneumonic process. Progression occurs with polymorph accumulation and fibrin deposition; membrane formation occurs and the developing empyema may become compartmentalized or loculated. The chemistry profile of pleural fluid is characterized by a decrease in pH and glucose concentrations and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDH). The most common organisms encountered in pleural fluid in children are S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . If a fibropurulent pleural effusion is not adequately treated, then the third organizing phase develops. Fibroblasts grow into the exudate from the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces. An inelastic membrane is formed, which and may encase the lung and pleura, with the potential to restrict respiration. The thick exudate may drain spontaneously through the chest wall or into the lungs, causing a bronchopleural fistula. Other infectious complications of empyema include bacteremia and pericarditis by direct extension or bacteremic seeding, and pneumothorax.",

History focuses on assessment of age, presence of fever, chest pain, dyspnea, immunizations, duration of symptoms, exposure to sick contacts, and recent travel. In a study of 110 children with respiratory infections, tachypnea emerged as the best clinical sign for identifying pneumonia, with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 67% (19) . Although there may be findings suggestive of either viral or bacterial pneumonia, the clinical exam does not reliably diagnose pneumonia nor distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonias.

Chest radiographs were independently reviewed by two radiologists, and they found that 74% of the patients with alveolar and 62% with interstitial pneumonias had bacterial infection. An interstitial pattern of pneumonia on chest radiographs is therefore nonspecific: it could be due to viral (26%), bacterial (30%), or mixed (44%) etiologies. Hence, distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonias in pediatric patients remains problematic, given the number of clinical and radiographic findings that overlap.",

Chest radiograph accuracy rates were reported as follows: fluid loculations (42%), abscess formation (40%), bronchopleural fistulae (33%), and parenchymal involvement (84%). A limitation of this study is the lack of reported sensitivity and specificity values. Donelly and Klosterman performed a study of 56 patients with complicated pneumonia who were not responding to treatment. Chest CT was compared to a chest radiograph performed earlier on the same day. CT scans were evaluated for the presence of cavitary necrosis, abscess, bronchopleural fistula, cavitation, loculated pleural effusions, malpositioned chest tube, pericardial effusion, or bronchial obstruction (50) . All 56 CT scans demonstrated at least one of the above findings that were not seen on chest radiographs (50) . A total of 110 findings were seen on CT and not on chest radiography, with an average of approximately two findings per CT scan. Parenchymal complications totaled 40 and pleural complications 37. In another retrospective analysis of 17 children who underwent both CT scanning and chest radiography, evidence of cavity necrosis is often seen on CT before or in the absence of findings on chest radiographiy (52) .",

CT has been shown to have higher accuracy than plain radiography for early detection of pneumonia in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients (45, 48) . For example, in a series of 48 patients (median age of 11 years and range of 2-19 years), chest radiographs and CT were rated independently by three experienced radiologists and subsequently correlated with biopsy or bronchoscopic washing results. CT was shown to identify more true-positive cases of bacterial and fungal pneumonias than radiography (91 versus 85%). Unfortunately, no detailed numbers of sensitivity and specificity were cited (45) . In 87 adult patients with febrile neutropenia (median age 47, range 18-80 years), CT detected pneumonia 5 days on average earlier than chest radiographs and was more sensitive in the detection of poorly defined opacities, ill-defined nodules, consolidation, groundglass opacities, pleural effusions, cavitations, and bullae (53) . For the evaluation of children who are severely ill or immunocompromised for fungal infections and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), CT can add value. Janzen et al., in a retrospective review of 45 children who underwent both CT and chest radiography, found that the first-choice diagnosis was correct in 44% on chest CT and correct in 30% on chest radiography (p < 0.05) (49) . Equivocal or normal chest radiographs are common, reported up to 39% in patients with PCP infection and up to 10% of patients with known pulmonary disease (17) . CT can aid in the detection of fungal infections via identification of nodules, cavitation, ground-glass opacities, and halo effect (45) (46) (47) . CT can play an important role such as in evaluating pulmonary aspergillosis and candidal pneumonias (45) . In another study to evaluate if CT adds information to chest radiography, 33 cases were reviewed retrospectively (54) . It was found that in 16 cases CT added no additional useful information, but in 17 cases CT added confidence and changed management (biopsy, changing antibiotics, bronchoscopy).",

There are several studies evaluating the prognostic implications of the use of ultrasound versus CT and the implications for treatment decisions. Ultrasound can be helpful in both prognosis and treatment decisions. It is a low-cost test, widely available, portable, does not use ionizing radiation, and rarely requires sedation. This has to be contrasted to CT, which has a relatively high radiation dose, in the order of 100 times that of a chest radiograph. Ultrasound is effective in demonstrating \"high-grade\" effusions containing septations, fronds, loculations, and debris. US depiction of the thickness and number of these septations predicts the success of chest tube drainage (55) . CT assists in providing a global assessment for pre-therapy planning, including the ability to demonstrate size, possible loculations, and the extent of lung involvement, including abscess formation or necrosis (51) . Kearney et al. demonstrated in a retrospective review of 50 patients who underwent both US and CT that, although both US and CT have effective roles, neither technique reliably identified the stage of pleural effusions or predicted whether patients would require surgical intervention (56) . Donnelly et al. have shown in a retrospective review of 30 patients who received a chest CT with subsequent pleural fluid analysis that CT characteristics of a parapneumonic effusion do not allow one to predict empyema and distinguish it from a transudative process (57, 58) . Experienced radiologist reviewers rated the presence of pleural enhancement (seen in 100% of empyemas and in 89% of transudative effusions), pleural thickening (57 and 56%, respectively), abnormal extrapleural space (66 and 67%, respectively), and extracostal chest wall edema (33 and 56%, respectively) (57) .",

Operative therapy included video thoracotomy, open decortication, or pleural debridement, and non-operative therapy included antibiotics alone with or without thoracentesis or chest tube placement. When the ultrasound detected high-grade effusions (evidence of organization such as fronds, septations, or loculations), the hospitalization stay was shorter (8.6 days) for patients eventually treated operatively, compared to those who were not (16.4 days). In non-operated patients in whom ultrasound revealed low-grade effusions, there was no significant difference in hospital stay length between patients treated with antibiotics alone and chest tube drainage (55) . In another study, ultrasound has also been shown to be quite effective in identifying empyemas (59) . In this prospective study of 1640 febrile patients admitted to the ICU, 94 patients underwent 118 ultrasound-guided thoracenteses for pleural effusions, identified by chest radiography and ultrasound. In 11/31 studies where a complex septated pattern and in all four where a diffusely hyperechoic pattern was reported, empyemas were confirmed with thoracentesis. On the other hand, in none of the remaining 83 studies where an anechoic or complex non-septated/hypoechoic pattern was reported were empyemas diagnosed.",

However, in children, thoracentesis is not easily performed as this procedure requires cooperation and frequently sedation. Patients treated with thoracentesis have been reported to require additional interventions due to recurrence (4, 6, 60). For example, Tu et al. found in 94 ICU patients with a pleural effusion suspected to have empyema that additional interventions were often needed; a total of 118 image-guided thoracentesis procedures were performed in this group (59) . A prospective study of 67 patients with empyemas found that single chest tube placement versus repeated thoracentesis had no significant difference in outcome, thereby supporting that in children early thoracotomy tube drainage is preferred to thoracentesis, in order to avoid repeat interventions (61) . In this study, the patients were prospectively divided into two treatment arms: chest tube placement (32 patients) and ultrasound-guided thoracentesis (35 patients).

In children, fibrinolytic therapy has been reported in three studies with about 64 cases (63). There were no in-hospital deaths. The aggregate data revealed a failure rate of 9.3% and a complication rate of 12.5%. One of the studies was a 10-center randomized prospective study of urokinase undertaken by the British Paediatric Respiratory Society Empyema Study Group (64) . They reported a slight reduction in length of stay in hospital compared to the saline group (7.4 versus 9.5 days).

These surgical papers may be biased toward operative in favor of image-guided intervention. However, even a meta-analysis, performed to evaluate primary operative versus non-operative therapy in children with empyema, suggested a more favorable response with early surgical intervention (VATS or thoracotomy) (63) . In this meta-analysis, primary operative therapy was associated with lower in hospital mortality rate, re-intervention rate, length of stay, time with tube thoracotomy, and time of medical therapy when compared to medical management.
