            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan China in 2019. The disease in notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. The molecular mechanism as to why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Understanding these differences is critical for safeguarding the vulnerable and guiding effective policy and treatments. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the endocytic entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol showed markedly increased apparent diameter (~10% to 100 nm) and almost twice the total number of viral entry points. The cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the viral entry site where SARS-CoV-2 docks to properly exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, we show cholesterol enhances binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface which increases association with the endocytic pathway. Decreasing cellular cholesterol has the opposite effect. Based on these findings and known loading of cholesterol into peripheral tissue during aging and inflammation, we build a cholesterol dependent model for COVID19 lethality in elderly and the chronically ill. As cholesterol increases with age and inflammation (e.g. smoking and diabetes), the cell surface is coated with viral entry points and optimally assembled viral entry proteins. Importantly our model suggests high levels of cholesterol is most alarming in the tissue, not the blood. In fact, rapidly dropping cholesterol in the blood may indicate severe loading of cholesterol in peripheral tissue and a dangerous situation for escalated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) oppose the effects of cholesterol and provide a molecular basis for eating healthy diets to avoid severe cases of COVID19.",

The lethality of the virus is notably selective for elderly 1,2 and those with chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and smoking [3] [4] [5] . Interestingly, almost all children are either asymptomatic or present with very minor symptoms, while elderly and those with underlying conditions experience very severe life-threatening symptoms. This disparity was also observed with SARS-CoV-1, a closely related virus which failed to kill any children under the age of 12, despite being much more lethal than SARS-CoV-2 in adults 6 . Understanding why young people are resistant in this class of viruses could help both healthy and chronically ill adults avoid severe symptoms of COVID19.",

SARS-CoV-1 requires cholesterol and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid domains (also called GM-1 lipid rafts) for infectivity of cultured cells 11 . Cholesterol is needed to form GM1 lipid rafts, which are the entry point for the viruses via endocytosis [11] [12] [13] [14] . GM1 lipid rafts partition away from polyunsaturated lipids or disordered lipids 15 (see Supplemental Figure S1A ). i., Cholesterol (yellow shading) is shown loaded into lipoprotein (e.g., low-and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL respectively)) from blood serum. ii., Cholesterol free human apolipoprotein E (apoE, brown shading) a cholesterol transport protein is exposed to mixed with blood serum and iii. transports cholesterol in and out of cells (grey shading) (see also Supplemental Figure S1B ). (B) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (CoV-2-PV) entry assay. Cells were treated with a luciferase expressing retrovirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that recapitulates viral entry. Infectivity was monitored by a luciferase activity in cells treated with or without apoE. High cholesterol (apoE + serum) was more than 3-fold higher compared to low cholesterol.

Remarkably, these same diseases are highly comorbid with COVID19 3,5 . Based on these finding with cholesterol, we have proposed a model for age dependent infection of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2G ). When cholesterol is low there are very few entry points and their diameter is small (similar to children). With age, average cholesterol levels in the tissue increase, thereby increasing the number and size of viral entry points (similar to adults).

The virus surface is covered with spike protein and the binding of ACE2 may create enough affinity to pull GM1 lipids to envelope the virus and drive entry into an endosome.",

Palmitoylation is a post translation modification that attaches a 16 carbon saturated lipid to many proteins and traffics them to GM1 lipid rafts 41 . Palmitoylation of the cysteinerich endodomain of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein is important for spike-mediated cell fusion and viral entry 42, 43 . Little is known about palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2. We aligned SARS-CoV-1-2 and found that all 9 putative palmitoylation sites in SARS-CoV-1 are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4D ). A single significant mutation (alanine to cysteine) introduces an additional putative palmitoylation site in SARS-CoV-2, which suggest SARS-CoV-2 remains under evolutionary pressure for palmitate driven viral entry.",

One, the size and number of entry sites are cholesterol dependent ( Figure 2D-F) . If there are few of the preferred entry points, the virus cannot enter the cell as efficiently( Figure 1B-C,) . Two, the cholesteroldependent ability of the receptor, and presumably the virus, to dock into the more advantageous lipids is logically one of the most important steps to infectivity ( Figure 1B ). If the virus isn't positioned in the membrane correctly it likely cannot enter the cell efficiently. Third the proteases that activate SARS-CoV-2 for membrane insertion are also cholesterol dependent and rely on a membrane protein translocation mechanism for activation ( Figure 4 ) (i.e., lateral diffusion into lipid rafts in the membrane).",

When cholesterol was depleted SARS-CoV-2 infectivity went down ( Figure 1B-C) . Further supporting this conclusion, the increased binding of the RBD domain in higher cholesterol suggests the virus has evolved to prefer the endocytic pathway. Over expression of TMPRSS2 does increase infectivity 8 . If TMPRSS2 is the preferred mechanism for children, they may not be as effective in elderly and chronically ill. However, our studies do not rule out that TMPRSS2 contributes to the endocytic pathway in pneumocytes or in higher cholesterol. Without a cholesterol source, most cell cultures likely represent the conditions seen in children, not the elderly and chronically ill. This may be important for development of treatments for COVID19. Importantly, our model suggests high levels of cholesterol in the tissue are indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, not the levels of cholesterol in the blood. Most clinical diagnosis of cholesterol are done by analyzing blood samples, however these level do not necessary indicate the level of cholesterol in the tissue. This difference is particularly true of chronic inflammation where blood cholesterol is low due to inhibition of cholesterol efflux proteins in the peripheral tissue 19 (see also supplementary material). Our model is consistent with a clinical study in China that showed LDL and HDL cholesterol were low in severe COVID19 patients, yet monocytes in the blood had high cholesterol 44 . The high cholesterol in monocytes is consistent with cholesterol loading into peripheral tissue during chronic inflammation.",

This would increase the amount of virion cut at the S1/S2 position, especially in high cholesterol tissue.

Pair correlation and cluster analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis package in the Vutara SRX software. Pair Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to determine the strength of correlation between two objects by counting the number of points of probe 2 within a certain donutradius of each point of probe 1. This allows for localization to be determined without overlapping pixels as done in traditional diffraction-limited microscopy. Raft size estimation and raft density were calculated through cluster analysis by measuring the length and density of the clusters comprising of more than 10 particles with a maximum particle distance of 0.1 \u00b5m.

For the Student's t test, significance was calculated using a two-tailed unpaired parametric test with significance defined as p < 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. For the multiple comparison test, significance was calculated using an ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. Figure S1 . Cholesterol transport and function in GM1 lipid rafts (A) The side view of a plasma membrane is shown (top extracellular). The membrane partitions into regions of ordered (saturated) and disordered (unsaturated) lipids. The ordered region is containing cholesterol and sphingolipids (Sph). The packing of cholesterol with the saturated lipids is thought to provide the order and makes ordered lipids thicker than disordered lipids. The disordered region contains unsaturated lipids including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 and PA are signaling lipids and PIP2 forms its own lipid domains separate from GM1 lipid rafts. Palmitoylation of proteins typically occurs on the cytosolic portion of the membrane and inserts into the inner leaflet (red line with lipids attached). For a virus that exits the cell the palmitoylation may insert into the extracellular leaflet. (B) Cholesterol loading into lung pneumocyte's and macrophages. In healthy individuals most cholesterol is produced in the liver. The effluxes cholesterol through ATB binding cassette (ABC) transporters (not shown) loaded into apolipoproteins (e.g., A and E; apoA and apoE). The cholesterol is then transported through the blood serum in the form of high-and low-density lipoproteins to the lung. In the lung receptors take up the cholesterol. In healthy individuals, excess cholesterol is effluxed from ABCA1 transporter in the lung loaded into apoA1 or apoE and transported back to the liver for elimination. During chronic inflammation reverse cholesterol transport is inhibited and cholesterol is loaded into macrophage rich tissues in the periphery. Figure S2 . SARS-CoV-2 (Mut) pseudovirus (PV) entry assay. Cells were treated with a luciferase expressing retrovirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (mutant) that recapitulates viral entry. Infectivity was monitored by a luciferase activity in cells treated with or without apoE. High cholesterol (apoE + serum) was more than 3-fold higher compared to low cholesterol. Figure S3 . ACE2 surface expression and GM1 lipid raft density. Quantitation of ACE2 cluster (A) and signal (B) shows that the expression of ACE2 remains roughly constant when cells are loaded or unloaded with cholesterol by the cholesterol transport protein apoE. Although, while not statistically significant ACE2 expression appears to slightly decrease in high cholesterol (ApoE + serum) which agrees with the clinical findings of decreased ACE2 surface expression in older people. (C) Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbCD) robustly decreases the apparent size of GM1 lipid rafts.",

ACE2 receptor (cyan) labeled with ACE2 antibody has very little overlap with GM1 lipid rafts when blood serum is removed (middle panel). Scale bar, 1 \u00b5m. (B) Cholesterol dependent trafficking of ACE2 in and out of lipid rafts. ApoE-mediated cholesterol influx translocates ACE2 from disordered regions into lipid rafts while cholesterol depletion by M\u03b2CD diminishes ACE2's raft localization. (C) Model showing cholesterol-dependent raft localization of ACE2 enhances SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. (D) Raft size analysis suggests raft assembly is regulated by apoE mediated cholesterol transportation between serum and cell membrane. (E) ApoE transportation of cholesterol regulates raft density. Cholesterol influx from serum results in an increase in raft density. (F) Ripley's K-Function (H(r)) showing raft separation after cholesterol depletion while distance between rafts gets shorter as apoE transport cholesterol from serum into the membrane. (G) Proposed model for infectivity in SARS-CoV-2 by age and chronic disease.When cholesterol is low there are very few entry points and their diameter is small (similar to children). With age, average cholesterol levels in the tissue increase, thereby increasing the number and size of viral entry points (similar to adults). In chronically ill patients, tissue cholesterol levels are the highest and all the ACE2 receptor is positioned for viral infectivity via the more potent endocytic mechanism (adults + chronic inflammation).",

ACE2 and furin are clearly associated with GM lipid rafts while TMPRSS2 sits in the disordered regions (<2 pair correlation with GM1 clusters).
