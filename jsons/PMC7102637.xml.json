However, its effectiveness will be influenced by the initial experience and preparedness of the health-care system.6 Although there are observational data on the use of rescue ECMO during previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, mainly in the context of influenza A(H1N1) ARDS, the real need for ECMO during such outbreaks is unclear. For reference, the incidence of ECMO use in patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) ARDS in Australia and New Zealand was estimated to be 2\u00b76 cases per million, whereas 5\u00b78% of the critically ill patients in Saudi Arabia were supported with ECMO for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related ARDS.7, 8 Therefore, the overall impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on potential ECMO use is currently unclear, but there could be an increased need for ECMO worldwide.",

During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, inadequate surge capacity highlighted the need for intensive-care reserves and improved health-care resource planning at all levels.17, 18 In an effort to improve ECMO preparedness19 for an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, we highlight the ten key components of an ECMO action plan (panel\n) based on these four categories, with practical recommendations for health centres to ensure appropriate training, capacity, and planning, depending on local priorities and resources. The focus is on building sustainable systems that ensure quality care for patients and their families and staff safety and wellbeing.

As supply chains might be compromised by excessive demand, the components essential to operating an ECMO service should be centrally coordinated.

All ECMO centres should identify key rate-limiting factors to target in the event of a surge in demand with respect to the four key categories of resource allocation (figure 2). It is probable that when all resources are stretched during an outbreak, the use of ECMO might be reconsidered and available resources targeted at caring for more patients with interventions that are less resource-intensive.6 Expert centres might consider offering ECMO services to less experienced centres by sending in a satellite team or using telemedicine24 until resources are re-established in the expert centre. A regional plan for monitoring available beds and supplies could assist in coordinating the distribution of transported patients to avoid overloading a referral site. For decisions involving resource allocation and complex inter-hospital transfers, a local and regional ECMO coordinator could help to strengthen this model of care.",

Operators should be familiar with the ECMO cannula sizes and dilators and be able to deal with cannulation complications while wearing PPE or PAPR.

This strategy can include a neuromuscular blockade and should always include prone positioning unless contraindicated or technically unfeasible.

Equally, in unstable patients and in patients who are likely to deteriorate during transfer, ECMO can be used to facilitate safe transport from a non-expert centre to an expert centre.34 All infection control and personal protection measures should be followed when ECMO is being initiated for a patient in extremis, as such uncontrolled situations can put team members at high risk of exposure to pathogens.",

Collection and sharing of data are important to ensure preparedness and patient care, especially in parts of the world that have not yet been affected by the outbreak. The ELSO registry that currently collects de-identified patient data on indication, demography, and haemodynamic and biochemical variables before and after initiating ECMO, as well as details of patient outcomes and complications from more than 400 ECMO centres worldwide, can be a useful resource during an outbreak of an infectious disease, and modifications to existing data collection (eg, information specific to COVID-19 such as swabbing details or cycle threshold values for PCR) might provide valuable data for quality assurance and research. Research during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases can be further facilitated by global research collaborations, such as the International ECMO Network, International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), and the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (ECMOCARD) collaborative.

These preparations for the COVID-19 outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO in sufficiently resourced settings. Careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables, such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process, risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role of antiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors, might affect outcomes with ECMO.
