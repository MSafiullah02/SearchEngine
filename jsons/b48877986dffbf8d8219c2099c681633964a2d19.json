            "text": "Intrapartum care of women with COVID-19: A practical approach Dear Editor, Obstetricians have steadily fought to improve outcomes for women over the past 3 decades, with the application of evidencebased medicine. The current COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed this standardized approach with a deluge of information, at times contradictory, leading to confusion in the labor ward regarding best practice. As community person-to-person transmission of the virus escalates, we will increasingly have to manage labor for COVID-19 positive patients. In this context, we have developed a comprehensive but concise information bulletin ( Fig. 1) , to allow all caregivers ease of access to the most up to date information. This is based on recommendations issued by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology [1] , Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [2] , Coll\u00e8ge National des Gyn\u00e9cologues et Obst\u00e9triciens Fran\u00e7ais [3] , and Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology [4] .",
