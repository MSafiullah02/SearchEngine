These systems enable public health officials to manage the spread of disease by some prevention and control activities such as travel restrictions, movement bans on animals, vaccination, etc. In many cities in the United States and some other countries geographical early outbreak detection systems have been established. Also in livestock industries the importance and usage of such systems is on the rise [2].",

            "text": "Statistical tests in disease surveillance systems attempt to determine whether the disease incidence in a spatial and/or temporal defined subset in comparison with the disease incidence in the whole study region is unusual. Thus, this class of methods is designed to detect clusters of disease in space and/or time [7]. Scan statistics originally developed by Naus [3] is used for temporal clustering to test whether the number of disease cases in a temporal subset, exceed the expectation given a null hypothesis of no outbreak. Kulldorff [8] developed a spatial scan statistics to test geographical clusters and identify their approximate location. In this method, many circular windows with different centers and radii are checked to detect clusters, where the number of disease cases inside the cluster is maximized, while the number of disease cases outside the cluster is minimized. The spatial scan statistics is not suitable to detect spatio-temporal clusters. This method does not consider the time component and it cannot detect recently emerging clusters. To address this problem, Kulldorff [9] extended the spatial scan statistics to spatio-temporal scan statistics, which can be used to detect recent emerging (viz. alive) clusters. In this method, cylindrical search areas are used where, the spatial search area is quantified by a radius of the cylinder, and the temporal search area is defined by its height. Moreover Kulldorff et al. [10] proposed an elliptic version of the spatial scan statistics by using an elliptic scanning window of variable location, shape (eccentricity), angle, and size. This method is more efficient to find non-circular (narrow) shaped clusters. The idea has been implemented as a software package SaTScan [11], which is widely used as an efficient outbreak detection system.",

In this study, we propose a more flexible geometric structure that can be used as an efficient scanner window to find irregular shaped clusters in spatial and spatio-temporal domains. More specifically, we build upon a generalization of a circular shape, which is divided into a certain number of sectors where each sector comes with its own radius. To take advantage of the significant flexibility introduced in this manner, the scanner windows need to be optimized. Given the nature of the optimization problem arising in this way, we consider the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) being regarded as a flexible population-based optimization tool [12].",

            "text": "It is instructive to take a quick look at the methods used in forming clusters of irregular geometry, especially those exploiting mechanisms of Evolutionary Computing. Duczmal and Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, [13] used simulated annealing to find spatial clusters with irregular shapes. In this method, the regions of the studied map are considered as the nodes of a graph so that the adjacent regions are connected in the graph. Then the problem is converted to finding a connected sub-graph with maximum likelihood ratio. The idea of graph representation of the map, has gained a lot of attention among other researchers. Along with well-recognized advantages, the proposed method comes with some shortcoming. First, it usually finds peculiar (very irregular) shapes. Second, finding a medium to large size sub-graph with maximum likelihood ratio is a computational intensive task. To address this problem, Duczmal et al. [14] proposed a genetic algorithm that uses a fast offspring generation and an efficient evolution to generate different connected sub-graphs. The authors used a penalty function to avoid finding peculiar clusters. Tango and Takahashi [15] used graph representation as well and proposed a new method to construct connected sub-graphs. They used a (k\u22121)-nearest neighbor approach to select adjacent nodes in graphs, which controls the irregularity of clusters in shapes. In [16], Patil and Taillie used the notion of \u201cupper level set\u201d to reduce the size of scanning windows and proposed an \u201cupper level set scan statistics\u201d. The authors did not discuss how to select the level and no comparison with the circular scan statistics is reported.",

In circular spatio-temporal scan statistics instead of a circular window located in two dimensions, a cylindrical window formed in three dimensions is used, where the spatial search area is defined by cylinder radius, and the temporal search area is defined by cylinder height. Since we are going to find \u201calive\u201d clusters (prospective analysis), candidate cylinders are limited to those that start at any time during the study period and end at the current time period. In elliptic spatio-temporal scan statistics, like the cylindrical the spatial search area is defined by ellipses and the temporal search area is defined by its height.",

In each iteration/generation, the search for optimal position (solution) is performed by updating the particles\u2019 velocities and positions based on a predefined fitness function. The velocity of each particle is updated using two best positions, namely personal best position and neighborhood best position. The personal best position, pbest, is the best position the particle has visited and neighborhood best position, nbest, is the best position the particle and its neighbors have visited. Based on the size of the neighborhoods, two PSO algorithms can be developed. When all of the population size of the swarm is considered as the neighbor of a particle, nbest is called global best (gbest) and if the smaller neighborhoods are defined for each particle, nbest is called local best (lbest). Gbest uses the star neighborhood topology and lbest usually uses ring neighborhood topology. In this topology, each particle in the population is connected to its two immediate neighbors on the basis of particle indices as shown in Fig. 1\n [28]. There are mainly two reasons why neighborhoods based on particle indices are preferred: It is computationally inexpensive, and helps the spread of information regarding good solutions to all particles [28].",

In the third method which is used in the circular and elliptic scan statistics by default [11], a region will be considered inside the scanner, if its centroid is inside the scanner. Fig. 4\nshows the selected regions in the map based on the three mentioned methods when number of sectors is one (circular scanner). For implementing the first and second methods, one way is defining set of coordinates in different parts of each region to check whether a region (its defined coordinates) is inside a cluster or not. The advantage of these methods is that we can make sure that the selected regions by the scanner are connected. In other words the selected regions are set of neighbors in the map. The limitation of this method is that the flexibility of selecting various regions will be decreased. Also checking a lot of coordinates for each region to see whether a region is inside a cluster or not, is a time consuming process.",

On the other hand, because of the shape restrictions in circular and elliptic scanners, the areas with low disease rates cannot be removed from the cluster.
