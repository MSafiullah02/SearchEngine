However, during World War II, the US government sponsored clinical trials that demonstrated the therapeutic value of chloroquine (CQ) as an antimalarial and its superiority over existing drugs, thereby heralding its widespread use in the treatment and prevention of different forms of malaria [2,3]. The antimalarial activity of CQ is thought to occur in the parasite digestive vacuole (DV) where degradation of the host erythrocyte hemoglobin leads to release of the toxic waste product, iron (II) protoporphyrin IX (FeIIPPIX), which undergoes auto oxidation to the equally toxic iron (III) protoporphyrin IX (FeIIIPPIX) or hematin [4]. The parasite, however, can adapt by detoxifying hematin to a dimerized nontoxic hemozoin form. CQ interferes with this dimerization and detoxification of hematin, thereby impeding hemozoin formation [5], leading to inhibition of parasite growth. The exact killing mechanism is not well understood albeit the peroxidation of parasite lipid membranes, damage of DNA and oxidation of proteins are implicated in parasite death [6].",

However, in 1961, the first case of a CQ-resistant (CQR) Plasmodium falciparum strain was reported in Colombia [7] with more cases increasingly reported over subsequent years from various malaria endemic regions [8]. Consequently, by early 2000, CQ had been largely replaced by mefloquine (2) (MEF), sulfadoxine (3)-pyrimethamine (4) (SP) and later artemisinin (5)- or artesunate (ART) (6)-based combination therapies (ACTs) as the treatment of choice for falciparum malaria.",

            "text": "Although widely known for its tremendous success against malaria before the advent of resistance, CQ has also been successfully repurposed for the clinical management of other noninfectious conditions. For example, by the early 1960s, results of clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of CQ in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were already being reported [11]. Based on the findings of such trials, CQ and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (7), are both still in clinical use as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) [12]. Its usefulness in the management of other auto-immune conditions such as lupus erythematosus (LE) was similarly recognized as early as the 1950s based on observations using related antimalarials such as quinine (8) (QN) and quinacrine (9) (QNR) (Figure 2) [13]. Since then, numerous clinical evidence have confirmed the beneficial role of CQ and HCQ in treating LE even during pregnancy [14]. More recently, CQ and its analogs have been the subject of intense interest in the development of safe and effective cancer drugs. It has been implicated in modifying cell differentiation as well as in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy in different cancer cell lines [15]. Indeed, CQ has been shown to potentiate the anticancer effects of drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, highlighting its potential utility as a combination agent in cancer chemotherapy [16].",

Among these, isoquine (12) displayed superior in vitro activity to AQ against both the CQ-sensitive (CQS) HB3 (IC50: 9 nM vs 18 nM) and the CQR K1 (IC50: 6 nM vs 25 nM) P. falciparum strains. This in vitro potency was also translated into in vivo activity in the rodent malaria model P. yoelii on oral administration in the standard 4-day test resulting in a mean half-maximal effective dose (ED50) of 2.7 mg/kg for compound 12 compared to 7.7 mg/kg for AQ. The potency of this compound has also been confirmed against clinical isolates from a malaria-endemic region with a median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 9 nM compared to 56 nM for CQ [18]. The increase in potency and decrease in dose would be expected to reduce the potential toxicity of the compounds claimed in this invention.",

In 2013, Portland State University patented CQ-derivatives referred to as \u2018reversed chloroquines\u2019 (RCQs), which are hybrid molecules covalently linking a CQ-like (inhibitory) moiety and a resistance reversal moiety [19]. Examples of the RCQs are shown in Figure 5 (13\u201318). The resistance reversal moiety is thought to sensitize CQR parasites to the inhibitory moiety by reducing the efflux of the CQ moiety from the parasite\u2019s DV. This covalent linking is believed to enhance the local concentration of either or both drugs to effectively inhibit growth of CQR or CQS parasite strains. The feasibility of this approach has since been confirmed by other studies, some of which have generated even more potent modifications of the prototype molecule [20,21].",

To pre-emulsify the mixture, 3% w/w sodium dodecyl sulfate in purified water was added with rapid stirring. The resulting homogenous solution of micelles was then treated with potassium persulfate (1% w/w), a water-soluble radical initiator, to induce free radical polymerization. The resulting emulsion contained uniformly sized polyacrylate nanoparticles in which the drug is covalently incorporated directly into the polymeric matrix of the nanoparticle. Experimental IC50 values proved the drug in the nanoparticles retained antiplasmodial activity and that the nanoparticle itself was nontoxic to the parasites.",

Introduction of a branched dialkylamino motif at the terminal N of CQ side chain has been reported to yield metabolically more stable antimalarials with retained activity against drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum\n[28].

The antiplasmodial activity of compound 46 against the FCR3 strain was superior (EC50 = 6.6 nM) to that of CQ, QN, MEF and artemisinin. These compounds also had lower cytotoxicity (evaluated against mouse mammary tumor FM3A cells) than the standard antimalarials used as controls and subsequently, compound 46 exhibited the highest selectivity while compound 47 had a selectivity index comparable to CQ [29].",

The in vitro IC50 values for 48 against CQS (D6) and multidrug-resistant (Dd2, Tm90.C2B and 7G8) P. falciparum strains were 6.2, 11.6, 12.0 and 11.3 nM compared to CQ\u2019s 11.2, 160, 144 and 55 nM respectively. A Thompson Test using P. yoelii in mice on 48 yielded an ED50 of 2.5 mg/kg/day, which was comparable to the efficacy of CQ (2.4 mg/kg/day). An in vivo efficacy test of 48 using P. berghei infected mice at a dose of 64 mg/kg/day for 4 days yielded a 100% cure rate with the mice remaining aparasitemic for the full 30-day examination period [30,31].",

Protease inhibitors (PIs) on the other hand possibly impair plasmodial growth by targeting plasmepsins (aspartyl enzymes structurally similar to HIV proteases) \u2013 a hypothesis fortified by the fact that maximal sequence homology between the two proteins exists in their catalytic site which, in the HIV protease, is noncovalently bound to and inhibited by PIs. Another potential ground for the antimalarial effect of PIs is the down-modulation of P. falciparum cluster of differentiation 36 receptor on human erythrocytes [45].

This would be consistent with targeting TSG101, as interfering/inhibiting the interaction of viral particles and this protein could interfere with the movement of the virus to the cell surface and subsequent budding.

Interestingly, the activities of AQ dihydrochloride (IC50 = 2.6 \u00b5M) and QNR hydrochloride (IC50 = 1.8 \u00b5M), the other CQ-containing test compounds, were still superior to those of two recognized pigmentation inhibitors, phenylthiourea (IC50 = 29 \u00b5M) and hydroquinone (IC50 = 36 \u00b5M) [60]. In a more recent patent by New York University, the activity of CQ in combination with the hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor, nitisinone, in treating tyrosine-positive albinism was further claimed [61]. In this invention, high-throughput screening of over 2000 approved drugs identified CQ as an agent that reverses diminished pigmentation in mouse melanocytes, which lack expression of the Oca-2 protein (Oca-2-null).

            "text": "The potential use of CQ in other therapeutic areas (repurposing) and the use of its 7-chloroquinoline nucleus as a template for synthetic 4-aminochloroquinolines (repositioning) continues to generate new drug discovery opportunities. Within the context of repurposing of CQ, most studies appear to be based largely on the use of racemic CQ with no studies focusing on the effect of the respective (R) and (S) enantiomers. While in malaria the two enantiomers and the racemate are equipotent, presumably due to an achiral heme target, the same may not hold for other diseases where the mechanism of action of CQ may not involve an achiral target. Thus independent evaluation of the (R) and (S) forms of CQ may reveal additional benefits. Furthermore, in order to maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinoline class of drugs, studies undertaken should also be extended to other clinically used related acridine and 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials that share the same mechanism of action with CQ. These include the acridine pyronaridine and 4-aminoquinoline piperaquine, which represent the two most advanced 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline drugs in the clinic. On the other hand, analog-based design based on modification of the lateral side chain of CQ has been a successful endeavor in delivering 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline agents that address drug resistance and/or toxicity in malaria. The most advanced of these are FQ and AQ-13, which share closer structural similarities to CQ. Of these, only FQ has reached Phase II human trials. AQ-13, a simple truncated CQ analog has been shown to overcome the CQ clinical resistance due to P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter [95].",

Cardiovascular or CNS effects, reactive metabolite formation and low clinical therapeutic ratio are the typical safety issues associated with 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline compounds. Although thousands of 4-amino-7-chloroquinolines have been synthesized, there has been limited structural diversity as the overwhelming majority, including compounds covered in this review, share the 7-chloroquinoline core scaffold and differ mainly in the 4-amino substituent. The 7-chloroquinoline core scaffold seems to be a major contributor to the aforementioned safety issues. As such any new 4-amino-7-chloroquinolines are unlikely to have significant differences in their properties and safety profiles albeit it may yet be possible to design a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline with diminished risk for cardiotoxicity.",

Regarding pharmacophore modeling, it is noteworthy that the crude pharmacophore for 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials is known [96]. In this model compounds have a bi- or tri-cyclic lipophilic electron-deficient aryl ring systems for \u2013 pi-pi stacking of the nuclei with heme and also have terminal pendant basic groups to both increase accumulation in the DV as well as to interact with heme propionates. This crude pharmacophore is augmented by structure activity-relationship studies on CQ [97].",
