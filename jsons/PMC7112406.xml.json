            "text": "Collecting child maltreatment data is a complicated undertaking for many reasons (World Health Organization, 2016). Although governmental and other official data records are the gold standard for the data of many disciplines, official data records for child maltreatment have several significant issues. First, the definition of child maltreatment differs substantially depending on the geographic region, agency or organization, and purpose for data collection. For example, Section 3 of the United States Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) defines child abuse and neglect as, \u201cat a minimum, any recent act or set of acts or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act, which presents an imminent risk of serious harm\u201d(Children\u2019s Bureau, 2010). States and other jurisdictions are free to develop their own definition, so long as it meets or exceeds the federal definition (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2016). These differing definitions result in inconsistent reporting to The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), the official government data source in the United States for child abuse and neglect reports (Children\u2019s Bureau, 2016). The NCANDS is also subject to changes in the jurisdictional definitions over time (Children\u2019s Bureau, 2016). Thus, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about trends over time or across geographical areas from official data reports. It is particularly difficult to create estimates that are sensitive enough to assess the impacts of broader social trends or interventions on child maltreatment.",

Estimates suggest that between fifty and eighty percent of child maltreatment victims are not officially reported so even without concerns about bias in the data, official reports underestimate the prevalence of child maltreatment and may not represent the true experience of children who are maltreated (Fallon et al., 2010). As a result of the introduction of these biases, the use of these data for research or evaluation is complicated.",

            "text": "Surveys of parents or children avoid some of the pitfalls associated with official data but introduce other issues. Approaches that require participant disclosure, whether retrospective or prospective, are subject to both random and systematic bias (Kahneman et al., 2000). Human memory is a function of various heuristic strategies so participant reports are influenced not only by characteristics of the event in question but also the experiences before, during, and after the event (Kahneman et al., 2000; Smallwood & O\u2019Connor, 2011). In addition to these general issues with self-reported data, studies of child maltreatment may face additional limitations due to the sensitive nature of the questions. Individuals may intentionally withhold information related to child maltreatment due to social desirability, embarrassment, or concerns about confidentially and the repercussions of reporting abuse (Everson et al., 2008). Concerns about repercussions may be especially prominent when talking to parents about their children\u2019s experiences because many institutional review boards and universities require researchers to report suspected child maltreatment to child protective services. Researchers may also directly ask minors about their experiences. This approach reduces the issues associated with retrospective report but is debated because children may not have the necessary perspective to recognize their experiences as abusive or to critically process the potential costs and benefits of disclosure (International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse & Neglect, 2016). In addition, infants and very young children, who are unable to report experiences to researchers, have the highest rates of maltreatment so child-reported research is not possible with the subpopulation at the highest risk of maltreatment (U.S. Department of Health, and, & Human Services, 2017).",

Historically, survey samples drawn via random digit dialing could provide reliable measures of population health indicators (Lee et al., 2011). As cell phones have increased in popularity, more people are unreachable through a landline number. In addition, cell phone service has not been equally adopted across the population so random digit dialing is likely to miss young people, people with low socio-economic status, and males (Lee et al., 2011). In addition to these potential biases, increased telemarketing, screening calls through caller ID, and call blocking present additional challenges to an adequate, representative response (Lee et al., 2011). Because of these changes, it is difficult to adequately access a sample that is representative of the population.",

The National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS), which is conducted in the United States, works with child welfare agencies to identify children served during the three-month study period, then solicits reports from other professionals who regularly engage with children (Sedlak et al., 2010). Using complex methodology, duplicate reports are removed so the final database includes abused children who were and were not known to child welfare to provide a more comprehensive view of the prevalence of child maltreatment (Sedlak et al., 2010). The NIS funding does not allow for frequent data collection and it has only been conducted four times since 1974 (Fallon et al., 2010). Cost is a significant limitation to this data collection approach and without substantial funding increases, timeliness of the data and inability to regularly monitor trends across time are significant limitations (Fallon et al., 2010). In addition, this method relies upon professionals\u2019 knowledge of child maltreatment so it is likely that many maltreated children are not detected.",

Each potential data source has relative strengths and weaknesses, but, relying on any single source of information provides an incomplete and potentially biased view of the issue of child maltreatment (Afifi et al., 2015). Researchers in other areas of health, such as infectious disease, have readily adopted social media and internet-based approaches to triangulation. These approaches may be particularly relevant to child maltreatment researchers as 98% of young people in the United States access the internet at least weekly and 93% use at least one social network site (Lenhart, 2015). However, there have been notable lapses in accuracy for some of these approaches, which highlight the importance of rigorous evaluation and validation of these new approaches, prior to adoption and throughout the process of utilization (Olson, Konty, Paladini, Viboud, & Simonsen, 2013). To that end, the field is beginning to explore how techniques that rely on the use of social media may or may not be applicable to child maltreatment epidemiology and research.",

The first framework was broadly focused on how social media and other forms of internet-based technology were used for health surveillance, which also included some broader epidemiologic research. The second framework focused on the use of social media for child maltreatment research. For each framework, one author reviewed the title and, if available, the abstract of all articles found through the search framework. Articles were considered possibly relevant if social media or internet-based approaches to health research or surveillance were discussed in the abstract. Articles with possibly relevant content were downloaded and the full text of the article was reviewed. For this review, social media was conceptualized using the Bright, Margetts, Hale, and Yasseri (2014) definition as \u201ca means of communication, based around a website or internet service, where the content being communicated is produced by the people using the service.\u201d",

            "text": "Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining services, ideas, or content from a large, undefined group of volunteers or part-time workers through a flexible open call. The volunteers and part-time workers have varying degrees of experience, knowledge, and skills. Most often, researchers use crowdsourcing to complete large, monotonous tasks or recruit large numbers of survey participants. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Google Consumer Surveys, and proprietary systems or websites are the most common methods of crowdsourcing. Amazon Mechanical Turk is an online multi-use crowdsourcing platform hosted through Amazon where users are recruited to answer surveys or complete repetitious tasks for a small amount of money. Google Consumer Surveys is another crowdsourcing platform used to recruit a large number of participants for short surveys (<10 questions) (Sell, Goldberg, & Conron, 2015). Samples may be constructed to be nationally-representative based on age, gender, and geographic distribution of respondents. However, participants tend to be younger and more technologically savvy than the general population. Participants who complete surveys receive micropayments ($1 or less) in the form of Google Play Store credit. Crowdsourcing tends to be cost-effective, facilitate easy recruitment, and allow for access to a geographically diverse sample. However, there may be bias in the results of studies using Amazon Mechanical Turk and Google Consumer Surveys related to varying access to the internet within a population so older adults, individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and others may be underrepresented (Bethlehem, 2010).",

            "text": "Internet search query analysis, specifically Google Search Trends, is one of the most common forms of online public health surveillance. Google Search Trends, a regularly updated database of aggregated search queries, provides the relative search volume of terms selected by the researcher. The relative search volume scale normalizes queries to a scale of 1\u2013100 where 100 is the highest search proportion and 1 the lowest search proportion. In one of the earliest studies of internet search trends, Yahoo! and Google searches for cancer related terms in the US were significantly associated with estimated incidence and mortality rate of cancer (Cooper, Mallon, Leadbetter, Pollack, & Peipins, 2005). This study and another also found significant associations between cancer-related internet search and the volume of related news coverage, which may suggest at least some of the correlation is due to media coverage prompting online searches (Cooper et al., 2005; Fazeli Dehkordy, Carlos, Hall, & Dalton, 2014). For example, searches for multiple sclerosis in Italy are highest in the geographical areas with the highest rates of multiple sclerosis but may also be attributed to increased media reports in the region (Brigo, Tezzon, Lochner, & Nardone, 2014). A review from 2013 found internet search query surveillance often had comparable findings to traditional surveillance methods (Bernardo et al., 2013). However, false positive and false negative results were a common problem in many of the reviewed studies. The review authors concluded internet search query data should be used to support, rather than replace, traditional surveillance methods.",

As a passive data collection method, researchers may download existing information from Twitter. Alternatively, researchers may use Twitter as a platform for reaching participants. Regardless of the collection method, there are several ways Twitter data may be used for research and surveillance. The content of individual tweets may be examined to determine how people are discussing topics and changes in trending hashtags may be examined to determine how discussions around topics change over time. Social network analysis, examination of the relationships between users, may also be conducted to determine how information moves through networks. These analytic methods can be implemented by automated algorithms (Cao et al., 2015; Denecke et al., 2013; Odlum & Yoon, 2015; Paul & Dredze, 2014; Prieto, Matos, Alvarez, Cacheda, & Oliveira, 2014; Yom-Tov, Borsa, Cox, & McKendry, 2014) or by human analysts.",

Since these changes to language vary across users, it may be difficult for researchers to accurately categorize or recognize health information. However, Twitter recently doubled the character limit in many languages so issues with syntax and spelling may also change (Castillo, 2017). Twitter data may also be difficult to work with because they are unstructured and created at a very rapid rate. To address some of these issues, MappyHealth was created to simplify data management and analysis (Boicey, 2013). At the time of writing, it appears MappyHealth has been discontinued as the website and Twitter account are no longer active.",

One evaluation found that models predicting influenza rates from internet-based surveillance were most accurate when they accounted for newspaper and television reports (de Lange et al., 2013). Another evaluation found the number of social media messages was more strongly correlated with the number of online news articles than the number of reported measles cases, which supports social media as a measure of public opinion, rather than disease detection (Mollema et al., 2015). The limitations associated with social media and internet-based approaches were also demonstrated during the Ebola outbreak in the US. Social media posts and internet searches increased due to the public panic surrounding the outbreak, rather than due to a high incidence of the disease (Towers et al., 2015).",

Child maltreatment-related internet media reports have also been examined, but there were clear biases in reporting that suggest the use of media for surveillance would be problematic. Two innovative studies about child maltreatment using social media addressed very narrow questions about the risk behaviors of a subset of children who have been maltreated and about detecting risk for child maltreatment by examining the social media of caregivers of seriously ill children. At the time of writing, there was very little peer-reviewed published work related to social media and other internet-based approaches in the study of child maltreatment.",

            "text": "This review had several limitations. First, the review excluded articles that were not published in English so important work conducted in other languages would not be included in this review. This limitation is common among reviews conducted by researchers from majority native English-speaking countries; yet, future reviews may benefit from including other languages. Second, it was possible to define social media, internet-based technology, and surveillance in various ways. Differing definitions may have resulted in a different literature base to review. Finally, the search framework resulted in the inclusion of a variety of research designs, health outcomes, and technology approaches. This variety prevented quantitative comparisons across studies. However, as previously noted, that type of analysis is outside the scoping review framework, which focused on the extent, range, and nature of research with respect to a focused topic, as well as the identification of gaps in the literature. As also noted, scoping reviews are ideal for topics with emerging evidence, such as social media.",
