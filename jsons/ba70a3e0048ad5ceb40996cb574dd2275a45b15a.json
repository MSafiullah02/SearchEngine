They were classified into veryearly (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A riskadjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. Results: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0-510] vs. 1500[650-2300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100 vs. 2600[1600-3800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17-0.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h. Conclusion: A very early start of vasopressor support seems to be safe, might limit the amount of fluids to resuscitate septic shock, and could lead to better clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Early detection and prompt reversion of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion are key elements in the treatment of patients with septic shock [1, 2] . Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion [2] . Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis [3, 4] and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock [5] [6] [7] highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated [1] . Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a \"1-h bundle\" [8] including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP \u2265 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations [8] is quite limited and remains debatable.",

In line with this, recent experimental data suggested that fluid resuscitation preceding the start of vasopressors is associated with higher lactate levels and a paradoxical increase in vasopressor requirements when compared with an immediate start of vasopressor therapy without previous fluid administration [11] . Likewise, a number of observational studies suggest that the volume of resuscitation fluids and net fluid balance is associated with mortality in sepsis [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

First, norepinephrine may increase cardiac output by increasing stressed volume [26] , by improving myocardial contractility [27] , and through other various mechanisms [28] . Second, norepinephrine might increase microcirculatory perfusion in septic shock [29] [30] [31] , especially when the baseline microcirculatory blood flow is abnormal [32] . Third, early use of norepinephrine may improve the regional distribution of blood flow and prevent fluid overload [25] . Finally, delays in correcting hypotension are associated with increased risk of death in septic patients [33] [34] [35] , whereby prompt correction of hypotension might influence clinical outcomes. Indeed, a recent phase II randomized controlled trial suggested that early use of norepinephrine might improve the possibility to achieve more sustained mean arterial pressure levels and adequate tissue perfusion parameters [36] . However, this trial was limited by a specificity of the protocol requesting administration of a fixed dose of vasopressors in the early group, which is not the usual way of administering vasopressors.",

The ethical and research committee involving human beings approved the use of the data (Protocol number 1238, IRB/EC approval number 099-2018, Fundaci\u00f3n Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia). The presence of infection was determined according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention criteria [39] . For analysis purposes, however, septic shock was re-classified according to the current Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis 3.0), which consider the presence of suspected infection accompanying organ dysfunction, the use of vasopressors, MAP < 65 mmHg, and lactate levels > 2 mmol/L [40] . Meanwhile, patients with sepsis and vasopressor requirement but without hyperlactatemia were reclassified and analyzed as sepsis-related acute circulatory failure. Surviving patients requiring less than 6 h of vasopressor support were not included in the initial main analysis, as they could not be representative of septic shock. Nevertheless, these patients were also evaluated in an ulterior sensitivity analysis. Patients < 18 years old, pregnant women, patients with liver failure (prothrombin time > 15 s or international normalized ratio \u2265 1.5 and any hepatic encephalopathy), advanced liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C), and those with do-not-resuscitate orders were excluded.",

In each case, the start of vasopressor (VPs) was identified and used as a reference point to determine the time elapsed from the first hypotension episode (FHypo) and from the FRLoad. The decision to start vasopressor support was always taken by the attending physician according to his clinical judgment. The delay time until the start of antibiotics was also recorded with respect to the first hypotension episode. In addition, time intervals from FHypo, FRLoad, and VPs up to ICU admission were also recorded. The volume of resuscitation fluids received before VPs was also registered. Then, the volume of resuscitation fluids and dose of vasopressors were recorded at 2-h intervals from the VPs up to 8 h, and then, 12, 18, and 24 h after VPs.

Fluid resuscitation was performed administering repeated fluid challenges with crystalloids and/ or albumin 4%, using the central venous pressure (CVP) as a dynamic safety limit during fluid loads in patients with a central line in place. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) were not used. The usual protocol in our institution includes the use of pulse pressure and stroke volume variations to guide fluid resuscitation (when usable). Additionally, echocardiographic determination of velocity-time integral (VTI) before and after passive leg raising (PLR), and end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were used whenever applicable. The clinical assessment of peripheral perfusion (e.g., measuring capillary refill time [42] and/or the evaluation of mottling score [43] ) and the use of advanced monitoring of cardiac output were allowed at the discretion of the attending physician. Norepinephrine was the first-choice vasopressor used to achieve MAP \u2265 65, while vasopressin titrated up to 0.04 UI/min was also allowed to increase MAP or to decrease norepinephrine dose, but never as a single vasopressor. Dobutamine up to 20 \u03bccg/kg min was used in case of myocardial dysfunction, when ScvO 2 or lactate goals were not achieved or when clinical signs of hypoperfusion persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Mechanical ventilation was used when indicated, providing light sedation (midazolam or propofol) and analgesia (fentanyl). Red blood cell transfusion was used to maintain hemoglobin levels at or above 7.0 g/dl or > 10.0 g/dl in case of cardiac ischemia. Low-dose hydrocortisone was used when the vasopressor requirement did not decrease during the first 6 h of resuscitation in the presence of an adequate intravascular volume.

In fact, information about the \"pre-vasopressor\" period in septic shock is quite limited because most of the current evidence on early goal-directed resuscitation comes from randomized controlled trials in which patients received a pre-determined amount of fluids as a prerequisite to be included (5-7). We retrospectively studied this \"pre-vasopressor\" phase in patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h, followed by a sensitivity analysis including a minority using VP support for less than 6 h. Those in which VP was started < 1 h from the first fluid load (VE-VPs) received significantly less amount of resuscitation fluids at both pre-vasopressor and early resuscitation period, the net fluid accumulation at 8 and 24 h was significantly lower and they also had a significant lower mortality.",

Such effect of VE-VPs on the lower net fluid accumulation in our study was apparently mediated by the limiting fluid administration more than by increased fluid elimination. Although the lower mortality of patients in which norepinephrine was precociously initiated might have several potential explanations, a more rapid restoration of blood flow in combination with lower fluid accumulation could early restitute tissue perfusion and avoid the harm mediated by fluid overload. Interestingly, VE-VPs patients had the same blood pressure at time of first fluid bolus as patients with D-VPs, suggesting that the differences between groups were related to the timing of vasopressor initiation more than to the severity of hypotension. All patients included in our study followed a quantitative resuscitation protocol in which fluid responsiveness was repeatedly tested during the initial resuscitation period aiming to achieve some tissue perfusion goals. Remarkably, although receiving lower amount of resuscitation fluids for achieving the same resuscitation goals, patients in the VE-VPs group had a significantly lower mortality, which is in line with studies showing that norepinephrine may reduce preload dependency [45] due to recruitment of preload reserve from the unstressed blood volume, thus leading to lower fluid requirement. Unfortunately, although biologically plausible, the observational nature of our study does not allow confirming whether a more precocious mobilization from nonstressed to stressed blood volume by early introduction of vasopressors might have influenced the requirement of resuscitation fluids.",

Nevertheless, very low and non-titrated doses of norepinephrine were used while the idea of administering a fixed dose of fluids before to start of the \"non-blinded\" vasopressor support was maintained. Importantly, the rate of achievement of lactate clearance after 6 h of resuscitation was extremely low and did not differ from those not receiving the study low dose of vasopressor. In contrast with this, our patients received a MAP-targeted dose of norepinephrine along with other resuscitation maneuvers directed to restore tissue perfusion. Furthermore, early introduction of VPs in our study Early use of vasopressors could change the course of hemodynamics in septic shock. A recent experimental model of endotoxemia suggested that fluid resuscitation might paradoxically increase vasopressor requirements compared with an early and isolated use of VP [11] . In the same line, our data suggests that lower doses of norepinephrine could be required when VP support is introduced very early, at least during the first 6 h of resuscitation (see Additional file 1: Figure S4 ). Therefore, the early onset of VP would seem to prevent the progression of circulatory dysfunction.",

Meanwhile, some experimental studies have suggested potential benefits of early combination of vasopressors and fluids on splanchnic blood flow [25] . Due to the nature of our study, it is not possible to discard the concurrence of hypovolemia. Nevertheless, fluid resuscitation in both VE-VPs and D-VPs groups was guided by using fluid responsiveness test and clinical parameters, targeting the restoration of systemic and peripheral perfusion variables. In our study, the intervention consisting of very early use of vasopressors was not associated with an excess of acute kidney injury or increased requirements of acute renal replacement therapies. In addition, most patients initially received vasopressor support through peripheral veins for a few minutes up to a central venous line was obtained, which was not associated with major complications. Finally, although severe digital ischemia cases were not observed, other side effects such as myocardial ischemia were not systematically searched.",

On the contrary, it evaluated the effects of the rapid introduction of vasopressors, correcting promptly hypotension, therefore limiting the amount of fluids administered while otherwise achieving similar hemodynamic goals. Indeed, fluids were administered based on the same criteria of fluid responsiveness in all patients. In addition, this study is not a probe for the \"1-h bundle\" recently proposed [8] but rather a hypothesis generator about the benefits of early start of vasopressors in septic shock, emphasizing that patients of the VE-VPs group received the immediate start of norepinephrine without completing a predefined volume or resuscitation fluids.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, important limitations should be mentioned. First, the nature of this study and, therefore, the lack of control by randomization and blinding might limit the validity of conclusions. Admittedly, although propensity scores were constructed incorporating baseline characteristics likely influencing the decision for an early start of VP support, other nonidentifiable potential factors might not have been included. In addition, the small sample size introduces a risk of missing important differences at baseline that might contribute to the observed differences in mortality instead of early vasopressor introduction. Second, also due to the nature of our study, it is not possible to establish causal mechanisms leading to differences in clinical outcomes between the groups. Nevertheless, we speculate that the combination of shortening of hypotension time, lower pre-vasopressor and post-vasopressor fluid requirements, and, consequently, lower net fluid accumulation could have influenced clinical outcomes. Third, acute renal failure, acute renal replacement therapies, and digital ischemia were easily tracked. However, other adverse consequences of the early use of vasopressors cannot be ruled out. Fourth, we are not able to identify if the decision of the early start of vasopressors relied on some particular doctors, which could constitute a potential factor of confusion. Finally, although the single-center design might restrict a potential generalization of our results, exclusions were very limited so that this trial reflects the overall spectrum of patients with septic shock. Furthermore, the biological plausibility of these results, the potential physiological mechanisms of early introduction of VPs, and the agreement with recent experimental observations deserve future research efforts.",
