Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years;P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.",

            "text": "The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease infections that developed in Wuhan, Hubei Province has spread to other provinces in China. As of 16 February 2020, 51,857 patients with COVID-2019 have been reported and 1,121 deaths were confirmed in China (Ding et al., 2020) . To date, accumulated evidence has indicated personto-person transmission both in hospital and family settings (Chan et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Since January 23, 2020, the source city was locked down to suppress the spread of the disease; however, the massive human movement during the traditional Chinese New Year holidays might have fueled the spread of the disease. At present, there were at least 10,000 cases in other provinces, mostly identified through symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China. Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) . Unlike SARS-CoV, transmission of COVID-19 occurs during the prodromal period when those infected are mildly ill, and carry on usual activities, which contributes to the spread of infection (Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Zou et al., 2020) . According to the report on \"Diamond Princess\", among the 1,723 tested travelers, 189 asymptomatic individuals were positive for the COVID-19 virus as of 17 February 2020 (Wikipedia, 2020) , which indicated that a large number of asymptomatic carriers and mild patients remain undiscovered in the community. It is crucial to identify and isolate asymptomatic carriers and mild patients in order to contain the outbreaks in later stages.",

In the family of Case 13, Relative 1 (wife of Case 13) first visited the hospital ( Figure 2 ). Relative 1, a 64-yearold otherwise healthy woman, developed fever (the highest temperature was 38.7\u00b0C), cough, fatigue and vomiting on Jan 30, 2020. Three days later (Feb 2, 2020), she visited the hospital and was tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Then, epidemiological investigations and nucleic acid tests were conducted on her son (Relative 2), daughter-in-law (Relative 3) and Case 13. Relative 2 and 3 had developed respiratory symptoms before investigation and were demonstrated positive for the COVID-19 virus. Nucleic acid test was also positive for Case 13, but he had no symptoms during admission. Through epidemiological investigation, Case 13 admitted his travel history to the city of Huanggang, Hubei province on Jan 19-20, 2020. Relative 1, 2 and 3 are all local Nanjing residents and denied the history of contact with any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient, except for Case 13, in the recent 14 days. During hospitalization, Case 13 had no symptoms but remained positive for the COVID-19 virus till Feb 18, 2020, which indicated that the communicable period could be as long as 29 days (from Jan 21 to Feb 18, 2020). Among the 3 infected family members, Relative 1 developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU on Feb 6, 2020. Relative 2 and 3 cleared the virus on Feb 18, 2020. In brief, Case 13, an asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers transmitted the virus to his cohabiting family members, and 1 of the infected individuals developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was admitted to ICU.",

            "text": "In the present study, we provided epidemiological and clinical data of 24 asymptomatic COVID-19 infections identified from the screening of close contacts in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. These asymptomatic cases were mildly ill as compared to those previously reported in Wuhan, Hubei (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . None of the 24 cases developed severe pneumonia as of Feb18, 2020, and only 5 cases showed typical symptoms during hospitalization. Similar to previous studies (Chang et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) , fever, cough and fatigue were the main symptoms. Lymphopenia and leukopenia, previously associated with disease severity (Chen et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) , were uncommon in the asymptomatic cases of the present study. Interestingly, we found that young cases (<15 years old) were prone to be asymptomatic even during hospitalization and to have a normal CT image, which partially suggested that nucleic acid testing would be crucial to identify asymptomatic infections in young close contacts. Notably, we provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that led to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings indicate that asymptomatic carriers can result in person-to-person transmission and should be considered a source of COVID-19 infection. It is also implicated by the report of the \"Diamond Princess\" that large numbers of asymptomatic or mild patients might have been hiding in the community. Therefore, it is of great public health significance to strictly monitor close contacts via multiple nucleic acid screenings to contain potential outbreaks. Of particular, since massive movement returning to the work place and the school is in progress, active contact tracing and strict health monitoring should remain an important strategy in China, or worldwide. Guidance of self-protection, active isolation of close contacts (either at home or centralized) should be continuously highlighted. Isolation and multiple virus nucleic acid detections are also recommended for discharged COVID-19 patients.",

The included cases were identified from systematic screening of the close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) both in clinic and in community. All asymptomatic carriers were admitted to and treated in the Second Hospital of Nanjing, and therefore the study population has strong representativeness of the whole city. We collected the contact history and followed longitudinal nucleic acid tests of the close contacts during their hospitalization, which provided a relatively reliable communicable period of asymptomatic cases. However, it is notable that the real communicable period was longer than calculated, due to the censored data of 6 patients and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection. Secondly, our study was conducted in Nanjing, and the results might not be generalizable to other areas in China. Thirdly, there is still a possibility of missing carriers when screening from close contacts using the pharyngeal swab specimens. At last, this study is limited by the small sample size and lack of data on nucleic acid tests before the diagnosis date. Large-scale multicenter studies are needed to verify our findings.",
