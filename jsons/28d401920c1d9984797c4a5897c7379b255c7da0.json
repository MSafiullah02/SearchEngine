Infectious bronchitis is caused by a coronavirus, the IB virus (IBV), which primarily induces respiratory disease. Nevertheless, the virus is able to replicate in nonepithelial respiratory tissues, where it can cause disease (Dhinakar Raj and Jones, 1997; Cavanagh, 2003 Cavanagh, , 2007 . The clinical signs of respiratory infection include coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. However, the economic importance of IB is that infection decreases the weight gain of infected broilers as well as the egg quality and production of infected laying hens (Cavanagh and Naqui, 2003; Alvarado et al., 2006) . In addition, IB can lead to secondary infections by Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Matthijs et al., 2003) . Infections by different IBV strains have been reported worldwide, mainly in regions with heavy poultry industry activity, such as the United States and Europe (Zanella et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "The IBV genome codes for 4 structural proteins: N (nucleocapsid), M (membrane), E (envelope), and S (glycoprotein). The serologic or genotypic classification of IBV is based on characteristics of its glycoprotein S. As suggested by De Wit (2000) , there are diverse methods to classify viral strains, including reverse-transcription (RT) PCR. ABSTRACT Infectious bronchitis is caused by a coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Infectious bronchitis is an acute and highly contagious disease of economic importance due to the reduction in weight gain observed with infected broilers and the drop in egg quality and production associated with infected laying hens. The presence of deep pectoral myopathy has been associated with IBV variants. This lesion is detected at slaughterhouses and is characterized by paleness and atrophy of the deep pectoral muscle, including necrosis of the region, leading to condemnations of the breast muscle, a valuable meat cut in the market. This work aimed to study the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV by describing tracheal and muscle lesions and comparing the frequency of IBV detection via reverse-transcription (RT) PCR in muscle, tracheal, and cecal tonsil samples from broilers with and without myopathy. A case-control study was conducted in 40 broiler flocks vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain. The case group consisted of 23 flocks that presented myopathic lesions under sanitary inspection and a con-trol group of 17 flocks without myopathic lesions. The tracheal, cecal tonsil, and supracoracoid muscle (with and without lesions) samples from the 40 broiler flocks were screened by RT-PCR to detect IBV. Histopathology of muscle and tracheal tissue was carried out. Upon microscopic examination, the muscle samples from the case group presented extensive necrosis, intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, muscle fiber fragmentation, and fibrotic tissue, confirming myopathy, whereas muscles from the control group showed no alterations. The tracheal samples presented a large number of infiltrated mononuclear inflammatory cells that in some areas formed submucosal nodules. A total of 25 flocks tested IBV positive by RT-PCR: 14 from the case group and 11 from the control group. The IBV was detected by RT-PCR directly in muscle samples. Despite that, the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV was not established. The higher positive IBV RT-PCR percentage noted in the cecal tonsil samples demonstrates how important the choice of organs is for diagnostic purposes.",

In addition, a review by De Wit (2000) cited the kidneys and cecal tonsils as superior choices when sampling chronic infections. Furthermore, De Wit (2000) reported that detection success is affected by several factors, including the time between the beginning of infection and sampling, quality and choice of organs, and chicken immunity levels. Such factors might better justify the cecal tonsil and muscle detection results. The higher detection rates observed for IBV when performing RT-PCR of the cecal tonsil samples demonstrate the importance of organ selection when conducting diagnostic tests. ",
