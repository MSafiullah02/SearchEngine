HPAIviruses cause spillover infections in humans that may be severe or fatal. Examples include outbreaks of H5N1 and H7N9 HPAI viruses in Asia with high case fatality among humans, although limited human-to-human transmission [22, 23] has been reported. HPAI virus adaptations might lead to sustained human-to-human transmission, and so poultry outbreaks are managed by flock depopulation [24]. Influenza A subtypes isolated in swine include H1 to H5, H9, and N1 and N2. Subtypes that spillover into humans cause mild to severe illness and are known as swine \u201cvariant\u201d viruses [25].",

Antigenic drift of H and N surface glycoproteins drives annual epidemics. From 2017 to 2018, seasonal influenza caused approximately 49 million illnesses, 1 million hospitalizations, and 79,000 deaths in the United States alone [27]. When two or more influenza A viruses infect a common host, such as a bird or pig, individual gene segments may recombine to form a novel virus, known as antigenic shift. Influenza pandemics occur when novel viruses emerge into an immunologically na\u00efve population and become adapted for sustained human-to-human spread. The 1918 \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza pandemic was the most severe on record, resulting in anestimated 50 million deaths [28]. Less severe pandemics occurred in 1957, 1968, and 2009. In an effort to improve preparedness and response to seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza, the World HealthOrganization (WHO) conducts global surveillance of influenza A and B isolates (Fig. 5.2a) [29].\n",

Historically, measles infected an estimated 90% of children by age 5 years, resulting in approximately 2 million global deaths each year [10]. With the introduction of the measles vaccine in1963 and advances in global vaccination programs, measles cases and mortality have drastically declined (Fig. 5.2b). By 2017, 85% of children worldwide had received at least one dose of the measles vaccine by age 1 year, and during 2000\u20132017, global measles mortality decreased by 80%, preventing an estimated 21 million deaths [31]. Of the 24 known measles genotypes, only five were detected in circulation during2016\u20132017. Despite these gains, measles remains endemic in many regions of the world including Africa, Western Pacific, South East Asia, and Europe, and measles has resurged in previously low-incidence areas (e.g., regions within Europe and the Americas) with epidemics attributable to importation of cases and suboptimal immunization coverage [32\u201334].

Influenza viruses bind to sugar moieties on the surface of airway epithelial cells where early viral replication, propagation, and shedding occur during an average 1\u20132 days of incubationperiod [55\u201357]. Peak viral replication typically occurs within 4 days of symptom onset and resolves within 7\u201310 days, lasting longer in children and immunocompromised hosts [58\u201360]. On average one person infects \u2014one to two additional people; however, this reproductive number (R0) varies by viral strain and social and environmental factors [61]. Viral infection impairs the airway mucosal barrier and disrupts the alveolar-capillary membrane contributing to leakage of fluid and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space which impairs gas exchange resulting in hypoxemia [62, 63]. Bacterial coinfection often complicates severe cases contributing to respiratory failure and death, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species as predominant copathogens [64]. Seasonal influenza virus infection is largely limited to the respiratory tract; however, H5 and H7 HPAI viruses have a polybasic cleave site within the hemagglutinin allowing for replication outside of the respiratory tract [65, 66].

Respiratory tract dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages are early targets of infection where during an average 8- to 12-day incubation period measles replicates and spreads to local lymphatics and respiratory epithelium and then disseminates in blood via infected lymphocytes to epithelial and endothelial cells in most organs [69\u201371]. The infectious period begins with fever onset and extends for several days after rash appears [72]. The estimated R0 of measles is 9\u201318 dependent upon host susceptibility and social and environmental factors [73]. Measles infects and disrupts tissues throughout the body;however, severe disease is primarily due to lower respiratory tract and neurological complications [72]. Natural measles infection confers lifelong immunity, and passive transfer of maternal antibodies protects newborns during the early postnatal period [74]. Individuals who recover from measles infection are at increasedrisk of secondary infection [75, 76].",

Most infections are self-limited resolving within 1\u20132 weeks. Upper or lower airway complications include otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia with or without bacterial coinfection [63, 64, 102]. Risk factors for severe infection include age >65 years or <5 years; pregnancy; preexisting respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, or metabolic conditions; immunosuppression; andobesity. Progressive lethargy and shortness of breath, typically within 5 days of symptom onset, suggest development of lower respiratory tract complications which may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death in severe cases [64]. Pneumonia due to influenza infection alone versus influenza and bacterialcoinfection cannot be reliably distinguished by clinical or radiological grounds, and so a high index of suspicion is needed. Influenza complications outside of the respiratory tract include exacerbation of underlying heart disease including ischemic heart disease and heart failure, myocarditis, encephalopathy,and encephalitis [103].",

The incubation period was 7\u201319 days and was followed by fever onset (38.5\u201340.5 \u00b0C), headaches, backaches, vomiting, and diarrhea [51]. Lesions first appeared on mucous membranes (including the tongue, palate, and pharynx) ~1 day prior to macular rash development, where lesions began on the face followed by proximal regions of the extremities, the trunk, and the distal extremities. Lesion development followed a centrifugal dispersionpattern, typically most dense on the face, with papules appearing within 2 days of macular rash development. Papules became vesicular ~2\u20134 days later followed by a pustular stage (5\u20137 days postrash) that peaked ~10 days postrash. Pustule resolution quickly followed and was accompanied by lesion flattening, fluid reabsorption, hardening, and scab formation (14\u201321 days postrash). Rao proposed for ordinary type smallpox to be further subdivided based on the macular rash pattern [125]. These included discrete ordinary-type smallpox\n, characterized by discrete skin lesions; , where pustular skin lesions were confluent on the face and extremities; and , where skin lesions were confluent on the face but disparate over the rest of the body. Modified-type smallpox, where lesions were less numerous than in ordinary-type smallpox, was primarily associated with vaccinated individuals and had an accelerated nonfatal disease course [125]. Flat-type and hemorrhagic-type smallpox were the most lethalforms of the disease but were also very rare (~7% and 3% of patients, respectively) [51]. Flat-type smallpox had high CFRs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated patients (97% and 67%, respectively). Hemorrhagic-type smallpox was nearly 100% fatal in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and death normally came prior to macular rash development. The clinical symptoms of flat-type smallpox were more severe during the prodromal period and did not subside. Skin lesions were flat and often black or dark purple. Respiratory complications were common and patients were febrile throughout disease. Death typically occurred 8\u201312 days post-fever onset. Hemorrhagic-type smallpox could be divided into early and late hemorrhagic-type smallpox. The early form was characterized by hemorrhage (primarily subconjunctival) early in the disease course. Generalized erythema,petechiae, and ecchymosis within 2 days of fever and flat matter lesions formed across the entire body surface. Lesions turned purple by day 4 with death by day 6 as a result of cardiac and pulmonary complications. In the late form, hemorrhages occurred following rash development and death followed between8 and 10 days post-fever onset.",

Consequently, efforts are underway to develop a vaccine that would protect against most or all influenza strains [135]. Three classes of drugs are licensed for the treatment of influenza in the United States [136]. Adamantanes, including amantadine and rimantadine,are not currently recommended given resistance of circulating seasonal strains. Baloxavir morboxil, a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza [137]. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and intravenous peramivir. Prophylactic use of NAIs is recommended in unvaccinated individuals with risk factors for severe disease and during institutional outbreaks to limit spread. Therapeutic use is recommended for individuals with suspected or confirmed influenza that have developed or are at high risk for influenza complications [26].

Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope and project from the viral surface. Matrix (M1) protein underlies the envelope, and M2 forms an ion channel within the envelope. Eight single-stranded RNA genome segments are coated with nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the polymerase complex. Nuclear export protein (NEP) mediates export of viral RNA. Influenza has estimated reproductive number (R0) between 1 and 2. Standard, droplet, and contract precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (b) virus is pleomorphic in shape. Hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope, and matrix (M) protein underlies the envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N) and bound by the polymerase complex. Measles has an estimate R0 between 9 and 18. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (c) are spherical in shape. Spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N). SARS and MERS have an estimated R0 of <1\u20132. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (d) are oval to brick shaped. The biconcave viral core contains double-stranded DNA and several proteins organized as a nucleosome and surrounded by a core membrane. Two proteinaceous lateral bodies flank the core, and a single lipid membrane surrounds the cell-associated form of the mature virion (MV). A second host-derived lipid envelope covers the extracellular virion (EV). Smallpox has an estimated R0 between 4 and 6. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission of smallpox",
