Furthermore, the significance of virus detection and its relationship to lower airway neutrophilic inflammation is poorly studied. Objectives: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of NPA for detecting respiratory viruses in BAL; and to determine the relationship between viruses and lower airway neutrophilia in children with non-acute respiratory illness. Study design: 150 paired NPA and BAL samples were obtained from 75 children aged <18 years undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for investigation of chronic respiratory symptoms. Viral studies were performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cellularity studies were performed on BALs. Diagnostic parameters of NPA compared to BAL and associations between viruses and lower airway %neutrophils were evaluated. Results: NPA had a higher yield than BAL for detection of any respiratory virus (52 versus 38, respectively). NPA had a high sensitivity (92%) and low specificity (57%) for detecting HRV in BAL with poor kappa agreement value of 0.398 (95% CI 0.218-0.578, p < 0.001).

A higher yield of hMPV was seen in NPA compared to BAL, with comparable rates of IFAV, HPIV, RSV, HCoV and HRV [6] . Diagnostic accuracy of NPA for BAL was not assessed in this study [6] . The second study used paired specimens, obtained from 21 participants on 92 occasions, and compared induced sputum to NPA for detection of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis. HRV was the most common virus identified and was present in the same frequency (21.7%) in NPA and sputum. Concordance rates were higher than in the present study (87% for HRV and 92% for other viruses), with higher sensitivity and specificity (70% and 91.7%, respectively) [15] . The third study compared paired nasal wash/tracheal suction specimens to BAL in terms of RSV detection in 6 participants, and found BAL was superior for detection of RSV using antigen detection and culture methods (insensitive methods when compared to PCR) [5] . Studies directly comparing NPA to BAL have focused on atypical pneumonia. The first study evaluated Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and the second compared detection methods for mycoplasma pneumonia. Both studies found high concordance between NPA and BAL. However, in contrast to our findings, in both studies, BAL had a higher yield of positive detections than NPA. Interestingly, in the study on mycoplasma pneumonia, BAL positivity was associated with increased lower airway %neutrophils, however, NPA positivity was not.

Previous studies have found HRV to have greater propensity to infect the nasopharynx and proximal lower airways than the distal airways or alveoli [16] . This may be related to HRV's ability to replicate optimally at cooler temperatures of the upper airway [17] , although this finding is inconsistent across HRV types [18] . In vivo studies demonstrate that HRV induces minimal epithelial cytotoxicity with only a small subset of nasal and bronchial mucosal cells becoming infected [16, 19, 20] . These factors may explain why HRV is an uncommon cause of pneumonia, except in the immune-compromised host [21] . Whilst HRV and HAdV can both cause uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection [22] , disease manifestation differs at the severe end of the spectrum. HRV has been shown to play an important role in asthma exacerbations [23] ; HAdV has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis [24] .

However, certain HAdV types can cause prolonged host shedding [30] with intermittent viral excretion over months to years [31, 32] . In contrast, HRVs usually do not persist. Garnett et al. postulate that \"smoldering HAdV at the site of lung inflammation\" may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults [33] .

Hence, these findings may not be readily extrapolated to healthy children or to those with acute lower respiratory tract illness. This is particularly pertinent to influenza and RSV, as there were very few children in whom these viruses were detected. Secondly, we used neutrophilic lower airway inflammation as a surrogate marker for active pulmonary disease, as used by other authors [34, 35] . We did not, however, test for additional indirect markers of viral infection such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), interferon gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10) or virus-specific antibodies.
