Perhaps because hygiene does not require clever new technologies or products, or perhaps because it is a domestic and personal issue largely affecting women and children, and perhaps because it concerns the neglected diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases (still the two biggest killers of children), hygiene is still very much overlooked in public health. There are signs that the situation is beginning to improve. Governments and funding agencies increasingly accept that hygiene promotion should play a part in health investments across the wider community, not just in health-care settings. Policy makers are also realising that the health benefits of increased investment in water and sanitation infrastructure are largely delivered through improvements in personal and domestic hygiene.2 Original approaches using new insights are modernising the hygiene sector, making it more attractive to investors.",

Among these avoidable infections prevention of diarrhoeal diseases is most important. Because the source of infections is human faecal material, the most important hygiene behaviours are clearly those that keep faecal matter out of the domestic environment. Adequate handwashing after contact with faeces is also crucial (after one's own defecation, after handling the faeces of children, or after contact with a faeces-contaminated environment). Other ways of preventing the faecal\u2013oral transmission of infections include keeping water, foods, and surfaces free of faecal contamination and preventing carriage by flies. Safe food handling and preparation is also important, especially for children, as is the avoidance of animal faeces and the safe storage and use of water.3 Other diseases that can be prevented by adequate hygiene include respiratory infections, trachoma, and skin infections. Endoparasites, such as roundworm and hookworm, and ectoparasites including scabies and fleas, can also be avoided.",

Second, they can use risk mapping\u2014for example, modelling of the transfer of microbes between surfaces and hosts in homes and hospitals4 or use of the hazard analysis critical control points method for assessing risk in food preparation.5 However, these approaches depend on access to good estimates of environmental contamination, which are largely unavailable for developing countries. Third, health practitioners can use correlations between recorded practices and disease incidence from observational studies. These data are more readily available, but can be misleading.6 Hygiene behaviour is commonly associated with socioeconomic factors, such as wealth, education, access to water, and modern lifestyle attitudes,7 all of which influence the risk of infectious disease. Such strong socioeconomic confounding is difficult, if not impossible, to address analytically.8\n",

Trials on this topic can be complex and the results misleading; it is hard to mask participants to the nature of the intervention, which can lead to bias in outcome reporting. One way to improve this situation is to use more objective outcome measures, such as health-care seeking, assessments by health-care workers masked to intervention status, or mortality. Future hygiene trials need to be larger to model full-scale programme implementation and more intensive (and therefore costly) than previous trials to objectively assess outcomes. Large, adequately funded trials are urgently needed to assess the effects of intervening to improve three key practices in particular: handwashing, safe disposal of child stools, and promotion of food hygiene.",

Poor environmental conditions, such as lack of water, sanitation, and drainage, have a role. Other obstacles include the absence of hard surfaces that can easily be kept clean, unavailability of cleaning materials such as soap and surface cleansers, and limited access to hygiene aids, such as potties or nappies. Local social structures and cultural norms, as well as individual psychological factors, also help to keep present practices locked in place. For behaviour to change one, or several, of these factors will have to be addressed, but to do so will require a better understanding of them. Several formative research studies that aimed to provide an understanding to enable the design of effective handwash programmes have investigated the behavioural aspects of hygiene.65, 66, 67\n",

Three kinds of hygiene behaviour were identified: habitual, motivated, and planned.56 Hygiene habits were learnt at an early age, but soap use was rarely taught by parents or schools. Key motivations for handwashing were disgust of contamination on hands and to do what everyone else was perceived to be doing (social norms). Other motivations included comfort and nurturance (the desire to care for one's children). Planned handwashing, with the aim of preventing disease, took place rarely. Mothers did not find the threat of diarrhoeal disease particularly relevant and found the connection between handwashing and possible diarrhoea in children tenuous. Mothers did, however, plan to teach their children good manners, and they also planned to economise by ensuring that soap was not wasted. Aunger and colleagues68 observed that habit was the most powerful determinant of handwashing in Kenya, followed by several motives including disgust, and social norms, and cognitive plans to save money. An investigation into nurses' handwashing in Australia saw evidence of a similar distinction between planned and motivated or habitual handwashing behaviour.69 A study of routine behaviour and hygiene in rural India suggested that some handwashing behaviours are deeply embedded in daily routines and hence highly habitual, whereas others are motivated by the transient disgust or discomfort of having dirty hands.70\n",

An experimental study71 in Australia recently reported that promoting disgust led to increased handwashing in a public toilet, as it did in a service station intervention in the UK.62 A national handwash programme in Ghana that used disgust and nurture to motivate handwashing increased self-reported handwashing before eating by 41% and after defecation by 13%.51 Disgust was also used humorously in an urban social marketing programme in Burkina Faso. The project increased observed handwashing with soap by mothers from 1% to 17% after using the toilet and from 13% to 31% after cleaning up a child (panel 1\n).72 A norms-based message, \u201cIs the person next to you washing with soap?\u201d, worked best to encourage handwashing in a motorway service station in the south of England.62 Other promising approaches, such as trying to establish hygiene habits in schools, are thought to be effective. Unpublished evidence from Kenya, Peru, and Uganda suggests that working through schools might have a double advantage: children take up what they are taught and might also take messages home, hence influencing their families.Panel 1Programme Saniya in Burkina FasoProgramme Saniya aimed to improve handwashing and stool disposal behaviour in the town of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. Based on principles of social marketing, including use of existing respected in-depth research, the programme was tailored to local customs and targeted specific types of behaviour, built on existing motivations for hygiene (social and aesthetic rather than health-based), and used locally appropriate channels of communication, including neighbourhood committees, street theatre, schools, and local radio. After the programme had run for 3 years, three-quarters of the mothers targeted had been involved with programme activities and half could cite the two main messages of the programme correctly. Although the safe disposal of children's stools changed little between 1995 and 1998 (80% before intervention and 84% after), handwashing with soap after cleaning a child's bottom rose from 13% to 31%. The proportion of mothers who washed their hands with soap after using the latrine increased from 1% to 17%.2 The estimated household and societal cost savings associated with the programme far outweighed its costs.4\n",

However, knowledge about possible long-term health effects does not necessarily translate into practice. There is little proof that such educational approaches are effective, either in developing,73, 74 or developed countries.75 In the past two decades an approach known as PHAST (participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation) has become the predominant model among non-government organisations. Although it is an imaginative attempt to involve communities in solving their own hygiene problems, PHAST is mostly an educational approach, is heavily reliant on the skills of trained facilitators, and is difficult to implement on a large scale. There are no rigorously collected data to support the effectiveness of PHAST programmes, and some evidence from Tanzania and Uganda indicates that the approach has limited effect on hygiene behaviour. Community health clubs were successful and cost effective in promoting sanitation and hygiene in two districts of Zimbabwe (panel 2\n),76 largely because communal activities can change local norms.Panel 2Community health clubs in ZimbabweThe innovative method of community health clubs used in Zimbabwe significantly changed hygiene behaviour and built rural demand for sanitation.76 Villagers were invited to a series of weekly sessions where one health topic was debated and then action plans formulated. These proved highly popular with mothers. In 1 year in Makoni District, 1244 health sessions were held by 14 trainers, costing an average of US$0\u00b721 per beneficiary and involving 11 450 club members. In Tsholotsho District, 2105 members participated in 182 health promotion sessions held by three trainers which cost $0\u00b755 for each beneficiary. Club members' hygiene was significantly different (p<0\u00b70001) from a control group regarding 17 key hygiene practices including toilet building and handwashing. The authors of the study concluded that if a strong community structure is developed and the norms of a community are altered, sanitation and hygiene behaviour are likely to improve.76\n",

The most promising approach is that developed by the Global Public\u2013Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (panel 3\n).Panel 3The Global Public\u2013Private Partnership for Handwashing with SoapConceived as a way of combining the expertise and resources of the private and public sectors, the Global Public\u2013Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap (PPP-HW) has been building coalitions and national programmes in over 17 developing countries. Usually based out of ministries of health, the programmes aim to work at national scale. The use of formative research to investigate the determinants of handwashing behaviour,1 use of professional creative agencies to design coherent, attractive, and outstanding national communications strategies with advice from industrial marketers, and attempts to evaluate programmes rigorously are also key features. Good preliminary results were achieved after 1 year of programme activities in Ghana and the model is convincing and innovative enough to have attracted substantial funds, but questions about effectiveness remain.In Ghana, Peru, and Senegal public health authorities and soap companies were not always easy bedfellows, and national partnerships can be hard to sustain for longer than just one campaign. Partnerships require constant attention from a full-time coordinator skilled in reconciling public and private stakeholders. Coordinators must be able to secure commitment for the approach at the highest levels and keep the vision alive through constant change of personnel in both sectors (for example, from 2003 to 2009: Peru had six ministers of health).It is a key objective of these partnerships to gather rigorous public domain evidence about the effectiveness of large-scale handwashing promotion efforts. However, gathering such data is proving challenging, especially when interventions cannot be centrally controlled because they depend on the goodwill of various partners.For the future, some of the most promising initiatives arising from the PPP-HW's work are coming from the soap companies themselves. Unilever, for example, has made handwashing part of the social mission of the Lifebuoy brand and has pledged to bring handwashing to one billion people by 2012. Procter & Gamble and its Safeguard brand has reached 35 million children with one-on-one, school-based handwashing education and is planning to reach 100 million more by 2012.8 Colgate runs a \u201cClean Hands\u2013Good Health\u201d campaign in many countries to promote proper handwashing practices among school children with developmentally appropriate materials and a classroom curriculum. Local soap companies such as GeTrade in Ghana are also contributing their efforts. If promoting hygiene in emerging markets makes good business sense to private companies, because they can improve sales and enhance their reputations, this could lead to sustained long-term improvements in public health, as it has in developed countries.9\n",

First, governments and ministries have to stop merely talking about the need for hygiene and instead act, investing in programmes that can actually change hygiene behaviour in villages and towns where children are dying from neglected diseases. Second, hygiene promotion has to figure in the job description for health agents, from the heads of health services to the most remote rural community health worker. Third, massive efforts need to be made to train health workers in the skills of hygiene promotion. This is important because otherwise they will continue to use outdated methods and health education approaches that are demotivating because they are ineffective. Fourth, although we know enough to act now, gaps in our knowledge exist. Health research funders need to make up for some of the decades of underinvestment in hygiene. Support is needed for the research that will allow us to say with more certainty how to change hygiene behaviour on a large scale, what improved hygiene will cost, and what the financial returns will be.",

Celebrated every year on October 15, the day involves imaginative high-profile activities organised by public and private players from around the world. To become the focus of real investment, rather than good intentions, hygiene needs champions at all levels: from global, right through to village, and especially national ministries of health. Hygiene needs to find a place in national health plans and in poverty reduction strategies. Donors need to actively solicit hygiene promotion programmes and bring companies interested in promoting hygiene into the public health fold, rather than treating them with suspicion, as is sometimes the case.",

Every mother who has contact with a health worker during pregnancy or in the neonatal period needs to learn about the importance of hygiene, and handwashing in particular. Similarly, every family member who prepares food needs to know a few basic rules of food hygiene.

Links between government health bodies and private organisations could be developed on a wider and more formal basis.

Equally, the most effective use of a hygiene budget might be to cover larger areas by use of mass media, rather than to restrict efforts to villages in the process of acquiring new water facilities. Hygiene messages should always be integral to efforts promoting improved sanitation.

Far more could be done with serious investment to fill some of the important knowledge gaps about hygiene that still remain. Panel 4\nsets out crucial questions that need answering urgently if we are to be able to deliver better hygiene programming in the future.Panel 4Research priorities\nTrials of interventions to change key hygiene practices\nRandomised controlled trials are needed to test interventions to improve hygiene practices, including handwashing, safe stool disposal and food hygiene. Such studies should use objective outcomes such as clinical infection or mortality.\nTesting of hygiene interventions\nSmall-scale testing of approaches in a laboratory or community setting, as well as large-scale screening, can provide answers about what works best to change hygiene behaviour and assurance of effectiveness before interventions are rolled out at a large scale.\nThe effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and differential impact of different channels?\nAn analysis of the different routes of communication used in the Ghana PPP-HW campaign suggested that TV and radio had greater reach and impact than community events. Further analytical studies into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different channels of communication are needed. We need to know more about the differential impact of different approaches on the low-income sections of society, which are at greatest risk of death from diarrhoeal disease and have fewer resources to commit to hygiene.80 We also need data to calculate dose-response curves: how much intervention produces how much behaviour change, and hence what level of investment is most cost effective?\nDesigning effective interventions\nThe process of turning insight about behaviour into effective behaviour-changing communication is still more of an art than a science. More needs to be understood about what makes communications attention-grabbing and memorable, as well as motivating. Habit clearly has an important role in hygiene and many other health behaviours, but the topic of how to create and change habits has been little studied.6, 7\n\nMethods and models for hygiene promotion at different scales\nProven model approaches to hygiene promotion are badly needed by decentralised authorities and non-government organisations. Such agencies are often willing to implement hygiene promotion, but rarely have the specific expertise or capacity to develop the approaches themselves. Several examples of simple, effective, attractive, and costed activities and materials that have been tested and have been shown to work, are needed so that organisations can adapt these to local circumstances.\nSustaining improvements\nEven when we are successful in changing hygiene behaviours we still do not know how persistent such changes are,11, 12 or the sort of investment that is needed to maintain the gains in a given population. Perhaps the most important tasks facing hygiene promoters and soap manufacturers are to work out how to make hygiene a matter of habit and a social norm. Once hygiene is established, improvements in behaviours will be truly sustainable.\nMeasuring hygiene behaviour\nIf we cannot accurately measure changes in hygiene behaviour we cannot measure the effectiveness of interventions in trials or evaluate the delivery of behaviour change in programmes. Because hygiene behaviour is private and morally loaded, simple questionnaire surveys give overestimates of behaviours such as handwashing, whereas direct observation is cumbersome and intrusive, and technological fixes, such as Smart Soap (containing accelerometers that record usage) have drawbacks too.14 Simple, cheap, and widely applicable methods of measuring hygiene behaviour change are still needed.\nTechnological, consumer, and business model innovation\nAlthough simple technologies, such as water-saving taps, nappies, potties, and child-friendly toilets, can help families to live more hygienically, little effort has been made to develop and market hygiene-helping products that are appropriate for the consumers with low income. Three things are needed: exploration of the design space for the products that the poorest consumers need and want,16 the adaptation or creation of technologies, products, and services that meet those needs, and the development of business models that can operate profitably and be sustained on a large scale.",
