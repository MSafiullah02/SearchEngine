The COVID-19 pandemic is considered historical because very few of us today 81 were alive when the last pandemic of similar scale (the Spanish flu) plagued the world. It is 82 unprecedented because a pandemic in a globalized and interconnected world like the one we are 83 currently living in has never occurred before [7] . However, this pandemic was expected and 84 governments had prepared contingency plans. Nevertheless, Morse's paper expressed the concern 85 that \"unless effective action against pandemic flu is taken now, we are in \"dire straits,\"\" [8] . 86 Indeed, as immunization was the cornerstone of countries' strategy, with antiviral agents as a 87 backup, producing and distributing a vaccine was estimated to take at the very least 4 to 6 months. 88 The contingency plans therefore focused on nonpharmacological interventions, such as hand 89 washing, \"respiratory etiquette,\" face masks, school closures, and social distancing or isolation. to declare a global pandemic [10] . (The number of cases, deaths and the dates detailed in this 96 paper are the official numbers accessible by the authors at the time of writing. As the crisis 97 continues to unfold and the COVID-19 disease continues to spread, these numbers and dates may 98 be subject to change.) On April 20 th , 2020, the total number of known cases was greater than 2.36 99 million worldwide [11] . By then almost a third of the world's population was under some form of 100 lockdown. There is a lot of subject matter related to this COVID-19 crisis that is, and will remain, 101 hard to assess (speed of transmission, likelihood of survival, economic consequences etc.). An 102 important issue is how to communicate uncertainty and share information when so little is actually 103 .

The behavioural response to COVID-19 is unavoidably collective. Each person's chance 104 of contracting the virus depends not only on their own behaviour, but also on the behaviour of their 105 fellow citizens [12] . 106 This paper proposes to review the published literature on the successful leveraging of 107 behavioural insights during past epidemics and on the data available at time of writing on the 108 current pandemic. Whilst countries response worldwide was predominantly national, how global 109 leaders embraced the diversity of the behavioural insights specific to their own citizens to design 110 the landing page of their governmental institutions' website will be assessed. It will be shown that 111 far from expectations, the response to the sanitary crisis was very consensual with countries 112 implementing 80% of the behavioural insights observed. The research shows that beyond this 113 consensus, the individual and social nudges had no impact on the number of cases and deaths of 114 COVID-19 observed and instead it was the environmental interventions that had a significant 115 impact. What are the drivers that explain these results will be later discussed. 118 Understanding a global population's response to a worldwide pandemic such as COVID-19 is not 119 straightforward and requires rigorous analysis. Below are four putative applications of behavioural 120 science that are relevant to understanding this. 1. Behavioural science can not only be used as a 121 powerful tool to understand humans, 2. it is key to drafting impactful and targeted messages to 122 support crisis communication techniques and to ensure that what is conveyed is heard and 123 perceived as intended. 3. Behavioural science insights can help leverage the feeling of belonging 124 and 4. finally can be used to direct human behaviours toward outcomes [13] .",

Hand-597 washing can prevent life-threatening diseases, and even save lives [85] , but if people are not 598 directly exposed to the threat and don't visually see its impact on their own family or community, 599 they may feel an \"optimism bias\" that leads them to underestimate the risk [86].

Research showed that Public-spirited behaviour was most 245 likely when there was clear and frequent communication, strong group identity, and social 246 disapproval for those who don't comply [47]. This was evidenced by the social media survey 247 mentioned above that showed that 90% of respondents believed social distancing measures were 248 effective and 70% felt that risky behaviours should be financially punished [48]. Research shows 249 that authorities often overestimate the risk of panic [49], and whilst in some populations, for no 250 logical reason, people overpurchased specific goods such as toilet paper, this was not the most 251 common reaction. Further, this compulsive purchasing has been shown to be a psychological 252 response to the need of being in control of something. \"When deciding whether to engage with 253 proposed health solutions, people consider not only their susceptibility to the threat and its severity, 254 but how effective they perceive the solution to be and the nature of the required behaviour\" [50]. 255 \"One of the most effective arguments to promote compliance with isolation is that self-isolation 256 in response to symptoms is the best way for all of us to prevent infecting each other\" [51].

Indeed, whilst \"end-use behaviour can determine what happens in a situation, design behaviour often determines the situation itself\"[15].Behavioural science uses multiple behavioural levers such as social influence, convenience, prompts, and cues [16] all tools that can impact what is known as the \"Behaviour Change Wheel\" that suggests that change is only possible if capability, opportunity and motivation are aligned.\"Individuals have to be psychologically or physically able to undertake the behaviour, the 134 environment that surrounds them needs to facilitate the behaviour, and their own mental processes 135 need to energise and direct the behaviour\"[17].

Behavioural Science gives relevant insights on how best to address populations with lifechanging news. Clarity in the messages that the governments convey is essential to ensure 139 readability and understanding. Research has shown that clarity and certainty about timelines are 140 both important [19] and that \"messages linked to disgust tend to be more effective than messages 141 that communicate social norms\" [20]. Further, plans are easier to follow if they are time-specific 142 and intentional, rather than general aspirations [21]. Co-operation is increased by clear statements, articulated by leaders and repeated by others, of a desired collective behaviour that is in the group 144 interest. This can enhance trust, establish social norms and encourage individuals to commit to the 145 behaviour [22]. Consequently, behavioural science helps design messages that elicit emotions 146 other than fear such as 'empathy appeals' that can have positive impacts on behaviour change [23].",

Even in acute healthcare environments, attempts to improve hand hygiene and other infection 177 control behaviours through education and awareness have limited and short-term impacts [31].

People's behaviour is influenced by social norms such as what they perceive that others are doing or what they think that others approve or disapprove of [33]. Further, individuals 181 struggle to perceive risks accurately and distort probability when making decisions, with substantial differences [34]. Appealing to fear leads people to change their behaviour if they feel capable of dealing with the threat, but leads to defensive reactions when they feel helpless to act 184 [35].
