For example, it is well known that genetic polymorphism of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), influences the natural history of HIV-1 infection. The mutant allele CCR5-D32 does not produce a functional protein and has been shown to protect host cells against HIV-1 infection, and progression into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is delayed after seroconversion takes place [Dean et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1996; Samson et al., 1996] .

Human full-length ACE2 cDNAs have been cloned already from lymphoma (GenBank accession No. AF241254) [Tipnis et al., 2000] , cardiac left ventricle (AF291820) [Donoghue et al., 2000] and testis (AY623811) [Douglas et al., 2004] . Based on published data, it has been said that the ACE2 gene (ACE2) contains 18 exons, and spans approximately 40 kb of genomic DNA on the human X-chromosome. Although ACE2 mRNA expressions were demonstrated in the lung by the method of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT/PCR) [Harmer et al., 2002] and its protein expression was obviously shown by immunohistochemistry [Hamming et al., 2004] , full-length ACE2 cDNA has not been cloned from the lung so far.

            "text": "Using the PCR-based cloning procedure, we identified for the first time an alternative exon upstream of the original exon 1 of ACE2 that is expressed in various organs, including the lung and trachea, primary-cultured bronchial epithelial cells, and the small intestine. These are considered to be important replication sites of SARS-CoV [Haagmans et al., 2004] . Both 5 0and 3 0 -ends of the intron between the new alternative exon and the original exon 1 followed the GT/AG rule of Breathnach and Chambon [1981] . Although the organ specificity of the transcripts was not confirmed in this study due to the limitation of non-quantitative PCR amplification, implication of the new exon was definitely shown in the lung and small intestine. Also, we found the extended region of the original exon 1, 65 bp on the 5 0 side. Neither the new alternative exon nor the new extended region of exon 1 gave rise to a new coding region and they were considered as 5 0 -untranslated region.",

            "text": "It was recently reported that genetic variations of ACE2 did not affect SARS susceptibility or outcome in Hong Kong [Chiu et al., 2004] . In that study, five intronic SNPs (rs2106809, rs2285666, rs4646142, rs714205, and rs2074192) were chosen and analyzed in a case-control manner, based on the previously known exon-intron structure and SNPs already registered in the database. By contrast, we attempted to analyze not only previously known SNPs but also variations newly identified among actual SARS patients and contacts. Based on the information from the exon-intron structure of ACE2 cloned by ourselves, we searched for nucleotide sequences in all the exons including the new alternative exon and the corresponding 5 0 -flanking region, which are thought to contain promoters of the new exon and the original exon 1. We found one novel non-synonymous substitution N638S and 18 non-coding SNPs including two relatively common SNPs with minor allele frequency higher than 5%. We selected these SNPs and analyzed them furthermore in a case-control manner, because, while they are rare occurrence, non-synonymous substitution may directly modulate the function of the protein, and because relatively common SNPs can often be used as markers to ascertain a causative variation. Of 19 SNPs found in this study, 13 were new polymorphisms, 3 of which were located in 3 0 -UTR. Two possible non-synonymous SNPs in dbSNP database were not found in the population tested. Judging from the results so far obtained in this case-control study, there was no statistical evidence that ACE2 polymorphisms affect SARS infection or alter its clinical course. However, type II error was not negligible because of a relatively small size of samples tested.",

Nevertheless, this newly identified alternative 5 0 -untranslated exon expressed in the lung, and also newly recognized polymorphisms in this study might be of great help concerning investigations into the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the possible significance of the variations in further more in-depth studies.",
