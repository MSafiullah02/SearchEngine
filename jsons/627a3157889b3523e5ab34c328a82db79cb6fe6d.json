Bacteriophages are not a stable part of water micro-flora and their presence is usually associated with wastewater inflow rich in animal and human excrement [58] . Their survivability depends upon physico-chemical environmental conditions [59] . Somatic coliphages have been found to outnumber F-RNA phages in waste water and raw water sources by a factor of about 5, and cytopathogenic human viruses by about 500 [60, 61] , thus making them valuable indicators for assessing the behaviour of and the possible presence of enteric viruses in water environments.

Increasing in the phage and VLP populations from upstream to the river mouth were observed in all seasons. This was probably because the river flows through the more urbanised areas of Durban and is subject to higher surface runoff [63] . It can be speculated that increased human activity as well as informal settlements and trading activities in the storm water drain catchment areas contributed to the high levels of phage populations downstream the river at points U1, U2 and U3.

The twostep filtration procedure used in our laboratory involved fluid flowing parallel to the 0.22 mm TFF filter surface. Particles with molecular weights (M w ) smaller than the exclusion size (0.22 mm) of the filter passed through and collected (filtrate) in a reservoir which was further concentrated through a 100 kDa spiral wound TFF unit. Particles with larger molecular weights were retained and recycled to the original reservoir (retentate). Thus, as the filtration continued, the retentate volume decreased until the desired volume was attained. The TEM study demonstrated that the two-step TFF procedure coupled with ultracentrifugation produced a viral concentrate devoid of bacteria, with most viruses being intact. The phage/VLPs concentrations in every sample were high enough to view on formvar coated electron microscopic grids without enrichment. All water samples in this study contained a mixture of morphologically different tailed phage viruses, which were regarded as bacteriophages. It was possible to observe viral particles with long tails (B1-Siphoviridae), short tails (A1-Myoviridae and C1-Podoviridae), and without tails. The phages particles observed without tails may belong to a wide range of hosts, including eukaryotes [66] . Most of the phages from the Umgeni River were intact, with discrete structures such as tail fibres, base plates, and other appendages which are pertinent for the recognition of and interaction with the host cell. These accessories may be an indication that a significant proportion of the phages are suspended in the water environment as potentially infective particles. The main purposes of phage classification are generalisation and simplification, which facilitates comparisons and understanding of viruses [67] . The high morphological diversity of phage communities corresponds well with the great variability and dynamics of bacterial populations obtained in this current study. Electron microscopy provides a direct insight into the morphological variability of phage present in the water environment, without being dependent on the isolation of suitable host strains. This is important, as bacteria which are not cultivable under laboratory conditions usually dominate aquatic environments and may be important phage hosts [68] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1383, "end": 1387, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1905, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2426, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Great morphological variability was observed in the virus assemblage's from the Umgeni River, which suggests that these viruses may also be diverse in terms of the hosts that they infect. Most of the viruses were detected downstream of the river towards the river mouth area during the spring and summer seasons. The viral contamination of these widely used areas could be attributed to storm water discharge, surface runoff, sewage discharge and overflows, recreational exposure and other anthropogenic activities [63] . The detection of viruses by TEM in the sampling points upstream of the Umgeni River was relatively low or nonexistent, probably due to the stagnant waters and limited recreational exposure. Several presumptive virus types including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae (norovirus), Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus), Picornaviridae (enterovirus), Poxviridae and Reoviridae (rotavirus) were found in the Umgeni River during all seasons based on the morphologies under TEM. Human viruses seen in negative stains fall into one of two major morphological categories: enveloped or naked [64] . Enveloped viruses have a nucleocapsid (the nucleic acid held together by some structural proteins) inside, whilst naked viruses are icosahedral, their protein coat or capsid is more rigid and withstands the drying process well to maintain their spherical structure in negative stains [50] . Naked human viruses are of three size ranges: (i) 22-35 nm (e.g. parvoviruses, enteroviruses and caliciviruses), (ii) 40-55 nm (polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses) and (iii) 70 \u00c2 90 nm (reoviruses, rotaviruses and adenoviruses) [69] . As a general pattern, the virus population was dominated by small forms (<40 nm), and tails were rarely seen, which is in agreement with the results reported by several authors [66, [70] [71] [72] . The negative staining technique for TEM allowed for the examination of particulate material including determination of structure and size of particles and has proved important in virological studies [50] . All water samples analysed were environmental in nature, thus natural degradation may have altered the morphological features of the viruses substantially [50] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1130, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1657, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1841, "text": "[66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1846, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1851, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2062, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2224, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The application of PCR-based molecular technology and TEM has advanced our knowledge of the occurrence and prevalence of human viruses in water. However, it has provided no information on viral viability and infectivity in a specific environment. The tissue culture assay is the only US EPA approved method for virus infectivity monitoring in aquatic samples [73] . Virology laboratories have traditionally used tissue culture cell lines to amplify the amount of virus present in a water sample, express the viral antigens and in many cases monitor the cell death as a consequence of the viral infection producing characteristic CPEs in the cell monolayer. The tissue culture technique has been used extensively for virus replication and infectivity studies and plaque assays [74] . It has been established that for the recovery of a maximum number of infectious viruses, it is often necessary to inoculate each sample type into several different cell culture lines because no single cell culture is available with susceptibility to all enteric virus types [74] . In the present study six cell lines (the A549, HEK293, Hela, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5 and Vero) were used to determine CPE of the VLPs from the Umgeni River during four seasons. All VLP samples from all sites and seasons produced substantial CPEs on the Vero, HEK293, Hela and A549 cell lines. This effect was tested against positive controls of three known viruses (voxsackievirus, rotaviruses and adenovirus) in the same cell lines. Vero cells are sensitive to infection with many different viruses [74] . Human embryonic kidney cell line 293A and human lung carcinoma cell line A549 were the most penetrating to viral infection, especially to enteric adenovirus 40 and 41 [75] . Grabow et al. [76] reported the propagation of both enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41 in the primary liver carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5) cell line. Hep-G2 cell lines are often used to study Hepatitis B, C and other viruses [74] . CPE of the VLPs was examined by microscopy every day for the first week of growth to maximise the detection of viral progression. Certain viruses take one day to three weeks to yield a CPE dependent on the initial concentration and virus type. CPE can be swelling, shrinking, rounding of cells to grouping or whole destruction of the monolayer [77] . All the VLPs isolated from water samples were capable of inducing the CPEs on six tissue cell lines. The ability of these viruses to infect susceptible host cells and to replicate their DNA/RNA, confirms that they are viable and infectious and therefore constitute a health risk which is due to be investigated [18, 78] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1561, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1756, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1954, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2305, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2619, "end": 2623, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2627, "text": "78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, different approaches to determine viral pollution during four seasons and at five sampling points in the Umgeni River were comparatively evaluated.

The results produced suggest the infectious potentials of the VLPs in the Umgeni River water samples, especially river water from the lower catchment areas, to infect the human hosts throughout the year. These observations have serious health care implications if raw untreated water is used for human consumption.
