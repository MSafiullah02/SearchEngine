There is a need to demonstrate the clinical impact of using the new, rapid and sensitive molecular assays in prospectively designed studies. Objectives: To study the impact on medical management of a rapid molecular assay in patients with respiratory infections. Study design: A prospective, randomized, non-blinded study was performed in patients presenting to the Emergency Department during two respiratory seasons (2016)(2017). Diagnosis was performed by FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray-RP) or by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: A total of 432 patients (156 children and 276 adults) were analyzed. Diagnosis with FilmArray-RP was associated with significant changes in medical management including withholding antibiotic prescriptions (OR:15.52, 95%CI:1.99-120.83 in adults and OR:12.23, 95%CI:1.56-96.09 in children), and reduction in complementary studies in children (OR:9.64, 95%CI:2.13-43.63) compared to IFA. Decrease in oseltamivir prescriptions was significantly higher in adults in the FilmArray-RP group (p = 0.042; OR:1.19, 95%CI:0.51-2.79) compared to adults managed with IFA. Diagnostic yield was significantly higher by FilmArray-RP (81%) than by IFA (31%)(p < 0.001). The median time from sample collection to reporting was 1 h 52 min by FilmArray-RP and 26 h by IFA (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The high respiratory viruses' detection rate and availability of results within two hours when using FilmArray-RP were associated with decreases in antibiotic prescriptions and complementary studies and more accurate use of oseltamivir.",

Empiric treatment with antibiotics is frequently initiated even when viral infection is a strong possibility, leading to unnecessary antibiotic use [3, 4] . Direct diagnosis of respiratory viruses by antigen detection using immunofluorescence assays (IFA), is still used but is typically limited to eight viruses ( [RSV] ) and may lack sensitivity depending on the viral titer, patient\u00b4s age and time of testing in relation to the onset of symptoms [5] . Molecular methods increase viral detection due to a greater analytic sensitivity compared to conventional methods such as antigen detection and/or viral culture. Additional increased yield results from the detection of respiratory viruses that are not effectively detected by conventional methods, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses.",

The short TAT from sample collection to reported results gave physicians the option to adjust empirical decisions and change medical management during the ED consultation, leading to decreased antibiotic prescriptions and complementary studies and permitting a more targeted use of oseltamivir.",
