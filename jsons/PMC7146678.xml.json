We report the experience in our transplant centre, in the midst of the current outbreak in Lombardy, Italy (10 million inhabitants; 25 124 ascertained infections, and 7199 virus-related deaths as of March 31, 2020).2 Three of our 111 long-term liver transplant survivors (transplanted more than 10 years ago) have died in the past 3 weeks (between March 5 and March 18) following severe COVID-19 disease. All three were male, older than 65 years, receiving antihypertensive drugs, overweight (BMI >28 kg/m2), with hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes (median HbA1c of 6\u00b79%). The post-transplant course had been uneventful for all three patients, and their immunosuppressive regimen had been gradually tapered off, with very low trough concentrations of calcineurin inhibitors (two patients receiving ciclosporin [28 and 35 ng/mL, respectively] and one receiving tacrolimus [2\u00b71 ng/mL]). All three patients died after admission to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia, and were in need of supplementary oxygen at admission but rapidly developed severe respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical ventilation. The patients died between 3 and 12 days after the onset of pneumonia; all three patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs. By contrast, three of our 40 recently transplanted (ie, within the past 2 years) patients have tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, and although quarantined, are all experiencing an uneventful course of disease.",

We examined clinical and demographic data of our patients (table\n). In keeping with the paediatric data,4 immunosuppression did not seem to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Given that a reactive innate immune response might be responsible for severe clinical manifestations, immunosuppression might be protective, although this needs further clarification. Conversely, the presence of metabolic-related comorbidities, which are known to increase with time since transplant,5 might be associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, the number of COVID-19-related deaths in our series is small, and these observations can only be considered preliminary.",

However, according to this initial observation, we suggest that great attention is paid to long-term liver transplant recipients with metabolic comorbidities.
