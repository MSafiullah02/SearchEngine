The membrane (M) protein plays an important role in viral assembly together with the small membrane (E) protein. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein is contained in some MHV strains and in other species of serogroup 2 coronaviruses (reviewed in Siddell, 1995, Holmes and Lai, 1996).",

The M protein of the MHV-A59 strain has been reported to contain only O-linked oligosaccharides (Niemann et al., 1984, Krijnse Locker et al., 1992a). The O-glycosylation site is considered to be located at a cluster of four hydroxylamino acids at the NH2-terminus: Ser\u2013Ser\u2013Thr\u2013Thr immediately adjacent to the initiator Met (reviewed in Rottier, 1995). The M proteins of four other MHV strains so far sequenced also contained a well conserved hydroxylamino acid cluster forming potential O-glycosylation sites (Pfleiderer et al., 1986, Homberger, 1994). Recently de Haan et al. (1998b) clearly showed that Thr at position 5 is exclusively O-glycosylated by expressing a wide variety of mutant M proteins in mammalian cells.",

In this paper, we have demonstrated the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides attaching to MHV-2 M protein, in addition to conserved O-glycans, by means of nucleotide sequencing and biochemical analysis. The results indicate that the additional N-linked glycans make the molecular mass of MHV-2 M protein larger than other MHV M proteins with only O-linked oligosaccharides.",

The expressed MHV-2 M protein (Fig. 4, lane 4) was detected as the same molecular mass as MHV-2 viral M protein.

We have demonstrated biochemically that Asn at position 2 was N-glycosylated and that these N-glycans made the molecular mass of MHV-2 M protein larger than those of other MHV strains. de Haan et al. (1998a) previously demonstrated that an experimentally created M mutant of A59 strain with Asn at position 2 made the molecular mass of the M protein larger than that of parental A59. They also showed that Thr at position 5 and Pro at position 8 were required for O-glycosylation and that both N- and O-linked glycans were present in the mutant M protein of A59 with Asn at position 2 (de Haan et al., 1998b). Since Thr at position 5 and Pro at position 8 were conserved in MHV-2, MHV-2 M protein is considered to have both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides like mutant M protein of A59 with Asn at position 2. This paper is the first report demonstrating that an MHV strain has both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides on the M protein resulting in an increment of the molecular mass.",

Viral assembly, an event in which the M protein plays an important role, is not interfered with by the additional N-glycosylation, since equal efficiency was displayed by both the mutant M protein of A59 with N-linked oligosaccharides and the original A59 M protein lacking N-glycan in assembling in virion-like particles (de Haan et al., 1998a). MHV-2 does not induce cell-to-cell fusion on cultured DBT cells forming syncytium, as opposed to most MHV strains. However, it seems unlikely that MHV-2 M protein is responsible for non-syncytium formation, since the S protein has been demonstrated to be the only element that determines the phenotype of MHV strain with regard to syncytium formation (Yamada et al., 1997). The M protein of MHV-2 does not seem to have sufficient role in changing pathogenicity or tissue tropism, since an A59-based recombinant virus containing the entire M gene of MHV-2 produced encephalitis and hepatitis similar to parental A59 following intracerebral inoculation (Lavi et al., 1998). Further investigation is required to elucidate whether the differently modified M protein of MHV-2 is somehow involved in determining the biological characteristics of this particular strain.",
