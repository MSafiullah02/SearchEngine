However, past evolution of a protein family, such as the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators, is protohistorically recorded in the genomes of present-day cells. The lack of ancestral sequences is only one of many obstacles to tracing the evolutionary history of genes and their cellular processes. The chronological order of discovery profoundly influences nomenclature and the interpretation of evidence. Also, there are notorious hurdles in obtaining reliable alignments of divergent (but homologous) or dissimilar (analogous but not homologous) sequences, such as BH3 motifs, for use in searching available databases. Despite limitations, comparisons across species have catapulted forward our understanding of biological processes, exemplified by Bcl-2 family proteins [1]. Thus, cross-species comparisons need to be captured and understood to broaden our biological knowledge of Bcl-2 family members and their central roles in normal development and in cancer.",

Despite the usefulness of this paradigmatic classification scheme, close inspection of BH motif sequences indicates that subfamily classifications draw heavily on prior knowledge of protein functions (for details, see below). Overextension of computational methods and subjective interpretations of sequence similarities have expanded the Bcl-2 family beyond justifiable limits. To gain a better understanding, we considered the possible origins of BH motifs by applying bioinformatics and phylogenetic concepts to more rigorously identify four distinct subfamilies of the extended Bcl-2 family. Three of these (Bcl2-like, Bax-like, and Bid-like) form a monophyletic group (share a common ancestor) (Figure 3, Figure 4\n) and a fourth comprises eight unrelated (or very distantly related) canonical BH3-only proteins (Figure 2). Inclusion of these specific eight in the canonical BH3-only subgroup is also heavily dependent on prior knowledge. Bias in Bcl-2 subfamily nomenclature extends beyond amino acid sequence analysis. Assignment to anti-death or pro-death subgroups is challenging for those family members that lack obvious cell death-related phenotypes (e.g., Bok and Bcl2L13) and for those that can exhibit either anti-death or pro-death activity in different conditions or cell types. For example, Drosophila Buffy, mammalian Bcl-xL, and worm CED-9 are all traditionally categorized as antiapoptotic, but all three have also been shown to exhibit pro-death activity in vivo\n7, 8, 9. Here we illustrate the methodological and conceptual issues that have arisen in defining and classifying the various other BH3-containing proteins reported to date.",

Although several dimer interfaces have been identified between Bcl-2 family members, the best characterized is the interaction of BH3-only proteins with anti-death Bcl-2 proteins. The BH3-containing helix of BH3-only proteins inserts into a deep elongated binding cleft on anti-death Bcl-2 proteins, resulting in the inactivation of either or both binding partners 10, 11, 12. By inhibiting BH3-only proteins or by directly binding Bax (multi-BH proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog), Bcl-xL can prevent homo-oligomerization of Bax that otherwise leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP). Through MOMP, mitochondrial cytochrome c is released to act as a cytosolic cofactor for assembly of caspase-activating apoptosomes, and cell death occurs within a few minutes [13]. Because antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote tumor cell survival, BH3 mimetics have been developed as cancer therapeutics [14].",

It is widely assumed that BH4 distinguishes all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins from pro-death members that lack BH4, but solid evidence for this delineation is lacking. For instance, most multiple alignment programs fail to align the BH4 motifs of the original trio (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w) with the putative BH4 of their antiapoptotic homologs Mcl-1 and Bfl-1/A1 (Figures 2 and S1a in the supplementary information online). Furthermore, when we used InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/), a popular motif-prediction tool that searches a given sequence against a compilation of protein signatures from different databases (e.g., PROSITE, PFAM), BH4 motifs were not identified in these latter proteins or in the other antiapoptotic (Bcl-B/Bcl2L10 and Drosophila Buffy) or more distantly related proapoptotic members (Bax, Bak, and Bok) (Figures 2 and S1b,c in the supplementary information online). These sequence differences are paralleled by the sensitivity of the same three BH4-containing proteins to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, although ABT-737 does not directly contact the BH4. However, all (uncleaved) Bcl-2 family proteins contain the N-terminal helix that encompasses the BH4 motif [17].",

This BH4 is annotated in both antiapoptotic (including Mcl-1, BFL-1/A1, and Buffy) and proapoptotic members (Bax, Bak, BOK, and Bcl2L13). However, the CDD identifier (132900) refers to a protein family (PFAM) signature that captures similarities across all the Bcl-2 family (PF00452), leading to the over-prediction of BH4-containing proteins and misannotation. A more recent effort was made to redefine BH4 as a motif present in most globular Bcl-2 family proteins, including both pro- and antiapoptotic members [18]. However, when we used this novel sequence signature for database searching, it produced high false-positive rates, including multiple BH4 motifs within individual Bcl-2 family proteins (Figure 2). Defining BH4 can be further complicated by divergent sequences present on either side of helix 1 (e.g., the long N-terminal extension of Mcl-1 and the large unstructured loop between the BH4 and BH3 of Bcl-xL) (Figures 2 and S1c in the supplementary information online). Although these difficulties do not exclude the presence of an evolutionarily conserved BH4 region among all Bcl-2 paralogs (e.g., defined by specific structural contacts), currently available bioinformatics has not clearly justified this classification as a sequence motif.",

Bid has a structurally well-defined and functionally important BH3 motif and has also evolved unique functions in apoptosis 21, 22 and in the DNA damage checkpoint 23, 24, 25. By contrast, Bcl2L13 may have lost its role in apoptosis regulation [26].",

            "text": "Although it is widely assumed that all BH3-only proteins are unrelated except for their BH3, conservation of sequence similarity in their BH3 motif has not been rigorously confirmed (or dispelled, as seen in Box 1\n). Although underappreciated, the best-characterized BH3-only protein Bid (defined as lacking BH1, BH2, and BH4) in fact shares significant sequence similarity with Bcl-2 homologous proteins, consistent with its Bcl-2-like 3D structure 19, 21, 22. Thus, in contrast to current nomenclature, Bid does not belong to the subgroup of canonical BH3-only proteins, but instead belongs to a branch of the Bcl-2 phylogenetic tree with Bcl2L12, -13, -14, and -15, which generally lack C-terminal transmembrane domains (Figures 3 and S1b in the supplementary information online). Bid is an example of misclassification by applying the BH motif criteria alone; additional evidence strongly argues for an evolutionary relationship (homology) between Bid and the Bcl-2 family. Yet the criterion for direct activator-type BH3-only proteins is defined by the biochemical properties of Bid (activated/caspase-cleaved tBid or its BH3 peptide). Thus, Bid may have additional functions in apoptosis regulation, beyond its BH3.Box 1Limited tools for defining BH3 motif-containing proteins\nInformed visual inspection. BH3 motifs are typically identified by visual inspection for the characteristic Leu-X3-Gly-Asp/Glu sequence. This strategy has proven successful when searching for newly identified Bcl-2 binding partners, but without additional information this method is difficult to justify.\nBLAST searches. Some groups have used the pairwise sequence comparison program BLAST to define BH3 motifs 57, 58. However, BLAST was not designed for short peptide sequences.\nMotif searches. Published BH3 motif searches have relied mainly on deterministic sequence patterns, such as the regular expression PS01259 of the PROSITE database (InterPro signature IPR020728). When we applied this pattern to search the database (UNI60/UniProtKB with sequences \u226460% identity to avoid multiple copies of the same sequence), it recovered only two of the eight canonical BH3-only proteins, BIK and HRK (see Figure 2 in main text and Figure S2 in the supplementary information online). Several groups have defined less stringent consensus sequences in attempt to capture more of the canonical BH3-only proteins [59]. Applying their 7-mer as a search criterion, we identified only one additional BH3-only protein (Bim) and 33,558 additional putative hits (see Figure 4 in main text and Figure S2 in the supplementary information online). Similar problems arise with the reported 9-residue [54], 12-residue [55], and 13-residue regular expressions [56], one of which identified 25% of all proteins. The situation deteriorates if reported consensus patterns are modified additum (ad) to capture all of the BH3 sequences that were included in their respective published alignments (see Figures 2 and 4 in main text and supplementary information 3 online). By extending this search to plants, microorganisms and viruses, we identified putative BH3-only proteins in species that lack Bcl-2 homologs with which to interact (e.g., Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis) and that lack true mitochondria (e.g., Giardia, Trichomonas). Furthermore, there was strikingly little overlap between hit lists, and the number of hits was not significantly different when the proteomes were shuffled or reversed (rearrangements of the same amino acids) (see Figure 4 in main text and supplementary information 3 online). Thus, the number of BH3 motifs identified by these strategies is not significantly different from random chance.\nHidden Markov models. Two studies reported using the probabilistic method of profile hidden Markov models (Profile HMMs), which is known to be more sensitive and specific. This method identified a BH3 in PXT1 (Q8K459), but the assigned BH3 PFAM domain is untraceable and may not exist, and the other HMM study provided no details regarding the bioinformatic approaches 60, 61. Our experience with building HMM profiles with BH3-like proteins invariably leads to profile drift in iterated searches, indicating that these sequences collectively contribute noise. Thus, there is a lack of evidence that BH3 motifs of the Bcl-2 family proteins are significantly similar in sequence (Figure S1f,g in the supplementary information online).",

However, a large body of compelling functional and structural evidence supports the existence of a BH3-like motif in Beclin 1. Through this BH3-mediated interaction of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2 proteins, autophagy appears to be functionally linked to the control of apoptosis. Although it seems obvious that the BH3 motifs of Bcl-2 and of Beclin 1 have distinct origins, it is also possible that some BH3-only proteins currently classified as Bcl-2 family members have BH3 sequence similarities due to either random coincidence or convergent evolution (selection of the same residues for identical functional reasons). To further clarify, there is no denial that the core BH3 motif sequence Leu-X(3)-Gly-Asp is present in many proteins and can be aligned by hand in a diagram, but this does not imply that they are homologous or are functionally equivalent. Conversely, the lack of verifiable sequence similarity using currently available bioinformatics does not negate the potential importance of BH3-like motifs in biology. There may be other cases where divergence accumulated over evolutionary timescales, producing proteins that will exhibit similarities only in this short region. Thus, the denomination of BH3-only protein carries some degree of ambiguity because many proteins that logically qualify for this designation belong to different protein families and contain other (non-BH) motifs.",

Furthermore, sequence similarity of BH3 is not sufficient to automatically infer common ancestral origins [31] (Box 1). This raises the question of how BH3 motifs arose in so many diverse proteins. The most logical assumption to explain the functionally and structurally validated BH3 motifs in unrelated proteins is that they arose independently on multiple occasions (homoplasy) owing to specific constraints (either biological or physicochemical), facilitating interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins. The surprising proteome-wide prevalence of potential BH3 motifs (Box 1) suggests that they could correspond to a particular class of short linear motifs [32] used as a binding interface to connect critical components of various biological pathways to the core apoptotic machinery. As in other short linear motifs, the short length of the BH3 signature and the small number of residues involved in functional interaction make BH3 motifs likely to appear and disappear in unrelated protein sequences by random mutation. This scenario does not exclude the possibility of divergent evolution in some instances, such as between the BH3-coding exons of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bak and the BH3-only protein Bik, as we previously hypothesized 19, 20. Moreover, because 3D structure evolves more slowly than sequence, remote homologs may be found among canonical/other BH3-containing proteins as more protein structures are solved.",

            "text": "Despite considerable effort, so far no Bcl-2/Bax/Bid homologs have been found outside the metazoan phyla, apart from animal viruses 19, 35, indicating that these proteins are not present in non-metazoan species or that ancestral Bcl-2 homologs in non-metazoan species have become so dissimilar that their common origin cannot be detected from their sequences. Similar difficulties challenge the evolutionary origins of RNA viruses, where high mutation rates obscure ancestral origins [36]. It is hoped that advances in structural genomics and remote homology detection coupled with the growing size of sequence databases will make it possible to capture more ancient evolutionary events and possibly reveal connections between previously unrecognized Bcl-2-like proteins. In the meantime, we can only attempt to avoid a mammalian-centric perspective. Indeed, interacting proteins are known to evolve and coevolve in a lineage-specific manner [37] and interacting proteins often display similar evolutionary histories 38, 39 (Box 2\n).Box 2Criteria for including or rejecting candidate BH3 proteinsDefinitive bioinformatic procedures that reliably predict new BH3-containing proteins are currently lacking (Box 1) and new, improved methods are needed. Although previously reported BH3 search strategies potentially narrow the list of candidates somewhat, there is little certainty of this. Similar issues plague our ability to accurately predict microRNA targets [62]. Even with improved bioinformatics, additional criteria are needed to avoid logical contradictions and false positives. Using Bid-like proteins as an example, it is reasonable to consider inclusion of proteins with Bcl-2-like 3D structures even in the absence of recognizable BH motifs [63]. Structural determinations and evidence for direct interactions of putative BH3 peptides with confirmed Bcl-2-homologous proteins using fluorescence polarization, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or surface plasmon resonance have been applied to confirm new BH3 motifs, in addition to cell-based evidence to validate biochemical studies [64]. BH3 candidacy would also be supported by functional conservation in closely related species and by the pairing of a BH3 candidate with its target Bcl-2 family member in the same species or perhaps with an invading intracellular pathogen. In the absence of a host\u2013parasite relationship, candidate BH3-only proteins encoded by non-metazoan species lacking Bcl-2 homologues or true mitochondria are difficult to justify (Box 3). There are potentially many clinically relevant peptides and small molecules that fit into the hydrophobic pockets of various Bcl-2 family proteins and mimic natural ligands. Although not derived from a natural protein, the case can be made to include peptides selected from an artificial library as bona fide BH3 motifs [65], with the potential appellation of \u2018BH3-like\u2019, \u2018BH3-mimetic\u2019, or \u2018BH3 functional analog\u2019.",

            "text": "It is intriguing that mammalian Bcl-2 family proteins can inhibit (e.g., Bcl-xL) or induce (e.g., Bax) cell death when expressed separately in cells from multiple kingdoms, including yeast and other species lacking Bcl-2 homologs 40, 41, 42, 43. This could conceivably reflect conservation of function if mammalian Bcl-2 family proteins interface with highly conserved cellular machinery. Consistent with this model, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 were recently reported to interact with the highly conserved mitochondrial ATP synthase 44, 45. One potential implication would be that yeast and bacteria encode as yet unrecognized Bcl-2-shaped proteins explaining why they maintain the ability to interact with mammalian Bcl-2 proteins. Pursuit of these answers is seriously compromised until such putative Bcl-2-like proteins are identified in non-metazoans, and there are equally valid alternative explanations that do not evoke conservation of function. Ectopically expressed mammalian Bcl-2 proteins may use different mechanisms to modulate cell survival/death in yeast by acting on distinct effector proteins. Alternatively, Bcl-2 proteins could act on lipid membranes, such as changing membrane curvature in a manner that does not require specific interactions with foreign proteins. Experimental investigation of yeast is likely to provide tremendous insight into many different cell-death mechanisms and may even reveal as yet unknown mechanisms of mammalian Bcl-2 proteins 46, 47. However, the epistemic goal in this case would be different: to uncover the mechanisms of action of Bcl-2 family proteins, which is fundamentally different from establishing phylogenetic inferences (Box 3\n).Box 3Do yeasts have BH3-only proteins?One case in point is the candidate yeast BH3 protein Ybh3/Bxi1 (YNL305C) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a member of the BI-1 protein family predicted with high confidence to be a multimembrane-spanning protein 66, 67, 68. The reported assignment of a BH3 motif to yeast Ybh3 was made by visual inspection and the multiple alignment reveals only two fully conserved residues (Leu and Asp) followed by a less conserved amino acid (Asp or Glu). Using the sequence L-X(4)-D-[DE] to search against the proteome of S. cerevisiae yields 2575 hits (in 1834 sequences) and the more stringent pattern [LTYIE]-X-[EQARS]-X-L-[KQRA]-X(3)-D-[EKDS] derived from the reported alignment yields 160 matches (in 156 proteins). This candidate yeast BH3 sequence is also somewhat truncated because it is located at the C terminus of the Ybh3 protein and overlaps one of six transmembrane segments, two unprecedented features among BH3-containing proteins. Furthermore, the putative BH3 sequence lacks conservation in orthologous proteins, potentially challenging its functional importance. Although this BH3 was reported to bind Bcl-xL and to promote yeast cell death, two other studies have reported that this yeast gene is pro-survival, not pro-death, consistent with BI-1 function in other species 67, 68, 69. More perplexing is how this yeast protein might ever encounter human Bcl-xL. Still it is conceivable that non-metazoan species will be found to encode proteins that closely resemble the 3D structure of Bcl-2 family proteins to serve as a potential target of this yeast BH3 [70]. Nevertheless, currently available tools to define BH3 motifs in non-metazoans suggest that Ybh3 is just as likely to reflect a fortuitous event, although this does not negate its utility in research if it binds tightly and specifically to the cleft of Bcl-2.",

A three-level color coding system indicates BH type (see color key) and predictability: (i) BH motifs predicted by InterProScan (see color key, meaning BH is predicted); (ii) BH motifs that appear in the NCBI entry for this protein (light shades, meaning BH can be uncertain due to automatic annotation); and (iii) BH motifs not predicted or annotated as above, but nonetheless reported with experimental evidence (colored circles). Transmembrane (TM) segments predicted by one (light gray) or both (dark gray) TMHMM Server v. 2.0 and Phobius web server 51, 52. Total amino acid (aa) number is indicated for proteins not drawn to scale. Abbreviations for non-human proteins: Ce, Caenorhabditis elegans; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; Mm, Mus musculus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; Pl, Photorhabdus luminescens; Sp, Schizosaccharomyces pombe; SARS-CoV, human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Number of BH motif hits (right): the number of times a BH motif is predicted to occur within each protein based on the following searches (>1 denotes ambiguity). Predefined amino acid sequence signatures from InterPro (IPR) [53], from published patterns talis qualis (tq), and from patterns inferred from these publications additum (ad) were used to search the indicated protein and the number of exact matches to the following sequences is reported (shaded cells; unshaded cells had no hits): IPR003093 for BH4; IPR020731 for BH4 is from the PROSITE pattern PS01260 ([DS]-[NT]-R-[AE]-[LI]-V-X-[KD]-[FY]-[LIV]-[GHS]-Y-K-L-[SR]-Q-[RK]-G-[HY]-X-[CW]); 6-mer BH4 tq ([ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-X2-[FYWH]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]) [18]; 6-mer BH3 ad ([ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKTE]-X2-[FYWHL]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]); IPR020728 BH3 is from PS01259 ([LIVAT]-X3-L-[KARQ]-X-[IVAL]-G-D-[DESG]-[LIMFV]-[DENSHQ]-[LVSHRQ]-[NSR]); 7-mer BH3 (L-X3-G-D-E); 9-mer BH3 ([LM]-[ERAKQL]-[RAQICEY]-[MILAFSE]-[ASG]-D-[DEQKGR]-[LFMIVD]-[NDVHSEQA]) [54]; 12-mer BH3 tq ([ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-X3-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[KR]-X2-[AGS]-[DE]-X-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]) [55]; 12-mer BH3 ad ([ILVCAGMFYWHKTE]-X3-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[KRAQL]-X2-[AGS]-[DE]-X-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]); 13-mer BH3 tq ([ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[AGS]-X2-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-X2-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[AGS]-D-[ED]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[NHDY]) [56]; 13-mer BH3 ad ([ILVCAGMFYWHKTE]-[AGSC]-X2-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-X2-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[AGS]-D-[EDKQL]-[ILVCAGMFYWHKT]-[NHDYE]); IPR020717 BH1 from PS01080: [LVMENQ]-[FTLS]-X-[GSDECQ]-[GLPCKH]-X1/2-[NST]-[YW]-G-[RK]-[LIV]-[LIVC]-[GAT]-[LIVMF](2)-X-F-[GSAEC]-[GSARY]); and IPR020726 BH2 from PS01258 (W-[LIM]-X3-[GR]-G-[WQ]-[DENSAV]-X-[FLGA]-[LIVFTC]) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).",
