For example, infection of susceptible mice with Abelson murine leukemia virus and other retroviral constructs hastens the development of plasma cell neoplasia.66 In human MRD patients, most have no definable etiology.

Polyclonal globulin increases are associated with reactive or inflammatory plasma cell disorders and these patients are generally not considered to have a MRD. Monoclonal proteins (also known as M-proteins or myeloma proteins and a subset of the paraproteins) are Igs typically of normal structure and charge but present in excessive quantity, and they are a hallmark of MRD.85 Standard high-resolution agarose gel SPE has been reported to identify a monoclonal protein in 82% of human patients with MM.86 However, low levels of monoclonal protein can be concealed within the beta or gamma regions of a routine SPE trace. Over time electrophoretic tests have improved (e.g., capillary zone electrophoresis). Furthermore, a combination of tests are used to increase the diagnostic accuracy for PCD.87 Serum protein electrophoresis will detect monoclonal levels as low as 500 mg/L, immunofixation as low as 150 mg/L, but the latest nephelometric immunoassays for serum immunoglobulin free light chains (SFLC) are capable of detecting less than 1 mg/L. Quantification of SFLC is now recommended in all human MRD patients for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring.88 Note that even where standard electrophoresis methodologies do detect a quantitative abnormality, they cannot always reliably identify a monoclonal protein and differentiate it from, for example, a restricted oligoclonal gammopathy. Therefore, immunofixation electrophoresis is used as the confirmatory gold standard test for the presence of a monoclonal protein and to distinguish its heavy and light chain type. A 24-hour urine collection for urine protein electrophoresis, protein quantification, and immunofixation are additional tests frequently used in the investigation of monoclonal gammopathies in humans.89\n",

Progressive morphologic changes within plasma cells (with ultimately the development of plasmablastic features) have clearly been correlated with accumulating cytogenetic aberrations and progressive clinical disease.101, 102 Yet these morphologic changes do not take place uniformly. Diverse populations of plasma cell morphology may be seen within a single biopsy. Therefore, a provisional diagnosis of a MRD is achieved through synthesis of multiple observations including lesional and perilesional tissue and cellular changes, density of plasma cells, as well as the above plasma cell morphological features and the relative proportions between these cells. In soft tissues, the presence of mass-related changes allows greater confidence in the provisional diagnosis. Within bone marrow, although near complete effacement of the marrow cavity by plasma cells is occasionally observed, it is more common to see varying degrees of plasma cell density and a cut off of 10% or greater infiltration is required for diagnosis.103\n",

Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry allow the surrogate demonstration of clonality when expression of a single Ig light chain only is revealed, and this is the most common technique in veterinary medicine. Alternative techniques include flow cytometry, molecular biological tests such as polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot, and an array of cytogenetic and epigenetic tests.89, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108 In practical terms, the confirmed presence of IA can also be used as a surrogate marker of clonality, but there should be an awareness that in rare patients there may be discordant results.109, 110\n",

However, the importance of clonal confirmation in the tissue of interest in cases of feline MRD has been reported. In one study, 34 histopathological samples with an original diagnosis of MRD made by a diversity of board-certified pathologists in various institutions and laboratories were subjected to review by an independent panel of board-certified pathologists who examined H&E stained sections along with additional histochemical and immunohistochemical stained sections. Only 56% (n = 19) of the cases were eventually shown to be clonal MRD by light chain restriction.64 Some of the excluded feline cases were not of B cell origin despite a plasmacytoid appearance (instead proving to be histiocytic neoplasms or mast cell tumors). Cellular morphology is linked to function, and other non-B lymphoid cells that have high demand for protein production (e.g., not Ig) may have a plasmacytoid appearance. Further examples include plasmacytoid dendritic cells, histiocytes, salivary gland duct luminal cells, and myoepithelial cells.110, 111, 112, 113, 114\n",

This occurs through both the direct cellular toxic effect of amyloid precursors, as well as damage to organ structure and function via massive deposition of amyloid fibrils in extracellular spaces. Biopsies must show amyloid deposition confirmed by Congo-red staining and apple-green birefringence under polarizing light microscopy. The amyloid must then be typed, which historically has been achieved through histochemical assessment or immunohistochemistry, although more recently it has been supplanted by laser microdissection with mass spectrometry (LMD/MS).117 Typing allows precise categorization of the amyloid. Numerous amyloidogenic proteins have been discovered, but only a single group is relevant to the MRD\u2014the IA.118 Historically, IA diseases have largely been considered separately from MRD. Even in recent times, IA is described by some authors as a nonproliferative and nonneoplastic PCD.119 However, current work confirms shared aspects of pathogenesis in terms of the underlying cytogenetic aberrations, as well as outcomes in subsets of human patients, with the suggestion that IA be considered as low-proliferative, neoplastic MRD.120, 121\n",

However, there has been some confusion in earlier literature regarding the diagnostic criteria of MM in cats. For example, cats have been reported as having MM despite pathological evidence of the absence of bone marrow infiltration, and instead having extramedullary involvement.36, 46 In general, across the feline literature, given the historical diagnostic criteria, there will likely have been a tendency to a reporting bias towards MM cases that involved radiographic bone lesions. Examining the literature prior to 2005, 75 cases of all types of MRD had been described, of which 36 provided clinical details of investigations (mainly in the form of case reports or small case series). Of these, 22 cases were explicitly described as MM, of which only 6 (27%) had radiographically evident bone lesions\u2014a notably low proportion in comparison to humans\u2014in whom 80% of MM cases have radiographically detectable osteolysis.136 Then in 2005, two larger clinical case series of MM were published. In one series from a single institution, 58.3% of MM cases had radiographically evident bone lesions.48 In another series from a single veterinary practice with an orthopedic bias, the proportion was 71.4%.26 However, in 2006, in a multi-departmental, multicenter clinical case series, the authors proposed that feline MRD cases infrequently (8%) present with radiographic bone lesions, with some additional statistical support for this hypothesis.1 The conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the retrospective nature of all of these studies, the failure to obtain complete skeletal survey radiographs in all cases, and the imperfect comparisons made. However, given the pre-existing literature and the authors' findings, it is probable that fewer feline MRD cases have classical radiographically detectable osteolysis compared to human patients.",

Patients thought to be affected with SPB have instead been reclassified as MM through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) discovery of additional bone lesions not apparent on standard skeletal radiographic survey.145 Current diagnostic criteria for SBP are given in Table 55-2.

Indeed in humans, there are additional disorders involving plasma cell pathology and gammopathies that have yet to be described in the feline literature. In the past two decades, there has been a move to classify human patients into a new category: \u201cSymptomatic Multiple Myeloma.\u201d This new diagnosis accommodates patients with either intramedullary or extramedullary disease, or both (see Table 55-2). Symptomatic multiple myeloma also accords significance to whether patients are displaying signs of myeloma-related end organ damage. There may be value in recategorizing MRDs in veterinary medicine, employing a system that potentially facilitates greater consistency in diagnostic investigation and classification. The proposed system retains a central role for pathological diagnosis, but with an altered, more patient-centric focus explicitly incorporating a broader range of myeloma-related clinical problems. A system that incorporates other lymphoproliferative disorders into MRD when they have protein-related functional disorders (e.g., lymphoma patients producing a monoclonal protein, or patients with IA or MIDD). Ultimately, this system is a combined diagnosis and risk stratification system. This last point in particular is of assistance when there are indistinct boundaries between traditional MRD diagnostic categories which may be observed in patients of any species. Patients may be asymptomatic with low cellular proliferation (benign monoclonal gammopathy at time of death), clinically affected with low cellular proliferation (immunoglobulin amyloidosis), or clinically affected with high cellular proliferation (multiple myeloma). Furthermore, clonal plasma cells can show widely varying biological behavior within the same patient over the course of a lifetime.",

In the event of patient death due to unrelated causes, these conditions may never have progressed to displaying neoplastic behavior (in terms of evident pathological damage or clinical relevant problems attributable to a MRD).

Statistically significant survival benefit for selected cats receiving surgery has been demonstrated when compared to cats that received no therapy or glucocorticoids alone.1, 64 A variety of surgical therapies including cutaneous mass excision, splenectomy, and enucleation have been reported across the feline literature, and generally positive responses have been documented in appropriately selected cases. For example, in a typical clinical decision-making process, a solitary plasmacytoma of the spleen might be suspected on the basis of a discovered serum/urine monoclonal protein along with sonographic evidence for splenic structural changes, cytopathological indications of well differentiated plasma cells, and no radiographic evidence for bone lesions (based on a complete skeletal survey). Further testing could include additional splenic aspirates for immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements as well as further imaging (e.g., MRI or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans and concurrent bone marrow aspirate and trephine). If there are no further involved sites identified, then splenectomy would follow. This paradigm follows the current best evidence in human patients\u2014that truly localized EMP at accessible sites should be completely surgically excised.79 However, in areas of poor surgical access (e.g., the upper respiratory or digestive tract), radiotherapy alone is the treatment of choice.79 Solitary visceral organs that are diffusely infiltrated and cannot be safely excised or irradiated (e.g., hepatic plasmacytoma with diffuse hepatic infiltration) may be treated with chemotherapy as per other myeloma cases (see Multifocal Lesions).",
