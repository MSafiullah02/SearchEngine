National surveillance in Japan during the 2015\u20132016 season reported that H1N1pdm09 accounted for 86% of cases of influenza A virus infection [9]. Although the clinical features of pediatric patients with H1N1pdm09 in the 2009 season have been documented, clinical information regarding H1N1pdm09 infections in other seasons is relatively scarce. In general, we hypothesize that influenza pandemics tend to be more severe than seasonal outbreaks due to the lack of host immunity. However, risk factors for developing severe complications during a pandemic might differ from those in seasonal outbreaks due to differences in host immunity or genetic changes in the circulating strain. These questions require further research to be answered.",

Total nucleic acids were extracted from specimens, which were additionally taken from endotracheal tube aspirates, from all patients who had PB using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the Fast-track Diagnostics respiratory pathogens 21 (FTDRP21) multiplex assay kit (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg).

Genome sequencing for the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes was performed using specific primers (Supplemental table: Table S1). The determined sequences are available from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database under the accession numbers LC270874 to LC270885. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software [13]. The other sequences analyzed for phylogenetic trees were obtained from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data [14].",

Six patients received the diagnosis of PB and required mechanical ventilation, while among these three also required ECMO for pulmonary support. Table 2\nshows the details of these cases. Major underlying conditions in the cases with PB were asthma (n = 5, 83%) and food allergy (n = 3, 50%). Among the patients with asthma, two had moderate persistent asthma and were using inhaled corticosteroid as a controller, and three patients had intermittent asthma which did not require a controller.

We also performed full genome sequencing for two specimens obtained from the patient 2 and 5 who required ECMO. The sequence data for the NA gene revealed that patient 2 was infected with the oseltamivir-resistant H275Y mutant virus from the specimen taken before the treatment of neuraminidase inhibitor. Although patient 2 was treated with peramivir, the duration of intubation and hospitalization was similar to that in patients infected by the non-resistant strain. No other known relevant mutations were identified in the analysis in patient 2 and 5.",

Similarly, in our study, development of the severest form of respiratory failure, PB, due to H1N1pdm09, was associated with an underlying allergic disease such as asthma. Interestingly, the severity of asthma ranged from intermittent to moderate persistent, suggesting that the risk of PB development may not depend on the severity of asthma. This lack of association between the severity of the underlying asthma and the severity of LRI due to H1N1pdm09 infection was also observed in the 2009 season [17]. Thus the recognition of asthma as a risk factor for severe H1N1pdm09 infection appears to apply to the 2015\u20132016 season.",

The high affinity of H1N1pdm09 to the lower respiratory tract has been reported in animal models and suggests the existence of specific virulence factors accountable for host-pathogen interactions [21]. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes from all cases of PB observed in this study showed that these genes belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2, which were the commonest circulating strains during the 2015-16 season [9]. We also performed full genome sequencing for two specimens obtained from the patient 2 and 5 who required ECMO, without finding any variations known to be associated with virulence. Although limited, these data suggested that the patients' host factors, rather than a viral factor peculiar to these severe cases, were more important for developing severe respiratory failure.",

A previous report suggested that a delay in administering antiviral drugs might be associated with increased severity [22]. However, PB in most of our patients progressed rapidly within one day of onset, making early antiviral therapy difficult. The median time from onset of fever to admission was two days, the time-frame within which 76% of the patients were admitted. Therefore, our findings may support the importance of immunization in the prevention of severe influenza. Although our study was not designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, previous reports have shown a vaccine efficacy rate of 61%\u201363% against A(H1N1)pdm09 and prevention of hospitalization in 76% of cases [8], [23]. The rate of immunization was four in 21 (19%) in the admitted patients and one in six (17%) in PB, which was lower than the general immunization rate of 50% in Japan [24]. Thus, our findings support the current recommendations to vaccinate children.",

However, because national surveillance in Japan revealed that 86% of influenza A infections in the 2015\u20132016 season were due to H1N1pdm09, we assumed that the majority of our patients in whom influenza A infection was diagnosed might also have an H1N1pdm09 infection. This would compromised the comparison of the PB and non-PB groups. Second, the number of cases was small to perform a statistical analysis, possibly leading as a result to an underestimation of the effects of other potential risk factors.
