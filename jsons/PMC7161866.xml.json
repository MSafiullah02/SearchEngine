Initially, live viruses were used through inoculation, i.e., subcutaneous administration of liquid taken from a pustule of a person showing mild symptoms into a healthy person to confer immune protection against the viral pathogen [3]. The term variolation refers solely to the inoculation with smallpox virus (from the Latin name of the virus \u201cvariola\u201d). However, inoculation had its attendant risks: the recipients could develop the disease and spread it to others. Additionally the transmission of other diseases via bloodborne route, such as syphilis, was also a concern [2]. At the end of the 18th century, cowpox live viruses (the variant affecting cows) were inoculated in humans to protect against smallpox, the human variant. This procedure was called vaccination, the word is derived from the Latin vacca, meaning cow.\n",

The expression of antigenic proteins from its cDNA was now possible, resulting in the production of large amounts of highly pure antigens and thus, providing more doses. For example, if the first hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine was manufactured by purifying the plasma of infected patients, nowadays recombinant HBV vaccines are produced in CHO cells through genetic cell line development [9]. Advances in animal cell culture technology introduced novel cell lines, improving the production bioprocess by allowing scale up in suspension cultures and providing more competitive yields.",

            "text": "Currently, the toolbox for vaccine development is quite vast. The deeper comprehension of our immune system together with the remarkable technological innovations led to the design of a myriad of different viral vaccines (e.g. DNA vaccines, chimeric or hybrid viral particles, vectored vaccines, replication\u2010defective viruses, antigens obtained through DNA shuffling of different viral strains) (Fig. 1). Despite the technological progress and the promising prospects of disease control by vaccination, several challenges still stand. For many diseases there are no vaccines available and novel viruses are sure to emerge. If available, vaccines may not be 100% effective in preventing the disease, or their supply may still be insufficient, or their costs may be too high for worldwide distribution, particularly in developing countries [8]. For instance, traditional manufacturing methods for influenza vaccines are not able to rapidly respond to a pandemia. The use of eggs to propagate the virus is one of the bottlenecks, posing manufacturing problems that occasionally result in distribution delays and, in the case of a pandemia, the required number of quality fertile eggs and the capacity to process them, are unlikely to match worldwide needs [12]. Additionally, there is a growing demand for improved vaccine safety, fueled by the manufacturing requirements recommended by the regulatory entities (e.g. FDA or EMA) and by antivaccination groups [8]. Indeed some technologies are outdated and pose safety issues in already licensed vaccines [1]. For example, paralysis side effects were observed after oral vaccination against poliovirus [13] and disseminated infection after Bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination [14]. Hence, some of the older vaccines, or their manufacturing processes, need to be re\u2010examined and re\u2010addressed. Indeed, vaccines have been continuously evolving with the technology in order to provide: safer means of immune protection to the patients and reduce possible side effects. The newer molecular technologies can play a role in this demand improving the safety profile of a vaccine both through its design and manufacturing process. For example, recombinant vaccines can be designed to minimize or eliminate virulence reversion, a potential threat of traditional attenuated vaccines. In what concerns manufacturing, the production and purification processes should also be carefully established. At this level, one particular concern is the use and choice of the cell substrate used for viral vaccines production. A thorough characterization of cell substrates is essential to establish quality control systems that allow, for example, confirming that the final product is not contaminated with adventitious agents, oncogenic proteins or DNA from the host cell. Additionally, increasing efforts are being placed in the optimization of animal cell substrates to improve the production capacity and reducing the costs, aiming at worldwide distribution.",

Although inoculation procedures are still used in veterinary vaccination, for human use this is no longer the case. The only type of live viruses used for human vaccination are live attenuated (licensed) or vectored vaccines (under clinical development). There are several approaches to attenuate viruses. One of the most used procedures involves growing the viruses in foreign hosts, as animal cell cultures, where they replicate poorly. Several vaccines have been developed using this procedure including poliovirus, measles or rubella vaccines [8]. Today, live attenuated vaccines can be obtained through additional molecular strategies such as: reassortment (e.g. influenza and rotavirus) [16], mutation or deletion of viral genes (e.g. dengue virus) [17], or codon deoptimization (e.g. poliovirus) [18]. One concern related with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility of reversion into a virulent form, as seen for the first polio oral vaccine. In this context, inactivated vaccines provide safer alternatives to attenuated vaccines.",

Several inactivated viral vaccines are commercially available against, for example, influenza, rabies or poliovirus (Table 1). In addition to presenting a safer profile comparatively to attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated vaccines are also more stable. Although inactivated vaccines are quite effective for some pathogens, for others, they do not induce an effective and/or long\u2010lasting immunity since they do not give rise to cytotoxic T cells immune response, which is important to efficiently fight intracellular pathogens as viruses. Because of that, multiple doses and adjuvants are often used [19].",

These vaccines use immunodominant antigens, specific parts of the virus (full proteins or peptides) known to stimulate the generation of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). Subunit viral vaccines are a further development of inactivated viral vaccines but instead of generating antibodies against all of the pathogen antigens, only one or just a few antigens are used. The real challenge in the development of subunit vaccines is to identify which antigens induce protective immunity [20]. Examples of subunit viral vaccines available are the hepatitis B vaccine (e.g. GSK's Engerix\u00ae or Merck's RecombivaxHB\u00ae) or the recently approved influenza vaccine Flublok\u00ae (Protein Sciences). The subunit vaccines for hepatitis B are produced by recombinant technology using either yeast or CHO cells [9, 21]. The Flublok\u00ae vaccine is a recombinant trivalent hemagglutinin (rHA) vaccine produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system [22]. Similarly to inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines are stable and are considered safer than live attenuated vaccines. Their main disadvantage is the lower immune response elicited, when compared to live attenuated, requiring co\u2010administration of adjuvants and often multiple doses [15].",

Additionally, the VLPs structure favors its uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) essential to elicit long\u2010lasting immune protection [11]. APCs display the foreign antigens complexed with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces.

In non\u2010enveloped VLPs heterologous antigen presentation can be achieved through molecular fusion or chemical conjugation. [33, 34]. Fueled by the existence of an already licensed HBV vaccine, HBV\u2010based chimeric VLPs are one of the most used scaffolds for protein or peptide display. The engraftment of foreign sequences into HBV capsid protein can however, interfere with correct VLP assembly [35, 36]. A solution to maintain the VLP integrity is to combine two different proteins in hybrid VLPs. Strong and broad immune responses were generated using hybrid VLPs composed of L1 and L2 proteins from HPV and different HIV glycoproteins [37, 38].",

The most common examples of pseudotyping in vaccine development are the use of HCV or HIV envelopes to pseudotype murine leukeamia virus (MLV)\u2010derived VLPs [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Pseudotyping can also generate bivalent vaccine candidates when glycoproteins from different virus are incorporated in the same envelope, as Newcastle disease virus and influenza A virus [46], or rabies virus and ebolavirus [47]. Whole heterologous antigen presentation is also being explored as strategy to maintain structural authenticity of target antigens and thus, to meet quality criteria otherwise difficult to achieve when expressing the isolated target antigen. Indeed, expressing the HIV envelope proteins gp120 individually hinders the natural conformational arrangement into trimers, hampering its correct presentation. It has been shown that monomeric gp120 subunits fail to induce broad NAbs and do not prevent infection [48]. Conversely, Hammonds et al. demonstrated, in guinea pig models, enhanced neutralizing antibody response elicited by HIV VLPs when compared to the same HIV isolate subunit protein [49].",

A myriad of viral vectors are available based on adenovirus, poxvirus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, alphaviruses, or adeno\u2010associated virus. Adenoviruses have been perhaps the most used vaccine vector. Adenoviruses are easily produced in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) or PER.C6\u00ae cells to high titers and express the transgene(s) to high levels activating the innate immune system and stimulating dendritic cell maturation [68]. Several candidate vaccines against HIV use adenovirus. Adenovirus type 5 vaccines expressing individual antigens of HIV such as the envelope protein or Gag were shown to induce CD8+ T cell responses. The clinical study from Merck evaluating recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vectors expressing clade B Gag, Pol, and Nef in high\u2010risk individuals terminated however unsuccessfully. But yet another clinical trial provided the first signal of an HIV vaccine efficacy. In the latter a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine, ALVAC\u2010HIV, was evaluated on a prime envelope gp120 protein boost regimen and it demonstrated a 31% protective effect against acquisition of HIV infection in low\u2010risk subjects [69].",

It would also have several advantages over currently available seasonal vaccines, requiring less frequent administration, ideally just one [77]. The development of universal vaccines relies on the utilization of highly conserved antigenic targets. The main difficulty lies on accessibility to conserved antigenic epitopes since these are usually less exposed and are generally weak immunogens. Therefore, in a universal vaccine the immunogenicity of the identified conserved antigens has to be increased to induce protective immunity. In the case of Influenza virus several promising candidate antigens have been proposed, including the hemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein (M1 and M2e), nucleoprotein and neuraminidase (NA) proteins (for an extensive revision see [77]).",

The approval of Vero cell line for vaccine manufacture was a landmark as it opened an important precedent in the use of cell substrates by initiating the transition of cell strains to cell lines. It was also during those years that the use of tumorigenic cell lines for the production of vaccines against emerging viral pathogens started to be discussed. In the beginning of the 21st century, the first tumorigenic cell line was introduced in the production of a live viral vaccine. PER.C6\u00ae, a proprietary cell line from Crucell, was designed for the production of a replication\u2010defective adenovirus vectored HIV vaccine.

E1\u2010only transcomplementing \u201cdesigner cell lines\u201d appeared then to respond to the need of safer cell lines than HEK 293 (Table 2).

PER.C6\u00ae are human embryonic retinoblasts (HER) cells, transformed with Ad5 sequence 459 to 3510, comprising the E1A and E1B encoding sequences only. In addition E1A and E1B are under control of the human PGK promoter (that compensate for the removal of the 5' endogenous E1A promoter) [99]. A few years later, other E1\u2010transcomplementing, or 'designer', cell lines from HeLa cells [100] and human aminocytes [101] were established, to further reduce sequence homology, between E1 immortalizing DNA (integrated in the cells genome) and vectored vaccine viral genome, reducing the possibility of double homologous recombination and generation of RCAs. The cells derived from human aminocytes are the proprietary cell line CAP\u00ae (Cevec). Further details on the history of E1\u2010transcomplementing cell lines have been reviewed in [102].",

These particles assemble at the cellular membranes, naturally incorporating several host cell proteins including, and to a large extent, CD81 [118].

For instance, Novartis already uses MDCK for the production of Optaflu\u00ae (or Flucelvax\u00ae), although maintaining the production of the oldest version, Fluvirin\u00ae which uses the traditional embryonated eggs manufacture process. New designs for old vaccines are also being pursued. Protein Sciences used insect cells for the production of Flublok\u00ae, exclusively based on protein (HA), the first vaccine for seasonal flu that avoids the use of replication\u2010competent influenza virus. The introduction of novel vaccine designs and cell lines should face less resistance in the case of diseases for which no vaccines or treatment are available, particularly those that are life threatening (or severely debilitating).",

In the middle of the 20th century animal cell culture became a standard procedure to grow virus allowing the development of attenuated (AV) and inactivated (IV) vaccines. In the late 20th century the DNA recombinant technologies allowed to develop subunit vaccines based on presenting protein antigens (P and VLPs), coding for the antigens (DNA and vectored vaccines) or both. Further advances on genetic engineering originated a myriad of different vaccine designs such as chimeric vaccines still under development but holding great expectations.",

(A) Conceptually, cell line development encloses all the steps leading to a clonal culture with extended life\u2010span. At the end of development, some of the cell lines already support viral propagation (e.g. influenza virus propagates in MDCK, Vero, HEK293, etc). Spontaneous immortalization is usually based on chromosomal rearrangements \u2013 not externally induced \u2013 resulting in the loss of senescence\u2010related and/or activation of immortalizing genes; cell line development without external genetic manipulation is called simple cell line establishment. Induced immortalization can rely on chemical or physical agents (e.g. methylcholanthrene or UV) or on the integration of immortalizing genes (telomerase, SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1 genes, etc.). Depending on the immortalizing gene, the cell lines can also support the propagation of partially deleted viral vectors (such as HEK293 or PER.C6, immortalized with human adenovirus E1 gene being denominated as transcomplementing cell lines for E1\u2010deleted adenovirus). Cell line development also encloses genetic manipulation specifically conceived to support the production of a particular virus or viral components, resulting in stable (or inducible) cells lines that constitutively (or upon induction) express the viral components [33]. (B) Finally, cell line engineering can be defined as a genetic manipulation designed to improve the production performance of a pre\u2010existing cell line, mostly for increasing specific titers. Strategies to facilitate the production process or to provide the produced particles with specific traits can also be categorized as cell line engineering.",
