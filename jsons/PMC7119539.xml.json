            "text": "The genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae consists of four approved species: Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Border disease virus (BDV); and other related viruses such as atypical bovine pestiviruses that have not been assigned to species (Pletnev et al., 2011). The pestiviral genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule with a standard size of approximately 12.5 kb (Colett et al., 1988, Deng and Brock, 1992). The genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Following translation, the ORF is processed into 11 mature proteins, namely N-terminal protease (Npro), capsid protein (C), three glycoproteins (E1, E2, Erns), protein of 7 kDa (p7) and five non-structural proteins (NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) (Thiel et al., 1996). Glycoprotein E2 is immunodominant in eliciting antibody response to virus infection whereas glycoprotein Erns and non-structural protein NS3 participate in immune response (Corapi et al., 1990). NS3 is conserved antigenically whereas Erns shows less antigenic diversity than E2 (Fulton et al., 2003). Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the atypical bovine pestiviruses are related more closely to the recognized bovine pestivirus species BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 than to any other pestivirus species (Liu et al., 2009c, Liu et al., 2010, Decaro et al., 2011).",

An atypical pestivirus D32/00_\u2018HoBi\u2019 was first detected in a batch of fetal calf serum of Brazilian origin (Schirrmeier et al., 2004) and subsequently similar viruses were detected in batches of fetal bovine serum (FBS) of different origin (Peletto et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2009b, Xia et al., 2011). Recent experiments revealed that the atypical bovine pestiviruses may cause clinical signs of the disease similar to those caused by BVDV-1 (Larska et al., 2012, Decaro et al., 2012b). Although an atypical pestivirus strain Th/04_KhonKaen was found to cause subclinical infection (St\u00e5hl et al., 2007, Kampa et al., 2009), another atypical pestivirus was associated with an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in Italy (Decaro et al., 2011). The latter agent was detected subsequently in aborted fetuses (Decaro et al., 2012a), which is a reminiscent of a previous report (Cortez et al., 2006).",

In indirect detection methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used widely for monitoring herd seroprevalence. As an alternative, a microsphere-based immunoassay has been developed (Xia et al., 2010). This assay is based on the Luminex xMAP technology and it detects NS3 antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity (Xia et al., 2010). Anderson et al. (2011) reported a Luminex multiplex serology assay for the detection of antibodies to four different bovine viruses, namely, bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza 3 virus (PI3V), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and BVDV. In that multiplex assay the use of the recombinant BVDV E2 protein as a potent antigen led to an increase in signal strength.",

However, blocking with PBS containing 5% milk in the immunoassay created certain technical problems: it clogged the needle in the Luminex analyzer such that the probe had to be cleaned four or five times during analysis. The microspheres were also likely to be aggregated and covered by the milk, and were lost during washing steps. Therefore, it took the analyzer longer time to count 100 beads per sample and the test could fail completely. The PBS containing 1% BSA worked well for some samples but high MFI values were also observed in several negative samples. As the microspheres itself gave neglect MFI values, it is likely that even in the purified protein there were still some impurities that caused the unspecific binding to bovine antibodies. To reduce the unspecific binding, sera were incubated with Sf9 cell lysate before being tested in the immunoassay, which brought down MFI values for the negative samples whereas the MFI values for the positive samples were not affected. Cell lysate has been used to reduce unspecific binding in a Luminex serological assay (Waterboer et al., 2006).",

Both results matched 100%. Two serum samples, which had been tested negative by ELISA but positive by a blocking microsphere immunoassay targeting NS3 antibodies (Xia et al., 2010), remained negative in this Erns immunoassay. It seemed likely that the two serum samples were either truly negative or very weak positive that was only detected by the blocking immunoassay. While 15 serum samples from all three infected groups were tested positive, a slight difference in the MFI values was observed. The highest MFI value (average) was 21,956 for the sera against atypical pestivirus, where the viral Erns protein was the antigen; the lowest MFI value (average) was 17,818 for the BVDV-1 sera that were heterologous to the antigen; and 20,471 for the sera of the mixed infection. Interestingly, when the Erns protein was replaced by that of BVDV-1 strain CP7, the average MFI values of these three groups changed, with the highest (22,915) for the homologous sera (BVDV-1) and the lowest (17,425) for the heterologous sera (atypical pestivirus) and middle value (20,715) for the mixed infection. More studies are needed in order to investigate whether this correlation is consistent or it is just a coincidence. Furthermore, the immunoassay could be expanded readily for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against multiple bovine viruses in the Bovine Respiratory and Enteric Disease (BRD and BED, respectively) complexes, such as bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus.",

The Erns microsphere immunoassay was able to detect antibodies against bovine viral diarrhea viruses with performance similar to commercial ELISAs. Thus, the microsphere immunoassay, using the recombinant Erns protein of an atypical bovine pestivirus, offers a powerful novel alternative to the current diagnostic methods for bovine viral diarrhea and related diseases. This microsphere immunoassay platform opens new possibilities for the rapid and complex diagnosis of respiratory and enteric diseases, with great multiplexing potential and flexibility.",
