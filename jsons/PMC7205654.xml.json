On the 21st February 2020, the total of cases identified by the health authorities in Lombardy was 34 (Lombardy Region, 2020). This prompted the Government to declare the area of the outbreak \u201cred zone\u201d, progressively limiting travel, social, cultural and economic activities of >50,000 people (DPCM, 2020a; IMH, 2020a). Due to the rapid rise of infections, on the 23rd February 2020, a new ordinance from the authorities resulted in the closure of all schools and placed restrictions on social and economic activities throughout the Lombardy region (IMH, 2020b).",

The chosen period for the PL is from the 9th to 22nd of March 2020, when schools and universities were completely closed and movements in a large part of northern Italy were limited only to strictly essential needs and to reach the workplace (DPCM, 2020b, DPCM, 2020d).

January was not considered suitable for the identification of the reference period due to the high relative humidity, and low average temperatures (Table S3), different conditions than PL and TL which would have led to an imbalance in the comparison of some polluting agent trends (e.g. PM10 and SO2) due to the massive use of heating systems (Barrington-Leigh et al., 2019; Pillarisetti et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 3, in February temperature, relative humidity, wind, precipitation and average solar irradiance in the daylight hours were similar to those of March. Therefore, the CTRL period was chosen in the first part of February (from 7 to 20) next to the closing time of schools and universities and exhibiting comparable meteorological conditions with PL and TL (Table S4). Furthermore, in the CTRL period an almost total absence of rainfall was reported, as in the PL and TL, thus preventing an overestimation of the air quality (Fig. 3).",

Moreover, the effects of PL and TL were similar in all three MeCiMi sections. In the PL phase, the reduction of PM10 was between 32.7% (SaA) and 40.5% (SaB). It was likely attributable to the significant reduction in vehicular traffic given by the transfers restrictions imposed by the Authorities considering that transports represent the main source of PM10 in Milan and in the whole MeCiMi (40.7\u201345%) (Fig. S1). The TL period marked a further overall decrease in PM10 of 13.1% - 18.9% compared to the PL. This result can be partially attributed to the stop of industrial activities that allowed reducing direct emissions and, consequently, decrease workers' transfers. In both periods, the contribution given by the reduction of building heating cannot be neglected. Although the average temperature of CTRL period was comparable with that registered in the PL and TL (Table S4), it should be considered that in the MeCiMi, as reported by Lombardy emissions inventory (Fig. S1), household heating counts for a 22.5\u201328.8% of the total PM10 emitted.

As for PM10, these results can be attributed: (i) in the PL phase mainly to the reduction of vehicular traffic (primary PM2.5) and (ii) in the TL phase also to the reduction of emissions from industrial activities. The low reduction from the PL to the TL period can also be caused to the relatively low contribution of the industrial sector in PM2.5 emissions in Milan and in SaA (15.3% and 25.9%, respectively) (Fig. S1). The reduction of PM2.5 in PL and TL can be also attributed to the simultaneous reduction in the concentration of other pollutants such as NH3 (Fig. S2), volatile organic compounds (e.g. benzene) (Section 3.4), and NOx (Section 3.6) which act as precursors to the formation of secondary PM2.5 (Chen et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018). As in the case of PM10, the influence of the reduction of other combustion processes due to domestic heating cannot be excluded as household heating in MeCiMi determines the 28\u201334.5% of the total PM2.5 emission (Fig. S1).",

Compared to the CTRL period, the percentage reduction was 57.5% and 71%, in the PL and TL respectively (Fig. 4). As the major source in Milan is represented by the traffic (as well as other minor BC combustion sources, including household heating and cooking are possible) (Fig. S1) (Invernizzi et al., 2011; Mousavi et al., 2019), these results confirm the identification of the reduction of traffic in PL and TL as the main source of the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 in the city of Milan.

While in Milan it is possible to estimate that during the reference period the traffic contributes 78.8% to the emission of CO, in SaA and SaB this percentage drops to 74.6% and 55.5%, respectively. These aspects confirm the greater impact in terms of CO reduction of the reduction of vehicular traffic and transport in the city of Milan than in the other two adjacent areas.

The growth of O3 is usual during spring and summer owing to higher solar radiation (in terms of intensity and daily duration), which promotes the photolysis of NO2 (Escudero et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Fig. 7\nshows the dependence of the concentration of O3 in CTRL, PL and TL on solar radiation and daylight hours. The increase in daylight hours (from 9.5 \u00b1 0.2 h in the CTRL period to 12 \u00b1 0.2 h in the TL period) might appear a crucial factor causing higher O3 concentrations. However, this aspect is not sufficient to explain the data. In fact, in MeCiMi, from 2016 to 2018 the average concentration of O3 in February and March was 10\u201320 \u03bcg m\u22123 and 30\u201340 \u03bcg m\u22123, respectively. These values are similar with those recorded in the reference period (20.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg m\u22123) and in PL (43.7 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcg m\u22123) but very lower than TL (59.0 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg m\u22123). The significant lowering of the NO concentration in TL, which, in turns, reacts with O3, could lead to obtain the higher O3 concentrations than the average.",

The severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL resulted in a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic: PM10, PM2.5, BC, benzene, CO, and NOx. For CO, the reduction was specifically appreciable in the city of Milan where vehicular traffic represents the primary source of these emissions in a marked manner. The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the SaA and SaB. This specific reduction in Milan can be partially attributed to the decrease of heating, due to the closure of workplaces, factor playing a minor role in the other two areas. However, further data are required in order to carry out a more accurate evaluation. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in TL, ozone exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. The more accentuated increase in Milan and SaA was, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that may have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.",
