The first 459 nt of TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 are identical. This region includes the 5' noncoding regions of RNA1 and RNA2 as well as two potential in-frame translation initiation sites at AUGTB and AUG,,, . Beginning from the first potential in-frame initiation site at AUG,B, the N-terminal regions of the TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 polyproteins are identical for the first 132 amino acids, and of the next 145 amino acid residues 75.3% of the positions are identical (Fig. 3A ). It is perhaps significant that the second in-frame initiation site at AUG,, occurs shortly after the point where the homology between the RNA1 and the RNA2 polyproteins becomes less than perfect. As described in a previous paper (1 I), AUG,,, is in a better Kozak context for the initiation of translation than AUG,, (13). Since it is unknown whether AUG,, and/or AUG,,, act as initiation sites for translation, it cannot be said whether it is the conservation of amino acid or nucleotide sequence between AUG,, and AUG,,, on RNA1 and RNA2 which is most significant. The deduced amino acid sequence of the regions beginning shortly after AUG,,, on RNA1 and RNA2 could be aligned with the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the 5' terminal region of RNA1 of the nepoviruses tomato blackring (TBRV) and grapevine chrome mosaic (GCMV) (14, 15) ( Fig. 3B ). The fact that these regions of similarity are present only at the N-termini of the TBRV and GCMV RNAl-encoded polyproteins but are present at the N-termini of both TomRSV RNA1 -and RNA2encoded pofyproteins suggests that a large portion of coding and noncoding sequences at the 5' terminus of TomRSV RNA1 have been duplicated and are now present at the 5' terrnini of both RNA1 and RNA2. The function of this coding region in RNA1 is unknown, however, it has been suggested that it may have a role in proteofytic prmessing of the viral-encoded polyprotein (75). It is interesting that in vitro translation studies of cherry feafroll virus (CLRV) RNA2 (16) another nepovirus with a large RNA2 component ( 17) resulted in proteolytic processing of the RNA2 polyprotein in the absence of RNAlencoded protease. It is possible that a subgroup of nepoviruses with large RNA2 components, which would include TomRSV and CLRV (181, may encode another protease on RNA2 which is involved in proteolytic processing. However, it is possibtethirt proteotytic processing of the CLRV RNA2 polyprotein may not be due to a specific viral-encoded protease.",

Amino acids are numbered on the right snd begin at the first M. Numbering in (B) begins at the termination codon (WA) for the RNAl-encoded long ORF as determined from clone J.27. Three nucleotide substitutions in the 3' noncoding region of RNA2 (I 7) compared to RNA1 are shown below the sequence of RNA1 mini of RNA1 and RNA2 of the tobravirus tobacco rattle virus (TRV) strain PLB (6). However, after several passages of a pseudorecombinant consisting of RNA1 from TRV strain TCM and RNA2 from strain PLB, which differ at their 3'termini in 39 of 820 nt, a recombinant RNA molecule was not detected. Not only was RNA recombination in this system not detected experimentally, but the viability of a pseudorecombinant consisting of heterologous 3' termini in RNA1 and RNA2 suggests that in this system precise 3'terminal sequences in RNA1 and RNA2 are not essential for replication. It has been suggested that the high frequency of homologous recombination in the animal picornaviruses is important for removing deleterious mutations introduced by the poor fidelity of the RNA replicase (22) . Since it has been suggested that the picornavirus replicative machinery may not function efficiently in trans, nondefective genes, located on different RNA molecules which possess errors in genes involved in replication, can only be utilized after genetic recombination with an RNA molecule which encodes functional replicative genes (23, 24) . It is possible that, in TomRSV, replication begins in cis with RNA1 and that vans replication of RNA2 occurs only following disassociation and reassociation of the initial negative-strand transcript with the corresponding region in RNA2. A similar mechanism involving recombination could account for the sequence conservation observed between the 5' termini of RNA1 and RNA2. Such a mechanism has recently been proposed for leader-primed generation of subgenomic RNAs in coronaviruses (see 7). The size of the duplicated sequences in TomRSV may be the minimum required to facilitate efficient replication through RNA recombination between RNA1 and RNA2. Alternatively, the entire length may not be required for recombination but may serve other important functions in addition to a postulated role in recombination. We are planning further experiments to determine the biological significance of the repeated sequences between TomRSV RNA1 and RNA2 and whether they are in fact involved in RNA recombination during replication.",
