Disease is typified by mild enteritis; however sporadic outbreaks, usually in puppies, of haemorrhagic and fatal enteritis have been attributed to CECoV (Buonavoglia et al., 2006, Evermann et al., 2005, Pratelli, 2005). Severe disease outbreaks appear to be associated with the evolution of novel highly pathogenic strains of CECoV (Decaro et al., 2008). Coinfection with other enteric pathogens such as canine parvovirus appears to have a synergistic effect (Pratelli et al., 1999b).",

The original strain is now designated as type II CECoV, whereas the more recently identified strain, first reported in 2003, is known as type I CECoV (Pratelli et al., 2003a). The strains are named in this way due to their respective homologies to types II and I feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Infection may occur with a single strain, however mixed infections with both types appear to be common (Decaro et al., 2005). CECoV is distinct from the newly recognised canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), which is implicated in the canine infectious respiratory disease complex and falls into a separate group of the coronavirus family (Erles et al., 2003).",

This leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the epidemiology of this disease in the dog population as a whole.

However, in pilot experiments, a <10-fold loss in sensitivity was found, using the conventional PCR assay, when CECoV spiked faecal samples were left at room temperature for 7 days (Fig. 6\n). As 98.3% of the samples were received at the laboratory within 7 days of collection, this time delay is unlikely to have been a major contributory factor to the low prevalence detected, although some potential effect cannot be ruled out in those few samples which were delayed in the post for longer periods.",

Most studies have focussed on diarrhoeic or kennelled dogs, and there is little data on the prevalence of CECoV in the wider dog population, including healthy pet dogs. Such information is, however, important in increasing our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. In the present study, we have targeted this population of both asymptomatic and diarrhoeic dogs through a cross-sectional study survey of randomly selected veterinary practices from throughout the UK. In order to maximise compliance, random selection was not used at the client level, and it is possible that this may have caused some bias.",

This contrasts with a more recent study in which a prevalence of 17.5% was detected by electron microscopy in 200 healthy dogs in Germany (Schulz et al., 2008). The variability of prevalence estimates depends on factors such as the detection methods used and the characteristics and disease status of the dog population under study. In addition, it is possible that the prevalence of CECoV in a population might fluctuate over time and that any prevalence estimate will be dependent on the timing of sampling.",

However, the number of CECoV positive dogs in our study was small, and this makes the power to detect an association low. There are a number of possible reasons why relatively few diarrhoeic dogs were positive for CECoV in our study. Mild diarrhoea in dogs is very often non-infectious in origin and in some cases may simply be a natural sequel to dietary indiscretion. Alternatively, other pathogens may have been involved, or if the diarrhoea had been coronaviral in origin, virus shedding may have stopped by the time of sampling.",

Dogs have been shown to shed CECoV for a variable but potentially long time following infection and clinical resolution (Decaro et al., 2005). In one natural infection study, one animal was reported to shed CECoV for up to 156 days even though signs of clinical disease only lasted for 10 days post-infection (Pratelli et al., 2002).

There is some suggestion that type I CECoV may be shed at higher titres and for a longer period than type II, and if this is indeed the case this could lead to an enhanced probability of detecting type I CECoV in a cross-sectional study of this kind (Decaro et al., 2005). Type 1 CECoV virus was first described in 2003 in Italy (Pratelli et al., 2003b) and has since been reported in other countries (Yesilbag et al., 2004, Rennhofer et al., 2005). Recent evidence, based on the discovery of a new open reading frame present in type I CECoV (Lorusso et al., 2008a, Stavisky et al., 2008), with residual fragments in type II CECoV, and the closely related feline coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, suggests that type I CECoV may actually represent the ancestral virus of this group (Lorusso et al., 2008b).",

It has also been suggested that such signs can be seen with type I (Benetka et al., 2006). Since more virulent strains appear to evolve spontaneously (Decaro et al., 2008, Zappulli et al., 2007), it may be that both types I and II have the ability to cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, and this variation in virulence may depend on both viral evolution and host factors such as age and immune status.

            "text": "Recognition of CECoV in practice is hampered by the fact that commercial diagnostic tests suitable for the detection of types I and II CECoV are not widely available. Electron microscopy is relatively insensitive, and serological assays are based on type II CECoV, which limits their use as they have unknown efficacy in detecting type I. In addition, since seroprevalence in the general dog population is relatively high, such tests are difficult to interpret in relation to diagnosing acute disease unless paired samples are taken. The efficacy of currently available CECoV vaccines, which are all based on type II CECoV, is also unclear. The only data on cross-protection available to date is based on in vitro work and suggests that the level of antigenic cross-reactivity between the two types may be limited (Pratelli et al., 2004). Clearly, this should also be assessed in challenge experiments in vivo.",

Subclinically infected animals within the general dog population, as identified by this study, may represent an important reservoir of infection, playing a significant role in the epidemiology of this disease and the evolution of the virus.",
