Such diseases were formerly called anthropozoonoses (Greek \u201canthr\u00f3pos\u201d=man, \u201czoon\u201d=animal, \u201cnosos\u201d=disease), whereas the diseases transmissible from humans to animals were called zooanthroponoses (Hub\u00e1lek, 2003). Today, the term zoonoses is commonly used for infectious diseases that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man (WHO/FAO, 1959). The total number of zoonoses is unknown, but according to Taylor et al. (2001), who in 2001 cataloged 1415 known human pathogens, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa, and 287 helminths, 61% were zoonotic. With time, more and more human pathogens are found to be of animal origin. Interestingly, wild animals seem to be involved in the epidemiology of most zoonoses and serve as significant reservoirs for transmission of zoonotic agents to domestic animals and man.",

Influenza viruses have different hosts, both birds and different mammals including humans, and have a zoonotic potential. An antigenic shift in influenza A virus can cause the sudden emergence of a new subtype of the virus. Although this shift occurs only occasionally, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, have no antibody protection against the new subtype of virus, resulting in a worldwide epidemic (\u201cpandemic\u201d). Three major influenza A pandemics emerged during the 20th century. Of these, the Spanish flu in 1918\u20131919 (subtype H1N1) was the most severe with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006). The Asian flu in 1957\u20131958 (H2N2) and the Hong Kong flu in 1968\u20131969 (H3N2) caused less serious pandemics. The latter two are known to be the result of a reassortment between an avian influenza strain from wild waterfowl and a human strain of influenza A, with the introduction of a new hemagglutinin protein in the human strain.",

Mosquitoes are the most important arthropod vectors (examples of viral zoonoses transmitted by mosquitoes are Rift Valley fever, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis), followed by ticks, sandflies, and midges. Arthropod vector-borne viruses are called arboviruses and are maintained in complex life cycles involving a non-human vertebrate primary host and a primary arthropod vector. The arthropod vector becomes infected when it ingests virus while feeding on the blood of a viremic animal. Virus replicates in the arthropod tissues, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The arthropod then transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infectious salivary fluid while taking a blood meal. Arthropod-borne viruses generally remain undetected until the virus escapes the primary cycle via a secondary vector or secondary vertebrate host, such as when humans enter the enzootic cycle. Although humans may become ill as a result of these viruses, they are generally considered dead-end hosts for many of the viruses because they do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors and thus do not contribute to the transmission cycle. Notable exceptions include dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Ross River virus infections (www.acpmedicine.com/sample2/ch0731s.htm).",

Clearing of forested land in Bolivia in the early 1960s was accompanied by blanket spraying of DDT to control malaria-bearing mosquitoes, and incidentally killed many village cats leading to decreased control of mice near human populations. Large areas with maize supported huge populations of Calomys mice carrying Machupo virus; this resulted in the appearance of the Bolivian hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate (McMichael, 2004).

Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 after significant epidemics in Yambuku, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) and in Nzara, Sudan. Since its first discovery in 1976, there was a second Ebola outbreak in Nzara in 1979, then an outbreak 15 years later in Gabon in1994, and a major epidemic in Kikwit, DRC, in 1995 (with 315 cases and 250 deaths). Since then, new outbreaks have occurred almost each year. The largest outbreak ever occurred in Uganda in 2000\u20132001 with a total of 425 cases and a fatality rate of 53% (WHO, 2000).",

Humans as well as other primates are severely affected by Ebola virus, which is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected individuals. Infection of humans has also been documented to have occurred as a result of handling infected chimpanzees and gorillas found dead in the rainforests, which suggests that they are not a reservoir since they die from the infection. Interestingly, bats experimentally infected with Ebola virus do not die. Furthermore, evidence of asymptomatic Ebola virus infection was found in three species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks in humans and great apes between 2001 and 2003 in Gabon and DRC. This evidence that fruit bats may be acting as reservoirs for Ebola virus supports previous evidence suggesting bats as candidate reservoirs for Ebola virus and the closely related Marburg virus (Leroy et al., 2005). If this is correct, humans coming into greater contact with bats because of encroaching agriculture may be at increasing risk for outbreaks of Ebola virus infection.",

The concurrent appearance of several bat-associated viruses implies that changes in the ecology of fruit bats, as opposed to evolution of the pathogen itself, is the likely explanation for the spillover to new hosts (Daszak et al., 2004). The ecological trigger for the Nipah virus outbreak appears to have been a complex series of alterations to the fruit bat habitat caused by human activities including agriculture, in combination with a period of drought. The fruit bat's habitat was largely replaced in peninsular Malaysia by oil palm plantations. Deforestation in Sumatra, coupled with a serious drought and fires caused by a major El Nino-event in 1997, led to significant air-pollution haze that covered large areas in Malaysia and parts of Southeast Asia. This reduced the flowering of forest trees and caused a marked decline in forest fruit production, resulting in the encroachment of bats into fruit plantations where pig farms were also maintained (Chua et al., 2002). The culling of hundreds of thousands of pigs probably stopped the Nipah virus epidemic; human-to-human transmission has not been demonstrated.",

The African squirrel is probably the natural host. Transmission to humans occurs by contact with infected animals or body fluids. The cases in the United States, the first outside Africa, were associated with contact with infected prairie dogs. The outbreak was epidemiologically linked to an import of African rodents from Ghana. It is most likely that infected rodents imported into the United States transmitted the virus to prairie dogs. This illustrates the fact that non-native animal species can create serious public health problems when they introduce a viral disease to native animal and human populations. Thus, the transportation, sale, or distribution of animals, or the release of animals into the environment, can contribute to the spread of zoonoses.",

Sequence analysis of samples from human lymphocytes revealed three viruses with known associations with three different non-human primates, associated with individual histories of contact with blood or body fluids from those primates, thus indicating separate zoonotic transmissions from gorilla, mandrill, and Brazza's guenon (Wolfe et al., 2004).",

The simian counterpart of HTLV-3, STLV-3, has been identified in wild-caught monkey species from several different ecosystems in Africa (Meertens and Gessain, 2003). So far, HTLV-3 infection has not been linked to disease and it is not known whether it is transmissible between humans. (HTLV-4 was identified in a Cameroonian bushmeat hunter (Wolfe et al., 2005a).

There are only three A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) known to be currently circulating among humans as seasonal influenza. The seasonal influenza epidemics occur as a result of genetic drift, the accumulation of point mutations that occur due to lack of proofreading (Webster et al., 1992). Antigenic shift, an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins of the virus, causes the sudden emergence of a new subtype of a type A virus that is antigenically distinct from former circulating influenza A viruses. The new virus is potentially capable of causing an epidemic in an immunologically na\u00efve human population (Webster et al., 1992). Worldwide epidemics, called pandemics, occur only occasionally.",

There is evidence that H5N1 is now endemic in parts of Asia, having established a permanent ecological niche in poultry. As of January 2006, H5N1 has spread to Europe, with outbreaks among wild birds (Croatia and Romania), poultry (Turkey, Romania, and Ukraine), and humans (Turkey). Genomic analyses of H5N1 virus isolates from birds and humans show that the hemagglutinin has undergone significant antigenic drift since 1997 (Horimoto et al., 2004).

The intimate interface between a loop of the S-protein of viruses from the SARS epidemic in 2002\u20132003 and human ACE2 mediates efficient binding and infection of the cell, which probably is a key factor in determining the severity and possibly human-to-human transmission (Li F. et al., 2005). In contrast, S-protein from viruses of sporadic SARS cases in 2003 and 2004, each of which was an independent cross-species event with no further human-to-human transmission, had amino acids that more closely resembled the civet virus. The outcome was a reduced binding to human ACE2 and less efficient infection. Epidemiological investigation of the 2003 and 2004 SARS cases showed that SARS-CoV-positive palm civets, kept alive in cages close to the customers while waiting to be prepared as dinners in a restaurant, were the source for transmission to a waitress working in the restaurant and to a customer eating there (Wang M. et al., 2005).",

Species-specific strains of SIV (like SIVsm and SIVagm) have been identified in more than 30 African primate species, but all except SIVcpz infect monkeys. SIVs seem to be non-pathogenic in the vast majority of natural hosts despite high levels of virus replication (Apetrei et al., 2004). This may be a consequence of the fact that the incubation period of the disease generally exceeds the life span of the host. SIVs also have a high propensity for cross-species transmission. SIV phylogeny is complex and analyses indicate recombination among viruses from different major lineages. Of the identified recombinants, SIVcpz so far represents the most important one, being the source of the HIV-1 pandemic. SIVrcm from red-capped mangabeys and SIVgsn from greater spot-nosed monkeys are most closely related to SIVcpz, but they are similar only in certain regions of the genome that do not overlap. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of subsets of SIV strains comparing the topologies among four regions of the proteome have provided evidence for a more recent origin of SIVcpz than of other strains, being a result of recombination between ancestors of SIVgsn and SIVrcm (Bailes et al., 2003). The geographic region of these two monkey species overlaps that of the chimpanzee and it is known that chimpanzees hunt smaller monkeys for food. The founder chimpanzee most likely was infected by one of the ancestor SIVs and thereafter became superinfected by the other ancestor virus, leading to recombination in a doubly infected cell.",

First, it provides evidence that, in addition to humans, another primate species can acquire cross-species transmission under natural conditions. Second, the hybrid virus had adapted to the host and established substantial secondary spread within the species. Third, the chimpanzee virus was capable of spreading to humans. Moreover, the chimpanzee most likely acquired SIV-infection relatively recently, subsequent to the split of the chimpanzee into two subspecies, since SIVcpz has not been found in the third chimpanzee subspecies, P. troglodytes verus.",

One is the integration of the reversely transcribed provirus into the cellular genome, causing a life-long infection. Another is the potential for superinfection, in which recombination may occur when a cell becomes infected with two genetically distinct viruses. During reverse transcription, the reverse transcriptase can switch from one RNA template to the other, thereby generating a progeny that is a mosaic of the parent viruses (Preston et al., 1988). HIV-1 genomes with this kind of mosaic structure are called circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). There are an increasing number of such CRFs identified; CRF 01_AE is mainly responsible for the HIV epidemic in Southeast Asia (Takebe et al., 2003; Watanaveeradej et al., 2003). These CRFs now constitute 10\u201320% of newly characterized circulating strains (Perrin et al., 2003).",

It is thus important to integrate medical, veterinary, ecological, and other sciences in interdisciplinary teams (Daszak et al., 2004, FAO, WHO, and OIE, 2004). The role of bats in the etiology of many viral zoonoses illustrates the challenges of prevention and control (Dobson, 2005). Bats represent a reservoir of rabies, Hendra, Menangle, and Nipah viruses. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that bats may be the wildlife reservoir of Ebola virus and one of the reservoirs of SARS-CoV (Leroy et al., 2005; Li W. et al., 2005). Although SARS-CoV isolated from humans appeared to derive from a nearly identical virus circulating in masked palm civets and racoon dogs (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005), subsequent studies did not reveal widespread infection in wild or farmed civets, and experimental infection of civets with human SARS-CoV resulted in overt clinical symptoms suggesting that they are not the reservoir. A recent large study of different bat species from four locations in China showed a high prevalence and wide distribution of SARS-CoV-seropositive bats (Lau et al., 2005; Li W. et al., 2005). Although horseshoe bats appear to be the natural reservoir of a SARS-like corona virus (SL-CoV), it is not clear how this virus could have got from the bat or another reservoir to humans. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV are phylogenetically located within the spectrum of these SL-CoVs. One possibility is that bats passed the virus to civets or to other animals in the wild or in the live animal markets of southern China.",

Efficient surveillance is dependent upon a laboratory system that is capable of identifying and characterizing the pathogens in question. More research is needed to understand better the epidemiology and pathogenesis of various zoonoses, to improve diagnostic methods, and to develop cost-effective vaccines and drugs. Training and education are prerequisites in order to enable the personnel involved at the various stages, from field to laboratory personnel, to detect zoonoses. Information and communication are key components in any prevention and control strategy, and this should also involve the general public. The importance of public education and behavioral change are critical factors for successful intervention.
