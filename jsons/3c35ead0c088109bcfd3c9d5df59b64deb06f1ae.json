In fact, stigma is, in a way, discrimination against a group of people and in context of COVID-19 disease, it is attributed to factors such as lack of awareness about its spread, along with fear and excessive anxiety about it. In some opinion ,stigma actually begins with the threat of losing what it has and can traverse many social and even moral arenas (5) .",
