However, retreatment of PTB has often developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs. The cure rate (approximately 50.0-73.3%) and management of retreatment of PTB in China needs to be improved. Qinbudan decoction has been widely used to treat PTB in China since the 1960s. Previously clinical studies have shown that the Qinbudan tablet (QBDT) promoted sputum-culture negative conversion and lesion absorption. However, powerful evidence from a randomized controlled clinical trial is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of QBDT as an adjunct therapy for retreatment of PTB.",

Anti-TB treatment options included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. Primary outcome was sputum-culture conversion using the MGIT 960 liquid medium method. Secondary outcomes included lung lesion absorption and cavity closure. Adverse events and reactions were observed after treatment. A structured questionnaire was used to record demographic information and clinical symptoms of all subjects. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 software in the full analysis set (FAS) population.",

An updated meta-analysis demonstrated that multi-drug resistance among new and retreatment cases was 4.8 and 26.3%, respectively [3] . In a national survey of drug-resistant TB (DRTB) conducted in China, 34.2% of patients developed new TB infections, while 54.5% of previously-treated patients developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs [4] . In China, the cure rate for retreatment PTB was approximately 50.0-73.3% [5] [6] [7] . In many cases, retreatment represented the patient's last chance of a cure. The standard anti-TB treatment regimen for retreatment PTB was isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. It increased the use of second-line injection of streptomycin and extended the consolidation period when compared with newly-treated TB. Several adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver function impairment, and renal insufficiency often affected the patient's compliance, which was not conducive to treatment outcome [8] .",

By consulting ancient texts and clinician's judgment of more than 1000 cases of PTB from the mid-1960s to the 1980s, the compound decoction of Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis), Baibu (Stemona stemonae), and Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhizae) was found to be effective in treating PTB [14, 15] . Based on herbal medicine records, Baibu, Huangqin, and Danshen were important drugs for the treatment of PTB, which improved the cure rate of PTB. To improve drug efficacy and administration, tablets were prepared following an aqueous saturated lime precipitation and ethanol extraction method. The formulation was changed to tablets to improve clinical convenience. QBDT have been widely used in Shanghai since the mid-1980s, even in patients with DRTB [16] .",

Tanshinone is beneficial in the recovery of patients after TB infection by decreasing hypoxic injury and inhibiting calcium accumulation [20] . Both in vitro and in vivo, QBDT may have bacteriostatic effects on TB bacteria by improving hemorheology, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration, and toxin secretion [21] [22] [23] . According to recent studies, QBDT can upregulate the expression of Toll-like receptor 2, which is one of the mechanisms through which QBDT acts against TB infection [24] .",

At 8 months after the end of treatment, the total culture conversion rate of the QBDT group was 79.6% (74/93, 95% CI: 70.3-86.5), which was 10.3% higher when compared with the placebo group (69.3%, 61/88, 95% CI: 59.1-78.0). However, the differences were not significant (rate difference = 0.10, 95% CI: \u2212 0.02-0.23; F = 2.48, P = 0.12) when using the covariate sites to correct the rate differences. It is well known that the sensitivity of anti-TB drugs is crucial for the negative conversion of sputum, therefore, subgroup analysis was performed based on the sensitivity of the drugs. As shown in Table 4 , the adjuvant therapy of QBDT improved the sputum negative conversion in patients who were sensitive or resistant to pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. None of the patients showed significant negative conversion, although patients who were sensitive to pyrazinamide tended to significantly improve the negative conversion.",

The data demonstrated that adjuvant therapy using QBDT improved the sputum negative conversion in patients who were sensitive or resistant to pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, thereby suggesting that QBDT may not directly act on bacteria and primarily activated host immunity to clear a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Surprisingly, patients who were sensitive to pyrazinamide tended to significantly improve the negative conversion rate. It is currently recognized that the addition of pyrazinamide to the anti-TB regimen can shorten the long-term treatment course, which is equivalent to the \"guide herbs\" in the compatibility of TCM prescriptions. Therefore, in pyrazinamidesensitive patients, the two \"guide herbs\" including pyrazinamide and QBDT may show a stronger sputum negative culture effect. Although we did not observe a QBDT Qinbudan tablet significant difference overall, there was a trend to improvement in sputum conversion. Furthermore, QBDT was found to significantly promote lesion absorption as a complementary therapy for retreatment PTB. Scar tissue associated with PTB can affect the long-term health of patients, especially those with immunocompromised relapse. Therefore, studies to reduce lung injury due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and novel ways to improve the sputum-culture negative conversion should be investigated. For example, TB might be the most important secondary causes of bronchiectasis.",

Although the sputum negative conversion had been improved significantly, these studies had some limitations. In short, the evaluation of sputum negative conversion was not based on at least two negative conversions recommended by the WHO in the last 3 months of treatment; the study design did not implement blinded methods, which increased the information bias of the study results; the chemotherapy regimens were not conducted in accordance with the standard anti-TB regimen recommended by WHO, included the use of rifabutin, rifapentin, or the addition of levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.",

TCM might mainly focus on the pathological aspects of disease, such as the immune inflammatory response, including systemic and localized lesions caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, changes in blood circulation, and the body's metabolic state, in addition to the removal of pathogenic micro-organisms. The beneficial characteristics of TCM allow for more of a \"holistic view\", and pay more attention to the overall changes in the body's disease state.
