Ward et al. (2008) used adult male African green monkeys as a preclinical pharmacokinetic model to validate their utility for predicting human pharmacokinetics using a set of marketed compounds. African green monkey was considered a viral reservoir which might spread viral pathogens to humans (Chahroudi et al., 2012). Some research investigated certain viruses in African green monkeys. Oberste et al. (2013) investigated three picornavirus genera (Enterovirus, Parechovirus, and Sapelovirus) in African green monkeys at the Dazark Zoo of Bangladesh, but none was detected. Gallagher et al. (2017) detected simian picobirnaviruses in fecal samples from diarrhea-free African green monkeys of the Caribbean region. However, little research has reported the virome in stools of African green monkeys.",

Although most enterovirus infections are asymptomatic, some may cause serious or fatal diseases, such as acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, epidemic pleurodynia, diarrhea and severe respiratory disease (Pallansch et al., 2013; Pons-Salort et al., 2015; Scully et al., 2018). Enteroviruses may circulate between humans and NHPs. Some enterovirus types with a worldwide distribution in humans have been detected in NHPs (Sadeuh-Mba et al., 2014; Mombo et al., 2015). It is therefore extremely important to identify the circulating enteroviruses among NHPs because they might mutate and infect humans, thereby causing new emerging diseases. Recently, a growing number of enteroviruses were reported in NHPs. SEV-gx was identified from stool samples of rhesus macaques (Ao et al., 2016). Mombo (Mombo et al., 2017) detected EV-B112 in a chimpanzee fecal sample and EV-B113 in a mandrill fecal sample. Wang et al. (2016) identified Sev-nj1 from a fecal sample from rhesus. In this study, we detected six novel enteroviruses in stool samples from captive African green monkeys with diarrhea in China. Strain CHN/BJ/2018-1A might be a member of species Enterovirus A, most of which can infect humans. It had the highest similarity with human enterovirus 92 strain RJG7, which was found in an NHP with diarrhea (Oberste et al., 2007). The other five strains had the closest relationships with strain 1631 of species Enterovirus J isolated from Macaca mulatta (Oberste et al., 2007). These six strains were found in five separate monkeys in this study. Coinfection of strain CHN/BJ/2018-1A and CHN/BJ/2018-1J was detected in one African green monkey. Whether the six enteroviruses were pathogenic to African green monkeys should be verified by additional research. Substantial attention and surveillance of these enteroviruses in African green monkeys and people who had contact with these animals may be necessary.",

Enterovirus genotype was currently defined as sharing greater than 75% nucleotide similarity and greater than 85% amino acid identity in the VP1 coding region (Lukashev et al., 2018).

In this study, picobirnavirus sequences were detected from seven out of ten stool samples of green monkeys with diarrhea, suggesting a high picobirnavirus infection ratio in African green monkeys. Picobirnavirus strain PBV/Simian/KNA/08873/2015 RdRp sequence detected from an African green monkey in the Caribbean region (Gallagher et al., 2017) had 69.93% nucleotide similarity (92% coverage) and 63.27% amino acid identity (100% coverage) with that of the picobirnavirus in this study, illustrating the great diversity among picobirnaviruses in African green monkeys. The high nucleotide similarity (93%) of picobirnavirus RdRp detected in this study with that of human picobirnavirus GPBV6C2 found in a stool specimen from a patient with diarrhea indicated that African green monkey could be a reservoir of human picobirnavirus. The possibility that human picobirnaviruses could circulate among African green monkeys and humans could not be eliminated. Picobirnavirus strains in this study had a 100% identity, while enteroviruses showed diversity among the same animal colony. These viruses might have different evolutionary histories or dynamics, which is worthy of further investigations.",

Full genomic characterisation of six enterovirus strains and a picobirnavirus RdRp sequence were depicted. Two new genotypes of enteroviruses were defined. The enteroviruses and picobirnavirus identified in this study are worthy of further investigation to clarify their pathogenicity, and surveillance is needed to determine their transmission to humans or other animals.",
