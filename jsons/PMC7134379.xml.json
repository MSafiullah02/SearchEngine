Information and communication technologies and other related digital technologies especially digital platforms have brought along with them a new dimension to how society is evolving, especially in relation to how people interact and transact business. They have in their own unique way also introduced new challenges and concerns for users. Some of the challenges and concerns pertaining to the protection of the privacy and sensitive information of users of these technologies. Identity theft is a major example of such challenges faced by users of these technologies, as Cavoukian (2013) noted, identity theft is the fastest-growing form of consumer fraud in North America. The problem of identity theft is not peculiar to North America alone, several authors have reported a growing incidence of this problem around the world (Kahn and Li\u00f1ares-Zegarra 2016; Reyns 2013; Williams 2016). The issue of identity theft has become ubiquitous especially as a result of the migration of a lot of activities associated with human social and economic activities to online platforms.",

Consequently, the regimes of digital safety and security as informed by the threat of online identity theft that has become prevalent globally should not be merely viewed as a political reaction to the risks brought about by the proliferation of digital in society. Rather, online identity theft further constitutes an active threat and factor that influences consumers\u2019 purchase intentions especially in developing economies where proactive measures of protection are not particularly up to the standards obtainable in more advanced economies. Thus, where the incipient digital society is collectively re-imagined, negotiated, and created.",

            "text": "Therefore, online identity theft is an issue of major concern for online retailers of goods and services in these developing economy markets where the state of an emerging digital society and the sociotechnical relationships of checks and balances required to govern its emergence are in a constant state of transition (Haddad and Binder 2019). Though the work by Jordan et al. (2018) replicated some constructs used in this present study to measure the impact of fear of identity theft, perceived risk in online purchase intentions; their work was not narrowed to measure the mediating role of online security and privacy concern that becomes the focal lens of this study. Moreover, their research was neither specific to young students in public higher institutions or to the more definite of an emerging economy\u2019s context considered in this paper. We further argue that given the varied and complex reasons manifesting in low levels of eCommerce transactions in the developing world, such as low level of internet penetrations, high levels of income poverty, a high rate of illiteracy, and infrastructural challenges that manifest in logistical inefficiencies even have a repelling effect on purchase intentions. Based on these insights, the current study aims at addressing the prognosis of online identity theft on consumer purchase intentions from a developing economy\u2019s perspective by (1) Evaluating the predictive influence of identity theft (FOFL and FORD) towards online transactions (2) Establishing the mediating role of online security and privacy concern (OSPCON) towards online purchase intentions/transactions. Specifically, two research questions emerged:RQI: What impact does online identity theft have on online transactions from university students in a developing country (Ghana)?RQ2: What influence does the mediating effect of OSPCON have on online transactions from university students in a developing economy (Ghana)?\n",

            "text": "According to Gurung and Raja (2016), concerns about privacy protection is one of the primary obstacles for consumers to participate in electronic eCommerce transactions that require them to divulge personal information, such as their date of birth, social security number, personal phone number, and credit card information, etc. This makes the protection of consumers\u2019 privacy as an important factor for the success of e-commerce businesses. This view is also supported by Mart\u00edn et al. (2011) who in their research focused on online shoppers in Portugal, explored the effect of trust on perceived benefits of online purchase, by looking at how security and privacy considerations of the online shoppers in Portugal influenced their trust levels and confidence to use the system. They found a causal relationship between users\u2019 perceptions of risk and their decision to trust the system, which ultimately influenced their purchase intentions along with the perceived benefits of using the system. Hence, based on evidence in order to extend the scope of understanding based on scientific evidence, the following hypothesis is proposed as a basis to investigate the causal relationship between fear of financial loss and online customers\u2019 purchase intentions, this will be done by looking at the mediating effects (if any) of online security vis-\u00e0-vis privacy concernsH1: Fear of financial loss will predict online customers\u2019 purchase intentions via the mediating effect of online security and privacy concern.H3: Fear of financial loss directly affects online customers\u2019 purchase intention.\n",

Some of these factors bother on issues such as the fear of reputational damage that is connected to online security and privacy concerns held by consumers. As part of scientific inquiry that aims to investigate the relationships between fear of reputational damage and issues such perceived risk associated the intentions to embark on online transactions from the consumers\u2019 perspective, results from the research conducted by Jordan et al. (2018) showed that there is a positive correlation in the relationship between fear of financial losses, fear of reputational damage, perceived risk, and the relation between the constructs of perceived risk and online purchase intention was negative. Their research was conducted within the context of understanding the impact of fear of identity theft and perceived risk on the Online Purchase Intention of consumers. This is in tandem with the works by other researchers who have investigated related issues Gurung and Raja (2016) and that of Jordan et al. (2018). Consequently, this research further aims to investigate specifically, how the fear of reputational damage influences online consumers\u2019 purchase intentions with online security and privacy concerns as mediating effects. Hence, the relevant hypothesis is proposed as followsH2: Fear of reputation damage will predict online customers \u2018purchase intentions via the mediating effect of online security and privacy concernH4: Fear of reputational damage directly affects online customers\u2019 purchase intention.\n",

This stage confirms that indicator variables (unobserved) are actually measuring constructs (observed variables) they ought to do. Therefore, we assessed our measurement model using convergent validity, and reliability following the suggestion of Hair et al. (2014). Consistent with recent investigations, and also acknowledging the initial step in evaluating PLS-SEM results as earlier suggested, the measurement model must be first assessed, using the indicator loadings (see Hair et al. 2017). With this in mind, loadings of approximately 0.708 are deemed fit since they best explain more than 50% of the indicator variance, hence providing an acceptable threshold for item reliability. Going by this rule of thumb, all items associated with our indicator reliability exhibited more than 50% of the indicator cross-loadings which suggest the level of associations (items correlation) to their respective construct (see Table 1).",

Therefore, both CA and CR exceeded the baseline recording as follows for all the latent constructs as 0.92, 0.93 respectively for FOFL, 0.86, 0.91 respectively for FORD, 0.84, 0.91 respectively for OPI and 0.89, 0.93 respectively for OSPCON. For convergent validity, the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was used to measure the extent to which the constructs congregate in order to explain the variance of all items on each construct (Hair et al. 2019). However, the minimum acceptable AVE is 0.50 or more, thus an indication of 50% or more on how the variance of items makes up with the specified construct. Reflecting on this threshold, all AVE for our latent constructs exceeded the minimum acceptable baseline (see Table 1) for more details.",

Therefore, the assessment of the structural model follows a procedure which took inspiration from (Hair et al. 2017) in order to advance issues in partial least squares structural equation modeling. To proceed, it is important to remind readers that the focal point of this study was to measure the mediation of OSPCON on FOFL and FORD towards OPI consequently the direct effect of OSPCON on the former. To accomplish this, we examined two direct relations, namely, H2 and H4 whiles the remaining hypothesized scenarios were centered on the observation of mediated relationship (i.e. H1 and H3). Going by our empirical estimates, our findings from the direct relationships revealed that FOFL has a positive coefficient but a weak predictor of OPI. However, the bootstrapping t-test (with t* > 1.96 as significant level), but our estimate indicated an insignificant direct relationship (\u03b2 = 0.099, t = 0.649) between FOFL and OPI which therefore does not offer empirical support for H2 (See Table 2 for more details). With respect to H4, our estimate also suggested that FORD though positive and weak predictor of OPI, but also insignificant (\u03b2 = 0.165, t = 0.665) indicating that H4 was not supported. With the mediated observations, it can be seen from Table 2 that OSPCON as a mediator to both FOFL and FORD towards OPI are all supported (H1 and H3), thus, statistically recording as follows: FOFL -> OSPCON -> OPI = (\u03b2 = 0.418, t* = 4.594) and FORD -> OSPCON -> OPI = (\u03b2 = 0.392, t* = 3.740) as shown from Table 2 below.\n",
