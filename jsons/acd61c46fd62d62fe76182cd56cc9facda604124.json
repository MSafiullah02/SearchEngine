Dynamical models cover a broad scope in terms of complexity, ranging from parsimonious and conceptual models [9, 10] , network models that account for population structure and/or host mobility patterns [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , to sophisticated, large-scale computational models [18, 19] that incorporate high resolution data on multi-scale transportation, demographics, epidemiological factors, and behavioral response rules.

The majority of epidemic models are designed to capture epidemiological dynamics of single pathogen species in a host population, characterized by epidemiological parameters associated with a single virus or bacterium. However, bacterial and viral pathogens generically interact, either directly or indirectly by means of their effects on the host. Prominent examples are HIV infections that through immune suppression increase the host's susceptibility towards other infections [20] , including hepatitis [21] , malaria [22] , syphilis, herpes virus, tuberculosis [23, 24] and more. This phenomenon, i.e. being infected with more than one pathogen is known as syndemics or coinfection [25] . Although, coinfections have been well documented and received considerable attention by epidemiologist, the dynamical implication of disease interactions in epidemic progression is unclear and the generic dynamical behavior is poorly understood.",

In these systems different phases such as extinction, coexistence, and onestrain dominance have been identified. In one class of models coinfection is captured by a multiplex network approach [33] [34] [35] , where each infectious agent is transmitted along a different sets of links in the same population [26] [27] [28] . Recently, researchers also considered cooperative pathogen interactions [36] [37] [38] 40] tion with one disease facilitating infection with another pathogen and vice versa. In Ref. [38] , a simple coinfection model of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type was investigated within the framework of cooperative bond percolation. This model exhibits avalanche-like outbreak scenarios, depending on the level of cooperation and the structure of the underlying transmission network. Furthermore, it has been found that highly clustered structures in population aid the proliferation of coinfections, contrary to the effect observed in single disease dynamics [40] . Nevertheless, some fundamental issues remain elusive: What basic dynamical features can we expect in multiple-epidemic spreading with disease-disease interactions? To what extent does coinfection change the classic outbreak scenario of single diseases? How does coinfection dynamics shape the generic features of spatial propagation?",

The kinetics of both diseases follows the generic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) reaction scheme, in which infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptibles at a specified rate. Infected individuals remain infectious for a typical infectious period before they become susceptible again. Based on this model, we show that cooperative coinfections possess a variety of important features that are absent in single disease dynamics. For sufficiently strong cooperation, increasing the infection rate of both diseases yields abrupt, discontinuous outbreak transitions. Furthermore, cooperative coinfection generically exhibits dynamical hysteresis, a consequence of different threshold for disease outbreak and disease eradication. Finally we show that in spatially extended systems, wavefront velocities are considerably accelerated in certain parameter regimes, while the propagation wave can be considerably slowed down when the system approaches the eradication threshold, even progress in a backwards direction.",

An infected node recovers from infection and becomes susceptible again with probability r. The coinfection scenario is modeled analogously. Having two types of infections, we denote the infected states by one of the diseases by A and B, respectively and coinfection by AB (see Fig. 1 ). We assume that susceptibles are infected at probability p, whereas individuals in class A and B are infected with the complementary disease at probability q. Cooperative coinfection corresponds to a scenario with q > p, i.e. being infected by one pathogen increases the infection probability with the other. In contrast, the condition q < p corresponds to antagonistic effects. When q = p the system corresponds to two non-interacting infections. For simplicity we consider identical recovery probabilities (r = 0.5) for both infections [41] .",

Note that although the transition is very steep, it is continuous in the 2d-lattice. Cooperative coinfection therefore exhibits a clear hysteresis in its order parameter. Once a coinfection outbreak has established an endemic state in the population, a large effort is required to eradicate the cooperating diseases.

A prominent difference, however, is that here the eradication phase transition is also discontinuous. This implies that the infection suddenly disappears as the eradication threshold is crossed from above. This different behavior at the EPT in the ER-network is due to the net- work's lack of short loops that are present in the lattice and that are required to sustain coinfection. In the ERnetwork, single infection pertrusions have to move along much longer paths to meet and incite a coinfection spark. Fig. 3a and 3b show typical endemic patterns in the 2dlattice system for independent, non-cooperative (p = q) and cooperative (q = 1) parameter values, both being slightly beyond the critical point. In the first case (Fig. 3a) , the pattern is loosely distributed without any significant spatial structure, with a small fraction of AB infected sites. In contrast, in the cooperative case (Fig. 3b) , the infected clusters exhibit spatial structure, in the sense that the backbones of the infected islands always consist of essential AB individuals that sustain the coinfection. This morphological difference is further evidence that in the cooperative case, it is the disease interaction and a significant fraction of coinfected AB individuals that support the survival in the regime p < p c (see Fig. 2 ). This is evident in Fig. 3c that depicts the fraction individuals that are infected by both diseases normalized by the fraction of infected individuals of all types, i.e. \u03c1 AB /(\u03c1 A +\u03c1 B +\u03c1 AB ). Without cooperation this fraction continuously decreases until the critical points is reached. When cooperation is acting, the fraction of AB individuals remains almost constant until the eradication threshold is reached below which the endemic state col-lapses.",

A bifurcation analysis shows that for weak cooperation (C < 2), the system exhibits a continuous transition, at \u03b1 c = 1, the same threshold as the single SIS case. For C > 2, a bistable region emerges, with a different eradication threshold \u03b1 e c = 2 \u221a C \u2212 1/C. Hence, a hysteresis loop is formed on the interval (\u03b1 e c , \u03b1 c ).

The case of C = 2 has the critical level of cooperation which connects continuous and discontinuous bifurcations yielding a pitchfork bifurcation. This analysis also implies that in the bistable regime, an unstable stationary state exists between both stable states and that only for sufficiently substantial perturbations above this unstable stationary state will invoke a non-trivial endemic state.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the standard properties of wave propagations of pulled-fronts (diffusion into an unstable state) in a spatially extended system is dif- ferent for cooperative coinfection. In order to address these question we investigate the generic generalization of the above model to include spatial coordinates and allow individuals to diffuse in space. For simplicity, we first consider the corresponding reaction-diffusion system in one dimension:",

Here we use also the symmetric parameters for the two diseases and set \u03b3 = 1. For sufficiently localized initial conditions (and only one disease) the above system exhibits a propagating wave asymptotically with a wave front velocity of V = 2 \u03b1D(1 \u2212 1/\u03b1) for \u03b1 > 1, these types of wave fronts are usually referred to as \"pulled fronts\" [46] . Interestingly, very different propagation modes arise in the cooperative coinfection system (red solid line in Fig. 6a ). The first observation is that the velocity is larger than the single disease case for a given \u03b1, which can be explained by cooperative effect and is less surprising. However, a negative wavefront velocity V is found for values of \u03b1 e c < \u03b1 < \u03b1 st , equivalent to a wave that is propagating backwards and shrinking the coinfection bulk. Coinfec-tion cannot be sustained in this range of \u03b1. Note however, that at these values of \u03b1 the diffusion free system possesses a stable coinfection state. Therefore, the diffusion in this regime dilutes the coinfected individuals to a level where the endemic state vanishes. This can only occur, however, in a system that requires a finite threshold (in coinfection the unstable stationary state) above which a concentration needs to grow in order to reach the stable endemic state. The effect becomes more prominent when \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 e c , because the attractive basin of the non-outbreak branch expands to substantial fraction of phase space. A marginal scenario is observed when diffusion and reaction forces balance and yield a stable \"standing wave\" (V = 0) that we also observe in numerical experiments. We denote this point by \u03b1 st , which marks the separation of the two moving directions. Figure 7 illustrating the three typical propagation modes in 2d space are depicted (4)). Bottom panels (i-l): backward propagation (\u03b1 = 0.61). The infected fraction IA+IB +IAB is color coded. The sequence (from left to right) of panels depicts the time course of the infected regions at time t = 0, 100, 200, 300, respectively. Here \u03b1st is slightly different from the value in 1d space, up to the dimension correction. Initial conditions start from some randomly infected round regions with random radius as shown in the first column. Other parameters: C = 10, D = 1.",

We have shown that new dynamical properties emerge as a consequence of cooperative coinfection that are absent in single disease dynamics or antagonistic coinfection dynamics. The most prominent property is the existence of discontin-uous transitions to an endemic state when the disease specific outbreak threshold is crossed and that outbreak and eradication transitions occur at different critical parameters. This is an important insight for designing eradication protocols for pathogens that are known to interact with other diseases in a cooperative way. Because of the universality of this property of intrinsic hysteresis, we believe that with increasing data on interactions between pathogens in traditional epidemiology the simple single threshold concept may have to be revised and extended.",

Epidemic hysteresis is shown for q = 1. On both topologies the outbreak transitions exhibits sudden jumps, while in backward direction the transition is continuous in the lattice and discontinuous in the network. p o c (\u2248 0.181 for the lattice and 0.114 for the network) and p e c (\u2248 0.0437 for the lattice and 0.0265 for the network) denote the outbreak and eradication transition points, respectively. The eradication phase transitions for various values of q are shown in (c) for the lattice and (d) for the networks (d).
