Even though the main gradients in Fennoscandian mires, both on a local and on a regional scale, are well-known (cf. Sjors 1948 Sjors , 1950 Sjors , 1983 Malmer 1962a; Fransson 1972; 0kland & Bendiksen 1985; 0kland 1989a ,b, 1990a , an approach to regional variation by means of variation along gradients has not been attempted. No survey of mire vegetation exists for more than a part of one of the Fennoscandian countries, except for the work by 0kland (1989a) treating species distribution and hydromorphology of mires.",

The absence of this species from ombrotrophic parts of Roshultmyren (Olausson 1957) supports the view that Narthecium is a fen plant all over SE Fennoscandia where it occurs. Contrasting opinions have been expressed on the relationship of Carex pauciflora to the mineral soil water limit (e.g. Eurola 1962; Dierssen 1982) . All available evidence (cf. Sjors 1948 Sjors , 1950 Malmer 1962a; Svensson 1965; BackCus 1985; Bkland 1989b) . points to Carex pauciflora as the most frequently occurring and the most tolerant relict among the fen plants, but establishment of the species in ombrotrophic sites has not been demonstrated. Waldheim (1939) claims Sphagnum molle to occur in bogs in SW Gotaland, and Flatberg & Moen (1972) mention possible bog sites in Norway.

The most restricted distribution in bogs is shown by Eriophorum angustifolium, occurring in a few bogs in south-westernmost Sweden, mostly as sterile relicts (Olausson 1957; Svensson 1965) . Myrica gale even occurs on bogs in W Dalsland (Sjors 1953) , and is not infrequent in bogs in SW Gotaland (Olausson 1957) . Erica tetralix (and the other species of this group) is frequent to abundant on the bog expanse in SW Gotaland (Osvald 1923; Olausson 1957) . The northern limit of Erica retralix in bogs is in Vestfjella, inner 0stfold (0kland 1989a). Drosera intermedia shows a wider distribution in bogs towards SE Sweden, but is not recorded in bogs north of Store Mosse (Svensson 1965) . Sphagnum imbricatum ssp. austinii has a distribution not very different from Erica tetralix in bogs (cf. Flatberg 1986) . A much wider distribution in bogs is shown by Sphagnum papillosum. It appears to have a southern or south-western distribution of ombrotrophic occurrences, extending northwards to SW. Varmland (Fransson 1972) , a few sites in Bergslagen (Sjors 1948) , and is absent from SE Sweden (cf. Du Rietz 1950~). but has a few occurrences in wet sites in some south-western Finnish bogs (Aartolahti 1965 , Tolonen & Hosiaisluoma 1978 . The remaining three species show some differences in their distribution in bogs. Scirpus cespitosus is absent from bogs in SE Varmland (Fransson 1972) . and, like Rhynchospora alba and Drosera anglica, from SE and E Sweden. The northward extension of the three species in bogs in Sweden is not known exactly, but Scirpus cespitosus apparently shows no limit in its bog Occurrences (cf. Sjors 1947) . Rhynchospora alba may be restricted to fens in the middle boreal zone (Eurola & Vorren 1980; Sjors 1983; Moen 1987) . All species show an increase towards the southwest of Finland (Eurola 1962) . Rhynchospora alba is the most, and Drosera anglica the least restricted of the three species in Finland (Eurola 1962) .",

The three first mentioned species occur in bogs all over S Finland (Eurola 1962; Tolonen & Hosiaisluoma 1978 ) while the two Sphagnum species have a southern and a southeastern limit, respectively (Eurola 1962) . In Sweden and Norway, all species apparently occur in bogs throughout the southern boreal zone (cf. Tab. 2). From data of Fransson (1972) and BackCus (1984) , Sphagnum lindbergii appears more restricted than S. majus (reaching Blangsmossen; Witting 1947) , again more restricted than Carex limosa and Scheuchzeria palustris, occurring on Komosse, Blangsmossen, Breafallsmossen and with a wider distribution, in SW Varmland (Osvald 1923; Du Rietz 1950a,b; Fransson 1972) .

Furthermore, the importance of mud-bottoms increases northwards (Ruuhijarvi 1960) .

Such species are Erica tetralix, Drosera intermedia, Narthecium ossifragum, Sphagnum molle, Odontoschisma sphagni, and Cornicularia aculeata. The most western species do not avoid high altitudes (cf. Bkland 1989a) . Calluna vulgaris and other hummock relicts (cf. Bkland 1989b), as well as the southern species Drosera anglica and Rhynchospora alba, also show a south-western distributional tendency in lawns in the area (apparent from Tab. 5). These are typical examples of the more south-western distribution of southern species in lawns than in carpets. Correspondingly, some northern carpet species (notably Carex limosa, Scheuchzeria palustris, Sphagnum annulatum and S. lindbergii) show a northeastern distribution in lawns (Tab. 5). Northeastern species are Eriophorum medium and E. russeolum. Northern species in lawns are Betula nana (Sjors 1948; Fransson 1972) , Vaccinium microcarpum, Ptilidium ciliare (Sjors 1947; Eurola & Vorren 1980) , Cetraria delisei (Fransson 1972; Bkland 1989a) , and Cladonia subfurcata (Hasselrot 1953; Bkland 1989a) . A strong tendency for hummock species like Chamaedaphne calyculata, Empetrum nigrum s. l., Ledum palustre, Vaccinium uliginosum, Sphagnum angustifolium, and S. fuscum, to enter lawns in the less humid eastern (northeastern) parts of Finland is apparent from Tab. 5.",

The RLI subseries shows a strongly western distribution. Vegetation of this kind is described from N Finland (parts of the \"Sphagnum compactum-Weissmoore\" of Ruuhijarvi 1960) . In the MB zone of N Sweden, the R subseries is dominant in the lower lawn series (cf. Sjors 1947; Fransson 1963; Bjorkback 1965; Sonesson 1970a) . In Bergslagen (the SB zone), vegetation of the RLI type is extremely rare (Sjors 1947; Fransson 1972; Backtus 1985) , but increases westwards to be the dominant vegetation type of smaller (or all) hollows in the humid upland areas around limes norrlandicus, close to the national border (Fransson 1972; Bkland 1989b) . Vegetation of this kind also occurs south of limes norrlandicus, but from the descriptions and area valuations of Osvald (1923) , Olausson (1957) , Malmer (1965) , and Svensson (1965) , it always appears to be a subordinate element in the superhumid south-western areas, despite the opposite opinion expressed by Waldheim (1944) and Fransson (1972) . Considerably higher importance is noted in the less humid upland mire Akhultmyren (Malmer 1962a) . Vegetation corresponding to the RLu subseries occurs all over Sweden up to the middle boreal zone (Fransson 1972) , but with low importance in the least humid eastern areas (Du Rietz 1950~; Fransson 1972) . In S Finland RLu vegetation (\"Sphagnum tenellum-Weissmoore\" of Eurola 1962) is restricted to the southwestern, humid parts of coastal S Finland (Eurola 1962) , and in Estland Sphagnum tenellum increases northwestwards with increasing humidity (Paasio 1939) . Vegetation of the P subseries occurs all over the studied area, but plays a minor role in middle boreal bogs (Sjors 1947 (Sjors , 1963 , at least outside Finland (cf. Ruuhijarvi 1960) . Higher importance of Sphagnum magellanicum and S. papillosum than S. tenellum even in bogs are noted for the southwestern parts of Sweden (Osvald 1923; Olausson 1957; Malmer 1962a; Svensson 1965 ). It appears that the P subseries gives way to the R subseries towards the west and north.",

In SW Sweden, Sphagnum magellanicum and S. rubellum share dominance in the PHI subseries, without any consistent geographical pattern of variation in bogs (Tab. 7). In the PHu subseries, Sphagnum rubellum, S. imbricatum, and S. fuscum may dominate. The latter shows a considerable northward increase (compare Waldheim & Weimarck 1943; Malmer 1962a; Osvald 1923; Svensson 1965) . Sphagnum magellanicum is rare Tab. 5 . Regional variation in the vegetation of the lawn (L) series. Columns refer to published data as explained in Tab 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 51 11 51 51 52 51 52 52 54 52 53 41 51 51 52 52 51 51 41 51 51 51 52 31 51 52 51 51 51 51 51 51 42 51 (8): Bkland 1989b (9): Fransson 1972 (10): Konmo 1980 (11) 1950). South-western distributions (variable, but often with western deflection) are shown by Erica tetralix, Hypnum ericetorum (Osvald 1923; Olausson 1957; Malmer 1965) , Leucobryum glaucum (cf. Malmer 1962a) , Sphagnum imbricatum ssp. austinii (Flatberg 1984) , Odontoschkma sphagni, Cornicularia aculeata (Back-Bus 1983) and perhaps also Cladonia floerkeana (cf. Osvald 1923; Bkland 1989a) . A southern tendency is shown by Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum and Vaccinium oxycoccos, replaced northwards by their close relatives E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and V. microcarpum (Tab. 7) . The hummock vegetation includes a prominent northern element. Betula nana appears in mire expanse hummocks in the SB zone (Sjors 1948; Fransson 1972) , and increases northwards (Fransson 1972; 0kland 1989a) . Similarly, Rubus chamaemorus, almost entirely confined to the Hu series in SkAne and S Smiland (Malmer 1962a) , increases northwards and eastwards. Northern lichens are Cladonia cyanipes, Cetraria cucullata, C. nivalk, Icmadophila ericetorum, and Ochrolechia frigida (Sjors 1950; Ruuhijarvi 1960; Bkland 1989a) . Towards the MB and NB zones, the amounts of crustose lichens on the hummock crests increase considerably (Sjors 1947) . The amount of lichens and Dicranum elongatum (dominant in the NB zone; Sonesson 1970a) increases towards the east within the northernmost zones, giving most species a NE tendency (Sonesson 1967) . Barbilophozia binsteadii appears in the MB zone, rapidly gaining dominance (Sjors 1947 (Sjors , 1950 Fransson 1963; Sonesson 1970a) . A northeastern species is Pinguicula villosa (cf. Melin 1917; Sonesson 1967) , while Sphagnum angustifolium and several ericaceous species (cf. p. 293) increase eastwards. A peculiar distribution in hummocks is shown by Sphagnum balticum, absent from western as well as eastern areas (Tab. 7).",

Water supply increases towards more humid areas (as well as northwards, owing to late spring, increasing amounts of snow, etc. (cf. Sjors 1948; 0kland 1989a) ). This affects the annual range of depth to the water table, strongly increasing towards less humid areas. This is apparent from a comparison of range estimates in normal years; 1&15 cm in oceanic, strongly humid areas (Green & Pearson 1968; Damman & Dowhan 1981) , 2&25 cm in humid areas (Malmer 1962a; Johansson 1974; 0kland 1989b) , and close to 50 cm in warm, continental areas (Clymo 1984) , where the input to the catotelm, the permanently waterlogged lower peat stratum, is lower. The aeration of the peat favours development of hummocks and development of forested bogs (Glaser & Janssens 1986; Bkland 1989a,b) . Furthermore, good aeration favours an oxidising environment, and a lower pH (Sparling 1967; Sonesson 1970b) .",

Methane gas bubbles are released to the surface through pores in the peat, the release mostly follows the same routes, causing redistribution of extruded peat near the orifices of the pores (cf.

This limit also defines the transition from the dominance of plateau raised bogs and kermi raised bogs to plane transitional mires. -0 mechanisms by which erosion occur are suggested by Olausson (1957) and 0kland (1989a); erosion by oversaturation and erosion by stagnation. The erosive power of water is strongest when the water table is close to the surface of the bottom layer. Thus the probability of erosion decreases with decreasing duration of water cover at the level of the bottom layer surface (Sjors 1947; Foster et al. 1983) , that is, from carpet to lawns. Above the limit between the lower and upper lawn series, the bottom layer is rarely covered with water (0kland 1989b), and in N Kisselbergmosen (situated in a moderately humid area), patches of bare, eroded peat rarely occurs. Erosive action of water is particularly important at extremely high water tables (Backtus 1985) , as demonstrated by Osvald (1923) and Vorren (1979~) . Furthermore, the erosive power of water is highest at high water through-flow rates, as shown by Aario (1932) .",

Temperature has important effects on the water table and on water supply. Lower temperature leads to increased snow accumulation, later snow-melt in spring, higher surface runoff rates, and high water tables far into summer (Sjors 1947 (Sjors , 1948 Bkland 1989a) . Low temperatures lead to increased solubility of oxygen (Sjors 1961) and in turn to a surplus of oxygenated melt water in spring that favours surface corrosion (Sjors 1961 (Sjors , 1983 , and thus, erosion. 0kland (1989a) found the lower limit of sharply demarcated kermis, his borderline (l), and thus the lower limit of kermi raised bogs, to be almost perfectly correlated with the effective temperature sum. This limit is actually the southern and lower limit of important regelation effects (Aario 1932; Eurola 1962; Bkland 1989a) . The impact of regelation increases strongly northwards (Tanttu 1915; Auer 1920; Ruuhijarvi 1960; Sjors 1983 ), leading to an increased kermi-hollow differential and a stabilization of depressions (Sjors 1947) . The effects of ice pressure and ice erosion are strongest in carpets, and decrease towards lawns (Malmer 1962a; 0kland 1989b) . Regelation occurs in autumn and spring. Aartolahti (1965) describes how small tussocks are elevated by frost upheaval in the autumn, and how they sink in spring as the ice thaws, leaving a small ring of bare peat behind around the tussock.",

Water supply is the determinant of more important hydrological borders of SE Fennoscandian mires, as studied in detail by Bkland (1989a) . The most important of these is his borderline (2), the limit for soligenous water supply. Soligenous water supply is favoured by high humidity (Sjors 1948) , low temperatures, large amounts of snow, late springs and large amounts of melting water far into the summer (Ruuhijarvi 1983; Eurola & Holappd 1985) . This borderline is most strongly influenced by humidity in oceanic areas, approaching the E-W direction of variation, and by temperature in continental areas, there aligning more to the S-N direction. The presence of soligenous water is a necessary condition for development of unilaterally sloping bogs (Sjors 1948) . As the volume of seepage water conveyed through each point along the lower perimeter of a unilaterally sloping bog is far higher than in a multilaterally sloping bog of comparable size (cf. Damman 1986) . this limit marks a fundamental limit also in bogs. The limit of dominance of sloping fens over bogs (borderline 4) of Bkland (1989a) follows his borderline (2), but is displaced towards west and north.",

The variation is restricted to the western and northern areas, while an impoverishment gradient runs from NW to SE in the direction of reduced water supply. Very similar trends in phytogeographic variation within a smaller area, are reported by Bkland (1989a) . The higher proportion of western, suboceanic species in lawns than in carpets and hummocks, particularly in the lower lawn series (Malmer 1962a , Bkland 1989b . and the fact that such species are almost restricted to this series near their eastern limit, suggest that this species group prefers strong, periodic fluctuations of the water table. The decisive factor may be the frequent occurrence of reducing conditions, coupled with waterlogging (Malmer 1962a; Persson 1962; Boatman 1983) . The associated accumulation of metallic cations (Bkland 1989b, cf. p. 00) may be toxic to many species (as shown for Emperrum @rum by Bell & Tallis (1974) , and for Cafluna vufguris by Bannister (1964) ).

High decomposition rates in the waterair interface give rise to a strongly humified peat with small pores and tightly bound water (Andrus 1986 ; supported by observations by Bkland (1989b) ). When the water table is lowered, the hollows dry out. The typical lawn species, Sphagnum tenellum and S. balticum, share with S. fallax a low desiccation resistance, and a high desiccation tolerance (Wagner & Titus 1984; Rydin 1985; Andrus 1986 ). Desiccation resistance, or ability to capillary rise of water depends on the arrangement of pendant branches and leaves (Clymo & Hayward 1982; Rydin 1985) . The reciprocal distribution of Sphagnum tenellum and S. balticum may be explained by (1) the poorer capacity of water transport in the former (Rydin 1985) , due to the lack of differentiated hanging branches and the spreading, ovate leaves, and (2) the higher water content needed for net photosynthesis in S . tenellum (Rydin & McDonald 1985b) . Furthermore, the periodic drought increases the danger of periodic temperature limitation of photosynthesis (Rydin 1984) .",

The seasonal variation in depth to the water table influences the. hummocks indirectly by its effects on water availability. Higher water availability in humid areas, combined with higher growth rates in the favourable temperature climate of the south, is likely to be the reason for the SW-NE direction of variation among the bottom layer dominants. Sphagnum magellanicum and S. rubellum have higher growth rates than S. fuscum at lower relative levels in the same climate (Rydin & McDonald 1985a; Walltn et al. 1988 ), a fact easily explaining replacement along the regional moisture gradient. Furthermore, the superior ability of Sphagnum fuscum for capillary rise of water (Silvola & Aaltonen 1984; Rydin 1985) makes this species the only dominant of hummocks in continental areas. Structural properties are decisive in this respect (Hayward & Clymo 1983) .",

Commensalism with S. fuscum enables S. balti-cum to grow in hummocks in the intermediate area; surrounded by S. fuscum the species gets sufficient moisture to keep pace with the upward growth of the S. fuscum sward. However, in the southwest S. fuscum is reduced to a minor component of tall hummocks, too dry for S. balticum, while the competitive species S. rubellum and S. magellanicum, with their looser growth form, partly outcompete S. balticum and partly fail to give S. balticum sufficient water supply.

The higher importance of regelation processes in carpets explains the NW deflection of the mud-bottom importance gradient. Both the P and the R subseries (and all transitions and intermediates) occur in all series all over SE Fennoscandia. As shown by Malmer (1962a) and Bkland (1989b) differences along local gradients cannot explain the P-R differentiation. The geographic differentiation therefore must be ascribed to increased probability of substitution of the P by the R type of vegetation along the gradient. I will examine this hypothesis, series by series.",

Furthermore, very wet conditions are suboptimal for Sphagnum, as assumed by von Post & Sernander (1910 ), Osvald (1923 , Aario (1932), and Boatman (1983) . Apart from the abiotic factors, this is due to competition from algae. Sjors (1961 Sjors ( , 1963 Sjors ( , 1965 suggests that active algal growth restricts the growth of Sphagnum, and considers the competitive ability of algae to increase with increasing humidity. Support for the importance of this factor, and its increased action west-and nortwards comes from experimental studies: dominant bog hollow algae endure variable temperatures, low pH and desiccation (Hosiaisluoma 1975) , and the algal growth potential for two most important species of green algae is higher in bogs than in poor fens (Tolonen & Hosiaisluoma 1978) . The northward increasing algal production due to better oxygenation of meltwater is considered as an important factor for the northwestern distribution of hollow-pools (0kland 1989a).",

Dynamic and structural properties explain the increase of the RL subseries towards the southwest and the west. The probability of local catastrophic events increases with increasing humidity (p. 303). The slightly peat-producing Sphagna are pioneer species with a well documented ability to colonize bare patches, patches dominated by hepatics (0kland 1989b, 1990b) , periodically dry mud flats dominated by Zygogonium ericetorum (Osvald 1923) , and bare, slimy peat produced by burning (Ratcliffe & Walker 1958) . The westward increase in the amounts of hepatics suggests a higher tolerance of the R Sphagna to overgrowth by hepatics. 0kland (19Wb) assumes that Sphagnum tenellum is a less suitable substrate for the poikilohydric hepatics than most other Sphagnum species because of its very low desiccation resistance, among the lowest among the common Sphagna (Rydin 1985; Rydin & McDonald 1985b) . The very dense cushions of Sphagnum compactum and S. molle may be disadvantageous because of the danger of burial. The desiccation tolerances of Sphagnum balticum, S. compactum, S. molle, and S. tenellum are high, they even occur in xeric and sub-xeric heaths (Clymo & Hayward 1982; pers. obs. in humid W Norway).",

The assimilation rate of lichens increases with increasing thallus moisture content (Kershaw & Rouse 1971; Kershaw 1972) , and lichens dry out very rapidly (Blum 1973) . This explains the much lower annual production rates measured by Vasander (1981) in Finland than by Prince (1974) in humid Scotland. Lichens apparently do not easily invade a hummock dominated by healthy Sphagnum, because of lower growth rates. However, the physical and chemical conditions produced by Sphagnum appear to promote growth of leafy hepatics (Clymo & Hayward 1982) . Hepatics are ectohydric and poikilohydric (Buch 1947; Hosokawa et al. 1964) . Their distribution and local abundance are governed by the microclimate (Buch 1947; During 1979) . Mire hepatics are considered to have a low drought tolerance (Clausen 1952; Proctor 1982) . This explains the increase of this group westwards. The growth rate of Sphagnum fuscum declines strongly with increasing admixture of Mylia anomala (Pakarinen 1978) . Thus, the increasing importance of hepatics towards more humid climates increases the probability of reducing the growth rates of the dominating Sphagnum spp. below that of the lichens of Cladonia subg. Cladina. Similarly, the northward increase of chionophobous lichens is due to an increasing probability of wind abrasion of hummock crests, desiccating or killing the Sphagnum spp. and laying the hummocks open for invasion by lichens. Gjaerevoll 1966; Hengeveld & Haeck 1981) . This improvement of conditions towards the central parts of the range may be mediated by superior competitive ability aspects Of the differentiation into vegetation complexes",

The increasing danger of severe drought may restrict Scirpus cespitosus, Rhynchospora alba, and Drosera anglica to fens beyond their southeastern limits for bog occurrences. The restriction of the northern bog species (termed limnobionts by Miiller (1973 Miiller ( ,1976 ) to carpets, and the established relationship between the distribution of carpets and water supply (p. 303), explain the distribution of such species. This gains support from the coincidence of distributional limits with the limit of unilaterally sloping bogs, and the restriction of these species to large, wet hollows in the downslope, wetter parts of large bogs at their southernmost outpost localities (cf.

Several mechanisms have been put forward: (a) Increasing precipitation towards more humid climates leads to increasing surface water flow rates and better nutrition, thus simulating minerotrophic conditions (Aletsee 1967; Miiller 1976; Lindsay et al. 1985) . Miiller (1973) points to the improved nutrient availability when oxygen supply is improved by lateral water movement. Olausson (1957) points to the occurrences of Eriophorum angurtifolium downslope in unilaterally sloping bogs in the west, where the water throughflow rates are high. (b) The importance of high, relatively constant water tables for the occurrence of species like Eriophorum angustifolium, Narthecium ossifragum, and Rhynchospora alba in bogs (Malmer 1986 ). This hypothesis comes close to hypothesis (3) here. (c) The higher mineralization rate in southwestern bogs (Aletsee 1967; Dierssen 1982) . The high humidity of the southwest leads to high water tables, disfavouring decomposition. However, stagnation acts the opposite way, by reducing input to the acrotelm. By erosion, water tables are lowered sufficiently much to give considerably increased remineralization rates. N o evidence points to the restriction of the species in question to eroded bogs.",

In bogs and slightly minerogenous fens this regional variation is mainly related to the depth to the water table, its characteristic levels and seasonal course, and the danger of water erosion and intensity of regelation processes. This affects the distribution of species (0kland 1989a), the relative competitive abilities of different species in different habitats (0kland 1990b), and the stability of the habitat.

(2) The water supply, the main single factor affecting the hydrology and hydromorphology of mires in this area, increases from SE to NW, creating a stronger diversity of mire habitats in the west and north (0kland 1989a). (3) The southeastern phytogeographic element does not contain species of bogs and poor mires (0kland 1989a).

The present study points to the conceptual advantages of separating the humidity-oceanicity factor complex from the temperature complex, as strongly recommended by Ahti et al. (1968) , and practiced in regional mire studies by Vorren (1979a Vorren ( , 1979c and Eurola & Vorren (1980) . The concepts of regional subformations of Du Rietz (1949) should be replaced by a framework of types allowing for recognition of variation along both main regional gradients.",

This is excellently shown by the dominant Sphagnum spp., S. fuscum, S. magellanicum, and S. rubellurn, regardless of distributional tendency, and by several dwarf shrubs.",

Sjars 1948; Korsmo 1980) and east (Tab. 7). Sphagnum rubellurn is the dominant species in the PHI bog vegetation in moderately humid areas farther north and east (0kland 1989b: R b . 31; Backkus 1972, 1984; Fransson 1972). In this zone, Sphagnum fuscurn is the only dominant in the PHu series. Within short distances, S. fuscurn gains dominance in PHI as well, while S. rubellurn is reduced to a subordinate species (Backkus 1984; cf. also Sjors 1948; Du Rietz 1950b,c; Eurola 1962).From Tab. 7, it appears that the importance of hepatics increases westwards, (material from Finland dis-refer to constancy class and characteristic degree of cover.",

Patches dominated by hepatics are noted from most areas, but very few investigations of such vegetation have been conducted. From the material of Eurola (1962), it is evident that hepatics are exceedingly unimportant in S Finland as compared to N. Kisselbergmosen, SW Varmland (Fransson 1972), and Akhultmyren (Malmer 1962a). In Finland, the maximum importance of hepatics is reached in the southwestern areas Nord. J. Bot. 10 (3) (1990) (Paasio 1933; Eurola 1962). Dominance relationships among the lichen species cannot be deduced from the available data.Tab. 6.
