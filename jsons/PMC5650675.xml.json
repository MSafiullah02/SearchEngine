A smart card (also called chip card or integrated circuit card) is a pocket-sized plastic card embedded with integrated circuits, allowing for individual identification, security authentication, data storage, and application processing in a wide variety of settings, including banking, retail business, bill payment, transportation, custom control, and educational settings [16]. In recent years, smart card technology\u2013based systems are increasingly being adopted for various administration purposes in all levels of local educational institutions. In this respect, the situation in Hong Kong offers an unprecedented opportunity for assessing whether these automated data collection approaches in a school setting may offer the potential to contribute to more timely and efficient disease surveillance. In a previous pilot study, we demonstrated the feasibility of employing smart card\u2013based technology to capture school absenteeism data for surveillance purposes [17]. Here, we report further details on the implementation and feasibility of building a comprehensive system for prospective ILI surveillance among a representative network of local primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. On the basis of smart card technology, the system was being utilized to track absence from school, supplemented with additional back end systems for the automation of all subsequent steps required in the surveillance process, including a process to capture the reasons for absence.",

The CHP prospectively monitors a number of data streams from different networks of surveillance partners covering different population subsectors. Sentinel doctors\u2019 networks included some 50 general practitioners (GPs) in private practice, 65 general outpatient clinics, and sentinel Chinese medicine practitioners in selected clinics, each reporting the proportions of patient consultations having ILI (a body temperature of 38.0\u00b0C plus cough or sore throat) on a weekly basis. Other additional systems included child care centers and kindergartens reporting children suffering from fever or cough and residential care homes for the elderly reporting inmates having fever [19]. For primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, however, a mechanism does not exist for the prospective monitoring of ILIs besides the passive reporting of any confirmed or suspected outbreaks. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, most schools in Hong Kong have required parents to monitor body temperature of their children every day and to abstain from sending them to school when having a fever, making absenteeism a suitable proxy for disease surveillance [20]. Many schools in Hong Kong now use smart cards rather than verbal roll call to track attendance at school because of convenience and efficiency.",

On a daily basis, a list of absent students would be displayed automatically on the user interface of the system in each school for easy checking. In some participating schools, the specific causes of absence were then individually ascertained by telephone call and manually recorded into the system in free text format by designated school staff. In our updated surveillance system, a simple drop-down menu was added to the user interface (Figure 3) to allow for easy and standardized reporting of common causes of absence, such as ILI; gastroenteritis; hand, foot and mouth disease; acute conjunctivitis; other illnesses with specification; or non-sickness-related absence, to facilitate the capturing of these more specific data.",

All participating schools received a system update of their eClass system, with a training session offered to responsible staffs for operating the updated system interface. Besides data submission using the updated system interface as detailed above, no additional workload was imposed on school staffs. A telephone hotline was also maintained by our staff to answer any queries and offer technical assistance that may be needed. With the newly developed system, daily absenteeism data from all participating schools were collected for 2 academic years from September 2012 to June 2014; each academic year starts in September and finishes in June of the subsequent year in Hong Kong, covering a total of four seasonal influenza epidemics locally (two winter and two summer epidemics). In general, the system took around 3 to 4 working days from data capturing to information dissemination. The longest time lag was the lag of 2 to 3 days between data submission and completion of data analysis, mainly to wait for data from all schools to be submitted. Reporting of all-cause absenteeism data was complete (100%) by all 107 participating schools reported. The number of schools reporting ILI-specific absenteeism data using the drop-down menu was initially only 13 (12.1%, 13/107) when they were first recruited, which increased to 38 (35.5%, 38/107) by the end of the project.",

Figure 6 shows the temporal patterns of all-cause and ILI-specific school absenteeism rates in relation to two other sources of surveillance data, including the proportion of ILI patients among general outpatient consultations in the existing sentinel GP surveillance network [19] and positive influenza detection rate from hospital samples. Generally, the rate of school absenteeism varied over the course of 2 years, with four periods of elevated absence over the study period that corresponded well with seasonal influenza activity as reflected by the laboratory detection data. Compared with data from the sentinel GP network, the rise, peak, and fall of influenza epidemic activities were much better delineated by the temporal trends reflected by either the all-cause or ILI-specific absenteeism rate. Two of the four epidemic peaks matched exactly temporally with the GP data. The remaining two peaks (early 2013 and early 2014), shown by the school-based surveillance, occurred 1 to 2 weeks before the peaks shown by the GP data. Result of cross-correlation analysis revealed that the maximum correlation occurred with a 3-week lag with the test data preceding the reference data, both between the ILI-specific absenteeism and laboratory data (Max CCC=.434 at lag=3) and between the ILI specific absenteeism and the GP data (Max CCC=.311 at lag=3). These observations agreed with our previous finding from the pilot study that epidemic peaks demonstrated by the school-based surveillance system can precede those shown by the sentinel GP network by 1 to 3 weeks [17].",

Our system is designed to support the various functions of an information infrastructure needed to support pandemic response as detailed in the PROSPER protocol. The continuous baseline surveillance data collected in a stable and standardized manner in interpandemic times can help to inform the CNA and RDM functions. The customizability of the system helps to calibrate detection algorithms in the CNA function with regard to the new pathogen and epidemic.

Different Web-based approaches to facilitate data reporting were tried in previous disease surveillance studies, including a short-term system built for special events [22] and an adjunct system during the 2009 evolving pandemic [11]. Workload minimization, however, was not always achievable in practice, especially when an unfamiliar approach was being introduced in a new system. A recent school absenteeism surveillance system employing mobile devices and Web-based platforms for data reporting had poor acceptability and sustainability as a result of the extra workload required outside the normal daily routine of teachers [15]. Later attempts to use fingerprint scanning for automatic attendance data capture were also not successful as a result of the technical difficulty for a significant number of students to be accurately scanned by the system [15].",

This may also affect the generalizability of the results to places where illness absenteeism practice are different because of local cultural or socioeconomic factors. Second, the ascertainment of the cause of absence still has to be done though a manual process. As a result of the additional workload implication, cause-specific absence data were only captured by a portion of schools in our system. This could be mitigated in future by enhancing the system to collect information from parents, for example, by sending an email or SMS text messaging (short service message, SMS) to parents to notify them of their child\u2019s absence and requesting them to provide a reason, with options such as ILI given.

The absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community and we were able to detect an upsurge in its disease activity in a more timely manner than other existing surveillance data. As we previously demonstrated that the alerting of the onset of an epidemic can be greatly enhanced in terms of sensitivity and timeliness by the monitoring of multistream surveillance data [23], our absenteeism data is potentially useful for supplementing existing systems in Hong Kong for monitoring the trend of influenza disease activity in the community. With the increasing popularity of smart card\u2013based electronic health record systems in different health care utilization settings [24,25], it offers an unprecedented potential for novel surveillance and risk monitoring systems to be developed based on this technology [26]. Our experience would be referential for other countries and cities facing a similar problem and in need of improving their existing surveillance systems, particularly in showing how this can be achieved by suitably and creatively adapting to an existing system.",
