Following a traumatic event many individuals return to previous functioning and some feel an increased sense of efficacy. However, a sizable minority experience adverse psychological and behavioral effects. These effects include distress reactions, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disorders. Workplace traumatic events and responses most studied in physicians include exposure to injured and dying patients, medical errors and complications, bullying, disasters, and workplace violence. Developmental issues confer specific risks for medical students and residents, as well as early and late career physicians. Prevention measures which reduce exposure to workplace trauma are optimal. Physicians exposed to traumatic events will benefit from the use of prompt, evidence-based interventions. Many will seek and benefit from self-help interventions and peer support, but some may need formal assessment and treatment through employee assistance programs and traditional psychiatric care. Effective prevention and treatment can enhance physician well-being and career retention as well as patient outcomes.",

From the beginning of medical education when students first lay eyes on cadavers through their later years as seasoned physicians, the very nature of medicine is to come closer to death and serious injury than the rest of society. Physicians also experience traumatic events such as workplace violence at rates higher than most occupations. When natural and man-made disasters occur, hospitals and physicians bear the brunt of caring for those injured and sickened. Significant literature exists on the impact of traumatic events and disaster on individuals and populations. Evidence suggests that physicians experience witnessing injury and death differently and employ different methods of coping. Strategies to mitigate stress and distress due to work-associated trauma should take into account these differences. For this reason, any discussion of physician health and mental well-being must include how physicians experience traumatic events and their immediate and persisting effects.",

            "text": "In order to understand work-associated trauma, it is first necessary to properly define terms. Medical and other literature liberally use the terms trauma and traumatized to describe a broad range of stressful life events including traumatic events, stressors, and adversity. More significantly, there is a tendency to blur the boundary between events and reactions. From a diagnostic and research perspective, it is useful to be more precise and circumscribed in defining trauma. Trauma, derived from the Greek word meaning \"wound,\" in its simplest definition is a physical or mental injury. The diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) describe traumatic events as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence through direct experience, witnessing, or repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details (DSM-5, 2013) . Traumatic events are defined by these characteristics, whether or not the individual goes on to develop symptoms. Traumatic stress refers to the range of distress responses, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disorders that can occur in response to traumatic events. Stressors are defined as external stimuli that disrupt the equilibrium of an individual. Adversity refers to longer-term, sociological and community-based negative stressors that affect individuals or groups. For the purposes of this chapter we will discuss a broad range of stressors and adversity that lead to psychological responses, most of them will be traumatic events.",

Most individuals exposed to traumatic events will emerge with limited or no adverse effects, promptly and effectively resuming their social and occupational roles (resilience). Some may even experience an increased sense of competence, self-efficacy, and belief in their ability to manage future stressors (often termed \"posttraumatic growth\"). However, a sizable minority will experience a range of adverse psychological and behavioral effects, including distress reactions, health risk behaviors, and psychiatric disorders (see Fig. 2 .1). Following a traumatic event, distress reactions are most common. Individuals often feel anger and vulnerability. A loss of faith and demoralization may also occur. Many individuals experience insomnia, irritability, and feelings of distractibility (Rundell and Ursano 1996) . Some individuals display physical symptoms as a manifestation of psychological distress, ultimately presenting to healthcare settings. Somatic complaints such as headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and weakness are common in the wake of a traumatic event, even when an identifiable physical disorder cannot be found (Ford 1997) . Most who seek care present to primary care and emergency settings. An awareness of distress reactions as a frequent consequence of traumatic events is important for primary care and emergency providers to avoid misattribution of these symptoms to other medical causes, ultimately delaying definitive care.",

The course of PTSD varies, though intentional acts of violence often result in escalating symptoms over time (see Fig. 2 .2). PTSD is not the only trauma-related disorder, nor perhaps the most common (Fullerton and Ursano 1997) .

For many, initial exposure to death and injury is a traumatic event, but the expected outcome of graduated exposure to death and injury is to produce resilient physicians. Most physicians' first exposure to death and the dead occurs early in medical education in the gross anatomy laboratory. Research indicates many students experience anxiety during dissections (Grochowski et al. 2014 ), but gradually accommodate to being around cadavers, with decreasing rates of symptoms such as intrusive imagery between the first and second semesters of medical school (Bob et al. 2014) . Other aspects of medical education can generate distress in students and are worth noting. Students experience significant distress related to personal feelings, interpersonal dynamics, and their relationship to patients' suffering or death during simulation in medical education (Pai et al. 2014) .",

In a survey of 113 surgeons, one in five reported symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis, and two-thirds exhibited some symptoms. This was independent of the amount of exposure to surgical trauma patients (Warren et al. 2013) . Oncologists experience the death of patients on a frequent basis as a traumatic event. In his book The Emperor of all Maladies, Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee captured his experience of this by writing, \"In the parking lot of the hospital, a chilly, concrete box lit by neon floodlights, I spent the end of every evening and the end of rounds in stunned incoherence, the car radio crackling vacantly in the background, as I compulsively tried to reconstruct the events of the day. The stories of my patients consumed me, and the decisions that I made haunted me\" (Mukherjee 2011) . In this environment, some individuals develop coping mechanisms that ultimately reduce their experience of distress. However, coping mechanisms that involve numbing, avoidance, or shutting off emotions can result in decreased empathy, potentially impairing a physician's ability to provide adequate patient care (McFarland and Roth 2016) .",

Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States (Makary and Daniel 2016) and have the potential to occur in every specialty and every setting. The term \"second victim\" has been used to describe physicians involved in medical errors and complications (Wu 2000) . Scott et al. performed an in-depth analysis of 31 \"second victim\" physicians who indicated developing symptoms consistent with PTSD. These physicians recalled distressing aspects of the event in extraordinary detail many years later, reported ruminative thoughts about the event that adversely affected work and sleep, and experienced abrupt emotional recollection of the event when confronted by triggers such as a patient with a similar name or performing the same procedure in the same location (Scott et al. 2009 ). A study of critical care personnel who committed medical errors identified symptoms of guilt (53.8%), shame (42.5%), and anxious rumination (37.5%) (Laurent et al. 2014) . Other symptoms following medical errors include anxiety about future potential errors (52%), loss of confidence in abilities as a physician (45%), and sleep disruption (36%) (McLennan et al. 2015) . Surgical disciplines experience similar rates, with 53% of surgeons reporting an adverse patient event in the last year as a traumatic event (Hu et al. 2012) . Malpractice cases can be another source of continuing stress with 25% of 7164 surgeons reporting a lawsuit within the past 24 months, which was associated with burnout, depression, and suicidal thoughts (Balch et al. 2011) . In an effort to cope, physicians may turn to risky behaviors. In a 1991 survey, Wenokur and colleagues identified increased alcohol use among 11% of physicians sued for malpractice. Fifty-four percent of the affected physicians considered their ability to care for patients compromised but only 6% sought any type of mental health treatment (Wenokur and Campbell 1991) .",

There is limited literature specifically looking at physician responses to traumatic events related to disasters, but much can be extrapolated from general disaster literature. Physician disaster responders may be exposed to mass death and injury, grotesque and disturbing sensory input, and extreme distress in those identified as patients. First responders are at increased risk for a range of adverse mental health effects, such as PTSD (Morganstein et al. 2016) .

Distress reactions, such as sleep difficulties and decreased perceptions of safety, are common, as well as psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and depression.

Those who lack adequate training, such as Basic Life Support, may have doubt or anxiety about stepping forward to participate in these events. Feelings of guilt may result from a physician or trainee's inadequate response or lack of response in the aftermath of a disaster. This can include withholding care due to excessive demand or inadequate resources to offer intervention that they would otherwise offer under normal circumstances. Disasters differentially impact children and other vulnerable populations, and thereby expose healthcare workers to a greater number of serious injuries or deaths in children.

These include chemical, radiological, and infectious exposures in the course of routine medical care and disaster response. Exposure to occupational hazards appears to lead to increased somatic symptoms (Somville et al. 2016 ). Physicians may be most threatened by infectious diseases they are called on to treat. Codes of medical ethics have historically recognized this risk, \"When pestilence prevails, it is [the physicians'] duty to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation of the suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives\" (AMA Code of Medical Ethics 1847). Some contemporary infectious diseases generate significant anxiety in physicians due to their virulence and devastating implications of infection. Diseases such as HIV have the potential to generate significant traumatic stress in treating physicians, particularly those that find themselves exposed. Highly transmissible and deadly agents such as Ebola, Marburg, and SARS are not only lethal to those infected, they also represent a threat to healthcare workers. In the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015, 3% of more than 27,000 cases and 5% of more than 11,000 deaths were healthcare workers (Mulligan and Siebert 2015) . Even though these numbers were highly concentrated in African countries, Europe and the United States also experienced cases of transmission to healthcare workers. Vignette 2 captures the experience of nurses exposed to an infectious Ebola patient in 2014. Influenza is another pathogen that poses risk to healthcare workers with the potential for generating psychological trauma. In one study of healthcare workers exposed to H1N1 influenza during the 2009 epidemic, up to 1 in 3 emergency room workers became infected with the virus (Sandoval et al. 2016) . Physicians and other personnel may respond to this perceived threat by calling in sick or overtly refusing to attend work, further diminishing an already overstressed healthcare workforce during a time of increased care demands. N-95s , and face shields. Some supervisors said that even the N-95 masks were not necessary. The suits they were given still exposed their necks, the part closest to their face and mouth. They had suits with booties and hoods, three pairs of gloves, no tape. For their necks, nurses had to use medical tape, that is not impermeable and has permeable seams, to wrap around their necks in order to protect themselves, and had to put on the tape and take it off on their own.\"",

A variety of social, cultural, and economic changes in the delivery of healthcare parallel increased rates of violence toward physicians (Shi et al. 2015; WHO 2002) . Among Pakistani physicians surveyed about their experiences over the past 12 months, one in six reported a physical attack and 60% reported verbal abuse. Among those, 40% screened positive for anxiety and depression on the Global Health Questionnaire-12 and one in six were positive for PTSD using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian, with physical attacks being the most significant predictor of PTSD (Zafar et al. 2016) . Studies looking at workplace violence to date have been directed toward quantifying the problem and less directed to understanding the sources and underlying risks (Phillips 2016) . Table 2 .2 summarizes a useful differentiation of types of workplace violence according to the relationships between the perpetrator, the workplace, and the victim.

Verbal violence can range from insulting or demeaning remarks directed toward a healthcare worker to direct threats of physical violence. Physical violence occurs along a spectrum ranging from unwanted contact or striking by (Kowalenko et al. 2013 ). In a 2011 study of U.S. emergency medicine residents and staff, 78% of emergency physicians reported some type of workplace violence in the last year. Of these events, 75% involved verbal threats, and 21% involved physical assault by a patient (Behnam et al. 2011) . Commonly cited causes of violence in healthcare settings include delays in consultations and/or care, intoxication, and psychiatric disorders (Belayachi et al. 2010) . Though patientinitiated violence is the most often researched in emergency settings, some literature suggests rates of violence by patients' relatives may be even higher (Ayranci 2005) . Nurses and other health professions are even more susceptible. In 2013, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recorded over 7000 violent injuries that resulted in days away from work for nursing aides and assistants, and almost 2000 violent injuries to registered nurses (OSHA 2015). In a survey of inpatient psychiatric nurses between 2011 and 2013 staff identified 3867 injurious assaults by patients against hospital staff, with a rate of 0.55 assaults per 1000 patient-days (Staggs 2015) . Physicians at all levels of training are potentially exposed to workplace assaults. In a comparison of medical students and social work students, medical students experienced higher levels of workplace violence while social work students received more education on methods to manage agitated patients (Ellwood and Rey 1996) .",

Acts of mass violence such as mass shootings, terrorist bombings, or other large scale attacks incorporate multiple characteristics that amplify their psychological impact. First, they are intentional acts which have a greater traumatic impact compared to natural or random events. Second, multiple victims will increase the number of individual traumatic events. Finally, victims tend to be innocent bystanders and therefore perceived by responders with greater identification and horror. Emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, and orthopedic surgeons describe caring for mass shooting victims as \"just like any normal day at a trauma center, but amplified\" and often struggle with compartmentalized emotions for years (Castellucci 2016) . Recent mass shootings both in and out of healthcare settings have captured public attention and generated significant anxiety and fear. Between 1980 and 1990, there were 78 workplace homicides by firearm, and 19 of these were physicians (Goodman et al. 1994 ). Kelen and colleagues reviewed media reporting of hospital shooting events between 2000 and 2011 and identified 154 hospital-related shootings, of which 91 occurred inside the hospital. Motives for shooting varied, including grudge (27%), suicide (21%), and euthanizing an ill relative (14%). In 45% of hospital shootings, the victim was the perpetrator, either self-inflicted or shot by security response (Kelen et al. 2012 ).",

Individuals most directly exposed are at greatest risk for psychiatric disorders after the trauma. In the disaster literature, the directly exposed group usually includes individuals most proximal to the disaster (North et al. 2002) , those who experienced physical danger, and those who directly witnessed traumatic events. In addition, individuals who have attachments with primary victims, first responders, and support providers are at greater risk (Wright and Bartone 1994) than \"detached\" bystanders. It is reasonable to extrapolate this to all traumatic events experienced by physicians, meaning that those closest to the scene and those with more emotional attachment to victims are more likely to experience traumatic stress reactions. Those who are injured during a traumatic event will typically experience more symptoms of traumatic stress. Gender plays a role, with men more likely to experience traumatic events, but women more likely to develop PTSD (Breslau et al. 1999) .",

This power differential leaves students vulnerable to mistreatment. Student mistreatment occurs along a spectrum from public humiliation to physical or sexual assault. In this regard, it is very similar to forms of interpersonal violence. Though advocacy for medical student well-being has increased in recent years, mistreatment or \"hazing\" of students often goes unreported, making true estimates of its frequency extremely difficult. The American Association of Medical Colleges reports the rate of student mistreatment around 17% (AAMC 2011). However, other studies of medical students in the USA and other countries have found reported rates to be much higher (Frank et al. 2006; Rautio et al. 2005) . A recent study found that 64 and 76% of medical students reported at least one incident of mistreatment by faculty and residents, respectively (Cook et al. 2014 ). Student mistreatment is extremely stressful for victims and confers increased risk for poor health outcomes and psychological symptoms. In a study of medical students during their clinical year at Brown University, Heru and colleagues observed that most students reported experiencing mistreatment or observing another student being mistreated (Heru et al. 2009 ). They also found more than half the students experiencing mistreatment reported Impact of Events Scale-Revised scores that exceeded the threshold for posttraumatic stress disorder. Students who are abused indicate these experiences have a significant effect on their specialty selection and career trajectory (Haviland et al. 2011) .",

As mentioned previously, gross anatomy teaching requires exposure to and dissection of deceased human remains. It is traditionally viewed as a rightof-passage and a milestone by which preclinical students begin the process of transitioning from layperson to physician by crossing the boundary of the human body. The dissection experience produces distress in about half of medical students (Sandor et al. 2015) . Fear of stigmatization and being perceived as unfit to serve as a physician prevent many students from talking about these reactions. During the dissection experience, identification with human remains (i.e., \"this could be my grandmother\") increases distress. Seeing the hands and face of the cadaver increases this effect. Exposing students to the least distressing body parts first and teaching students cognitive coping strategies may reduce adverse effects. Normalizing a range of emotional and physiologic reactions during dissection and encouraging open discussion of these reduces stigma and barriers to help seeking and promotes healthy peer interactions that become useful later in their medical careers.",

Ensuring \"adequate equipment\" and \"protection\" helps people feel safe going to work and doing their job. Firefighters check their protective equipment not just to make sure it works, but to increase their sense of personal safety when stressful events occur. Physicians' benefit from ensuring similar protections are in place through training and procedures to reduce perceptions of risk and increase feelings of safety. This allows them to spend less physical and mental energy concerned with personal well-being and more on the well-being of patients. This is just as true for first responders as for physicians charged with caring for others who may be harmed themselves. Prevention of trauma reduces morbidity for affected physicians and may limit adverse effects on patient care. Prevention involves recognizing high-risk characteristics of traumatic events, identifying at-risk physicians and system vulnerabilities, and taking mitigation steps that promote individual and organizational resilience (see Table 2 .3 and Chap. 11). Historical public health interventions are a useful paradigm to consider for efforts to prevent work-associated trauma in physicians. For instance, the advent of seat belts dramatically reduced the rate of injury in automobile accidents, thereby decreasing distress reactions, health risk behavior, and psychiatric disorders associated with them. Examination of human and system factors as well as specific vulnerabilities in healthcare settings and physician training programs can elucidate areas to target for intervention (see also Chap. 13).",

Communication marked by active listening, empathy, support, and a desire to help reduces feelings of fear and isolation. In this way, leaders can provide the initial support to physicians impacted by traumatic events, a critical element in reducing distress and promoting recovery (Brewin et al. 2000) . Another key aspect of this communication is that leaders convey to their organization that distress reactions are acceptable and that the group can and will support members through their distress. Leaders must also pay attention to their own distress reactions and health risk behaviors following traumatic events. Poor sleep, over-dedication to the point of exhaustion, or withdrawal from their leadership role will have a negative effect on coping within the workplace following traumatic events.

The effectiveness of EAP counselors and therapists in providing assessment is largely dependent upon their training, comfort, and being adequately resourced.

Any additional stressor can exacerbate the primary traumatic event, adding to a physician's burden of distress. Individuals will predominantly manifest distress reactions, health risk behaviors, and less frequently psychiatric disorders (see Fig. 2 .1). A focus exclusively on making a psychiatric diagnosis will often overlook a range of psychological and behavioral responses contributing to significant distress and functional impairment. Assessment can include a clinical interview as well as the use of standardized scales for trauma and comorbid illnesses (i.e., PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version, PHQ9 for depression, and AUDIT-C for alcohol consumption). Another consideration when assessing physicians following traumatic events should be a clear understanding of the intensity and duration of the physician's exposure to traumatic events. Knowing such details as the number of injuries treated, time spent stabilizing patients, and the nature of their injuries can provide clues as to the likelihood of a distress response down the road even if the physician reports no acute distress.

Other therapeutic interventions, such as Stress Inoculation Training and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing have also been found to be helpful in reducing symptoms of trauma. Trauma-focused psychotherapies incorporate imaginal exposure to the traumatic event in conjunction with an examination of cognitions the physician may have about aspects of the event and their meaning. Negative thoughts such as \"It's all my fault,\" \"If only I hadn't said something then this wouldn't have happened,\" and other distorted cognitions are examined in collaboration between the physician and their treating provider. Subsequently, alternative and more balanced thoughts are considered and eventually used to replace the distressing negative thoughts. Trauma-focused psychotherapies also incorporate real-world behavioral interventions to assist patients in overcoming avoidant behaviors. These psychotherapies reduce the full range of symptoms associated with disorders such as PTSD. They have also been found to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of early symptoms if delivered shortly after the trauma and prior to the development of a formal psychiatric disorder.",

            "text": "Pharmacotherapy following a traumatic event should generally be time-limited and symptom focused. Insomnia is a nearly universal symptom following a traumatic event. Because regulating sleep is critical to reducing arousal symptoms (and promoting the \"calming\" element of PFA), short-term sedative-hypnotic medication may be used to relieve insomnia. Eszopiclone (Lunesta) and Zolpidem (Ambien), both of which enhance GABA activity, are commonly prescribed for initiation insomnia. Prazosin (Minipress), an alpha-adrenergic blocker has demonstrated efficacy in treating insomnia associated with posttraumatic symptoms as well as reducing the frequency and severity of associated nightmares and may be used at doses up to 15 mg nightly. Physicians with comorbid depression may benefit from the sedating histamine properties of trazodone (Oleptro), originally developed as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of depression. Medication for sleep should be provided in conjunction with additional interventions to promote sleep hygiene and address the range of PFA principles. As with all interventions medication should be tailored to patient preference.",

These interventions are increasingly sought out by patients as alternatives to traditional biological interventions. Patients commonly report a desire for options that enhance selfefficacy and reduce the incidence of side effects as a rationale for using these modalities. Mindfulness practices have the most robust research base to support their efficacy. Mindfulness is the practice of purposefully focusing on what is happening in the present moment without passing judgment. It requires one to attend to thoughts, feelings, or sensations without resisting or trying to change them. This practice has generated increasing attention in the field of healthcare as an intervention to reduce the stress and anxiety linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Animal-assisted therapy has become increasingly popular in the management of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including those associated with traumatic stress as well as anxiety and other disorders. Animals may assist individuals who would otherwise be reluctant to engage in social activities following a traumatic event; thus, enhancing the critical treatment intervention of social support. Yoga, meditation, and acupuncture are additional alternatives that should be considered. Patient preference is an important determinant in considering whether to offer interventions currently considered complementary and alternative.",

In spite of increased awareness and understanding of mental health, stigma continues to serve as a barrier to help-seeking for physicians (Hu et al. 2012) . Stigma may be an internal phenomenon in which a physician's negative perception of help-seeking may lead them to avoid seeking care. Healthcare institutions can also foster a professional culture which stigmatizes the use of help-seeking resources. Subtle or overt messages from colleagues, supervisors, and the broader healthcare organization may signal judgment, mistrust, and a lack of confidence or professional esteem directed at those who use mental health or other help-seeking resources. Additional barriers include inadequate knowledge about available resources as well as lack of confidence in the efficacy of these resources. Concerns about confidentiality and adverse career impact are also commonly cited by physicians as reasons for which they avoid using helping resources.",
