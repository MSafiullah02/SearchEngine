Presumably, the way of life of felids has driven over time the development of viruses with highly efficient viral transmission strategies and the potential to induce chronic or latent infections, thus increasing carrier populations and viral dissemination (Pontier et al., 2009). It is today widely accepted that the initial antiviral immune response of the mammalian host plays an essential role in determining the outcome of viral infection. Although extensive studies have been carried out in mouse models, the antiviral innate immune system of the cat remains poorly understood, leaving open questions regarding initial responses to viral infection as well as the possibility of manipulating innate immune mechanisms in favour of the host. In order to illustrate the current status of research concerning innate antiviral defence mechanisms in cats, we will first give a short overview of general knowledge in this field.",

With respect to viruses, the host's intrinsic defence structures recognize mostly genomic nucleic acids and replication intermediates. Three main classes of PAMPs have emerged to date: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and unmethylated CpG DNA. In turn, the detection of these PAMPs relies on a limited set of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Three classes of PRR molecules seem to survey various cell compartments for presence of PAMPs and promote intrinsic antiviral immunity: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and the cytoplasmic viral DNA sensors (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010).",

Among the 12 TLRs in mice and 10 TLRs in humans that have been identified to date (Tabeta et al., 2004), three share the ability to bind nucleic acids, namely those expressed in endosomal compartments of various subsets of dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, upon phagocytic or endocytic events, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 can sense viral dsRNA, ssRNA or unmethylated CpG-DNA respectively (Vaidya and Cheng, 2003). TLR8, a structurally homologous variant of TLR7, seems to be non-functional in mice, but has been described in humans as recognising similar molecular patterns to TLR7 (Jurk et al., 2002). To date, various synthetic ligands have been identified for these TLRs, among which the most popular include Poly IC, a synthetic double-stranded polyriboinosinic\u2013polyribocytidylic acid, a well-known synthetic analogue to dsRNA and stimulator of TLR3 (Jiang et al., 2003); imidazoquinolines such as resiquimod (R-848), synthetic compounds that bind to TLR7/8 (Wagner et al., 1999); and synthetic CpG molecules, which trigger TLR9 (Vollmer et al., 2004). Such Toll-like receptor agonists have not only been used extensively for research purposes linked to the understanding of innate immune mechanisms, but have also gained much popularity in the clinical field, as treatments for various types of disease and as vaccine adjuvants (Meyer and Stockfleth, 2008, Seya and Matsumoto, 2009).",

            "text": "PAMP-triggered PRRs activate distinct signaling pathways that converge on the activation of specific transcription factors NF\u03baB, AP-1, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, enhancing the expression of both proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, and type I IFNs, the main players in eradication of replicating viruses in antiviral innate immunity (Schindler et al., 2007). In humans, the large family of type I IFNs primarily include IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03c9 (Bekisz et al., 2004). IFN\u03b1 consists of a group of 13 structurally related proteins, each encoded by a separate intronless gene, while only one protein each for IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03c9 have been characterized. Type I IFNs are produced by almost all cell types, with IFN\u03b2 being the main IFN secreted by fibroblasts in response to viral challenge. Essentially, the ubiquitous presence of IFN receptor complex composed of two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (Uze et al., 2007) and the pleiotropy of these cytokines enable IFNs to initiate potent antiviral responses. First, type I IFNs activate, in uninfected target cells, the production of intracellular effectors that can interfere with several steps of virus replication cycles. Well-studied examples of these antiviral proteins include myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx) GTPase, the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the interferon stimulated gene (ISG) 15 (mechanisms reviewed in Sadler and Williams, 2008). The Mx protein, for instance, binds to essential viral components thus blocking their intracellular transport (Haller et al., 2007). Moreover, production of this protein is widely recognized as a marker for upregulation of type I IFNs (Haller et al., 2007). Through positive feedback processes, type I IFNs were additionally shown to enhance the expression of TLRs, further sensitizing cells to microbial recognition (Siren et al., 2005). Finally, type I IFNs effectively bridge innate and adaptive immunity by promoting the differentiation and function of various immune cell populations such as DCs, NK cells, B cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (Colonna et al., 2004).",

Constitutively primed to kill, these cells rapidly release IFN\u03b3, a type II IFN affecting mainly adaptive immune cells, as well as granzyme and perforin, cytotoxic substances stored in cytosolic granules. Primary NK targets are host cells lacking MHC I molecules on their surface. As most viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate host cell MHC expression in order to avoid immune responses resulting from antigen presentation, virally infected cells are readily attacked by NK cells. In addition to type I IFNs, IL-15 was shown to support development and survival of NK cells as well as to stimulate their cytokine production. Liberated mainly by PAMP-activated DC, IL-15 thus also plays a crucial role in antiviral defence (Vujanovic et al., 2010).",

Concerning TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9, high expression levels were measured in the mesenteric lymph nodes and in the spleen. Interestingly, both B and T lymphocyte subsets purified from lymph nodes expressed TLRs and expression in feline CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was mainly restricted to these anti-viral associated TLRs. Infection with feline viruses in vitro also induced altered TLR expression levels in feline cells, with observed differences depending highly on cell type and TLR studied (Ignacio et al., 2005). The stimulation of feline TLRs with specific agonists has not yet been reported.",

            "text": "Studies carried out in the past 20 years have mainly focused on the characterization of feline type I IFN subtypes and their potential therapeutic effects in the context of various viral diseases. Nakamura et al. cloned the first cDNA sequence for feline IFN in 1992 (Nakamura et al., 1992). The purified protein was classified as omega-type (Ueda et al., 1993b) and rapidly shown to exhibit antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1, Table 2\n). As a result, Nakamura's IFN\u03c9 became the first feline antiviral drug available on the market, currently sold both in Japan (Intercat\u00ae, Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) and Europe (Virbagen\u00aeomega, Laboratoire Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) to treat feline calicivirus and canine parvovirus infections. Subsequently, therapeutic effects of this product as stand-alone or combinatorial agent were described in the context of a series of feline and canine diseases (Table 2). In recent years, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of many feline type I IFN subtypes have been characterized. In all, 13 subtypes each of the feIFN\u03b1 and feIFN\u03c9 genes have been cloned and the biological antiviral properties of the purified proteins were demonstrated in vitro (Table 1). Studies concerning the structure of these IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03c9 subtypes have indicated that both protein families have high homology and that feline IFN\u03c9 is more similar to the IFN\u03b1 than to the IFN\u03c9 of other animal species. Although the individual functions of all these IFN subtypes in the cat is unknown, the impressive number of type I IFN genes identified to date underlines the necessity of broad antiviral responses in felids (Table 1).",

In this way, the biological activity of Nakamura's recombinant feline IFN was initially supported by its potential to modulate OAS activity in vitro (Ueda et al., 1993a). The physiological effects of oral or ocular treatment with this recombinant IFN\u03c9 were later assessed by local and systemic measurement of the feline Mx protein (Bracklein et al., 2006), which had already been previously described (Horisberger et al., 1990). More recently, stimulation of feline cells with recombinant IFN\u03c9 was shown to induce expression of feline ISG15. Molecular cloning of this gene enabled detection of the immunomodulatory properties of both cell-conjugated and free forms of this antiviral effector protein (Tanabe et al., 2008). Altogether, these studies illustrate the breadth of IFN-induced antiviral mechanisms in the cat. The recent cloning and molecular characterization of the feline IFNAR2 (Xue et al., 2010) may support the study of further effector functions of type I IFNs in the cat.",

In a further study, inoculation of FIV-infected cats with modified L. monocytogenes carrying an expression vector for various feline cytokines indicated that IL-15 played a central role in restoring FIV-related innate immune disturbances and increasing the natural killer cell population (Dean et al., 2006).",

Primers for each system were first tested for the generation of amplicons of expected length in PCR assays comprising cDNA synthesized from ConA-stimulated PBMCs. The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Only primers indicating appropriate specificity and amplification products of correct length were utilized for further optimization. Primer and probe concentrations for each system were optimized on five-fold serial dilutions of cDNA derived from ConA-stimulated PBMCs. cDNA was diluted in 30 \u03bcg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) and quadruplicates of each dilution were tested simultaneously. Matched forward and reverse primer concentrations of 300, 600 and 900 nM were evaluated first with a probe end concentration of 250 nM. The performance of the assays was further optimized using the best primer concentrations combined with 3 different probe end concentrations, namely 50, 150, and 250 nM.

Over the course of time, mammalian hosts have developed the capacity to counterbalance virus attacks through sensing of viral signatures by specialized immune cells and immediate activation of the type I IFN system. Within minutes to hours, this family of antiviral cytokines initiates an explosion of potent defence mechanisms, leading to the suppression of viral replication and protection of the host. These intrinsic immune responses remain poorly understood in felids, a species that seems particularly sensitive to viral infections, with sporadic viral outbreaks compromising endangered populations (Evermann et al., 1988, Roelke-Parker et al., 1996, Cunningham et al., 2008, Meli et al., 2010). Until now, the appropriate tools for characterizing innate immune mechanisms in this species were unavailable. In order to better understand the early host-pathogen interactions occurring in feline viral infections, we describe herein the development of 12 real-time qPCR systems to measure the expression of feline genes related to innate antiviral defence mechanisms. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the possibility of monitoring key events in innate immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate the initiation of antiviral responses in feline immune cells upon stimulation with various IRMs.",

In these experiments, expression levels of IFN\u03b1 and IL-6 were systematically analyzed as indicators for the initiation of innate immune mechanisms. As Mx expression is strictly regulated by type I IFN (Holzinger et al., 2007), biological functionality of the induced immune responses was assessed by simultaneous analysis of this factor. In all models of infection used in this study, we observed the characteristic transient expression of type I IFN genes, with a duration ranging from 6 to 12 h in CrFK cells and FEAs inoculated with FHV and FeLV respectively to 36 h in PBMCs infected with FIV. The presence of specialized cells for the production of type I IFNs in the blood is most likely linked to the longer expression of these innate cytokines in PBMCs (Colonna et al., 2004). Moreover, IFNs \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03c9 were expressed at differential levels in feline cells upon infection; while PBMCs heavily upregulated expression of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03c9 genes, cell lines retaining epithelial and fibroblast properties preferentially increased production of IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels. Time points at which highest expression of antiviral genes was measured also greatly varied with cell type and virus. Although FEA cells responded to presence of FeLV within 6 h, induction of innate immune gene expression could only be observed after 24 h following FHV infection in CrFK cells. Peak antiviral response in PBMCs was measured 12 h after infection, with evidence for progressive development and rapid decrease of the response.

Indeed, many viruses have evolutionarily acquired sophisticated strategies to counteract the IFN system (Katze et al., 2002). Various members of the herpesvirus family have been reported to directly inhibit the proteins that mediate the antiviral state (Elia et al., 1996), interfere with the expression of signaling molecules downstream of the IFNAR (Miller et al., 1998), or hypothetically support the disassembly of nuclear structures to get rid of antiviral components (Van Sant et al., 2001). These mechanisms have been linked to persistence of infections induced by some viruses of this family. Although there is no evidence for a specific viral inhibitor of Mx proteins so far, viruses can subvert the Mx system through exceptionally fast growth in host cells (Haller et al., 2007) or by affecting signal transduction upstream of IFN-regulated gene transcription. The presence of other antiviral factors in FHV-infected feline cells could shed light on possible mechanisms linked to these findings.",

Consequently, we studied the effect of viral inoculation in PBMCs on the expression of all cytokines and receptors for which we had developed real-time qPCR systems. High levels of type I IFN expression were measured in response to infection, again most probably linked to the activation of professional dendritic cells producing extraordinary amounts of these cytokines (Colonna et al., 2004). Similar expression patterns were noted for all IFN\u03b1 gene subtypes analyzed. Lower induction rates of IFN\u03b13, 7 and 14 subtypes are most likely due to the measurement of individual genes versus the simultaneous quantification of many subtypes with the real-time assay developed for the remaining IFN\u03b1 subtypes. Although the induction of type I IFN genes largely overlap, the array of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03c9 subtypes produced upon stimulation seems to be determined by cell-specific levels of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 (Sato et al., 2000). Furthermore, the extent of biological activity conferred by each individual protein depends on a variety of factors. Thus, the differential affinity of each subtype to the subunits of the IFNAR, the surface expression level of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 in target cells, as well as the lifetime and stability of the ligand\u2013receptor complex all play a role in the extent of the host response to infection (Genin et al., 2009). Different pathogens may influence, in this way, the phenotype of the developing immune response by shaping the profile of IFN subtypes induced (Foster et al., 2004). As previously shown for the human IFN system (Loseke et al., 2003), the expression analysis of individual subtypes by real-time qPCR can provide valuable information on host innate immune responses to pathogens. We have initiated the development of appropriate tools to study these mechanisms in more detail in feline species.",

Downregulation of this cytokine was reported to be more intense when infection of the monocyte fraction itself could not be demonstrated (Kipar et al., 2004). Hypothetically, factors liberated by primarily infected lymphocytes could affect function and immune responses of monocytic cells, the main producers of IL-6 in blood.
