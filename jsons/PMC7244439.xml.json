            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging sarbecovirus, closely related to SARS-CoV-1 that emerged in China in 2004 [1]. This new strain was first described in January 2020 as a cause of a novel severe respiratory illness now known as COVID-19. As of the 3rd May 3,356,205 confirmed cases were reported globally with 238,730 deaths, affecting 215 countries around the world [2]. The rapid development of the pandemic highlights the need to speedily assemble the capability to support healthcare services in a variety of international settings. Responsive capacity building was part of the United Kingdom\u2019s strategy to rapidly scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples using qRT-PCR. A directive from the Department of Health and Social Care, and National Health Service Improvement (NHSI) instructed NHS hospitals to identify the means to increase testing capacity [3]. Accordingly, the University of Birmingham (UoB) was included in an extended laboratory network to provide additional capacity to the existing diagnostic laboratories in the West Midlands region, particularly to support healthcare worker testing. Rapid technology and knowledge transfer combined with a partnership between a UKAS-accredited clinical service and academic research infrastructure reconfigured the laboratories into a molecular diagnostic service capable of providing quality assured testing using a verified commercial test. External support was provided by Public Health England clinical virologists in an advisory role.",

Samples were processed further at CL-2 using the RNEasy Mini Kit reagents (Qiagen). qRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed using the VIASURE qRT-PCR detection test for SARS-CoV-2 (CerTest; Prolabs). The VIASURE test is a multiplex of three targets: the viral N and ORF1ab genes (China-CDC) [4], and a synthetic internal control to detect assay inhibition. Lyophilized reaction reagents were reconstituted, 15 \u00b5l of master mix used per reaction with the addition of 5 \u00b5l sample RNA. Thermocycling was performed on either ABI 7500 or QuantStudio 5 instruments. All preliminary data analysis from qRT-PCR analyses was performed using the Thermo Cloud software (Thermo Scientific), with automated threshold and baseline setting followed by careful manual inspection of individual amplification curves by two senior experienced operators. Final interpretation of the RT-PCR assay results was as specified in the manufacturer instructions for use (IFU). Confirmatory testing on indeterminate results was performed with E gene assay [4]. These results were transmitted electronically to the UKAS-accredited service, for reporting to the NHS Trust and Public Health England surveillance systems.",

The Ct values were lower (by approximately 3-5 Ct) compared to results on the subject\u2019s throat swab, suggesting a higher viral load in saliva. Interestingly, follow-up of these asymptomatic HCW whose saliva specimens were positive indicated that they later developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease. It is unclear however whether patients were truly asymptomatic at the time of sampling, or possibly overlooked mild symptoms; as they were not formally clinically assessed. Therefore, saliva may represent a specimen type that can provide a more unambiguous indicator of potential infectivity, removing the equivocality of low-level positive throat swab results.",
