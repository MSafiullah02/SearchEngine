Chinese cities have experienced a decentralization of industry from the centre (Gao et al., 2014, Hsing, 2010) and the re-use of abandoned industrial sites (Ren and Sun, 2012, Zheng, 2011). These processes of land use succession involve important elements of path dependence but are also driven by wider forces operating at multiple scales, and have gone hand in hand with changes in the character and relative importance of services and creative industries.",

General mechanisms always operate through specific events and contingent factors can often impinge on urban development trajectories (Liu & Dunford, 2012).

More than 20 senior local officials working in bureaus of land management, urban planning, Development and Reform Commission, Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Committee, and the 798 Art District Construction & Management Office and 40 art-related businesses were interviewed. In October 2013 to May 2014 further surveys and interviews were conducted with art-related businesses and in particular with new post-2011 entrants.

More recently, services have come to occupy a larger share of output and employment. Questionable observation of these trends has even led to the idea that services can provide an alternative basis for economic growth to manufacturing (Gershuny, 1977). The service sector includes dynamic and non-dynamic sectors and tax and market-financed services. These activities include the cultural industries (originally identified by Frankfurt School theoreticians Adorno and Horkheimer to denote the mass production of standardized cultural goods). The cultural industries are frequently construed as creative industries in which human creativity is harnessed to promote innovation (Caves, 2004; Landry, 2000). These industries are concentrated in large cities where major cultural industry players are located and where government-funded galleries, museums, libraries and universities are strongly represented and talented people are attracted.",

Two year later, cultural industries were officially recognized as an economic sector for the first time in one of the \u2018recommendations\u2019 of the 10th National Five-Year Planning (Keane, 2009a, Keane, 2009b). Since then, some state-subsidized public cultural service units or public institutions have been gradually transformed into state-owned cultural enterprises, policy environments have gradually become creative industry-friendly, and the aim of making China an innovative country by 2020 contributed to the construction of innovation-related policy systems that embraced creative industries.",

His bookstore and publishing office drew on contacts with global publishing to grow into an important global publisher of illustrated Chinese art books. Tokyo Gallery was the first foreign-owned gallery in the district. Founded in the 1950s in Tokyo as a professional art gallery promoting contemporary Asian art on the international stage by Yukihito Tabata, a globally known avant-garde artist, It began exhibiting other Asian countries' avant-garde works, starting with Korean artists in 1970s, and Chinese artists in 1990s. Believing that China would become the centre of the Asian art market, Yukihito Tabata opened the Beijing Tokyo Art Projects (BTAP) in 2002.",

The motives were to re-kindle collective memory of the factory area, to call for the conservation of the complex the SevenStar Group wanted to demolish and to re-define the previous industrial area as an art district. However, the SevenStar Group strongly argued that the artists had no right to redevelop the industrial area, as they were merely \u2018temporary\u2019 tenants according to China's urban land regulation. Hence, in 2004, the SevenStar Group announced that artists could no longer rent new places in the industrial area.

Moreover, after several rounds of sub-letting the rent of some workshops reached 4\u20135 Yuan/m2/day (Chi, 2014). In 2013, the average rent surpassed 6 Yuan/m2/day (Interview with a gallery owner, November 2013). Many art studios and galleries, especially smaller ones, were forced to withdraw. As a gallery owner who moved into the area before 2005 said:The rent has risen too fast in the recent past, many art institutions and shops have left for other creative parks, and many shops have frequently changed their owner. I know the rent of some places is now 8 Yuan/m2/day. It is too expensive for us. If I did not rent this workshop as early as 2004, and if my rent contact was not as long as ten years, it would also difficult for me to remain in Factory 798. But my contract is running out.

These foreign-owned galleries often occupied less than 800 m2. The largest one (Art Seasons Gallery from Singapore) occupied 764 m2. Two years later, the situation had changed. In 2008 the number of galleries reached 153, while the studios stood at 43 (Table 3). In contrast to early galleries, some of the new ones rented large amounts of floor space. The Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA), which is self-proclaimed not-for-profit art institution founded by the Belgian collectors, Guy and Myriam Ullens, was opened in 2007, and rented 5000 m2 of floor space. UCCA gained considerable global repute since hundreds of art museum curators, collectors, and artists from around the world were invited to attend its opening ceremony. After the arrival of UCCA, other high profile galleries moved in, including, for example, in 2007 Gallery Artside (Korean), and in 2008 Pace Gallery (American), White Space Beijing (Italy), and Artlinkart (Spain). Artlinkart occupied 4000 m2 and Pace Gallery 3000 m2. Moreover, the large galleries became mixed businesses.
