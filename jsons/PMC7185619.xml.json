            "text": "Immune system is an intricate meshwork of the cells and tissues that act together to defend an individual from extraneous invaders such as microorganism. The crucial thing about the immune system is its proper modulation. Any kind of alteration in the immune system either by activating or inhibiting its function is termed as immunomodulation. Those substances which have the potential to interact with immune system and are involved in the modulation of immune response i.e. stimulation or suppression are coined as immunomodulators [1], [2]. There are vast varieties of immunomodulators which includes natural compounds, some bacterial products, lymphokines and synthetic drugs. There are three targeting areas for a potent immunomodulator i.e. stimulation, suppression and restoration of the immune system. Unlike vaccine, most of the immunomodulatory agents are not real antigens but antigenomimetics or so called mitogens. Production of memory cells is not observed by immunomodulator because of its non-specific and non-antigenic properties. Due to this reason, the effect of immunomodulator agents is reduced after a short period of time [3].",

            "text": "Thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) is a phenolic compound found in many medicinal plants derived essential oils. A plant Thymus ciliates is found to have immense amount of thymol [7]. Most of the food and cosmetic industries use thymol as a preservative and antioxidant compound. Its protective nature against caries and plaques attracts the field of dental medicine. Thymol is a potent compound used to elicit the release of calcium from skeletal and smooth muscles to activate ryanodine receptors and suppress the transient outward K+ and the L-type Ca2 + current in mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes. Release of the stored intracellular calcium in neural cells and potentiation of GABAA receptor properties of thymol has been reported. Recent studies reported on thymol demonstrate its activity as a \u03b11-adrenergic agonist in circular smooth muscle cells isolated from guinea pig stomach, which activates the transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 of the tongue and nasal epithelium and also inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro. Its strong property of neutralizing COX1 activity or elastase released by neutrophils suggests its anti-inflammatory potential too [8].",

This phagosomal and plasma membrane-associated enzyme complex is normally in dormant state but rapidly get in action when cells are in contact with antigen or inflammatory stimuli [19], [20] to generate superoxide which is a precursor to numerous microbicidal oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed formation of hypochlorous acid [21]. An alteration of superoxide generation or absence of these enzymes leads to formation of inflammatory granulomas which is a distinctive feature of chronic granulomatous diseases [21]. We determined this activity with the help of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) chemiluminescence assay. As some of reactive oxygen intermediates have a very short time existence at high energy state, but the release of this energy is in the form of chemiluminescence which can be easily determine spectrophotometrically [22]. The results obtained from NBT test evidenced that even at a low concentration; thymol can potentiates this mechanism of macrophages which further we observed was increased in a concentration dependent manner. We hypothesized, that thymol is probably involved in the small GTP-binding protein i.e. Rac, which act as molecular switches through conformational changes between the GDP and GTP-bound forms. Rac-GTP binds to the membrane and to p67phox, and is required for NADPH oxidase activity [21].",

They can impair the potency of macrophages which ultimately cause inflammatory disorders and among these factors cytokines are critical one. The network of cytokines and their signaling pathways have been well recognized in regulation of both innate and acquired immune responses [23]. One of the important cytokine which is involved in inflammation is tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). TNF-\u03b1 can induce fever, either directly via stimulation of PGE2 synthesis by the vascular endothelium of the hypothalamus, or indirectly by inducing release of IL-1 [23]. We determined that thymol possess a potency to alter the level of TNF-\u03b1 in a dose dependent pattern. A significantly decreased level of TNF-\u03b1 by thymol was observed at a concentration dependent manner when compared with LPS treated cells which indicates its anti-inflammatory property. Another important cytokines which is either stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 or directly activated and involved in inflammatory responses is IL-1\u00df a potent pro inflammatory cytokine which is engaged in various type of cellular function including proliferation, activation and differentiation [24]. Through induction of IL-8 and activation of neutrophils IL-1\u00df induces the chemotaxis of leukocytes [25]. Thus in the present study we determined the effect of thymol on release of IL-1\u00df, and found a decrease in its level as the concentration was increased of thymol, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction pathway essential for the production of IL-1\u00df.",

Synthesis of PGE2 is dependent on two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms, COX-1 or COX-2, through conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2\n[26], [27]. Expression of COX-1 is observed in most of the tissues to maintain homeostasis by producing PGE2\n[28]. An up-regulation of COX-2 is seen in the case of inflammatory condition, so it is believed to have a role on production of PGE2\n[29]. This was the reason why we concentrated to identify the possible role of thymol against PGE2. As we were expecting, we found a decrease in the production of PGE2 by thymol in accordance with concentration. The reduction in the PGE2 level by thymol is supposed to be due to its inhibitory effect on COX-2 [30].",

On the other hand, there are numerous data demonstrating that its undesired activation induces inflammation and finally tissue damage. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) an infectious disease which is responsible for many deaths is reported to be because of excessive activation of complement system [31]. We decided to evaluate anti complementary activity (classical pathway) of thymol which works on a principle of hemolysis of erythrocytes after binding with free complement. There was no significant difference between two initial concentrations but a significant percentage of complement inhibition was observed at highest concentration used. Data obtained from this experiment demonstrated the involvement of thymol in classical complement pathway which potentially inhibits its activation.",

Inhibitory effect of thymol against various inflammatory cytokines proposes its potential use as an anti-inflammatory drug, especially in the case of lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation. Availability of thymol in natural spices used in routine diet supports that it is safe to use thymol by both immunocompromised patients and healthy individuals as well, for proper regulation of immune response. Further researches, on involvement of thymol in other immunological cells and immunity can insight its other beneficial aspects in biological system.",
