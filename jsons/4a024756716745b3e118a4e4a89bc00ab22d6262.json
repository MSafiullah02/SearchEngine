Lymphopenia, not neutropenia, can be seen in 70%. 7 Given the possible overlap in symptomatology, it is important to counsel patients taking thionamide therapy who develop fevers and/or pharyngitis during the COVID-19 pandemic. While agranulocytosis is a rare side effect, our opinion is that these patients should still have a CBC performed to exclude a rare but potentially life-threatening diagnosis. However, sending the patient to an outpatient laboratory in the setting of such symptoms may unknowing place health care workers at risk should the patient ultimately prove to have COVID-19. Therefore, these patients will need to be evaluated in an urgent care or emergency room setting, where the clinical concern for agranulocytosis should be discussed with the triage team prior to arrival, and the patient can be further evaluated with a CBC as well as COVID-19 testing as clinically indicated.",
