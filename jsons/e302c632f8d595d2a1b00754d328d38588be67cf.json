Respirology 2005; 10 : 107-110 Objectives: Before the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), use of the powered airpurifying respirator (PAPR) in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis has been controversial. Data regarding health care worker (HCW) perceptions and problems encountered with the use of the PAPRs were lacking. Methodology: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted of HCWs who had used the PAPR in clinical practice during the SARS outbreak, when use of the PAPR was mandatory and widespread. Evaluations of the question of whether HCWs were receptive to the use of the PAPR and their perceptions of common problems that were encountered were made. Perceptions of comfort, ease of use, visual, hearing, breathing and speech impairment, perceived protection against SARS and usage preferences were recorded. Results: Only a minority of respondents found the PAPR uncomfortable, despite some interference with communication. Despite its much higher cost, the majority (84%) preferred to use the PAPR rather than the N-95 respirator when treating suspected SARS patients. However, opinions were equally divided regarding its use when treating patients with pulmonary tuberculosis; with 51% being in favour. Conclusions: With the advent of highly contagious diseases that pose a major occupational hazard to HCWs, the use of the PAPR has become more acceptable in clinical practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Strict infection control measures were instituted in Singapore with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003. All heath care workers (HCWs) caring for patients suspected of having SARS were required to wear gloves, gowns, goggles and N-95 respirators, while powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) were mandatory for high-risk or aerosol-generating procedures. 1 'N' class signifies protection against non-oil-based aerosols and '95' means that the respirator is at least 95% efficient at filtering particles with a median diameter greater than 0.3 m m. 2 In contrast to the disposable N-95 respirator, the PAPR has a motor that draws air through a filter, delivering filtered air under positive pressure to a hood. 3 It is also more costly, with the 3M PAPR (3M, USA) costing about US$860 as compared to the disposable N-95 that costs only $0.70 at the National University Hospital, Singapore.

Our findings are consistent with the initial concerns of US doctors in 1992, 5 that the PAPR makes the wearer look frightening and interferes with communication.
