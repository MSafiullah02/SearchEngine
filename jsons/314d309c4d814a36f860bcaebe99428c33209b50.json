These values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean ( f sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 f 10.2 pg/ml present at 30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 f 0.8 pg/ml. From the pharmacological analysis of concentration-time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the i m injection site, with an absorption half-time of 0.16 f 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7 f 26.9 per cent). A peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug. At 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. Based on the MIC values of the majority of isolates of Corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 pg neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/ kg) to be therapeutically effective.",

On most occasions it is used in combination with penicillin to give a broad spectrum of action when empirical therapy is instituted. As can be seen from Table 1 , however, few of the common equine pathogens remain susceptible to this antibiotic. No species is predictably sensitive to streptomycin and sensitivity testing of isolates is mandatory before this antibiotic should be considered for therapy. Kanamycin has been used infrequently in veterinary medicine and veterinary preparations of kanamycin are not readily available.

Care is also required in oral administration of neomycin to individuals with renal insufficiency. In these cases, enough neomycin is absorbed to enable toxic concentrations to accumulate in the circulation (Weinstein 1975b) .

As shown in this paper and also illustrated by Barton and Hughes (1980) most strains of C equi are sensitive to neomycin. The usefulness of neomycin for treatment of Cequi infections should be considered by clinicians treating this condition. It is a much less expensive drug than gentamicin which is used widely in North America for treatment of this condition; it is not a drug extensively used in man.

Pathol. 20, 653-661.THIS paper describes the clinical and pathological features of primary duodenitis in foals in its acute, necrotising, perforating form as well as its chronic form with duodenal adhesions and structures.Seven foals, aged 18 days to three-and-a-half months, had acute necrotising and perforating duodenitis with diffuse fibrinous peritonitis. The foals came from four different farms and showed signs of illness for 0 to three days before death (five cases) or euthanasia (two cases). Clinical signs included diarrhoea, depression, distended abdomen, shock, abdominal pain, teeth grinding and sudden death. Treatment included antibiotics (three cases) and flunixin meglumine (five cases).A further two foals showed signs of illness for 14 and 16 days respectively. These signs included diarrhoea, gastric reflux, teeth grinding, weight loss and dehydration. Both foals were destroyed after a period of treatment. In all foals, samples of intestine, lung and spleen were taken for histology, bacteriology, immunofluorescence for equine herpesvirus, and negative contrast electron microscopy for viruses, eg, adenovirus and coronavirus.At post mortem examination, the acute cases showed necrotic grey-green friable areas in the proximal duodenum which consisted of single or multiple annular segments or long antimesenteric bands extending through the thickness of the duodenum and clearly delineated on the serosal surface.Within these areas were round or linear antimesenteric perforations. The necrotic areas were thin (1 mm) whereas the tissue between these bands was thicker than normal.The two chronic cases showed thickening of the duodenal wall where large areas of mucosa and submucosa were replaced by granulation tissue. In one case there were also several adhesions. In the areas of the duodenum where mucosa was present there was either moderate or severe villous atrophy with cellular infiltration or fibrosis of the lamina propria. Additional histological lesions included necrosis of lymphoid tissue of the Peyer's patches, large intestinal lymphoid nodules, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in all foals examined (six). One foal with serosal adhesions near the bile ducts also had diffuse acute cholangitis, subacute pancreatitis and acute erosive fibrinous inflammation of the large ducts.Escherichi cofi was isolated from intestinal contents (two cases), peritoneal fluid (one case) and various other tissues (one case). Enterobacter species and Proteus species were cultured from one foal and rotavirus from another. No equine herpesvirus, adenovirus or coronavirus was found in four cases examined.The authors believe these to be two forms of the one syndrome and the primary lesions to be the duodenal ones because gastric ulceration is seen fairly frequency at post mortem examination of foals. The cause of the duodenitis is not known but comparisons have been made with lesions seen at Clostridium perfringens type B enterotoxaemia in lambs. Stress and treatment with phenylbutazone and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be contributory factors by creating conditions for infection to become established.",
