Diagnosis and prediction of disease progression in RA are of great importance, since early treatment may ameliorate the later development of severe erosions and joint immobilization. Several factors have been suggested to predict a more aggressive disease course. One such factor is the DR4 locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (2, 3) ; others are rheumatoid factors, which are elevated before the onset of arthritis (4), antibodies to citrulline-composed epitopes (5) , and various acutephase proteins (6, 7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 369, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 715, "end": 718, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 719, "end": 721, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 852, "end": 855, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 890, "end": 893, "text": "(6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 894, "end": 896, "text": "7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Acute-phase proteins such as \u2423 1 -acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), fibrinogen, and \u2423 1 -inhibitor 3 are characterized by altered plasma levels as an outcome of inflammation (8, 9) .
