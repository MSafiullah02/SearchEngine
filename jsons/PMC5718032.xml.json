Studies on the epidemiological role of chiropterans in the transmission of pathogens have focused mainly on zoonotic viruses such as rabies [2, 3], acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4], Ebola [5], Zika [6], and other viral disease (influenza, acute respiratory illness, chikungunya) [7]. Compared with other mammals, the role of bats in the transmission cycle of tick-borne protists [8, 9] and bacteria are less studied [10, 11]. The life-cycle of most of the Babesia spp. in domestic animals is well known and involves a hard tick as a definitive host [12]. However, for bat piroplasms, the life-cycle (including a complete range of the vertebrate hosts) and the vectors involved are unknown.",

The species was later reported in the UK [15] in blood smears of bats, followed by experimental transmission studies [16]. Concannon et al. [17] identified the infection with B. vesperuginis by PCR targeting the 18S rDNA in six individuals from a total of 60 bats from Cornwall, UK, and they concluded that the parasite is different from other known Babesia. The only study outside Europe reports the presence of unidentified Babesia in Mormoops megalophylla from Colombia, with a low microscopic prevalence of 1.19% in blood smears [18]. In general, the diversity and ecology of bat piroplasmids remains unknown, and there is no data regarding how the parasite is transmitted. Hornok et al. [8] studied the presence of apicomplexan protozoans in bat faeces from Hungary and Romania. All samples were tested for the presence of piroplasms DNA with a conventional PCR and the positive samples (2.25%) have shown similarity with Babesia canis.",

All animals were found either as accidental kills of wind power generators, dead due to natural causes or euthanized because of progressive deterioration of general condition (in few captive specimens). A wind farm in Babadag, Romania, consisting of 20 turbines was monitored for a period of four years (2013\u20132016) using a weekly time frame with two consecutive days of carcass searches, from April to November. Bat carcases were found either fresh or desiccated. Samples were collected from carcasses which have been labelled fresh. These have been found on the second day of each weekly field visit and presented no signs of maggots or decomposition. All bats were identified according to morphological keys [19] and stored in 96% ethanol, at -80 \u00b0C (samples from Austria) or in a freezer until their necropsy. Morphological identification of whiskered bats from the Myotis mystacinus group (M. alcathoe, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus) is not only problematic, but these species may show signs of hybridization [20]. Therefore, we distinguished these as the \u2018most likely\u2019 morphological species (e.g. Myotis cf. alcathoe in case of a bat identified morphologically as M. alcathoe). Genomic DNA was extracted from 25 mg of heart tissue using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction and stored at -20 \u00b0C.\n",

In hibernating sites, even species which roost in trees may encounter a wide variety of ectoparasites, including soft ticks. Some species are sedentary (M. alcathoe, M. bechsteinii, Pi. pipistrellus) [19], others are adapted to migration over a few hundred kilometres (M. myotis) [19] and others migrate for long-distance, up to 2000 km (N. noctula, Pi. nathusii, V. murinus) [19, 34]. Long distance migrants feed on the go, fuelling their energy loss while migrating [34]. The range of species studied and their diverse ecology showed that B. vesperuginis has a wide geographical distribution among different bat populations; it can be spread over a long distance and has low bat host specificity. Most of the bat species that were negative for the presence of B. vesperuginis are sedentary, except Mi. schreibersii and N. leisleri. However, in most of the cases, the negativity of certain bat species for B. vesperuginis might have been a consequence of the small sample size.",

[15] suggested the involvement of Argas vespertilionis as a vector, as this soft tick was found on the majority of the Pi. pipistrellus bats infected with B. vesperuginis. Similarly, only soft ticks (Ornithodoros marinkellei and Antricola mexicanus) were found on Mormoops megalophylla bats infected with Babesia sp. in Colombia [19]. However, the presence of B. vesperuginis has never been tested in soft ticks of bats. Moreover, for nearly all the Babesia species with a known life-cycle, the vector is a hard tick [35], suggesting a close co-evolution of piroplasms with the family Ixodidae. Nevertheless, Babesia meri is transmitted by Ornithodoros erraticus to the fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus) [36]. In addition, circumstantial evidence indicates the possible role of O. moubata (Argasidae) in the transmission of B. gibsoni in dogs after being artificially infected with this parasite [37], showing that the involvement of a soft tick in the life-cycle of Babesia sp. is possible. All hard ticks identified (a few individuals) on the individual bats included in the present study were examined and proved negative for the presence of B. vesperuginis in a different study [9].",
