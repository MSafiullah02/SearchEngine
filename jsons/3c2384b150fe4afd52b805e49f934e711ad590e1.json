            "text": "symptomatic patients with epidemiologic links. However, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, nosocomial transmission persisted despite active quarantine measures. 2 Early data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to be transmitted than MERS-CoV infection because of a higher estimated reproductive number (2.2 vs. 0.9) and a shorter estimated serial interval distribution (7.5 days vs. 12.6 days). 3, 4 Among the 28 infected patients reported here, Covid-19 was diagnosed by surveillance testing in South Korea in 3 who were asymptomatic. Although asymptomatic transmission has been suggested, it is uncertain when patients with Covid-19 are infectious during the incubation period or whether they are infectious primarily when they have symptoms. 5 This letter was published on April 6, 2020, at NEJM.org.
