The actual procedure for producing a metal shadow is relatively simple; a heavy metal is evaporated from a source at an oblique angle to the specimen. The metal atoms pile up on the surfaces that face the source, but the surfaces away from the source are shielded and receive little metal deposit, creating a \"shadow.\" However, the process of producing biological specimens that are suitable for metal shadowing can be very complex. There are a whole host of specimen preparation techniques that can precede metal shadowing, and all provide superior preservation in comparison to air drying, a required step in negative staining procedures. The physical forces present during air drying (i.e., surface tension of the water-air interface) will literally crush most biological specimens as they dry. In this chapter I explain the development of and procedures for the production of biological specimens from macromolecular assemblies (e.g., DNA and RNA), purified isolated molecules (e.g., proteins), and isolated viruses and bacteria preparations suitable for metal shadowing. A variation on this basic technique is to rotate the specimen during the metal deposition to produce a high-resolution three-dimensional rendering of the specimen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The uses of transmission electron microscopy as applied in materials science progressed fairly rapidly.

Then in 1946 a young researcher, Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, at Ann Arbor Michigan found an unused electron microscope in the basement of the Bacteriology Laboratory and succeeded in taking beautiful pictures of the influenza virus. They were particularly appealing because of the metal shadowing technique that he had just developed, which provided threedimensional images of the virus. With further improvements on this technique; modern and substantially better apparatus for preparing our specimens, metal shadowing has become a rapid and reliable method to produce very-high-resolution images of many types of biological specimens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History"}, {"text": "The shadow casting consists of evaporating a metal source at an oblique angle to the specimen. The smaller the objects being shadowed the smaller the angle must be. The effect of the oblique deposition is to deposit metal onto the relatively higher portions of the specimen, thus casting a partial or total shadow in the direction opposite the source. When the metal shadowed specimens are observed in the electron microscope, areas where the metal coating is the thickest will scatter the electron beam creating dark areas while those areas where the metal is thin will be transparent to the beam and appear bright. The images were originally view as photograph negative images where the metalized areas appeared white and the shadows (very thin areas) appeared dark [3] . It was thought that these images conformed more closely to the usual usage of the term shadow. This changed with the invention of Rotary shadowing techniques. Heinmets introduced a variant on the original technique by placing a small electric motor into the vacuum chamber and spinning the specimen during shadowing to coat surface structures with a uniform film of metal on all sides [4] . This still produced a three dimensional image but now it appeared much more vivid if it was viewed as a positive image and so like all transmission electron micrographs, these images are now viewed as positive images rather than as the photographic negative (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1162, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1423, "end": 1431, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "History"}, {"text": "While uniform deposition of metal on all sides of a particle provides greater contrast, it also can produce curious artifacts. Neugebauer and Zingsheim observed these artifacts and studied the relationship of these artifacts to the angle of shadowing, and found that it was most pronounced at low shadowing angles [5] . Particles that have a great degree of structural symmetry often appeared to have a donut-shape hole at their centers when viewed from above. A similar problem occurs when looking at filamentous structures when you are examining the \"handedness\" (i.e., right or left helical twist) as exhibited by strands of protein, DNA, or RNA. The direction of the twist can be completely obscured by the metal coating. With symmetrical particles, the problem can be even more challenging if the particles are expected to have an actual hole in their center, such as connexons of gap junctions, then this artifact becomes very apparent. In 1982, Hirokawa and Heuser confirmed that connexons of gap junctions do indeed have a central tunnel after examining the structure by employing both unidirectional and rotary-shadowing techniques at relatively high angle [6] . This study clearly demonstrated that an understanding of the structure in question is prerequisite to the correct interpretation of the images provided by the electron microscope.

Although some metals are more prone to creep and puddling (e.g., pure gold) than others, in most cases the use of alloys (i.e., gold-palladium or platinum-palladium) and working at very high vacuum (10 \u22127 Torr) will prevent thermal creep of the deposited metal film. Modern shadowing techniques utilize a variety of metals and alloys including platinum, gold, palladium, tungsten, tantalum, and europium; see the table list of metals below. Of these metals, the most popularly used for shadowing biological specimens are platinum coevaporated with carbon or alloyed with palladium, introduced in 1959 by Bradley, and tantalum evaporated on a tungsten filament, introduced in 1962 by Bachmann and Hayek [9, 10] . These two alloys have been found to produce very fine-grain films owing to the fact that recrystallization of the film after evaporation and deposition is minimal. In the case of platinum-carbon coevaporation technique, the carbon appears to reduce the tendency of the platinum to recrystallization by improving the thermal conductivity of the biological matrix. However, tantalum belongs to the group of refractory metals; loosely defined in metallurgy and material science as a subgroup of elements (e.g., Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Re) with melting points above 2,000 \u00b0C, high hardness at room temperature, chemically inert, and relatively high densities. Their extremely high melting points and stability against creep deformation and their inability to recrystallize make these metals a good choice for high-resolution metal shadowing (see Note 1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 845, "end": 857, "text": "Bachmann and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Requirements for Metal Shadowing"}, {"text": "There are a whole host of specimen preparation techniques that can precede metal shadowing, and all provide superior preservation in comparison to air drying, a required step in negative staining procedures.

Tyler and Branton reported a significant improvement on this technique by first mixing the macromolecules into a solution of glycerol (40-50 %) and ammonium acetate buffer before air spraying the sample onto freshly cleaved mica sheets [12] . This modification produced a more dispersed spreading and even distribution of the macromolecules on the mica surface. They called this new modification \"Glycerol drying\". Specifically, they added glycerol to the sample before spraying it onto the mica and backed the metal replica with a carbon film. The addition of glycerol was first proposed as a cryoprotectant/antifreeze because in their first attempts the macromolecules were sprayed onto mica sheets that were placed onto liquid nitrogen cooled copper blocks. Glycerol spraying/low-angle rotary shadowing has been shown to preserve native conformations comparably to cryo-techniques [13] . However, the glycerol spraying technique works equally well at room temperature because glycerol is actually acting as a wetting agent to preserve the water activity at the molecular level around the molecules until they are dried in the vacuum apparatus. Vacuum drying of sprayed macromolecules even in a glycerol solution does not completely avoid drying artifacts. Molecules sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces and visualized by this method are noticeably flattened and extended. However, the results obtained by this method are still far superior to those obtained by air drying alone. Fowler and Aebi [14] suggested that this artifact was due to the impact force with which the macromolecule-containing drops of glycerol hit the mica surface during spraying. The impact velocity is such that the droplets are flattened, then immediately retract, leaving a ring of macromolecules adsorbed to the mica in a thin layer of buffer solution around the central droplet. Once placed in the vacuum the very thin layer of volatile buffer dries \"instantaneously,\" leaving what has been", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 509, "end": 513, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1161, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1781, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Requirements for Metal Shadowing"}, {"text": "described as the \"halo\" around the dried center droplets of glycerol and salt residues from the buffers [14] .

This suggests that the flattening effect is do, at least in part to the highly charged surface of the freshly cleaved mica substrate and not the \"instantaneous\" drying proposed by Fowler and Aebi [14] .

Using this method of spreading DNA, Klenschmidt demonstrated that the shape and molecular weight of DNA can be obtained by viewing these macromolecules spontaneously adsorbed onto prepared support films from solutions which contained formaldehyde and a critical amount of cytochrome C. The subsequent transfer of the macromolecules to support grids, metal shadowing, and imaging in the electron microscope revealed individual molecules suitable for quantitative evaluation. The mica sandwich technique was introduced by A. Paul Mould et al. as an alternative to glycerol spraying to reduce the shearing forces on the macromolecules during the spray application [17] . Their sandwich method suggested that by replacing glycerol spraying by simply placing a few drops of your sample suspension in 40-70 % glycerol between two sheets of freshly cleaved mica, provided a better way of adsorbing macromolecular assemblies, intact onto the mica substrate. The technique is very simple and effective for larger and more shear sensitive material than conventional spraying. Placing a few drops of your suspension of macromolecules onto the freshly cleaved mica surface and then re-opposing the other sheet on top causes the suspension to be applied evenly to both surfaces by capillary action. The macromolecules are absorbed onto the mica surfaces, and the two pieces are then separated and dried in the vacuum apparatus at 10 \u22126 Torr with the glycerol layer uppermost and rotary shadowed.

To ensure a smooth, even spread of sample and stain, the support film must be hydrophilic. A freshly carbon-coated grid will provide good spreading, but older grids may not. Methods for returning hydrophobic grids to a state where they will provide an acceptable, even spreading of your sample have been described [4] . The best way is to glow discharge them if a vacuum evaporator or a glow discharge device if one is available. If you do not have access to a glow discharge devise, an easy and surprisingly effective method is to treat the grids on a drop of 1 % aqueous Alcian blue for 5 min and then wash them on three to five drops of water until the rinse droplets are clear. These procedures should be done just prior to adsorbing the sample suspension. There is some question about how long the grids remain fresh; some publications suggest 30 min others insist that the carbonized films must be \"aged\" in a refrigerator for at least a week prior to use. I have always found that freshly prepared carbonized Formvar support films work best if made fresh the day you need them. However, if they are stored in a petri dish sealed with Parafilm, they can remain hydrophilic for several days. 5 .
