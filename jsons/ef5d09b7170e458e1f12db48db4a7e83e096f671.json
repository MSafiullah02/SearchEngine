In transplant patients with mild to moderate infections, the usual practice is to continue or make reductions in the dose of immunosuppressive drugs, but this approach might favor high mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. While we acknowledge that firm recommendations are not possible based on the small sample size of this study, we suggest that antiproliferative agents (MMF and azathioprine) should be stopped at the time of admission to hospital, dose of prednisolone should be either unchanged or increased, and tacrolimus dose should be reduced. In severe infections (requiring intubation and ventilation), an argument can be made for stopping calcineurin inhibitors completely while maintaining corticosteroid therapy. The role of cytokine storm and inflammation due to antiviral immune response as a driver of severe respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome has been discussed since the outbreak of this disease in December 2019, prompting trials of anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and case for continuing steroids in infected patients. A similar argument can be made for continuing low-dose tacrolimus, but more evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions. An obvious concern is risk of rejection with reduction in immunosuppression but given the high mortality rate of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients, clinicians should focus on keeping their patients alive with a careful case-by-case assessment of risks versus benefits of continuing immunosuppression. With regard to induction treatment, it is likely that lymphocyte-depleting antibodies increase the risk; therefore, many centers in the United Kingdom have stopped performing transplants requiring induction with either Q20 antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. All patients in this series received basiliximab induction therapy at time of transplantations. Five of the 7 patients presented here were receiving triple immunosuppression. Two patients with mild illness who did not require hospital admission and recovered fully at home were on dual immunosuppression (1 on azathioprine plus prednisolone and 1 on tacrolimus plus MMF).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "With regard to concomitant therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers, in line with current UK Renal Association and European Society of Cardiology recommendations, these therapies were not discontinued.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "One of our 7 patients died, which is a mortality rate of 14%, although it is too soon to comment on likely mortality rates in this group of patients. Two of our patients presented within 3 months after transplantation and 1 presented within 2 weeks. UK National Health Service Blood and Transplant Organ Donation and Transplantation have since produced guidelines on COVID-19 screening in deceased donors and the transplant units are risk stratifying donors and recipients before considering kidney transplantation. Transplantation is a high-risk procedure during this pandemic due to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 infection from the donor to the recipient as well as risk of recipient developing severe disease under higher levels of immunosuppression in the first 3 months posttransplant. We suggest that apart from carefully selecting donor-recipient pairs, transplantation is not advisable during this pandemic, especially for older recipients with comorbidities, in particular diabetes. We have stopped performing living donor transplants and are in discussions to suspend deceased donor program. In addition to significant concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on immunosuppressed patients, increasing worries about access to ITU in the coming weeks and redistribution of staff to critical care to provide support for increasing number of COVID-19 patients, it is likely that deceased donor program will be suspended within most of the UK centers soon.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "AKI has been described with COVID-19 infections in up to 15% patients, and occurrence of proteinuria or hematuria has been reported.
