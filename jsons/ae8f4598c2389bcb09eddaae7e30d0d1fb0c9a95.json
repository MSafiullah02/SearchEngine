The ratio of the ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm can be utilized to distinguish between monomeric and oligomeric states of helices [33] ; when the ratio u222/u208 equals about 0.8, the peptide is in its monomeric state, and when the ratio exceeds the value of 1.0 is in its oligomeric state. The data reveal that in presence of 20% TFE gH626-644 adopts an a-helical conformation with the monomer/oligomer equilibrium shifted toward the oligomeric state with a ratio u222/u208 of approximately 1.05, while at higher percentages of TFE the ratio decreases to 0.76 indicating a monomeric state. Lau et al. [29] have previously shown that TFE 50% disrupts the quaternary structure of a-helices, i.e. TFE is a denaturant of tertiary and quaternary structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. We thus assayed the secondary structure dependence from the concentration in a solution containing 20% TFE, a condition in which gH626-644 showed the presence of oligomeric species (Fig. 4A) . In 20% TFE, the peptide gH626-644 revealed a characteristic a-helix spectrum, with an ellipticity strongly dependent on concentration, suggesting the formation of aggregates (Fig. 5A ). We concluded, however, that the aggregates were molecular in size because centrifugation, which removes precipitated hydrophobic peptides from solution, had no effect on the spectra. Furthermore, a strong concentration dependence of the helicity would not be expected for macroscopic aggregates. From the ellipticity at 222 nm, we estimated helicities of about 19% at 5 mM and of about 36% for 50 mM, at higher concentra- tion it starts to diminish and at 200 mM is approximately 31%. The data reveal values of u222/u208 always around 1 indicating that the peptide is always in its oligomeric state. The same analysis were performed on gH493-512. The titration of gH493-512 as a function of TFE (Fig. 4B) , showed that in 20% TFE, the peptide adopts an a-helical conformation, with a percentage of helix of 19%; the ratio of the ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm reveals that at this percentage of TFE, the peptide is in its oligomeric state with a ratio u222/u208 of approximately 1.00, while at higher percentages of TFE the ratio is approximately 0.80 indicating a monomeric state. In 20% TFE (Fig. 5B) , also the peptide gH493-512 revealed a characteristic a-helix spectrum, with an ellipticity strongly dependent on concentration, suggesting the formation of aggregates.

From the ellipticity at 222 nm, we estimated helicities of about 18% at 5 mM and of about 35% for 100 mM, at 200 mM decreases to approximately 25%. A similar behaviour with a sudden fall in molecular ellipticity was previously observed for aggregating peptides [5] . Moreover, the two peptides show a similar tendency to associate and produce molecular aggregates of helices but the critical concentration differs for the two peptides, in particular the maximum ellipticity was observed at 50 mM for gH626-644 and at 100 mM for gH493-512, indicating a greater tendency of gH626-644 to aggregate (Fig. 5 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 285, "end": 289, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2986, "end": 2989, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 57, "text": "(Fig. 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1137, "text": "(Fig. 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1322, "text": "(Fig. 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2030, "text": "(Fig. 4B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2429, "text": "(Fig. 5B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 3320, "end": 3327, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Secondary structure of synthetic peptides"}, {"text": "The oligomeric state of the peptides with NATIVE-PAGE electrophoresis", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3.5."}, {"text": "The tendency of the peptides gH626-644 and gH493-512 to oligomerize was further explored in NATIVE-PAGE (Fig. 6 ) using isolated peptides and peptides with 4 mM and 5 mM SDS.

Its ability to induce membrane fusion parallel recent results reported on HIV gp41 loop domain [39] . The peptide gH493-537 and principally its shorter analog gH493-512 are also able to inhibit the entry of HSV-1. Interestingly, it was recently reported [17] that deletion of the C-terminus of gH493-537, from a 513 to aa 531, and its replacement with heterologous fusion peptides in a sense or antisense direction, decreases infection to less than 10% relative to wt-gH and almost abolished cell-cell fusion.
