The pressure of caring for patients is amplified in the setting of a virus with human-human transmission and no specific lifesaving treatment [2]. Handling life and death situations while simultaneously putting one's own life at risk contributes to an actual sense of danger. Other physician and nurse workplace stressors during COVID-19 include extended shifts with increased volume and severity of patients [3,4]. Triaging patients while knowing that there are a limited number of ventilators and ICU beds cause emotional and psychological strain [3,5]. Physicians must make critical decisions for their patients in the absence of familial bedside input since visitors are no longer allowed in hospitals. The emotional trauma endured by physicians is intensifying as they witness high volumes of death, including infection and deterioration of coworkers [2].",

Currently, the stress extends outside of the realm of healthcare facilities. Physicians worrying about infecting their families and contaminating their homes may choose to self-isolate or face the guilt of potentially infecting a family member [6]. Social isolation and subjective feelings of solitude are known risk factors for suicide, and it is already established that physicians have higher rates of suicide than the general population [1,6]. A recent study in Wuhan China demonstrated that women, nurses and frontline healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable to experiencing depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress in these work conditions [7].",

Medical journals should focus on streamlining publication of relevant materials in multiple languages on multiple platforms to dissemination critical information [10]. Education on how to emotionally support and work with patients experiencing significant mental health problems during the pandemic should also be made available, as well as access to refer patients to seek psychological treatment [9]. To prioritize safety, non-emergent health concerns, when feasible, should be addressed via telemedicine, and non-emergent procedures postponed [4]. Another major concern is what if the needs of a community surpass hospital capacity. To prepare for this, communities should have a backup force of able healthcare workers who are either retired, and even include students who are about to graduate. These workers should prepare to be activated in times of emergency or high volume [4]. Use of military resources including workers, hospitals and potentially even ships should be incorporated as needed. Employing military style triage could also help streamline patient care [4].",
