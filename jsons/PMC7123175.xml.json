Actually, different kinds of hazards nowadays contain effects from both the natural and human factors to different degrees.

This method can approximately reflect the regional overall hazard intensities in a certain space and a certain period of time. But there is one problem with this method; that is, different hazards with the same level of relative intensity might have different impacts on hazard-affected bodies.

The value ranges from below 0.04 to above 0.30. This large variation shows that there is an obvious spatial clustering feature of natural hazards in China. Generally speaking, the high values are centered in North China and decrease toward northeast, northwest, and southeast. Ninety percent of the districts and counties with HD value greater than 20% are located in the middle latitude belt (25\u00b0\u201345\u00b0N). In Southwest China where the HD values are relatively low, the HD value increases in some topography-transition areas. Thus, it can be seen that natural hazards relatively cluster in natural environment transition zones, such as the middle latitude belt, sea\u2013land transition zones, topography-transition areas, and semiarid farming\u2013pastoral ecotone. In the transition regions of several natural environments, there exist continuous areas with high HD values. North China is right in such location and thus becomes the most concentrated area of natural hazards in China, also an important part of the Pacific Rim and mid-latitude multiple hazard belt.

In this high-value region, the Northeast China Plain and the North China Plain have values usually greater than 9.0. The regions with HC values greater than 10 display a Lambda-shaped layout; that is, one line is Qiqihar\u2013Tongliao\u2013Beijing\u2013Taiyuan\u2013Baoji\u2013Tianshui, and the other line stretches from southern Hebei Province to Hangzhou along the Grand Canal. The low-value regions are centered in the Northern Tibetan Plateau, from which HC value increases outwards. In regions south of the Yangtze River, there are two high-value belts: southeast coastal belt and southwestern provinces including Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. There is a positive correlation between the HC value and the HD value. It can be seen from Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 that HC values and HD values share the same regional distribution, especially in North China, and the distributions of HC values and HD values are related to those of different kinds of natural hazards. Usually areas influenced by natural hazards of atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere tend to have relatively high HC values. Examples are the previously mentioned high-value regions including North China Plain, Northeast China Plain, and Loess Plateau, where meteorological, floods and biological hazards are concentrated and influence extensively.\n",

One high-intensity area (Hi > 16.0) stretches from the northeast to the southwest, and another one is in the southeastern side of the first one\u2014Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces. The relative intensities in the vast north-central Tibetan Plateau and Northwest China are relatively low. The regional differentiation of relative intensity is tightly associated with the regional distribution of several major hazards. First of all, the seismically active belts of China, i.e., the Pacific Rim belt and Himalayan seismic belt, have the correspondingly high intensities. Seismic regions, once having an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 8, usually become small high-intensity centers, such as West China, Tangshan. Secondly, the high-intensity regions are overlapped with the regions concentrated with cloudbursts. For example, the coastal typhoon belt, the northern Hebei Mountains\u2013Taihang Mountains\u2013Dabie Mountains cloudburst belt, and the cloudburst belts in western Sichuan and western Hunan. Thirdly, the frequently flooded areas also correspond to high relative intensity areas. These areas include Liaohe Plain, North China Plain, Northern Jiangsu Plain, and Hubei and Hunan Plains. Finally, areas with frequent debris flows and landslides, mainly in the \u201cSecond Step\u201d east to Tibetan Plateau, have high values of relative intensity. Therefore, the overall relative intensity of natural hazards is controlled by several major natural hazards. However, these major natural hazards may also interact in the same region, which makes the regional differentiation of relative intensity of China\u2019s natural hazards more complicated and also expands the high-intensity regions. In every high relative intensity area, there is at least one dominant natural hazard.\n",

A higher score means the hazard has a higher intensity. The world natural disaster hotspots identified by the World Bank are based on 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 grid cells for risk assessment.

Another example is the four public securities proposed by the Chinese government corresponding to five of the six risk categories of IRGC, that is, natural disaster of the former corresponds to the natural forces of the latter, accidental disasters to physical risks, public health accidents to chemical and biological risks, and social security incidents to social-communicative hazards.

For example, the meteorological, hydrological, and ocean disaster risks can be divided into 10-year level (small-scale disaster), 20-year level (medium-scale disaster), 50-year level (large-scale disaster), and 100-year level (very large-scale disaster). The earthquake disaster risk level is usually expressed in earthquake magnitude. For example, a magnitude 7.0 or above earthquake poses a very large-scale disaster risk, 6.5\u20137.0 large-scale, 6.0\u20136.5 medium-scale, and 6.0 or below small-scale disaster risks. The natural disaster risk level does not only depend on the natural hazard intensity but also count on the vulnerability and exposure of the hazard-bearing bodies. In practice, the classification of natural disaster risk levels is even more complicated and thus usually resorts to the relative levels such as the first-level risk, the second-level risk, the third-level risk, the fourth-level risk, and the fifth-level risk. The larger the number is, the higher the risk level is. In the Atlas of Natural Disaster Risk of China by Peijun Shi (Chinese\u2013English bilingual version, Shi 2011) and the World Atlas of Natural Disaster Risk by Peijun Shi and Roger Kasperson (Shi et al. 2015), the temporal and spatial patterns of natural disaster risks of China and the world are displayed by using indicators including risks, risk grades, and risk levels (Qin et al. 2015; Shi 2011, 2015).",

In short, disaster risk science is a discipline studying the mechanics, processes, and dynamics of the interactions among hazards, disasters, and risks, as well as disaster risk prevention and reduction. The relationships among hazards, disasters, and risks are shown in Fig. 1.7.\n",

Affected crop area is the crop area that has a reduction of more than 10% of production. Crop disaster area is the crop area that has a reduction of more than 30% of production. Crop disaster ratio is the ratio of crop disaster area over affected crop area. Population affected is the number of people who suffer from losses caused by natural disasters (including non-permanent residents). Disaster population is the population that are affected by the crop disaster. In this table, it is estimated from the crop disaster area and the cultivated area per capita in the disaster province. Population in need of aids is the number of people who are directly affected by natural disasters and are in need of food and water supply or medical treatment from the government (including non-permanent residents). Population in need of aids ratio is the ratio of population in need of aids to the population affected. Direct economic loss is the value of depreciated of the disaster-bearing bodies or the value of the disaster-bearing bodies forfeited.
