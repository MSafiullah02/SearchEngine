The authors found that increased likelihood of exposure to the virus, increased susceptibility to severe consequences of the infection, and lack of health care access were all important contributors, and they concluded with pointed, domainspecific recommendations to mitigate these disparities. The clarity of this path forward would be alluring and reassuring were the historical nature of these observations not so alarming. These data are not based on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; rather, they describe the nation's experience of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

Minority communities are more likely to be exposed to the virus because they are overrepresented in the low-wage, essential workforce at the front lines, including low-wage health care workers who often move between clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes to make a living, thereby magnifying their risk (5) . Poor communities may face challenges implementing social distancing because of housing density and overcrowding, and minority populations are overrepresented in congregate settings, such as homeless shelters and prisons, that increase exposure risk. Minority communities may be more susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19 because of existing disparities in underlying conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 mortality, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. Although largely preventable or amenable to medical management, these chronic conditions are more common, less likely to be controlled, and more likely to occur at younger ages in these communities. Health care access is also a probable contributor to COVID-19 mortality given the limited availability of both testing and treatments. Much of the testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has occurred in the context of a health care evaluation, resulting in barriers for those without insurance. Although data are not yet available, concerns about the equitable distribution of ventilators and treatments have also been raised.",

This time must be different because the increasing diversity of the U.S. population and our essential workers reminds us of our interdependence and means that focusing on minority communities is essential both to relieve suffering in these communities and to effectively manage this crisis.

During the 1970s, the gap in measles vaccination rates between minority and white children was as high as 18 percentage points. Consequently, the U.S. measles epidemic of 1989 to 1991 that resulted in more than 55 000 cases included 4-to 7-fold higher rates among minority children than white children. Today, gaps in measles vaccination rates by race and ethnicity are nonexistent thanks in part to a dual strategy of boosting universal childhood vaccination and implementing targeted measures in minority communities. These targeted approaches have included increased funding to urban health departments; development of local action This article was published at Annals.org on 28 April 2020.",

Unfortunately, influenza vaccinations and most other adult vaccinations have not seen similar success. Although influenza vaccination rates improved in the 2018 to 2019 season compared with prior years, the rate overall was only 45.3% (far short of the 70% goal of Healthy People 2020), and rates were substantially lower among African American, Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native adults (7) . Achieving the desired population benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will require an implementation strategy that addresses the current gaps in overall rates of adult vaccination, as well as specific issues in minority communities. Establishing and nurturing trust and partnerships within affected communities will be critical because diminished trust in health care borne from a legacy of unethical experimentation, including the Tuskegee study, has been identified as an important contributor to vaccine hesitancy among African Americans (8, 9) .",
