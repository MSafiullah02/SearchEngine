            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) proteins, membrane proteins (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins, and has been classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Motokawa et al., 1995). Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats, whereas FIPV infection has been shown to cause FIP (Pedersen, 2009). FIPV has been proposed to arise from FECV due to a mutation (Brown, 2011, Chang et al., 2010, Chang et al., 2012); however, the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. Therefore, no reliable method has been established to distinguish FIPV and FECV.",

Although exudate can be used to diagnose FIP in cats, accompanied by ascites and pleural effusion, not all cats with FIP retain exudate. Therefore, a biopsy is necessary for the antemortem diagnosis of FIP without exudate retention. Tru-cut and fine needle biopsies are minimally invasive, highly specific diagnostic methods; however, their sensitivity is low (Giordano et al., 2005). FIP has typically been diagnosed comprehensively based on the clinical condition, hematological profile, and results of FCoV genomic RNA and FCoV-antibody measurements in cats suspected of FIP (Addie et al., 2009). An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunochromatographic assay (ICA) are currently used to measure FCoV-antibodies. IFA and ELISA are highly sensitive and specific, but are also cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. ICA is a simple antibody detection method, the results of which can be rapidly obtained at a low cost. However, the sensitivity of commercially available ICA test kits to detect the FCoV antibody was shown to be low (Meli et al., 2013).",

When an outbreak of virulent FCoV (FIPV) infection occurs in these environments, most cats in the environment are likely to develop FIP (Wang et al., 2013). An accurate and rapid test method is necessary to prevent an epidemic of FCoV infection. A low-cost FCoV test method is also needed to measure feline FCoV antibodies in animals maintained in multi-cat environments. The most appropriate diagnostic method meeting these conditions may be ICA. The detection of anti-FCoV antibodies using ICA requires no special device or reagent, and the results can be simply and rapidly obtained. Several ICA test kits to detect anti-FCoV antibodies are currently available commercially; however, their reactivity is lower than those of IFA and ELISA (Meli et al., 2013).",

The development of simple antibody test methods using the principle of ICA (CJNP/TPA) is expected for other coronavirus and feline viral infections.",
