They can infect a number of hosts of various species such as birds, rodents and primates. Four distinct polyomaviruses \u2013 JC (John Cunningham) virus, BK virus, KI (Karolinska Institute) virus and WU (Washington University) virus \u2013 have been reported to infect humans. Both JC virus and BK virus were discovered in 1971 (Gardner et al., 1971 and Padgett et al., 1971) and are genetically closely related to each other. They usually cause asymptomatic infections; yet, they can become oncogenic or induce disease in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients (Khalili et al., 2006, Hirsch et al., 2006, Fioriti et al., 2005).",

Thus, KI and WU polyomaviruses were reported as novel viruses potentially causing respiratory disease in humans. However, both KI and WU polyomaviruses were frequently co-detected with other respiratory viruses. Moreover, a previous study reported that no evidence for an aetiological link between KI or WU polyomavirus infections and respiratory disease (Norja et al., 2007). Therefore, the clinical significance of KI and WU polyomaviruses requires further investigation. This study was aimed at establishing prevalence and clinical association of KI and WU polyomavirus infections in children with respiratory disease in Thailand.

These two regions are separated by a regulatory non-coding region that contains typical polyomavirus characteristics (Allander et al., 2007 and Gaynor et al., 2007). Based on complete genome analysis, the WU/KI polyomaviruses isolated from Thai patients were closely related to the isolates described in previous reports (Gaynor et al., 2007, Allander et al., 2007 and Bialasiewicz et al., 2007). This may be due to the fact that both WU and KI polyomaviruses are DNA viruses which are less error prone in the DNA replication process. However, there were numerous nucleotide variations within the non-coding regulatory regions as well as several non-synonymous mutations within coding regions.",

However, these viruses may not be the causative agents of clinical respiratory disease and their presence in the respiratory tract may simply reflect their mode of transmission similar to other polyomaviruses in humans such as JCV and BKV. Nevertheless, most known human viruses are pathogenic in certain conditions and thus, novel viruses must be considered as potential pathogens. Various degrees of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to mild and severe illness depend on several factors, such as the host's immune status and age, the virus strain, viral load and mode of transmission. The 10-nucleotide insertion and several nucleotide sequence variations within non-coding regulatory regions as well as various non-synonymous mutations within the coding regions should be taken into consideration as factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of these novel viruses. The difficulty with persisting viruses is that they are often discovered out their symptomatic context, so that judging the association of WU/KI polyomavirus infections with a particular disease will be challenging and require further extensive case control investigations.",
