These fragments served as templates in a single PCR reaction in the presence of the universal primer T7 (5\u2032\u2010GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC\u20103\u2032) and two mutagenic primers which contained an overlapping region of 19 nucleotides. The PCR products were loaded onto a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and purified using the JetSorb Purification Kit (Genomed). The presence of the mutation and the absence of nonspecific mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing by an Applied Biosystems 371 automated sequencer using fluorescent ddNTPs (ABI). Sequence analysis was performed using the program macmolly tetra (SoftGene GmbH). Each mutant was then subcloned back to the wild\u2010type plasmid pBs II KS+/rat TRH\u2010DE.",

From the alignment of the amino\u2010acid sequences we speculated that Cys68, the only Cys residue of the N\u2010terminal peptide fragment that could be left in the membrane after trypsin cleavage, might be involved in disulfide\u2010linked dimerization. Therefore, the wild\u2010type and the C68S mutant were fused in\u2010frame C\u2010terminal of the FLAG\u2010epitope of pFLAG\u2010CMV1 (see Experimental procedures) and expressed in BHK\u2010cells. Membrane fractions from BHK\u2010cells expressing the wild\u2010type or the mutant enzyme were subjected to SDS/PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak). Under reducing conditions (1.5% dithiothreitol), a band of immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa could be detected for both proteins, the wild\u2010type and the C68S mutant (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). Under nonreducing conditions, the same band was also visualized for the C68S mutant (Fig. 4A, lane 6) but not for the wild\u2010type protein (Fig. 4A, lane 5), which migrated as a high molecular mass protein. These data are compatible with the interpretation that the mutant enzyme may exist as a monomeric fusion protein, while the wild\u2010type protein represents a disulfide\u2010linked homodimer. This hypothesis is further supported by the analysis of the proteolytically truncated, catalytically fully active ectoenzyme from rat brain. Under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, this protein migrates on SDS/PAGE as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa (Fig. 4B) indicating that other cysteine residues are not involved in dimer formation. To analyze whether the homodimer formation via the Cys68 S\u2010S bridges might contribute to the stability of TRH\u2010DE, we studied the temperature\u2010dependant inactivation of the wild\u2010type and the C68S mutant but found no difference (Fig. 5).",

As part of an intrachain S\u2010S bridge, this cysteine apparently contributes to establishing the tertiary structure of the active pocket. On the basis of the high substrate specificity of TRH\u2010DE, we assumed that replacement of Cys444 by serine might \u2018open\u2019 the active pocket and thus might result in an enzyme that could hydrolyze different substrates other than TRH. However, with pyroglutamyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide, a low affinity substrate that is slowly hydrolyzed by TRH\u2010DE, release of \u03b2\u2010naphthylamine by the mutant enzyme could not be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, LH\u2010RH, a decapeptideamide with the sequence pyroGlu\u2010His\u2010Trp\u2010Ser\u2010Tyr\u2010Gly\u2010Leu\u2010Arg\u2010Pro\u2010Gly is also not hydrolyzed by the mutant enzyme (data not shown). LH\u2010RH was tested because this peptide is not hydrolyzed by TRH\u2010DE, yet it is apparently recognized by the enzyme as the degradation of TRH by TRH\u2010DE is effectively inhibited by this peptide [13].",

            "text": "In contrast to the cysteines constituting the catalytic domain, Cys68, which resides very close to the membrane surface (just four residues away from the hydrophobic membrane\u2010spanning region), could be substituted by serine without affecting significantly the specific activity of the mutant enzyme. This cysteine is positioned within the presumed stalk region, a stretch of about 40 amino\u2010acid residues that is a general feature of ectoenzymes and is thought to be important for surface exposition [38]. The hypothesis that this stretch forms a separate domain is supported by the fact that in TRH\u2010DE [21], as in other enzymes such as in aminopeptidase N (reviewed in [39]), this region is considerably less conserved than the catalytic domain. As in aminopeptidase A [31, 32], this cysteine is obviously responsible for intersubunit S\u2010S bridging and thus for the formation of the homodimeric wild\u2010type TRH\u2010DE. Surprisingly, however, covalent dimerization seems not to be essential for the formation and expression of the catalytically active enzyme. Moreover, as also shown with the truncated mutant protein in which the catalytic domain was replaced by GFP, the intermolecular disulfide link via Cys68 appeared not to be essential for trafficking and transport of the protein to the cell surface. In agreement with these results are the data of previous biochemical studies on the dimeric assembly of enterocyte brush border enzymes (e.g. aminopeptidase N and A, dipeptidyl peptidase IV) which demonstrated that homodimerization is not an absolute requirement for transport of these enzymes to, and through, the Golgi complex [40] although dimeric assembly may increase the rate of intracellular transport. For the mouse meprin peptidase, site\u2010directed mutagenesis studies also demonstrated that the covalent dimerization of subunits is not essential for efficient biosynthesis, trafficking or post\u2010translational processing of the secreted protease [33]. Moreover, for membrane dipeptidase, another enzyme with a single disulfide bond close to the membrane surface, mutation of the critical cysteine residue to glycine neither influenced the expression of the mutant enzyme to the cell surface nor the enzymatic properties of the peptidase [35].",
