Common methods for plant virus detection include variations of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serological assays such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody tests and metagenomic approaches (Melcher et al., 2008, Menzel et al., 2002, Webster et al., 2004). PCR-based techniques have improved tremendously and are preferred often for definitive identification of the causative agent. These molecular techniques, whether protein or nucleic acid based, have limitations, including a requirement for prior knowledge or presumption regarding identities of viruses present in samples and detection restriction to a limited number of candidate viruses. Perhaps more importantly, most of these techniques lack the ability to detect novel viruses. For broad-spectrum identification of plant viruses, there is a need for complementary and comprehensive multi-targeted approaches for virus detection.",

Arrays have been developed for the detection of animal and plant pathogens (Jaaskelainen and Maunula, 2006, Seifarth et al., 2003, Sengupta et al., 2003, Wilson et al., 2002), including a remarkable application of the technique in identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus as a member of the genus Coronavirus (Wang et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2003). Fewer arrays have been developed for the detection of plant viruses, the earliest of which were for the detection and discrimination between potato virus isolates (Boonham et al., 2003). Early arrays consisted of PCR products amplified from cDNA libraries (Boonham et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003) and were improved later using high purity artificially synthesized oligonucleotides (Bystricka et al., 2005, Deyong et al., 2005). Oligonucleotide probes of 20\u201370 nt have been used successfully depending upon the desired level of detection specificity (Bystricka et al., 2005, Deyong et al., 2005, Pasquini et al., 2008).",

Secondary structure formation in longer targets can cause a decrease in hybridization efficiency by reducing the binding constant with probes by 105 to 106-fold, increasing false-negative signals (Lima et al., 1992). To mitigate the effects of target secondary structure hindrances, determination of an optimum target length and optimized technical conditions are critical to achieve an efficient and discriminating hybridization. A recent study (Liu et al., 2007) examined the effects of target length on hybridization efficiency using different length targets against Escherichia coli gene probes. Unfortunately, effects of both target and probe length on hybridization specificity and detection sensitivity in plant virus detection studies have not been investigated.",

In case of microarrays for RNA viruses occurring at high concentrations, labeled cDNA targets can be generated by direct (Boonham et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003) or indirect (Bystricka et al., 2005, Pasquini et al., 2008) incorporation of the label during reverse transcription reactions using random primers, without amplification. However, for viruses present in lower titers, target amplification is needed to increase the probability of virus detection. The use of group or genus-specific primers (Deyong et al., 2005, Sugiyama et al., 2008) for amplification of viral sequences is not suitable for detection of emerging unknown viruses. In addition, there are many groups of plant viruses for which no effective generic primers are available due to extreme nucleotide sequence variability of genomes. Thus, there is a significant need for the application of sequence-independent amplification methods for detection of plant viruses, especially when prior information about the identity of the virus(es) is not available. A method developed for non-specific amplification of DNA (Bohlander et al., 1992) was modified recently and used in a macroarray system for detection of plant RNA viruses (Agindotan and Perry, 2007).",

Though the method was validated using either VNA or total RNA as substrates, VNA has a twofold advantage for detection of encapsidated viruses. First, targets derived from VNA, isolated from virus-like particles, will contain lower proportions of host-derived nucleic acids reducing the background and improving target specificity and sensitivity of hybridization. Second, VNA, as the substrate for random amplification, targets both DNA and RNA plant viruses. This study describes the validation of an array constituting both short and long oligonucleotide probes using tymoviruses as model pathogens. Tymoviruses were chosen for the study because they are one of the most prominent viral genera present in non-cultivated plants of the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve of northeastern Oklahoma (Min et al., unpublished results, Muthukumar et al., 2009). Initial experiments were performed with Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV, GenBank accession no. U03387) and Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV, GenBank accession no. M90541) to examine the effects of probe and target length variations on hybridization efficiency.",

The strategy employed to convert viral RNA or DNA into a form suitable for hybridization to detect viral sequences is shown in Fig. 1\n. The sequence-independent amplification method described previously (Bohlander et al., 1992, Wang et al., 2002) was modified slightly to make amplified targets from mixed populations of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA and DNA. VNA obtained from plant tissues was reverse-transcribed using an SP6 anchor primer with twelve 3\u2032-end random nucleotides (5\u2032-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAN12). The second strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using two rounds of Sequenase (USB, Cleveland, OH, USA), which also can synthesize cDNA from viral DNA genomes. The double-stranded cDNA was then PCR-amplified for 30 cycles using the SP6 anchor primer (5\u2032-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA) with Taq polymerase. To incorporate the SP6 promoter on the 5\u2032-ends of TYMV and KYMV cDNAs obtained by reverse-transcription using random hexamers, another round of PCR amplification was performed using SP6-N12 random primer and SP6 primer. To prepare targets for labeling, aminoallyl UTP was incorporated into all three PCR-amplified cDNA samples by in vitro RNA transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase using the MEGAscript\u2122 high yield transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h. The synthesized cRNA mixture was treated with DNase to remove template cDNA, purified using a Mega Clear\u2122 kit (Ambion), dried and suspended in 10 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water.",

Five probes of different lengths (TV3781-21, TV3781-24, TV3781-27, TV3781-30 and TV3781-50) were designed from within the conserved 70-mer TVCV probe (10003781). TVCV-specific spacer-probes were designed with a run of 20 consecutive thymidylates (T20) to provide separation of the hybridization sequence from the substrate. Spacers were located at 3\u2032 (TV3781-30-T20) or 5\u2032 (T20-TV3781-30) ends of the 30-mer probe. Three short 30-mer probes corresponding to Marafivirus (Marafi.4636), Alphacryptovirus (Acrypto2.66) and Furovirus (Furo1.773) were designed with and without a spacer at their 3\u2032-ends. Short probes specific for Ambrosia asymptomatic virus 1, AAV1 (Melcher et al., 2008) were designed with no spacer or 5-, 10- and 20-mer thymidylate spacers at their 3\u2032-ends. All the short TVCV-specific probes were plus-sense probes. Plus-sense probes represent the plus-sense viral sequence which will bind to the complementary minus-sense viral RNA of the incoming target sample. Conversely, minus-sense probes will bind to complementary plus-sense viral RNA. Ten plus-sense and ten minus-sense virus-specific short probes with terminal oligo-d(T) spacers were designed for the novel tymovirus, AsAV. In this study, the term \u201cvirus-specific\u201d indicates that probe design was based on a specific virus sequence and that its hybridization will not necessarily discriminate against other closely related species. Hence, cross-hybridization to these probes by targets from related species of viruses was both expected and observed. The ten minus-sense virus-specific short probes for AsAV were designed both with and without spacers for comparison purposes. Five plus- and minus-sense pairs for each of the 50- and 70-mer virus-specific probes were designed for each of the three species: AsAV (Min et al., unpublished results), KYMV (GenBank accession no. D00637) and TYMV (GenBank accession no. XI6378). The complete genome sequences of these species were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994). Regions of high sequence similarity for the three species were identified from alignments and used to design long oligonucleotide probes. The 50-mer probes were designed internal to the 70-mer probes for all three species.",

In all experiments, the fluorescence value of an oligonucleotide was required to be at least twenty times above the average background signal to be considered positive. Short degenerate probes did not show detectable signals with any of the target lengths for either of the two species (Fig. 2\n). On the other hand, the longer 10003781 TVCV probe produced a positive hybridization signal with the TVCV target but not with the CaMV target, while the opposite was true for the CaMV probe 1000830, indicating the expected specificity had occurred. Positive signals were strongest with shorter TVCV and CaMV targets (100 and 92 bp, respectively).",

Once again, the longer target (300 bp) produced hybridization signals close to background with all of the six different length probes (Fig. 3\n). Shorter targets (100 bp) did not produce strong hybridizations with shorter probes but the hybridization efficiency improved approximately fivefold as the probe length increased from 21 to 70 nt. To explain the consistent higher hybridization efficiency patterns observed with longer targets, the relationship between the targets\u2019 hybridization efficiencies and overall Gibbs free energies (\u03b4), which consider the occurrences of secondary structures in the DNA targets, was evaluated. As calculated using the DNA mfold server (Zuker, 2003), the negative values of \u03b4 for 300 and 1000 bp targets were twice and seven times lower than for the 100 bp target, respectively. Furthermore, both of the longer targets contain an additional sequence capable of forming a hairpin whose loop could pair in pseudoknot fashion with sequence complementary to the probe used. The observed hybridization inefficiency of probes with longer targets may thus be due to formation of secondary structures in longer DNA targets, which is a well documented factor affecting probe binding for both DNA and RNA molecules (Lima et al., 1992, Liu et al., 2007, Peplies et al., 2003, Southern et al., 1999). The superior hybridization of TV3781-50 relative to shorter probes could be due to its substantially higher calculated melting temperature (T\nm, 66 \u00b0C vs. 53\u201358 \u00b0C) or to its extra length. The extra length could circumvent possibly limited accessibility of short surface-bound DNA probes to targets.",

To find an optimum spacer length, oligo-d(T) spacers of different lengths (5, 10 and 20-mers) were attached on an AAVl-specific probe. The probes were hybridized to the complementary target synthesized after virus purification from Ambrosia psilostachya (Melcher et al., 2008). The results showed that 20-mer spacer length produced the strongest and most specific hybridization signals (data not shown). Further experiments were performed using the selected 20-mer oligo-d(T) spacer. TVCV cDNA targets of 100 and 300 bp were hybridized to probes TV3781-30, T20-TV3781-30 and TV3781-30-T20, providing no spacer, a 5\u2032-end T20 spacer and a 3\u2032-end T20 spacer, respectively. No effect was observed on the hybridization efficiency of the longer target (300 bp) when hybridized to TVCV-specific spacer-probes, whereas the hybridization efficiency of the shorter target (100 bp) improved with spacer-probes (Fig. 4\n). The signal intensity of the shorter target with probe TV3781-30-T20 was 6.2-fold higher than that of the same probe without the spacer, whereas the signal for probe T20TV3781-30 increased only 2.5-fold relative to the non-spacer probe, indicating that spacers were optimal when placed on the 3\u2032-end. Although the calculated T\nm values for T V3781-30-T20 and T20-TV3781-30 are the same, and slightly higher (<3 \u00b0C) than that of TV3781-30, there was a significant difference among the hybridization efficiencies of these three probes, suggesting that the increased hybridization efficiency was due not to an effect of T\nm, but to the increased length of the probe. To ensure that the increase in intensities were not due to non-specific hybridization of targets to the spacer, hybridization intensities of targets to three target-irrelevant probes (Marafi.4636, Acrypto2.66 and Furol.773) were compared with and without 3\u2032-end spacers. Regardless of the presence or absence of spacers, these probes produced intensities less than 20% of target-specific probes with spacers at either ends. Together the results suggested that the hybridization efficiency of short probes could be improved to produce detectable and specific signals by addition of oligo-d(T) spacers at 3\u2032-ends. These findings were in agreement with similar previous reports using spacers with different slide chemistries (Chou et al., 2004, Peplies et al., 2003, Southern et al., 1999).",

Fig. 6A shows the compiled results from five individual hybridizations. The cRNA target from an uninfected plant did not hybridize with any of the viral probes on the array.

For AsAV and TYMV targets, all specific long probes hybridized strongly to their respective viral targets. In contrast, only three out of five KYMV probe pairs (50 and 70-mers) were able to detect the target species. The other two probe-pairs (KYMV2-50M/KYMV2-70M and KYMV4-50M/KYMV4-70M) produced signals below the detection threshold and did not qualify as positives. These two probe pairs were not considered in further analyses.

The uninfected sample did not hybridize with any viral probe on the array (Fig. 6B). The decrease in hybridization temperature was accompanied by a decrease in signal intensities of target-specific long oligonucleotide probes. The temperature decrease did not result in positive hybridization to KYMV2 and KYMV4 probes, false negatives at 60 \u00b0C. However, a variation in sensitivity of hybridization between 50-mers vs. 70-mers was observed at 46 \u00b0C. The average ratio of mean median intensities for 70 to 50-mer probes rose to 1.6 for 86% (13/15) of the probe pairs when hybridized at 46 \u00b0C compared to an average of 1.1 when hybridized at 60 \u00b0C. Two of the probe pairs AsAV2 50 M vs. AsAV2 70 M and TYMV1 50 M vs. TYMV1 70 M, hybridized to their targets at 46 \u00b0C, with almost equally strong signals. Concurrent with a decrease in the hybridization temperature, the percentage of heterologous probes producing hybridization signals greater than 35% of the strongest signal for that probe also increased from 34% (9/26) to 46% (11/26) in the case of 50-mer probes and from 46% (12/26) to 57% (15/26) in the case of 70-mer probes. Thus, comparison of hybridizations performed at two different temperatures showed that hybridization performed at 60 \u00b0C produced more sensitive and specific detection signals.",

The oligonucleotide probes attached to polycarbodiimide-coated slides are bound most likely via thiamine bases forming covalent bonds in the presence of UV irradiation (Kimura et al., 2004). Thus, it is possible that immobilized DNA containing thymine bases on polycarbodiimide-coated slides may limit oligonucleotide accessibility to the DNA target. This risk is higher presumably for smaller immobilized probes than longer probes. The use of terminal thymidylate spacers produced an improvement in the hybridization efficiency of shorter probes. Although the exact mechanism is not proven, the suggested hypothesis is that the spacers are extending these probe sequences away from the slide surface, making the probes accessible for interaction with the target. Another benefit of oligothymidylate spacers is that the spacer itself decreases the possibility that a thymidine internal to the virus sequence will be used for attachment.",

Shorter fragments of around 100 bp target length produced stronger hybridization signals on the array than longer targets for both TVCV and CaMV species. The observations above suggest that stronger signals could be due to secondary structure formation in the longer target strands making the target regions inaccessible to probes. The present results were in agreement with a recent study using E. coli 16S rRNA gene probes which showed enhanced hybridization with PCR amplicons of less than 150 bp and fragmented rRNA between 20 and 100 nt (Liu et al., 2007). In summary, these results contributed to the establishment of efficient probe design and target synthesis strategy to improve the sensitivity and specificity of virus detection for the microarray format. The method described herein provides a viable procedure for nucleic acid amplification and hybridization that should be effective in detecting most plant RNA or DNA viruses as long as the virus has representative sequence information available. In it, viral nucleic acid concentrations for hybridization are increased by preliminary particle enrichment and by synthesis of in vitro transcribed cRNA containing aminoallyl moieties. In previous reports using microarrays to detect plant viruses, labeling of targets produced using random primers was either achieved by incorporation of labeled nucleotides during reverse transcription of the total RNA (Boonham et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003) or using indirect fluorochrome labeling (Bystricka et al., 2005, Pasquini et al., 2008). These procedures did not include a PCR amplification step that could increase the sensitivity of this technique. Direct incorporation of the fluorophore at the reverse transcription step can result in a lower amount of DNA obtained than by indirect labeling, due to poor incorporation of fluorophore-labeled nucleotides into DNA during polymerization. Combining sequence-independent target amplification and in vitro transcription with indirect labeling ensures a highly efficient label incorporation as well as sufficient target yield of the final cRNA product. A fragmentation step was added to decrease the formation of possible secondary structures in labeled cRNA target molecules and increase the diffusion rate of the target molecules.",

Hence, a potential exists for the utilization of longer probes for detection of viruses at higher taxonomic levels like genus or family level, along with shorter probes for discrimination between closely related viral species or strains. The study successfully validated the use of both long and short probes (with spacers) under the described hybridization method and conditions. Comparison was made also between the two types of long probes (50-mers vs. 70-mers) under two different hybridization temperatures using three Tymovirus species. An augmentation in hybridization signals occurred with an increase in hybridization temperature (60 \u00b0C). It could be explained by the destabilization of secondary structures within target molecules, increasing their accessibility to probes. These results disagree with an earlier report (Chou et al., 2004) that observed a reduction in hybridization signal intensities at higher hybridization temperatures (50 and 63 \u00b0C) for both 50- and 70-mer probes. One explanation for this discrepancy could be the excellent signal-to-noise ratio provided by the polycarbodiimide slide chemistry (Kimura et al., 2004). The results demonstrate the use of 50-mer oligonucleotide probes as an attractive choice, especially for plant virus detection studies given the inherent nucleotide variability in genomes of most plant viruses. The 50-mer probes can produce an ideal balance between probe sensitivity and specificity making the assay specific enough, but not too specific to overlook closely related viral species.",

First, the reproducible absence of false hybridization by targets prepared from uninfected plant samples made the interpretation of results simple and reliable. Second, all three individual species used in this report were readily detected by hybridizations to the appropriate oligonucleotides without any non-specific hybridization to unrelated viral probes. Virus-specific hybridizations produced strong signals for multiple virus-specific probes providing explicit interpretations. Since the probe design for all long oligonucleotide probes was focused on regions conserved among the three species, it was not surprising to observe some cross-hybridizations between heterologous species. Indeed, they demonstrated the ability of the array to detect and differentiate between closely related uncharacterized plant viruses. Third, signature sequences of all three viral species were detected readily in the mixed viral target validating the feasibility of our microarray for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in a single plant sample.",
