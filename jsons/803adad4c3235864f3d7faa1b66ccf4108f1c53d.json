Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process by which host cells remove protein aggregates and damaged organelles for maintaining cellular homeostasis [5] . The autophagic cascade starts with engulfment of cytoplasmic cargo by an autophagosome, which then fuses with an endosome to form an autolysosome, exposing the inner compartment to lysosomal hydrolases for degradation [6] . It has been demonstrated that stresses, such as nutrient starvation and pathogenic infection, can also induce autophagy [7, 8] . Many protein factors that are important for autophagy have been identified. The microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3), as one of these factors, is often used as Abstract During dengue virus (DENV) infection, the virus manipulates different cellular pathways to assure productive replication, including autophagy. However, it remains unclear how this autophagic process is regulated. Here, we have demonstrated a novel role for the microRNA miR-146a in negatively regulating the cellular autophagic pathway in DENV-infected A549 cells and THP-1 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a significantly blocked DENV2-induced autophagy, and LNA-mediated inhibition of miR-146a counteracted these effects. Moreover, co-overexpression of TRAF6, a target of miR-146a, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-146a on autophagy. Notably, treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 fully restored the autophagic activity in TRAF6-silenced cells. Furthermore, our data Jieying Pu and Siyu Wu contributed equally to this work.",

When cells undergo autophagy, the lipidation process promotes the conversion of LC3-I to its lipidated form LC3-II and allows it to localize to autophagosomal membranes [10] . In addition, the unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex and the beclin 1/class III phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) complex are both important components of autophagy [11] . Several recent studies have shown a role for autophagy in the interaction between host cells and viruses. During viral infection, autophagy can perform either a pro-viral or an anti-viral function. On one hand, autophagy may be an important antiviral defense mechanism of the innate immune system, presumably by degrading sequestered viral structures to help reduce virus replication [12] [13] [14] . On the other hand, many viruses, such as poliovirus, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and DENV, have been reported to subvert the autophagic process for their own replication strategy [3, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Studies from several groups have demonstrated that autophagy is required for efficient DENV replication [3, [19] [20] [21] , and autophagy contributes to robust DENV replication by altering cellular lipid metabolism to generate ATP, which produces a favorable replication environment for DENV [22] . However, all of these studies were undertaken primarily in liver cell lines, such as Huh7 and HepG2. Other authors found that, in marked contrast to these studies, induction of autophagy reduced DENV2 yield in the monocytic cell line, U937 [23] . This suggests that the DENV-autophagy interaction is mediated in a celltype-specific manner, and the role of autophagy in DENV replication remains controversial.",

However, it is still unclear how this autophagic process is regulated. Recently, a group of novel gene regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs), have been reported to play important roles in regulating autophagy. miRNAs are short (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that are endogenously expressed in various organisms from plants to mammals. They control biological events through binding to the 3'-untraslational region (UTR) of target mRNA to induce degradation or suppress its translation [30] . Recent studies have shown that a number of miRNAs, such as miR-30a [31] , miR-155 [32, 33] , miR-181A [34] , miR-376b [35] , and miR-100 [36] , are capable of regulating autophagic activity by targeting key autophagy proteins. However, whether miRNAs regulate DENV-induced autophagy in similar ways remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that miR-146a is an important host factor in facilitating DENV replication through targeting the key innate adaptor TRAF6 in monocytic cells [37] , but it remains unknown whether miR-146a has an impact on other DENV-induced biological processes, such as autophagy.",

We found that overexpression of miR-146a significantly blocks DENV2-induced autophagy in A549 cells and THP-1 cells and that silencing of miR-146a increases autophagy. These alterations in autophagy are exerted through targeting TRAF6, a target of miR-146a. Further studies showed that autophagy enhances the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-146a negatively regulates DENV-induced autophagy by targeting TRAF6, and this might help to uncover previously unknown signaling pathways related to the host's response to DENV infection.",

To confirm the role of miR-146a in autophagy activity, we employed bafilomycin A1, an antagonist of vacuolar H+ ATPase, to prevent luminal acidification and degradation of autophagosomal cargo. The results showed that, in the presence of bafilomycin A1, the amount of LC3-II was decreased after transfection with miR-146a mimic in A549 cells (Fig. 3A) , while inhibition of miR-146a by LNA-146a increased the amount of LC3-II (Fig. 3B) , as calculated based on the relative integrated density values ( Fig. 3A and B, right panel) .We also carried out an immunofluorescence assay to observe LC3 puncta formation, which is another indicator of autophagy. Cells were co-stained for DENV2 NS1 protein to show that LC3 puncta formation correlates with DENV2 infection. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, DENV2-infected A549 cells showed specific staining for viral protein NS1, suggesting the cells were efficiently infected. Consistent with the Western blot data shown in Fig. 1 , obtained from, DENV2 infection significantly increased the percentage of LC3-puncta-positive cells (around 35%, Fig. 3C ), whereas the formation of LC3 puncta was reduced in miR-146a-overexpressing cells (around 18% positive cells, Fig. 3C ). Moreover, a significant increase in the percentage of LC3-puncta-positive cells was seen in the LNA-146a-transfected sample (around 45%, Fig. 3D ).

Two proteins, ATG12 and TRAF6, were predicted to be its targets. Our Western blot data showed that miR-146a overexpression did not affect the expression level of ATG12, a key autophagy protein, while overexpression of miR-146a significantly decreased the protein level of TRAF6 (Fig. 4A,left panel) . Likewise, inhibition of miR-146 by LNA-146a increased the expression level of TRAF6, without changing ATG12 expression (Fig. 4A, right panel) . TRAF6 an identified target of miR-146a [37] , has been reported to be involved in other autophagy signaling pathways [40, 41] . To test whether Fig. 1 miR-146a inhibits autophagic activity in DENV2infected A549 cells. miR-146a was overexpressed in A549 cells by transfecting them with an miR-146a mimic (10 nM) for 24 h, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA level of miR-146a (A). miR-146a was silenced in A549 cells by transfecting them with LNA-146a (50 nM) for 24 h, and the relative miR-146a mRNA level was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (B). After miR-146a was overexpressed (C) or silenced (D), A549 cells were infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1) for 24 h, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was examined by Western blot. The percentage of LC3-II / (LC3-I+LC3-II) was calculated as shown beside the representative blot. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 h. An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect LC3 puncta formation in mock-infected or DENV2-infected cells. The percentage of LC3 dot-positive cells was determined. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 TRAF6 plays a role in DENV2-induced autophagy, the extent of autophagy was compared in TRAF6-silenced cells and control cells by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The efficacy of siRNA against TRAF6 was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4B) . Conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the percentage of LC3-puncta-positive cells stimulated by DENV2 infection were significantly decreased in TRAF6-silenced A549 cells ( Fig. 4B and C) . These results suggest that TRAF6 might be involved in DENV2-induced autophagy.",

To investigate whether autophagy regulates DENV2 replication in A549 cells, rapamycin, a potent inducer of autophagy, was used. We first confirmed the effect of rapamycin on autophagy in A549 cells by Western blot; an increase in the amount of LC3-II was observed after rapamycin treatment when compared to the control (Fig. 6A) . Then, the effects of rapamycin on DENV2 replication were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and TCID 50 assay. Both viral RNA and progeny viral titer were comparable between rapamycin-stimulated cells and control cells ( Fig. 6B and C) . Furthermore, A549 cells were treated with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA.

In this study, we identified a new function for miR-146a in regulating DENV2-induced autophagy. Two different cell lines (A549 and THP-1) were used. The monocytic cell line THP-1 was used as a substitute for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to mimic in vivo infection [50] . The lung epithelial cell line A549 has high susceptibility to DENV infection and has been widely used in DENV studies [51] [52] [53] [54] , but the DENV-autophagy interaction in A549 cells remains unclear. Therefore, A549 was the main cell line used in our study. Overexpression of miR-146a inhibited DENV2induced LC3-I-to-LC3-II conversion and LC3 puncta formation. Likewise, inhibition of endogenous miR-146a enhanced the DENV2-induced autophagic response. Combined with our earlier report that miR-146a plays an important role in enhancement of DENV replication in monocytes [37] , these data indicate that miR-146a is a crucial regulator of DENV infection. In addition, in mock-infected A549 cells, an obvious change in the amount of LC3-II was observed after miR-146a overexpression or inhibition, indicating that miR-146a contributes to the limitation of basal autophagic activity in A549 cells.",

Consistently, Fig. 8 Autophagy increases the expression of DENV2-induced proinflammatory cytokines. A549 cells were stimulated with rapamycin (Rapa) (2 \u03bcM, 12 h) (A, B) or transfected with beclin1 or ATG7 siRNA (C, D), followed by DENV2 infection at an MOI of 1 or mock infection. The cells were then harvested for RNA extraction, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 (A, C) and IL-6 (B, D). A549 cells were either transfected separately or co-transfected with an miR -146a mimic (10 nM) and a TRAF6 expression plasmid, and the cells were then infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1) or left uninfected. The expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 (E) and IL-6 (F) were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. A549 cells were either transfected separately or co-transfected with LNA-146a (50 nM) and a TRAF6 siRNA, followed by infection with DENV2 at an MOI of 1 or mock infection. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure the levels of TNF-\u03b1 (G) and IL-6 (H). A549 cells were stimulated with rapamycin (2 \u03bcM, 12 h) and then infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1) or left uninfected. IFN-\u03b2 expression was detected by quantitative RT-PCR (I). Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; NS, non-significant inhibition of autophagy using beclin 1 or ATG7 siRNA decreased DENV2-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production. These data suggest that autophagy modulates the DENV2induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response. The regulation role of autophagy on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production has been reported previously by several groups. Crisan et al. showed that treatment of both human and murine cells with 3-MA strongly inhibits TLR-dependent TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion [27] . Moreover, in M. tuberculosisinfected macrophages, treatment with 3-MA decreased transcription of TNF-\u03b1 but increased IL-6 transcription [48] . In these experiments, it is not yet clear whether this is a specific effect of autophagy or some other off-target or toxic effect of 3-MA. However, in our study, beclin 1 or ATG7 siRNA was used, which would help to clarify this. In addition, our data showed that miR-146a significantly regulated the expression of DENV2-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by targeting TRAF6, suggesting that the miR-146a-autophagy axis plays important roles in regulating the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in DENV infection. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play important roles in dengue disease development. However, not all of them can affect DENV replication. A previous study demonstrated that DENV replication is not strongly affected by either the addition of high levels of TNF-\u03b1 or the blocking of endogenous TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages [55] . A similar observation has been made for DENV-infected dendritic cells [56] . Furthermore, these studies found that DENVinfected cells do not respond normally to TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, suggesting a possible mechanism for subverting host antiviral responses by DENV.",

The results presented in this work can be summarized as follows: miR-146a negatively regulates the expression of TRAF6, resulting in inhibition of autophagic activity in DENV2-infected A549 cells and THP-1 cells. Therefore, an autophagy-related miRNA, miR-146a, has been found to inhibit DENVinduced autophagy by targeting TRAF6 and potentially suppressing excessive inflammation in host cells to lessen pathological damage of dengue infection.
