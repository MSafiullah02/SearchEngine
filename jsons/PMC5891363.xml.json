Human and animal coronaviruses are classified into at least 25 species in four genera, \u03b1 to \u03b4 coronaviruses [1]. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is the most prominently studied coronavirus both in vitro and in vivo, serving as the prototype coronavirus. Human coronaviruses, including 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 strains, have been implicated in respiratory infections, otitis media, exacerbations of asthma, diarrhea, myocarditis, and neurological disease [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. In contrast, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pose a significant threat to public health worldwide due to their ability to cause serious human disease with high mortality rates [[2], [3], [4]]. MERS-CoV has become a global threat due to continuous outbreaks in countries on the Arabian peninsula and the potential of spread to other countries with a high mortality rate [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Coronaviruses are also important pathogens in animals and are associated with respiratory and enteric illnesses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and bovine coronavirus [1]. There are currently no effective vaccines or small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of MERS (or SARS) coronavirus infection [[9], [10], [11]].",

            "text": "The highly conserved genome of coronaviruses contains two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, on the 5\u2032 end that encode nonstructural proteins. Genes encoding the coronavirus structural proteins, S (spike glycoprotein), E (envelope protein), M (membrane glycoprotein), and N (nucleocapsid protein), which play a critical role in virion-cell receptor binding, replication and virion assembly, are located at the 3\u2032 end of the genome [1,12]. Coronavirus entry is initiated by the binding of the spike protein (S) to cell receptors, specifically, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Entry into cells requires host proteases for cleavage at two sites in the S protein, in the case of most CoV [13,14] Translation of the genomic mRNA of ORF1a yields polyprotein pp1a, while a second polyprotein (pp1b) is the product of a ribosomal frame shift that joins ORF1a together with ORF1b. ORF1a encodes a papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro). Polyproteins pp1a and pp1b are processed by 3CLpro (11 cleavage sites) and PLpro (3 cleavage sites) resulting in sixteen mature nonstructural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, which play important roles in the transcription and replication of coronaviruses (Fig. 1\n). Both proteases are essential for viral replication, making them attractive targets for drug development [9,10,[15], [16], [17]].",

Specifically, administration of GC376 to cats infected with FIPV, a coronavirus that is 100% fatal in cats, reversed the progression of fatal FIP and resulted in clinical remission in a majority of animals (>90%). Since FIP disease progression is quite rapid and its pathogenesis primarily immune-mediated, features shared by MERS-CoV, we hypothesized that a viral protease inhibitor could reverse the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in affected hosts. Interrogation of this hypothesis entailed, as a first step, the design of a new and versatile class of peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL protease. We describe herein the structure-guided design of inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro that embody a piperidine moiety as a novel design element, as well as pertinent structural and biochemical studies. These inhibitors were also examined against other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, FIPV and MHV to evaluate the spectrum of activity against multiple coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The structure-guided design of inhibitor (I) encompassed the following steps: (a) we first determined a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of MERS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with GC376 (Fig. 2\n/Panel A). Examination of the active site of the complex revealed that the aldehyde bisulfite adduct had reverted to the precursor peptidyl aldehyde, which subsequently formed a tetrahedral hemi-thioacetal upon reaction with the active site Cys148. Notably, the electron density at this stereocenter was consistent with the formation of both R and S enantiomers at the covalent binding site (also observed for the other structures described in the following sections). The structure reveals a network of backbone hydrogen bonds which ensure correct positioning of the inhibitor to the active site, as well as two critical hydrogen bonds with the P1 Gln surrogate [26] side chain. The inhibitor P2 Leu side chain is ensconced in the hydrophobic S2 subsite of the enzyme. Importantly, the structure shows a hydrophobic-driven interaction between the benzyl group of the inhibitor and the \u03b3-lactam ring of the Gln surrogate side chain; (b) based on the forgoing, we reasoned that extending the \u201ccap\u201d would allow the inhibitor to assume an extended conformation and orient the phenyl ring toward the hydrophobic S4 pocket of the enzyme. Validation of this idea was obtained by synthesizing extended inhibitor GC813 and determining a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro:GC813 complex (Fig. 2/Panel B). The m-Cl phenethyl side chain is clearly shown to occupy the hydrophobic S4 subsite. In addition to an array of H-bonds with Gln192, Glu169, and Gln167 and the backbone of the inhibitor, which serve to correctly position the inhibitor at the active site, the inhibitor interacts with the S1, S2 and S4 subsites, but not the S3 subsite; (c) we hypothesized that the attachment of a piperidine ring to the peptidyl component would yield a structurally novel peptidomimetic (I) capable of (1) orienting recognition elements R3 and R4 in a correct vector relationship for optimal interactions with the S3 and S4 subsites, (2) rendering a dipeptidyl inhibitor equivalent to a tetrapeptidyl inhibitor with potentially diminished PK liabilities and, (3) providing a flexible means for the structure-guided parallel optimization of ADMET/PK and physicochemical properties using diversity sites R3 and R4 in inhibitor (I) (Fig. 3\n). In summary, the piperidine-based design strategy is a hitherto unrecognized effective means of rendering a dipeptidyl inhibitor equivalent to a tetrapeptidyl inhibitor capable of engaging in optimal binding interactions with all four S1-S4 subsites but which, however, is anticipated to display diminished PK liabilities due to its reduced peptidyl character. Furthermore, the aforementioned piperidine-based design strategy has wide applicability and can be extended to any protease with an extended binding site. Preliminary evidence in support of this approach is provided by the results of enzyme and cell-based screening of derivatives of (I) (Table 1, Table 2\n), as well as the results of structural studies (vide infra) (see Table 3).",

Subsequent coupling with glutamine surrogate methyl ester hydrochloride 11 afforded the desired dipeptidyl esters (6a, 6c and 6e) which were either treated with lithium borohydride directly or were first treated with dry HCl in dioxane followed by reaction with an alkyl sulfonyl chloride or alkyl chloroformate, to yield esters (7b, 7d and 7f) prior to reduction with lithium borohydride, to yield alcohols 8 (a-f).

The formation of a tetrahedral adduct via the reaction of the aldehyde, generated from aldehyde bisulfite adduct 10c under the crystallization conditions used [27,28], with the active site cysteine (Cys148) is clearly evident, confirming the mechanism of action of (I). Inspection of the structure reveals the presence of prominent electron density consistent with the structure of inhibitor 10c; however, the N-Boc-piperidinyl moiety was disordered. The position and orientation of the benzyl group suggest that the piperidine ring is likely projecting toward the S4 subsite. Inhibitor 10c is bound to the active site of the enzyme via a network of backbone H-bonds with Gln192, Gln167, and Glu169 (Fig. 5B). Additionally, a H-bond with His41 serves to stabilize the hemi-thioacetal tetrahedral adduct. Also clearly evident are three critical H-bonds involving the P1 Gln surrogate ring oxygen and nitrogen with Glu169, His166 and Phe143. The H-bonding interactions are near identical to those of inhibitor GC813 (Fig. 2/Panel B).

We disclose herein for the first time the design and utilization of a general class of piperidine-based peptidomimetic inhibitors of coronavirus 3CL proteases. Attachment of the piperidine moiety to a dipeptidyl component permits the resultant hybrid inhibitor to engage in favorable binding interactions with the S3 and S4 subsites of the enzyme. More importantly, the approach disclosed herein can be extended to other proteases of medical relevance. Finally, the disclosed compounds potently inhibit MERS-CoV, and their mechanism of action and mode of binding to MERS-CoV 3CL protease have been illuminated using X-ray crystallography.",

The expression and purification of the 3CLpro of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or FIPV was performed by a standard method described previously by our lab [24,29]. The protease (3CLpro of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or FIPV) was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound or with DMSO in 25 \u03bcL of assay buffer and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 25 \u03bcL of assay buffer containing substrate. Fluorescence readings were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800; Biotec, Winoosk, VT) 1 h following the addition of substrate. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were determined by subtracting background values (substrate-containing well without protease) from the raw fluorescence values, as described previously [29]. The dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with a variable slope by using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) in order to determine the IC50 values of the inhibitors.",
