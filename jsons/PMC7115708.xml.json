Cancer and HIV/AIDS have shown to parallel other traumatic stressors in many ways. The diagnosis may be sudden and unexpected, the disease and treatment may pose threats to one's life, and the experience may evoke intense emotional responses of fear and helplessness. At the same time living with a life-threatening illness is not an acute, singular stressful experience, but rather a series of unfolding threats and stressors (Cordova, 2008). Cumulatively, these experiences can constitute a traumatic stressor for many individuals with cancer or HIV/AIDS. Experiencing a life-threatening illness was first recognised as an event that could precipitate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Rates of PTSD in cancer patients range from 5% to 35% (Kangas, Henry, & Bryant, 2002) and in HIV/AIDS patients from 30% to 64% (Botha, 1996, Kelly et al., 1998, Martinez et al., 2002).",

Researchers have used a number of different terms to describe individuals' reports of benefits in the face of adversity, including posttraumatic growth, adversarial growth, benefit-finding, and thriving. Throughout this paper Tedeschi, Park, and Calhoun's (1998) term posttraumatic growth (PTG) will be used to describe a positive change in one's previous level of functioning as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances. This term differs from resilience, optimism, hardiness, which describe individuals who have adjusted successfully despite adversity (O'Leary & Ickovics, 1995), whereas individuals experiencing PTG are transformed by their struggle with adversity.",

            "text": "A rapidly increasing literature now testifies to the prevalence of positive life changes and personal growth following cancer and HIV/AIDS. Equally high rates of positive changes have been reported across both illnesses. Between 59% and 83% of people living with HIV/AIDS have been shown to report positive changes since diagnosis (*Milam, 2004, *Milam, 2006b, Siegel and Schrimshaw, 2000). Likewise, data suggest that between 60% and 90% of cancer survivors also report positive changes (Collins et al., 1990, Fromm et al., 1996, *Petrie et al., 1999, Rieker et al., 1985). Within the general PTG literature three common categories of growth outcomes have been identified (Joseph and Linley, 2006, Tedeschi et al., 1998). First, individuals often report that their relationships are enhanced in some way. For example many individuals with cancer or HIV/AIDS require practical and emotional support, and positive interpersonal experiences may strengthen a person's appreciation of some relationships. Second, people change their views of themselves in some way. For example patients may develop a greater sense of personal resilience and strength, an acceptance of their vulnerabilities and limitations, which are typified by a heightened awareness of their own mortality and the fragility of life. Third, there are often reports of changes in life philosophy. For example people diagnosed with cancer or HIV/AIDS are faced with the concern that their disease might progress and shorten their life and these concerns may lead to a shift in priorities and values, and to a different appreciation and approach to day-to-day life. Together these positive changes in psychological well-being can lead to a whole new way of living. Finally certain changes have been identified specific to individuals facing a serious illness. A recent focus of the PTG research has been the relationship between PTG and health behaviours (*Milam, 2004, Milam et al., 2004). Luszczynska, Sarkar and Knoll (2007) found that PTG significantly predicted adherence to antiretroviral therapy in individuals diagnosed with HIV. Furthermore, women with breast cancer have described making positive changes in health related behaviours and engaging in more careful cancer surveillance as a result of their experience (Sears, Stanton, & Danoff-Burg, 2003). Studies that compare PTG in cancer and HIV/AIDS patients suggest that growth is experienced in the same multidimensional manner across both illnesses (Lechner & Weaver, 2009). Therefore, alongside psychological, interpersonal, and life orientation changes, positive changes in health behaviours may also occur following a life-threatening illness diagnosis.",

Although with some variation, most models hypothesize that the experience of a highly stressful or traumatic event violates an individual's basic beliefs about the self and the world and that some type of meaning making or cognitive processing to rebuild these beliefs and goals occurs, resulting in perceptions that one has grown through the process (Horowitz, 1986, Janoff-Bulman, 2004, Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). Although offering different levels of explanation at both the social cognitive and biological evolutionary levels, they are complimentary in that they are underpinned by the notion that people are intrinsically motivated towards growth (Joseph & Linley, 2006).",

For example Barakat, Alderfer, and Kazak (2006) found that PTG and posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively correlated in adolescent survivors of cancer.

Given the discrepant findings on this relationship a systematic integration of the literature is needed, and a meta-analysis is an ideal tool to do this. A previous meta-analysis conducted by Helgeson, Reynolds, and Tomich (2006) investigated the association between PTG and adjustment after a wide range of events such as sexual assault, natural disaster, bereavement, childhood abuse and illness. They found that PTG was related to more positive affect and less depression, but also to more intrusive thoughts about the event. PTG was unrelated to anxiety, distress, quality of life and subjective physical health. As such the aim of the current paper is to present a meta-analysis of the existing literature that will aim to objectively summarize PTG and its relation to adjustment in individuals living with a life threatening illness (cancer or HIV/AIDS) and to examine potential moderators of this relationship.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the inconsistency between PTG and adjustment is that the relationship is moderated by other variables. Therefore five possible moderators will be examined that might attenuate or accentuate the growth\u2013adjustment relationship. These were chosen because they are commonly assessed within the literature, and have prior empirical and theoretical foundations. The first variable that might moderate the relationship between PTG and adjustment is the length of time since the diagnosis. Research and theory suggest that PTG is unlikely to occur shortly after the critical event, but rather takes time to occur and is more likely to be reported in hindsight (Joseph and Linley, 2005, Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1995, Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). Therefore it is hypothesized that PTG is associated with positive adjustment when a longer time since the health event has elapsed. Three characteristics of the sample will also be examined as moderators: age, gender, and ethnicity. Past research has indicated that women (Bellizzi, 2004, *Milam, 2004), younger participants (Kinsinger et al., 2006; Linley and Joseph, 2004, *Milam, 2004, *Widows et al., 2005), and ethnic minorities are more likely to report PTG. However, it is not clear if and how these individual differences differentially relate to PTG and adjustment (Helgeson et al., 2006). Therefore no specific predictions about directionality regarding how these variables might moderate the growth\u2013adjustment relationship will be made. It is also possible that the quality of the study might moderate the relationship between growth and health. For example studies that use a valid measure of growth should reflect actual PTG, and distinguish from other processes such as self-enhancement, positive illusion, and \u201cpseudo-growth\u201d (Lechner & Antoni, 2004; Park & Lechner, 2006). Less validated measures may fail to capture PTG, and therefore account for some of the variation in the research. Through examination of these moderators it is hoped that the meta-analysis will identify subgroups of adults whose experience of PTG is likely to be positively or negatively related to mental and physical health.",

Relevant key words were used to search for articles within these databases. Search terms included key words related to PTG: posttraumatic growth, post-traumatic growth, benefit finding, stress related growth and adversarial growth. These terms were crossed with the following health-related key terms: health, illness, disease, life-threatening, chronic, medical, terminal, cancer, HIV, AIDS. Additional studies were located through the inspection of the reference sections of obtained papers and reviews. Relevant journals were also manually searched to locate papers that may not have been identified in the databases. These journals were: Psycho-Oncology, Psychology and Health, Journal of Traumatic Stress, British Journal of Health Psychology and Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. In addition, active researchers in the field of psychological growth in health samples were contacted to ask for recent papers in the field and for unpublished research to reduce the effect of publication bias. A search of abstracts from relevant conferences was also conducted to locate additional unpublished work in the area. However, no unpublished studies were retrieved.

First, studies were included only if the sample were adults aged 18 or over. This decision was made because the current literature is unclear whether children or adolescents differentially experience PTG in comparison to adults (Ickovics et al., 2006a, *Ickovics et al., 2006b, Milam et al., 2004), and also only a small number of studies have explored PTG in children and adolescents following illness (too few to include adult vs. child as a moderator variable). This resulted in the exclusion of nine studies. Second, the studies had to use a quantitative measure of PTG, which was assessed in relation to a measure of positive psychological adjustment, negative psychological adjustment or physical health. Studies that included a purely qualitative assessment of PTG, or papers that were reviews of the literature were excluded from the analysis. This resulted in the exclusion of 87 studies. Third, PTG must be measured in cancer or HIV/AIDS patients. This criterion resulted in the exclusion of 16 studies. Fourth, intervention studies were excluded from the analysis unless they measured PTG at baseline prior to manipulation and effect sizes could be extracted. This resulted in the exclusion of 20 studies. Fifth, controlled comparison studies that did not report relevant data for the patient sample were excluded. This resulted in the exclusion of nine studies. Longitudinal studies which measured PTG at different time points to adjustment measures were excluded. However, when longitudinal studies reported cross-sectional relationships these were included in the analysis. This resulted in the exclusion of seven studies. Studies needed to include the relevant effect sizes (namely the correlation coefficient r) or sufficient statistical information that could be used to compute this statistic. Authors of papers with unclear statistical information were contacted to enquire about further information and if this was unable to be provided these papers were excluded from the analysis.1\nOnly two papers were excluded as a result of this criterion. Finally, the authors of five non-English articles were contacted for copies of their papers but these were not provided. Fig. 1\nsummarizes the results of the systematic search.",

Therefore to guarantee the independence assumption among effect sizes the coefficients were averaged to produce a single effect size associated with overall PTG. When a study did not report the effect size or probability value but stated only the relationship was nonsignificant an effect size of zero was assigned to that relationship. This is a conservative strategy because it generally underestimates the true magnitude of effect sizes (Durlak and Lipsey, 1991, Rosenthal, 1995). However, this approach is preferable to excluding nonsignificant results from the meta-analysis, because this would result in an overestimation of combined effect sizes (Rosenthal, 1995). The authors of these papers were contacted for further information and there was only one study where an effect size of zero assumed.2\nIn meta-analysis two common statistical procedures are used: fixed- and random-effect models (Hedges, 1992, Hedges and Vevea, 1998, Hunter and Schmidt, 2000, Hunter and Schmidt, 2000). Real social science data have been shown to contain variability in effect sizes as the norm, which indicates variable population parameters (Field, 2003, Field, 2005, Field and Gillet, in press, Hunter and Schmidt, 2000, Hunter and Schmidt, 2000). For this reason, and so the results can be generalized beyond the studies included in the meta-analysis, a random effects model was carried out. Hedges and Vevea's (1998) method was applied using Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients with results reported after the back transformation to the Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient (see Field, 2005, Overton, 1998). Using this method, each effect size is weighted by a value reflecting both the within study variance (1/n\n \u2212 3 for correlation coefficients in which n is the sample size) and the between study variance (\u03c4\n2). The exact weight function for each effect size is wi*=1ni\u22123+\u03c4\u02c62\u22121 (see Field & Gillet, in press for a guide to using Hedges and Vevea's method).",

            "text": "In any meta-analysis publication bias is a concern. This bias refers to the tendency that the decision to publish a paper is determined by the results of the study (Begg, 1994). For example studies with nonsignificant findings are less likely to be published than those with significant outcomes, which could result in a positive bias within the literature. There are different approaches to estimating publication bias: Rosenthal's (1979) fail-safe N, funnel plots and sensitivity analysis. The fail safe N estimates the number of unpublished, nonsignificant studies that would have to exist for the obtained probability value of the population effect size estimate to be rendered nonsignificant. This measure is problematic because its emphasis is on significance testing the population effect size rather than estimating the population effect size itself. Therefore, we have chosen to report measures that specifically address bias in the population effect size estimate. First, we produce funnel plots of the effect found in each study against the standard error (Light & Pillemer, 1984). An unbiased sample will show a cloud of data points that is symmetric around the population effect size and has the shape of a funnel (reflecting greater variability in effect sizes from studies with small sample sizes/less precision). Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis, which is a method that uses weights to model the process through which the likelihood of a study being published varies (usually based on a criterion such as the significance of a study). We applied the methods proposed by Vevea and Woods (2005) because they can be applied to relatively small samples of studies such as we have.",

PTG was significantly related to higher levels of positive psychological adjustment (PTG explained 1.7% of the variance), lower levels of negative psychological adjustment (PTG explained only 0.3% of the variance), and higher reported levels of physical health (PTG explained 1.4% of the variance). The results suggest considerable variation in effect sizes for the three adjustment outcomes, and it is therefore important to examine factors that moderate these relationships. The funnel plots shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\nsuggest publication bias might be present in the data, as indicated by the non-funnel like and asymmetric distribution of data points around the estimated mean, typical of biased data sets. In particular, for positive mental health (Fig. 1) and physical health (Fig. 3), the data cloud is relatively sparse for small studies (the bottom part of the figure). This pattern is indicative of one-tailed publication bias (Vevea & Woods, 2005). For negative mental health (Fig. 2) the cloud is a little sparse around zero for small studies, which indicates two-tailed publication bias (Vevea & Woods, 2005). We calculated several publication-bias corrected estimates based on our interpretation of the funnel plots of the overall population effect sizes on positive mental health, negative mental health and physical health. We used Vevea and Woods' (2005) weight function model of publication bias to calculate population effect size estimates under different selection bias scenarios. Based on the funnel plots, for positive mental health and physical health we assumed moderate (MOT) or severe (SOT) one-tailed selection bias, and for negative mental health we assumed moderate (MTT) and severe (STT) two-tailed selection bias. The values corrected for selection bias were as follows: for positive mental adjustment, the original population estimate of .13 was reduced to .08 (MOT), \u2212.40 (SOT); for negative mental adjustment, the original estimate of \u2212.05 became \u2212.05 (MTT) and \u2212.04 (STT); for physical health the original estimate of .12 became .06 (MOT), \u2212.47 (SOT). As such, the estimate of population effect size for negative mental health was unaffected by publication bias. If we assume moderate publication bias, then estimates for positive mental health and physical health were slightly reduced, but if severe publication bias is assumed then the estimates change quite dramatically. As such, our conclusions come with the caveat that if severe publication bias was, in reality, present in the literature then our conclusions would be quite different for positive mental health and physical health outcomes.",

These results are consistent with the results from a previous meta-analysis looking at PTG following a range of traumas (Helgeson et al., 2006). Together these findings suggest that in the short-term PTG is influential in reducing negative symptoms, but in the long-term PTG is more instrumental in enhancing positive well-being. This is consistent with Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1995, Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004 functional-descriptive model of PTG, which states that the management of emotional distress is essential in the initial stages post-trauma. On the other hand, PTG reported later might reflect more substantive life changes that have positive consequences for quality of life (Tomich & Helgeson, 2004).

Younger adults demonstrated a stronger positive relationship between PTG and positive mental health.

One explanation is that core beliefs of young people may be more affected than those of older people. For example younger people tend to view the world as less just and less benevolent, and the older groups tend to view the world as luckier and more controllable (Calhoun, Cann, Tedeschi, & McMillan, 1998). Being diagnosed with cancer or HIV/AIDS when young might shatter more natural and social rules or beliefs which would generate a greater possibility of reconstructing these core beliefs and therefore promote PTG. Another explanation might be that younger people may be more capable and adept at making changes to their lives, which results in enhanced well-being. Whereas, older participants may be dealing with other significant life events and be less adaptable compared with younger samples, and therefore PTG may be more useful in reducing and managing distress.

For example it is not clear if PTG leads to better psychological and physical health, or if these factors result in an enhanced perception of PTG. Furthermore, even though studies were included in the analysis only if they used a clear measure of PTG the final data set consisted of studies that used varying conceptions of PTG, which could be problematic. For example, past research has indicated that benefit finding and PTG are related but distinct constructs, and might therefore have unique predictors and outcomes (Sears et al., 2003). Therefore, future research in the area should ascertain if such constructs are theoretically and empirically interchangeable.",

Although research suggests that people with HIV/AIDS report similar levels and areas of PTG compared to individuals with cancer, there are unique differences between the illnesses, particularly in social responses to individuals with HIV/AIDS compared to those with cancer (Lechner & Weaver, 2009). For example HIV/AIDS is an infectious disease and people who are HIV positive may face more stigma because of fear, lack of knowledge concerning transmission, and greater perceived accountability (Lechner & Weaver, 2009).

Second, as with many meta-analytic studies, the current findings may over represent those studies that are published and have significant results, preventing the generalization of the current findings to unpublished reports (Rosenthal, 1979). For the overall effects, our publication bias analysis showed that the population effect size estimates were relatively unaffected when corrected for moderate selection bias. This finding gives us some confidence that the results are not idiosyncratic to our sample of studies. However, when correcting for severe publication bias the effect of growth on positive mental adjustment and physical health became strongly negative (the opposite direction to the population effects).

The findings from this study suggest that shortly after the event PTG may be used as a coping strategy to manage and reduce emotional distress associated with the illness threat. However over time PTG grows and is more significant in enhancing positive well-being. This implies that adjustment to serious illness is an ongoing process that occurs over time (Helgeson et al., 2006, Bellizzi, 2004).

Traumatic events are thought to shatter assumptions about the self and the world and lead to the symptoms of PTSD. These experiences of reexperiencing, avoidance and arousal are viewed as the cognitive emotional processing of the new trauma related information as individuals search for new meaning in life (Joseph & Linley, 2008). As these new meanings are found, and the person's view of themselves and the world is reconstructed, PTG should occur and symptoms of distress should decrease. Therefore PTG should be predictive of lower distress, because as people find new meaning they can overcome the cognitive disruption and confusion characterized by PTSD (Joseph & Linley, 2005). Support for this has been reported by Frazier, Conlon and Glaser (2001) who found that among sexual assault survivors who reported PTG over 12 months were the least distressed.",

Psychotherapy for traumatic events such as a serious illness has predominantly focused on the negative effects of trauma, and the goal of therapeutic intervention to promote growth as opposed to alleviate distress will be a major paradigm shift. It is therefore important to raise clinician's awareness of the possibility of positive change. For example, clinicians might recognize the patient's struggle to understand the impact of the illness not only as a posttraumatic response but also as a potential precursor to growth (Zoellner & Maercker, 2006).",

Nonetheless some interventions, which contain techniques aimed at promoting growth, have shown to successfully improve outcomes. For example Antoni et al. (2001) found that a psychosocial intervention that taught participants broad cognitive behavioural stress management techniques, served to increase reports of perceived benefits from having had breast cancer, and simultaneously reduced levels of depression. This study demonstrates that PTG can be altered and can be incorporated easily within cognitive behavioural stress-management interventions. However, the findings from the meta-analysis suggest that clinicians should be sensitive to the timing of PTG discussions. For example the present analysis suggests that PTG might be a useful target in the short-term to reduce distress, but in order to enhance well-being PTG should be targeted later on in the adjustment process.",

Care should also be taken to avoid imposing an expectation of PTG in the face of serious illness. Patients with cancer or HIV/AIDS often report feeling burdened with the pressure to stay positive and encouraging the identification of positive changes from their illness may be potentially offensive to patients, serve to minimise their experience and lead them to suppress reports of distress (Bellizzi and Blank, 2006, Cordova, 2008).",

However, the review also indicates much remains to be learned and highlights areas of research where future work is needed. The present study indicates that in the short term, PTG is associated with a reduction in negative mental health, whereas over longer term, PTG is associated with an enhancement in positive well-being. Therefore a clear point of focus is the use of longitudinal studies to further disentangle and clarify the temporal course of this relationship. Experimental designs, such as the interventions described earlier, will also help to reveal the causal role of PTG in adjustment and to isolate mechanisms responsible for the effects (Algoe & Stanton, 2009).",

Moreover, to further explicate the growth\u2013adjustment relationship studies should continue to identify additional mediators and moderators. A particularly relevant moderator to medical populations that should be investigated is the perception of the severity of an illness. A previous meta-analysis found that perceptions of the severity of a traumatic event are related to PTG (Helgeson et al., 2006). As such it might be expected that PTG may have a stronger relationship with psychological well-being and physical health for more subjectively severe illnesses and caution must therefore be taken when generalizing the current findings to less threatening illnesses characteristics and indeed wider trauma populations.",

Furthermore, a recent prospective study of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Cheng, Wong, & Tsang, 2006) found that positive associations between PTG and positive well-being are more likely to be found among individuals who perceive benefits from the event, as well as the costs.

Although this paper only looked at subjective measures of physical health there is promising preliminary data which suggests that PTG may be related to better physiological functioning. For example Cruess et al. (2000) found that among women with breast cancer, cognitive behavioural stress management reduced levels of cortisol through the enhancement of PTG. Yet, no studies have addressed possible mechanisms for the relationship between PTG and physical health. A recent model proposed by Bower, Low, Moskowitz, Sepah, and Epel (2008) suggests that factors often associated with growth such as coping, positive affect and improved relationships, can lead to a state of enhanced allostasis (maintaining stability, or homeostasis, through change, Sterling & Eyer, 1988), which buffers against future stress responses. This is a promising model, which merits increased attention in future research. Furthermore, the relationship between PTG and health behaviours such as exercise, medication adherence, requires a more detailed examination; particularly regarding how these behaviours might moderate the relationship between PTG and physical health.",
