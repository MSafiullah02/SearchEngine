All of Earth's surface and subsurface waters have likely been in contact with microbes or their by-products since at least 3.5 Ga, when the first widely accepted traces of life appear in the geological record (cf., Schopf et al., 2018 and references therein). That traces of life are preserved within very ancient remnants of the crust indicates that perhaps life had already colonized the entire planet. Accordingly, over the eons during which water-rich Earth has been teeming with life, it is difficult to determine how an \u201cuninhabited habitable planet\u201d would appear when sampled directly or observed remotely.",

            "text": "A biosignature is an object, substance, and/or pattern whose origin specifically requires a biological agent (Des Marais et al., 2008). The usefulness of a biosignature is determined not only by the probability that life produced it, but also by the improbability that nonbiological processes produced it. Biosignatures can be any observable phenomena such as elemental abundances, molecules, objects, isotopic abundance patterns, or processes that provide evidence of past or present life. Biosignatures include heteroatoms in graphitic carbon or isotopic patterns between reduced carbon and carbonates in ancient rocks (e.g., Bernard and Papineau, 2014), molecular biomarkers or their fragments (Summons et al., 2008; Jolley and Douglas, 2012), fossil-like cellular structures (e.g., Schopf and Kudryavtsev, 2012), possible biogenic structures in diagenetic concretions, granules, and rosettes (Berner, 1968; Coleman, 1993; Papineau et al., 2016, 2017), and microbially influenced structures such as stromatolite-like morphologies (e.g., Grotzinger and Knoll, 1999; Berelson et al., 2011; Pepe-Ranney et al., 2012) and Microbially Induced Sedimentary Structures (abbreviated as \u2018MISS,\u2019 Noffke et al., 1996). It is important to note that biosignatures typically include some objective measure or indicator of normal biological processes (e.g., pathogenesis or photosynthesis) (Mata et al., 2012), and these factors can be difficult to define, let alone measure (Cady et al., 2003). One example of this challenge is identifying particular biological processes associated with potential global-scale biosignatures in exoplanets (Des Marais et al., 2002).",

Extraterrestrial exploration for life is extremely challenging due to the technical demands of making remote measurements in the Solar System and beyond.

Science is presently unable to explain satisfactorily how terrestrial life originated, namely, whether early life and extraterrestrial life were or are compositionally or functionally similar with modern terrestrial life and had the same effects on the environment as modern life that we can observe directly. Biological evolution is undoubtedly influenced and constrained by larger scale planetary and Solar System processes, some of which are beyond biology's influence, such as tectonics (Lindsay and Brasier, 2002), solar activity (Ribas et al., 2005), and impacts (Kring, 2000). Yet, in other large-scale processes, such as the terrestrial nitrogen cycle (St\u00fceken et al., 2016; Laneuville et al., 2018), biology may have become a major factor very early on. As an example of the intertwining of planetary and biological processes, it is widely assumed that the buildup of molecular oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere is due to biology (Des Marais et al., 2002). However, the pacing of the rise of oxygen depended on parameters inherent in Earth's formation, for example, its size and elemental composition, which were inherited from stochastic processes during formation of the Solar System.",

There was then a development from single-celled bacteria, archaea, and eucarya, to multicellular organisms. As a result of this progression, biochemical complexity has also evolved over time according to various metrics (Woese, 1998; B\u00f6ttcher, 2018), with certain metabolic capabilities arising sequentially (e.g., oxygenic photosynthesis or oxidative metabolism). It further seems logical that, however, life began, it started in a \u201csimpler\u201d state that included less compositional, morphological, and functional capabilities (Woese, 1998).

Abiotic chemistry must be understood sufficiently in detail such that when a signal is observed, there is a reasonable certainty as to whether it is biotically or abiotically produced versus being a terrestrial contaminant (Fox and Strasdeit, 2017). Extensive work in abiotic chemistry shows that a variety of biochemicals can be generated by abiological processes, for example, through atmospheric (Miller, 1953), hydrothermal (Hennet et al., 1992; Amend and Shock, 1998), or interstellar chemistry (Bernstein et al., 2005). These studies caution that many seemingly complex or uniquely biogenic compounds may be at best ambiguous biosignatures and they could be called dubio-biosignatures (e.g., Cady et al., 2003). Indeed, environmental chemistry that generates organic complexity is widely viewed as being a stage in the emergence of life (Cleaves, 2012), and thus, it is possible that such compounds could be markers of transitional stages in biogenesis, although not of life per se.",

As N is recycled in ecosystems, life greatly augments the amount of N2 drawn down from the atmosphere and alters the way that fixed higher and lower oxidation state N-species can be passed into the mantle by subduction (Zerkle and Mikhail, 2017; Laneuville et al., 2018).",

Most of these studies, which are based on field observations and validated by laboratory experiments, explore the role of microbes in mineral formation.

            "text": "Peptides are another major class of biopolymer present in all extant life on Earth. These are polymers of a limited set of 20 common amino acids, and importantly, in terrestrial life, amino acids are exclusively l-enantiomers (except glycine, which is achiral). How life evolved to use specifically this set of amino acids or enantiomers is unknown (Blackmond, 2010; Ilardo et al., 2015). Although extant life only uses 20 proteinogenic amino acids, many of which have been found in extraterrestrial samples (Kvenvolden et al., 1970), extraterrestrial examples of proteinogenic amino acids occur alongside many other types of nonproteinogenic amino acids (Cronin and Pizzarello, 1997; Ambrogelly et al., 2007). Nonproteinogenic amino acids are, by definition, not found in proteins although some are found in natural products (Walsh et al., 2013). The observation of proteinogenic amino acids by itself does not constitute a biosignature, as abiotic processes can also form these molecules (Miller, 1953; Mullen and Sutherland, 2007; Aubrey et al., 2009; Higgs and Pudritz, 2009), and even peptides are not necessarily biosignatures, as they can also be formed abiotically (Leman et al., 2004; Danger et al., 2012; Kitadai et al., 2017). However, the exclusive detection of extraterrestrial homochiral peptides of significant length is not probabilistically favorable and may be an unambiguous biosignature (Orgel, 1998). This raises questions of whether homochiral peptides might be produced abiotically from a racemic pool of abiotically produced amino acids (Mathew et al., 2004; C\u00f3rdova et al., 2005; Meierhenrich et al., 2005).",

Uraninite (UO2) is an interesting mineral example whose morphology appears to have changed through deep time as a consequence of biology (Hazen et al., 2009). In Archean rocks before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), uraninite is typically coarse grained, occurring abiotically in both igneous formations and as stream-eroded grains in sediments (Rasmussen and Buick, 1999). However, more recent formations display concentrations of nanouraninite by strains of Geobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Shewanella, which may couple acetate oxidation to the reduction of aqueous uranyl cations, UO22+ to nanouraninite (Lovely et al., 1991; Spear et al., 2000; Fayek et al., 2005; Long, 2008; Sharp et al., 2008). Although nanouraninite is still ambiguous as a biosignature, the role of microbes in modifying mineral morphology represents an important opportunity in future biomarker research.",

Microbes rapidly degrade H2O2 and superoxide (Wilson et al., 2000), limiting the maximum concentration achievable in surface waters. In the absence of microbes, it is possible that H2O2, and superoxide concentrations (in the presence of O2) would continue to increase until the rate of the degradation equals the rate of formation, which could lead to very high concentrations of environmental H2O2 and superoxide. Thus, high photochemically achievable concentrations of ROS could mean that there is no life, while lower but constant maxima could mean that life is present. Such a subtle distinction would require a highly nuanced interpretation. For example, Meadows et al. (2018) compare abiotic mechanisms of O2 production on exoplanets with the early emergence of photosynthesis as a source of O2 on Earth. The environmental conditions comprising planetary atmospheres and stellar spectra, under several models of such conditions, could produce biosignature false positives.",

They point out, though, that photochemical processes, among others, must be considered, particularly with respect to photodissociation of methane. The abiotic, and potentially biotic, rates of the formation and degradation reactions are key for allowing the concentrations of either carbon dioxide or methane to build up.

Some macroscale features represent the collective physical remains of structured microbial communities (Awramik, 1992), where diagnostic wavy laminar, domical, clotted, conical, branching, and stratiform morphologies would not form in such finely laminated deposit were it not for the microbial influences. Indeed, in Archean rocks, the macrostructures associated with microstructures (e.g., stromatolitic lamination and MISS) can be extensive and compelling as a morphological biosignature (Noffke et al., 2008; Noffke and Awramik, 2013). Stromatolites and certain types of microbial mats are further discussed in a later section on patterns.",

However, physicochemical changes to sedimentary deposits over geologic time can also result in the formation of similar abiotic textures in ancient rocks (e.g., Grosch and McLoughlin, 2015; Davies et al., 2016). For example, mudcracks can resemble burrows in a cross-sectional view, or clotted paleosol development can resemble burrow textures. Larger organisms and collections of organisms (biofilms, microbial mats) may be preserved but may be significantly reduced in size due to compaction during diagenesis (Bower et al., 2017) and dewatering. Consistency in parameters such as texture, size, and orientation can be useful in differentiating biotic from abiotic signals but examining these features at a variety of scales is still necessary to deduce biogenicity in ancient rocks.",

There are also a variety of regular banding patterns observable in many mineral types, for example, the banding observed in minerals such as malachite [Cu2CO3(OH)2].

In these pathways, CO2 containing the lighter isotope of carbon, 12C, is energetically more easily manipulated than CO2 containing 13C, resulting in enrichment in 12C in the resulting fixed organic carbon. The utility of stable isotope fractionation patterns as a biosignature depends on the isotopic composition of both the putative biological material and its starting material. However, some abiotic chemical processes produce isotopic fractionations similar with biological ones and biogenicity is often hotly debated on both sides, for example, see the disagreement over interpretation of iron isotopes in the ancient rock record in Guildbaud et al.

Alternatively, the presence of complex organic compounds and metabolic products might suggest biological element cycling with isotopic fractionation. Patterns of isotopic abundances, among individual types or classes of biomolecules, can be very compelling as biosignatures (e.g., Hayes, 2001).",

The stippled area shows reactions that occur in the absence of oxygen. Dots by chemical compounds indicate an unpaired electron, that is, free radicals. Image N.W.H.",
