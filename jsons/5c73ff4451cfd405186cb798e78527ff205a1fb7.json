Since their discovery, many efforts have been made to explore them as tools for silencing of viral genes and inhibition of viral growth [1] . Generally, there are two modes of application and delivery of catalytic RNAs to the cell. The first is a gene therapy approach, in which a gene encoding the ribozyme is cloned into a vector [2] . After transfection or transduction, the gene becomes stably integrated in the host DNA, and its transcription provides a continuous intracellular supply of the ribozyme. This approach has been used to deliver various types of catalytic RNAs, such as hammerhead, hairpin or M1 RNA of RNase P [2,3]. In the second method, synthetic ribozymes are added to cells from the outside. Efficient cleavage of the cellular target requires the presence of divalent metal ions, in particular Mg 2+ , which is virtually the only divalent metal ion available at millimolar con-centrations under normal intracellular conditions [4] . As RNA is chemically unstable and undergoes spontaneous degradation at neutral pH [5] the ribozyme elements that are not crucial for catalytic activity (e.g. recognition sequences) are often modified to increase stability [6] [7] [8] .",

The synthetic 16-mer RNA was applied with nontoxic, catalytic amount of lead to infected tobacco leaves. We observed inhibition of tobacco mosaic virus infection in tobacco leaves in vivo due to specific tobacco mosaic virus RNA cleavage effected by leadzyme. A significant reduction in tobacco mosaic virus accumulation was observed even when the leadzyme was applied up to 2 h after inoculation of leaves with tobacco mosaic virus. This process, called leadzyme interference, is determined by specific recognition and cleavage of the target site by the RNA catalytic strand in the presence of Pb 2+ .",

The catalytic RNA strand of the leadzyme and Pb 2+ were directly delivered (mechanical inoculation) together with TMV to Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanti-nc, a hypersensitive local lesion host. To evaluate the optimal Pb 2+ \u2044 RNA ratio for efficient TMV inhibition, Nicotiana tabacum leaves were inoculated with mixtures composed of TMV, catalytic RNA and Pb 2+ prepared just before inoculation. TMV genomic RNA is enclosed within the protein capsid, and as a result, leadzyme formation and TMV RNA cleavage is possible only within host cells. RNA was applied at four concentrations of 2.5, 5, 12 and 25 lm combined with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 lm Pb 2+ . At 4-5 days postinoculation, the amount of symptoms of infection manifested as local lesions was compared to that in control plants, i.e. inoculated with TMV alone or with TMV in the presence of RNA or Pb 2+ at the same concentrations as indicated above. Control assays, with 16-nucleotide catalytic RNA only or Pb 2+ applied in the presence of TMV, were performed to demonstrate the specificity of leadzyme cleavage. For each single assay, at least three plants were inoculated with the same mixtures, for both control and experimental assays. The number of local lesions was the basis for rejecting RNA and Pb 2+ concentrations at which disease symptoms were observed to a similar extent as in controls. In further experiments, 2.5 lm catalytic RNA with 1, 5 and 10 lm Pb 2+ were tested. This corresponds to 0.4, 2 and 4 Pb 2+ \u2044 RNA, respectively ( Fig. 3A ,B). Coinoculation of TMV and 2.5 lm RNA with 1, 5 and 10 lm Pb 2+ led to a decreased number of a local lesions ( 15) in comparison with control plants ( 80) (Fig. 3A,B) . The results of quantitative local lesion assays were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. They showed a lower level of TMV after treatment with a two-fold excess of Pb 2+ over catalytic RNA (Fig. 3C, lane 3) , whereas in control leaves infected with virus alone, TMV was detectable (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2) .",

RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from inoculated leaves confirmed those observations. Decreased TMV RNA expression was observed in leaves treated with RNA and Pb 2+ , whereas virus expression in control plants was at a high level (Fig. 5A) .

The therapeutic development of catalytic RNAs has faced many problems concerning stability, activity and delivery of RNA into the cells in vivo [1, 28, 30] . In the last few years, much attention has been paid to RNA interference (RNAi), a dsRNA-guided post-transcriptional gene-regulatory silencing mechanism that exists in virtually all eukaryotes. This evolutionarily conserved process is involved in defense against transposones and viruses [31] [32] [33] . However, there are some problems with inhibition of viral infections with RNAi. To escape RNAi-mediated inhibition, viruses evolved a defense strategy to overcome RNA silencing [34] . Many RNAi suppressors have been identified in plant, animal and insect viruses [34] . The best characterized are potyvirus-encoded helper component proteinase HcPro [49, 50] , cytomegalovirus-encoded 2b protein [49] and p25 protein identified in potato virus X [51] . An RNAi suppressor has also been found among members of the Tobamovirus genus (including TMV and tomato mosaic virus) [34, 52] . Suppressors are commonly involved in the enhancement of viral pathogenicity and accumulation of the viruses. It has been shown that these factors act at different steps in the RNAi pathway, e.g. prevention of siRNA production, siRNA binding or spread of the silencing signal [34, 52] . Another important but undesirable aspect of the RNAi process is induction of nonspecific effects by siRNAs. At the mRNA level, this is connected with an 'off-target effect' ) nonspecific degradation of transcripts. At the protein level, dsRNA delivery can activate RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2\u00a25\u00a2-oligoadenylate synthetase, the interferon response that leads to the cell death [35, 36] . To avoid these negative RNAi effects, we developed a new, efficient approach. It is based on the formation of the leadzyme motif in trans and hydrolysis of target RNA.",

This model system has several advantages. TMV is a highly infectious (+)ssRNA virus. The symptoms of infection can be easily evaluated (local lesions are countable) and observed in a short time period (4-5 days). In the TMV genome, we identified the specific cleavage target for a leadzyme. Two conserved CGAGC sequences were found in TMV genomes. The target sequence near the 5\u00a2-end located within ORF 1 encoding viral replicase was further analyzed. We designed and synthesized a catalytic 16-nucleotide RNA strand capable of forming a leadzyme with TMV RNA. It consists of a five-nucleotide asymmetric loop surrounded by two dsRNA regions (Fig. 1C) . The leadzyme with the internal loop composed of five nucleotides shows a higher rate of hydrolysis (k obs \u00bc 1.4 \u00b7 10 )1 min )1 ) when compared to the 'classic' leadzyme with a six-nucleotide internal loop (k obs \u00bc 0.70 \u00b7 10 )1 min )1 ) (Fig. 1A ) [15] . High activity of the leadzyme with an asymmetric internal loop with five nucleotides was confirmed by structural analysis of mammalian 5S rRNA [16] . The designed leadzyme showed Pb 2+ -binding capacity and hydrolytic properties (Fig. 2) . A 10-fold excess of Pb 2+ over RNA (leadzyme catalytic strand) was used. A main 37-nucleotide cleavage product was observed. We also observed some nonspecific degradation products, which are probably due to the chemical lability of Py-Pu phosphodiester bonds and the lack of higherorder structure in short RNAs [37, 38] .",

We assume that inhibition of TMV growth in leaves was due to specific cleavage of TMV RNA (at positions 426 and 427 of TMV RNA). This was manifested by the decreased number of local lesions on infected tobacco leaves treated with catalytic RNA and Pb 2+ . We found 15-35 local lesions in examined assays vs. 80-110 in controls. Reliable proof of TMV RNA hydrolysis came from the RT-PCR experiments. A high rate of infection observed in reference plants treated with only RNA or Pb 2+ indicates that neither RNA nor Pb 2+ alone can account for TMV RNA hydrolysis. The control experiments with tobacco leaves dosed with catalytic RNA and TMV showed high rates of infection (on both the phenotypic and molecular levels), and demonstrated that the exogenous RNA used in this study performs its catalytic function only in the presence of Pb 2+ . Therefore, the catalytic RNA alone can serve as a noncatalytic negative control. The optimal activity of the leadzyme in vivo was observed during TMV \u2044 Pb 2+ \u2044 RNA coinoculation and with a two-fold Pb 2+ excess over the catalytic RNA. This conclusion is consistent with crystallographic data on the leadzyme structure obtained at 1.8 \u00c5 . The crystal structure shows two Pb 2+ bound to the catalytic core. One of the ions participates in structural changes around the cleavage site, and the other binds near the scissile bond [14] .",

Based on the rate of necrotic symptoms, we estimated that around 70% of TMV spreading was stopped (Figs 3B and 4B) , so the hydrolytic properties of short ssRNA could be used in antiviral applications. It is surprising that Pb 2+ can be used as a leadzyme activator. The toxic effects of lead have been linked to many human disorders. The normal blood levels of lead in humans range from 0.1 to 0.2 lm, whereas high levels within the range 0.5-5 lm are known to have deleterious effects on the nervous, renal and reproductive systems [39, 40] . There are many aspects of the effect of lead toxicity on a cell level: protein binding [41, 42] , nonspecific RNA hydrolysis at high concentrations [43, 44] , and specific RNA hydrolysis due to leadzyme motif formation in cis in cellular RNAs [39] . The toxic effects of lead depend on its dose. In our studies, the optimal activity of the leadzyme in vivo in Nicotiana tabacum plants was observed at 5 lm Pb 2+ . No other symptoms except necrosis caused by TMV with both 5 lm Pb 2+ and 10 lm Pb 2+ were seen in tobacco leaves in vivo. Moreover, it was shown that low concentrations of 'stressors' such as Pb 2+ or other heavy metals can have stimulating effects on the growth [43] , photosynthetic oxygen evolution [46, 47] and metabolic activity [48] of plants.",

TMV RNA was transcribed in vitro using the MEGAshortscript T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion). A 100-nucleotide TMV RNA fragment was purified, labeled at the 5\u00a2-end with [c-32 P]ATP and 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) and separated by 10% PAGE with 7 m urea. The radioactive band was cut off, and RNA was eluted with water and precipitated with ethanol. The leadzyme cleavage reaction of TMV RNA was performed in 15 mm Mops (pH 7.5) buffer at 25\u00b0C. Thirty thousand counts per minute of the labeled and 250 nm unlabeled RNA substrate was mixed with 25 lm RNA leadzyme catalytic strand, heated up to 90\u00b0C for 2 min, cooled slowly (1\u00b0C AEmin )1 ) to 25\u00b0C, and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 60 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of Pb 2+ just before incubation and stopped by addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (25 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.1, 1 mm EDTA, 7 m urea, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue). The reaction products were analyzed by 10% PAGE with 7 m urea (pH 8.3).

RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from approximately 150 mg of infected leaf tissue using the RNAqueus-Small Scale Phenol-free Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Reverse transcription was accomplished using 2 lg of RNA samples, hexamer random primers and the Revert-Aid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). An aliquot of cDNA was used for PCR amplification with Taq polymerase (Fermentas) and TMV-specific primers binding upstream (TMV1: 5\u00a2-GCCCAAGGTGAACTTTTCAA-3\u00a2) and downstream (TMV2: 5\u00a2-TAGCGCAATGGCATACACTC-3\u00a2) of the hydrolysis position as well as b-actin primers (Ambion). PCR was performed with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94\u00b0C for 2 min, 20 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. To amplify b-actin cDNA, PCR was carried out with the same conditions, except that the number of cycles was increased to 35. Equal volumes of amplified products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide [23], and quantified by phosphoimager analysis (imagequant, version 5.1, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).",
