The incidence of malignancy in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients was five to 13 times higher than in the normal population [18\u201319]. The appropriate diagnosis and management would decrease health care cost and result in improved quality of life for these patients. The diagnosis of PID was confirmed by immunologic workup [23]. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union of Immunological Societies reported more than 120 groups of PID [24\u201325]. The distributions of PID from several countries [26\u201334], including Thailand [35], showed the highest prevalence in antibody deficiency diseases. However, ethnic differences contributed to different prevalence for some PID. For example, selective IgA deficiency was found to be 1:369 in Finland whereas it was found to be 1:18,500 in Japan [26].",

The PCR products were directly sequenced in both the forward and reverse direction using BigDye (version 1.1) terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

This was found in many studies [43\u201344]. In our study, 24 patients who presented with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections were diagnosed as IgG subclass disproportion (the proportion of each subclass was below normal proportion). These patients did not fulfill the standard diagnostic criteria for IgG subclass deficiency (the level of specific subclass less than two SD of the mean for age with normal or near-normal total IgG concentration). Their data were not included in this study. Nevertheless, these patients had the same presentations as IgG subclass deficiency and demonstrated a decreasing rate of infection after antibiotic prophylaxis. In this study, sepsis in antibody deficiency patients was found to be high (17%) compared to the previous study (10%) [45].
