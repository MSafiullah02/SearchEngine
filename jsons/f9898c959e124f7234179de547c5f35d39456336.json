Surveillance efforts have been instrumental in controlling both diseases. In this study, we provide an overview of surveillance components for the two diseases in Ontario (Canada), as well as PEDV and PDCoV incidence and prevalence measures. Swine herds located in the Province of Ontario, of any type, whose owners agreed to participate in a voluntary industry-led disease control programme (DCP) and with associated diagnostic or epidemiological information about the two swine coronaviruses, were eligible to be included for calculation of disease frequency at the provincial level. PEDV and PDCoV data stored in the industry DCP database were imported into the R statistical software and analysed to produce weekly frequency of incidence counts and prevalence counts, in addition to yearly herd-level incidence risk and prevalence between 2014 and 2016. The yearly herd-level incidence risk of PEDV, based on industry data, was 13.5%, 3.0% and 1.4% (95% CI: 11.1-16.2, 2.0-4.2, 0.8-2.3), while the yearly herd-level incidence risk of PDCoV was 1.1%, 0.3%, and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.5-2.2, 0.1-0.9, 0.0-0.5), for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Herd-level prevalence estimates for PEDV in the last week of 2014, 2015 and 2016 were 4.4%, 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively (95% CI: 3.1-6.0, 1.5-3.3, 0.8-2.2), while herd-level prevalence estimates for PDCoV in the last week of 2014, 2015 and 2016 were 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively (95% CI: 0.1-1.2, 0.0-0.6, 0.0-0.6).

The industry organization (i.e., OSHAB) provided relevant data to researchers for calculation of disease frequencies under a separate data transfer agreement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 388, "text": "(Arruda, Poljak, Friendship, Carpenter, & Hand, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Data sources"}, {"text": "Due to the voluntary nature of the DCP, the enrolment of herds into the database has been an ongoing process. This could have resulted in the date of enrolment being later than the date the infection was originally detected in a specific herd. In rare instances where a herd's enrolment date was not specified or occurred later than the first reported case of PEDV or PDCoV for that herd, the disease status date was entered as the herd enrolment date for the purposes of this report. This was done so that herd-level prevalence on a weekly basis could be properly calculated. An Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection to this database was established, and relevant tables were imported into R (R Core Team, 2016) using the rodbc library (Ripley & Lapsley, 2016 ). . For a premise to be classified as confirmed positive, it had to have an associated diagnostic submission number that includes at least one positive test for PEDV/PDCoV using RT-PCR, regardless of the number of specimens that were submitted. An AHL reference number (also known as a G Number) was not available for some confirmed positive cases in the database, as the attending veterinarian obtained test results, but did not provide OSHAB with the AHL reference number; (ii) presumed positive-premises which housed animals that were moved from positive sites at a prior stage in the production system (i.e., defined as positive due to pig movement). This information was obtained from attending veterinarians based on their knowledge of pig flow and movement, and was not based on diagnostic testing conducted on the premises of interest. For premises to be classified as presumed positive, the herd veterinarian simply needed to indicate that a specific site received pigs from PEDV/PDCoV-positive sites; (iii) presumed negative-previously positive premises, either confirmed or presumed, that were tested using PCR tests according to industry guidelines and had all test results negative. The sampling requirements for declaring premises to be PEDV/PDCoV presumed negative varied based on the combination of herd type and the type of animal flow (i.e., all-in/all-out by barn, or continuous flow nursery and finisher herds). Complete criteria were, at the time of publishing, available on the website of the industry organization (Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board, 2015). Briefly, sampling strategy for farrow-wean, nursery and finisher sites aimed to detect prevalence of virus-positive animals of at least 10%, with expected herd sensitivity of 95%, assumed test sensitivity of 98%, test specificity of 100%. In instances where the sampling material was oral fluid collected through cotton ropes, the assumption was that five pigs contributed oral fluids to one rope, and such fluids were considered a pooled sample. For farrow-finish or farrow-feeder sow sites, the same assumptions were made, except that the sampling strategy was required to detect prevalence of 5% with 95% herd sensitivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 744, "end": 767, "text": "(Ripley & Lapsley, 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Data sources"}, {"text": "Because of alternative strategies, the required sample size varied but a minimum sample size was four oral fluids. In addition, the testing time in sow herds was prescribed to be a minimum of 10 weeks post-infection and was required to be repeated three times in the case of farrow-wean (FW) sites, or two times in the case of farrowfinish (FF) or farrow-feeder (FG) sites. The recommended specimen type could be swab, Swiffer (for covering larger areas in a pen), or oral fluids, depending on the target age group. In FW herds, individual farrowing crates were the target population for each individual sampling occasion, in particular if diarrhoea was evident. The minimum recommendation for one sampling occasion in FW herds was to sample four Swiffer samples, at least eight farrowing crates per one sample. Alternatively, individual swabs of 30 farrowing crates were deemed as acceptable sample after pooling 5:1. In FG farms, the recommended sample type was oral fluid, with recommendation to collect 12 oral fluids from nursery pigs. Similarly, in FF farms, six oral fluids were recommended for collection from nursery pigs and six for collection from finisher pigs. For all-in/all-out nursery and finisher farms, the recommendation was to sample six oral fluids, with added requirement that these herds should be supplied from sow herds with a confirmed negative status. All testing has been assumed to be performed using RT-PCR tests. Full description is available elsewhere (Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB), 2015); (iv) confirmed negative-premises which have had no clinical signs or diagnostic evidence of PEDV/PDCoV for at least 6 months after the presumed negative status date. In addition, herds that were part of the Ontario voluntary DCP but were not tested for emerging porcine coronaviruses-due to lack of clinical or other types of diagnostic or epidemiological triggers-had assigned status of NA (not available). For each week where a herd's PEDV/PDCoV status was not reported, the status was set to the last-reported status using the zoo package (Zeileis & Grothendieck, 2005) . For example, if a status is not reported for the current week, and \"confirmed positive\" was reported for the prior week, then the current week's status is \"confirmed positive.\" The individual premises data were then aggregated to counts of premises on a weekly basis. Based on the former time series, prevalence area plots were generated, providing a visual assessment of \"confirmed positive,\" \"presumed positive,\" \"presumed negative\" and \"confirmed negative\" herds over time. The prevalence numerator was the positive herd count (sum of confirmed positive and presumed positive herds) for a specific week, while the denominator was the herd count in the premises table for that week (calculated previously).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2079, "end": 2109, "text": "(Zeileis & Grothendieck, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Herd-level PEDV and PDCoV infection status definition"}, {"text": "Subsequently, the following disease status changes were tracked by week for each premise: (1) \"Not Available\" to \"Presumed Positive,\"", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Weekly measures of disease frequency"}, {"text": "(2) \"Not Available\" to \"Confirmed Positive,\" (3) \"Presumed Positive\" to \"Presumed Negative,\" (4) \"Presumed Positive\" to \"Confirmed Negative,\"", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Weekly measures of disease frequency"}, {"text": "Any status change leading to new presumed or confirmed positive status (i.e., status changes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10) was classified as new positive.

The latter time series were then used to construct a chart of cumulative incidence counts for each year, and epidemic curves were constructed for positive herds and herds which became negative. In addition, for each week, the incidence risk was calculated by dividing the number of cases that occurred in a specific week and by the number of herds that were eligible to become cases at the beginning of the week. For the yearly incidence rate, we calculated total number of herd-years at risk for each year from the number of herds under risk in each week and used this as a denominator. The incidence rate was then expressed as number of cases per one herd-year. Exact 95% confidence intervals on the incidence rate were obtained via the poisson.test function in R. (Pasma et al., 2016) , and is the first such case in the production system.

The relatively static and low prevalence (0.1%-0.2%) observed between July 2015 and December 2016 suggests that PDCoV is a candidate for disease elimination. There is also a possibility that PDCoV cases are underreported by the industry, either because of potentially lower clinical impact in swine herds or because of perceived lower importance than PEDV.

It could be argued that presumed cases are not diagnostically confirmed and are therefore subject to misclassification. However, the reality of a voluntary DCP for production-limiting diseases is that resources to conduct large-scale testing are scarce and, as such, need to be carefully deployed. Furthermore, in order to confirm premises as presumed negative, diagnostic testing to confirm absence of infection at the design prevalence level is still required.

Note that in the latter figure, the denominator changed on a weekly basis as the number of herds in the voluntary DCP changed.

Consequently, resources available through response by the regulatory veterinary authorities could be limited. In the case of the Ontario outbreak, the regulatory framework existed at the provincial level because PEDV was considered an emerging hazard under the provincial Animal Health Act (Government of Ontario, 2009) and because of suspicion of feed involvement, which is under the jurisdiction of national veterinary authorities. The response to the outbreak was collaborative in nature and is best depicted by the evaluation of surveillance components for PEDV. The OMAFRA and industry approaches were different with respect to surveillance coverage, case definition and follow-up time. OMAFRA surveillance was mostly concerned about identification of new cases and their investigation in the early phase of the outbreak. It contained a census of all PEDV cases, and all", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "Cumulative weekly confirmed and presumed positive cases for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093) F I G U R E 3 Cumulative weekly confirmed and presumed positive cases for porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093) The OSHAB surveillance system was concerned with identification of new cases, reducing dissemination of infection through animal movement, and following the infection status over time for the purposes of monitoring disease trends over time. As a voluntary programme, the source population consisted of premises that volunteered to participate. At the end of 2016, the number of sites in the OSHAB database was 1255, which represents approximately 49% of 2,556 active swine sites in Ontario", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "Number of Herds with confirmed positive, presumed positive, presumed negative or confirmed negative status for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093) F I G U R E 5 Percentage of Herds with confirmed positive, presumed positive, presumed negative or confirmed negative status for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093)laboratory confirmation, as well as secondary sites where movement of PEDV-positive animals occurred although testing was not carried out. This approach allowed identification of~41.8% of cases that would otherwise be unaccounted for in the OMAFRA system (n = 71), which included 30.6% of total cases (n = 52) that were not confirmed through diagnostic testing (Figure 1). Given the purpose of the industry's surveillance system, recording infection in the secondary sites was a logical choice as they could still contribute to disease dissemination through multiple pathways. Such premises had to be declared as presumed or confirmed negative, based on diagnostic testing that met pre-determined criteria conducted on the premises.The Venn diagram of surveillance components(Figure 1) also shows a large volume of positive test results for PEDV in aF I G U R E 6 Number of Herds with confirmed positive, presumed positive, presumed negative or confirmed negative status for porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093) F I G U R E 7 Percentage of Herds with confirmed positive, presumed positive, presumed negative or confirmed negative status for porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Ontario (Canada) for 2014-2016, based on data provided in the Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB) Disease Control Program (DCP) database (average number of herds for 2014-2016 = 1093) laboratory that did not contribute to the identification of new cases. Such testing serves different purposes and likely contains additional surveillance components which are not considered here. An example is testing trailers in abattoirs for the purposes of case identification through risk-based approaches. Surveillance systems for emerging diseases could benefit from a clearer definition of such surveillance components, so that diagnostic tests could be easily aggregated into appropriate streams. The collaborative efforts at controlling PEDV are most clearly seen in the incidence counts for 2014. As expected at the onset of any outbreak, particularly due to massive contamination through a common source, there was a rapid climb in the number of infected farms. However, this outbreak was brought under control relatively quickly. By May 2014, the worst of the outbreak was over, and there were only single digit weekly infections (no more than 5) for the remainder of the year. In addition, the initially positive herds which contributed to the rapid climb in infections between January and May 2014 became negative within a short period and contributed to the rapid increase in negative herds between June and December 2014. The incidence counts for 2015 reveal a more proactive approach to OSHAB PEDV surveillance and disease control. Not only were there substantially fewer infections (infections were only reported for 15 weeks out of the year, and there were at most 5 infections per week), the number of negative herds also kept up with the number of positive herds (for 9 of the 15 weeks where infections were reported, there were also negative herds). Overall, the number of negative herds in 2015 outpaced the number of positive herds, indicating proactive steps to minimize the number of new infections while aggressively taking steps to eradicate existing ones. This stands in stark contrast to 2014, where disease eradication efforts only seemed to take on momentum towards the latter half of the year. The trend in incidence counts from 2015 continued into 2016, with lower numbers for positive herds and the number of negative herds outpacing positive ones. However, in contrast to 2015, roughly 75% of new infections occurred in the first quarter of the year (January-March), while 80% of new negative herds were reported in the last quarter of the year (late September-December). The cluster of negative herds at the end of the year suggests that with new infections under control, emphasis was placed on the management of prevalent cases, taking into consideration lower viral transmission during warmer periods of the year. The prevalence plots reveal ebbs and inclines in PEDV prevalence, in what appears to be a cyclical pattern: a peak in July 2014, a low in January 2015, a peak in July 2015, a low in October 2015 and a peak in February 2016 (Figure 4). The numbers were relatively constant from late February to July 2016, declined in late July and slowly declined until the end of the year. Given the prevalence fluctuations between 1% and 2% for September 2015-December 2016 (Figure 5), and the repeated patterns, there is a danger that PED may become an endemic disease with low prevalence and limited pockets of infection in Ontario. As such, further investigation and action are needed to ensure that the peaks are replaced by a steady decline.As the same disease prevention and control measures for PEDV also apply to PDCoV (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs, 2014), there were few reported infections for PDCoV (essentially, controlling for PEDV also controls for PDCoV). It is therefore not surprising that the incidence count patterns are similar: in 2014, there were more PDCoV-positive herds than negative herds, while in 2015, there were more negative herds than positive ones. However, in 2016 there was just one new PDCoV infection, with a single herd also becoming negative, an indication that if current disease control efforts continue, there may be no new infections in subsequent years.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "PEDV-positive cases are strictly in OSHAB and are not reported in any other surveillance component.
