            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV), a member of the Circoviridae family, is a small, non-enveloped, spherical single-stranded DNA virus. There are two types of PCVs, namely PCV1 and PCV2. Both of them are presumed to be widespread in the swine population. Though PCV1 is considered to be nonpathogenic (Allan et al., 1995), it can infect human leukocytes in vitro, and is now considered to be a potential risk for viral transmission when porcine tissues and organs are used for xenotransplantation (Arteaga-Troncoso et al., 2005). PCV2 is associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) (Clark, 1997, Harding and Clark, 1997), porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) (Rosell et al., 2000). Furthermore, PCV2 may damage the immune system and induce immunosuppression, which results in other pathogenyes coinfection (Segales et al., 2004). Although, vaccine for PCV2 has been developed recently, the efficiency still needs to be tested in the field trials. Thus, new method development for controlling PCV2 infection is urgently necessary.",

These include capsid protein RNA (CR), eight Rep-associated RNAs (Rep, Rep\u2032, Rep3a, Rep3b, Rep3c-1, Rep3c-2, Rep3c-3, Rep3c-4), and three NS-associated RNAs (NS462, NS642 and NS0). For PCV2, five Rep-associated RNAs (Rep, Rep\u2032, Rep3a, Rep3b and Rep3c), and three NS-associated RNAs (NS515, NS672 and NS0), are synthesized during replication in PK-15 cells (Cheung, 2003a). Two proteins derived from ORF1, the full-length (Rep) and the spliced (Rep\u2032), are essential for PCV DNA replication (Mankertz and Hillenbrand, 2001). It has been reported that mutations in Rep or truncated Rep\u2032 proteins of PCV2 can cause more than a 99% reduction in viral protein synthesis and completely shut down viral DNA replication (Cheung, 2003b). It is, therefore, suggested that Rep or Rep\u2032 could be a target for inhibition of PCV replication.",

However, its molecular mechanism remained unclear until the 1990s, when an elegant work in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved gene-silencing mechanism (Fire et al., 1998). The post-translational silencing of gene expression occurs in response to the introduction of homologous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into a cell. This phenomenon can result in highly specific suppression of gene expression. In the past few years, RNAi has become widely used as an experimental tool to analyze the function of genes and it represents a new feasible approach to develop effective antiviral treatments. RNAi antiviral therapy has been shown to inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (Capodici et al., 2002), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Wang et al., 2004), influenza virus (Ge et al., 2004) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Chen et al., 2004). Therefore, RNAi would accordingly serve as a new strategy for battling viral infections.",

It is necessary to find an efficient method for PCV treatment. In this study, we used the eukaryotic expression vector pRep1-EGFP/pRep2-EGFP as a reporting system to monitor the function of the siRNAs. Rep1 and Rep2 expression were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results revealed that pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC specifically inhibited Rep expression and PCV production in PK-15 cells. Furthermore, we found that siRNAs which inhibited Rep expression can also decrease Cap protein expression in PCV infected cells. These results were in agreement with a recent study that found that shRNA could not only significantly reduce its corresponding mRNA level but inhibited other viral gene transcription as well (J. Liu et al., 2006). It is, therefore, assumed that siRNAs initiate the degradation of Rep mRNA, which then results in blockage of PCV replication and protein synthesis.",

This indicates that the best target site seems to be close to the midpoint of the gene. Recently, siRNAs targeted against PCV2 infection in cells and mouse models were reported. The authors demonstrated that the siRNAs targeting the Rep gene of PCV2 at nts 624\u2013642 was most effective (J. Liu et al., 2006). In our previous study, we also found that two siRNAs targeting the middle sequence of NS1 more efficiently inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus replication in BHK-21 cells (X. Liu et al., 2006). This phenomenon may be due to different positional accessibility caused by steric hindrance by a secondary or tertiary structure and/or protein binding (Yuan et al., 2005). In addition, analysis of ORF1 of PCV2 has shown 83% nucleotide and 86% predicted protein homology with PCV1. It suggests that siRNAs targeting same sequence of Rep1 and Rep2 may be efficient for both PCV1 and PCV2. In this study, we firstly reported that three siRNAs targeting the same sequence of Rep1 and Rep2 can inhibit Rep expression and viral production of PCV1 and PCV2.",
