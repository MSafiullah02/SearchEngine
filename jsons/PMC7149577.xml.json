A few years later, in the early 1950s, Burnet demonstrated \u2018high frequency recombination\u2019 (later called genetic reassortment) between different strains of influenza A virus. Intramolecular recombination was demonstrated with herpes simplex virus in 1955 and with vaccinia virus in 1958 and the first crude maps (of vaccinia virus) were described soon after. Hirst demonstrated that intramolecular recombination could occur among RNA viruses in experiments with poliovirus in 1962 and Cooper published a genetic map of poliovirus in 1968.",

Morphology was powerfully supplemented as the basis for classification as the genomes of viruses were analyzed and their extraordinary variety demonstrated. Finally, as work proceeded on the replication mechanisms, a third criterion for classification was developed, the strategy\nof viral replication. Currently eight families of DNA and 16 families of RNA animal viruses are recognized. The genomes of most DNA viruses are double stranded (ds) and range in size from 3.2 to 280 kbp; others have genomes of ssDNA ranging from 1.8 to 5 kb. Some genomes are linear, others circular; among viruses with ssDNA some are of positive sense, some of negative sense.",

Subsequently several hundred of these enzymes have been identified and purified from various bacteria. Each recognizes a unique short, palindromic sequence of nucleotides (a sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards), generally four to eight nucleotide pairs long. Depending upon the location and frequency of the specific unique sequence in a particular DNA molecule, a particular restriction endonuclease cleaves the DNA into a precise number of fragments of precise sizes. Other endonucleases, recognizing different sequences, cleave the same DNA into different numbers and sizes of fragments. These DNA fragments, produced by a panel of endonucleases, may be separated by gel electrophoresis. Different viruses, often even very closely related strains of the same virus, yield characteristically different restriction endonuclease fragment patterns, sometimes called fingerprints or restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFPL). These have been invaluable for distinguishing between different species of viruses with large genomes, such as the various poxviruses. Restriction enzymes can also be used to analyze the molecularly cloned cDNA copies of genes or genomes from RNA viruses. Once the restriction maps of a virus have been determined, the location of many genetic markers, such as temperature-sensitive mutations, at specific locations on the viral genome can be determined by rescue of the deleterious mutation by the corresponding wildtype restriction fragment.",

When the replicating recombinant molecules are placed in a situation where their genetic information can be expressed, the polypeptide specified by the foreign DNA is produced. These results are usually achieved by incorporating the foreign DNA into a bacteriophage or a plasmid, which serves as a cloning vector for introducing the foreign DNA into bacterial or other cells. Vectors are available that replicate in bacteria, yeasts, animal cells and intact animals. For animal cells, a variety of animal viruses can be used as vectors, SV40, retroviruses and vaccinia virus being popular choices.

Open reading frames (ORF), which are long translational sequences uninterrupted by stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA), suggest the presence of protein coding sequences, especially if the codons for given amino acids occur with the frequency found in known protein coding sequences of the virus. The function of the predicted protein can sometimes be surmised by the similarity of its imputed sequence to that of a protein of known function. Such comparisons are carried out by searching international computer-based databases of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Thus the existence of vaccinia growth factor was predicted when sequence analysis of the vaccinia virus genome revealed an ORF similar to that of known mammalian growth factors. It is also possible from an examination of the sequence to predict that specific portions of a predicted protein will have particular functions, such as signal sequences for targeting proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum or the plasma membrane, transmembrane sequences, glycosylation sites and nucleotide binding sites. Short sequence motifs can be identified which serve as signals in gene expression. Methionine codons (AUG) used to initiate translation are found at the beginning of ORFs, embedded in a consensus sequence GCCGCC/GCCAUGG. Sites of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation are usually signaled by AAUAAA followed by certain other signals.

Combined with the availability of simple and fast methods of sequencing nucleic acids, genetic engineering has also led to studies of animal virus genomes that could not be contemplated before it became possible to produce large quantities of selected fragments of viral nucleic acid by the use of the polymerase chain reaction. Among the achievements so far are: 1.\nComplete sequencing of the genome of DNA viruses of several families, including the 230 kbp genome of cytomegalovirus (a herpesvirus) and the 192 kbp genome of vaccinia virus.2.Complete sequencing of cDNA corresponding to the entire genome of several RNA viruses.3.Recognition of the number and sequence of viral or proviral DNAs hat are integrated into the DNA of transformed cells.4.Development of diagnostic probes for use in in vitro assays, including in situ hybridization.5.The polymerase chain reaction can be used to detect low copy number of a viral genome.6.Marker rescue by transfection with gene fragments, as a method of genetic mapping.7.Production of proteins coded by specific viral genes, using bacterial, yeast, baculovirus and animal cell expression systems or by cell-free translation.8.Synthesis of peptides based on DNA sequence data.\n",

            "text": "Transgenic mice provide a new tool for investigating many problems in virology, immunology and developmental biology. They are produced by injecting selected fragments of DNA into the nuclei of fertilized eggs washed out of the mouse oviduct. After replacement, some ova develop normally to form the base of a colony of transgenic mice. The technique provides insights into the potential role in viral pathogenesis of individual viral gene products in the context of the intact animal. For example, transgenic mice have been produced in which every cell contained greater than genome length hepatitis B DNA sequences. All mice had HBs antigen in plasma, but the viral sequences were selectively expressed only in cells of the liver, kidney and pancreas. Likewise, transgenic mice containing the DNA for the early region of bovine papilloma virus developed skin tumors at 8\u20139 months of age. Extrachromosomal viral DNA was detected in tumor cells and integrated viral DNA in normal tissues.",
