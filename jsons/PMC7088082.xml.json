Newly emerging diseases caused by entirely novel or previously unrecognized pathogens, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and hantavirus, or those whose modes of transmission are currently under study, as in the case of Ebola and Nipah, represent yet another significant challenge. Certainly the mechanisms or processes of disease emergence involve factors in addition to those at molecular and cellular levels. These include climate, rainfall, ocean and air circulation patterns, and extreme weather events, as well as the ecology of the pathogens\u2019 reservoirs and vectors, namely those factors associated with larger-scale mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of ecosystems in which parasite (pathogen) and host relationships are embedded (Horwitz and Wilcox, 2005). Still other factors are involved, and must be identified, if a truly holistic framework is to be constructed that incorporates factors related to human and societal mechanisms.",

The use of antimicrobials, pesticides, and biological controls predictably are effecting changes in pathogens, hosts, and ecological systems, and often unwittingly facilitating disease emergence or reemergence (Lederberg et al., 1992; Gubler, 1998; Burroughs et al., 2003; Knobler et al., 2003; Smolinski et al., 2003). Antibiotic resistant Strepococcus A and E. coli 0:157 are prime examples. Pathogens and their hosts, including humans, reproduce, grow, and adapt in an environmental context, devastatingly exemplified by the avian influenza threat (chickens, ducks, pigs, and humans in close confines). This context is most accurately captured using a holistic or systems perspective, considering sub-systems at different levels of organization\u2014those at lower levels embedded within those at successively higher levels\u2014including social as well as physical, chemical, and biological components.",

Several investigators, including social scientists, conceived and elaborated on similar themes using different terminology. Ecological and social scientists working on ecosystem and natural resources management challenges refer to \u201csocial\u2013ecological systems\u201d (Berkes and Folke, 1998; Berkes et al., 2003) or \u201chuman and natural systems\u201d (Gunderson and Holling, 2002). The contraction of social\u2013ecological systems, \u201csocioecological systems,\u201d has been used to describe this same systems perspective, stressing coupled human\u2013natural systems and complexity theory, in the context of health and emerging infectious diseases (Waltner-Toews, 2001). The hyphenated or contracted terms share with biocomplexity an emphasis on the interaction of humans and nature as a complex system, and arguably embrace what is fundamentally the same paradigm. For convenience in this article, we will refer to \u201chuman\u2013natural systems perspective\u201d as synonymous with \u201cbiocomplexity.\u201d We also note these ideas, including those associated with \u201ceco-epidemiology\u201d expressing the need for a broadened concept of causality in epidemiology (Kaufman and Poole, 2000), are part of a larger emerging paradigm called \u201cpost-normal science\u201d by some investigators (Ravetz, 1999).",

The objective of this meeting was to facilitate interdisciplinary research on the problem of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Our aim here is to provide a short review and synthesis of these interdisciplinary approaches and insights emerging from the meeting and reported in the recent literature. We use the case of cholera, the current scientific understanding of which currently provides a basis for the most complete human\u2013natural systems model of any EID, and a complementary model based on zoonotic and vectorborne EIDs in general. Together, with two published EID case studies from this meeting, a framework is developing that has significant potential for explaining the phenomenon of global infectious disease emergence. We believe the approach has significant bearing on the interdisciplinary methodology of emerging infectious disease research, and suggests future research directions, as well as prospects for managing infectious disease emergence.",

Cholera is historically the most studied infectious disease, since the discovery of its etiology established the theory of communicable diseases and the field of epidemiology (Snow, 1855). The relatively recent discovery (Huq et al., 1983; Colwell, 1996) of the connection of cholera with the natural environment and ecological processes has dramatically broadened the scope of cholera research. With a few exceptions, zoonotic and vectorborne diseases are, in general, readily understood as having links with the natural environment. However, the connection between their epidemiology and ecosystem dynamics or processes, not to mention coupled human\u2013natural system behavior, is only now beginning to be appreciated. Some EIDs like SARS, Ebola, even HIV/AIDS, and the more recent and disturbingly potentially disastrous avian influenza (Aldhous and Tomlin, 2005; Osterholm, 2005) are diseases that effectively originate as zoonotic parasites or pathogens whose transmission cycles can become completely uncoupled from their animal reservoirs.",

The world has become so integrated and global (with international arrivals per year in the U.S. alone in the hundreds of millions), that the notion that a disease can be completely eradicated has become simplistic. Infectious disease is a moving target, and as the climate, as well as other sources of natural or anthropogenic environmental variation changes, any disease that has an environmentally sensitive stage, reservoir, or vector will be affected. Thus, the simplistic view must be expanded to recognize that neither ecosystems nor the pathogens that live in them respond linearly to environmental changes. Moreover, many environmental events such as climate change and seasonality, but particularly associated meteorological and oceanographic events, are inherently unpredictable by present models. The expanding field of global climate research must include the human dimension, i.e., infectious diseases. Incorporating a prediction based on signals from climate models into health measures can thereby provide new opportunities for proactive, rather than reactive, approaches to public health.",

Cholera has recurred in Peru since then, following a seasonal pattern, with the greatest number of cases in summer (June\u2013March) in Lima and other major cities along the coast. The detection of V. cholerae followed both ambient and sea surface temperature increases and coincided with, or preceded, annual outbreaks of cholera in summer (Huq and Colwell, 2003; Lipp et al., 2003). Off the Peruvian coast, there was a significant correlation between cholera incidence and elevated sea surface temperature from October 1997\u2013June 2000, which included the 1997\u20131998 El Ni\u00f1o event (Gil et al., 2004). This link suggests that an early-warning system for cholera risk could be established for Peru and neighboring countries. Although not related directly, both El Ni\u00f1o events and cholera outbreaks have increased since the 1970s. This pattern has emerged in both Peruvian waters and the Bay of Bengal. Sea surface temperature and height, as well as plankton blooms, can be remotely sensed and thus used to forecast outbreaks of cholera (Colwell, 1996).",

The linkage of disease cycles over a four decade time series with regional climate, rainfall, river discharge, and flooding has now been demonstrated (Koelle et al., 2005). This body of research establishes the linkages across time and space scales in the dynamics of the regional system, the pathogen, and nonlinear human susceptibility levels. The picture that has emerged is that of a causal chain involving regional climatic patterns, river basin rainfall variability, river discharge and flooding, and transmission variability. The interannual variability shows a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods (for over 7 years for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods (under 7 years for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation).

Yet striking similarities with cholera are surfacing that suggest its emergence follows a similar pattern of coupled human\u2013natural system dynamics. Outbreaks commonly are associated with seasonal rainfall and floods, and like cholera, according to local knowledge held by taro farmers (Vinetz et al., 2005), with drought conditions. If confirmed, this would lend further support to a disease emergence model incorporating the effects of anthropogenic environmental change on the hydroecology of natural drainage basins (local watersheds or river basins), contributing to decreased ecological resilience and, thereby, an increased frequency of extreme floods and droughts (Kaneshiro et al., 2005; [Wilcox et al., unpublished data]). Even without an increase in climate variability predicted to occur with anthropogenic global climate change, the interaction of natural rainfall variability with land use changes (e.g., increasing impervious surface area associated with urbanization) can explain, and is predicted to contribute to, both increased flood and drought conditions. Either appears to promote pathogen spread and survival in the environment, host\u2013host transmission, higher prevalence in host reservoirs, increased environmental contamination by pathogenic bacteria shed by hosts, and the increased risk of human exposure as a causal chain.",

Expressing these relationships, which produce nonlinear behavior, including the abrupt and as yet unpredictable changes in microorganisms, their ecology, and the infectious diseases they cause, is very difficult. However, a human\u2013natural systems perspective has begun to provide some insights into how to approach the problem of at least predicting the circumstances that facilitate disease emergence.

This could be extended to emerging infectious diseases and be termed \u201cthe pathology of infectious disease control.\u201d The basic features of the new synthesis by Holling (2001) and Holling et al. (2002) are most readily explained in terms of the definitions of the core concepts involved (Table 1). A remarkable feature of this \u201cmodel\u201d is its demonstration of how disease emergence results from the interaction of variables on vastly different time and space scales, as alluded to above (Fig. 2). While pathogen life cycles and human infection events, for example, act as \u201cfast variables\u201d with periodicities on the scale of days, weeks, or less, regional environmental and global climate change represent \u201cslow variables\u201d with periodicities on the scale of decades or longer. These variables interact through the mediation of cross-scale influences, for example, floods or drought, and their increased severity because of the loss of ecological resilience arising from anthropogenic land use change. The regional environmental change model of disease emergence and the ecological resilience model noted above, that incorporates the role of extreme weather events, readily integrate into a single general model that largely explains the current global EID phenomenon.

However, the persistent reduction in mosquitoes led to gradual increases in the number of people susceptible to malaria and mosquitoes resistant to insecticide.

Although new infections are reported annually on a lesser scale (approximately 50 million) than cholera and malaria, dengue has become one of the most troubling global infectious diseases, because it is reemerging at a faster rate, with a more severe form (dengue hemorrhagic fever), than perhaps any other. As summarized by Spiegel et al. (2005) and described previously (Gubler, 1997; Pinheiro and Corber, 1997), dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) has gone from being an insignificant health problem 20 years ago to one of the world\u2019s most important global public health problems today. Clearly, the interaction of key policy changes in vector control strategy with dramatic changes in demographic and social conditions accompanying unplanned urbanization can be concluded to be responsible for reemergence of DF/DHF in the Americas (Gubler, 2002a).",

Outside its native range in Africa from which it spread (and ultimately the dengue virus with it) centuries ago, A. egypti\u2019s adaptability to domestic environments, including its capability of readily breeding inside dwellings, makes the disease difficult to control in the absence of integrated \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d vector control programs, beginning virtually at the neighborhood level. A. egypti had been, in fact, all but eliminated from Latin America by the 1970s, but its geographic distribution has since reexpanded and now extends from Paraguay to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. While many governments and agencies carried out ineffective, if any, vector control programs, the mosquito\u2019s habitat (human settlements) and the virus\u2019 host population (humans) grew exponentially. Ironically, reducing dengue to its pre-1970\u2019s level will require a vastly greater effort than before. This time, not only will it require a much higher level of planning and coordination of vector control efforts, but many of the same challenges facing global sustainability: increased rates of human migration, driven by poverty and political instability, and sprawling and overcrowded cities, where unscreened housing, dense residential areas with large numbers of household breeding sites (e.g., nonbiodegradable containers), and absence of waste management, sewer and water systems, produce ideal conditions for mosquito breeding.",

Such cross-scale processes are, however, characteristic of ecosystems (Holling, 1992) and coupled human\u2013natural systems (Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Berkes et al., 2003), whose dynamics are influenced by the interaction of variables and dynamics operating on vastly different time and space scales that involve natural processes discontinuously distributed, as shown in Figure 3. An essential component of this dynamic, not easily conveyed visually (at least within the graphical representation of time and space scales), is that of resilience as a variable, both in the human and natural sub-systems comprising the human\u2013natural environment (or social\u2013ecological system) as a whole. This can be envisioned as the increased or diminished capacity of the system to absorb impacts of periodic events, whose timing and location is inherently unpredictable, at least at the level of current scientific understanding and available models. For example, deforestation lessens the capacity of a watershed or river basin to absorb storm events and prevent excessive runoff that is laden with nutrients and/or pathogens contributing to disease emergence. Similarly, narrowly focused and inflexible bureaucracies are unable to detect and learn from such events, so as to be able to respond with appropriate measures that either address the problem of lost resilience in the natural environment or increased vulnerability of human populations to infections, outbreaks, or epidemics\u2014as the pathogen expands from a local toward a global scale, via cross-scale influences. The spread of waterborne pathogens by flooding and other pathogens by human migration, transport, or other spreading modalities, is illustrated by the widening plume in the center of the space-time graph (Fig. 3).\n\n",

Though at first considered too simplistic (Rogers and Randolph, 2000), the malaria models have attempted to incorporate an increasing realism, taking into account altitudinal instead of latitudinal shifts alone, and the adaptive capacity of public health infrastructure, in addition to socioeconomic conditions (Haines and Patz, 2004; van Lieshout et al., 2004). The MARA (Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa) project is one such example. Derived maps of malaria suitability (based on climate) were compared with previously collected, independent data including surveys, site visits, parasite rates, and spleen rates gathered in several East African countries and providing a more thorough validation than past climate-malaria modeling (MARA/AMRA, 1998). Excluding any increase in population, an increase of 16%\u201328% in person-month exposure to malaria risk by year 2100 was determined (Tanser et al., 2003). In spite of these improvements and the availability of increasingly high resolution geographic data, the reliability of projections for vectorborne diseases, in general, has been hampered by the complex and nonlinear dynamics of the relationship between the vector population and disease prevalence. This is a result of the interactions between transmission rates, the rate of development and duration of temporary acquired immunity, and the age structure of the population, for which the field data are too limited to resolve (Rogers et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Although progress awaits better and more field surveillance data and modeling methods that combine the power of multivariate statistical analysis with the realism of complex systems thinking, a significant amount of ecological theory and empirical data exists that link anthropogenic environmental change and pathogen emergence. Moreover, the validity and robustness of some of the key relationships, including the quantitative expressions describing them, are beyond dispute. For example, the mechanisms involved and the relationship of species extinction to habitat loss, in general (Rosenzweig, 1995), and the case of tropical forest, in particular (Laurence and Bierregaard, 1997), are relatively well understood, empirically demonstrated, and follow quantitative rules that are among the most thoroughly documented in ecology. The effect of climate change on habitat in terms of latitudinal and altitudinal shifts resulting in the contraction in the areal extent of many types of habitat is virtually certain. So, too, is the corresponding reduction in the sizes of local and regional populations of vulnerable wildlife species. These direct impacts on natural ecological communities, along with the effects of urbanization and agricultural intensification shown in Figure 2, undoubtedly will affect pathogen emergence in ecosystems through multiple feedback loops linking ecosystem disturbance, local extinction, and disease (Harvell et al., 2002). Ecosystem-focused infectious disease research will require monitoring and surveillance that integrate wildlife and human disease (Deem et al., 2005).",

Regional environmental change, which is influenced significantly by population growth, resource consumption, and waste generation, plays an important role in the emergence of infectious disease, especially in tropical developing regions. Associated land use and transformation of resource production (urbanization, agricultural expansion and intensification, and natural habitat alteration), have produced changes in ecological systems, notably in landscapes and, in turn, their natural communities and ultimately in their pathogen, animal host, and human populations. Thus, the altered \u201chost-pathogen\u201d dynamics facilitate novelty, including exchange of genetic material among pathogens, resulting in rapid adaptations by the pathogens and more frequent generation of novel pathogen variants. Some will be more virulent, infective, and/or capable of enhanced transmission, contributing to disease reemergence or emergence. Factors related to public health infrastructure and climate variability, and their interactions with regional environmental change, also contribute significantly to disease emergence. In addition to natural climate variability and climate shifts, the climate change contribution of global warming may well contribute further to disease emergence.",

Climate variability and meteorological events, with distinct periodicities and occurring on specific geographic scales, interact with the dynamics of the pathogen\u2013host (human populations in this example) that occur on similar scales. For example, a local windstorm or rainstorm can disperse mosquitoes or waterborne pathogens within a locality. Factors, such as social behavior and specific environmental conditions that are characteristic for a given human population, can determine whether or not a disease agent will flourish in an environment and be transmitted among hosts, including humans, in a particular settlement. Meteorological events that affect the environment, such as seasonal monsoon rains or the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which occur on a larger scale in time and space, can induce drought or flood conditions. The result can be the spread of a disease agent(s), setting the stage for epidemics, the occurrence of which will, in turn, depend on human population factors, such as human behavior and the level of herd immunity. Additional variables can facilitate disease emergence, i.e., increased connectivity created by urbanization, increased rate of regional migration, and global transport; and/or decreased social and ecological system resilience, resulting, for example, in more severe and larger scale impacts of the meteorological event.",
