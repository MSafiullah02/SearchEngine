            "text": "The 5\u00a2-terminal leader sequence of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) genome contains an open reading frame (ORF) with an AUG codon in a suboptimal context for initiation of protein synthesis. To investigate the significance of this intraleader ORF (ILO), an expression plasmid was generated carrying a DNA copy of the subgenomic mRNA7 behind a T7 promoter. Capped RNA transcribed from this construct was shown to direct, in an in vitro translation system, the synthesis of leader peptide as well as N protein. Site-directed mutations aimed to either optimize or weaken the sequence context of the ILO start codon affected leader peptide synthesis as predicted; no peptide was detected when the initiation codon was incapacitated. Translation of the downstream N gene was inversely affected by leader peptide production, consistent with a ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism. To investigate the role of the leader peptide in the EAV replication life cycle we generated, using an infectious EAV cDNA clone, two mutant viruses in one of which the ILO start codon was in an optimal Kozak context for translation initiation while in the other the codon was again incapacitated. Surprizingly, both mutant viruses were equally viable and exhibited similar phenotypes in BHK-21 cells. However, their replication kinetics and viral yields were reduced relative to that of the wild-type parental virus, as were their plaque sizes. Importantly, the mutations introduced into the viruses appeared to be rapidly and precisely repaired upon passaging. Already after one viral passage a significant fraction of the viruses had regained the wild-type sequence as well as its phenotype. The results demonstrate that EAV replication is not dependent on the synthesis of the intraleader peptide. Rather, the leader peptide does not seem to have any function in the EAV life cycle. As we discuss, the available data indicate that the ILO 5\u00a2 nucleotide sequence per se, not its functioning in translation initiation, is of critical importance for EAV replication.",

The EAV genome is a positive, single-stranded, 5\u00a2-capped and 3\u00a2-polyadenylated mRNA molecule with a length of 12,704 nucleotides (nt). During EAV replication, a 3\u00a2-coterminal nested set of seven virus-specific RNAs (RNAs 1 through 7) is produced which direct the synthesis of structural and non-structural viral proteins [2] . Each open reading frame (ORF) in the EAV genome is preceded by the pentanucleotide sequence motif 5\u00a2-UCAAC-3\u00a2, also called the leader-body junction site [3, 4] or the transcription regulating sequence (TRS) [5] . The TRS motifs, in conjunction with neighboring nt, are key elements involved in the synthesis of the 3\u00a2-coterminal nested set of six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs [6, 7] through their fusion, most likely by a discontinuous minus-strand transcription mechanism, with a common leader sequence of 206 nt identical to and derived from the extreme 5\u00a2 terminus of the viral genome [8] .",

This ILO was predicted to encode a peptide of 37 amino acids and appeared to be conserved among different EAV isolates [10] which suggested that it may be of functional significance for the virus. Further analysis showed that the ILO start codon was present in a suboptimal context to initiate protein translation, which might explain the efficient translation of the ORFs located downstream of the leader sequence on each EAV mRNA. Because short ORFs within the 5\u00a2 leader region of other viral mRNAs have been reported to down-regulate the rate of translation of downstream ORFs [11] [12] [13] , we hypothesized that the EAV ILO might similarly affect the synthesis of the EAV proteins or have another regulatory function in the life cycle of the virus.",

As primer for cDNA synthesis, an oligonucleotide (Peav3\u00a2) complementary to the extreme 3\u00a2 end of the EAV genomic and sg viral RNAs was used. The cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a primer pair consisting of the antisense oligonucleotide Peav3\u00a2 and the sense oligonucleotide P(wt)atg which corresponds to the extreme 5\u00a2 end of the EAV leader sequence (Table 1) . By doing so, we generated a DNA copy of EAV mRNA7 downstream of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter, which was introduced by the sense primer. After agarose gel purification, the RNA7-specific DNA fragment was cut with BamHI and SalI and ligated into BamHI-and SalI-digested plasmid vector pUC18 (InVitrogen). The resulting plasmid, designated F7wtATG, was sequenced to verify the correctness of the cloned fragment.

In this pBR322-based construct, the genomic sequence of the Utrecht variant of the Bucyrus strain of EAV is preceded by a bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. To generate three new EAV cDNA clones, a series of PCRs was performed by using plasmid pBRNX1.038 as a template, the ORF 1a-specific oligonucleotide P962 as an antisense primer, and the leader-specific oligonucleotides PT7(wt)atg, PT7(ko) atg, or PT7(opt)atg as alternative sense primers (Table 1). The resulting PCR products were digested with NotI and ApoI and stored as fragments of 897 nt in length until used. Another aliquot of plasmid pBRNX1.038 was digested with the unique restriction enzymes NotI and EcoRV, which generates fragments of 12,672 and 4,282 nt, respectively. The small fragment, which contained the SP6 promoter sequence and the wild-type ILO start codon, was purified from the gel and digested with ApoI to obtain a 891-nt NotI-ApoI fragment and a 3391-nt ApoI-EcoRV fragment. The latter DNA fragment was gel-purified and stored until further use. It is noteworthy that there was a 6 nt difference in length between the NotI-ApoI fragments generated by PCR and the NotI-ApoI fragment obtained by digestion of plasmid pBRNX1.038. This difference is due to the insertion of a KpnI site between the NotI site and the T7 promoter sequence in primers PT7(wt)atg, PT7(ko)atg and PT7(opt)atg ( Table 1 ). The additional KpnI site allowed us to distinguish, by restriction enzyme analysis, the original SP6 promoter-containing infectious cDNA clone pBRNX1.038 from the newly generated T7 promotercontaining full-length EAV cDNA clones.",

Accordingly, we were able to successfully generate a rabbit antiserum directed against a synthetic version of the protein. However, with this serum, we failed to detect the IL peptide in EAV-infected cells either by immunofluorescence, or by Western blot, or by RIPA (data not shown). We next generated a plasmid (F7wtATG) containing the EAV mRNA7 sequence downstream of a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In vitro transcripts derived from F7wtATG were translated in vitro and the translation products were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2a (lane 1) , polypeptide species of 14 and 4 kDa were detected corresponding to the N protein and the IL peptide, respectively. This result demonstrates that EAV mRNA7 is functionally bicistronic. Because the ILO start codon present in this wild-type construct is in the suboptimal context for translation initiation (13), we decided to introduce point mutations at the 5\u00a2 end of the ILO to improve or abrogate its translation. As shown in Fig. 2a (lanes 2 and 3) , the IL peptides from mutant plasmids F7(koz)ATG and F7(opt)ATG (in which the context of the ILO initiation codon was improved) were detected at levels comparable to that of the wild-type construct. As expected, lower amounts of the IL peptide were obtained with the construct F7(nf)ATG which had the ILO AUG codon placed in an unfavorable context for initiation of translation (Fig. 2a, lane 5) . No translation product was observed from the mutant clone F7())ATG in which the ILO initiation codon was abrogated (Fig. 2a, lane 4) . To confirm that the 4 kDa translation product is encoded by the ILO, RIPAs were performed using the rabbit anti-IL peptide serum or the corresponding preimmune serum (Fig. 2b) . This experiment proved that the 4 kDa protein is encoded by the ILO and corroborated the previous finding that the amount of IL peptide synthesized depends on the context of the ILO start codon. We next analyzed the effect of the mutations around the ILO start codon on the production of the N protein. As shown in Fig. 3 , an approximately two-fold increase (as determined by densitometric analysis) in the amount of N protein was observed with the mutant constructs F7())ATG (lane 2) or F7(nf)ATG (lane 3) relative to that of the wild-type plasmid F7(wt)ATG (lane 1). In contrast, slightly diminished N protein levels (15-20% less) were obtained with in vitro transcripts from the mutant clones F7(opt)ATG and F7(koz)ATG (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Thus, we concluded that translation of the ILO has a negative effect on N protein synthesis. These results are suggestive of a leaky scanning mechanism [13] for translation of the ORF immediately downstream of the EAV leader sequence in each viral (sg) mRNA.",

As shown in Fig. 5 , the recombinant wild-type virus (recEAV[wt]AUG-P0) (panel G) yielded a homogeneous population of large plaques with an average diameter of 5 mm. The size and morphology of these plaques were similar to those of the recombinant viruses recEAV(ko-to-wt)AUG-P0 (panel C) and re-cEAV(opt-to-wt)AUG-P0 (panel F) and to those of the Bucyrus strain of EAV (panel I) which were used as controls. In contrast, plaques of variable size were obtained for the mutant viruses recEAV(ko)AUG-P0 (panel A) and recEAV(opt)AUG-P0 (panel D). It is important to note that most of these plaques (>70%) had an average diameter of about 1.5 mm. However, this heterogeneous plaque phenotype was no longer observed after cell passage 15 (see panels B and E). At this stage, the plaque phenotype had become identical to that of the recombinant viruses with a wild-type leader sequence. The differences observed in plaque morphology and size prompted us to analyze further the genotype of the virus found in each type of plaque. To this end, total cellular RNA was extracted from individual plaques and used to amplify the leader region by RT-PCR. The PCR products were then sequenced. The results showed that the small plaques were produced by the mutant viruses whereas the medium-size and large plaques contained viruses in which the ILO translation start site had reverted to the wild-type sequence. These results indicate that restoration of the wild-type genotype had occurred already early during propagation of the mutant viruses and correlated with the observation that plaques of both sizes appeared with both virus mutants following cell transfection.",

            "text": "An intraleader ORF occurs in various EAV isolates. Because all genomic and subgenomic viral mRNAs in EAV-infected cells carry the ILO as a consequence of the particular viral replication strategy, a putative role in the EAV life cycle has been suggested [10] . Here we show that the EAV IL peptide is expressed in an in vitro cell-free translation system programmed with a synthetic mRNA7. Hence, we were quite surprized not being able to detect the EAV IL peptide in infected cells despite the mRNA7 abundance, neither by RIPA nor by Western blotting or immunofluoresence assay. This negative result can be explained in a number of ways. First, the IL peptide might simply not be produced during virus replication or be synthesized in very low amounts. Second, the folding of the IL peptide in a reticulocyte lysate may be different from that in virusinfected cells and may hence interfere with its detec-tion. Third, the IL peptide might be rapidly degraded in cells, which would be consistent with our inability to detect the protein by expression from the plasmid using the vaccinia virus vTF7-3 expression system, while synthesis of N protein from this plasmid was clearly observed (data not shown). Bi-and multicistronic mRNAs occur-though rarely-in normal eukaryotic cells [22] but they appear more frequently among viral mRNAs. Expression of the different genes is regulated by particular sequence conditions. Unless driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), the expression of a downstream ORF is generally inefficient. Accordingly, the in vitro expression of N protein was reduced when the EAV ILO initiation codon was functional, suggestive of a leaky scanning mechanism and consistent with the reported IRES-independent mechanism of translation of EAV mRNAs [7] . The significance, however, of such an attenuating effect of the ILO on the expression of all EAV genes is as yet hard to understand. Also for the related coronaviruses, which are generally devoid of an intraleader ORF, short ILO's have been described [11, 12] but their translation products have never been detected.",

When we blocked the At 4 days pi, the overlay was removed and the monolayers were fixed and stained with 0.9% violet crystal in 25% formaldehyde and 5% ethanol expression of the ILO, the mutant virus was able to produce infectious virions, consistent with an earlier study [23] showing EAV infectivity to be maintained after disruption of the intraleader AUG codon. However, unlike this study, modulating the ILO translation efficiency, either positively or negatively, by mutation of the AUG codon or of its context sequence, significantly affected viral characteristics. Mutations that had been confirmed in vitro to either block or enhance the expression of the ILO both resulted in viruses that exhibited delayed growth kinetics, reduced virus yields and smaller plaque size. These mutations appeared to be rapidly restored during serial passages of the viruses. Already during the first cycle a significant fraction of both mutant viruses had reverted to the wild-type phenotype and this effect became progressively complete following subsequent rounds of infection. Phenotypic restoration indeed correlated with genetic correction of the mutations as demonstrated by sequencing.",

Either the peptide has no function at all or, though not essential, it does play some subtle role. In the latter case one might envision that a certain, delicate level of the peptide is required for optimal replication. The amount of peptide synthesized would be regulated precisely by the particular sequence context of the initiating AUG. This context would understandably be suboptimal as the efficient expression of the ILO would, through its negative effect on downstream ORFs, be at the unfavorable expense of the synthesis of all other viral proteins. The rapid repair of the mutations that we introduced in and around the AUG sequence would also be consistent with the requirement for a dosed translation of the ILO. What functions the translation product would serve remains as yet unknown. In the alternative interpretation, the IL peptide per se is irrelevant. In that case, it must be the nucleotide sequence at and around the AUG that is of importance.",

            "text": "It has been reported that a 68 nt sequence within the antileader sequence of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), another arterivirus, constitutes the specific binding site of four cellular proteins [24] . Cellular proteins appeared to bind to similar regions in the antileader of other arteriviruses including EAV, an observation that we recently confirmed [25] . In addition, we also observed cellular proteins to bind to the EAV leader RNA positive strand and showed that nt 140-206 are not necessary for this binding. Hence, in addition to the base pairing in the vicinity of the leader TRS required for viral transcription, other key functions important in the EAV life cycle appear to reside in the 5\u00a2 region of the leader sequence, and the ILO sequence might be one of these. Whether the cellular proteins bind to the ILO, and more particularly to the region carrying the AUG sequence, has yet to be determined. As was done for the 68 nt sequence of SHFV to which cellular protein binds [24] , we [10] and others [6] predicted secondary structures in the 5\u00a2 genomic region of several EAV isolates. It appears that the ILO AUG codon occurs in a stem-loop structure, base pairing with nucleotides at positions 38-40. By using the Mfold version 3.1 software of Zuker et al. [26] to predict the secondary structures, the G-to-T mutation introduced in the EAV leader sequence leads to the formation of a small internal loop and a small bulge downstream and in front of the mutation site, respectively. However, the T-to-A mutation leads to the formation of a small internal loop at the mutation site. Whether these secondary structures in the vicinity of the ILO AUG play a role in interactions between the viral RNA and cellular proteins remain to be investigated.",

Their sequences are important for recognition by viral and host cell proteins that mediate these processes. In nidovirus replication, the 3\u00a2-terminal sequences of the minus strand RNAs, i.e. the sequences complementary to the leader, direct the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. It is thus quite plausible that strong selective pressures exist to maintain these sequences. The precision with which the G-to-T mutation in the ILO AUG and the T-to-A mutation at position -3 were repaired supports this view, as does the apparent instability of the reported A-to-G mutation in the AUG [23] . The latter mutation had an identical effect (i.e. complete inhibition) on the expression of the ILO as had our G-to-T mutation. Yet, in contrast to our results, viral replication efficiency nor plaque size were significantly affected. We therefore favor the idea that the IL peptide has no functional significance but that it is the precise nucleotide sequence that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.",
