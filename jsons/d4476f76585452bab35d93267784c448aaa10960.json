Although approximately 16,000 people live on four of the larger islands, 97% of the islands are park land protected from human activity. The Galapagos are home to at least 6,000 species of animals and plants, more than half of which are found nowhere else on the Earth. The native mammalian species are the Galapagos sea lion, fur seal, rice rat, and Galapagos red and hoary bats. Transient maritime visits have occurred since the 1500s, and the Galapagos were formally colonized by Ecuador in 1832. Accompanying these human activities was the introduction of nonnative species, either as intentional agricultural introductions or as incidental passengers on boats and planes. Invasive species also arrived naturally on ocean and wind currents. These introduced species are believed to be the greatest threat to the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos via predation, competition, infectious diseases, and habitat destruction. 1 The Galapagos National Park Service (SPNG) oversees conservation in the Galapagos National Park and Galapagos Marine Reserve. An inspection and quarantine system (SICGAL) was established in 1998 to limit immigration and prevent the introduction and spread of exotic and invasive species to and between the islands. This includes a prohibition against animal movement and against the use of canine and feline vaccines. Eradication of nonnative feral goats, pigs, donkeys, cattle, poultry, cats, and dogs has periodically involved hunting and poisoning. [2] [3] [4] [5] In 2004, the SPNG launched a trial program to control dogs and cats by neutering. In May 2004, volunteers from the United States a and the islands conducted a neutering campaign on Isabela Island supervised by the SPNG, SICGAL, and the municipal Control and Management of Introduced Species committee (CIMEI) for the island.

The island has the greatest diversity of native animal species and is best known for its giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and Darwin finches. In addition to a human population of 1,500, the island is colonized by many invasive species, including cats and dogs. Of particular concern is the hunting of endangered iguanas by free-roaming dogs and of birds by cats. 6, 7 Most of the residents inhabit the coastal fishing village of Puerto Villamil, and a smaller number live on farms in the highlands. In Puerto Villamil, the dogs freely roam in the village and on the beaches where the iguanas live. Most dogs are friendly and associate with a family residence where they return at night. Some cats also appear to associate with a home or business, whereas others are stray or feral. Most dogs and cats live outdoors, and it is unusual for them to be confined in any way. Pets are primarily fed uncooked fish scraps or leftovers from family meals, and parasiticides developed for human and food animal use are provided to almost half of the dogs. 2 No animals receive heartworm prophylaxis.

The dogs and cats were exposed to several common viruses, including CPV, FPV, CDV, CAV, CPiV, FCV, and FHV. None of the tested animals was exposed to enteric coronaviruses or infected with FeLV or FIV. Two thirds of the dogs were seropositive for CAV. The CAV-1 antibody titer exceeded or equaled the CAV-2 antibody titer in all but 1 dog, suggesting that CAV-1 was the predominant serotype and that the detection of CAV-2 reactivity may have been because of nonspecific cross-reactivity, which is common for CAV. None of the viruses endemic in the dogs and cats on Isabela infects human beings, reptiles, or birds. Marine mammals are susceptible to some strains of CDV and FCV, although host range and transmission modes are poorly understood. 9-11 CDV and FCV are highly contagious and are spread by virus shed in airborne droplets, in fecal material, or by direct contact with infected animals or fomites. The dogs and cats in Puerto Villamil frequently visit the beaches, and so there is potential for indirect contact with the beach-dwelling Galapagos sea lions. However, during a distemper outbreak in dogs in 2001, serological tests of sea lions in the area showed no evidence of exposure to CDV. 2, 12 Parvoviral exposure in particular appeared to be ubiquitous within the dog and cat populations. Several puppies and adult dogs were observed with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis during the May 2004 sample collection period, but on-site testing of feces for parvovirus antigen or collection of paired acute and convalescent serum samples for seroconversion was not possible. Because most of the dogs and cats presented for neutering appeared healthy and vaccination is prohibited, the high parvovirus antibody prevalence suggests that these animals were either subclinically infected or had recovered from infection at the time of testing. Parvoviruses are not known to affect the native species found in the Galapagos, but these viruses undergo rapid evolution and have occasionally increased their host range to new species, as evidenced by the jump from cats to dogs in the late 1970s. 13, 14 Distemper outbreaks have occasionally occurred in the Galapagos. One outbreak in 2001 originated on the island of Santa Cruz and killed more than 300 dogs. 2,12 A month later, dogs began to die of distemper on Isabela. Approximately 300 dogs died in the Isabela outbreak, leaving only 5 or 6 dogs remaining in Puerto Villamil and approximately 30 dogs on the highland farms or as strays. On both islands, the source of the infection was believed to be illegally introduced dogs. Authorities responded to the outbreak by quarantining healthy dogs indoors, culling sick dogs, and burning carcasses. Humans traveling from the mainland and between islands were treated with disinfectant in an attempt to prevent reintroductions of the virus. A door-to-door census conducted on Isabela 15 months after the 2001 distemper outbreak revealed that the dog population had rebounded to 197. 2, 12 At the time of the neutering campaign in May 2004, a small portion of the dogs had CDV antibodies, but the antibody titers were low compared with those usually observed in vaccinated dogs or dogs recovering from infection. The presence of antibodies may be because of decreased specificity of the assay when using plasma (versus serum), because of cross-reactivity with a related virus, or because of previous exposure to CDV. The small number of antibody-positive dogs, coupled with low antibody titers and prohibition of vaccination, suggests that most of the canine population on Isabela Island is susceptible to distemper and a new epidemic could occur. The rapid recovery of the canine population so soon after its decimation by distemper illustrates the difficulty of controlling invasive species in the absence of ongoing programs. A similar phenomenon occurred after an eradication program on Isabela in 1981 in which the dog population was reduced from an estimated 300-500 members to o100 by means of poisoning. 5 After the initial precipitous decline of the population because of the culling, it recovered to its original baseline by the 2001 distemper outbreak, after which it again recovered by the time of the neutering campaign in 2004.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1427, "end": 1429, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1432, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2323, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3206, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3209, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4233, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Dogs and cats that live outdoors in tropical climates are at increased risk for diseases transmitted by biting insects. Although many species may be incidentally infected with D. immitis, canids are considered to be the true natural reservoir. One third of the dogs in the current study were infected with D. immitis, indicating that this parasite is endemic in the dog population of Isabela and that the local mosquito population is capable of transmitting infective larvae. Of the heartworm-infected dogs, two thirds also had evidence of exposure to W. pipiens, an endosymbiont found in a variety of human and animal filarial parasites and now believed to play an important role in the pathology of filarial diseases. 15, 16 Although it is believed that 100% of heartworms carry W. pipiens, it was not detected in all heartworminfected dogs. This may be because of the use of serum rather than whole blood in the PCR assay, because microfilaria, a rich source of W. pipiens, are not present in serum. Detection of W. pipiens in the circulation is most common during heartworm larval molting and at the time of heartworm death. In addition to the dogs, 1 cat had evidence of exposure to D. immitis. A study in the early 1980s made reference to finding D. immitis in dogs on Isabela, but the prevalence of infection was not reported. 5 This same study reported that 77% of dogs on Floreana Island had D. immitis microfilaria and 18% of cats had serum antibodies against D. immitis. To the authors' knowledge, there are no other reports on the prevalence of D. immitis infection in dogs and cats in the Galapagos or mainland Ecuador. Only a few of the 13 South American countries have reported heartworm infections in dogs, including Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, and the prevalence ranges from 2% in Brazil to 5% in Colombia. 17 Feline heartworm infection is seldom reported in South America but has been documented in Brazil. 17 Infection with Borrelia spp., Babesia spp., and the Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. group of tick-transmitted diseases is endemic in South American dogs.

Three different species of Bartonella were identified in dogs, whereas cats carried 2 species. These agents are often transmitted by fleas, which are common in the Galapagos. The prevalence rates of B. henselae and B. clarridgeaie infections are similar to those of high flea risk areas in the United States. 31, 32 Among the Bartonella spp. observed, only cats infected with B. henselae are considered to have significant zoonotic risk to immunecompetent humans (cat scratch disease). [33] [34] [35] Nonvector-borne infections in dogs and cats with zoonotic potential include toxoplasmosis and leptospirosis. A majority of cats had evidence of exposure to T. gondii. This infection is acquired by cats from eating infected prey, from being fed undercooked contaminated meat, transplacentally, or by ingestion of sporulated oocysts. [36] [37] [38] T. gondii has an extremely broad host range and can be spread to humans and animals by ingestion of contaminated cat feces, undercooked meat, or infected cats. Toxoplasmosis poses a significant threat to the health of unborn children if the mother is first exposed during pregnancy. Toxoplasmosis has also been associated with disease outbreaks in a number of wildlife species, recently among otters in the coastal waters of California. 39 The prevalence rate for T. gondii in the Galapagos cats is similar to that in cats in other countries. 32, 40, 41 Canine leptospirosis is endemic in South America, where the seroprevalence ranges from 11 to 41% in dogs. 42, 43 Infected dogs serve as reservoirs for infection of humans and wildlife species such as sea lions. None of the dogs on Isabela Island was seropositive for L. interrogans serovars canicola, icterohemorrhagiae, and grippotyphosa, which are the most commonly reported serovars in South American dogs. 42, 43 In conclusion, despite their seclusion from the rest of the world, the cats and dogs of Isabela are exposed to many of the same pathogens found in South America and worldwide. This is most likely owing to persistence of endemic infections that were present before the strict control of interisland animal movements. Infections may also be introduced by the illegal smuggling of infected animals or by the adventitious contamination of people and supplies arriving by air or boat. Some of the infections posed a risk to humans or to native wildlife, but most were specific to dogs and cats. Because of the relatively small number of samples used in this study, particularly from cats, failure to identify specific pathogens should not be interpreted as evidence against their presence.
