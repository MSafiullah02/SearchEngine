Infectious diseases are the major cause of illness and death for any given population [2,3]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza and Poliomyelitis are examples of an infectious disease [3,4]. While globally the incidence of the infectious disease varies greatly between countries, in the 21st century, the main incidences are hand-foot-mouth disease, Hepatitis B, and Tuberculosis [3]. These diseases have a significant impact on the global health and economies [5]. Despite numerous valuable achievements regarding the procedures for preventing and controlling of various diseases, infectious diseases remain a massive threat to a population\u2019s well-being [6]. Aspects such as the increasing in antimicrobial resistance, increase in population and environmental changes are important in an infectious disease transmission [7]. Of 57 million mortality reported per year throughout the world, 14.9 million were related to infectious diseases; which represent more than 25% of the overall deaths [3].",

Fuzzy methods deal with the classes whose boundaries are unclear and elusive [18]. Fuzzy logic concepts were introduced in 1965 [10]. The medical field was one of the first fields in which fuzzy theory was implemented [19]. Fuzzy classes are given a degree of membership that is intermediary between 0 and 1 [18].",

Kosko has introduced FCM in 1986. FCM is usually used to demonstrate the cause and effect relationship between the different concepts in a given system. FCMs are used in numerous fields such as in engineering, error detection and medicine [36,37]. In this regard, Mei et al. has applied FCM to describe how factors such as people\u2019s emotions and cognition functions influence each other to create epidemic infection [38]. FCM was also used by the Mago et al. research to develop the required knowledge-based structure used for recognizing the specific causes and the symptoms of meningitis disease in children. This system can be implemented as a dependable instrument in supporting the physician\u2019s to better their decision making processes [39].",

This technique can also deliver the required scientific confirmation which will help us decide the amount of vaccine treatment, its efficiency, its financial costs and its pattern of contact in any given population [6,45,46]. It has been shown that the fuzzy based techniques have an essential part in the determination of infectious disease outbreaks. As an example for that, we have the HIV outbreaks, these techniques can identify at what time a viral transmission has occurred, its outbreak stage and the sexual behavior pattern of the specific population in which a disease is spreading. Moreover, the infectious diseases annihilation and elimination techniques dictate that the transmission process itself has to be the target not the disease. Regard this, the data sources are typically scattered and the collective effect of the numerous control techniques are complex and are dependent on the rate of transmission [47].",

Methods that correlate spatial and social network data analysis are unusual but have the capacity to promote the determination of a spreading progress of an infectious disease [57]. Or we can say, the deployment of a unified spatial and social network structure to define the spreading of an infectious pathogens in a given populace will allow insights into both the understanding to the disease method of distribution and the possible process associated with the observed patterns. Since there are various studies regarding social media information analysis, we recommend the use of this dataset for the prediction of an infectious disease epidemic.",

Thus, it is recommended that additional SLR papers should be carried out to go through the other noticeable databases.

In conclusion, only the English language publications were included, therefore future studies could be expanded to incorporate relevant papers which are published in other languages.",
