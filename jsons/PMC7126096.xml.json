So too for front line health care practitioners (HCPs) who face disproportionate risks of serious morbidity and mortality from infection (Ruderman et al., 2006), leading us to question the boundaries of their duty to care. Ever since SARS when Singer et al. (2003) emphasized that the nature of HCPs' duty to care is historically and philosophically contested, it has remained a polarizing issue.",

Broadly speaking, the positions on the extent of an HCPs duty to care has, on the whole, moved from the more absolute and categorical to a more nuanced position. The mid-19th century American Medical Association Code of Ethics was among the first to formally introduce the concept of a physician's duty to care and did so in near-absolute terms by stating that, \u201c[w]hen pestilence prevails, it is [physicians'] duty to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives\u201d (Baker, Caplan, Emanuel, & Latham, 1999, p. 40). Today, however, while there is continued acceptance of a duty to care on behalf of HCPs, few use as strong of language as does the 1847 Code. Indeed, there has been a consistent recognition that considerations of personal welfare may indeed impose limits on HCPs' duty to care. As Norman Daniels puts it, we find the 1847 AMA Code as being \u201ctoo extreme\u201d and, he argues, \u201cthat there are some limits, however vaguely specified, to the risks physicians have agreed to face\u201d (Daniels, 1991, p. 38).",

Therefore, the pertinent question regarding the duty to care shifts from \u201cwhether or not\u201d to one of \u201cwhen and to what extent\u201d (Clark, 2005a). Thus, to increase understanding of this issue, we must go beyond assessing (that is, making a case for) whether a duty to care exists during disasters, but rather focus our theoretical, empirical, and policy efforts on further bolstering our understanding of the scope and limits of a duty to care. Some attempts have been made in this direction: on an empirical basis (Balicer, Omer, Barnett, & Everly, 2006; Bensimon, Tracy, Bernstein, Shaul, & Upshur, 2007; Draper et al., 2008; Ehrenstein, Hanses, & Salzberger, 2006; Seale, Leask, Po, & MacIntyre, 2009); based on legal jurisprudence (Davies & Zlotnik-Shaul, 2009; Walker, 2002); on a conceptual basis (Clark, 2005b); or on a philosophical account (Ruderman et al., 2006; van der Weijden, Bredenoord, & van Delden, 2010). Policy-makers themselves have been spurred by the practical challenges caused by the lack of guidelines regarding duties and obligations during pandemics. Many regulatory bodies too have taken heart, largely in response to the distress this caused during SARS, by addressing the need to define what the duty to care means in practice, especially during disasters or public health emergencies.",

In a previous study conducted by our research team, we sought to describe lay and expert views on the duty to care in the aftermath of SARS (Bensimon et al., 2007). As part of its research platform, which included different forms of stakeholder engagement and national telephone surveys, the Canadian Program of Research on Ethics in a Pandemic (CanPREP) built on this study by conducting three Townhall meetings across Canada in order to probe participants' views about ethical issues related to pandemic influenza, including issues surrounding the duty to care. A related goal was to enhance the legitimacy of the substantive and procedural values proposed in the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics' seminal report on ethics during a pandemic, which had been developed without public input (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Pandemic Influenza Working Group, 2005). Public engagement on matters of practice and policy, we believe, lends inherent authenticity to the burgeoning policy area and newly-developing standards of practice pertaining to the duty to care during disasters. In this paper, we present findings from the Townhall discussions on the duty to care with the view of further bolstering our empirical understanding of its scope and limits.",

Rather, it was a starting point\u2014i.e. first there is personal choice, which is then bound by legitimate limits. On that basis, it was thought to be wholly legitimate to expect HCPs to care during pandemics despite the inherent risk to\u2014and in virtue of their presumed consent to risk by\u2014HCPs. A crucial caveat here is that this expectation applies to those who have taken an oath to care, i.e. physicians.

This finding has important implications for policy-makers and pandemic planners: while it is now widely accepted that HCPs are deemed a priority group for prophylaxis (Gardam et al., 2007; Moghadas, 2010; World Health Organization, 2008), prioritizing access to treatment based on social value, at least for HCPs, has been equally widely debated or altogether discounted in policy circles.

For example, Bensimon et al.

In contrast, however, Civaner and Arda (2008) consider whether the duty to care might be circumscribed by contextual constraints.

Another study found that absenteeism may be as high as 85% at any point during a pandemic, with potential absence particularly concentrated amongst nursing and ancillary workers (Damery et al., 2009). While little data to our knowledge exist reporting absenteeism rates during recent communicable disease outbreaks, the Pan American Health Organization (2009) has remarked that absenteeism among health care workers was as high as 30% in some cases during the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2009) found that, in some regions of Argentina, as many as 40% of health care workers did not go to work during the peak of the pandemic and, in New Zealand, hospital staff absenteeism created temporary stresses on hospitals.

Moreover, much of the duty to care literature discusses the relationship between HCPs' duty and the risks they assume by entering the profession. Indeed, some may suggest that a strict duty to care exists for HCPs during infectious disease outbreaks as these risks are simply part of the job and were assumed by the HCP when he or she entered the profession. However, what is unclear is exactly what risks are assumed by HCPs in their respective professions and clinical responsibilities, and, for trainees, what and how such risks are described. Such questions are important to explore, as answers to these questions could reveal whether or not HCPs are being adequately informed of the risks that may exist in their profession, and what the limits to their duty might be in relation to these risks.

Our analysis contributes a better understanding of the constitutive nature of the duty to care, defined in part by taking account of public views. Public views allow us to reflect upon how professional obligations align with public opinion, perhaps contributing to something similar to Rawls's (1999) process of reflective equilibrium to negotiate decisions. This broadened understanding can further inform the articulation of acceptable norms of the duty to care and policy development efforts.
