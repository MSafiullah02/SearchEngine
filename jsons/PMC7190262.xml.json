The majority of iron transfer to the fetus occurs in the third trimester, placing preterm infants at increased risk for iron deficiency.4 Other populations, such as small-for-gestational-age infants and infants of diabetic mothers, have a significant risk of iron insufficiency.5,6 There is increasing awareness that iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can have negative health and neurodevelopmental effects.7\u20139 Previous studies have demonstrated that reticulocyte hemoglobin (retHE) is a reliable and sensitive measure of iron status,10\u201313 and is the recommended screening test from the American Academy of Pediatrics.14 Recent animal studies have shown it to be the most sensitive hematological marker of brain iron deficiency.15 Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine supplementation in preterm infants but delays supplementation until 4 months for breastfed term infants.14 Anemia is a late finding in iron deficiency, and identification of an early marker of low iron status could lead to earlier treatment and optimization of supplementation. We aimed to increase the rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patient iron sufficiency by instituting a guideline focused on retHE-driven initiation and titration of iron supplementation.",

The team consisted of neonatologists, a pediatric gastroenterologist, a neonatal nurse practitioner, and registered dietitians. Given our complex and heterogeneous patient population with many inflammatory conditions, guideline development, testing, and implementation included consideration of barriers to applying other measures of iron deficiency, such as ferritin. NICU clinicians and relevant departments reviewed the guideline to provide comments and suggestions, including representatives from Laboratory Medicine and then approved by a multidisciplinary leadership committee. The final screening protocol was tested on a small scale and then disseminated to all NICU care providers and implemented on 1 July 2017. Key practice changes under the new guideline included (1) establishment of recommendation for routine measurement of retHE among patients receiving full feeds; (2) recommended initiation of standard iron doses for eligible patients; (3) standardized timing of reassessment of retHE during admission; and (4) standard advancement of iron supplementation in response to low retHE. Absolute contraindications to inclusion were patients not receiving enteral feeding.

Starting in May 2017, we piloted the guideline with the on-service care team. We used ongoing analysis of data regarding retHE measurements and staff feedback to develop interventions for further tests of change and refine the guideline. After the guideline was fully tested under various conditions and refined, we implemented the following: (1) daily education during patient care rounds in July 2017; (2) broad circulation of an email educational summary with the major goals and recommendations of the guideline to faculty, fellows and nurses in September 2017; (3) sharing of interval results at faculty meetings in October 2017 and January 2018; and (4) providing of patient-specific reminders for February 2018.

Consistent with previous cohorts, in our heterogeneous NICU population, there was a strong correlation between retHE values and signs of anemia, such as elevated reticulocyte count, as well as lower hemoglobin and MCV.10,12,13,19,21\u201323 We found that implementation of an iron supplementation guideline providing evidence-based recommendations for the measurement of retHE and supplementation of iron was followed by an increase of >2-fold in the percentage of patients discharged with retHE within the normal range. Our guideline successfully and significantly increased the measurement of retHE and subsequently led to an increased proportion of iron sufficient patients being discharged from the NICU. Importantly, there were no cases of excessive iron among our study cohort.",

Because we collected limited covariate data, we were unable to assess whether differences in the pre- and post-guideline groups, such as the severity of illness, could have explained the level of guideline adherence. Though we only achieved a 39% percentage of eligible patients with a normal range of retHE values, it may be that the achievable rate of iron sufficiency is relatively low in our highly complex patient population due to severity of illness, frequent needs for periods of parenteral nutrition, and ongoing phlebotomy. We note that many patients persisted in having low retHE values despite being on maximum recommended iron supplementation, pointing to an underlying etiology for iron deficiency not remedied by supplementation alone. Given the high incidence of inflammatory conditions, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia and short bowel syndrome, among the subset of patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency, those individuals may have increased hepcidin levels leading to iron trapping within macrophages.24,25 Although most birth hospitals were routinely practicing delayed cord clamping, we were unable to compare rates of delayed cord clamping practice pre and post-guideline, which could affect the initial iron status of infants. Also, many patients were on full enteral feeds or standard iron supplementation for limited periods before discharge, which may lead to a delay in iron sufficiency; if retHE levels were followed after NICU discharge, the rate of iron sufficiency might be even higher than measured in our study. With this in mind, the iron status of our NICU patients at discharge, as measured by retHE, was communicated to primary care pediatricians to improve post-discharge treatment and monitoring of iron deficiency. Further work focused on decreasing the percentage of patients with iron deficiency at the time of discharge is an important area of investigation.",
