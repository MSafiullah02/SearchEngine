            "text": "The process of efferocytosis involves the recruitment of phagocytic cells and the recognition, phagocytosis, and digestion of ACs. In these processes, signaling molecules could be divided into four types: find-me, eat-me, bridging, and don\u2019t eat-me signals (Figure 1\n). First, the find-me signals are exhibited in different forms, including nucleotides, proteins, lipids, and lipid products.5 The best known types are the nucleotides, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP). Released by ACs through pannexin 1, ATP/UTP can act as short-range chemoattractants to promote purinoreceptor-2-dependent recruitment of phagocytes.6 Other important contributors are proteins, such as fractalkine (CX3CL1), which is secreted from apoptotic lymphocytes and binds to its receptor (CX3CR1) on the surface of phagocytes to attract macrophages via caspase- and Bcl-2-regulated signals.7 In addition, the lipid mediator, lysophosphatidylcholine, and the lipid product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), contribute to the recruitment of macrophages and the inhibition of necrosis.8 Particularly, the lysophosphatidylcholine and G protein-coupled receptor G2A system can attract phagocytes to ACs and prevent autoimmunity in a \u201ckeep calm\u201d mechanism.9 Second, eat-me signals are mainly composed of molecules on the surface of ACs, of which phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is the most well-researched molecule. Eat-me signals also consist of modified molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 3 and CD31. Normally, PtdSer is confined to the inner surface of the plasma membrane by the action of flippases that translocate PtdSer from the outer leaflet. When cells undergo apoptosis, PtdSer translocates to the cell surface due to the activation of scramblases and the inactivation of flippases.10 Later, the PtdSers on ACs are attached by PtdSer receptors on phagocytes, including T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 4 (TIM4) and TIM1, stabilins, and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1. ACs are engulfed and progress to the next stage. Third, bridging molecules are able to bind to both the ACs and the phagocytes with their receptor-binding domains. For instance, the molecules associated with PtdSer include growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), protein S (PROS1), and milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8),5\n,\n11 as well as the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptors and the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins.12 Specifically, MFG-E8 acts as a bridge linking ACs and macrophages via PtdSer and the \u03b1\u03b2/\u03b2 integrins to facilitate the tethering step, and then triggers a series of downstream signals to clear ACs.3\n,\n6 Fourth, don\u2019t eat-me signals usually exist on non-ACs, which prevents viable cells from being cleared by phagocytes. The best known don\u2019t eat-me signal is CD47. Although CD47 can protect normal cells, it renders malignant cells resistant to efferocytosis and promotes tumor progression, suggesting its contradictory role in efferocytosis.",

            "text": "In conclusion, when apoptosis occurs, dying cells announce their presence to nearby phagocytes with find-me signals and then recruit motile phagocytes to the place of death. Meanwhile, ACs mark their outer leaflets with eat-me signals to allow themselves to be recognized by phagocytes. Eat-me signals are usually retained on the inner leaflets of the plasma membrane of healthy cells. Subsequently, phagocytes upregulate the corresponding cell surface receptors and bridging molecules to complete direct and indirect binding between the ACs and phagocytes.13 After combination, the Crk II/Elmo-Dock180-Rac pathway is activated to promote cytoskeletal reorganization of phagocytes, leading to corpse internalization.14\n,\n15 As a consequence (Figure 1), ACs are decomposed within the phagocytic cells by phagolysosomes. After digestion within the phagolysosome, cytokines are released, which further affects disease development (for details about molecules, see the reviews by Morioka et al.3 and by Gheibi Hayat et al.5). Since efferocytosis involves the signals and corresponding cytokines mentioned above, proper regulation of the signals may enhance AC clearance, and drugs targeting special molecules may provide novel approaches to treat disorders. However, whether the effect of intact or impaired efferocytosis is beneficial for the body depends on the diseases, which is discussed as follows.",

            "text": "When exposed to oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs), there is a reduction of nitric oxide bioavailability, leading to endothelial activation and monocyte chemotaxis. This process then causes an accumulation of oxLDLs and differentiated macrophages, which generate an inflammatory stimulus within the subendothelial layer of arteries. Subsequently, excessive cholesterol accumulation induces transformation of lipid-laden phagocytes into foam cells, which eventually undergo apoptosis and necroptosis.16\n,\n17 Later, dying cells express eat-me molecules on their surface, such as calreticulin18 and PtdSer. These molecules interact with the receptors (e.g., integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, MERTK, transglutaminase 2, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [LRP1], and scavenger receptor B) on phagocytes via bridging molecules, resulting in the activation of enzymes involved in phagolysosomal degradation and efferocytosis during early lesion formation.19, 20, 21, 22 Efferocytosis also limits the progression of atherosclerosis via indirectly inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory mediators, and directly enhancing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant responses.23\n,\n24 Although efferocytosis functions in early stages of atherosclerosis, its capabilities begin to wane in advanced plaques, and the necrotic core occurs after overproduction of secondarily necrotic cells.25 In advanced plaques, the expressions of eat-me molecules and bridging molecules are decreased. However, increased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) induces expression of the don\u2019t eat-me molecule CD47 via nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), ultimately rendering vascular cells resistant to efferocytosis.26 Moreover, Doran et al.12 drew a comprehensive and detailed relationship between advanced plaques and defective efferocytosis.",

Ait-Oufella et al.27 observed an accumulation of ACs and enhanced lesion development in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient female mice with MERTK deficiency after a high-fat diet. This is supported by Thorp et al.28 who found that mutation of the phagocytic MERTK receptor inhibits efferocytosis and accelerates the formation of necrotic plaques in Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mice. Other researchers have suggested that protease disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) mediates the proteolysis of MERTK. Furthermore, the cleaved extracellular fragment named soluble MER can bind to GAS6, and thus suppress efferocytosis.29 Third, LRP1 may impair efferocytosis via exposure of macrophages to oxLDLs, or degradation by epsin-mediated and ubiquitin-dependent internalization.30 The fourth mechanism is associated with arachidonic acid-derived 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE), which suppresses ACs internalization via Ras homolog gene family, member A activation.31 Finally, CD47 is upregulated in ACs and allows them to avoid recognition by phagocytes.12\n",

However, they differ from non-cancer diseases, as these macrophages are further polarized to a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype, followed by an increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in tumor progression.55 From this perspective, TAM receptor-directed therapies in preclinical studies and clinical trials may have anticancer effects (details can be found in tables 1 and 2 in the review by Myers et al.56). Although efferocytosis-related mechanisms describing internal relationships between tumor progression and efferocytosis are currently understudied, we review articles about several tumors with a high global burden, such as breast cancer, PCa, and leukemia to show the strong connection between these tumors and efferocytosis.",

Moreover, widespread cell death triggers efferocytosis-induced wound-healing cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), in the TME to further promote metastatic tumor progression.58\n,\n59 In this case, intact efferocytosis enhances tumor progression, while defective efferocytosis promotes tumor apoptosis and causes secondary necrosis, both of which are detrimental to the host. Likewise, Werfel et al.60 pointed out that in lapatinib-treated HER2+ mammary tumors in MMTV-Neu mice, efferocytosis cleared apoptotic tumor cells, while blockade of efferocytosis induced secondary necrosis of ACs. However, the combined inhibition of MERTK and indoleamine-2,3-dioxegenase (IDO1) blocked tumor metastasis and caused tumor regression in 60% of MMTV-Neu mice. These results suggest that apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells can exhibit their effects on tumors via efferocytosis and IDO1, respectively. Therefore, inhibition of MERTK and IDO1 produces an anti-tumor effect, which benefits the host.60\n,\n61\n",

Jones et al.62 identified an increased level of M2-like macrophages in vitro during efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells compared with the M1-like macrophages, with increased numbers of PC-3 PCa in vitro. Also, Soki et al.63 suggested that MFG-E8-mediated efferocytosis can induce polarization of PCa-associated macrophages through the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway. In regard to PCa with bone metastasis, macrophage-driven efferocytosis of PCa cells in vitro induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially CXCL5, and the proinflammatory environment fueled further cancer cell growth. This mechanism is also confirmed by Roca et al.,64 who found that there were increased CXCL5 serum levels and more active efferocytotic activities existing in patients with PCa bone metastasis. Since efferocytosis accelerates tumor development, research aiming at impairing efferocytosis may suppress tumor progression. For example, administration of Stat3 reduces skeletal metastatic tumor growth and decreases skeletal tumor size, and CXCL5-deficient mice inhibit tumor progression, providing a clue for designing additional successful therapies.62\n,\n64\n",

TAM receptors can also facilitate leukemic phenotypes by interacting with other oncogenic proteins such as fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), LCK/YES-related novel protein tyrosine kinase (LYN), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).65 In particular, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a Gas6-dependent cancer, and AXL/GAS6 expression predicts poor prognosis in AML.66, 67, 68 As an example, AXL is activated in the presence of GAS6 in AML cell lines. This activation triggers downstream signaling through the AKT/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, contributing to oncogenic transformation.66 Moreover, AXL physically interacts with proteins, such as FLT3, FGFR, and TYRO3, to accelerate tumor cell migration and invasion.69 In contrast, combined treatment with subtherapeutic doses of doxorubicin and an AXL inhibitor, BGB324, decreased tumor growth in an AML xenograft model. Targeting the TAM receptors and inhibiting the bone marrow microenvironment via impaired efferocytosis may be an effective treatment in leukemia.69\n",

Treg cells secrete IL-13 to stimulate IL-10 production in macrophages, and autocrine-paracrine signaling by IL-10 induced Vav1 in macrophages to activate Rac1 and improve AC engulfment. Additionally, Manega et al.31 found higher 12(S)-HETE serum levels and lower IL-10 levels in patients with coronary artery disease than in healthy individuals, but the 12(S)-HETE-mediated inflammatory effect can be counteracted by atorvastatin (0.1 \u03bcM). Therefore, IL-10 plays a role in the reduction of inflammation in atherosclerosis. Additionally, recent strategies of Treg cell enhancement or atorvastatin administration may benefit people with advanced plaques, although more studies and clinical trials are needed.",

TGF-\u03b2 is the most well-researched GF, which plays a role in anti-inflammation, similar to the role of IL-10 in efferocytosis, and how VEGF sometimes participates in resolving wound inflammation and improving angiogenesis.45 In studies, M2 macrophages are found to secrete IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 to enhance atherosclerosis regression. Two main signaling pathways, the Akt/mTORC/LXR pathway and the JAK/STAT6 pathway, are associated with M2 polarization.86\n,\n91 Similarly, TGF-\u03b2 has an anti-inflammatory function in lung diseases and wounds. For instance, PPAR\u03b3 activation can resolve lung inflammation and fibrosis, but inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 reversed these results by inhibiting efferocytosis and decreasing the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10.92 Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 signaling can induce alternative macrophage activation, and defective T\u03b2RII signaling downregulates interactions with other immune cells, such as T cells, by inhibiting M2 polarization. It is TGF-\u03b2 that results in attenuated anti-inflammation in the lung.93 Nevertheless, efferocytosis with increased TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 secretion increased Mycobacterium leprae survival in macrophage-1 cells from paucibacillary leprosy patients, and it contributed to the persistence and sustained infection of the mycobacterium.94 Taken together, TGF-\u03b2 contributes to macrophage polarization and inflammation attenuation in non-tumor diseases. However, as there is always an accompanying changed level of IL-10, whether this protection is derived from IL-10 or from TGF-\u03b2 alone remains unclear. Whether it is effective to treat diseases by inducing macrophage polarization through increasing TGF-\u03b2 levels also remains to be determined.",

CSF mainly includes granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage CSF (M-CSF), and erythropoietin (EPO). In some experiments, they have been observed in the process of efferocytosis. Since macrophages have been extensively used as a model for efferocytosis and polarization, Ivanov et al.96 revealed that mesothelial cells produce membrane-bound and secreted CSF1 to sustain peritoneal macrophage growth in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. Kawano et al.10 found that CSF treatments increased the percentage of CD62L senescent neutrophils in the spleen of null mice, to prevent mice from developing a lupus-like autoimmune disease. Other researchers observed that the delivery of recombinant GM-CSF to the alveolar space restored the efferocytotic capability of alveolar macrophages to protect against pneumonia. Lai et al.97 concluded that murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced by M-CSF can be further polarized into the M2 phenotype by baicalin, to have an anti-inflammatory effect.10\n,\n97, 98, 99 In addition, EPO is involved in this process. Luo et al.100 indicated that PPAR\u03b3 was significantly decreased in obese mice and EPO increased macrophage PPAR\u03b3 to promote efferocytosis in obese mice. Moreover, EPO seems more suitable than PPAR\u03b3 agonists in obesity-related inflammation regulation. The reason is that pre-adipocytes expressed EPOR, but EPO can downregulate PPAR\u03b3 expression and inhibit pre-adipocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo.101\n",

Long-term-activated DCs fail to effectively activate alloreactive IFN-\u03b3-responsive T cells, and they changed their profile toward a non-functional and tumor-promoting phenotype.105 In addition, in the last step of efferocytosis, Cunha et al.106 showed that tumor-associated macrophages with LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) displayed M2 characteristics and reduced secretion of IFN-\u03b3, which suppressed the anti-tumor response. TAM lacking LAP exhibited M1 characteristics and increased stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-dependent type I IFN production to promote IFN-\u03b3, resulting in anti-tumor responses. It was the impairment of LC3-associated phagocytosis in myeloid cells of the TME that had anti-tumor effects. Although their studies support a role for LAP, these components possibly function in another biological process that does not involve phagocytosis. Since LAP interference may \u201creprogram\u201d the function of tumor-related macrophages to facilitate the clearance of cancer cells without interfering with typical autophagy processes, targeting LAP-specific proteins may be a potential therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, one study utilizing TAM-IFN-\u03b3R1 reporter lines puts forward a rationale that PtdSer-targeting, anti-TAM receptor, and anti-PD-L1-based therapeutics will have great advantages.107\n",

            "text": "TNF was originally named for its ability to cause necrosis of tumor tissue, and there are two main types in the TNF family: TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2. TNF-\u03b1 is produced by activated monocytes or macrophages, and TNF-\u03b2 is mainly produced by activated T cells. The TNF family has a crucial role in regulating immune responses, killing target cells, and inducing apoptosis. We mainly review the function of released TNF in diseases, especially in tumors, to find potential therapeutic ways associated with efferocytosis. In atherosclerosis, mechanistic studies identify TNF-\u03b1 as a fundamental driver of impaired AC removal, accounting for the activation of NF-\u03baB and a compromised role of defective efferocytosis in vascular disease.26\n,\n79\n,\n86 However, the selective activation of cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) by JWH-133 and HU-308, with reduced levels of TNF-\u03b1 and oxLDL-induced ROS, improves efferocytosis of normal-cultured and oxLDL-loaded macrophages. This process promotes the stability of atherosclerotic plaques.108 The function of TNF-\u03b1 is similar in wound healing because the successful efferocytosis of ACs can suppress LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation and TNF-\u03b1 expression.84 However, there is a dual role of reduced TNF-\u03b1 in lung diseases. On the one hand, it was observed that the CD73-A2a axis in macrophages causes reduction of TNF-\u03b1, linking early inflammatory events to subsequent immune responses to ACs.109 On the other hand, the reduced inflammatory response by fluticasone plus ACs through reducing TNF-\u03b1, CCL3, and CCL5 can increase the risk for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in COPD patients.110 In a sense, reducing TNF-\u03b1 and suppressing inflammation is not always beneficial, and their effects vary among diseases.",

Different from the effect in atherosclerosis, genetic deletion of the CCL2 receptor in mice with \u03b21 integrin-deficient type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) reduced AEC efferocytosis and accelerated inflammation. This study indicates a necessary requirement for recruited monocytes/macrophages in limiting lung injury.116 However, COPD macrophages release high levels of chemokines, including CXCL8 and CCL2, to recruit inflammatory cells to the lungs, promoting disease progression.43 Nevertheless, fluticasone plus ACs reduced CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL1, leading to an increased risk for CAP in COPD patients with bacterial infection.110 Taken together with the result that the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2 improved efferocytosis in murine bacterial pneumonia to resolve acute lung inflammation, chemokines that attract inflammation cells have a dual function.117 It encouraged inflammatory responses to clear bacteria and prevented further injury to the lung, and it promoted tissue repair via enhanced efferocytosis. Alternatively, it induces inflammation and impairs efferocytosis, preventing effective clearance of excessive inflammatory cells. There is a dynamic balance of inflammatory response and a \u201cflexible\u201d effect of chemokines and efferocytosis. Therefore, whether the function of chemokines and efferocytosis is good or bad for the host varies depending upon various situations. In wound healing, responses of a number of CXC and CX3C chemokines temporarily recruit neutrophils to injured sites during the inflammatory phase, and they accelerate the clearance of necrotic neutrophils during the transition into the proliferative phase, supporting a positive role of chemokines in the wound.44\n",

Additionally, increasing IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2 and reducing IL-1\u03b2, Il-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 can slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Of note, some miRs participate in the early and later stages of atherosclerosis by modulating endothelial activation, monocyte chemotaxis, and by regulating foam cell accumulation and inflammatory responses, respectively. These miRs may represent potential molecular targets for anti-atherosclerotic therapy, though the selectivity of miR-based therapy delivery systems remains a major challenge in drug development (see figure 2 and table 1 in Tajbakhsh et al.75). The main function of intact and defective efferocytosis is similar in inflammation reduction and tissue repair in lung diseases. However, there may be an adverse effect in bacterial pneumonia because of the decreased inflammation, as a result of improved efferocytosis, and cannot clear infected cells, but CCL2 can enhance efferocytosis in murine pneumonia to promote lung repair, suggesting a dual function of efferocytosis in certain lung diseases.110\n,\n117 Moreover, there are various macrophages exhibiting functions in different lung diseases, but the role of efferocytosis is dependent on the situation. As for wounds, valid efferocytosis and its cytokines have a positive role in healing, similar to its function in atherosclerosis and lung diseases, but improving the rate of AC clearance is a key factor, as there is an inflammatory phase during the repair process several days after injury.47 In conclusion, apart from some opposite results in several conditions, efferocytosis has benefits to hosts with non-tumor conditions.",

Efferocytosis induces conversion of tumor-associated macrophage to the M2 phenotype, which inhibits the clearance of ACs and promotes the expression of CD47 to escape from recognition.58\n,\n125 Impairing efferocytosis to block the above mechanisms seems possible. Additionally, targeting the TAM receptors and inhibiting the bone marrow microenvironment may be useful in ameliorating leukemia.69 Nevertheless, inhibiting efferocytosis may not provide substantial benefits for the body because of the effects caused by secondary necrosis, but suppressing efferocytosis and necrosis via inhibition of MerTK and IDO1 may exhibit an anti-tumor effect without damage to the host in breast cancer patients.60\n,\n61 Furthermore, as cytokines can assist tumor progression, targeting IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and CXCL5 or enhancing IFN-\u03b3 and some chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9, CXCL10) may inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis. A combination of chemotherapy or radiotherapy may provide a novel therapeutic method for cancer treatment. The toxicity and efficacy of those drugs are under consideration. However, there is an interesting point related to efferocytosis and anticancer drugs. When anticancer drugs cause apoptosis-induced death of cancer cells, efferocytosis in TME is started, followed by excessive anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-\u03b2, prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], platelet-activating factor [PAF], and IL-10). This process leads a silent anti-tumor response by the immune system. Activated efferocytosis facilitates tumor progression, making the situation quite complicated. Drugs such as doxorubicin may promote the expression of eat-me signals on the surface of a tumor. Therefore, a serious reconsideration is expected on anticancer drugs and efferocytosis in treating tumors.5\n",

Second, how can one make full use of TAM receptors to mitigate illnesses, since TAM receptors have a crucial role in efferocytosis? Third, what methods can be used to polarize involved macrophages into the necessary phenotype to modulate anti-inflammation and the immune system? Fourth, what can be done to combine efferocytosis and chemotherapy to treat tumors without subjecting the host to any potential toxic effects?
