They are responsible for the fragrance, taste, and pigment of plants. 1 Terpenes are classified on the basis of organization and number of isoprene units it contains (see footnote 1). An isoprene unit is a building block of terpenes that is a gaseous hydrocarbon that contains the molecular formula C 5 H 8 (see footnote 1). Terpenes and terpenoids are terms that are often used interchangeably but the two terms have slight differences; terpenes are an arrangement of isoprene units that are naturally occurring, volatile, unsaturated 5-carbon cyclic compounds that give off a scent or a taste to defend itself from organisms that feed off of certain types of plants (see footnote 1). Terpenes have many functions in plants such as a thermoprotectant, signaling functions, and not limited to, pigments, flavoring, and solvents but also have various medicinal uses (Yang et al. 2012) .

With the rising malarial infections and drug resistance, terpenes have gained more attention towards it through antiplasmodial activity (Nogueira and Lopes 2011) . The interesting mechanism behind the terpene activity is that it binds to the hemin part of infected erythrocytes and kills the parasite just like the famous antimalarial drug chloroquine (Orjih et al. 1981; Kayembe et al. 2012) . Hemin is made of iron which is necessary for the plasmodium development in the erythrocytes. Though hemin breaking enzymes are not yet found in plasmodium, it could be one reason why hemin binding accounts for parasite lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 1984) . Another study suggests that drug-hemin complex binds to phospholipid layers thereby disrupting the respective membrane structure and causing cell lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 1984) . Moreover, it is also known that hemin can affect the carbohydrate metabolism of the parasites, which could lead to lysis of parasites (Rodriguez and Jungery 1986) . Thus, terpenes can be designed to be promising drugs for malaria. Different kinds of terpenes show different effects on the parasites.

This increased secretion in turn activates the opioid \u03bc-receptors.

In addition, studies also showed that cineole is capable of improving the health of bronchitis patients by reducing their cough (Fischer and Dethlefsen 2013) . This is in agreement with the fact that eucalyptus oil was used as an expectorant in Ayurvedic medicine. 20 It is also known that local Brazilians used the Eucalyptus leaves to treat several human diseases such as cancer (Mathias et al. 2012) . Further reports also suggest that eucalyptus oil has been involved in ancient Indian Ayurvedic and Greco-European medicine systems (see footnote 19).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 101, "text": "(Efferth et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1232, "text": "(Heinig et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1316, "text": "(Wu et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1439, "text": "17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1442, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1555, "text": "Sartorelli et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1792, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2069, "text": "(Sartorelli et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2308, "end": 2329, "text": "Moss and Oliver 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2460, "end": 2489, "text": "(Fischer and Dethlefsen 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2713, "end": 2734, "text": "(Mathias et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Uses in Folk Medicine"}, {"text": "Ayurveda is a popular medicine system which originated about 3000 years ago in India. The ayurvedic medicines are based on medicinal herbs, minerals, and metals (see footnote 16) along with diet regimes such as vegetarianism (Caldecott 2006) . This system of medicine has proven to cure chronic disorders that could not be treated by western medicine (Sharma et al. 2007) . Interestingly a lot of medicinal plants used by Ayurvedic practitioners owe their therapeutic property to their terpene contents. One good example is turmeric, a family of ginger which is regarded as \"Golden Goddess\" by medical practitioners (see footnote 18). 21 It has numerous therapeutic properties that includes anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many more (see footnote 18). 22 Recently, scientists discovered that most of the turmeric's properties are laid out by the yellow-colored terpene-curcumin (Kocaadam and \u015eanlier 2017) . Studies are now trying to create curcumin analogues to improve the effects and activity of natural curcumin (Kocaadam and \u015eanlier 2017) . Another popular example is clove which was used by both Ayurveda and TCM as a painkiller in dental cases. It was applied topically on cavities to relieve toothache and abdomen to treat digestive problems (Alqareer et al. 2006) . The essential oil of clove is mostly composed of eugenol, a bioactive terpene that is responsible for clove's aroma (Alqareer et al. 2006) . Eugenol by itself is said to enhance the blood circulation in the body and improve metabolism (see footnote 22). Thus, based on the above data we can conclude that various terpenes have been in use even before their discoveries by modern science, due to their amazing medicinal properties. A schematic summary of different terpenes and their medicinal uses, that we discussed, is provided below in Fig. 15 .1.
