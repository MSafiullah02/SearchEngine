            "text": "Preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks can be greatly enhanced by the availability of models that can predict the transmission of pathogens and assess the potential effectiveness of control measures1,2. The reliability of such models depends upon elucidation of key epidemiologic parameters for the disease, as well as a strong understanding of the transmission dynamics in susceptible populations and the effect of intervention strategies on preventing disease spread3. A variety of models have been developed in recent years to identify critical targets for control efforts, predict impacts, and estimate resource requirements for specific outbreak scenarios for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)4. However, it is critical that mathematical models applied to predict disease spread and impact are built upon parameters that are reliable and representative for the specific host-pathogen combination2. In addition, models used to inform disease control planning efforts need to be able to adequately represent the complexity of the livestock production systems involved and the often inter-linked and overlapping disease control strategies likely to be deployed. Similarly, thorough understanding of the biological relevance of modeled parameters is needed for appropriate interpretation of the modeled output5,6. With increasing emphasis on applying disease control measures in a manner that minimizes the impact and disruption to non-affected industries, models used to inform national strategies for FMD control must often address complex aspects of farm structure, demography, and animal movements, as well as surveillance, quarantine, and depopulation strategies7,8. While the phenomenon of incubation phase transmission of FMD in pigs has been previously identified9, the impact of preclinical transmission and the value of explicitly including this phase in disease spread and control modeling has not been evaluated.",

            "text": "The classical definitions of disease state progressions at the level of the infected individual includes the incubation (pre-clinical) and the latent (pre-infectious) periods. Disease control becomes increasingly challenging when the latent period is shorter than the incubation period, since an infected individual may transmit the pathogen to numerous contacts prior to identification of clinical disease and subsequent implementation of control interventions10. The proportion of transmission that occurs during the incubation phase is commonly denoted by theta (\u03b8)11,12. A low value of \u03b8 indicates correspondingly low extent of transmission prior to observation of clinical disease. Although a low \u03b8 is relatively uncommon, this has been associated with infectious diseases for which control or eradication programs have been highly successful such as smallpox and rinderpest11,13. At the other end of the spectrum are diseases for which \u03b8 is remarkably high, such as HIV/AIDS, which are notoriously difficult to control11. Closely related to the concept of \u03b8 is the temporal disparity between incubation and latency which represents the period of infectiousness included within the incubation period, defined herein as \u03c9 (omega; Fig. 1). While \u03b8 is intrinsically linked to the total length of the infectious period (often difficult to measure), \u03c9 can be estimated without having knowledge of the termination of infectiousness. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) of a pathogen is frequently cited to project and characterize an infectious disease epidemic. This quantity is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case during its entire period of infectiousness, in a completely susceptible population and in the absence of control measures14,15. Thus, in addition to aspects intrinsic to the specific host-pathogen combination, R0 will also be affected by numerous extrinsic factors at the population level. Combining estimates for R0, \u03b8, and \u03c9 provides a robust background for evaluating the importance of preclinical transmission in successful modeling of disease spread and control interventions.",

            "text": "This current study focused on investigating the concept of \u03b8 and \u03c9 for direct contact transmission of a virulent strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) amongst juvenile domestic pigs, and examining the impact of pre-clinical transmission on simulated outbreak size and severity within a US swine production system assuming either optimal or suboptimal response conditions. FMDV is a highly contagious viral pathogen of cloven-hoofed domestic and wild animals (genus: Aphthovirus, family: Picornaviridae)16,17. The virus, which is the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), has been associated with multiple major disease epidemics in previously free regions in recent years18\u201320. Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, the ability to predict potential FMD dissemination in a na\u00efve population and assess the effectiveness of control interventions can result in critical improvements in preparedness and emergency response for food animal production systems4. However, data-driven modeling is intrinsically and precariously dependent upon the appropriateness of the data used for parameterization. Recent work examining incubation phase transmission of FMDV amongst cattle has been inconsistent between two studies suggesting either a high value of \u03b8 for dairy cattle or a low value for calves12,21. In contrast to this, a similar investigation demonstrated the occurrence of substantial transmission of FMDV during the incubation phase in group-housed pigs9. This current report provides novel modeling approaches based upon the data obtained from this recent transmission study9. The findings presented herein suggest a difference between the duration of the latent- and incubation periods (pre-clinical infectiousness; \u03c9) in FMDV-infected pigs that is statistically significantly greater than 0, and a resultant \u03b8 that is larger than previously suggested in studies of FMDV transmission in cattle. Additionally, simulating FMD outbreak scenarios using fixed and incrementally increasing values of \u03c9 demonstrated significant influence of incubation phase transmission on the size and duration of FMD outbreaks in US pig production systems, even in the presence of rigorous control strategies.",

Successful transmission from donors was determined by confirmed occurrence of FMD in contact-exposed pigs subsequent to exposure. The progression of infection was monitored and quantitated in both donors and contact-exposed pigs through measurements of viral genomic RNA in serum and oropharyngeal fluids (OPF). In brief, all 5 pigs in the donor group were confirmed to have been infected by needle-free oropharyngeal inoculation with FMDV and were shedding FMDV RNA in OPF throughout the contact transmission trial. Viremia in donor pigs was first detected at 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), whereas fever (rectal temperatures >40 \u00b0C) and vesicular lesions were observed simultaneously at 48 hpi (Supplementary Fig. S1).",

By the posterior information, the length of the latent period was updated to last about 27 hours (Table 1). Thus, the latent period is likely longer than a day and the effect of the observed data was large enough to influence the diffuse prior information (Table 1; Fig. 3a). In contrast to this, the durations of the incubation and total infectious periods by posterior distributions were not significantly different from the prior distributions (Fig. 3b,c).",

Assuming a median total infectious period of 180 hours as estimated by the Bayesian model, \u03b8 was estimated to be 0.12. The duration of the subclinical phase of infectiousness corresponds to the difference between incubation and latent periods, both of which were modeled based upon directly measured experimental data.

Defining the onset of infectiousness by the occurrence of clinical signs in donors led to a 23 hour discrepancy of latency compared to the CTE-standard, with a prolonged latent period of 50 hours (95% CI 48\u201353 hours), and an \u03c9 of \u22121.20 hours (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S2).

The practical ramification of this finding is that pigs that are infected with FMDV are capable of transmitting disease for approximately 1 day prior to the development of any visible signs of infection, which could lead to further disease spread through animal movements and indirect contacts before a producer realizes through clinical observation that there is a health problem in the herd. In order to assess the impact of the duration of the subclinical infectious period in FMDV-infected pigs on outbreak size and duration, we performed a series of FMD outbreak simulations with the US national FMD model (InterSpread Plus (ISP) version 6.0 model software22), which can account for the complex movements and interactions seen in intensive pig production systems. Simulations were run on a reduced farm population file composed of 45,509 swine operations with 8 different production types and a total of 54,628,373 pigs, in the eastern United States (Supplementary Fig. S2). Surveillance and control measures were modeled including passive and active surveillance in zones around infected premises, movement restrictions in the 10k zone around infected premises, and depopulation of infected premises. Under optimal conditions, detection of the index case was based on the onset of clinical signs within the herd and depopulation occurred within 3 to 5 days (depending on herd size) at a rate of 15 farms/day. For the suboptimal response, initial detection was delayed 14 days, and depopulation was delayed 7 days. For both the optimal and suboptimal responses, the duration of subclinical infectiousness was varied from 0 to 5 days, and the effect on outbreak size and duration examined. Overall, incremental increases of subclinical infectious period (\u03c9) led to substantial increases in the size and severity of simulated outbreaks under both categories of outbreak responses.",

When the outbreak response was assumed to be suboptimal, the effects of increasing \u03c9 were more profound, with a one-day subclinical infectious period resulting in median outbreak size increasing by 166 farms (40%), outbreak duration increasing from 88 days to 101 days, and euthanasia of 664,912 additional pigs required (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S3).

The ultimate goal of such modeling is to guide and assess the effectiveness of control measures to minimize disease impacts, quantitated as morbidity, mortality, economic loss, or other relevant metrics4,5. The overarching objective of the current investigation was to use detailed data from a carefully executed experimental study of FMDV transmission9 to model the durations of distinct stages of disease in FMDV-infected pigs, and to highlight the importance of addressing incubation phase (subclinical) transmission in FMD models. In order to explore the concept of disease spread before clinical detection, it was of particular interest to estimate the latent period (time from infection until onset of infectiousness) in relation to the incubation period (time from infection until appearance of clinical signs of disease). The estimated parameters were subsequently used to explore the impact of alterations in the duration of subclinical infectiousness on simulated FMD outbreaks in commercial swine production systems under both optimal and suboptimal response conditions.",

The simulations in this current investigation utilized the national FMD model developed by the US Department of Agriculture to simulate FMD outbreaks within the US pig production system. This model is adapted to specific conditions within the US agricultural system, and parameterized to reflect the complex and overlapping outbreak response measures identified in the US national FMD outbreak response plan24. Additionally, the model is flexible and allows for adjustment of select parameters, as was performed in the current study to explore the effect of preclinical transmission on simulated outbreaks. Similar to other disease spread models, this model is built upon assumptions concerning specific characteristics of the US production system for which it was designed. Extrapolation of the modeled output should therefore be done with caution. However, under the given circumstances, the outcome of the outbreak simulations included herein serve to emphasize the critical impact that the occurrence of disease transmission during the incubation phase may have on the magnitude of an FMD outbreak. Parameters for modeling of disease outbreaks are usually derived from meta-analyses of published experimental investigations that were not originally designed to assess disease transmission25,26. Bayesian methods offer an alternative approach to inferring epidemiologic parameters from transmission experiments, which can improve our understanding of the latent and infectious periods6,12. Regardless of the method used, in the absence of data explicitly describing actual disease transmission, different proxy measures must be used to define the transition between distinct stages of disease.",

In the current investigation, the proxy measure of high-threshold shedding was interpreted to be the most relevant predictor of transmissibility of FMDV. Onset of viremia was also correlated with infectiousness, which is likely due to the role of viremia in causing systemic  dissemination and shedding of virus. As demonstrated in this investigation, inappropriate use of proxy measures to define the onset of infectiousness in replacement of actual transmission data can lead to drastic misinterpretations of the transmission potential of infected animals. These misinterpretations may in turn affect FMD outbreak simulations, resulting in underestimation of outbreak size and severity, leading to unrealistic estimates of resource needs and misguided guidance on the appropriate application of control interventions. Specifically, underestimating the potential for disease transmission during the incubation phase may lead to wider dissemination of the outbreak than anticipated, and subsequent failure of reactive control interventions such as vaccination. Contrastingly, overestimating disease transmission can promote excessively aggressive countermeasures and lead to destruction of large numbers of healthy animals and associated economic losses. This may result in substantial animal welfare issues and added economic losses as products and animals from unaffected farms cannot enter the production chain. Appropriately balanced interventions are thus critical to effectively control disease spread while striving to maintain business continuity.",

            "text": "The current investigation demonstrated that the modeled onset of infectiousness in FMDV-infected pigs occurred approximately one day prior to appearance of clinical signs of disease, as was consistent with the primary descriptive data from these experiments9. This is consistent with earlier work which demonstrated FMD transmission during the incubation phase in pigs, lambs, and cattle21. However, one published work contradicts these findings by suggesting that FMD is unlikely to be transmitted before the onset of clinical disease12. Although there is limited published information on this subject, the consensus of available data suggests that subclinical transmission of FMD does occur, indicating that incubation is longer than latency and the resultant \u03c9 is greater than zero. This result was concluded based on the significant disparity between the durations of incubation and latency which indicated a distinct period of subclinical infectiousness that was demonstrated by experimentation and verified by modeling. Due to the limited group sizes and ubiquitous infection in groups to which transmission occurred, it was not possible to estimate R0 in the current investigation. However, previous investigations have estimated the basic reproduction ratio, R0, for FMDV within groups of non-vaccinated pigs in experimental settings to be as high as 30.74 (95% CI: 11.09\u201385.17)21 or 40 (95% CI: 21\u201374)27. The combination of a generally high R0 for within-group transmission of FMDV in pigs, and a positive value for \u03c9 as determined in the current study suggests that the potential for FMDV transmission during the incubation phase should be recognized when modeling FMD outbreak scenarios.",

Fraser et al.11 identified a relationship between R0, \u03b8, and the effectiveness of control interventions to bring an outbreak under control. As R0 and \u03b8 increase, control interventions must be highly effective, and multiple interventions are required in order bring the outbreak under control. Estimated values of R0 and \u03b8 for FMDV suggest that control of epidemics is dependent on using multiple, highly effective control interventions. Interestingly, these results may also suggest that isolation and contact tracing, if conducted nearly perfectly, could eventually be sufficient to prevent epidemic propagation. However, in the absence of significant technological advances, such interventions are unlikely to be implemented perfectly in livestock populations, and the timelines required for disease control could be much longer than when more interventions are enacted simultaneously.",

Samples collected were oropharyngeal swabs to assess virus shedding and blood samples to measure viremia. Clinical examinations and sample collection were done at 8\u201324 hour intervals after exposure.

The four evaluated proxies were defined as follows: (a) detection of FMDV RNA in serum, (b) detection of any FMDV RNA in OPF, (c) detection of FMDV RNA in OPF above a threshold of 6.5 log10 GCN/ml, which had previously been associated with successful transmission of FMDV9 (d) clinical signs of FMD. The data were input into a Bayesian model via five distinct indicator matrices, one for each measure of transmission, in which the number of rows equaled the number of contact animals-hours-post-inoculation combinations and the number of columns represented the five donor pigs. Each entry in the matrices was either a 1, if the donor animal met the criteria for successful transmission for the given transmission metric (Table 2) during exposure to the contact animal represented by that row, or a 0 if the donor animal did not meet the criteria for successful transmission given transmission metric at that time. For the CTE-standard transmission metric, which was defined by confirmed transmission to contact-exposed pigs, the vector for all donors was identical as the effect of individual donors on contact animal could not be determined as both sets of animals were exposed to one another in groups.",

Estimates of disease stage durations were derived from modeling of animal-level infection dynamics (Table 1). The originally modeled output consisted of estimates for the durations of latent (E), incubation (C) and infectious (I) periods. The durations of the subclinical infectious period (\u03c9 = C \u2212 E) and clinical infectious period (IC = I \u2212 C) were derived from these outputs. In addition to the baseline scenario (\u03c9 = 1 day), five omega values (0 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days) were subjectively selected to evaluate the effect on altering the duration of the subclinical infectious period on the spread and duration of simulated outbreaks. While choosing different omega values, the durations of latent and clinical infectious periods were kept constant (similar to baseline scenario) except for the scenario in which \u03c9 = 0 day of omega where the latent duration was set to 2 days (Supplementary Table S4). The Within-herd (WH) software version 0.9.7 available through the North American Animal Disease Spread Model35 was used to estimate herd-level parameters based on the modeled animal-level FMD disease stage durations. A spatial microsimulation model called the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) was used to generate a synthetic population file of 45,509 farms with 54,628,373 total pigs36 representative of pig production systems in the eastern United States (Supplementary Fig. S2). The US pig farms (with essential attributes for ISP such as identification number, herd size, type of farms, and Cartesian coordinates) located in the Great Lake, North East and South East regions were included in the model scenarios. About 72% (N = 45, 509) of the total pig farms in the United States are located in these regions. Amongst these farms, 31% were commercial farms with a median herd size of 2725 pigs (range: 100 to 60, 595) and 69% were small-scale enterprises with a median herd size of 6 pigs (range: 1 to 99). Farm-type specific movement parameters and contact rates were assigned to reflect differences in movements between commercial and small-scale enterprises. FMD outbreak simulations were performed using InterSpread Plus (ISP) version 6.0 model software22. The ISP is a state-transition, stochastic and spatial modeling tool for the simulation of FMD and other similar diseases37. Twelve FMD outbreak scenarios were developed in ISP representing optimal and suboptimal outbreak response conditions for each of 6 distinct values for the duration of subclinical infectiousness: 0 day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days of omega, respectively (Supplementary Table S4).",

After exposure to FMDV, the susceptible farms were modeled to transit into latent, subclinically infectious, clinically infectious, and depopulated states. The spread of FMDV from an infected to susceptible farms was modeled to occur through direct contact, indirect contact, and local spread (Supplementary Note). The daily probability of transmission of FMD virus from infected farms to susceptible farm was calculated as the hypergeometric probability of shipping at least one infected animal off of an infected farm given the average herd size, shipment size, and the number of infected animals in a herd on a given day (Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Note). Once an infected farm was detected, several control strategies were imposed simultaneously as is typically performed in response to outbreaks in FMD-free areas. Control strategies included zoning of control areas, tracing of animal movements, animal movement restrictions, depopulation of the infected farms, and surveillances as delineated in the national response plan for FMD24 (Supplementary Note). For each of the omega scenarios, two overall control strategies (optimal and suboptimal) were separately simulated. In the optimal control strategy, the detection of infected farms through passive surveillance was modeled to occur just after onset of clinical signs, which was further delayed by 14 days in suboptimal control category. Additionally, the delay in depopulation of detected farms was 3 (small farms) to 5 days (big farms) in the optimal control category, which was delayed by 7 more days to represent the suboptimal control. The major outputs parameters were outbreak size (number of infected farms and pigs), epidemic duration (days from onset of infection to end of epidemic), time between onset of infection to detection, and daily new infected farms due to each of the incorporated omega values. The median and interquartile range of outbreak size and epidemic duration were reported. The data analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA, 2017) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, Washington, 2017). The Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni corrections was performed for multiple group comparisons for the outcomes from various omega values. A p-value of \u22640.05% was considered for statistical significance.",

The proxy measures consisted of detection of FMDV RNA in blood (\u201cViremia\u201d), detection of FMDV shedding in oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) either above the assay lower limit detection (\u201cany\u201d shedding), or above a defined threshold of 6.5 log10 FMDV RNA copies per ml (\u201cthreshold\u201d shedding), or detection of clinical signs of FMD.
