Because of the short duration, limited geographical coverage, and small sample size (679 specimens overall), data from this period were not used in the analyses. From week 20/2009 to week 9/2011, a universal surveillance scheme was implemented whereby all ILI and SARI patients presenting at all hospitals, local health units, airports and harbours in the country were swabbed. Finally, from week 10/2011 until the end of the study period, a sentinel surveillance scheme for SARI was in place that included selected hospitals and local health units in the whole country.",

The distribution of the dependent variable was compared across age groups using patients aged 18\u201339 years (young adults) as the reference group. The regression coefficients are expressed as relative risk ratio (RRR), which should be interpreted as follows: a RRR equal to 1.43 for influenza B among patients aged 5\u201317 years means that their relative risk of testing positive for influenza B (instead of testing negative) is 43% higher than among young adults.",
