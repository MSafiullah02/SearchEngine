Whereas clinical informatics deals with the management of information related to the delivery of health care, bioinformatics focuses on the management of information related to the underlying basic biological sciences. As such, the two disciplines are closely related-more so than generally appreciated (see Chapter 1). Bioinformatics and clinical informatics share a concentration on systems that are inherently uncertain, difficult to measure, and the result of complicated interactions among multiple complex components. Both deal with living systems that generally lack straight edges and right angles. Although reductionist approaches to studying these systems can provide valuable lessons, it is often necessary to analyze them using integrative models that are not based solely on first principles. Nonetheless, the two disciplines approach the patient from opposite directions. Whereas applications within clinical informatics usually are concerned with the social systems of medicine, the cognitive processes of medicine, and the technologies required to understand human physiology, bioinformatics is concerned with understanding how basic biological systems conspire to create molecules, organelles, living cells, organs, and entire organisms. Remarkably, however, the two disciplines share significant methodological elements, so an understanding of the issues in bioinformatics can be valuable for the student of clinical informatics.",

In addition to small, relatively focused experimental studies aimed at particular molecules thought to be important for disease, large-scale experimental methodologies are used to collect data on thousands or millions of molecules simultaneously. Scientists apply these methodologies longitudinally over time and across a wide variety of organisms or (within an organism) organs to watch the evolution of various physiological phenomena. New technologies give us the abilities to follow the production and degradation of molecules on DNA arrays 4 (Lashkari et al., 1997) , to study the expression of large numbers of proteins with one another (Bai and Elledge, 1997) , and to create multiple variations on a genetic theme to explore the implications of various mutations on biological function (Spee et al., 1993) . All these technologies, along with the genome-sequencing projects, are conspiring to produce a volume of biological information that at once contains secrets to age-old questions about health and disease and threatens to overwhelm our current capabilities of data analysis.

            "text": "With the first set of human genomes now available, it will soon become cost-effective to consider sequencing or genotyping at least sections of many other genomes. The sequence of a gene involved in disease may provide the critical information that we need to select appropriate treatments. For example, the set of genes that produces essential hypertension may be understood at a level sufficient to allow us to target antihypertensive medications based on the precise configuration of these genes. It is possible that clinical trials may use information about genetic sequence to define precisely the population of patients who would benefit from a new therapeutic agent. Finally, clinicians may learn the sequences of infectious agents (such as of the Escherichia coli strain that causes recurrent urinary tract infections) and store them in a patient's record to record the precise pathogenicity and drug susceptibility observed during an episode of illness. In any case, it is likely that genetic information will need to be included in the medical record and will introduce special problems. Raw sequence information, whether from the patient or the pathogen, is meaningless without context and thus is not well suited to a printed medical record. Like images, it can come in high information density and must be presented to the clinician in novel ways. As there are for laboratory tests, there may be a set of nondisease (or normal) values to use as comparisons, and there may be difficulties in interpreting abnormal values. Fortunately, most of the human genome is shared and identical among individuals; less than 1 percent of the genome seems to be unique to individuals. Nonetheless, the effects of sequence information on clinical databases will be significant. 2. New diagnostic and prognostic information sources. One of the main contributions of the genome-sequencing projects (and of the associated biological innovations) is that we are likely to have unprecedented access to new diagnostic and prognostic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic markers are used to identify how a patient's genome differs from the draft genome. Diagnostically, the genetic markers from a patient with an autoimmune disease, or of an infectious pathogen within a patient, will be highly specific and sensitive indicators of the subtype of disease and of that subtype's probable responsiveness to different therapeutic agents. For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was determined to be a corona virus using a gene expression array containing the genetic information from several common pathogenic viruses. 5 In general, diagnostic tools based on the gene sequences within a patient are likely to increase greatly the number and variety of tests available to the physician. Physicians will not be able to manage these tests without significant computational assistance. Moreover, genetic information will be available to provide more accurate prognostic information to patients. What is the standard course for this disease? How does it respond to these medications? Over time, we will be able to answer these questions with increasing precision, and will develop computational systems to manage this information. Several genotype-based databases have been developed to identify markers that are associated with specific phenotypes and identify how genotype affects a patient's response to therapeutics. The Human Gene Mutations Database (HGMD) annotates mutations with disease phenotype. 6 This resource has become invaluable for genetic counselors, basic researchers, and clinicians. Additionally, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) collects genetic information that is known to affect a patient's response to a drug. 7 As these data sets, and others like them, continue to improve, the first clinical benefits from the genome projects will be realized. 3. Ethical considerations. One of the critical questions facing the genome-sequencing projects is \"Can genetic information be misused?\" The answer is certainly yes. With knowledge of a complete genome for an individual, it may be possible in the future to predict the types of disease for which that individual is at risk years before the disease actually develops. If this information fell into the hands of unscrupulous employers or insurance companies, the individual might be denied employment or coverage due to the likelihood of future disease, however distant. There is even debate about whether such information should be released to a patient even if it could be kept confidential. Should a patient be informed that he or she is likely to get a disease for which there is no treatment? This is a matter of intense debate, and such questions have significant implications for what information is collected and for how and to whom that information is disclosed (Durfy, 1993; see Chapter 10).",

B. Altman and S. D. Mooney tion of DNA for a single person or organism is referred to as the genome. DNA is a long polymer chemical made of four basic subunits. The sequence in which these subunits occur in the polymer distinguishes one DNA molecule from another, and the sequence of DNA subunits in turn directs a cell's production of proteins and all other basic cellular processes. Genes are discreet units encoded in DNA and they are transcribed into ribonucleic acid (RNA), which has a composition very similar to DNA. Genes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and a majority of mRNA sequences are translated by ribosomes into protein. Not all RNAs are messengers for the translation of proteins. Ribosomal RNA, for example, is used in the construction of the ribosome, the huge molecular engine that translates mRNA sequences into protein sequences.",

It is necessary to support queries such as, \"What sequence motifs are present in this sequence?\" It is often difficult to represent these multiple, nested relationships within standard relational database schema. In addition, the neighbors of a sequence element are also critical, and it is important to be able to perform queries such as, \"What sequence elements are seen 20 elements to the left of this element?\" For these reasons, researchers in bioinformatics are developing object-oriented databases (see Chapter 6) in which a sequence can be queried in different ways, depending on the needs of the user (Altman, 2003) .",

On the other hand, the three-dimensional structure information about the proteins that are produced from the DNA sequences is much more difficult and expensive to obtain, and presents a separate set of analysis challenges. Currently, only about 30,000 three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules are known. 11 These models are incredibly valuable resources, however, because an understanding of structure often yields detailed insights about biological function. As an example, the structure of the ribosome has been determined for several species and contains more atoms than any other to date. This structure, because of its size, took two decades to solve, and presents a formidable challenge for functional annotation (Cech, 2000) . Yet, the functional information for a single structure is vastly outsized by the potential for comparative genomics analysis between the structures from several organisms and from varied forms of the functional complex, since the ribosome is ubiquitously required for all forms of life. Thus a wealth of information comes from relatively few structures. To address the problem of limited structure information, the publicly funded structural genomics initiative aims to identify all of the common structural scaffolds found in nature and grow the number of known structures considerably. In the end, it is the physical forces between molecules that determine what happens within a cell; thus the more complete the picture, the better the functional understanding. In particular, understanding the physical properties of therapeutic agents is the key to understanding how agents interact with their targets within the cell (or within an invading organism). These are the key questions for structural biology within bioinformatics:",

The premise is relatively simple; up to 40,000 gene sequences derived from genomic data are fixed onto a glass slide or filter. An experiment is performed where two groups of cells are grown in different conditions, one group is a control group and the other is the experimental group. The control group is grown normally, while the experimental group is grown under experimental conditions. For example, a researcher may be trying to understand how a cell compensates for a lack of sugar. The experimental cells will be grown with limited amounts of sugar. As the sugar depletes, some of the cells are removed at specific intervals of time. When the cells are removed, all of the mRNA from the cells is separated and converted back to DNA, using special enzymes. This leaves a pool of DNA molecules that are only from the genes that were turned on (expressed) in that group of cells. Using a chemical reaction, the experimental DNA sample is attached to a red fluorescent molecule and the control group is attached to a green fluorescent molecule. These two samples are mixed and then washed over the glass slide. The two samples contain only genes that were turned on in the cells, and they are labeled either red or green depending on whether they came from the experimental group or the control group. The labeled DNA in the pool sticks or hybridizes to the same gene on the glass slide. This leaves the glass slide with up to 40,000 spots and genes that were turned on in the cells are now bound with a label to the appropriate spot on the slide. Using a scanning confocal microscope and a laser to fluoresce the linkers, the amount of red and green fluorescence in each spot can be measured. The ratio of red to green determines whether that gene is being turned off (downregulated) in the experimental group or whether the gene is being turned on (upregulated). The experiment has now measured the activity of genes in an entire cell due to some experimental change. Figure 22 .1 illustrates a typical gene expression experiment from SMD. 13 Computers are critical for analyzing these data, because it is impossible for a researcher to comprehend the significance of those red and green spots. Currently scientists are using gene expression experiments to study how cells from different organ- isms compensate for environmental changes, how pathogens fight antibiotics, and how cells grow uncontrollably (as is found in cancer). A new challenge for biological computing is to develop methods to analyze these data, tools to store these data, and computer systems to collect the data automatically.",

Smith and Waterman (1981) published refinements of these algorithms that allowed for searching both the best global alignment of two sequences (aligning all the elements of the two sequences) and the best local alignment (searching for areas in which there are segments of high similarity surrounded by regions of low similarity). A key input for these algorithms is a matrix that encodes the similarity or substitutability of sequence elements: When there is an inexact match between two elements in an alignment of sequences, it specifies how much \"partial credit\" we should give the overall alignment based on the similarity of the elements, even though they may not be identical. Looking at a set of evolutionarily related proteins, Dayhoff et al.

The first release, in 1977, contained 77 structures. The growth of the database is chronicled on the Web: 14 the PDB now has over 30,000 detailed atomic structures and is the primary source of information about the relationship between protein sequence and protein structure. Similarly, as the ability to obtain the sequence of DNA molecules became widespread, the need for a database of these sequences arose. In the mid-1980s, the GENBANK database was formed as a repository of sequence information. Starting with 606 sequences and 680,000 bases in 1982, the GENBANK has grown by much more than 2 million sequences and 100 billion bases. The GENBANK database of DNA sequence information supports the experimental reconstruction of genomes and acts as a focal point for experimental groups. 15 Numerous other databases store the sequences of protein molecules 16 and information about human genetic diseases. 17 Included among the databases that have accelerated the development of bioinformatics is the Medline 18 database of the biomedical literature and its paper-based companion Index Medicus (see Chapter 19). Including articles as far back as 1953 and brought online free on the Web in 1997, Medline provides the glue that relates many high-level biomedical concepts to the low-level molecule, disease, and experimental methods.

The problem of alignment is not trivial but is based on a simple idea. Sequences that perform a similar function should, in general, be descendants of a common ancestral sequence, with mutations over time. These mutations can be replacements of one amino acid with another, deletions of amino acids, or insertions of amino acids. The goal of sequence alignment is to align two sequences so that the evolutionary relationship between the sequences becomes clear. If two sequences are descended from the same ancestor and have not mutated too much, then it is often possible to find corresponding locations in each sequence that play the same role in the evolved proteins. The problem of solving correct biological alignments is difficult because it requires knowledge about the evolution of the molecules that we typically do not have. There are now, however, well-established algorithms for finding the mathematically optimal alignment of two sequences. These algorithms require the two sequences and a scoring system based on (1) exact matches between amino acids that have not mutated in the two sequences and can be aligned perfectly; (2) partial matches between amino acids that have mutated in ways that have preserved their overall biophysical properties; and (3) gaps in the alignment signifying places where one sequence or the other has undergone a deletion or insertion of amino acids. The algorithms for determining optimal sequence alignments are based on a technique in computer science known as dynamic programming and are at the heart of many computational biology applications (Gusfield, 1997) .

An understanding of the structural interaction between a drug and its target molecule often provides critical insight into the drug's mechanism of action. The most reliable way to assess this interaction is to use experimental methods to solve the structure of a drug-target complex. Once again, these experimental approaches are expensive, so computational methods play an important role. Typically, we can assess the physical and chemical features of the drug molecule and can use them to find complementary regions of the target. For example, a highly electronegative drug molecule will be most likely to bind in a pocket of the target that has electropositive features.",

A typical experiment is represented as a large table, where the rows are the genes on each chip and the columns represent the different experiments, whether they be time points or different experimental conditions. Within each cell is the red to green ratio of that gene's experimental results. Each row is then a vector of values that represent the results of the experiment with respect to a specific gene. Clustering can then be performed to determine which genes are being expressed similarly. Genes that are associated with similar expression profiles are often functionally associated. For example, when a cell is subjected to starvation (fasting), ribosomal genes are often downregulated in anticipation of lower protein production by the cell. It has similarly been shown that genes associated with neoplastic progression could be identified relatively easily with this method, making gene expression experiments a powerful assay in cancer research (see Guo, 2003, for review) . In order to cluster expression data, a distance metric must be determined to compare a gene's profile with another gene's profile. If the vector data are a list of values, Euclidian distance or correlation distances can be used. If the data are more complicated, more sophisticated distance metrics may be employed.

Hierarchical methods build a dendrogram, or a tree, of the genes based on ing close neighbors into a cluster. The first step often involves connecting the closest profiles, building an average profile of the joined profiles, and repeating until the entire tree is built. K-means clustering builds k clusters or groups automatically. The algorithm begins by picking k representative profiles randomly. Then each gene is associated with the representative to which it is closest, as defined by the distance metric being employed. Then the center of mass of each cluster is determined using all of the member gene's profiles. Depending on the implementation, either the center of mass or the nearest member to it becomes the new representative for that cluster. The algorithm then iterates until the new center of mass and the previous center of mass are within some threshold. The result is k groups of genes that are regulated similarly. One drawback of K-means is that one must chose the value for k. If k is too large, logical \"true\" clusters may be split into pieces and if k is too small, there will be clusters that are Bioinformatics 777 commonly applied because these methods require no knowledge of the data, and can Supervised learning methods require some preconceived knowledge of the data at representative profile to which they are most similar. Unsupervised methods are more their expression profiles. These methods are agglomerative and work by iteratively join-merged. One way to determine whether the chosen k is correct is to estimate the average distance from any member profile to the center of mass. By varying k, it is best to choose the lowest k where this average is minimized for each cluster. Another drawback of K-means is that different initial conditions can give different results, therefore it is often prudent to test the robustness of the results by running multiple runs with different starting configurations (Figure 22.4) .",

A new challenge immediately emerges, however: collecting individual sequence data from patients who have disease. Researchers estimate that more than 99 percent of the DNA sequences within humans are identical, but the remaining sequences are different and account for our variability in susceptibility to and development of disease states. It is not unreasonable to expect that for particular disease syndromes, the detailed genetic information for individual patients will provide valuable information that will allow us to tailor treatment protocols and perhaps let us make more accurate prognoses. There are significant problems associated with obtaining, organizing, analyzing, and using this information.",

Although we have a good understanding of the principles by which small groups of molecules interact, we are not able to fully explain how thousands of molecules interact within a cell to create both normal and abnormal physiological states. As the databases continue to accumulate information ranging from patient-specific data to fundamental genetic information, a major challenge is creating the conceptual links between these databases to create an audit trail from molecular-level information to macroscopic phenomena, as manifested in disease. The availability of these links will facilitate the identification of important targets for future research and will provide a scaffold for biomedical knowledge, ensuring that important literature is not lost within the increasing volume of published data.",

Already, certain types of simple data that are produced in large volumes are expected to be included in manuscripts submitted for publication, including new sequences that are required to be deposited in GENBANK and new structure coordinates that are deposited in the PDB. However, there are many other experimental data sources that are currently difficult to provide in a standardized way, because the data either are more intricate than those stored in GENBANK or PDB or are not produced in a volume sufficient to fill a database devoted entirely to the relevant area.

The structure of knowledge bases often leads to unique strategies for storage and retrieval of their content. To build a knowledge base for storing information from biological experiments, there are some requirements. First, the set of experiments to be modeled must be defined. Second, the key attributes of each experiment that should be recorded in the knowledge base must be specified. Third, the set of legal values for each attribute must be specified, usually by creating a controlled terminology for basic data or by specifying the types of knowledge-based entries that can serve as values within the knowledge base.",

RiboWeb is a collaborative tool for ribosomal modeling that has at its center a knowledge base of the ribosomal structural literature. RiboWeb links standard bibliographic references to knowledge-based entries that summarize the key experimental findings reported in each paper. For each type of experiment that can be performed, the key attributes must be specified. Thus, for example, a cross-linking experiment is one in which a small molecule with two highly reactive chemical groups is added to an ensemble of other molecules. The reactive groups attach themselves to two vulnerable parts of the ensemble. Because the molecule is small, the two vulnerable areas cannot be any further from each other than the maximum stretched-out length of the small molecule. Thus, an analysis of the resulting reaction gives information that one part of the ensemble is \"close\" to another part. This experiment can be summarized formally with a few features-for example, target of experiment, cross-linked parts, and cross-linking agent.",

Imagine a computer program that provides a comprehensive simulation of a human body. The simulation would be a complex mathematical model in which all the molecular details of each organ system would be represented in sufficient detail to allow complex \"what if ?\" questions to be asked. For example, a new therapeutic agent could be introduced into the system, and its effects on each of the organ subsystems and on their cellular apparatus could be assessed. The side-effect profile, possible toxicities, and perhaps even the efficacy of the agent could be assessed computationally before trials are begun on laboratory animals or human subjects. The model could be linked to visualizations to allow the teaching of medicine at all grade levels to benefit from our detailed understanding of physiological processes-visualizations would be both anatomic (where things are) and functional (what things do). Finally, the model would provide an interface to human genetic and biological knowledge. What more natural user interface could there be for exploring physiology, anatomy, genetics, and biochemistry than the universally recognizable structure of a human that could be browsed at both macroscopic and microscopic levels of detail? As components of interest were found, they could be selected, and the available literature could be made available to the user. The complete computational model of a human is not close to completion. First, all the participants in the system (the molecules and the ways in which they associate to form higher-level aggregates) must be identified. Second, the quantitative equations and symbolic relationships that summarize how the systems interact have not been elucidated fully. Third, the computational representations and computer power to run such a simulation are not in place. Researchers are, however, working in each of these areas. The genome projects will soon define all the molecules that constitute each organism. Research in simulation and the new experimental technologies being developed will give us an understanding of how these molecules associate and perform their functions. Finally, research in both clinical informatics and bioinformatics will provide the computational infrastructure required to deliver such technologies.",

More importantly, there are technologies that can be shared between bioinformatics and clinical informatics because they both focus on representing, storing, and analyzing biological data. These technologies include the creation and management of standard terminologies and data representations, the integration of heterogeneous databases, the organization and searching of the biomedical literature, the use of machine learning techniques to extract new knowledge, the simulation of biological processes, and the creation of knowledge-based systems to support advanced practitioners in the two fields.",
