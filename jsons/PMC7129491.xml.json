Three cats were inoculated oronasally with the FIPV 79-1146 strain, and developed clinical signs of typical FIP (FIPa, FIPb, and FIPc). When the FCoV gene was investigated in PBMCs of FIPV-infected cats employing RT-PCR,29 the FCoV gene was detected 4\u201312 days after type II FIPV inoculation but not after 18 days. In addition, the FCoV gene was detected in faeces until 18 days after type II FIPV inoculation. In contrast, the FCoV gene was not detected in PBMCs of type I FIPV-infected cats after type I FIPV inoculation, but sporadically detected in faeces for a prolonged period after type I FIPV inoculation. All FIPV-inoculated cats were judged as infected with FIPV based on an increase in the anti-FCoV antibody level in serum collected after FIPV inoculation on ELISA. These cats were maintained in a temperature-controlled, isolated facility. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Kitasato University.",

Competitive ELISA demonstrated 80% or higher inhibition rates for four MAbs (Noko 1-12.3, Noko 3-31.1, Noko 5-23.1, and Ame 4-12.4). The fIFN-\u03b3 neutralisation test demonstrated that three MAbs (Noko 3-31.1, Ame 6-31.1, and Ame 7-19.1) exhibited neutralising activity against fIFN-\u03b3 (Table 1\n). These results suggest that Noko 1-12.3, Noko 5-23.1, and Ame 4-12.4 recognise the same epitope. Noko 3-31.1 inhibited 80% or more of the binding of Noko 1-12.3, Noko 5-23.1, and Ame 4-12.4 to rfIFN-\u03b3. However, Noko 3-31.1 differed from these MAbs in that it showed neutralising activity against fIFN-\u03b3. Ame 6-31.1 and Ame 7-19.1 mutually inhibited 80% or more of their binding to rfIFN-\u03b3. Both showed neutralising activity against fIFN-\u03b3. However, they seemed to recognise different epitopes because of the different inhibition rates for Noko 3-31.1 and Noko 5-23.1. Thus, Noko 1-12.3, Noko 5-23.1, and Ame 4-12.4 recognised the same epitope, while the other MAbs recognised different epitopes.",

In addition, the results of two-colour flow cytometry demonstrated that the percentage of CD8+fIFN-\u03b3\n+ cells was markedly increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation. Thus, stimulating PBMCs obtained from FIPV-infected cats without FIP with heat-inactivated FIPV increased fIFN-\u03b3 production particularly by FIPV-specific memory CD8+ T cells. fIFN-\u03b3 production in PBMC and in particular in FIPV-specific memory CD8+ T cells after infection of the animal, at a stage where the cat may or may not be infected and/or viraemic. It is suggested that FIPV-infected cats without FIP, but not FIP cats, generated potent cellular immunity against FIPV following infection with FIPV and that FIPV-infected cats without FIP generate a protective cellular immunity against FCoV. These results substantiate a previous report that cellular immunity plays an important role in preventing the development of FIP.5, 17, 18, 19, 20 Detecting fIFN-\u03b3 employing sandwich ELISA, ELISpot assay, and two-colour flow cytometry using the anti-fIFN-\u03b3 MAbs created in this study appears to be useful in evaluating the cellular immunity of cats.",
