Materials and methods This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO-and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO-and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO-and peripheralpredominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Results All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO-and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77-0.88 for R1 and 0.78-0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC. Conclusion Chest CT would play a supplemental role to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms in a clinical setting.",

It has become a public health emergency of international concern [1, 2] . There are 109,577 confirmed cases, 28,673 of which are in 104 countries outside of China on March 9th, 2020 [3] . Japan is one of the countries on the brink of an expansion with 457 cases by 12:00 March 10, 2020 [4] . Though the incidence still remains low in comparison with China, the number of cases difficult to identify infection routes is gradually increasing. It is considered that Japan has entered a new phase of the outbreak, switching focus from screening overseas arrivals to catching homegrown cases.",

However, the reported CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, such as ground glass opacity (GGO) or bilateral involvement [10] , are nonspecific and could be found in other infections and inflammatory conditions [14] . Thus, the diagnostic performance of chest CT in a clinical setting, where the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia is lower than that of other respiratory diseases, is still unknown. Considering the rapid spread around the world, there is an urgent need to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory diseases presenting with similar symptoms.",

Assessments of GGO, consolidation, cavity, crazy-paving pattern, and reversed halo sign were according to the definitions of Fleischner Society [16] .

The combination of these criteria could be a powerful tool to triage patients based on the estimation of the probability of COVID-19 in a clinical setting.

The differences of chest CT images between COVID-19 pneumonia and other respiratory diseases might become clearer after this time interval. Another reason might be the difference of prior probabilities. Bai et al. reported the great variation of specificity (24-94%) among seven readers in the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia (cases in China) from viral pneumonia (cases in USA) [13] . In our studies, the specificities for the respective criteria showed less variation as above.
