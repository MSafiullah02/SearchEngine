            "text": "Yellow head disease (YHD) was first described with the occurrence of mass mortalities in farmed black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon in Thailand [1]. After that, it was reported from cultivation ponds elsewhere in Asia and possibly in the Americas, where it also caused high shrimp mortality [2], [3]. The causative agent of YHD is yellow head virus (YHV). Gross signs often associated with YHV infection include cessation of feeding and the development of yellow coloration of the cephalothorax and gills [4]. Subsequent mass mortality of shrimp occurs within 2\u20133 days of the first appearance of gross signs of disease. Lymphoid organs (LOs) and gills of moribund shrimp show large numbers of pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei and densely basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of YHV-infected tissues reveals threadlike nucleocapsids (approximately 15 nm\u00d7130\u2013800 nm) together with mature, enveloped, bacilliform virions of approximately 150\u2013200 nm\u00d740\u201350 nm. Mature virions accumulate within vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells and are deposited in intercellular spaces when vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane [4], [5].",

Several genetic variants of YHV have been reported since the original description of yellow head virus type 1 (YHV-1) [11]. These include a closely related form from Australia first called lymphoid organ virus (LOV) in its non-disease state [14] and later gill-associated virus (GAV) in the disease state [15] associated with aquaculture production losses in Australian shrimp farms [8], [11]. Here, the LOV/GAV variant will be referred to as YHV-2. Comparison of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences indicates that YHV-1 and YHV-2 are distinct but closely related viruses [9], [16]. However, YHV-2 is even more closely related to a non-virulent form of YHV (here called YHV-3) that is known to occur in Vietnam [11] and Thailand [17]. A fourth, non-pathogenic type (here called YHV-4) also occurs in Thailand but has not yet been described (T. Flegel, unpublished).",

Nadala et al. [18] originally reported that YHV particles contained 4 structural proteins of approximately 170, 135, 67 and 22 kDa. Subsequently, only 3 major structural proteins were identified and characterized, including a nucleocapsid protein p20 encoded by ORF2 and envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 encoded by ORF3 [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. It is generally believed that coronaviruses use envelope proteins as recognition molecules for viral\u2013host binding and cell entry [24]. An in-vitro study has supported this by showing that a polyclonal antibody to gp116 inhibited YHV entry into LO cells, whereas an antibody to gp64 did not [25]. Although antisera against YHV have been produced since 1997 [12], [22], development of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) of IgG type specific for each structural protein (Y19 against p20, Y18 against gp64 and V3\u20132B against gp116) has allowed improvement in immunodiagnostic methods such as immunohistochemistry, dot-blot analysis and Western blot analysis [20], [21].",

At the same time, it has recently been found that grossly normal shrimp may sometimes be infected with one or more viruses [31], [32]. An explanation for this phenomenon has been proposed in the viral accommodation concept [30], [33] and some support for it has been obtained in studies of model mosquito cells [34] and whole mosquitoes serially challenged with a densovirus (AThDNV) for 5 successive generations [35]. There was some indication that improved survival of persistently infected cells and mosquitoes might be associated with the relatively high prevalence of defective viral particles sometimes called defective interfering particles (DIP) that were generated in host cells. Improvement in shrimp survival upon viral challenge has also been reported to result from feeding or injecting viral envelope proteins [36], [37], [38] or inactivated viral particles [39] as vaccine-like reagents to elicit what has been called a \u201cpseudo-immune\u201d response [40].",

They originated from specific pathogen-free (SPF) stock and were reared in an outdoor pond that had been treated prior to stocking with insecticide to kill crustacean carrier species and that used controlled water exchanges to prevent carrier entry. Prior to experiments, they were screened for presence of YHV types 1\u20134 using a commercial RT-PCR kit, IQ2000\u2122 YHV/GAV detection and typing system according to the kit instructions (Farming IntelliGene Technology, Taiwan; www.iq2000kit.com). This kit was designed for detection of YHV-1 and YHV-2, but can also be used to detect YHV-3 since it gives an amplicon of 407 bp identical to that of YHV-2. It can also detect YHV-4 that gives an amplicon at 777 bp only (T.W. Flegel, pers. comm.). This amplicon is equivalent to the outer primer amplicon obtained with heavy infections of YHV-1, -2 and -3. For these tests, pleopods from 30 shrimp at day 0 (d0) were sampled and pooled (5 animals per sample) for RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. Negative test results confirmed freedom from YHV at 9% prevalence with 95% confidence [41]. The shrimp were acclimatized for 3\u20135 days in double 1-ton fiberglass tanks containing prepared artificial seawater at 10\u201315 ppt of salinity. Water depth was 0.80 m and 20% of the water was exchanged daily. Adequate aeration and a simple filter unit were employed. The shrimp were maintained under natural photoperiod (12 h:12 h of dark/light cycle) at 27\u201330 \u00b0C. Commercial pelleted feed was provided twice daily at a rate of 3% BW.

To prepare shrimp as the viral source for the co-habitation challenge, 20 shrimp were removed from the stock of 100 P. vannamei at d0 and injected into the muscle of the third or fourth abdominal segment with 0.1 ml of YHV-inoculum solution. After injection, they were placed in a 1-ton container within 4 floating baskets that did not allow close contact with shrimp outside the baskets. These shrimp served as the source of YHV for immersion challenge of the test shrimp. They also served as a positive YHV-injected, reference control for the shrimp challenged by the water-borne route. The challenge test shrimp (Group 1) comprised 50 shrimp placed in the same 1-ton container outside the baskets so that they would all be exposed to YHV at the same level by the water-borne route. The untreated control shrimp (Group 2) comprised 30 shrimp; 10 of these were sampled at the start of the experiment as 0-h controls and 20 were maintained for 14 days in a separate 300-l-tank. The latter comprised incubation controls to monitor the integrity of the culture system and substantiate freedom from YHV. Tanks were continually monitored so that dead and moribund shrimp could be removed immediately. Dead shrimp were not used for analysis. Moribund shrimp were analyzed and were counted as dead shrimp for purposes of survival values. This challenge protocol was repeated in 4 separate experiments to determine repeatability of the survival profile. However, detailed analysis of shrimp samples was confined to Experiment 4, except for the addition of 4 surviving shrimp (2 each from Experiments 2 and 3) for histopathological analysis by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization (ISH) (see below).",

The real-time primers and TaqMan probe for detection of YHV were designed and selected within the 831-bp amplicon of ORF1b using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, CA). The primers YHV70f (5\u2032-CGACATCACTCCAGACAACATCT-3\u2032 and YHV70r (5\u2032-ACAATTGCCGGGACGATATGT-3\u2032) generated a 70-bp DNA fragment after amplification. A TaqMan probe YHV-P (5\u2032-AAGGCGTCTATGACTTCG-3\u2032) that corresponded to the region nucleotides 68\u201385 of the 831 product was also synthesized and labeled with fluorescent dyes, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032-end and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3\u2032-end.

The reaction mixture contained cDNA equivalent to 10 ng of total RNA, each primer at a concentration of 0.3 \u03bcM and the TaqMan probe at a concentration of 0.15 \u03bcM in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. Each sample was assayed in duplicate with the real-time PCR format. The assays were run on an ABI GeneAmp 7500 sequence detection system. The cycling protocol consisted of 50 \u00b0C for 2 min and 95 \u00b0C for 10 min to obtain the optimal enzyme activity needed for the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, CA), followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. The data acquisition and analysis were carried out using the GeneAmp 7500 sequence detector software. Amplification readings of unknown samples were compared with 8 independent amplification plots from the known target region (831 bp) with 102\u2013109\n copies/\u03bcg of a YHV-plasmid standard prepared from the cloning strategy described above. Combinations between the readable data and these 8 standard runs were automatically calculated by the software and a threshold cycle (C\nT) value was set to be above the baseline that began to detect an increase in signal associated with an exponential increase in PCR product. T-test statistical analyses were performed with SigmaStat software Version 2 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Group ranges and means were compared with analysis of variance for the level of YHV copies between moribund and surviving shrimp.",

Survival was 16% (8/50) by d9 and reached 14% (7/50) by d10. Shrimp from d11 onward were defined as survivors. All were normally active and were grossly healthy. One shrimp was removed on d11 for histopathological analysis and the remaining 6 were kept an additional 3 days to d14 when the experiment was terminated. All of the moribund shrimp in Group 1 (20) were positive for YHV by RT-PCR assay or histological plus immunohistochemical and ISH analysis. Survival for the untreated control shrimp in Group 2 was 80% (16/20), indicating that the culture system gave good survival. Like the d0 control shrimp, all incubation control shrimp were negative for YHV by nested RT-PCR assay, including the 4 that died during molting. The absence of YHV in untreated control Group 1 throughout the study confirmed the initial shrimp stock test for freedom from YHV.

To determine the reproducibility of each reaction, we compared 8 amplification curves from 102 to 109 copies of the plasmid cDNA standard. For the combined data from these 8 independent runs, there was a significant linear relation (R\n2=0.992, slope=\u22122.73, intercept=37.2) between C\nV and C\nT values. This is in agreement with similar reports on real-time PCR quantification of shrimp viral loads [45], [46], [47]. Using standard amplification curves for calculations, it was found that YHV copy numbers based on either ORF1b or ORF3 were not significantly different (P>0.05) in the surviving shrimp or in the moribund shrimp (Figure 3\n). Nor was there any significant difference in the mean loads (P>0.05) for the 3 moribund shrimp from the injection group and the 3 from the water challenge group. For the surviving shrimp, the mean of means for ORF1b and ORF3 was 2.2\u00d7104\u00b1SE 6.0\u00d7103\n copies/ng RNA and this was 68 times lower (P<0.05) than that for the moribund shrimp (mean=1.5\u00d7106\u00b1SD 3.0\u00d7105\n copies/ng RNA). Thus, the real-time RT-PCR results confirmed the preliminary results by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, revealing generally lower viral loads in the surviving shrimp than in the moribund shrimp.",

The mechanisms behind rapid transition to the carrier state are currently unknown but could include factors ranging from shrimp capacity to prevent viral entry (into the body or cells) to factors associated with cellular and humoral defenses. It is unlikely that the surviving shrimp had experienced delayed exposure to YHV, leading to early stages of YHV infection that would have progressed to the acute and patent stages of disease with longer incubation. If so, they would have shown at least some YHV-1 pathology including immunohistochemically positive LOT and absence of immunohistochemically positive LOS. Instead, they showed normal LOT together with spheroids similar to those described shrimp with persistent (chronic) viral infections [48], [49]. Our immunohistochemistry results showed that these spheroids were positive for YHV while the LOT were not. This contrasted with moribund shrimp where spheroids were absent and LOT were positive.",

A similar phenomenon has been reported for a plaemonid shrimp species that is tolerant to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infections [53]. In that case, production of the envelope protein vp28 appeared to be suppressed with time after challenge while the level of viral production remained unchanged. The indications were that the ability of these shrimp to tolerate viral infection might be related to control over viral envelope protein production by an unknown mechanism. Presumably, the lack of one or more envelope proteins would reduce the ability of the virus to spread within the host. The P. vannamei survivors in our test system did not show differential suppression of gp116 relative to p20. Instead, both proteins were present at relatively equal but low immunoreactive levels in the survivors when compared with high levels in the moribund shrimp.",

These were identical to YHV virions in previously published electron micrographs from shrimp with acute YHV infections [4]. However, the number of infected cells was higher in the moribund shrimp. Immunogold labeling for the envelope protein gp116 gave positive results for both surviving (Figure 8a) and moribund (Figure 8c) samples. These resembled previous results using immunogold labeling of mature YHV particles [17]. For the nucleoprotein p20 [21], [22] positive reactions were seen in the area of YHV nucleocapsid assembly, also in both surviving (Figure 8b) and moribund (Figure 8d) shrimp. Acquisition of capsids and envelopes often occurred while the viral material was still in the form of long filaments. Once enveloped, the filaments underwent fragmentation to produce the shorter, rod-shaped, mature virions as previously described for YHV [4]. The fact that both mature and immature developmental stages of YHV were seen in both the moribund and surviving shrimp from Group 1, proved that both had active YHV infections.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for YHV-1 tolerance in the survivors is that they represented a small and distinct sub-population of the test shrimp that had genetically based, innate tolerance to YHV-1. With respect to innate genetic tolerance to viral pathogens, it has been reported for Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and infectious hypodermal and hematopoetic necrosis virus (IHHNV) that tolerant stocks can be genetically selected in controlled breeding programs by using results from off-site tests with the offspring of breeding stocks [3], [54], [55]. Such commercial stocks are now used widely in the shrimp industry. As a result, we cannot exclude the possibility that the challenge survivors in our experiments had common genetic factors that were not present in the dead/moribund shrimp and that this was the underlying reason for their survival. On the other hand, the exact genetic basis and biochemical mechanisms underlying genetic disease tolerance in commercial stocks is currently unknown and no specific genetic markers linked to it have yet been published. As stated above, they could include factors ranging from cellular and humoral immunity to physical/physiological barriers to viral entry. One way forward would be to carry out detailed genetic profiling of moribund and surviving shrimp from challenge tests such as ours.",

            "text": "Another possible explanation for the survivors is the development of tolerance during the course of YHV-1 challenge. There is some indication that this may be possible in crustaceans [30]. The first report of the phenomenon was for WSSV infections in the Kuruma shrimp Penaeus japonicus where survivors from a WSSV outbreak showed high survival upon re-challenge with a dose of WSSV that was lethal to na\u00efve control shrimp [56]. Subsequent laboratory tests revealed that the phenomenon could be repeated in the laboratory and it was called a quasi-immune response. In all cases, at least some of the quasi-immune shrimp tested positive for WSSV, suggesting that they remained infected after challenge and might better be called tolerant than immune or resistant to WSSV. The situation is similar to that reported for TSV, where survivors remain infected and tolerant possibly for life [48], [49]. For example, it has been shown that YHV-2 (also called GAV) is commonly found in captured broodstock that can transmit the virus to their offspring [57]. There are similar reports for WSSV [58]. Thus, like the question regarding innate genetic tolerance, the question of adaptive tolerance must be left open at this time. Nor is it clear whether these 2 possibilities are mutually exclusive.",

Despite the low level of YHV-1, they do produce some complete virions and, by reference to other reports, would probably be infectious for na\u00efve P. vannamei. Thus, they appear to be tolerant rather than resistant to YHV-1 infection. The basis for this tolerance is still unknown but our results suggest that it is not likely to be related to challenge dose. Questions as to whether the tolerance is based on some type of adaptive processes in the survivors, on inherent genetics of the survivors or on a combination of these factors remain unresolved. The association of YHV-1 positive LOS with the tolerant shrimp suggests that closer study of LO function may help to answer some of these questions.",
