Up to date, it has caused 1952 human infections, including 693 related deaths (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017). Dromedaries are the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV (Sabir et al., 2016) . However, other animal species such as non-human primates (rhesus macaques and common marmosets), members of the family Camelidae (alpacas and llamas), rabbits and pigs have been demonstrated to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (Crameri et al., 2016; Falzarano et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2015; Vergara-Alert, van den Brand, et al., 2017; de Wit et al., 2013 de Wit et al., , 2017 . The finding that pigs can be infected with MERS-CoV would suggest that other Suidae might be susceptible to the virus. Indeed, common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) and wild boars are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing the same habitats and water sources with dromedaries (Cumming, 2008; Vergara-Alert, Vidal, Bensaid, & Segal es, 2017) . A recent study in alpacas demonstrated efficient animal-to-animal transmission (Adney, Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016) but, to our knowledge, evidence for transmission between animals from other species has not been reported. To study whether MERS-CoV might be transmitted between pigs, an experimental transmission study in this animal model was designed and performed under direct and indirect contact settings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 250, "text": "(Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 422, "end": 442, "text": "(Sabir et al., 2016)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 676, "end": 698, "text": "(Crameri et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 699, "end": 722, "text": "Falzarano et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 723, "end": 745, "text": "Haagmans et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 746, "end": 789, "text": "Vergara-Alert, van den Brand, et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 790, "end": 809, "text": "de Wit et al., 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 810, "end": 831, "text": "de Wit et al., , 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1196, "text": "(Cumming, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1245, "text": "Vergara-Alert, Vidal, Bensaid, & Segal es, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1377, "text": "(Adney, Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Hartwig, & Bowen, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "2.1 | Experimental design 3 (BSL-3) animal facilities (IRTA-CReSA, Barcelona, Spain), and divided into three groups: G1, MERS-CoV-inoculated pigs (P1-P5); G2, direct contacts (P6-P10); G3, indirect contacts (P11-P15).

However, transmission studies have only been performed in alpacas. Here, no MERS-CoV effective transmission was observed between pigs, as sustained by two main facts. First, viral RNA was detected from four of the five cohoused animals (G2), but at levels relatively similar to those found in environmental samples, and during a shorter period time than G1. Second, seroconversion was only observed in MERS-CoV-infected group pigs (G1), but specific antibodies were not detected in G2 or G3. In summary, using our pig model of MERS-CoV infection (Vergara-Alert, van den Brand, et al., 2017), we analysed animal-toanimal transmission of MERS-CoV. Although the role of Suidae in the transmission of MERS-CoV should be further clarified, unlike camelids, pigs do not seem to be able to transmit MERS-CoV efficiently, suggesting that the role of pigs as reservoir is probably negligible.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "How to cite this article: Vergara-Alert J, Raj T A B L E 1 Viral RNA from air sampling and wall surface swabbing at different times after MERS-CoV infection.
