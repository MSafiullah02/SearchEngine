The pups belonged to a litter of 11 pointers of a breeding kennel in southern Italy, 9 of which developed a fatal form of systemic infection, as resulted by the detection of CaHV-1 in internal organs (kidney, liver, lung and brain) of one of this dogs and in the vaginal swab of their mother. The two remaining animals displayed a milder form of disease, with one pup showing ocular involvement, and underwent a progressive recovery. These pups were monitored from 11 to 36 days of age, showing a long-term shedding of the virus through the nasal and ocular secretions and the faeces. CaHV-1 shedding, as assessed by means of a specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay, occurred mainly through the nasal secretions, although the pup displaying ocular disease shed the virus at high titres and for a long period even in the ocular secretions.",

            "text": "Canine alphaherpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) is an enveloped, double-strand DNA virus of the genus Varicellovirus, which is strictly related to other members of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Infection with CaHV-1 results in different clinical pictures depending on the age of infected dogs (Decaro et al., 2008) . In pregnant bitches, the virus is able to induce foetal death, abortion, mummification or stillbirth. In adult dogs CaHV-1 is responsible for genital lesions and/or ocular involvement (Evermann et al., 2011) . CaHV-1 is assuming an emerging role in the etiopathogenesis of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD), a multifactorial respiratory syndrome, which is frequently observed in densely housed environments, such as kennels and animal shelters (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007) . However, the most severe clinical forms are observed in neonatal pups that may be infected during passage through the birth canal or by contact with oronasal discharges of other dogs (Decaro et al., 2008) . As a consequence of systemic spreading of the virus, newborns develop a fatal generalized necrotizing and haemorrhagic disease, which is characterised by anorexia, dyspnoea, abdominal pain, incoordination, diarrhoea, serous or haemorrhagic nasal discharge and petechial haemorrhages on the mucous membranes (Decaro et al., 2008) . Although there are several reports of CaHV-1 neonatal infection (Decaro et al., 2002b; Larsen et al., 2015; Muro et al., 2015) , little is presently known about the extent and duration of the viral shedding by infected pups.",

The bitch was regularly vaccinated against the main canine infectious diseases (canine distemper, parvovirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, leptospirosis) and treated against ecto-and endoparasites, but she had not been administered any specific CaHV-1 vaccine. She had no problem during pregnancy and was healthy at the moment of delivery. At 2-3 days of age, 9 pups displayed signs of systemic disease, including loss of appetite, lethargy, enteritis, and respiratory distress, and died at 6-9 days after the onset of these clinical signs. Two other pups (331/16-O, 331/16-S) were only lethargic and inappetent, thus progressively improving their clinical conditions until complete recovery at 15-20 days of age. One of the surviving two pups displayed a monolateral keratitis that recovered after two weeks. One dead pup and the vaginal swab of the bitch were submitted to our laboratory for routine virological and bacteriological investigations. At necropsy, the dead pup displayed haemorrhages on the surface of the main internal organs, enlargement of the spleen and liver with scattered necrotic areas, catarrhal pneumonia and enteritis.",

Analogously, nasal shedding in young and adult dogs occurred for about 2 weeks after primary oronasal infection and for up to 32 days after corticosteroid treatment (Okuda et al., 1993) . In the present study, the nasal, ocular and faecal shedding was monitored in two pups that survived to CaHV-1 infection. Our findings demonstrated that in neonatal pups, CaHV-1 shedding occurs mainly by the nasal route, especially in the first phase of infection. However, hightitre nasal and ocular shedding was observed in the pup with ocular disease up to 31 days of age and low titres of the virus were detected up to the end of the observation period. In contrast, faecal shedding occurred at low titres in both pups. The difference of viral quantity between nasal, ocular and rectal swabs, and also the change of viral titre over time could have been partially biased by the sampling procedures (i.e., number of scraping times) and quantitation method (i.e., lack of standardisation of template volume). However, even considering some variations between the different sample types and over the time, these variations can unlikely account for the huge differences encountered in the viral DNA titres. Therefore, our findings strengthen the main role of nasal shedding for CaHV-1 transmission among neonatal pups. This is in agreement with the primary respiratory tropism of the virus observed in pups older than 2 weeks, in which CaHV-1 is able to colonise only the respiratory tract, being included among pathogens responsible for canine infectious respiratory disease (Decaro et al., 2008) .",
