Digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain are in the range of 2-18.6%, and they usually accompany respiratory symptoms (2, 3) . However, the incidence of the digestive symptoms in critical patients is up to 36-50.5% (2, 4) . Gastrointestinal system (GIS) bleeding is rare and is frequently seen in critical intensive care patients (4, 5) . In this case, we wanted to present a COVID-19 patient who was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea and was diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, with a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test positive, and normal thorax tomography. In the literature, gastrointestinal bleeding has not been reported as the first symptom of presented to the emergency department in patients with COVID-19 positive. This case is the first case reported in the literature.",

The patients stated that he presented to the emergency department due to dyspnea and epigastric pain two days before this application, and a nasal swab was taken for COVID-19, and symptomatic treatment was initiated. The patient presented to the emergency department again since his complaints did not regress, and he also had diarrhea started. The patient stated that he had no fever or cough. He had dyspnea, palpitation, and black stool. He had no recent travel outside of the state or internationally, no contact with COVID-19 (+) patient. He had no drug usage in his history except for the use of acetylsalicylic acid. The vital signs were blood pressure: 130/100 mmHg, pulse: 108 beats.min -1 , O2 saturation: 99%, respiration rate: 18 min -1 , Glasgow Coma Score: 15 (G4M6S5). The heart was rhythmic and tachycardic, sinus tachycardia and ischemia in the inferolateral derivation were recorded on the electrocardiogram. The patient was hospitalized in the private, isolated service. Pantoprazole infusion was initiated for gastrointestinal system bleeding. Hydroxychloroquine 2x400 loading and 2x200 maintenance treatments were given for five days for COVID-19 treatment. When hemoglobin level decreased to 7.2 g/dl in the control hemogram, patient had 3 units of red blood cell transfusion. The ejection fraction was 55% on the patient's echocardiography. There was no segmental and global wall motion abnormality. In his follow-up, his cardiac enzymes regressed, and his ECG did not change. Hemoglobin values did not decrease after transfusion. The patient was discharged on the 7th day of hospitalization with the recommendation of 14 days of home isolation. The nasal swab sample, which was taken 14 days after his first application, was negative.",

            "text": "Although COVID-19 patients frequently apply with the findings of the respiratory system, recent studies point out that the findings of the gastrointestinal system are also significantly observed (2, 4) . In a multicentre study in which the frequency of digestive system findings was investigated in patients with COVID-19 and 204 patients were included, GIS findings were found in 50.5% of the hospitalized patients, and the most common symptom (78.6%) was reported as a lack of appetite. However, more specific GIS symptoms such as diarrhea in 34%, vomiting in 3.9%, and abdominal pain in 1.9% were also detected. While J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 47.6% of patients with GIS symptoms had both GIS symptoms and respiratory symptoms, 2.9% (n = 6) were found to have only GIS specific symptom (2) . Our case had both dyspnea and abdominal pain with diarrhea. However, what made the case different was the condition considered as diarrhea was GIS bleeding. Because most COVID-19 GIS bleeding cases in the literature are critical ill patients (4, 5) . GIS bleeding can occur due to primary or secondary reasons. There may be gastrointestinal mucosal cell damage due to virus invasion or tissue hypoxia caused by long-term hypoxemia. It may also be due to existing coagulopathy in patients who developed multiple organ failure. Steroid, corticosteroid which used in treatment and heparin, or salicylic acid used in prophylaxis of intravascular thrombosis may also cause bleeding (4). It is difficult to say precisely whether gastrointestinal bleeding observed in our case is due to salicylic acid or COVID-19. This finding can be either coincidental or may be the result of mucosal damage caused by salicylic acid and physiological stress affecting the digestive system mucosa.",

ACE II is highly expressed in type II alveolar cells of the lung and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal system (7) . At autopsy of a patient who died due to COVID 19, histologically degeneration, necrosis, and varying degrees of mucosal spillage were detected in the gastrointestinal mucosa (8) . In the staining of pathology specimens for ACE II, positive areas were detected in gastric cytoplasm, intestinal epithelial cells, and more rarely in esophageal squamous epithelial cells. Also, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in the duodenal and rectal glandular epithelial cells in the gastric cytoplasm (9) . This finding can be an indication of a direct virus attack on the digestive system (4). Angiotensin II has a strong vasoconstrictor effect and a proinflammatory effect (10) .",
