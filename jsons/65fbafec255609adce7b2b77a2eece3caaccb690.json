            "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Until now, there are no data in the literature reporting that subjects with obesity have a higher risk of getting COVID-19; however, since obesity is known to increase the risk of developing severe forms of respiratory failure, it could be hypothesized that subjects with obesity could be at risk of serious illness if infected. In this retrospective cohort study in a single French center evaluating 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2, it has been observed that obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively, that patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) increased with BMI categories (p<0.01) and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m (85.7%). 3 As well known, obesity represents a state of low grade chronic inflammation that can contribute to the onset of metabolic diseases (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) and can modify innate and adaptive immune responses, making the immune system more vulnerable to infections and less responsive to vaccinations, antivirals and antimicrobial drugs. 4 Recent findings have highlighted the substantial impact that obesity have on immunity and pathogen defense, including the disruption of lymphoid tissue integrity; alterations in leukocyte development, phenotypes and activity; and the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses. In particular, obesity has been shown to impair memory CD8+ T cell responses to influenza virus infection, resulting in increased mortality, viral titers in lung, and worsened lung pathology. These adverse effects were associated with an obesity-induced failure to maintain influenza-specific CD8+ memory T cells, which are essential in ensuring vaccine efficacy. 5 Low-grade inflammation is determined by a condition of adipocyte hypoxia and dysfunction, that results in an exuberant secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2 and IL-6 and the recruitment of immune cells macrophage, T-cell and B-cell, creating an auto-regenerating inflammation loop. 6 Indeed increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or C-reactive protein, have been reported in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f overweight and obese adults. 7 Having so far limited scientific evidence regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity and COVID-19, some interesting information can be extrapolated from studies conducted on subjects with H1N1 infection: it has been shown that subjects with obesity compared with normal-weight individuals evince in H1N1 infection more intense IL-8 release, which is a chemokine of innate immunity involved in chemotaxis, being a major chemokine for neutrophil activation and migration into tissue, a mechanism involved in response to infection. 8 In parallel, one of the most important mechanism underlying the severity of lung disease in COVID-19 is represented by the \"cytokine storm\" which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure. It represents a phenomenon of immune hyper activation very similar to Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) typically described in the setting of T cellengaging immunotherapy and characterized by increased levels of IL-6, interferon (IFN) \u03b3 and other cytokines, causing consequences and symptoms related to immune activation, ranging from general malaise, myalgia and fever to severe organ toxicity, respiratory failure and death. 9 In support of the importance of counteracting the inflammatory response to avoid the progression of COVID-19, the use of tocilizumab in subjects with severe respiratory impairment is being tested with encouraging results. Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds the human IL-6 receptor, inhibiting its signal transduction, currently used for rheumatoid arthritis, but its efficacy has also been demonstrated against other forms of lung immune-related pneumopathy. 10 Whereas, considering that subjects with obesity have a proinflammatory milieu, it is expected that COVID-19 could further exacerbate inflammation exposing them to higher levels of circulating inflammatory molecules compared to lean human subjects. This could explain the increased risk of severe complications of COVID-19 for subjects with obesity.",

Regarding T2DM, four risk factors for diabetic patients with COVID-19, compared to COVID patients without diabetes were proposed, which can increase the risk of poor outcomes: susceptibility to hyperglycemia from corticosteroid therapy, inadequate glycemic control, lack of contact with healthcare professionals and inappropriate discontinuation of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which individually or synergistically could justify the worst prognosis in the patients with T2DM and COVID- 19. 11 In fact, it has also been questioned that ACE inhibitors or ARBs, usually used as treatment for hypertension, could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, since they increase the expression of ACE 2 whose receptor is used by the virus SARS-CoV-2 to enter into the host cell. 12 However, currently there are no sufficient data to support this hypothesis and therefore",

As well-known obesity per se is associated to a blunted composition of gut microbiome that in turn is paramount for the regulation of the host's immune system and for the protection from infection. Moreover, gut microbiome also has a role in attenuating the damage consequent to infection. In fact some protocols for the treatment of COVID-19 include the use of probiotics to maintain the balance of intestinal microecology and therefore indirectly strengthen immune system. 24, 25 Finally, subjects with obesity have also mechanical issues related to excessive weight that make difficult an early diagnosis with pulmonary ultrasound and thus leading to a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the advanced stage which is most associated to highest mortality. The lack of medical or intensive care units not designed to accommodate patients with severe obesity, the difficulties of intubation and insertion of catheters related to excess of weight may lead to a slowdown in therapeutic steps, worsening prognosis in patients with obesity and COVID-19.",

Following a rapid spread in China, new outbreaks occurred in northern Italy and in several European countries. On March 12th 2020 WHO announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 results in a respiratory infection characterized by mild to severe symptoms such as dry cough, fever and difficulty breathing which can appear up to about 14 days after exposure to the virus. According to National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) high-risk categories for severe illness from COVID-19 are people aged 65 years and older, who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, immunocompromised, or people with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including chronic lung diseases, serious heart conditions, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, liver diseases, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher).",
