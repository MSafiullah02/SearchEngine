The discharge criteria were; 1: afebrile for more than 3 days, 2: significant improvement of respiratory symptoms, and 3: improvement in the imaging abnormalities on the chest.

All these alterations further explained that COVID-19 may exert a potential effect on lymphocytes, especially T cells. COVID-19 outbreaks and invades via lung mucosa stimulates inflammation cascades, and motivates cytokine storm, resulting in alteration in immune response such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. Hence, intravenous immunoglobulin was applied in most subjects with reduced WBC and lymphocyte count [8] . Augmented serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have also been documented, associating with the severity of the disease. Nevertheless elevated interleukin-10 levels, which is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, indicates a diverse pattern from that of SARS-CoV infection [14] . Some patients showed increased liver enzymes, and glucose levels and few patients exhibited abnormal muscle enzymes. Liver test abnormality of COVID-19 may not be induced by liver cell damage but by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons [8] . In summary, blood routine test, CRP, PCT, coagulation function, arterial blood gas, and tissue function tests (e.g. transaminases, bilirubin, myocardial enzyme, creatinine, urea nitrogen, urine volume, etc.) as tabulated in Table 3 should be monitored in patients [17] . Furthermore, subjects having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected, particularly for cases with close contact or exposure history [18] .",

Lung imaging shows the severity of COVID-19 disease therefore physicians should be informed about radiological reports. Clinical findings from COVID-19-infected cases with a high abnormality on the CT scan who were admitted to the ICU [16] exhibited that patients on admission frequently showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral multiple lobular, whereas CT reports from non-ICU patients showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) [15] . In severe infection, imaging can confirm heterogeneous consolidation with GGOs in bilateral lungs and bronchiectasis, indicating as \"white lung\" when most lobes of the lung are affected [19] . Furthermore, COVID-19 cases might show intralobular septal thickening and bilateral pleura along with little pleural effusion [13] . CT scan enables recognition of the initial phase of respiratory infection and provides opportunity for a quick public health care response [20] . Slice chest CT has been shown as the main evidence for approved findings. Since chest radiography is not sensitive for the diagnosis of GGO and might show normal results in the initial stage of disease [20] , it is not considered as the first-line imaging method for COVID-19. Nevertheless, bilateral multifocal consolidation can be observed in severe cases, partially fused into high consolidation with minor pleural effusions and even showing with \"white lung\" [13] . In this respect, the thin slice chest CT test is more useful for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [18, 20] . Highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) will be easier to detect GGOs in the early stage [4] .",

In the respiratory system, local lung RAS activation can influence the pathogenesis of lung damage through numerous mechanisms, including elevation of vascular permeability and changes in alveolar epithelial cells. In this cascade, renin increases angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I (Ang I, a decapeptide hormone) [29] . The ACE hydrolyzes Ang I to angiotensin II. The angiotensins II binds to its receptors and induces vasoactive effects. ACE2 catalyzes Ang I to generate angiotensin-(1-9) and Ang II to Ang-(1-7), and antagonize several effects of Ang II. ACE2, by reducing local Ang II levels, acts as a counter-regulatory enzyme [29, 30] . ACE2 deficiency and consequent high Ang II concentration, lead to increased vascular permeability, neutrophil accumulation, pulmonary oedema, disruption of gas exchange, and exacerbation in lung function. On the other hand, active recombinant ACE2 protein alleviates ALI symptoms in ACE2 knockout animals [31] . In the lungs, RAS activity is basically high, and the activity of the ACE2 is also highly increased to control the balance of Ang II/Ang-(1-7)",

Since Covid-19 quickly spread through respiratory droplets, head and neck surgeons who have close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract are principally at high risk. Given the high number of surgeries done worldwide, it is essential for the surgeons and surgical team to be adequately protected from coronavirus transmission. In the COVID-19 patients who need surgery, risks versus benefits of the procedure for the patient should be cautiously evaluated. The surgeon may temporary postpone an emergency or urgent surgery on cases that show coronavirus symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever). For all suspected cases that are undergoing operation, chest CT and blood tests need to be checked before admission. The surgical team can also order an inhouse RT-PCR assay within 24h. If the subject's condition does not allow for a 24h wait, the patient is assumed to be COVID-19-positive. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, non-operative management is preferred. If surgery is essential in these subjects, suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used (Fig. 5) . Furthermore they should remove their PPE and place the PPE in a labelled waste bag in an anteroom. There are various levels of emergency related to COVID-19 patient needs, and assessment is required to distinguish among them.

Pathogenesis of coronavirus is an extremely complex process, and much of the required details in host-pathogen interaction remained unknown. Discovering the useful medicine options for the treatment of the COVID-19 outbreak is vital [36, 37] (Table   7) . There are various possible treatment approaches [29] including (i) rises in ACE2 expression by injection of soluble recombinant ACE2 protein or using therapeutic vectors expressing high levels of ACE2 which may be applicable in the future [38] , (ii) using specific ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, and (iii) inhibiting Ang II receptors. In particular, the type I Ang II receptor has been reported to promote disease by motivating oedemas and disturbing lung function [38] . Hence, a type I Ang II receptor blocker (e.g., losartan) has been successively examined for improving COVID-19 pneumonia [29] . Treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 probably acts as a competitive interceptor of coronavirus by inhibiting binding of the viral particle to the ACE2 receptor, consequently can slow coronavirus entry into the cells and protect the lung injury. Remdesivir (adenosine analogue) that is used for the treatment of the Ebola disease is incorporated in the nascent chains of viral RNA, causing premature termination.

In the patient with SARS cases treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin had a lower risk of ARDS or death as compared with ribavirin alone [49] . Beck [50] . The host immune system is one of the main factors in secondary infections. Other involved factors that may increase mortality in COVID-19 patients are obesity, old age, diabetics, HIV infection, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy in women [50] . Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment of these critical patients to prevent secondary infection are necessary. Immunoglobulin injection is recommended to increase the antiinfection drug ability for severe cases [50] . Furthermore, paracetamol (400mg per time, every 8 h when required) is recommended in the patient with high temperature [9, 37] .",
