Recently, there have been substantial changes in our understanding and approach to theses diseases. With greater comprehension of the clinical relevance of the different histopathological subgroups that make up the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, the term idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is now reserved to patients with idiopathic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on surgical lung biopsy. The following review will provide an updated discussion of the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, natural history, morbidity and mortality, prognosis, and conventional therapy of IPF, as well as emerging strategies for the treatment of patients with this disease.",

In a population-based study in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, the prevalence for adults from age 35 to 44 yr was 2.7 per 100,000, but surpassed 175 per 100,000 for individuals older than 75 yr (3). The prevalence of IPF is higher in men (20.2 cases per 100,000) than in women (13.2 cases per 100,000) (3). The estimated prevalence in the United States is between 35,000 and 55,000 cases (3).",

In Japan, the mortality rate for IPF per 100,000 population was estimated to be 3.3 in men and 2.5 in women, with an overall rate of 3.0 in both sexes (4). In the United Kingdom, the annual number of deaths from IPF increased twofold between 1979 and 1988. The age-adjusted rate of pulmonary fibrosis among deceased in the United States increased from 48.6 per 100,000 in 1979 to 50.9 per 100,000 in 1991 in males, and from 21.4 per 100,000 in 1979 to 27.2 per 100,000 in 1991 in females (7). Pulmonary fibrosis listed as a cause of death increased from 40% in 1979 to 56% in 1991. In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rates are highest in the western and southwestern states and lowest in the midwest and northeast. In the United Kingdom, highest mortality rates are found in industrialized areas of England and Wales (7,8).",

Smokers of 21 to 40 pack-years have an OR of 2.3 (95% CI 1.3\u20133.8) for pulmonary fibrosis (9). In a recent study in Japan, the adjusted odds ratio for cigarette smoking was estimated at 5.40 (95% CI 2.30\u201312.66) (11). Interestingly, three studies reported improved survival among current or former smokers with UIP compared to never-smokers (12\u201314). However, others found no such effect (15\u201317). It is possible that the apparent protective effect of cigarette smoking may relate to the following: lead time bias; alterations in the balance of proteinases and antiproteinases that would influence net deposition of extracellular matrix in the lung; or inhibitory effects of cigarette smoke on lung fibroblast proliferation and chemotaxis (12,18).",

Small tracheobronchial aspirations of gastric acid may play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF; however, a causal relationship has not been established (19,20). Investigators at the University of Washington Medical Center are conducting an ongoing prospective study of 65 patients with IPF. Interim results indicate that the prevalence of IPF patients with GERD is 95%, with only 40% of patients reporting symptoms (19).

A serological survey found an association between active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and IPF (23). Egan and colleagues reported immunohistochemical evidence of EBV-productive cycle antigens in type II alveolar epithelial cells in IPF (24). Subsequently, these investigators detected EBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the lung tissue of patients with IPF (25). Further study demonstrated that productive EBV replication is common in IPF and it is not associated with immunosuppressive therapy (26). Tang and co-workers detected one or more of four herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus [CMV], EBV, human herpesvirus 7 [HH-7], and human herpesvirus 8 [HHV-8]) in 97% of patients with IPF and 36% of controls, suggesting that a herpesvirus could be a source of chronic antigenic stimulation in IPF (27). Relatively high prevalence of serum antibodies to hepatitis C was demonstrated in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, but this finding was not confirmed in other studies (28\u201330). Adenovirus DNA was found in transbronchial lung biopsies (TBBx) from patients with IPF, and it was more prevalent in IPF patients treated with corticosteroids (67%) than in those who were not (10%), suggesting that this virus may newly infect or reactivate following corticosteroid therapy (31). A higher incidence of influenza (32\u201334), parainfluenza (35,36), CMV (37), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (38), measles (39), herpes simplex virus-6, Mycoplasma, and Legionella has been reported in IPF (23,24,30,40).",

Patient age at disease onset is generally between 50 and 70 yr of age and IPF is more common in males than females. IPF typically presents insidiously, with gradual onset of a nonproductive cough and dyspnea (2). Patients are often treated for other conditions such as congestive heart failure, \u201cwalking pneumonia,\u201d bronchitis, or asthma before the diagnosis is made. The physical examination in most patients (>80%) reveals fine bibasilar inspiratory crackles (\u201cVelcro rales\u201d), and clubbing is noted in up to 50% of patients (51,52). Signs of right heart failure are evident in advanced cases (2).",

One early study described \u201cautoimmune factors\u201d in blood of 8 patients (4 of whom had autoimmune-associated diseases) among 17 patients with diffuse fibrosing alveolitis (53). A positive rheumatoid factor occurred in 3 of 20 patients with unexplained pulmonary fibrosis and positive antinuclear factor in the serum (ANA) (54). A later study examined serum specimens from 122 patients with IPF and compared them with specimens from age- and sex-matched controls; ANAs were present in 21% of patients with IPF and in 6% of the control subjects (55). Positive circulating ANAs or rheumatoid factor occur in 10% to 20% of patients with IPF, but titers are rarely high (2,53,54,56). An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, or hypergammaglobulinemia may be found in patients with IPF, but are nondiagnostic (2). Serological findings do not correlate with extent or severity of disease, and have no prognostic value (2,57). In the absence of symptoms of connective tissue disease, the presence of autoantibodies does not imply an underlying systemic disorder. Recently, investigators reported the occurrence of low fasting triglyceride and high free fatty acid levels in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Because insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is known to lower triglycerides and increase free fatty acids, the authors hypothesized that the reported increased production of IGF-I in patients with IPF may explain such findings (58).",

Several studies have shown that experienced radiologists can make a \u201cconfident\u201d diagnosis of UIP with specificity greater than 95%, provided CT features are typical (65,69\u201372). Although a characteristic HRCT is highly specific for IPF/UIP, \u201ctypical\u201d HRCT identifies only 37 to 67% of patients with histological UIP; therefore, a surgical lung biopsy (SLB) is recommended when clinical and radiological information result in an uncertain diagnosis (14,65,70,73). One study evaluated the proficiency of physicians with expertise in interstitial lung diseases to identify accurately the HRCT scans from patients with biopsy-proven IPF/UIP. When these investigators made a \u201cconfident\u201d diagnosis of IPF based on HRCT scan and clinical data, they were right in more than 80% of the cases. However, more than half of the patients with IPF had an uncertain diagnosis on the basis of HRCT and clinical assessment (70). In a subsequent analysis of these data, investigators identified HRCT features associated with a pathological diagnosis of UIP. On multivariate analysis, lower lobe honeycombing (OR, 5.36), and upper-lung irregular lines (OR, 6.28) were the only independent predictors of UIP. When they combined those two factors, a diagnosis of UIP was established with a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 81%, and a positive predictive value of 85% (65). Interestingly, in that study, adenopathy was observed in 55% and 21% of patients with UIP and without UIP, respectively. This finding suggests that patients with IPF generate a marked lymphoproliferative response to an unknown antigen or antigens; we believe that this observation requires further investigation as it may provide important clues to further our understanding of the pathogenesis the disease. In a separate study, two radiologists independently assessed CT scans from a cohort of patients with either UIP. CT features were \u201ctypical\u201d for UIP in only 37% patients, and all of them had histological UIP on SLB. Typical CT features of UIP are associated with advanced, latestage disease. Among patients with earlier phases of UIP, CT features may be atypical (74) or indeterminate (69).",

BALF is useful in research studies but of limited clinical application when evaluating IIPs (85). Increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, alveolar macrophages, and countless cytokines are noted in BALF from patients with IPF/UIP; lymphocyte numbers are usually normal (2). BALF neutrophilia is present in 67 to 90% of patients with IPF/CFA (86,87), but does not predict prognosis or therapeutic responsiveness. Elevations in BALF eosinophils were associated with more severe clinical impairment (86,87), but BALF eosinophil counts do not correlate consistently with prognosis (86,87). By contrast, the presence of BALF lymphocytosis, found in fewer than 15% of cases, was associated with a greater responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy, a more cellular biopsy, and less honeycombing (86,87). Data compiled from two studies documented favorable responses to corticosteroids in 12 of 13 patients exhibiting BALF lymphocytosis, but in only 4 of 37 without lymphocytosis (86,87). Because the studies citing BALF lymphocytosis in steroid-responsive patients with IPF (87) or CFA (86) antedated the description of NSIP, it is possible that BALF lymphocytosis reflects disorders distinct from UIP (such as cellular NSIP). Nevertheless, in a recent study, researchers hypothesized that BALF findings may distinguish between UIP and NSIP; BALF total and differential cell counts were not different between the two groups, and in neither group, were BALF findings predictive of survival or changes in lung function (88).",

Importantly, in that study, UIP in at least one lobe defined prognosis (94). In a later study, the pathological findings in biopsy and subsequent explant specimens from 20 patients with UIP were reviewed to refine histological criteria and to assess the relationship between UIP and NSIP. The important new finding was that NSIP-like areas were present in the majority of UIP patients (80%) in both biopsy and explants specimens, and in some, these areas were extensive, making accurate diagnosis of UIP difficult (cases were misdiagnosed as NSIP). The most useful feature for diagnosing UIP in difficult cases is the presence of a distinct \u201cpatchwork\u201d or variegated pattern of parenchymal involvement (95).",

This is not surprising, as pathologically, these lesions are characterized by varying degrees of intra-alveolar and/or peribronchial pigmented macrophage infiltration with scant or no fibrosis. AIP is characterized by active fibrosis consisting of proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with minimal collagen deposition resembling the organizing stage of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (92). Finally within the IIPs, some include COP (previously termed bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, or BOOP), and LIP. Both are relatively steroid-responsive lesions; pathologically, COP is characterized by the presence of intra-alveolar plugs of granulation tissue, and LIP by lymphocytic infiltration of the alveolar walls. It should be noted, however, that many experts argue that LIP should not be included within the IIPs because it is considered as lymphoproliferative disorder which, in turn, is rarely idiopathic and is mostly observed in association with infections (e.g., HIV) or collagen vascular diseases (CVDs) (75).",

Moreover, the description supports the notion that the lesions are not homogeneous for both the timing of the orginal injury and the subsequent response to the injury and repair. In addition, the histopathological entity of UIP is not unique to IPF, and can be found in patients with connective tissue diseases, end-stage asbestosis, and end-stage hypersensitivity pneumonia. Therefore, UIP may represent an end-stage of a \u201cprocess,\u201d not the beginning, intermediate, and end-stage of a disease.

This concept was challenged in a recent study of subcutaneous interferon (IFN)-\u03b31b (200 \u00b5g thrice weekly) in 330 patients with mild to moderate IPF (forced vital capacity [FVC] > 50% and DLCO > 30%), where a trend toward lower mortality was seen in IFN-\u03b31b-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (96). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in lung function or gas exchange between IFN-\u03b31b-treated and placebo-treated patients at 48 wk of follow-up. In both study groups, 70% of patients remained stable, 25% deteriorated, and the rest improved, suggesting that most patients with mild to moderate IPF remain stable for at least 1 yr on no specific therapy. The so-called \u201cIPF exacerbations\u201d may explain the trend toward lower mortality seen in this study, but this requires further study. IPF exacerbations may be defined as an accelerated deterioration of IPF in the absence of apparent infectious agents and heart failure (97,98). It is often a terminal event, with features of DAD or organizing pneumonia on lung biopsy or autopsy (99,100). This syndrome is indistinguishable from idiopathic AIP (101), and is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The factors responsible for this accelerated phase of IPF are unknown, but viral infections, high concentrations of oxygen, or drug reactions are plausible etiological factors (101).",

Investigators from the University of Michigan evaluated the impact of histological diagnosis, baseline clinical, physiological, and radiographical factors on survival in 168 patients with suspected IIP. The presence of histological UIP was the most important risk factor for mortality (risk ratio [RR] of 28.46 [95% CI 5.5\u2013148]), followed by the presence of honeycombing on HRCT, a radiographic feature that was shown to be a good surrogate for histological UIP (sensitivity of 90%, and a specificity of 86%) (14). The same group evaluated the impact of HRCT appearance on survival in patients with IIP. Patients with histological UIP and stereotypical HRCT appearance of UIP had a shorter survival (median survival 2.08 yr) when compared with patients with histological UIP and indeterminate HRCT scans (median survival 5.76 yr) (69).",

King and co-workers studied 238 patients with IPF/UIP and derived a clinical-radiological-physiological (CRP) scoring system using clinical (age, smoking status, clubbing), radiographical (extent of interstitial opacities, presence of pulmonary hypertension on chest radiographs), and physiological parameters (reduced lung volume, abnormal gas exchange during maximal exercise). These investigators demonstrated that the CRP score correlated with important histopathological findings and was helpful in predicting survival in patients with IPF. A second abbreviated CRP scoring system that excluded PaO2 during maximal exercise was inferior in predicting survival (12,114). Similarly, investigators from the Brompton Hospital devised a composite physiological index (CPI) using radiographical and physiological information that predicted mortality more accurately than individual PFT in patients with IPF (115). Even though these composite scoring systems are accurate in their predictive ability, they are expensive and cumbersome to generate in clinical practice. With this in mind, the prognostic value of oxygen desaturation during a 6-min walking test was evaluated in patients with IPF. Desaturation defined as a fall in oxygen saturation to 88% or less during the 6-min walk test identified patients with higher mortality compared with patients who did not desaturate. The 4-yr survival rate of IPF patients who desaturated to that level was 34.5% compared with 69.1% in patients who did not desaturate (84).",

In a separate study, investigators concluded that at 6 and 12 mo of follow-up, serial pulmonary function trends (change in DLCO, FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1], and the CPI) provided important prognostic information in IPF (117). A third study showed that assessment of changes in clinical and physiological variables (dyspnea score, total lung capacity, thoracic gas volume, FVC, FEV1, DLCO, pO2, oxygen saturation, and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient) at 6 and 12 mo provide clinicians with more accurate prognostic information than baseline values alone (118).",

Large retrospective studies of patients with IPF showed no survival benefit with CS (12; 15,123,128). In one retrospective study from England, survival was worse among IPF patients treated with CS or CP, although this likely reflects a selection bias (15). Given the potential severe toxicities associated with CS (105,124), recent international consensus statements argue that high-dose CS should not be used to treat IPF (2,61). However, because anecdotal responses to CS are occasionally noted in patients with IPF/UIP (14), these statements acknowledge that selected patients with clinical or physiological impairment or worsening PFTs should be treated (2,61). Both statements (2,61) advocate an individualized approach to treating IPF/UIP. Among patients requiring treatment, both statements recommend combining therapy with either oral AZA or CP plus low-dose prednisone or prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg [lean body weight per d] for 4 wk, then 0.25 mg/kg for 8 wk, then 0.125 mg/kg). This represents a substantial departure from earlier regimens advocating high-dose prednisone (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg/d for \u22656\u201312 wk) (114,125,126). Combined therapy should be continued for 6 mo in the absence of adverse effects. Treatment should be continued beyond 6 or 12 mo or later time points only if patients improve or remain stable. It should be emphasized that these recommendations (2,61) reflect expert opinion, but have not been validated in clinical trials. We believe CS should not be given to patients at high risk for adverse effects (e.g., age > 70 yr, osteoporosis, DM, extreme obesity, and so on).",

At that point, AZA (3 mg/kg/d) was added and both agents were continued for an additional 9 mo or longer. Twelve patients (60%) responded. The independent effect of AZA was difficult to assess, because all patients received prednisone concomitantly. In a second, double-blind trial, Raghu and associates compared the effect of AZA plus prednisone on lung function with that of prednisone alone in previously untreated patients with IPF (the study population may have included patients with IIP other than UIP). Forty-three percent of patients randomly assigned to AZA plus prednisone died during the 9-yr follow-up period, compared with 77% of patients randomly assigned to prednisone alone. The difference became statistically significant only after adjustment for age (p = 0.02) (126).",

In one 6-mo trial, 28 patients with \u201cmid-course\u201d IPF were randomized to prednisone alone (n = 16); prednisone plus oral CP (1.5 mg/kg/d) (n = 9); or CP alone (n = 5) (129). Mean BALF neutrophil counts declined in the cohort receiving CP, but PFTs did not change in any group. Johnson and colleagues compared the effect of prednisolone alone with that of prednisolone plus CP on breathlessness, radiographic appearance, and lung function in patients with IPF (the study population included patients with CVD and with IIP other than UIP). Initial improvement occurred in 7 of the 22 patients in the prednisolone-only group and in 5 of the 21 patients in the CP plus prednisolone group. However, at 36 mo, only 2 of the 22 patients in the prednisolone-only group remained improved, and only 1 of the 21 patients in the CP-prednisolone group remained improved. Life-table analysis suggested better survival in patients in the CP-prednisolone group, but this was not statistically significant (127). In a prospective uncontrolled study, Zisman and associates studied the efficacy of CP in 19 patients with biopsyproven UIP who were unresponsive or intolerant to CS therapy. Only 1 patient improved; 7 remained stable, and 11 deteriorated. Nearly two-thirds of the patients developed drug-related side effects and one half of the patients discontinued therapy due to intolerable side effects (108). Intermittent, intravenous \u201cpulse\u201d CP, administered every 2 to 4 wk, has been tried for IPF refractory to CS in nonrandomized studies, but benefit was not convincing (130\u2013132).",

Two-year survival following single lung transplant (SLT) ranges from 60 to 80%; 5-yr survival is 40 to 60% (134\u2013136). In one study, lung transplantation reduced the risk of death by 75% (135). In addition, patients surviving lung transplantation appear to achieve considerable improvement in most dimensions of health-related quality of life (137\u2013139). Unfortunately, owing to a shortage of donor organs, waiting time may be prolonged (up to 2\u20133 yr) and many patients with IPF die while awaiting transplantation (134,135). One study evaluated baseline PFT and HRCT fibrosis scores and the relationship to 2-yr survival in patients with IPF younger than 65 yr of age; the optimal points on the receiving operator characteristics (ROC) curves for discriminating between survivors and nonsurvivors corresponded to a combination of DLCO of 39% predicted with HRCT-fibrosis score of 2.25 (110). In a separate study, investigators reviewed all transplant referrals for IIP that were listed for lung transplantation at their center. The aim of the study was to determine a parameter that would discriminate between patients who survived and patients who died awaiting transplantation. The severity of hypoxemia at rest was the only significant difference between both groups (140). Unless contraindications exist, patients with severe functional impairment (e.g., FVC <60% predicted, DLCO <40% predicted), oxygen dependency, and a deteriorating course refractory to medical therapy should be listed promptly for transplantation (133,134).",

It is known to bind microtubular proteins necessary for intracellular trafficking and cellular mitosis, thus adversely affecting secretion of proteins from cells and cellular proliferation (142,143). Its antifibrotic activity was described following the discovery that colchicine inhibits secretion of collagen and other important growth factors necessary for fibroblast proliferation (144). However, further studies (145) with or without additional therapeutic agents, such as steroids, failed to document efficacy of colchicine in the treatment of human pulmonary fibrosis. It is thus not currently recommended for use in therapy of IPF.",

            "text": "In a prospective open-label study, Raghu and colleagues (152) treated 54 (42 biopsy-proven) consecutive patients with pirfenidone who were either unwilling to receive or unresponsive to conventional therapy. Survival rates of 78% at 1 yr and 63% at 2 yr compared favorably with historical controls. In addition, 83% of patients discontinued prednisone therapy and the remaining 17% were able to reduce their daily dose. All patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy tolerated discontinuation of the drug. Interestingly, patients whose lung function had deteriorated before enrollment appeared to stabilize after beginning pirfenidone. Side effects were relatively common, with patients reporting nausea (44%), fatigue (44%), and photosensitivity (24%). Despite these encouraging observations, the results of this study are difficult to interpret owing to the lack of appropriate controls, incomplete pre-entry and follow-up pulmonary function test data, a small study population, and a bias associated with survivorship effect (pulmonary function data of patients who died were not included in the analysis, and this could have biased the results). Furthermore, the observed steroid- and immunosuppressive-sparing effects of pirfenidone may have simply reflected lack of efficacy of conventional therapy rather than a true effect of pirfenidone. In a second open-label trial, Japanese investigators evaluated oral pirfenidone in eight patients with IPF and two with diffuse lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis; after 1 yr of therapy, there was no change in chest radiographic scores and arterial oxygen tension; the drug was well tolerated (153). Early treatment with pirfenidone appears to slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (154). A randomized-controlled trial focusing on early treatment is warranted to test the efficacy and safety of this agent in IPF.",

            "text": "IFNs play an integral role in the regulation of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, but the mechanism by which they exert their effect is not clearly understood. Recent observations have shown that IFN-\u03b3 has antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, and antifibrotic effects (155), and thus may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IPF. IFN-\u03b3 decreases collagen content in the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 transcription and subsequent procollagen mRNA production (156). In addition, IFN-\u03b3 inhibits fibroblast proliferation in cultures derived from normal and fibrotic human lung, making an argument that IFN-\u03b3 may have therapeutic applications (157). Lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 have been found in patients with IPF compared with patients with less fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary sarcoidosis (158). Kuroki and associates (159) measured levels of type III collagen in patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis and found an inverse correlation with IFN-\u03b3 levels, particularly in patients with IPF. These studies suggest that patients with IPF may have a defect in IFN-\u03b3 production or function, which predisposes them to develop fibrosis following injury. However, the potential for developing fibrosis is not likely to be dependent on one factor; rather it is likely the result of a complex interplay of fibrotic mediators, differential gene expression, and feedback mechanisms. A study by Shaw and colleagues (160) showed that alveolar macrophages from patients with interstitial lung disease had increased production of platelet-derived growth factor, which is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts. This increase in platelet-derived growth factor was upregulated following treatment with IFN-\u03b3, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 may act to potentiate fibrosis in certain cellular environments.",

A randomized, prospectively controlled trial was conducted in 18 patients with IPF comparing IFN-\u03b31b and low-dose prednisolone with prednisolone alone for 12 mo (161). The results were remarkable in that patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis treated with IFN-\u03b31b plus lowdose prednisolone demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function, whereas those who received prednisolone alone experienced further decline in pulmonary function. The authors showed that all patients treated had almost undetectable levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA, and increased levels of both TGF-\u03b2 and connective tissue growth factor mRNA in lung tissue. Furthermore, after treatment with IFN-\u03b31b, transcription of TGF-\u03b2 and connective tissue growth factor were both significantly decreased. Several concerns have been raised regarding the findings reported by Ziesche and co-workers (162), particularly the unexpectedly good results with IFN-\u03b31b. To address some of the issues raised, an outside panel of experts reanalyzed the study data by reviewing each patient\u2019s lung function studies, CT scans, and SLBs to assess the clinical course and diagnosis of IPF according to the International Consensus Statement (2,163). Fifteen of 18 patients had either definite (n = 9) or probable (n = 6) IPF. The panel reanalyzed treatment response using published criteria and eliminated the patients who definitely did not have IPF. Patients treated with IFN-\u03b31b plus low-dose prednisolone demonstrated either stability or improvement in pulmonary function and gas exchange after 1 yr of treatment, whereas treatment with prednisolone alone was associated with no improvement in all patients (163). The observed benefit of IFN-\u03b31b on lung function has not been reproduced in subsequent studies. In one retrospective uncontrolled observation of 21 patients with IPF treated with IFN-\u03b31b, only one patient experienced objective improvement, 7 discontinued therapy (owing to lack of perceived benefit), and 11 died after 6 mo of therapy (164). In a separate study of five patients with IPF treated with IFN-\u03b31b, only one patient improved, two discontinued treatment owing to adverse effects and decline in lung function, and one died after 3 mo of therapy (165).",

            "text": "The prior discussion has centered on fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition as two areas of therapeutic intervention. It is becoming more apparent that the fibrotic process has multiple pathogenetic mechanisms. One of the fundamental hypotheses of pulmonary fibrosis involves an imbalanced response to injury, in which the capacity of the alveolar epithelium to repair itself is compromised, ultimately leading to fibrosis. Some investigators propose that the alveolar epithelium itself has antifibrotic properties, and that chronic loss of alveolar epithelium leads to an environment conducive to the development of fibrosis (172). Support for this notion exists in the fact that induction of apoptosis of alveolar epithelium has been shown to occur following administration of bleomycin (173). Therapies that either inhibit epithelial injury or enhance repair may limit the fibrotic response. In this regard, captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor widely used in clinical practice, may have a role in the treatment of IPF. In vitro, captopril inhibits fibroblast proliferation, and in models of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, it has been shown to reduce alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and fibroproliferation. In addition, captopril abrogates Fas-induced apoptosis in human alveolar epithelial cells (141,174). There is currently an ongoing clinical trial at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico testing the efficacy of captopril in patients with IPF (141).",

This oxidant burden is thought to be a consequence of both increased levels of reactive oxygen species and a defective antioxidant response. A major protector of oxidant-induced injury of the alveolar epithelium is glutathione, which has been shown to be deficient in the BALF of patients with IPF (176). Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor for glutathione synthesis, may augment the antioxidant defense system and protect the alveolar epithelium from free radical-induced injury (177). In vivo, Hagiwara and associates (178) reported a significant inhibition of bleomycininduced lung fibrosis in mice following aerosolized NAC during the early inflammatory phase of injury. Whether this effect was secondary to NAC inhibition of cellular inflammation, or its role as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, is not clear. German investigators evaluated oral NAC as a strategy to augment lung glutathione levels in 17 patients with biopsy-proven IPF. Following therapy with NAC, glutathione levels in BALF were significantly increased compared with pretreatment levels (177). In a separate study, Behr and colleagues (179) prospectively studied 18 patients with IPF and assessed the redox balance of the lung and changes in lung function following high-dose NAC therapy for 12 wk. They reported an increase in the total and reduced form of glutathione concentration in the BALF, and significant improvement in pulmonary function. The authors suggest that NAC may be considered as an adjunct in the treatment of IPF. Currently, there is a clinical trial in Europe to evaluate the potential benefits of NAC in IPF.",

Given the temporal heterogeneity of the UIP lesion, early histopathological abnormalities may be present even in patients with advanced IPF. If early cytokine release is relevant to the initiation of this pathogenic response, then the targeting of early cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 should be considered. TNF-\u03b1 appears to be upregulated soon after bleomycin-induced injury and has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory processes (180). Sime and colleagues (181) showed that transient overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 in rat lung led to fibrosis associated with concomitant TGF-\u03b2 expression and proliferation of myofibroblasts (181). Furthermore, upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 expression has been shown to occur in inbred murine strains that are sensitive to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, with similar expression being absent in resistant strains (180). In addition, Ortiz and colleagues (182) showed that TNF receptor-deficient mice did not develop pulmonary fibrosis following exposure to bleomycin despite increased TNF expression. Studies of human lung biopsy specimens of patients with IPF have shown an upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and protein (183). These observations along with other studies in animal models demonstrating abrogation of pulmonary fibrosis following treatment with soluble TNF receptors suggest that TNF-\u03b1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (184). Several agents that can block TNF-\u03b1 are now available for human use (185). There is currently an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of etanercept, a TNF-\u03b1 receptor antagonist, in patients with IPF.",

Arai and colleagues (188) investigated the possible inhibitory effects of IL-10 by introducing the IL-10 gene into mice exposed to bleomycin and found that bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was suppressed. These results suggest that treatment with IL-10 during the early inflammatory phases of lung injury may be promising and requires further investigation. Concerns regarding the role of this agent in treating pulmonary fibrosis exist in that IL-10 is a type-2 Th (Th2) cytokine that could suppress IFN-\u03b3 expression and promote fibrogenesis (189).

Analysis of subset populations of Th cells within the interstitium of patients with IPF reveal a predominantly Th2-type pattern of cytokine production, suggesting that alterations in T-cell subpopulations of Th1 and Th2 cells and their associated pattern of cytokine production may contribute to progression of IPF (190). Supporting evidence comes from studies demonstrating that IFN-\u03b3 (a Th1 cytokine) has profound antifibrotic effects in IPF possibly because it shifts the balance away from a Th2-dependent profibrotic environment. Thus, it seems reasonable to target therapy to correct the Th imbalance by either favoring a Th1 phenotype or abrogating the predominant Th2 response (e.g., administration of IL-12 to promote IFN-\u03b3 expression, or inhibition of IL-4, IL-13, and so on).",

In addition, MCP-1 has been shown to stimulate pulmonary fibroblasts, TGF-\u03b2 synthesis, and collagen production (198). Analysis of serum, BALF, and lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF reveal increased levels of this chemokine (196,197,199). Furthermore, serum MCP-1 levels correlate with clinical course in patients with interstitial lung disease (199). Further investigation into the clinical significance of MCP-1 and its contribution into the pathogenesis of IPF are necessary, and may provide the groundwork for novel therapies.",

            "text": "Another potential mediator of fibrosis produced in a variety of cells in the lung is the vasoactive peptide endothelin (ET)-1 (200,201). First thought to be primarily a vasoactive agent, ET-1 has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation, activate monocytes, induce collagen production, and regulate cytokine production (202). Mutsaers and colleagues (203) revealed that ET-1 levels are augmented following administration of bleomycin with increased localization of the agent in areas of fibrosis. With increases in ET-1 synthesis following TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, one may speculate that ET-1 may play an important role in the cascade of events leading to pulmonary fibrosis (204,205). Additional support for its role in pulmonary fibrosis comes from studies in animals in which fibrosis was attenuated following treatment with bosentan, an ET receptor antagonist (206). ET-1 has also been associated with pulmonary fibrosis in humans. In a study examining the expression of ET-1 in patients with interstitial lung fibrosis, Giaid and associates (200) found a striking expression of ET-1 in lung tissue that correlated with parameters of disease activity in patients with IPF. There is currently an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of bosentan in patients with IPF.",
