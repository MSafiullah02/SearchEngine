On 24 April 2003, the hospital was hastily closed after recognizing an ongoing widespread nosocomial outbreak of SARS among health care workers and patients. All patients, visitors, and health care workers were quarantined, and all patients with recognized cases of SARS were cohorted on the sixth and eighth floors of building 1. On 28 April and 1 May, swab samples were obtained from surfaces on these 2 floors, where more than two-dozen patients with SARS were housed. Swab samples were also obtained from the medical intensive care unit on the fifth floor in building 2, where a single patient in his second week of illness was housed, and from the first floor of building 1, including a public lobby area that served as a SARS-response coordinating center and transfer station and the emergency room department where patients with possible SARS were evaluated and triaged. At the time of swabbing, health care workers in hospital B were using personal protective equipment inconsistently, and ventilation standards and environmental cleaning as recommended by the available guidelines were being established but were not consistently applied [10]. Patients from each of the 5 rooms that were swabbed were confirmed as having SARS CoV infection at some time during the course of their illness, either by RT-PCR, neutralizing antibody testing, or both. The day of illness on which these patients were confirmed as having SARS CoV infection ranged from day 5, for the patient in room 618, to day 12, for the patient in room 5303. Patients remained in the rooms when the surfaces were swabbed.",

Meticulous care was taken to avoid cross-contamination of swabs. Each set of sterile swabs was opened separately, and viral transport media was closed and the used swab discarded before proceeding to the next surface. A new set of outer gloves was used for each new sample, and outer gowns were changed between rooms. A circular area \u223c5 cm in diameter was swabbed with a sterile Dacron or cotton applicator moistened in viral transport media.

In brief, aliquots of viral transport medium were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells and incubated for 2 weeks, with periodic examination for cytopathic effect. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted with use of 3 primer/probe sets complimentary to independent targets on the SARS CoV genome. Each run included a positive control and negative water controls for both RNA extraction and amplification steps. Samples were considered to be PCR-positive if there were positive results for \u2a7e2 of the 3 RT-PCR targets. To assess for the presence of RT-PCR inhibitors in the samples, all samples were also tested using a primer/probe set complimentary to the 16s ribosomal RNA included in the reaction mixture. Confirmatory analysis of samples that tested positive for SARS CoV was performed in an independent laboratory using 3 different primer/probe sets, and all samples with positive RT-PCR results were retested from new extracts of a previously unopened aliquot from the original sample. PCR products were sequenced and compared with the sequence of the strain of SARS CoV cultured in the laboratory.",

The risk of contaminating surfaces with SARS CoV should be emphasized in guidelines for hand washing practices and for the safe removal and disposal of personal protective equipment when leaving areas potentially contaminated with SARS CoV. It also suggests that monitoring and reinforcing strict compliance with infection-control practices should be part of SARS prevention strategies [10].

It is reassuring that no surfaces tested positive in the hospital in Thailand, perhaps implying that, in a nonchaotic setting, attention to standard quarantine procedures minimizes surface contamination. It is, however, also possible that some of the differences in rates of PCR positivity may be due to patient-specific factors and not to differences in infection control practices. The surfaces swabbed in the Thailand hospital were located in an area that had only 1 SARS CoV\u2014positive patient, who had died at day 18 after the onset of illness, a time when viral load would be expected to be low.

It is also possible that there was viable virus on the surfaces but that it failed to grow after the initial handling, inconsistent refrigeration, or prolonged shipping time to the laboratories in Atlanta and Taipei. Other investigators have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive dried on microscope slides for several hours and that viable virus can be cultured even after several days in a moist or stable environment, such as in stool samples [1].",

Comparisons of the proportion of swab samples that tested positive for SARS CoV should be interpreted with caution, because the selection of the type and number of surfaces to sample was done nonsystematically and in a chaotic environment and is therefore open to a variety of potential biases. Nevertheless, visitors and staff working in hospitals with patients who have SARS should be aware of the possibility of virus being present outside of the rooms of such patients, despite efforts to contain the spread.",

Indeed, much of the epidemiology of the SARS epidemic can be well explained by these modes of transmission [16]. Transmission by more-remote means, such as airborne routes or through contaminated fomites, has been postulated as a way of explaining unusual clusters, such as transmission aboard an aircraft [2], on a hotel floor [3], or throughout an apartment complex [4]. Contamination of environmental surfaces may play a more important role in transmission than is currently appreciated, and the epidemiologic patterns associated with transmission from fomites, if clustered in patient-care areas with a high level of traffic, such as we found here, might be difficult to distinguish from the patterns predicted by person-to-person or large-droplet spread.",
