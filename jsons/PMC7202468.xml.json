Since its first report in 1998, H5N1 has been associated with very high case fatality rates of 160% [6, 8]; the cytokine storm produced by the NS gene segment of H5N1 leads to severe systemic inflammatory response and multiorgan failure [7]. Although the data available so far suggested that the present S-OIV is not associated with particular high mortality rates, the rate associated with the ancestor of S-OIV, the classic swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, was higher than that associated with seasonal influenza [14]. In a review of 50 cases of apparent zoonotic swine influenza virus infection, a case fatality rate of 14% was observed [14]. Because no animal model was available for SOIV infection during the time of our study, we used human macrophages harvested from healthy blood donors to determine whether S-OIV infection is associated with more marked cytokine induction than seasonal influenza, although not as severe as in H5N1 infection.",

Among the 5 cytokines for which both mRNA and cytokine levels were assayed, only 3 (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1) had detectable levels with the Luminex assay, all with good correlation between the 2 assays. For IL-6 and MCP-1, levels were highest in H5N1- infected macrophages (Figures 1B, 1H, 3C, and 3E), but theIL-8 level was highest in S-OIV-CA-infected macrophages (Figures 1K and 3D), which may imply strong neutrophil recruitment in S-OIV-CA infection. Among the 12 detectable cytokines, all 8 markedly induced by H5N1 are proinflammatory cytokines, whereas 1 of the other 4 that showed similar levels among the 4 viruses, IL-1 receptor antagonist, is a major antiinflammatory cytokine. On the other hand, neither S-OIV strain was associated with such a cytokine storm, with overall mRNA and cytokine levels similar to those seen in seasonal H1N1 (Figures 1\u20133). This finding is in line with the apparent relatively low mortality observed currently in most countries outside Mexico in the present influenza pandemic.",

In addition, markedly higher levels of MCP-1, MIP-1a, IL-6, and IL-18 were observed in the lungs of 2 of 3 macaques infected with S-OIV-CA [15]. The apparent difference between these in vitro data and ours could reflect different viral loads used in the 2 studies. We used an MOI of 2, but high doses of viruses were used in the animal studies. It is possible that high cytokine levels, reactive hemophagocytosis, and multiorgan failure could be present in patients with severe S-OIV infections with high viral loads. Additional experiments using higher MOIs would be necessary to determine whether higher cytokine responses could be associated with higher viral load in the present cell line model. Additional experiments using PBMCs from more healthy blood donors will also reveal whether there is much interindividual variability in immune and cytokine responses of human macrophages in response to influenza virus infections.",

            "text": "Our results imply that the mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated S-OIV infections should be antiviral agents instead of antiviral plus immunomodulators. Recently, we documented that zanamivir plus celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) and mesalazine (inhibitor of inflammation widely used for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease) significantly decreased the mortality associated with H5N1 infection, compared with zanamivir alone in a mouse model [9]. This was due to a modulation of the cytokine storm associated with H5N1 infection, indicated by a suppression of the inflammatory markers [9]. This finding is in line with those in our study, which showed that celecoxib plus mesalazine suppressed 6 of the 8 proinflammatory cytokines markedly induced by H5N1 (Figures 1 and 2). Others have also shown that selective COX-2 inhibitors suppressed the hyperinduction of cytokines in the proinflammatory cascade in H5N1-infected macrophages [16]. Because our study showed that S-OIV was not associated with a major cytokine storm and S-OIV infections were not clinically associated with major mortality, most patients should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir. However, for individual patients with S-OIV infection who have severe primary viral pneumonia with severe sepsis and multiorgan failure, immunomodulators may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in clinical trials. Because we previously showed that the addition of immunomodulators 48 h after H5N1 challenge were very effective in decreasing both the mortality rate and cytokine storm in a mouse model [9], such adjunctive treatment may theoretically be useful even after the start of a severe systemic inflammatory response.",

            "text": "There may have been attenuation of S-OIV during the early phase of the pandemic when the virus was adapting to the host. S-OIV-CA was isolated from a patient in California on 1 April 2009, whereas S-OIV-HK was isolated from a patient in Hong Kong on 30 April [10]. For the 6 cytokines with mRNA expression levels assayed, the levels of all 6 were higher for SOIV- CA-infected macrophages than for S-OIV-HK infected macrophages (Figure 3). Although this phenomenon was shown by the cytokine assay only for the IL-8 level, this may be because relatively small differences can be picked up only by the more sensitive RT-PCR assay. This explanation is in line with the fact that TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 expressions were detected only by RT-PCR and not by the cytokine assays for all 4 viruses. We speculate that this attenuation of the virus may explain the relatively higher number of deaths in the Mexican population during the early phase of the pandemic. Sequencing the S-OIVHK genome and comparative genomic analysis would reveal whether the virus was rapidly evolving in April 2009. Close monitoring of S-OIV strains as the pandemic evolves is important. It has been observed that the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was also mild initially, but the mortality was markedly increased in the second wave during the influenza season [17]. As a temporal series of the virus is not available, we do not know if this was due to an increase in virulence of the virus. However, the reverse genetically reconstructed 1918 H1N1 virus was shown to induce lethal pneumonia with proinflammatory damage and cytokine storm similar to that of the H5N1 virus in mouse, ferrets and monkey models [18, 19]. The present S-OIV was a result of multiple reassortment. Therefore, it would not be surprising if there is further reassortment and/or mutation, giving rise to more virulent phenotypes as the pandemic evolves in the coming months.",

            "text": "One major concern at the moment is the acquisition of antiviral resistance, and in recent weeks oseltamivir resistance has emerged in S-OIV [20]. This is similar to the situation in the 2008\u20132009 influenza season, when most H1N1 viruses that circulated were resistant to oseltamivir though still susceptible to zanamivir [21, 22]. Another scenario that would be at least as disastrous would be acquisition of virulence genes, such as NS or PB1-F2, from viruses such as H5N1, giving rise to a highly infectious and fatal virus. Therefore, as the pandemic evolves, strains of S-OIV should be monitored not only for antiviral resistance but also for their virulence potential, using the present cell line model as an alternative to the less available animal models [23, 24]. Because ferret and mice models of SOIV infection showed marked viral replication in lungs and seasonal influenza replicated mainly in the nasopharynx, there is reason to believe that more cytokine induction may occur in S-OIV, because the lung is a large organ with many reticuloendothelial cells. Because mRNA levels can be detected more sensitively than the corresponding cytokine levels, detection of mRNA levels with RT-PCR would be more sensitive for monitoring the evolving the virulence potential of the virus. Monitoring its genome sequence in the coming second wave in winter is also important to determine whether there is continued attenuation or increased virulence in correlation with the clinical scenario.",
