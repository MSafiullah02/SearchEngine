Strategies to reduce the risk of a flu-like reaction after IV bisphosphonates have variable success, and some groups may be more vulnerable than others. The possibility of an acute-phase reaction with fever and myalgia should be carefully discussed with patients, to avoid needless concern about this mimic of infection. The decision to use an intravenous bisphosphonate should consider the risk to patient or health-care worker posed by attendance at a healthcare facility (or even home) to access this therapy.",

Case series suggest that the risk of rebound increase in bone turnover and spontaneous vertebral fractures begins approximately 8 months following the last dose of denosumab [12], but this time interval may depend on a patient\u2019s duration of denosumab treatment, clinical course and baseline fracture risk [13]. We see a strong role for education programs for self-administration of denosumab, possibly in conjunction with Telehealth appointments. Patients receiving bisphosphonates should also be encouraged to continue treatment, bearing in mind the significantly greater risk of new fractures during drug intermission [14].",
