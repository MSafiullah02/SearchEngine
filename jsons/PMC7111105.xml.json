As of March 4th 2020, more than 80,560 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 3010 patients had died from COVID-19 infection in China [3]. Outside China, the disease spread worldwide, nearly 13,570 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and 270 patients had died from infection by this novel virus [3]. The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) that endangers international public health [4]. The WHO has defined a PHEIC as an infectious disease with international spread, or an unusual, serious, or unexpected public health event that exceeds local health resources, or that requires immediate international action [4].",

Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of novel infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), can increase anxiety, depression, and stress levels in the general population [5]. These negative emotions also affect sleep [6]. At the time of the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, some individuals with mild illness, suspected cases of infection, and people who had been in close contact with patients or a potentially high-risk environment were isolated at home. Even if the self-isolated individuals do not develop an infection and remain physically well, they often suffer from negative psychological effects. Importantly, the effects of mental health and sleep on immunity have been shown by previous studies [7]. Good quality sleep can help improve immunity to viral infection [8]. Therefore, mental health and sleep quality are important considerations in the population of people who have self-isolated due to their increased risk of COVID-19 infection.",

Portes defined social capital as a collection of actual or potential resources that include social trust, belonging, and participation, and believed that these resources were associated with a lasting network of mutual recognition [13]. In 1997, Lynch developed the concept of social capital as the will to generate social cohesion, trust, and participation in community activities [14]. There are differences between social support and social capital. Social support represents the size and source of social networks of people helping others, as well as emotional, material, and informative supportive functions [15]. Social capital includes social trust, belonging, and social participation. The effect of social capital on psychological wellbeing has been shown by previous studies [16].",

Individuals who self-isolate at home will suffer from physical stress due to lack of space for physical activity, stress due to limited social interactions, and anxiety associated with fear of the consequences of infection. Most individuals who self-isolate live alone or live with their families and may be more likely to feel lonely. Also, because they are isolated at home rather than in the hospital, they may feel more insecure than the patients who have been hospitalized, with increased uncertainty about their own risk of developing severe disease, or of not being diagnosed or treated in time. Therefore, the mental health of these individuals requires more attention.

In the first path identified, social capital affected anxiety, and anxiety directly influenced sleep quality. Social capital affects anxiety because when an individual has a wide social network, they may be more likely to interact with other people [24]. Social support and social resources reduce negative emotions, such as anxiety [25]. Therefore, when individuals are isolated, including during epidemics, online social groups that expand social networks and provide mutual support may reduce the anxiety of isolation [26]. The effects of anxiety on sleep have been previously identified [27]. Subjectively, people with anxiety may find it difficult to fall asleep, or they may wake up easily [28]. Anxiety may lead to increased cortisol levels, changes in cortisol secretion rhythms, and reduced melatonin synthesis, all of which reduces sleep quality [29,30].",

The stress response refers to the individual nonspecific response caused by various stressors [31]. Stress is closely associated with mood, behavior, a sense of wellbeing, and health [32]. People who have more social capital usually have less stress because they have spiritual or material support from others. Social support helps to reduce the perception and evaluation of the threat of stress events, the physiological response and inappropriate behavior caused by stress, and the level of fear and anxiety induced by stress [33,34]. Stress is associated with sleep quality [35]. When individuals experience stress, they often feel physical tension and mental pressure, they are more sensitive to the sleeping environment, or they focus on sleep too much, which will reduce their sleep quality [36]. Also, some variables may interact with each other. For example, anxiety may increase stress, and stress may increase anxiety [37]. Also, increased anxiety may lead to poor sleep, and poor sleep may increase anxiety [38]. Therefore, all the variables included in the present study, social capital, stress, anxiety, and sleep require attention to prevent a negative cycle of psychological and physical harm.",

However, this study had several limitations.

Also, social capital was measured using the PSCI-16 questionnaire, and the data relied on the ability of the individual to interpret the questions and provide accurate responses, but these responses were not verified objectively. Therefore, some causal relationships may have been missed. Further cohort studies with more samples should be performed, and non-subjective methods should be used.
