The other 2 SARS-vaccinated ferrets showed little or no neutralizing antibody even after the second immunization. All 4 ferrets displayed high levels of neutralizing antibody 1 week after challenge, with the titers waning at 3 weeks after infection, concurrent with clearance of the virus (figure 2B). The mock-vaccinated ferrets showed no virus neutralization before challenge (data not shown) and increasing neutralization 3 weeks after challenge, but with lower titers than those in the SARS-vaccinated ferrets (figure 2C). The 2 mock-vaccinated ferrets that showed high neutralizing titers 3 weeks after infection (41219 and 50409) also had high virus titers at day 14. One mock-vaccinated ferret (41247) cleared the virus by day 7 (figure 1B) and did not have high neutralizing antibody titers (figure 2C). The development of neutralizing antibodies was not strongly induced by the vaccine but was significantly induced in all challenged ferrets. This suggests that the vaccine was not immunologically robust.",

To further evaluate the potency of the humoral immune response elicited by the SARS-CoV vaccine and infection, we measured virus-specific IgG levels in ferret serum by ELISA. Overall, no significant elevation in spike-specific IgG levels was seen as a result of the vaccine (days 0 and 21), but virus challenge induced a marked elevation in levels of IgG antibodies (figure 3A and figure 3B). The mock-vaccinated nonchallenged ferret displayed no antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein (data not shown). The SARS-vaccinated ferrets produced higher levels of spike-specific IgG after challenge, and these antibodies were detected 1 week earlier than in the mock-vaccinated ferrets, suggestive of a priming effect of the vaccine. To determine whether this observation was due to the generation of IgM antibodies, IgG+IgA+IgM was measured. The levels of these antibodies were also slightly elevated in the SARS-vaccinated ferrets and were detected earlier than in the mock-vaccinated ferrets (figure 3C and figure 3D). This suggests that, although the vaccine generated only a weak antigenic response to the spike protein, it may have primed the immune response, leading to higher levels of other antibodies (figure 1) and faster clearing of the virus.",

In a mock-vaccinated SARS-CoV\u2014infected ferret (41247), there was focal bronchiolar hyperplasia (figure 4B), which was also present in other challenged mock-vaccinated or SARS-vaccinated ferrets (figure 4C). The inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes, were peribronchiolar (figure 4B and 4C). In addition, there was perivascular cuffing around a few small blood vessels. Virus was not found in any of the lung tissue by culturing in vitro or by staining sections (data not shown). Bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia was evident in 7 of the 8 ferrets that were challenged with virus but was not evident in the unchallenged control ferrets (table 1), suggesting that SARS-CoV infection led to the lesions, not the vaccine. The lymphocyte cuffing also found in 7 of the 8 challenged ferrets suggested a role for the immune system in resolving pulmonary infection (table 1).",

In the SARS-vaccinated group, 1 ferret (41271) had a slightly elevated ALT level on the day of challenge and a highly elevated ALT level 1 week later (table 2), but the level then returned to the normal range.

To date, animal models that mimic human SARS-CoV fatality rates are lacking. In fact, no animal infected with SARS-CoV has shown a severe viral pneumonia leading to death, as is seen in human infections. Animal infections are usually characterized by bronchiolar lesions with little or no alveolar involvement.

We evaluated the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV immunization and infection and did not observe high ALT levels in ferrets after vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV or after live virus challenge.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed during FIP-CoV infection [7] and may be part of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Disease associated with SARS-CoV infection results from immune-mediated infiltration of the airways by lymphocytes and macro-phages. Enhanced disease should be marked by increased viral titer after prior exposure to the virus or virus components. In the case of FIP, the virus gains entry into macrophage cells via neutralizing antibodies to the spike envelope protein, which bind the virus and are internalized by the cell. Macrophages have been shown to be virally infected in patients with SARS, and the concern is that these macrophages provide an additional host substrate in which the virus may grow. Furthermore, early and more robust seroconversion has been associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS, implicating SARS as an immune-mediated disease [25]. If SARS-CoV gains entry to macrophages through antibodies, then vaccines that elicit these responses may not be safe. We purposely designed a weak vaccine that elicited a mild antibody response to test the possibility that low antibody titers are associated with enhanced pulmonary disease as opposed to a strong antibody response, which should be completely protective. We did not see an increase in viral titer in vaccinated ferrets versus mock-vaccinated ferrets, and the vaccine did not induce ADE. This suggests that, under these conditions, an inactivated whole-virus vaccine can provide some measure of protection without the risk of enhanced lung or liver disease. Still needed are kinetic studies to show that infected ferrets are protected from further infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the role played by the level of the immune response in ADE needs to be analyzed.",

The most notable studies are those using mice [16, 26, 27] and hamsters [28]. Although the ease of using large numbers of small rodents makes the mouse and hamster models invaluable, the difficulty in performing experiments under BSL3 containment conditions limits the use of larger animals. Ferrets may provide a more convenient alternative to nonhuman primates and an additional model to small rodents. Here, we show that a weak formalin-inactivated vaccine does not enhance disease and that the ferret is a good model for evaluating SARS vaccine safety and efficacy.",
