            "text": "The recent global outbreak of an atypical pneumonia\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2014has been associated with a newly identified coronavirus termed SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Guo et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals. Infection of cells by coronaviruses requires fusion of the target and viral membranes, a process mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (De Groot et al., 1989). Coronavirus S proteins are synthesized as single-chain precursors that oligomerize in the endoplasmic reticulum and are processed through the Golgi, eventually forming long, petal-shaped spikes that protrude from the virion surface (Lai and Holmes, 2001). In some coronaviruses, S is posttranslationally cleaved into two chains, known as S1 (the receptor binding protein) and S2 (the transmembrane fusion protein) (Frana et al., 1985, Sturman et al., 1985). Coronavirus S2 is functionally and structurally related to a large group of so-called class I viral fusion proteins, including those of orthomyxoviruses such as influenza virus, paramyxoviruses such as SV5, retroviruses such as HIV, and filoviruses such as Ebola virus (Earp et al., 2005, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Harrison, 2005, Weissenhorn et al., 1999). A general fusion mechanism for these viral fusion proteins posits, in simple terms, that binding of S1 to a receptor on the target cell membrane triggers a series of conformational changes in S2 that ultimately lead to the formation of a highly stable postfusion trimer-of-hairpins structure (Duquerroy et al., 2005, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). A large body of evidence suggests that the fusion reaction proceeds via a regulated sequence of transitions involving one or more on-pathway intermediate(s) (Eckert and Kim, 2001).",

            "text": "S2 is a type I integral membrane protein with a large N-terminal ectodomain, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The ectodomain includes two highly conserved regions consisting of heptad-repeats (HR) of hydrophobic residues characteristic of coiled coils. The first HR (HRN) is adjacent to the N terminus of S2, while the second HR (HRC) immediately precedes the transmembrane domain (\nFigure 1A). By analogy with other class I viral fusion proteins, the N-terminal region of S2 contains a hydrophobic \u201cfusion peptide\u201d (Earp et al., 2005), although its exact location in the sequence is not known. The fusion peptide and HR regions must remain sequestered in the native S glycoprotein spike (Baker et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2002, Yin et al., 2006). During the fusion process, the fusion peptide is exposed and inserted into the target cell bilayer, providing attachment points for drawing together the viral and cellular membranes (Skehel and Wiley, 2000). Protein dissection studies from several groups demonstrated that the HRN and HRC regions of S2 associate to form a stable, \u03b1-helical trimer of antiparallel heterodimers (Bosch et al., 2003, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that three HRN helices form an interior, parallel trimeric coiled coil, whereas three C-terminal HRC helices pack in an antiparallel manner into three hydrophobic grooves on the surface of this coiled coil (Duquerroy et al., 2005, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). This rod-shaped \u03b1-helical core of the S2 trimer-of-hairpins shares features with the other known class I fusion proteins (Earp et al., 2005, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Harrison, 2005, Weissenhorn et al., 1999). Formation of the stable six-helix bundle has been proposed to bring the viral and cellular membranes into close apposition, thereby facilitating membrane fusion and subsequent viral entry (Chan et al., 1997, Tan et al., 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). Interestingly, isolated peptides derived from the HRC region of S2 can have antiviral activity with IC50 values in the micromolar range (Bosch et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004). Thus, in addition to providing insights into fusion-activating conformational changes in S2, determining the structural basis for interactions between the HR regions could assist anti-SARS drug development efforts.",

On the basis of circular dichroism (CD) measurements at 50 \u03bcM peptide concentration in neutral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), C44 is \u223c75% helical at 4\u00b0C and displays a cooperative thermal unfolding transition with a melting temperature (T\nm) of 40\u00b0C (\nTable 1 and\nFigures 2A and 2B). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that C44 is a tetramer (Figure 2C). The X-ray crystal structure of the C44 peptide at 1.70 \u00c5 resolution (\nTable 2) reveals a unique left-handed superhelix consisting of four antiparallel \u03b1 helices crossing at an angle of \u223c18\u00b0 (\nFigure 3). These helices form a cylinder with an overall diameter of \u223c25 \u00c5 and a length of \u223c60 \u00c5. An exact dyad is perpendicular to the superhelical axis. The distance between the axes of diagonally related helices (with the same relative orientation) is \u223c13 \u00c5, whereas that between the axes of adjacent antiparallel helices is \u223c9 \u00c5.",

By contrast, adjacent antiparallel helices exhibit a new type of \u201cknobs-into-holes\u201d interaction (Bryson et al., 1995, Crick, 1953, Harbury et al., 1993), whereby each Leu or Ile knob at a d position packs into a hole formed by the a and g residues of the neighboring helix and by two d residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis. This geometry results in a similar placement of atoms around the side chains at positions a and g. Knobs formed by a residues of one helix fit into holes formed by the spaces between the d and e residues on the neighboring helix and by two a residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis. Similarly, knobs at g positions pack into holes formed by the c and d residues of the neighboring helix and by two g residues in adjacent layers. Thus, the a, d, and g residues of the HR in the C44 tetramer segregate into four geometrically distinct helix-helix interfaces. By contrast, we note that residues at the a, d, and e positions of the lac repressor HR region participate in interhelical hydrophobic interactions (Deng et al., 2006, Friedman et al., 1995, Lewis et al., 1996). In summary, the conserved C-peptide region within the S2 ectodomain folds into a labile yet well-ordered, antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coil with unusual structural features.",

CD and sedimentation equilibrium studies indicate that recSARS-1 forms an extremely stable helical trimer that does not unfold upon heating to 98\u00b0C at 50 \u03bcM protein concentration in PBS (Table 1). Proteolysis of recSARS-1 by proteinase K yields two peptide fragments corresponding to residues 901\u2013950 (N50) and 1150\u20131185 (C36) (Figure 1B).

An equimolar mixture of these two peptides is \u223c90% helical and sediments as a trimer of heterodimers (Table 1 and Figures 4A and 4D).

The six-helix bundle forms an overall rod-shaped structure \u223c75 \u00c5 in length with a maximum diameter of 28 \u00c5. With the exception of the C-terminal-most core residue Leu948 directed at the 3-fold axis (\u201cx-like\u201d packing) (Bullough et al., 1994), the next six a and d residues in the N50 coiled coil exhibit classical knobs-into-holes side chain packing (Figure 1B). By contrast, the six helical turns closest to the N terminus lack any regular 4-3 hydrophobic periodicity. Instead, two layers containing an x-like symmetric pattern (Figure 5C) alternate with two layers containing an atypical two-core residue structural motif (da-like layer [Gruber and Lupas, 2003]; we call it \u201cy-like\u201d packing for convenience; see Figure 5D). As a result, the N-terminal half of the superhelix is underwound to an average pitch of \u223c250 \u00c5. Interestingly, the 19 residue \u03b1-helix of each C36 peptide (residues 1161\u20131179) intercalates into each of the grooves on the outside of the flattened coiled-coil segment in a \u201cridges-into-grooves\u201d arrangement (Chothia et al., 1981). Beyond buttressing the core \u03b1 helix, the extended N- and C-terminal peptide regions of C36 tuck into the adjoining grooves through hydrophobic contacts, forcing the extreme ends of the N50 and C36 chains into the rod-like structure. Fourteen amino acid residues from each C36 peptide and 38 residues from two adjacent N50 peptides contribute to an interfacial interaction that buries \u223c3,500 \u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface area. Recently, independent results on three crystal structures of similar \u03b1-helical domains from SARS S2 have been reported (Duquerroy et al., 2005, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). All four crystal structures can be superimposed on each other with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) for \u03b1 carbon atoms of less than 1.0 \u00c5. The high degree of sequence conservation among S2 proteins (see Figure 1B) suggests that each forms an \u03b1-helical bundle in a similar manner, but with interesting variations because some of the coronaviruses (e.g., human respiratory viruses 229E and NL63) contain 14 residue in-phase insertions in both HR sequences.",

Serendipitously, we found that this recSARS-2 molecule folds into a stable, helical, dimeric structure (T\nm = 72\u00b0C at 50 \u03bcM peptide concentration), as measured by CD and sedimentation equilibrium measurements (Table 1 and\nFigures 6A and 6B). Digestion of recSARS-2 by proteinase K produces two peptide fragments corresponding to residues 926\u2013962 (N37) and 1150\u20131183 (C34) (Figure 1B). The isolated N37 and C34 peptides individually display little secondary structure (Table 1). Upon mixing, however, they form a dimer of heterodimers with 100% helix content (Table 1 and Figures 6A and 6C). This complex undergoes a cooperative thermal unfolding transition with a T\nm of 64\u00b0C (Figure 6B). Thus, N37 and C34 associate to form a highly stable four-helix structure. To facilitate crystallographic studies, we connected the N37 and C34 peptides via a glycine-rich linker. This subdomain, denoted N37(L6)C34, possesses the same dimeric structure and thermostability as the parent recSARS-2 molecule (Table 1).",

Two C34 helices entwine obliquely around a parallel coiled-coil dimer formed by two N37 helices in an antiparallel orientation (\nFigures 7A and 7B). This four-helix bundle comprises a cylinder \u223c56 \u00c5 in length and 27 \u00c5 in diameter. N37 folds into an 11-turn \u03b1 helix stretching the entire length of the coiled coil, with an irregular 4-3 hydrophobic periodicity (Figure 1B). An alternating y- and x-like core packing in the middle four helical turns is flanked by the a and d layers, except for the C-terminal most Ile962 (x) layer. The flattening out of the superhelical twist in this central coiled-coil segment (pitch of 194 \u00c5), in conjunction with its disrupted core, appears to be critical in guiding formation of the four-helix bundle (see below). An electrostatic potential map of the N37 dimer shows that its surface is largely uncharged (Figure 7C). The grooves that are the sites for C34 interaction are lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues. In general, residues at positions a and d of C34 pack against the a, d, x, and y residues of the N37 helices, although contacts at other positions are also observed (Figure 1B). The interaction of each C34 helix with the N37 dimer buries \u223c2,560 \u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface area. It is noteworthy that the y-like packing geometry in the N37 dimer leads to the formation of two large holes in which the symmetry-related Asn937\u2013Ala938 and Leu944\u2013Val945 residues converge (Figures 7D\u20137F). However, when the two holes are occupied by the respective Leu1175 and Leu1168 residues from the abutting C34 helices, a wedges-into-grooves mode of packing (Chothia et al., 1981) results, with the interhelical Leu side chains in van der Waals contact. Such an elaborate N37 coiled-coil structure ensures a snug fit for C34. All of the interfacial residues at the buried core positions of this N37/C34 complex are highly conserved among coronavirus S2 proteins (Figure 1B), presumably reflecting selective pressure on the interactions between the HR regions in membrane fusion. So far as we know, this four-helix bundle structure has not seen before in viral fusion proteins.",

            "text": "A 73-residue peptide corresponding to the predicted HRN region of SARS-CoV S2 (residues 901\u2013973) forms an insoluble aggregate under normal solution conditions. In contrast, a closely related 63 residue peptide (N63) beginning at residue 911 has \u223c50% helix content and forms a trimer, as determined by CD and sedimentation equilibrium measurements (Table 1). We localized the \u03b1-helical segment of N63 to its C-terminal half (residues 940\u2013973) by truncation studies (Figure 1B). This 34-residue peptide (N34) remains trimeric and is fully helical (T\nm = 70\u00b0C at 50 \u03bcM peptide concentration) (Table 1 and\nFigures 8A and 8B), demonstrating the preference of this segment to form an autonomously folded subdomain. Its crystal structure at 1.70 \u00c5 resolution (Table 2) reveals a parallel triple-stranded \u03b1-helical coiled coil that is \u223c21 \u00c5 wide and \u223c52 \u00c5 long (Figures 8C\u20138E). Ten hydrophobic residues and one polar residue from each chain point into the center of the trimer (Figure 1B), and seven a and d positions show a classical acute knobs-into-holes packing characteristic of trimeric coiled coils (Harbury et al., 1994). However, three adjacent layers, starting at the third layer from the N terminus, show an unusual x\u2013y\u2013x-like core packing interaction (see Figure 1B). As a consequence, the backbones of the three helices in the N34 trimer are less sharply curved and wrap less tightly around the superhelical axis, resulting in a larger spacing between adjacent helices (12.5 \u00c5). The presence of the x\u2013y\u2013x-like break in the classical 4-3 hydrophobic periodicity of N34 is thus mirrored in its overall coiled-coil assembly and geometry. Such recurring heptad-repeat anomalies (Gruber and Lupas, 2003) may serve a general role in facilitating polymorphic structural transitions in viral fusion proteins (Baker et al., 1999).",

Current thinking postulates that a folding back of the S2 ectodomain drives the C-terminal transmembrane anchor toward the fusion peptide, allowing the two membrane attachment points to come together in the postfusion structure (Chan et al., 1997, Tan et al., 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). In the native S glycoprotein spike, the structure of the S1/S2 complex is trapped in a metastable state that precludes formation of the thermodynamically preferred postfusion conformation (Carr et al., 1997, Ruigrok et al., 1986). The structures and relative stabilities of the isolated C44 and N34 domains and the N50/C36 and N37/C34 complexes described here suggest a possible mechanism whereby the HR regions, initially sequestered in the native S spike, are sequentially refolded to promote membrane fusion, with the three distinct \u03b1-helical domains formed by the respective C44, N37(L6)C34, and N34 peptides representing different intermediate states of S2 in the fusion reaction. We should emphasize nonetheless that biological evidence for the role of these structures in the fusion process is currently lacking.",

            "text": "For example, the C44 structure suggests that the HRC region, which is known to be involved in the stable postfusion state, may also regulate activation of the metastable native state. Indeed, the tetrameric symmetry of this structure is consistent with topological considerations that argue against a symmetric transition from the native oligomer to the postfusion trimer-of-hairpins structure (Root et al., 2001). In a similar vein, the \u03b1-helical rods of the N50/C36 and N37/C34 complexes share the attribute of having the helices oriented so as to direct the membrane proximal end of S2 toward the N-terminal fusion peptide. This leads us to speculate that the four-helix bundle plays a role in bringing the attached target and viral membranes into proximity, probably prior to formation of the still more stable six-helix bundle. This idea is appealing because the subsequent structural rearrangement to the trimer-of-hairpins conformation could then be coupled to the actual membrane fusion event. In this regard, it is noteworthy that cellular membrane fusion processes mediated by the SNARE proteins also rely on a four-helix bundle structure to achieve apposition of the vesicle and target membranes (Sutton et al., 1998).",

This observation suggests that the N34 region may play a role as an adaptor to break the symmetry during the postulated S2 dimer-to-trimer transition by nucleating trimer formation during the conformational change. Cooperativity and irreversibility could be achieved when the HRC region folds onto the newly formed HRN trimer surface. Resolution of the four-helix bundle intermediate might thus be mechanistically and thermodynamically linked to formation of the trimer-of-hairpins structure. The highly stable N34 subdomain (with a T\nm value of 70\u00b0C, as compared to that of 63\u00b0C for the longer N50 trimer at the same concentration) could then represent a late intermediate state of S2 in which the central HRN trimer interactions in the postfusion state are present, but the zippering up of the outer layer has not yet begun. The structures and polymorphic interactions of the S2 HR regions presented here serve as the starting point for addressing this and other essential structural questions about the mechanism of SARS-CoV entry into cells.",

C-peptides could interfere with formation of either or both of the four-helix bundle and six-helix bundle structures in a dominant-negative mechanism. Fusion inhibitors developed by using these two different strategies could even act in synergy. Speculatively, the highly conserved, large pockets in the N37 coiled-coil dimer that accommodate conserved C-peptide residues may be attractive targets for the development of new peptidomimetic or small-molecular drugs. Finally, the four-helix bundle intermediate considered here may be exposed in the S2 fusion process, in which case antibodies directed against N37(L6)C34 may inhibit viral entry.",

Crystals belong to space group C222 (a = 43.7 \u00c5, b = 90.2 \u00c5, c = 42.3 \u00c5) and contain two monomers in the asymmetric unit. A useful heavy atom derivative was produced by soaking the protein crystal in the mother liquor containing 1 M sodium bromide for 3 min. The crystals were harvested in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NiCl2, 25% PEG MME 2000, 15% glycerol and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native and MAD data sets were collected on beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Table 2). All diffraction data were indexed and scaled by using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Two bromide sites in the asymmetric unit were located with Solve (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Density modification and phase extension to 1.7 \u00c5 with Arp/Warp (Lamzin and Wilson, 1993) improved the quality of the electron density maps and allowed \u223c95% of the final structure to be interpreted. Before refinement, 5% of the reflections were set aside for calculation of Rfree (Brunger, 1993). Iterative rounds of model building with O (Jones et al., 1991) and refinement with Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997) as well as the addition of ordered solvent clarified the trace, except for the helix terminal regions, which are not visible in the electron density maps and therefore must be disordered. Refinement was concluded with overall anisotropic thermal factors by using TLS groups for each monomer (Schomaker and Trueblood, 1998). The final model (Rcryst = 20.9% and Rfree = 25.8% for the resolution range 45.2\u20131.70 \u00c5) contains residues 1150\u20131187 (monomer A), residues 1153\u20131185 (monomer B), 1 chloride ion, and 73 water molecules. The model has excellent stereochemistry and structural quality with rmsds from ideal geometry of 0.015 \u00c5 for bond lengths and 1.6\u00b0 for bond angles. All main chain torsional angles fall within the helical regions of the Ramachandran plot. Some noninterpreted electron density, enough for 2 or 3 residues, can be observed at the 0.5\u03c3 contour level in \u03c3A-weighted electron density maps and may correspond to part of the disordered C terminus of the C44 molecule.",

Crystals of N37(L6)C34 were grown from 0.1 M sodium formate, 26%\u201330% PEG 1500 at room temperature. Crystals belong to space group C2221 (a = 41.0 \u00c5, b = 146.6 \u00c5, c = 24.0 \u00c5) and contain one N37(L6)C34 molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals were transferred into cryosolution containing the reservoir buffer and 15% glycerol, harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Reflection intensities were integrated and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) (Table 2). Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement with Phaser (Storoni et al., 2004) by using the structure of the C44 monomer (residues 1154\u20131186) as a search model. Two C44 molecules were oriented and placed in the asymmetric unit with a Z score of 6.8 and a final refined LLG of 111.9, corresponding to the N37 and C34 helical regions, respectively. This model and the data set for N37(L6)C34 were directly fed to Arp/Warp (Lamzin and Wilson, 1993), which provided a largely complete asymmetric unit of the N37(L6)C34 chain and allowed \u223c93% of the final model to be interpreted. The resulting experimental electron density map was of excellent quality and showed the location of most of the side chains. Crystallographic refinement of the N37(L6)C34 structure was carried out by using Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997). Density interpretation and manual model building were done with O (Jones et al., 1991). An overall anisotropic thermal factor correlation was applied by using the N37 and C34 TLS groups (Schomaker and Trueblood, 1998). The final model (Rcryst = 21.1% and Rfree = 24.6% for the resolution range 72.6\u20131.50 \u00c5), which contains 75 residues (the two most C-terminal residues are disordered) and 77 water molecules, was verified by omit maps. The model fits the 2Fo \u2212 Fc map well, and the Fo \u2212 Fc map contoured at \u00b1 3\u03c3 has no interpretable features. Bond lengths and bond angles of the model have rmsds from ideality of 0.013 \u00c5 and 1.4\u00b0, respectively. All main chain dihedral angles but one (Ile1183) fall within the most preferred regions of the Ramanchandran space, and most side chains assume well-populated rotamer conformations. Ile1183 lies in an additionally allowed region of the Ramachandran space and is the second residue from the C terminus of the structured C34 model.",

(B) Sedimentation equilibrium data for a 200 \u03bcM sample at 20\u00b0C and 32,000 rpm. The data fit closely to a trimeric complex. The deviation in the data from the linear fit for a trimeric model is plotted (upper). (C) Lateral view of the N34 trimer. Yellow van der Waals surfaces identify residues at the a positions, red surfaces identify residues at the d positions, light-blue surfaces identify residues at the x positions, and green surfaces identify residues at the y positions. The N and C termini of one N34 helix are indicated. (D) Axial view of the N34 trimer. The van der Waals surfaces of the Leu941(a) and Leu944(d) side chains are depicted. The view is from the N terminus toward the superhelical axis. (E) Region around the Leu966(a) layer showing packing of core residue side chains in \u201choles\u201d on the counterclockwise-related helices. The 1.70 \u00c5 2Fo \u2212 Fc electron density map (contoured at 1.5\u03c3) is shown with the refined molecular model.",
