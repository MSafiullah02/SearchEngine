However, testing is currently restricted to patients who require hospital admission. Hence, it is pertinent to collect a throat swab of all patients for a RT_ PCR COVID 19 test. The turnaround time for RT PCR is between 6 and 24 h, and this time lag can be a challenge in an emergency situation.Ai and colleagues1 report on 1014 patients who received both RT-PCR and CT in Wuhan, China, during their epidemic. They found that 97% of cases with RT-PCR-confirmed diagnoses had CT findings of pneumonia, and conclude, \u201cCT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19\u201d.8\n,\n10 Hence a pre-hospitalisation screening may be able to detect a silent case in the incipient phase.",
