The practice of social distancing has entered daily lifestyles as individuals, governments, communities, industrial firms, and academic institutions come to grips with the challenges of minimizing the loss of human life in the face of an invisible contagion. We have all seen figures on \u201cflattening the curve\u201d to help spread out the impact on medical facilities.

A widespread slowdown in economic activity is taking hold with a record number of people being rendered unemployed in the United States and elsewhere during March and April 2020. Stock markets have been gyrating wildly and national governments are implementing vast financial programs to buffer what is already shaping up to be an extended period of extreme hardship. The coronavirus outbreak is also having environmental consequences, with significant reductions in air pollution due to large-scale slowdown in economic activity. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainability remain to be seen, but deep and pervasive societal changes are likely to unfold in the coming months and years.1\n",

An especially salient example from which we can derive some instructive lessons is the financial collapse of 2008. In this situation, regulatory, technological, and cultural changes occurred to address the failings highlighted by the calamity. For instance, China invested heavily in a stimulus package that included a significant focus on renewable energy and this build up precipitated growth in relevant industries and reductions in production costs that benefited companies and communities around the world (Zhang et al., 2016).",

The post-crisis period will afford rare circumstances to shift supply and production systems toward a more desirable state. It is important that we plan for changes in public policy and financial investment rather than forego the opportunity because of a lack of timely action. One of our contentions, which we discuss later, is that we should not allow the macroeconomic system, global supply chains, and international trade relations as we have known them to revert to \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d once the most immediate phase of the current disaster has passed.

We provide a number of examples \u2013 many of which are starting to appear in the popular press \u2013 and consider how they relate to these aspects of contemporary provisioning systems. Our goal here is also to stimulate some additional thought by sustainability scientists and the sustainability community more generally to learn from this extremely unfortunate and disruptive event. The aim is to begin to secure the knowledge and to identify ways to inform our conceptual understandings and ongoing activities. We identify several research questions to set a small foundation for what we believe may be a way forward toward much broader sustainability transitions.",

As quality and ease of use improves, we are apt to see less physical travel \u2013 especially by airplane \u2013 after teleconferencing becomes further normalized. Another crisis-motivated shift is likely to be modification in the number of working hours per week. Prior research has demonstrated that there may be advantages from fewer work days in terms of reduced demand for commuting and increased productivity (Knight et al., 2013; Kallis, 2013).

Separate from current travails, there has been a long-running debate about whether JIT systems \u2013 which can be efficient in terms of resources and waste \u2013 are also environmentally sound (Baumer-Cardoso et al, 2020). We will likely see in their place implementation of smarter logistics systems, including reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products and enabled by Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. For example, knowing the location of electronics and appliances and their components through such means makes local sourcing easier. Furthermore, replacement of extensive transportation of processed goods over long distances with intermediate storage, depots, and material reserves is prone to gain renewed attention as inventory-buffering strategies.",
