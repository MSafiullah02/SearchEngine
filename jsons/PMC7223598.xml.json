The COR theory has proposed that people strive to obtain, maintain and create resources that they value, and the loss of these resources and values will lead to stress. Within this model, burnout has been conceptualized as physical exhaustion from an excessive workload that is likely to make individuals feel overwhelmed and unable to meet their work\u2019s related goals. The heavy workload decreases time to consider how to mobilize resources. The complexity of problems can be beyond their resources.",

Work related factors include specific work aspects such as overload, time pressure and many emotional demands. Organizational factors are comprised of rigid hierarchies, demanding values and the management model in the organization. Personal demographic factors may include socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, and education. Personality characteristics such as perfectionism, pessimism and high excitability also increase the risk of developing burnout symptoms (Keinan and Melamed 1987). In line with the COR approach, personal resources such as coping skills and interpersonal resources such as social support are significant characteristic resources, that may buffer the risk of the burnout. The occurrence of burnout syndrome has been described in diverse occupations, and it was often related to activities of caring, advising, healing or protecting (Weber and Jaekel-Reinhard 2000) and connected not only with overload demands at work, difficult critical decision making, but also with compassion fatigue, which is extreme distress resulting from helping others that suffer (Ledoux 2015).",

School psychologists are trained in a variety of treatment and diagnostic methods in order to provide services to a range of educational settings. This high demanding caring profession may predispose them to burnout. An early longitudinal study of the burnout of school psychologist reported the stability of the distress and focused attention on the role of environmental and personality variables (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness) in predicting burnout (Mills and Huebner 1998). Sandoval (1993) further confirmed the role of personality factors in predicting the burnout of school psychologists, but he identified a different set of personality characteristics. He proposed that individuals who are well-adjusted, free of neurotic trends, mature, optimistic and having a wide range of interest are less prone to burnout. Focusing on the differences between studies, Sandoval (1993) proposed that \u201cindividuals who are not well adjusted are more prone to burnout (Sandoval 1993, p. 325) and proposed that the Big Five personality variables accounted for the burnout. Recent studies have indicated that estimates of burnout across mental health services are higher than in other professions and school psychologists in particular are at a higher risk for experiencing burnout (Rodriguez and Carlotto 2017).",

It seems that social support and high levels of SOC may protect professionals from the risks of burnout and their negative outcomes such as physical and emotional problems (Del-Pino-Casado et al. 2018). In order to better understand the circumstances under which SOC may act as a protective factor against burnout, we examined the moderating role of loneliness, which is considered to be an interpersonal risk factor to burnout (Seppala and King 2017).",

However, research has not clarified the nature of these relationships. For example, medical residents who experience loneliness also reported higher levels of burnout (Shapiro et al. 2015). College students who reported higher levels of loneliness also revealed many symptoms of learning burnout (Lin and Huang 2012). Similarly, loneliness at work also was related to increased risk of burnout among small-to-medium enterprise (SMEs) owner-managers (Fernet et al. 2016).",

For example, loneliness has exacerbated the negative impact of perfectionism on depression and anxiety symptoms among college students (Chang et al. 2008) and moderated the link between poor problem-solving skills and suicidal behaviors (Hirsch et al. 2012). Additionally, protective personality factors such as sense of coherence may have a reduced beneficial impact in the context of loneliness. For example, self-esteem lost its positive impact in term of life satisfaction in the presence of high loneliness (Huo and Kong 2014). Moreover, coping strategies were ineffective when coinciding with high levels of loneliness (Marroqu\u00edn et al. 2016). Thus, in our study, the loneliness may moderate the link between SOC and burnout.",

The results did not confirm that the relations between demographic aspects such as the gender, years of experience, or type of school in which they work and burnout, emphasizing the importance of the personality and emotional aspects. These findings are in line with the COR model which highlights the significant role of personal resources when facing burnout more than factors related to the personal and workplace circumstances (Hobfoll and Freedy 2017). Thus, in the current study it was found that the interplay between personal resources (SOC) and social distress (loneliness) were predictive of burnout.",

The SOC is considered a protective factor that predicts positive health and adjustment outcomes. A strong SOC may enable school psychologists to respond adaptively to varied stressful situations presented by their work demands. In line with this approach, professionals with a strong SOC are better capable to mobilize resources, appraise stressful situations as challenging and use effective problem-solving approaches in order to manage stress and to experience lower levels of the burnout (Kalimo et al. 2003). This protective role of SOC on burnout was also demonstrated in previous studies among professionals such as teachers (Bracha and Bocos 2015), language therapists (Galletta et al. 2019a, 2019b) and welfare workers (Steinlin et al. 2017).",

Research emphasized the importance of the subjective perceptions of social support (Eagle et al. 2019). Thus, we hypothesized that the levels of loneliness as reflections of dissatisfaction from the social relations will moderate the protective effects of SOC on the burnout levels of school psychologists. The results confirmed the expectations. When loneliness levels were average or low, SOC was a protective factor, but not when the social distress levels were high. In an earlier study the loneliness was directly related to the burnout during residency of the medical profession (Shapiro et al. 2015). In the current study it was not directly related to burnout, but it reduced the beneficial impact of SOC as a protective factor. This finding support previous research indicating that loneliness did not affect directly the burnout, but has diminished the beneficial effects of psychological resources (Huo and Kong 2014; Marroqu\u00edn et al. 2016). In addition, the current results emphasized the detrimental impact only of high levels of loneliness. This differentiation between different levels of loneliness is in line with the Salutogenic construct that has rejected a dichotomy conceptualization of the construct (lonely or not lonely). Considering loneliness as part of our typical life, everybody may experience lower levels of social distress as typical life experiences. However, only high levels of loneliness have to be treated as a risk factor.",

The practical therapeutic implications of the study call for developing programs to empower the SOC of professionals and enhancing partnerships within a supportive network of educational psychologists\u2019 centers. Awareness to the threat of burnout and compassion fatigue (Kaeding et al. 2017) calls for preventive planning. In order to reduce the risk of burnout and enhance professionals wellbeing, and in line with the recommendations of the Consensus Study Report (National Academy of Medicine 2019) intervention planning have to integrate programs that will target individuals as well as the environmental conditions. This report showed that currently, interventions that significantly address clinician burnout are limited and requested extended studies and programs. The current study has suggested awareness to program that may enhance personal sense of coherence (e.g., Kahonen et al. 2012). Within the systemic consideration, it may also be beneficial to focus on social support from colleagues and management from the early stages of the psychological career in order to reduce feelings of high loneliness.",
