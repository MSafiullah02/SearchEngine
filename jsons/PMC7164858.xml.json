Nearly a century ago Sidney Pressey made a case for a simple apparatus that could perform these instructional principles - a teaching machine that was able to test, score, and indeed, teach \u2013 to substitute and assist teachers (1926). Today, universities, promptly followed by secondary and primary schools, are in a fast-track process to adapt their conventional education to design technology-enhanced distance learning (TEDL) - modern teaching machines - in order to reach the approximately 1.5 billion students who are not allowed to physically attend their classes (UNESCO, 2020).",

Educators are being bombarded with advice and good practices on how to design TEDL which inevitably incorporates the risk that developers focus so closely on what the innovative technology does that they lose sight of two other major components of quality instruction. First, the subject-matter content that this technology was there to deliver and second, the instructional principles with which this content can be effectively delivered. As Richard Clark (1983) so eloquently wrote, instructional technology is \u201csimilar to grocery trucks in that they delivered food to stores and so made food available more or less efficiently but were not responsible for people's nutrition.\u201d For this reason we, as guest editors of this virtual special issue, draw upon three important evidence-informed instructional principles from effective face-to-face education, namely using worked examples, providing practice and feedback, and stimulating metacognition to turn risk into chance.",

            "text": "Indeed, since Pressey, a tremendous amount of useful information about learning and designing effective instruction accordingly has been acquired (See e.g., Merrill, 2002; Van Merri\u00ebnboer; Kirschner, & Kester, 2003). The contributions in this virtual special issue present state-of-the art technologies that incorporate these well-established instructional principles. The principles also have the additional advantage of efficiency; that is their implementation is not excessively time-consuming, and can be easily implemented by educators across all levels in distance education but also in the transition from distance learning to more blended education, which is an undeniable convenience and necessity in post-pandemic times. We selected 18 research papers from previous issues of Computers in Human Behavior in the time period ranging from 2011 to 2020 that have studied these principles, stretching from primary to tertiary education.1.Providing clear guidance using worked examples and optimal use of multimedia principles. Sharing worked-out examples with learners before they start practicing on their own is a sensible way to guide students through the vast library of to be learned material (Atkins, Derry, Renkl, & Wortham, 2000). Online videos that are customized to the particular features of multimedia principles are particularly advantageous for a flipped classroom (Mayer, 2001).2.Providing ample chances for practice and feedback. Students need practice followed by feedback when they are putting knowledge to use. In order to move forward in an online learning environment students should know which next steps to follow and educators should know how these steps are optimally facilitated (Hattie & Timperley, 2007).3.Assisting students on their pathway to successful individual learning by implementing metacognitive scaffolds into the instructional technology. Research has shown that learners often have faulty ideas on how they learn which leads to ineffective forms of self-regulated learning (see e.g., Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell, 2013). Therefore, the development towards TEDL must go hand in hand with incorporating cues that stimulate self-regulated learning.\n",
