Respiratory virus panel (RVP) use was compared between 131 immunocompromised patients who received send-out (n = 56) vs in-house (n = 75) testing. Antimicrobial optimization interventions consisted of antiviral addition/discontinuation, antibiotic discontinuation/de-escalation, or modification of immunosuppressive regimen.

Send-out RVP testing was utilized in RVS1 (October 2014-April 2015) without AMS audit. The following year (RVS2, October 2015-April 2016), an in-house RVP that detected 20 respiratory pathogens (BioFire FilmArray RP \u00ae , Salt Lake City, UT, USA) was implemented with concurrent weekday AMS calls to providers. Multidisciplinary education for the use of the in-house RVP was presented and distributed prior to RVS2, and a prospective audit and feedback of RVP results was piloted with rounding pharmacists and the AMS service. The RVP was analyzed in-house from 7 am to 11 pm daily. All transplant patients and patients with immunocompromising conditions in the ICU with respiratory tract infections, tested with a RVP, were included. Pneumonia diagnosis was at the discretion of the critical care or transplant team, as per documentation in progress and discharge summaries. \"Immunocompromised\" was defined as those with solid organ transplant (SOT), hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), ANC < 1000 cells/cc, CD4 count < 200 cells/cc, or receiving other immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (alkylating agents, anthracyclines, mTOR and calcineurin inhibitors, thymoglobulin, TNF-alpha inhibitors, CTLA-4 agonists, and corticosteroids equivalent to at least 2 weeks of prednisone 20 mg daily). Patients < 18 years of age, and those who were pregnant or had death or discharge prior to the result of the RVP, were excluded.

Interventions consisted of antimicrobial optimization via de-escalation/discontinuation of antibiotic, initiation/discontinuation of antiviral, or modification of immunosuppressive regimen, beginning from collection of specimen and up to 48 hours following the RVP result.
