Max Summers and co-workers produced functional human IFN-\u03b2 in insect cells infected by a recombinant baculovirus [1]. This development was made possible by the previous observations that late in its viral life cycle, baculoviruses express at very high levels a protein, polyhedrin, which is not essential in laboratory culture. Substitution of the polyhedrin gene in the baculoviral polh locus by a foreign gene of interest resulted in comparably high-level expression of the desired gene product, driven by the polh promoter, without compromising virus infectivity and the viral life cycle [2]. Shortly after, a second study by Lois Miller and colleagues demonstrated that another very late promoter p10, showed similar characteristics and could also be used for high-level production of heterologous proteins [3].",

In the three decades since these hallmark contributions, baculovirus expression has become a widely adopted technology for academic and industrial applications, in research and development as well as manufacturing, and a wide range of proteins have been made by baculovirus expression vector systems (BEVS) [2, 4\u20137]. Multicomponent virus-like particles (VLPs) resembling complex virus shells have been produced successfully with BEVS, including VLPs from bluetongue, rotavirus and others [8\u201311]. More recently, the first baculovirus produced proteins have been approved in the therapy or prevention of human disease, including vaccines against influenza (Flublok\u00ae) and cervical cancer (Cervarix\u00ae), and immune-therapeutics against tumors of the prostate (Provenge\u00ae) [4]. Moreover, baculovirus itself has emerged as a versatile tool for gene therapy, either as a production system for recombinant adeno-associated viruses [12\u201314] or as a DNA-based gene delivery vehicle in its own right [15, 16].",

At the core of this expression technology is a recombinant baculovirus into which the heterologous genes of interest have been inserted. This composite baculovirus is then used to infect insect cell cultures grown in the laboratory. MultiBac is a more recent baculovirus/insect cell system which has been specifically tailored for the overproduction of eukaryotic complexes that contain many subunits [40]. An important prerequisite for the efficient expression of eukaryotic proteins and their complexes is easy-to-use reagents for (multi)gene assembly and delivery. Equally required are robust and standardized protocols for all steps involved in the expression experiment, from gene to purified protein complex. These steps should ideally be implemented as standard operating procedures (SOPs), especially in laboratories where the expression experiment itself and its optimizations are not the primary objective, but rather the protein complex and the determination of its structure and mechanism within a reasonable time-frame. The implementation of such SOPs will then enable non-specialist users to apply the technology with relative ease. The MultiBac system has been designed to meet these requirements [18, 40, 41].",

            "text": "MultiBac consists of an engineered baculovirus that has been optimized for multiprotein complex expression [17] (Fig. 13.1). The MultiBac baculovirus exists as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in E. coli cells (DH10MultiBac or DH10MB). The replicon (F-factor) present on the BAC restricts its copy number to (typically) one [42]. The MultiBac genome has been modified by deleting proteolytic and apoptotic functionalities from the baculoviral genome that were found to be detrimental for the quality of the heterologous target complexes produced [17\u201319, 23, 41]. The MultiBac system furthermore comprises an array of small custom-designed DNA plasmid modules that facilitate the assembly of multigene expression cassettes and their integration into the baculoviral genome (Fig. 13.1). Integration of the multigene expression cassette constructions into the baculoviral genome occurs via two sites (Fig. 13.1). One is a mini-Tn7 attachment site embedded in a LacZcb\u03b1 gene that is used for blue/white selection and is accessed by the Tn7 transposase which is expressed in the DH10MB cells from a helper plasmid as described previously [43]. Upon integration into this Tn7 site, the LacZ\u03b1 gene is disrupted; white colonies indicate successful transposition. A second entry site is formed by a short imperfect inverted repeat, LoxP, at a location distal from the Tn7 attachment site (Fig. 13.1). It can be accessed by means of the Cre enzyme, a site-specific recombinase that targets the LoxP imperfect inverted repeat (Fig. 13.1). Cre integration occurs by fusing LoxP sites present on the MultiBac genome on the one hand, and on a DNA plasmid module on the other. Successful Tn7 and also Cre integration is imposed by antibiotic selection against the resistance markers encoded by the DNA plasmid modules integrated into the MultiBac genome. The integration sites can be used to integrate genes encoding for one or several multiprotein complexes of choice, but also for additional functionalities that may be required to activate or inactivate the complex (kinases, phosphatases, acetylases, deacetylases, others), support its folding (chaperones) or post-translational processing such as glycosylation [19, 23, 44\u201346].\n",

A further plasmid was created, pKL, which in contrast to the high-copy number pFL plasmid is propagated at low copy numbers, and thus could accommodate difficult or very large genes that had turned out to be unstable in pFL. A new version of pUCDM was designed with a different resistance marker (spectinomycin), pSPL. pSPL or pUCDM could now be fused either with the MultiBac genome in vivo in DH10MB if Cre was expressed, or in vitro with pFL or pKL. All plasmids retained the Multiplication Module and therefore could be outfitted with several to many genes in an iterative way. pUCDM and pSPL were now denoted Donor plasmids (D), while pFL and pKL were denoted Acceptors (A) (Fig. 13.2) [18, 41]. One Acceptor could be fused with one or two Donors by Cre-LoxP reaction in vitro, and productive fusions were identified by the combination of resistance markers present on the fusion. The fused AD or ADD constructs carrying several to many heterologous genes, could then be inserted into the Tn7 attachment site of the MultiBac genome by transposition in DH10MB cells as before. In vitro fusion of AD or ADD plasmids prior to integration into the MultiBac genome via the Tn7 site did not rule out use of the LoxP site present on the viral backbone to additionally incorporate a Donor. Integration into the viral LoxP site simply had to precede the transposition reaction [18].",

As a consequence, the multigene assembly technology of the MultiBac system was adapted to automation by using a liquid handling robot [24, 25]. For this, the tandem recombineering technology (TR) originally developed for prokaryotic complex expression [38] was adapted to the MultiBac system [48]. TR combines sequence-and-ligation independent gene insertion (SLIC) with Cre-LoxP fusion to generate multigene expression constructs in high-throughput in a robotic setup. Adaptation of the MultiBac plasmids to TR required subtle adjustments of the plasmids resulting in Acceptor plasmids pACEBac1 and pACEBac2 as well as Donor plasmids pIDK, pIDS and pIDC that are robotics-compatible [22, 24, 40]. Concomitantly, with the objective to simplify the monitoring of protein production by measuring fluorescence levels, a new baculovirus genome, EMBacY, was created expressing a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from its backbone, with fluorescence intensity increasing in parallel with the quantity of the heterologous protein complex expressed at the same time.",

The foreign genes are provided by transforming a transfer plasmid into these E. coli cells. Selection for recombinant BACs occurs based on the resistance marker that is present on the transfer plasmid and also integrated, as well as blue/white selection; productive transposase mediated integration destroys a LacZ\u03b1 gene. The MultiBac system retains this strategy, extended by the option to provide in addition to the Tn7 transposase also the site-specific Cre recombinase transiently from a second dedicated helper plasmid, to fuse an additional Donor construct into a LoxP site present on the MultiBac baculoviral genome [17, 40, 41].",

These regions of homology correspond to the open reading frames Orf1620 and lef2/603. By using this method, insertion occurs by co-transfecting the transfer plasmid and the purified baculoviral genome into insect cells. The baculoviral genome is typically linearized in the region between Orf1629 and lef2/603, to suppress formation of virus devoid of the heterologous DNA of interest. Fusion of the plasmid DNA with the baculoviral DNA to create a replicating genome is then achieved via the homologous recombination system of the insect cells. The genome is thus re-circularized, concomitantly inserting the gene of interest. Live virions are then produced that express the desired protein(s).",

            "text": "Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. The Tn7/BAC based integration approach is the method of choice in many laboratories, mainly due to its simplicity. Since the baculoviral genome exists as a BAC in E. coli, it can be, in theory, propagated indefinitely and used for many experiments after obtaining the initial aliquot. Moreover, it can also be manipulated by gene editing technologies in its E. coli host cell. In contrast, the linearized baculoviral DNA for homologous recombination has to be obtained from the supplier for every experiment de novo and cannot be propagated at will. Furthermore, the homologous recombination method is arguably somewhat more involved and may require specialist knowledge. On the other hand, this approach is more amenable to automation as compared to the BAC-based method which is characterized by many steps some of which (such as blue/white screening) cannot be readily scripted into robotics routines. A further disadvantage of the BAC-based system may be found in the relative instability that was described for BAC-derived baculoviruses in insect cells, presumably originating from the presence of extended bacterial DNA elements (selection marker, F-replicon, LacZ\u03b1 gene) [4, 49], limiting its use in human applications mainly to preclinical studies [4]. In fact, baculoviruses used in commercial production to date are still being made almost exclusively by applying the classical homologous recombination technique [4].",

We therefore designed and created the \u201cOmniBac\u201d transfer plasmids which combine the DNA elements required for Tn7 transposition in the BAC-based system and also the homology regions for baculovirus generation following the classical method, and thereby are universally applicable (Fig. 13.4).

If a particular subunit is badly made in a co-expression experiment, it will limit the overall yield of the fully assembled protein complex dramatically. This challenge can be addressed within limits by co-infection approaches using several viruses, or the choice of promoters. In contrast to very late promoters such as polh and p10, earlier promoters are expressed at lower levels. However, it may be often impractical to resort to co-infection or to tuning protein expression levels by promoter choice, also due to the fact that the timing of the production of protein subunits will then be altered as well, with often unpredictable consequences. A solution to such problems can derive from observing the strategies certain viruses utilize to realize their proteome. Coronavirus, the agent that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), produces its complete proteome from two long open reading frames (ORFs) that give rise to polyproteins in which the individual protein specimens are covalently linked. A highly specific protease, also encoded by the ORF, then liberates the individual proteins by cleaving them apart.",

In ComplexLink, genes encoding for a protein complex of choice are conjoined to yield a single ORF. This ORF gives rise to a polyprotein in which the individual proteins are linked by short amino acid sequences representing a cleavage site for the NIa protease from tobacco etch virus (TEV) which is also encoded by the ORF and is the first protein produced. In addition, a cyan fluorescent marker protein (CFP) is present at the C-terminal end of the polyprotein construction. Upon translation, TEV protease liberates itself, and all other proteins including CFP by cleaving the TEV-specific proteolytic sites. The ComplexLink plasmids, pPBac, pKL-PBac and pOmni-PBac function as Acceptors in the MultiBac system and can be fused to Donors which may contain further genes encoding for polyproteins. The ComplexLink technology proved to be highly successful in producing difficult-to-express protein complexes in high quality and quantity, including the physiological core complex of human general transcription factor TFIID [52\u201354]. A notable exploit is influenza polymerase, an important drug target to combat the flu, which has remained inaccessible for 40 years since its discovery. Influenza polymerase has been produced, for the first time, successfully using ComplexLink in conjunction with MultiBac, enabling elucidation of its structure and mechanism by X-ray crystallography at near-atomic resolution [55, 56] (Figs. 13.5 and 13.6).\n\n",

Notably human proteins, virus-like particles (VLPs) and vaccines have been successfully expressed by using BEVS [2, 4, 5]. Glycoproteins are sought-after biologics in the pharma and biotech sector, and insect cells have proven to be well suited for the expression of biologically active and immunogenic specimens. The MultiBac system has been engineered to enable high-quality production of glycoproteins and their complexes. The original MultiBac baculoviral genome was already lacking the v-cath and chiA genes, which are encoding for cathepsin-like protease and chitinase, respectively. Both v-cath and chiA have been shown to be detrimental to glycoprotein production [72\u201374]. The glycosylation pattern of secreted proteins in insect cells differs from mammalian patterns which involve more complex N-glycans [75, 76]. These differences can have adverse effects on human glycoproteins produced in insect cells. To overcome this impediment, a new MultiBac-derived baculovirus, SweetBac, was constructed, which includes glycosyltransferases in the backbone, resulting in mammalianized glycosylation patterns of SweetBac-produced glycoproteins [23, 44, 45]. More recently, improved MultiBac variants were introduced to minimize fucosylation in insect cell derived glycoproteins to reduce binding to antibodies from the sera of patients with allergies [46].",

VLPs can be proteinaceous, such as for example papilloma VLPs used to prevent cervical cancer. More recently, enveloped viruses have been successfully produced using BEVS, including influenza and chikungunya vaccine candidates [4, 77\u201380]. The MultiBac system was already successfully used to produce a number of VLPs including an array of papilloma serotypes [40]. Complex VLPs representing highly pathological virus strains were produced safely [81]. In particular the availability of OmniBac plasmids, which are part of the MultiBac vector suite, may provide unique opportunities for VLP vaccine development, as they are equally useful for exploratory preclinical studies in high-throughput as well as pharmacological manufacturing, by choosing the most appropriate viral backbone for large scale expression (Fig. 13.4).",

Baculoviruses do not replicate in mammalian cells, therefore, the current consensus is that this BacMam approach can be performed safely in laboratories. A particular benefit of BacMam is that large DNA insertions including multicomponent signaling cascades or entire metabolic pathways can be transduced into mammalian cells by the baculovirus which can tolerate very large gene insertions, and can be amplified and produced in large amount in a straightforward manner in insect cell cultures. Baculovirus is thus emerging as a highly promising gene delivery tool into mammalian cells, for a multitude of applications [14, 15].

Moreover, in the laboratory, it has been recognized that the genome has a tendency to undergo multiple deletions in its genome during amplifications, notably in regions containing foreign gene cargo that has been inserted for overproduction [4, 50]. This can have severely detrimental consequences for heterologous target protein production, especially for fermenter-scale manufacturing of biologics which require large foreign DNA insertions in the viral genome and several rounds of amplification, until sufficient volumes of production virus are obtained to charge the fermenter. We have shown that some of these limitations can be overcome at least on laboratory-scale by stringently adhering to virus generation protocols that avoid or limit the occurrence of widespread deletions [18]. Moreover, it appears that there is considerable scope for improving virus performance by eliminating mutational or deletion hot-spots in the viral genome, and by removing DNA regions which are not required in cell culture. The baculoviral genome, in particular when present as a BAC, lends itself excellently to genome manipulation and editing techniques. We and others have exploited this avenue to remove unnecessary or undesired functionalities from the virus, such as the polh, p10, v-cath and chiA genes among (many) others.",

This approach may hold challenges given the complex interplay of baculoviral proteins and their relative expression levels during the different phases of the viral life cycle [4]. Notwithstanding, synthetic approaches, probably best applied in combination with sequential deletions, are exciting and potentially highly rewarding avenues for developing new and minimal baculoviral genomes that can be customized for optimal properties in the research laboratory and also in industrial manufacturing.",

In the post-genomic era, multiprotein complexes have entered center stage as essential catalysts of cellular activity, and notably the MultiBac BEVS has contributed substantially to make hitherto inaccessible protein complexes available, to unlock their structure and mechanism in molecular detail. Moreover, BEVS has emerged as a remarkably useful tool in the biotech and pharma sector, for the production of complex biologics in disease prevention and therapy. The development of this versatile expression tool is continuing unabated as it is set to benefit markedly from powerful new synthetic biology techniques that are becoming readily available. Fueled by these innovations, BEVS is excellently positioned to play a key and increasing role in the life sciences, in basic and applied research in the future. Exciting times are ahead of us.",

MultiBac consist of an engineered baculovirus optimized for protein complex production. This MultiBac baculoviral genome exists as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in E. coli cells. It contains two integration sites for foreign genes, by Tn7 transposition or, alternatively, by site-specific recombination mediated by the Cre enzyme. MultiBac further consists of an array of plasmids called Acceptors and Donors that facilitate multigene assembly. MultiBac baculovirions (center) are generated by transfecting composite MultiBac BAC in insect cells. MultiBac is successfully used for a wide variety of applications in basic and applied research and development (right). Genes of interest are shown as arrows filled in white.
