            "text": "Since the advent of the first vaccine centuries ago, researchers have been trying to find the answer of most common pandemic diseases through immunotherapy. Vaccination has successfully managed to eradicate a lot of prevalent diseases, but associated off-target responses, lack of prolonged protection across variable pathogenic strains and allergy, limits its horizon for the prevention or treatment of other globally prevalent diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, malaria, influenza and cancer. Though prophylactic vaccines use live-attenuated or inactivated pathogens, lack of response and protection against diverse pathogenic strains [2] . In addition, nanoparticles have the ability to impart more stability with high antigen loading and less proteasomal degradation of antigenic subunits. Small and more specific subunits often tend to be less immunogenic, which can be overcome by the use of adjuvants that produce co-immunostimulatory or immunomodulatory signals. Side effects associated with such conventional adjuvants with individual-specific response, immunotolerance to the target antigen and unwanted reactions towards self-antigens limit their use [3] . Therefore, biocompatible nanoparticles can also be directly used as adjuvants and may mitigate the need of strong conventional adjuvants (e.g., alum). Another reason associated with low subunit immunogenicity is their low cellular internalization and rapid clearance from the body. Nanoparticles with tunable physicochemical properties can overcome this limitation by enhancing circulation time, bio-accumulation in lymphoid organs and efficient targeting of immune cells. They can also increase crosspresentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activate the immune system at much lower doses. For instance, poly (lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles enhanced the cross presentation of ovalbumin through major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) in bone marrow derived primary dendritic cells due to which T cells were stimulated at 10 0 0-fold lower concentrations as compared to soluble antigen [4] .",

Most of the synthetic nanoparticles interact with APCs structurally to increase internalization rather than functionally as they lack specific binding locations for cell receptors. On the contrary, protein-based nanoparticles can interact both structurally and functionally as they can carry antigens as well as interact with the pattern associated receptors on APCs [6] . Nanovaccines have the ability to induce both the components of human adaptive immunity i.e. cell-mediated as well as antibody-mediated immunity with induction of memory response. Prolonged release of antigens from nanoparticle depots can cause enhanced stimulation for a long period of time, alleviating the need for frequent booster doses and therefore, nanovaccines can be used as both prophylactic or therapeutic which involves its administration before or after the occurrence of the disease respectively. However, the safety, biodistribution and residence of the nanoparticles must be optimized to obtain preferred immune responses towards nanoparticle-based vaccines.",

            "text": "The ultimate goal for vaccination is to generate safe and efficient primary as well as secondary immune responses in the body. In a simplified way, primary immune responses protect the body from potential damages that might occur on first exposure of the pathogen or antigen. On the other hand, secondary immune responses, which are comparatively rapid and stronger, are elicited depending on the immunological memory generated during first exposure and protect the body from future encounters of the same epitope [7] . Nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery emerged as an appealing platform for boosting both primary as well as secondary immune responses in the body [8 , 9] . There are multiple mechanisms by which nanovaccines help enhancing immune responses. Nanovaccines facilitate uptake of antigens in dendritic cells (DCs), which can further be enhanced by decorating the particle surface with ligands that selectively recognize receptors on DCs (refer Fig. 1 ). For example, ligands including Fc fragment, mannose and anti-DEC-205 (mAb) have been widely explored which selectively binds Fc receptors, mannose receptors and DEC-205 receptors respectively on DCs [10 , 11] . In addition to efficient internalization, ability to co-deliver multiple-antigens and adjuvants, inherent adjuvant property, rapid lymph node drainage and efficient antigen presentation on DC's surface are other predominant mechanisms by which nanovaccines help increase the duration as well as the magnitude of the immune responses in immunized animals [12 , 13] . Interestingly, these properties of nanoparticles have been substantially engineered to achieve desirable immune response for developing either prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines [9] . For designing a safe and effective nanovaccine, it is imperative to understand the mechanism by which the nanovaccine activates both innate and adaptive immunity in the body [14] .",

            "text": "Prophylactic nanovaccines are generally administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intranasally whereas therapeutic vaccines (e.g. for cancer treatment) are injected intravenously. Depending on the route of immunization, nanovaccines first encounter immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, DCs and natural killer (NK) cells which quickly recognize the nanovaccine (foreign particle) based on the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with them [15] . PAMPs (e.g. bacterial LPS, teichoic acid, lectins, oligonucleotides or material from the carrier nanoparticle etc.) serve as the ligands for PRRs [e.g. toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I -like receptors (RLRs) etc.] abundantly present on these cells [16 , 17] . Thus, interaction of PAMPs with PRR trigger endocytosis of larger particles (usually > 500 nm) preferentially by macrophages and smaller particles by DCs. Engulfment of nanovaccines by macrophages results in gradual degradation of nanovaccine particles and the encapsulated antigens. To prevent this, nanovaccine particles have been engineered to survive the attack by macrophages and facilitate direct delivery to APCs [18 , 19] . Additionally, depending on the type of PAMPs, neutrophils and macrophage secrete a variety of cytokines and chemokines which further activate APCs. Besides PAMPs, there are several unknown mechanisms which can activate innate immunity for example, induction of immune responses (potential adjuvant effect) by glycolic acid component of PLGA co-polymer [20] or by cationic liposomes [21] . Eventually, the secreted cytokines and chemokines stimulate maturation and activation of APCs (mainly DCs) which initiate strong adaptive immune response (refer Fig. 1 ). Therapeutic nanovaccines developed for treatment of metastatic cancer directly target DCs for strengthening adaptive immune responses in body [22] . Activated DCs serve as the link between innate and adaptive immunity.",

The CMI responses are triggered by migration of activated DCs (following uptake of nanovaccine particle) to lymphatic organs (spleen and lymph noted). Activated DCs present their antigens via MHC class I receptor to CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (refer Fig. 1 ). Activated CTLs elicit strong CMI and selectively kill target cells (infected altered cells or cancerous cell) by inducing apoptosis in them [20] . Killing target cells is a complex immunological process that attracts several compliment systems (CS) proteins and co-stimulatory molecules.

            "text": "Plasma cells are short-lived and their number gradually declines over time, as do the corresponding antibody titers [30] . In that case, memory cells (B cells and T cells) which were generated and stored in the lymphatic organs or bone marrow for several months, come into play and protect the body from reinfection of the same antigen. In such situations, memory B cells quickly proliferate and turn to antibody-secreting (mainly IgG) plasma cells to neutralize the antigen. On the other hand, memory T cells (both types CD4 + and CD8 + ) serve to produce more cytokine and chemokine signals to stimulate enhanced CMI and antibody-mediated responses. However, in case the structure of the antigen (epitope) has undergone significant changes due to cleavage, aggregation or re-folding, even memory cells cannot provide the required protection [31] . Although, in some cases, primary immunization can offer up to 90% protection, however, as even the rest 10% can be disastrous, therefore booster doses are scheduled to increase protection up to 100% [32] . Booster doses promote generating of more population and a variety of memory cells. Generally, booster doses are scheduled after the antibody titer from plasma cells has dramatically declined to allow more competitive binding of memory cells to the injected antigen [33 , 34] . In a re-lated context, the use of nanoparticles help recalling more robust immunological memory even at a low dose [35] . Nanoparticles (e.g. PLGA based nanovaccine) facilitate prolonged availability of intact antigen in blood due to sustained release that leads to a higher proliferation of B cells and hence more memory cells [36 , 37] . Also due to small size, nanoparticles can travel through the narrow lymphatic system to lymph nodes inducing differentiation of more memory cells [38] . For example, Demento et al., reported that over alum-based (free antigen) or liposome-based (burst release) carriers, mice immunized with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LM-OVA) encapsulated in PLGA particles (sustained-release) showed the highest protection against a lethal dose of L. monocytogenes even after 13 weeks post immunization. They observed that mice immunized with antigen in PLGA nanoparticles had a robust population of CD8 + T memory cells [36] . Similarly, Kanchan et al., showed that encapsulation of tetanus toxoid (TT) inside poly(lactic acid) (PLA) particles generated long lasting primary antibody response in mice and interestingly even after 18 months re-exposing the animal using very low antigen dose induced heightened and robust B cell responses [39] .",

Absorption of antigen on surface of adjuvants enhances antigen uptake and presentation, thus promoting antigen transport to draining lymph nodes [42] . Activation of TLRs has been potentially used for designing vaccine adjuvants. TLR ligands or agonists have served as potential immunostimulatory molecules as TLRs activate innate immune responses by identifying PAMPs and down signaling the transcription factors responsible for immune responses such as NF-\u03baB, IRFs and lymphocyte activation [43] .",

There are chances that free antigens may degrade and elicit local immune responses at the site of administration, therefore, encapsulating free antigen inside nanoparticles prevents their degradation and provides prolonged and controlled release at the target site. The controlled release of antigen prevents burst responses and eliminates the need of booster doses. Surface decoration of nanoparticles with antigen also confers the advantage of presenting the antigen to cells in a similar way as presented by pathogens [46] . Polyanhydride-based nanoparticles encapsulating F1-V antigen when administered intranasally induced an immune response that persisted for 23 weeks and elicited a high anti-F1-V IgG1 antibody response post-vaccination and conferred long-lived protective immunity against Yersinia pestis infections compared to recombinant F1-V antigen [47] . Similar nanoparticles were functionalized with di-mannose targeted macrophage mannose receptor (MMR). These carbohydrate functionalized nanoparticles enabled sustained release of immunogen for 30 days and enhanced the uptake of antigen by dendritic cells simultaneously upregulating the co-stimulatory molecule CLR, CD206, and CD40 in cells as compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles [48] . Apart from encapsulation, several other strategies have been exploited for the co-delivery of antigens and nanoparticle such as surface absorption, conjugation, and mixture (refer Fig. 2 ).

Due to above-mentioned effects, nanoparticles act as a better adjuvant in comparison to complete Freund's adjuvant and conventional aluminum containing salts by inducing higher immunogenic responses at low antigen doses [51] . Also, their small size facilitates internalization by dendritic cells and induces adaptive immune responses. Studies by Swaminathan et al., have proved enhanced immune responses by lipid nanoparticle (LNP) adjuvant formulations against ovalbumin (OVA) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice injected with HBsAg along with LNPs as compared to HBsAg alone [52] . Co-administration of quarternized chitosan nanoparticles as adjuvants along with ovalbumin intranasally in female BALB/c mice induced activation of APCs followed by enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation as compared to OVA mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel [53] . Asgary et al., also reported that silver nanoparticles showed increased antibodymediated responses against CVS-11 rabies and reduced toxicity as compared to conventionally used adjuvants such as alum [54] . Although nanoparticles possess great adjuvant properties, their codelivery along with generally used adjuvants such as TLR agonists can provide very robust immune protection. The use of TLR agonists is restricted because of their instability, particularly while using RNA as TLR agonists. Nugyen et al., have designed lipidoids to effectively deliver immunostimulatory RNA to activate innate and adaptive immune responses. These lipid-RNA nanoparticles enhanced IFN-\u03b3 responses and anti-OVA cell-mediated and antibodymediated responses. These lipidoids were superior to the conventionally used N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-tri-methyl ammonium methyl sulfate-RNA delivery system [55] . Similarly unmethylated CpG-rich oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG), a TLR agonist. These nanoparticles induced pro inflammatory responses and antigen-specific antibody and cell-mediated immunity. Colocalization of MPLA and CpG also induced functional memory CD8 + cells. These findings clearly demonstrated the ability of bacterial elements and TLR agonists towards developing a more effective vaccine design [56] . In addition, TLR agonists have been used in designing disease-specific nanovaccines, which are discussed later in this review. Layer by layer protein nanoclusters synthesized from recombinant trimeric hemagglutinin were immunogenic by themselves and induced protective antibody-mediated responses without the use of adjuvants. Such high immunogenic potential of peptide nanoclusters is because of the high antigen density available on the surface of nanoparticles [57] .",

Upon subsequent RSV challenge, 10 0 0-fold reduction in viral load and increased antigen-specific CD8 + T cells were observed in the lungs of vaccinated mice as compared to empty P22 vaccinated and unvaccinated animals [58] .",

A recent study on nonviral E2 protein-based biomimetic nanoparticle-containing acidlabile CpG (DC activating molecule) and SIINFEKL peptide epitope conjugate has shown the potential to enhance the CpG mediated DC activation by 25-fold in vitro as compared to unbound CpG. Interestingly, co-delivery of SIINFEKL peptide conjugated with CpG has shown elevated cross-presentation and CD8 + T cell activation by inducing a 3-fold greater display of SIINFEKL on MHC-I by DCs as compared to unbound peptide or peptide bound directly to E2 protein. This shows the ability of biomimetic protein-based nanoparticles to facilitate enhanced immune response by DC activation and cross-presentation [62] .",

Similarly, \u03b1-helical coiled-coil can also be formed into fibrils from \u03b1-helical peptide-like coil29 [65] . Such peptide sequences undergo assembly into fibrils with the antigenic epitope sticking outward from the fibril surface [6] . These fibrils have been assembled with various epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum [66] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [67] , Streptococcus aureus [68] , T-helper cells epitope PADRE [68] and OVA epitopes [69] . Conjugation of E2EP3 immunogenic epitope of Chikungunya virus E2 glycoprotein with \u03b2-sheet self-adjuvanted amyloid assemblies showed cytocompatibility with enhanced macrophage uptake and robust IgG response against E2EP3 epitope [70] . Self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs) are 20-30 nm icosahedrons containing pentameric and trimeric helical coiledcoils conjugated with (glycine) 2 linker (refer Fig. 3 (F)). Antigens and adjuvants can be inserted depending on the expected structure from in silico modeling [71] . Subunit malaria [72] , HIV [73] , toxoplasma [74] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [75] . Wahome et al., encapsulated two HIV protein epitopes (4E10 and 2F5) onto SAPN surface and observed enhanced production of epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies. This indicates the potential of SAPN as nanovaccine to activate immune response against HIV [73] . Nanoclusters have also emerged as a prominent vaccine platform prepared from desolvation of proteins and peptides. They are generally made up of antigens and crosslinkers with an intent to increase antigen loading and eliminate off-target sequences. Intranasal vaccination of influenza matrix protein 2 (M2e) containing self-assembled protein nanoclusters elicited enhanced immune response and complete protection after lethal challenge with hetero and homo-subtypic virus [76] . Since the preparation of nanoclusters requires organic solvents, it may alter the secondary or quaternary structure of full protein antigens [57] .",

However, the study was terminated due to no effect on survival and primary or secondary endpoint in a phase II study [91] . A phase I trial (NCT00922363) showed safety and immunogenicity of CAF01 (liposomal adjuvant system) given with a subunit vaccine against M. tuberculosis antigen H1. This adjuvanted vaccine showed long-lasting T cell response with no antibody response observed in healthy adults [92] . Viral liposomes called \"virosomes\" have also been studied in the literature. Virosome exhibits viral capsid proteins onto the li- posomal surface for effective fusing with the target cell membrane. Recently, virosomes and liposomes mediated immune response was investigated on human respiratory tract triple culture model. Both virosomes and liposomes were prepared from the same neutral phospholipids, DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and POPE (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine), but virosomes were also fused with influenza membrane protein.

Hexosomes are generally made up of lipids known to form non-lamellar structure in hydrated systems with inverse hexagonal liquid crystalline phase. Comparative adjuvant activity of mono mycoloyl glycerol-1 (MMG-1) immunopotentiator containing hexosomes and cationic liposomes (CAF04) loaded with Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP) antigen in CB6/F1 mice after vaccination was studied by Rodrigues et al. MMG-1 hexosomes made up of lipid phytantriol induced a strong MOMP-specific antibodymediated immune response whereas MMG-1 cationic liposomes elicited much stronger MOMP-specific cell-mediated response. It indicated the immune activation by two lipid-based adjuvants via different mechanisms [95] . In addition, cubosomes are generally made up of lipid bilayers forming continuous periodic cubic lattice structures with interwoven water channels and a stabilizing polymeric outer corona [96] . Phytantriol, pluronic F127 and propylene glycol-based cubosome formulation containing (imiquimod and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)) adjuvants and model OVA antigen elicited robust IFN-\u03b3 production and CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation as compared to similar adjuvant containing liposomal formulation and alum [97] . Such lipid-based self-assembled structures can provide high antigen and adjuvant loading with enhanced immunoactivation in comparison to conventional lipidbased carriers like liposomes.",

Though clear demarcation or direct comparison across nanocarriers has not been studied but there are unique properties and advantages associated with each nanocarrier that gives them an edge over each other. Biomimetic carriers like VLPs are expected to possess inherent immunogenicity that can elicit antibody reaction against carrier antigens itself. This could lead to the competition with the target antigen and alter antibody repertoire or memory response against it. Reactive toxicities or neutralization upon repeated dosing can also limit their multiple use in a patient [122] . Such problems can be avoided by the use of nanoclusters that are solely made up of single type of antigen. These protein-based biomimetic and rationally designed nanocarriers are most suitable for the incorporation of a highly hydrophobic antigens of varied sizes with an intent to preserve its native structure, whereas hydrophilic peptides can be well delivered using amphiphilic micelles [6] . Carrier specific immune response has also been observed for certain polymeric and lipid-based carriers but it can be avoided using natural or biomimetic components (e.g., cellular lipid isolates or extracellular matrix polymers) [6] .

PspA based nanovaccine formulation performed comparable to protein adjuvanted with alum, with much less tissue reactivity at the site of immunization [123] .

Unique immune responses are generated against disease-specific antigens. Generally, therapeutic vaccines are used for cancer treatment, but there are compelling evidences suggesting their potential use in autoimmune disorders also. The advantage of using therapeutic vaccines instead of conventional pharmaceutical treatment lies in their specificity [124] . Mono-specific, disease- Phase II [170] relevant pMHC complexes when coated on nanoparticle surfaces triggered the selective expansion of memory-like autoregulatory CD8 + T cells that arise only in affected individuals. Such engineered nanoparticles have the potential to become suitable vaccines with the capacity of resolving organ and disease-specific autoimmune responses. Systemic delivery of Type-I diabetes relevant peptide-MHC-nanoparticle complex triggered expansion of memory autoregulatory T cells and suppressed the autoimmune attack against insulin-producing beta cells, thus restoring glucose balance [125] . In certain cases, nanovaccines can be formulated to achieve both prophylactic and therapeutic responses. Poly ( \u03b3 -glutamic acid) based synthetic vaccine nanoparticles (SVNPs) loaded with ovalbumin and toll-like receptor 3 agonist (poly (I:C)) were synthesized by Kim et al., both of them enhanced the uptake of antigens by APCs and enhanced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2). Simultaneous injection of both SVNP-OVA and SVNP-IC conferred both the protective as well as therapeutic immunities by inhibiting tumor growth in EG7-OVA tumor-bearing mice [126] . It is clear from the above-mentioned examples that nanovaccines modulate the immune system either for providing prophylaxis or therapeutic responses against pathological conditions. Majorly prophylactic vaccines are used to prevent infections ( Table 1 ) and therapeutic vaccines have been used for cancer ( Table 2 ) treatment.",

By the virtue of all these properties, vaccination with archeosomes containing antigen reduced mycobacterial burden in the lungs and spleen of animals upon challenging with Mtb [135] . Similarly, selfassembled peptide nanofibers, when loaded with T cell epitope, also showed similar responses by inducing corresponding effector memory T cells and increasing cytotoxic T cell population in the lungs upon intranasal immunization. Mice vaccinated with coassembly of nanofibers containing CD8 + T cell epitopes and TLR2 agonists in the lungs increased the expansion of multi-functional cytotoxic T cell population. On further challenge with Mtb, significant reduction in lung bacterial load was observed in comparison to BCG primed mice [67] . In another study, Mtb lipid-based nanovaccines were used wherein chitosan nanoparticles bound with Mtb lipids induced cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity by secretion of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) and prominent Th1 and Th2 cytokines in lymph node and spleen cells [136] . The higher potency of nanoparticle encapsulated antigen preparation is because of their ability to form depots with a slow and steady release in the surrounding milieu and enhanced uptake of antigen by antigen-presenting cells [135] [136] [137] . As shown in a study by Diogo et al., liposome-encapsulated antigens elicited more profound antibody-mediated and cell-mediated responses than free antigens. Mice were immunized with free antigens and liposomeencapsulated antigen, further challenging mice 16 weeks post immunization with Mtb, it was observed that Mtb burden in the lungs and spleen was significantly less in mice immunized with liposome-encapsulated antigen as compared to free BCG vaccine [137] . The potential of nanoparticles in augmenting the prophylactic activity of antigens against TB was well understood and human trials were initiated. First-in-man trial on novel liposome CAF01 as an adjuvant along with the tuberculosis vaccine Ag85B-ESAT-6 (H1) is reported in 2014 [46] . Human volunteers were vaccinated with escalating doses of CAF01at 0 and 8 weeks. After immunization strong antigen-specific T cell responses persisted for 150 weeks and did not cause local or systemic adverse effects [92] .",

Pfs25 is one such malaria transmission-blocking vaccine antigen, but its immunogenicity is limited in humans. Hence, Pfs25 has been used along with nanoformulations to achieve desired im-mune responses. For example, codon harmonized Pfs25 (CHrPfs25) has been used with gold nanoparticles as adjuvants for the induction of immunity against transmission. Strong transmissionblocking antibodies elicited by simultaneous delivery of CHrPfs25 with gold nanoparticles could be due to the co-ingestion of nanoparticles and antigen by immune cells [112] . Similarly, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged (his-tagged) Pfs25 when mixed with preformed co-porphyrin containing liposomes at the time of immunization resulted in spontaneous nanoliposome antigen particularization (SNAP). Immunization of mice and rabbits with SNAP resulted in higher functional antibody generation as compared with other 'mix-and-inject' adjuvants. They have also been used for developing multi-antigen vaccines (apical membrane antigen-1, Pfg27, Pfs230 and the NANP peptide), targeting multiple stages of the plasmodium life cycle using liposomes [142] .",

Nanoparticles containing self-assembling recombinant cage of human heavy chain ferritin presented with 3-sequential repeats of M2e protein was observed to elicit elevated levels of M2especific IgG and mucosal secretory IgA antibodies with enhanced T cell response against H1N1 and H5N1 lethal infection after intranasal administration in mice [60] . Nanovaccines against the conserved ectodomains can confer protection against inter-species viral infection. Self-assembled virus-like particles (VLPs) containing multiple copies of M2e protein inserted into capsid (Cap) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) have shown dual protection against IAV and PCV2 lethal challenge in mice and pigs after generating M2e specific and PCV2 neutralizing antibodies [150] . Hemagglutinin trimer has also been exploited as a potential antigen for inducing protective immunity against influenza virus. Pham et al., immunized BALB/C mice with nanodiamond conjugated trimeric H7 and observed a significant higher H7 specific IgG production as compared to immunization with H7 trimeric antigen alone [151] . Similarly, Ross et al., have shown that intranasal or subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c mice with polyanhydride nanoparticles encapsulated H53 induced high titer neutralizing antibodies. Also, significantly higher CD4 + T cell expansion was observed in vaccinated mice as compared to non-vaccinated mice, thus providing cell-mediated and antibody-mediated protective immunity to mice. Mice were further challenged intranasally with A/H5N1 VNH5N1-PR8CDC-RG influenza virus at 63 days post immunization and viral load was significantly reduced as compared to saline-administered mice [152] . It has also been demonstrated that the polyanhydride nanoparticles give equivalent responses at 64-fold lower doses as compared to free antigen [153] . Also, encapsulation of antigen in polyanhydride nanovaccines exhibited stability of antigen for one year at room temperature, thus providing a major benefit for maintaining stocks of pandemic vaccines [154] .",

Due to antigenic variations, multiple strains of influenza virus have emerged over the years posing serious public threats, indicating the need for a universal vaccine, which includes broad cross-presentation against multiple strains of influenza to reduce community threats. Insights into the structural properties of antigens or peptides can be further explored for the rational designing of broad-spectrum nanovaccines using multiple antigens. On similar lines, to increase the breadth and potency of nanovaccines, Deng et al., have designed double-layered protein nanoparticles. The core of the protein nanoparticles (4MtG) contains four types of M2e from human (huM2e), swine (swnM2e), avian (aviM2e), and domestic fowl (fwlM2e) viral consensus sequences coated with HA variants hrH1 and hrH3 (refer Fig. 5 ). Mice were immunized intramuscularly with Uni4MC (PNp), Uni4C1 (hrH1-coated double-layer PNp) and Uni4C3 (hrH3-coated doublelayer PNp) and Uni4C13 (Cocktail of Uni4C1 and Uni4C3). Robust antibody-mediated responses were generated and induced M2e antibodies were strongly cross-reactive to diverse antigens. Also, Uni4C13 group produced broad cellular responses by significantly inducing more IFN-\u03b3 secreting splenocytes after stimulation with diverse antigen peptides. Na\u00efve mice were vaccinated with sera from pre-immunized mice with DPBS, Uni4MC, or Uni4C13 and then challenged intranasally with PR8 or Aic after 24 hours. Sera from Uni4C13 immunized mice prevented the mice from a viral infection, indicating the role of serum antibodies. Also, antibodies specific to human M2e, PR8, and Aic were viable for four months after the immunization in mice and implied long-lasting protection [155] .",

Intradermal immunization of mice with HIV-1P24-Nef/FLiC/PLGA (antigen/agonist/nanoparticle) enhanced IgG production even at 4-fold lesser dose of antigen. Nanovaccines shifted the immune response towards Th1 polarization and enhanced the Th1 cytokine pattern [158] . Recently, protease cleavage sites (PCS) has been utilized as a strategy to hamper the maturation and infectivity of HIV. Due to low immunogenicity of peptide antigens, they have been crosslinked with chitosan and hyaluronic based nano-formulation. Nanoparticles containing PCS showed enhanced activation of APCs and the production of anti-PCS antibody. Also, these nanoparticles generated memory T cells at longer time points after the last booster dose, indicating their capacity to elicit a good immune response upon infection [159] . Silver nanoparticles coated with amantadine triggered the production of HIV specific CTLs in the spleen of mice with 8-fold stronger TNF-\u03b1 production in vivo . The co-culture of these HIV specific CTLs with HIV infected cells in vitro enhanced the death of infected cells and reduced the production of HIV [160] . Similarly, HIV-1 peptide and oligosaccharide loaded AuNPs enhanced antigen presentation to isolated T cells from HIV-1 patients. Treatment with AuNP formulated vaccine increased proliferation of HIV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with increased secretion of pro-Th1 cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro [161] .",

A substantial 42.6% increase in activity was seen when EFV was given with GNPs. Both the moieties had a dual-faced attack wherein GNPs inhibited HIV entry into the cell by causing denaturation of gp120 glycoprotein and EFV inhibited transcriptase enzyme. The mannosylated EFV-GNPs (man(EGNz)) showed further potential activity in inhibiting viral dissemination when the host was pre-exposed to them before viral infection. Thermogels containing EFV-GNP and man(EGNz) showed 87.6 \u00b1 2.4% and 98.1 \u00b1 0.2% inhibition respectively in p24 antigen during anti-HIV prophylactic challenged study [162] .

Immunization of mice with protein nanoparticles conjugated to melanoma-associated epitope gp100 and CpG adjuvant enhanced the production of melanoma-specific CD8 + T cells. Pre-immunization with nanoparticles delayed onset of tumor growth and increased the survival rate to 40%, showing prophylactic potential of protein nanoparticles [59] . Luo et al., showed strong cytotoxic T cell response by a physical mixture of PC7A polymeric nanoparticle and OVA antigen. This was achieved by enhanced cytosolic delivery and antigen presentation in APCs of draining lymph node by PC7A NPs and activation of type-I interferon stimulating genes. Nanovaccines showed tumor growth inhibition in melanoma, human papilloma virus E6/E7 tumor and colon cancer models. The combination of anti-PD1 with PC7A NPs showed synergism with 100% survival in a TC-1 model over 60 days. Further, re-challenging of tumor-free mice with TC-1 cells after immunization with PC7A nanoparticles and anti-PD1 showed complete tumor growth inhibition. This indicates the prophylactic response of nanovaccine by generating long-term antitumor memory [46] . Liu et al., developed a unique prophylactic nanovaccines using metallo-organic nanoparticles (MOF) coated with fused membrane (FM) of dendritic cells and cancer cells. Presence of whole tumor antigens and immunological co-stimulatory molecules on its cytomembranes impart them APC like properties for cancer specific T cell immuno-activation. Since, fusion of DC and cancer membrane is accompanied by DC maturation, MOF@FM nanovaccines possessed lymph node homing molecules. Therefore, enhanced retention and homing of MOF@FM in lymph nodes and spleen as compared to only cancer membrane fused (MOF@CM) and dendritic cell membrane fused (MOF@DM) nanovaccines was observed. Pre-immunization of mice with MOF@FM has significantly prevented the development of 4T1 tumors by promoting differentiation of CD8 + T cell precursors into cytotoxic T cells with enhanced generation of IFN-\u0263 and IL-6 immuno-stimulatory cytokines (refer Fig. 6 ) [77] .",

The only US FDA approved therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge (Sipuleucel-T), has shown a moderate increase in clinical efficacy in prostate cancer [25] . The major problem in successfully developing a cancer vaccine is the selection of tumor-specific antigens called \"neoantigens\". Conventionally, cancer vaccines were developed by targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which are overexpressed specifically in a particular tumor type across patients. However, TAAs are also present in normal tissues; therefore vaccines specific for them can induce peripheral or central immunotolerance leading to autoimmunity or low vaccination efficiency [88] . Neoantigens are tumor-specific antigens derived from random somatic mutations but absent in normal cells. Hence, vaccines targeting such neoantigens using nanoparticles may enhance the outcome of cancer immunotherapy. Cancer nanovaccines can present unique and highly immunogenic tumor-specific antigens with increased antigen loading and efficient delivery, controlled antigen presentation, and retention in lymphoid organs [194] .",

A recent study showed biomimetic cancer-derived magnetosome with enhanced retention in lymph nodes after subcutaneous administration. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist (CpG) loaded Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoclusters camouflaged with cancer membrane and was decorated with anti-CD205 for preferential recognition by CD8 + DC population for cross-presentation to CD8 + T cells via MHC-I. Enhanced stimulation of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells due to prolonged retention of magnetically guided nanocluster in lymph nodes showed anti-tumor efficacy with improved survival in different mice models [191] . Similarly, Guo et al., developed an erythrocyte membrane coated PLGA nanoparticle-containing hgp10025-33 antigenic peptide and monophosphoryl lipid-A (MPL-A) TLR-4 agonist for enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Intradermal injection in C57BL/6 had shown reduced tumor burden along with metastasis and prolonged tumor occurring time after re-challenge in metastatic models [198] . Studies exploiting cancer cell membranes as an envelope to impart a wide repertoire of cancer-specific antigens can offer an advantage to develop various personalized vaccines towards multiple tumor types.",

            "text": "Another interesting strategy for developing personalized biomimetic cancer nanovaccines is the use of cancer cell membrane coated virus for increased adjuvanticity, infectivity and oncolytic activities to generate a strong anti-tumor immune response. A recent study showed the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of a 117.7 \u00b10.8 nm biohybrid artificially enveloped virus ExtraCRAd (Extra Conditionally Replicating Adenovirus). Oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5 containing a CpG island with a 24 base pair deletion was encapsulated into B16.OVA cancer cell line membrane. Coating of the cancer membrane was found to enhance the in vitro cytotoxicity of ExtraCRAd as compared to the naked virus indicating the enhanced infectivity of viral vaccine as compared to the naked virus in multiple cell lines. Intra-tumoral injection of ExtraCRAd in C57BL/6 mice containing B16.Ova, B16F10 and LL/2 induced models showed in vivo therapeutic vaccine efficacy in facilitating reduced tumor proliferation as compared to the naked virus, individual vaccine component controls and virus membrane mixture because of enhanced cross-presentation and T cell activation. The prophylactic potential was explored by vaccinating mice 3 times with ExtraCRAd.CMT64.OVA and ExtraCRAd.B16F10 vaccine before CMT64.OVA and B16F10 cells re-challenge, respectively. Prolonged overall survival and enhanced inhibition of tumor proliferation in homologous membrane enveloped viral vaccinated groups as compared to the naked virus and heterologous membrane enveloped group indicated the strong potential of viral-based vaccine imparting wide repertoire of cancer-specific antigens as preventive vaccines [199] . Another viral protein-coated dendrimer nanovaccine containing E6 and E7 peptide epitope of HPV showed enhanced cytotoxic T cell stimulation followed by HPV infected cells eradication. Tumor elimination was observed in 50% of treated mice with no recurrence up to 3 months post initial challenge [24] . Therefore, to address the problems associated with cancer vaccine development, special emphasis has been given on biomimetic personalized nanovaccines. The use of an APCs and nanoparticles coated with the patient's own cancer cell membranes can provide effective antigenic diversity to overcome tumor heterogeneity and tumor-specific immune response. This provides a key strategy to train one's own immune system with appropriate antigens. Research using such a biomimetic personalized approach can significantly improve the outcome of current treatment modalities. Nanovaccines have shown potential in augmenting the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of cancer vaccines.",

Specifically, strong interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system and the associated benefits have attracted atten- tion with the hope of producing less toxic and effective nanovaccines. Physicochemical variations in nanoparticles are one of the prime factors affecting their fate as \"nanovaccines\" inside the body in terms of their clearance, specific bioaccumulation, adjuvanticity, antigenicity and toxicity. Potent antigenicity with prolonged retention and release can cause nanovaccines to elicit both cellmediated and antibody-mediated antibody along with memory effector response, thus alleviating the use of frequent booster doses. Although nanovaccines are still in their infancy because of its limited clinical trials but new generation nanovaccines possess enormous potential both as prophylactic or therapeutic. Hence, exploring new avenues to increase nanovaccine safety and efficacy should be the driving force for further research in this domain of bionanotechnology.",

The nano-scale size can work as a double edge sword as pre-clinical and clinical reports showed their dosedependent acute and chronic toxicities with preferential bioaccu-mulation depending on the route of administration. Few classes of nanoparticles possess inherent toxicity after prolonged exposure like inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., metallic nanoparticles). Moreover, ISCOMs are being used in a number of animal vaccines, but toxicity associated with saponin-based adjuvants prohibited their use in humans. Therefore, concerns over nanoparticle usage for vaccines are still in existence. Scaling up is another major problem that has been minimized up to an extent because of technological advancements, but scale-up in a sterile environment is still a significant challenge [213] .",

A large number of such nano-toxoid formulations can be developed by varying the outer membrane coating of these biomimetic nanovaccines [213] . Despite the advancements in the field of cancer nano-based immunotherapy, the major challenge is the toxicological assessments of these nanovaccines. Prior evaluation of autoimmune side effects generated from nanovaccine induced immune activation needs to be done. Over-activation of antigen presenting cells by nanovaccine can prove to be detrimental as it may cause the death of dendritic cells [47] .
