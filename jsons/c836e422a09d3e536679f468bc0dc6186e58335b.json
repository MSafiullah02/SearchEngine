However, measures of leukocyte function are not routinely available in clinical care. Here we report the development and testing of an inertial microfluidic system for the label-free isolation and downstream functional assessment of leukocytes from 50 \u03bcl of peripheral blood. We used the system to assess leukocyte phenotype and function in serial samples from 18 hospitalized patients with sepsis and 10 healthy subjects. The sepsis samples had significantly higher levels of CD16 dim and CD16 \u2212 neutrophils and CD16 + 'intermediate' monocytes, as well as significantly lower levels of neutrophil-elastase release, O 2 \u2212 production and phagolysosome formation. Repeated sampling of sepsis patients over 7 days showed that leukocyte activation (measured by isodielectric separation) and leukocyte phenotype and function were significantly more predictive of the clinical course than complete-blood-count parameters. We conclude that the serial assessment of leukocyte function in microlitre blood volumes is feasible and that it provides significantly more prognostic information than leukocyte counting.",

In healthy patients, neutrophils and monocytes are early responders that are important for combating a pathogen, limiting tissue damage and promoting the return to organ function and homeostasis 3 . These leukocytes must integrate diverse environmental signals to inform their protective functional responses 4 . Sepsis is characterized by immune cell dysfunction, which is linked to the pathophysiology of the disease with consequent organ injury and increased associated mortality 1 . In experimental sepsis in mice, regulating leukocyte function decreases organ injury and lessens the severity of the infection 5 .

The monitoring of leukocyte counts does not reliably reflect patients' clinical and treatment responses. Sepsis-3 guidelines define sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, where end-organ injury and disease severity are defined by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 6 . These criteria carry an ~30% misdiagnosis rate 7 and offer little insight into the underlying pathobiology. Multiple point-of-care microfluidic devices have been used to investigate circulating cytokines and other mediators of inflammation as potential biomarkers in sepsis, but no device that reliably predicts severity and outcomes has emerged [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Since leukocytes (white blood cells) are sensors for multiple environmental cues and pathogens 4 , their activation and function could prove useful as cellular biomarkers of illness. To this end, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) dysmotility in microfluidic chambers correlates with sepsis diagnosis 15 . Importantly, repeated measurement of the complete blood count (CBC) can contribute to anaemia, which is often present in hospitalized critically ill patients 16 . Ideally, new methods for the assessment of leukocyte function during the course of a patient's illness should be sample sparing to decrease the risk of iatrogenic anaemia.",

We modified our previous device and developed a closed-loop inertial microfluidic platform for the labelfree isolation of adequate leukocyte numbers from microlitre blood volumes. A sample sparing approach would enable the acquisition of multiple biospecimens in one day, or during a hospital stay, for the repeated assessment of the host response without leading to iatrogenic anaemia. Here we demonstrate the power of preparative inertial microfluidics and cell-based assays of leukocyte activation and function in a proof-of-concept cohort of human patients with sepsis. Despite a relatively small sample size, this innovative integrative approach was more highly correlated to sepsis severity than the current clinical practice of measuring peripheral blood leukocyte counts and differentials.",

To enable the assessment of in vivo leukocyte activation and to minimize sample volume, we first developed an inertial microfluidics system ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ) for the label-free isolation of leukocytes from microlitre (50 \u03bcl) quantities of human peripheral blood. Eight spiral microchannels with a trapezoidal cross-sectional design (Fig. 1a,b) were connected in parallel with a circulation pump (see Methods) to a sample tube containing diluted blood (1:1,000 volume/volume (v/v)) 19 . As the diluted blood passed through the spiral microchannels, the system ordered and aligned the cells by size at each lateral equilibrium position secondary to a balance between the cells' inertial lift and Dean drag forces 20, 21 . This inertial microfluidics system was compared to an established method for leukocyte isolation by density-based gradient separation (see Methods, Fig. 1c ). Relative to densitybased gradient separation, the inertial microfluidics system had a shorter operation time (~22 min versus ~175 min; Fig. 1d ). This system also increased PMN concentration by approximately eightfold relative to input sample (Fig. 1e) . Both leukocyte isolation methods significantly decreased erythrocytes (red blood cells) to a similar extent (Fig. 1f) .",

In pre-isolation whole blood and after inertial microfluidic separation, PMN subsets were determined by flow cytometry (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The relative percentages of the PMN subsets (CD16 bright , CD16 dim , CD16 \u2212 ) in pre-isolated whole blood significantly correlated with PMNs after isolation by inertial microfluidics (Supplementary Fig. 3a) . The PMN functions in whole blood and after isolation were also similar when phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation were tested using Escherichia coli pHrodo bioparticles ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). In addition, there was significant concordance for the detection of the PMN activation markers CD62L (Supplementary Fig. 3c ) and CD69 ( Supplementary Fig. 3d) . Notably, no significant correlation was identified for CD11b ( Supplementary Fig. 3e ) and CD42b expression on PMNs ( Supplementary Fig. 3f ).

For these assays, the PMNs were isolated from 100 \u03bcl peripheral blood by negative selection (rather than the inertial microfluidics system) before introduction into the IDS chamber. PMN IDP was inversely correlated to electrical voltage ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). When exposed to an electrical voltage of 7 MHz, PMNs incubated with PMA had a lower IDP (activated PMNs) and flow in the lower conductivity channel (\u03c3 L ) (Fig. 3a,b) . By contrast, PMNs incubated with vehicle have a higher IDP (nonactivated PMNs) and flow in the higher conductivity channel (\u03c3 H ) ( Fig. 3a,b ). When exposed to vehicle, PMNs from patients with sepsis demonstrated a significantly lower median IDP relative to PMNs from healthy donors (Fig. 3c,d) . With PMA stimulation, the median IDP of PMNs from healthy donors significantly decreased to a level that approximated that of PMNs from sepsis patients (Fig. 3c ,d, Supplementary Fig. 5b) . The difference between the median IDP of PMNs exposed to PMA or vehicle can be expressed as \u0394 med IDP (\u0394 med = median IDP veh \u2212 median IDP PMA ) (Fig. 3c) . The \u0394 med IDP of PMNs from sepsis patients (day 0) was significantly lower than the \u0394 med IDP of PMNs in healthy patients (Fig. 3e) . The \u0394 med IDP of PMNs from sepsis patients significantly increased from day 0 to day 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ), but the median IDP from sepsis patients had no significant changes from day 0 to day 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ). To investigate whether PMN IDP was related to disease severity, we next determined whether the IDP correlated with clinical severity scores obtained on admission. The \u0394 med IDP was inversely correlated with the SOFA score (r = \u22120.64, P = 0.019; Fig. 3f ). There was a similar but not significant trend for \u0394 med IDP and APACHE II score (r = \u22120.38, P = 0.29; Supplementary Fig. 6c ) and median IDP was not correlated with the SOFA score (r = 0.08, P = 0.77;",

To assess the effects of inertial microfluidics on ex vivo cell activation, monocytes in pre-isolation whole blood and after isolation were determined by flow cytometry (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8a). The relative percentages of monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate and non-classical) in the isolated cells was concordant with those in whole blood and had a significant correlation by linear regression (Supplementary Fig. 7a ). There was also a significant correlation between isolated cells and whole Fig. 7d ). Monocyte function in whole blood and after isolation was similar when phagolysosome formation was tested using E. coli pHrodo bioparticles ( Supplementary Fig. 7e ). Similar to PMNs, no significant correlation for monocyte CD42b expression was present ( Supplementary Fig. 7f ). Classical monocytes isolated from sepsis patients (day 0) displayed no differences in cell surface CD62L relative to cells from healthy subjects ( Supplementary Fig. 8b ). Next, monocyte subsets were assessed in sepsis and healthy patients by flow cytometry (CD45 + FSC + SSC \u2212 and CD14 and CD16 status; see Methods, Fig. 4a ). Relative to healthy patients, patients with sepsis had significantly increased percentages of intermediate monocytes and significantly decreased percentages of classical monocytes; no significant differences were identified for non-classical monocytes (Fig. 4a,b) . To investigate whether monocyte subsets were related to disease severity, we then determined whether their percentages correlated with APACHE II score. There was a trend for an inverse correlation between classical monocyte percentage and APACHE II score (r = \u22120.49, P = 0.08; Fig. 4c ).

Multiple groups have developed point-of-care microfluidic devices to investigate potential biomarkers in sepsis diagnosis. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, neopterin and many others have been studied extensively but provided limited utility in sepsis severity assessment and outcomes [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In a large cohort of patients, using a point-of-care microfluidic device, CD64 surface receptor expression on neutrophils was found to be predictive of patient diagnosis but was of limited use in sepsis severity assessment 9 . A recent study demonstrated that the measurement of patterns of neutrophil spontaneous motility in microfluidic chambers enabled the accurate diagnosis of sepsis, which suggests that the measurement of leukocyte function (rather than number) may represent a potential approach for the development of sepsis severity biomarkers 15 . Here we modified and demonstrated a closed-loop microfluidics platform to isolate leukocytes using microlitre quantities of peripheral blood volumes to provide an innovative biomedical engineering approach to both the label-free sample preparation of leukocytes and the study of leukocyte activation and function in a clinical context. Our approach provides evidence that leukocyte responses: are measurable in small aliquots of peripheral blood; are distinct in sepsis and healthy patients; are dynamic over time; reflect sepsis clinical severity; are more predictive of the clinical course than leukocyte count; and are differential by repeated CBC (the current clinical practice). This sample sparing approach would enable the repeated assessment of leukocyte activation and function without substantially increasing the risk for iatrogenic anaemia, which is a common problem in intensive care units 16 .

These platforms have the advantage of obtaining a high purity separation from a small volume of sample without the use of a membrane filter. External stimuli can cause leukocyte activation, which may lead to inaccuracies in the assessment of the host response. Inertial microfluidics was introduced as a passive, label-free separation method. The fluid flow in an intermediate Reynold's number regime (~1 < Re < ~100) through a curved microchannel was used to order and align particles by their size at each lateral equilibrium position due to the balance between the inertial lift force and Dean drag force 21, 26, [32] [33] [34] . This technique has been applied to various clinical samples, for example the separation of circulating tumour cells [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , leukocytes 17,18 , mesenchymal stem cells 40 , viruses 41, 42 , bacteria 42 and antigen-specific lymphocytes from human blood 43, 44 . To overcome the limitations of the syringe-based operation of inertial microfluidics, our group introduced the closed-loop operation of spiral microfluidics for clinical sample preparation (neutrophil extraction from patient airway secretions) 17 and virus isolation from patient blood cell contents 41 . Here we modified the closed-loop microfluidics platform to demonstrate the isolation of leukocytes using microlitres of peripheral blood. This approach was designed to fulfil two aspects of sample preparation: the extraction of functionally intact and relatively pure PMNs from aliquots of human blood; and the isolation of appropriate numbers of leukocytes from minimal blood volumes from humans to facilitate clinical integration. Bacteraemia during sepsis was previously shown to activate the complement system that reduces PMN superoxide anion production, phagocytosis 45 and degranulation 46 . In this study, we found that patients with sepsis had relatively decreased LTB 4 -induced PMN superoxide anion production and elastase release on admission. By contrast, PMN responses to PMA were similar in sepsis and healthy patients. These findings suggest that, in sepsis patients, PMN responses to receptor-mediated soluble stimuli were uncoupled with a preserved capacity for NADPH oxidase assembly and degranulation in the presence of receptor independent stimuli. The detection of this functional distinction emphasizes the potential value of a cellular biomarker. There was a time-dependent increase in LTB 4 -initiated responses in sepsis from day 0 to day 7 that reflected decreasing clinical severity.",

The dynamic changes in PMN subsets correlated to clinical severity scores at presentation (APACHE II score) and over time (SOFA score). Cell activation can be determined by monitoring the IDP after IDS 22 . Previous quantifiable methods for the electrical characterization of neutrophil activation, such as patch clamping 48 and electrorotation 49 , have a low throughput that makes it difficult to continuously characterize thousands of cells to provide clinically meaningful results. Other high-throughput electrical characterization techniques, such as microfluidic impedance cytometry 50 , have not been shown to be sensitive to PMN activation and, furthermore, are sensitive to size variations that may confound the analysis. The rapid quantification of activated PMNs using IDS can provide a timely indicator of host responses to sepsis progression, thus allowing faster stratification of the severity of illness and improved administration of targeted treatment. In the course of the research presented here, we found that the electrical properties correlated better with the SOFA score and mechanical ventilation than the current measures of leukocyte enumeration. Differences in the electrical properties of human PMNs are due to electrical changes in both membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity during the degranulation process and a substantial increase in reactive oxygen species generation. The IDS platform enables the characterization of PMN activation in sepsis patients by monitoring the cells' natural (high-conductivity) media. In preclinical animal models, electrical cell profiles correlate with established assessments of cell activation (flow cytometry immunophenotyping) 22 . Here, IDS distinguished ex vivo human PMNs activated by PMA from non-activated PMNs. We used the \u0394 med IDP, as it provides the quantitative IDP change that reflects the changing electrical properties according to PMN activation, with the addition of a positive control to account for variabilities in the device and sample. In healthy patients, a decreased median IDP with PMA relative to the vehicle was expressed as a \u0394 med IDP. The \u0394 med IDP in sepsis patients was significantly smaller because the median IDP for vehicle-exposed PMNs from patients with sepsis was already reduced compared to PMNs from healthy subjects, consistent with the notion that PMNs from sepsis patients were activated in vivo. The \u0394 med IDP for PMNs from sepsis patients significantly increased from day 0 to day 7, approaching the \u0394 med IDP for PMNs in healthy patients at hospital day 7. In addition, the SOFA score was inversely correlated with \u0394 med IDP. Notably, the differences in flow rate through the designed inertial microfluidic and IDS devices precluded their integration, so PMNs were isolated by negative selection before IDS. However, there are a variety of ways to connect a high-flow-rate device to a low-flow-rate device. One approach, for example, is to store isolated PMNs from the spiral device in an injection loop, which can be loaded at a high flow rate, and then inject that sample into the IDS device at a lower flow rate for electrical profiling. In this fashion, the injection loop serves to bridge the flow rate mismatch between the two devices. Such integration will be one focus of future work.",

The intermediate monocyte population is of interest as, relative to other monocyte subsets, these cells display proinflammatory properties 54 and are associated with risk for acute inflammatory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 52 . Consistent with these reported changes, we identified an expansion of intermediate monocytes and concomitant reduction in the percentages of classical monocytes in patients admitted with sepsis (day 0). The APACHE II score was inversely correlated with the classical monocyte percentage.

By comparison, the score plot and aggregation of the mean z scores of leukocyte phenotype markers and PMN functional responses differentiated healthy and sepsis patients significantly at day 0. Measures of PMN function changed significantly from day 0 to day 7 and correlated with the SOFA score. The \u0394 med IDP was significantly lower for the most critically ill patients who required mechanical ventilation.

In sepsis there is only rarely a failure to obtain source control of the infection. More commonly, an overly exuberant host immune response leading to multiorgan system injury causes excess morbidity and mortality in sepsis. We lack clinical diagnostics for the early and rapid assessment of the nature and intensity of the host response, so this project was designed to monitor circulating leukocyte activation and function as relevant indicators of the host response to address this important unmet clinical need and, in the longer term, to enable new therapeutic strategies that target the host response. In addition, this study has identified several leukocyte parameters that correlate with sepsis severity and could serve as leukocyte biomarkers for early stratification, on initial assessment, and for disease progression, with repeated measurement. The correlation of these parameters with early stratification and clinical outcomes will need validation and further study in a larger clinical cohort that incorporates patients at more than a single clinical centre.",

Four spiral channels were parallelized with individual inlets and common outlets (Fig. 1a) . In this study, double-layered microfluidics (eight spiral microchannels in total) were used to enhance the throughput and match the range of the flow sensor. Further enhancement of throughput was achieved by stacking more channels within the tolerable dead volume limits of the assay. The first (thick) and second (thin) layers of the spiral channel were constructed by casting degassed PDMS (10:1 mixture of base and curing agent, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Inc.) onto the aluminium mould and curing on the hotplate for 10 min at 150 \u00b0C before peeling the cured PDMS off the mould. Two layers were plasma bonded with the channel side facing up. A thin film of PDMS (BISCO HT-6240 40 Duro silicone sheet, 0.25 mm thick, Rogers Corp.) was also plasma bonded on the glass slide. Both complexes were placed into the oven and annealed for 6 h. Holes for the fluidic access of microchannels were punched with 4 mm biopsy punches (Integra Miltex). The punched two-layered PDMS was then plasma bonded to a PDMS glass slide and placed in a 60 \u00b0C oven for over 6 h to strengthen the bonding.

The statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 for Mac (GraphPad). For multivariate statistical analysis, principal component analysis was performed for samples with complete datasets using R software and the mean z score was calculated using SPSS. Study approval. Written informed consent from subjects or their surrogates was obtained after Institutional Review Board approval (IRB no. 2002P000272 for healthy subjects, IRB no. 2008P000495 for intensive care unit subjects with sepsis 58 and IRB no. 2017P000367 for floor subjects with sepsis 59 ), before inclusion in the study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.",
