All Moroccan cities were locked down, and the majority of industrial and commercial activities have been forced to stop their activities until further notice. For citizens, the authorities request them to stay at home and don't leave it except for very specific reasons (buy essential supplies, medical appointments\u2026). In add to these safety actions, the authorities decide also to shut down transportation and travel in and out of the country, close down schools, universities, restaurants and mosques, and to ban the mass gatherings across Morocco (Maneesh and El Alaoui, 2020). However, some activities have been partially maintained as public service operation, pandemic prevention and control, and residential living needs. The Moroccan Government has decided to extend this sanitary state of emergency until 20 May 2020.",

However, Wang et al. (2020) argued that the severe air pollution events would not be avoided by reducing anthropogenic activities (traffic and industrial activities) during Covid-19 outbreak, particularly when meteorology is unfavourable. While the cities' lockdown could significantly improve the air quality, its effect may differ considerably across different types of cities. He et al. (2020a) find that more industrialized and colder cities experienced larger reductions in air pollution levels. Furthermore, Croitoru and Sarraf (2017) reported that the rigorous options to reduce the ambient air pollution in most Moroccan cities depending on the emission sources. For instance, air pollution from the transport sector can be decreased through the improvement of the transport system and/or promoting alternative modes of transport. Nevertheless, they highlighted that such options, among others, need to be carefully considered and adapted to the context of each city.",

These regulated pollutants arise from anthropogenic sources, including road traffic (e.g., motor exhaust; brake, wear and road erosion; resuspension due to wheel-generated turbulence) and industrial activities (e.g., metal processing industry and waste management) (Thorpe and Harrison, 2008; He et al., 2020b). Besides the above emission sources, long-range pollution also plays an important role in certain worldwide countries. In Morocco, Benchrif et al. (2018) underlined the predominant influence of the trans-boundary pollution onto the northern cities air quality. In this context, the objective of the present paper is to assess the variations of PM10, NO2 and SO2 concentrations in the ambient air of Sal\u00e9 city before and during few days into the implementation of the lockdown measures against the propagation of Covid-19 pandemic.",

The measurements were carried out from 11 March to 02 April 2020 on Medersa des Merinides (Fig. 1\n), located about 1.5 km west of the historical city centre (M\u00e9dina). The instruments were set up on a terraced roof, approximately 10 m above ground level (34.04\u00b0N, 6.83\u00b0W). Ambient air PM10 (aerosols < 10 \u03bcm in diameter) were collected on pre-baked (at 500 \u00b0C during 2 h) 150 mm diameter QM-A Quartz fiber filters (Whatman\u00ae). Daily samples were collected with high-volume (DA80, Digitel) sampler during 24 h with an operating flow rate of 30 m3/h. To determine PM10 mass concentrations, filters were weighed before and after sampling using a Mettler Microbalance (Model MS304S) with 0.1 mg precision. Filter weighing was achieved, in an acclimatized room for 24 h at an average temperature of 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C with atmospheric relative humidity maintained below 30%. The uncertainty for each weighing was typically of the order of 20 \u03bcg, which represents an average uncertainty of 0.1% for PM10 measurements.",

Three days backward trajectories arriving over sampling point were computed at 12:00 UTC at an elevation of 500 m above ground level. Then, cluster analysis technique was carried out to categorize the trajectories into distinct clusters (Benchrif et al., 2018). Furthermore, for investigating the role of the meteorology on the concentrations of studied urban air pollutants, meteorological data records were obtained from the weather station Rabat-Sal\u00e9 Airport (34.05, \u22126.75), about 12 km from our sampling site (https://www.wunderground.com). The recorded metrological data were: wind speed (m/s), relative humidity (%), precipitation (mm) and air temperature (\u00b0C).",

It is primarily resulted from high temperature combustion processes of fossil fuels, especially diesel, thermal power generation, industrial emissions, automobile exhaust and shipping (Burnett et al., 2004; Tob\u00edas et al., 2020). Biswas et al. (2019) reported that ambient NO2 is linked to many health hazards and its high concentrations can induce the formation of nitrate aerosols and acid rain. NO2 showed a significant decrease compared to the first period (before lockdown) when social and industrial activities were operating normally. Its rate reduction was much higher than those observed for PM10 and SO2. This could be explained by the fact that the emergency measures established by the Moroccan authorities, related to the cessation of industrial and transportation activities, had as a consequence a limitation in NO2 emission from both industrial production and vehicle exhaust, which has implicated a sharp decrease in NO2 concentrations during this period.",

It is the major precursor of nucleation formation of new particles in the atmosphere; and when these processes occur in populated regions, they could increase the human exposure to ultra-fine particles (Kulmala et al., 2004). For the present study, the variations in SO2 concentrations were not higher compared to those of PM10 and NO2 because: i) its levels appeared quite variable and significantly have decreased since the use, in 2009s, of fuel and lubricant oil with low sulphur contents; ii) commercial ships and incineration activities (industrial zone and pottery complex around the sampling site) closures due to pandemic prevention and control actions contribute significantly in the reduction of SO2 emissions.",

Indeed, the effects of reducing local air pollution on PM10 concentrations might still be limited due to the contribution of long-range transported particulate matter.",
