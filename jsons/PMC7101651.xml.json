The study period was from November 1, 2009 to May 31, 2011. Specimens were collected from nasal pharyngeal swabs. The tests were done at a laboratory operated under the auspices of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention with results available within 12 h of submission of the specimen. The PCR products were sequenced for further confirmation with the use of the BigDye Terminator, version 3.1 Cycle sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cytokine assay was performed according to the cytometric bead array (CBA) kit-BDTM CBA human Th1/Th2 cytokine kit II(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as described in the literature by Tang Y [2]. A National guideline, adapted from guidelines provided by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was published on October 10, 2009 and used to direct the surveillance, severity of illness, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Epidemiological and clinical information was collected included age, gender, pre-existing medical conditions, severity of illness, date of symptom onset, radiologic and laboratory findings, antiviral therapy, length of stay and complications associated with influenza. The research ethics board at Children\u2019s Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College approved the study design. Data were expressed in mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical evaluation was undertaken with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 15.0 for Windows).",
