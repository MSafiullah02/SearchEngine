Sequence-based HLA-B typing was performed using leukocytes isolated from 77 patients. Statistical analysis and a predictive discriminant analysis (PDA) were applied to typing data. Epitope prediction software was also applied to SEBOV sequences. Statistically significant associations were found between certain sets of alleles and either fatal or nonfatal disease outcomes. Alleles B*67 and B*15 were associated with fatal outcomes, whereas B*07 and B*14 were associated with nonfatal outcomes. The PDA-derived functions that were produced were 81.8% accurate in classifying patients into their correct outcome group. Several epitopes predicted to bind strongly to HLA-B*07 molecules were identified in the viral polymerase, nucleoprotein, and VP35 protein.

Humoral immunity appears to play only a minor role, if any, in surviving EBOV disease, because (1) antibody responses are characteristically delayed (i.e., they are absent early and usually are undetected in fatal cases) [5] , (2) passive transfer of antiserum has not been effective in protecting primates [6, 7] , and (3) antibody may actually enhance entry of EBOV into host cells [8] .

A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta), participating in an international effort to control this outbreak of SEBOV disease, provided on-site diagnostic testing of blood samples and observed the progression of disease in many patients. All persons infected with SEBOV showed signs and symptoms of disease (no asymptomatic cases were identified), yet some patients were observed to have disease of milder severity and shorter duration. Analysis of the acute-phase peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SEBOV-infected patients showed no significant difference in expression of cytokines, Fas, or Fas ligand when patients with fatal and nonfatal cases were compared with each other or were compared with uninfected, hospitalized patients [3] . However, persons with nonfatal outcomes differed from persons with fatal outcomes in that they had lower viral loads, as well as greater numbers of CD8 + T cells and activated (HLA-DR + ) CD8 + T cells [3, 11] . These findings suggested that the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is important in limiting SE-BOV replication and reducing disease severity. Because cellmediated immunity is likely to be a critical component in surviving SEBOV infections, it was postulated that the HLA class I composition of infected patients could influence the course of disease. To investigate this possibility, blood specimens collected from a variety of SEBOV-infected patients were used for sequence-based typing of the HLA-B locus (exons 2 and 3), the most divergent of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes. Fortunately, the large number of cases sampled and the \u223c50% fatality rate associated with the outbreak allowed statistical analysis to be performed on the data generated.

Survival is likely dependent on the rapid development of an effective CTL response that limits the level of virus replication before it can overwhelm the body, as is evidenced by increased numbers of activated (HLA-DR + ) CD8 + lymphocytes in patients with nonfatal cases [3] . As our study suggests, the MHC class I composition appears to be an important factor in disease outcome, and the presence of certain HLA-B alleles can confer either a protective advantage or a disadvantage in patients infected with SEBOV. Our findings indicate that ex- pression of the B*07 allele, which is highly associated with survival, confers a phenotype that efficiently drives T cell activation and CTL expansion early in the SEBOV infection, whereas alleles that are highly associated with fatalities (e.g., B*67 and B*15) contribute to an inefficient or unresponsive phenotype. One of the SEBOV-infected patients who survived had a B*07/B*15 profile (involving good and bad alleles), which suggests that, by itself, the B*07 allele may be sufficient to restrict SEBOV replication. With more data, one might be able to model the survival of patients with one good allele and one bad allele. However, in the present study, only 2 patients had such a profile, and, therefore, only univariate associations between allele type and patient survival were possible. Correlations between HLA composition and disease susceptibility or severity have been identified for other viral infections, including those due to HIV [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , herpes viruses [26, 27] , hepatitis B and C viruses [28] [29] [30] , dengue virus [31] , hantaviruses [32, 33] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [34, 35] . It has also been reported that HLA-B-restricted epitopes exhibit a greater functional avidity (T cell receptor avidity for HLA-peptide complex) than do HLA-Aor HLA-C-restricted epitopes [36] , which suggests a significant role for HLA-B alleles in acquired antiviral immunity.
