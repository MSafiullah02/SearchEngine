Acceleration in dual-use research of concern (DURC) and public availability of methods for DURC are gamechangers in biosecurity. DURC is research intended to benefit human health, but which can also inadvertently or deliberately harm people. Other vulnerabilities include lack of systems for differentiating natural and unnatural outbreaks, low awareness of the insider threat, and lack of intersectoral collaboration. The aim of this article is to examine traditional approaches to bioterrorism in the context of new challenges; and to outline potential approaches to improving biopreparedness in the era of DURC.",

Traditional approaches to bioterrorism are underpinned by the assumption that acts of bioterrorism, like a collapsing building, will be easily recognized. However, unless the event is related to an eradicated organism such as smallpox, even the most skilled experts cannot readily differentiate between unnatural and natural outbreaks when it involves a disease that occurs naturally. Experts need to firstly be open to the possibility, and secondly to have systems for flagging aberrant outbreak patterns.",

Ebola is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the 2014 West African outbreak displayed highly unusual features.1\u20133 For example, Ebola has never occurred in more than one country simultaneously previously, nor in capital cities.4 Further, two unrelated Ebola epidemics occurred at the same time in West Africa and The Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014, while an outbreak of Marburg virus simultaneously broke out in Uganda. Locals speculated about the origin of the 2014 Ebola epidemic being bioterrorism,5,6 yet this has been ignored in the public health response. Few nations have systematic mechanisms to assess re-emerging or emerging infections for potential bioterrorism, despite acceleration of science and accessibility of means for bioterrorism. An analysis of MERS-CoV shows that the pattern of disease fits with deliberate release,7 yet this possibility has not been seriously entertained. The geographic spread of the recently emerged H7N9 avian influenza is puzzling. In contrast to H5N1, H7N9 does not correspond to either wild bird flyways or poultry trading routes.8 The virus contains the same genetic mutations (which confers adaptation to humans), as engineered influenza viruses.8 Yet this H7N9 has also been assumed to be natural.",

Yet neither explanation was considered, despite Jim Weaver's warning. Even when Rajneesh confessed, he was not believed. This case study illustrates the inability of experts to interpret the data correctly, and the active resistance to considering bioterrorism as a cause. The normal human tendency is to force available facts to fit the dominant paradigm of thinking. Most food borne outbreaks are because of unsafe food handling, and this is the dominant paradigm for a field epidemiologist. Even experts may default to the dominant paradigm and override fact with belief. There is a need to train field epidemiologists to recognize unusual patterns and consider bioterrorism as a possibility. If the possibility is never entertained, it will never be detected. The Rajneesh case would have remained undetected if not for the unsolicited confession. The ridiculing of the 1 person who recognized bioterrorism and the silence around the case for more than a decade illustrate important lessons.",

It was anticipated in 2005 that the next pandemic virus may be related to avian H5N1.26 In 2011, two research groups completed research on engineering the H5N1 to make it transmissible in mammals. The rationale was to anticipate and understand the emergence of a H5N1 pandemic virus, and to enable vaccines and treatments. The risks include bioterrorism or a laboratory accident, either of which could spark an unnatural pandemic. These research groups sought to make their methods public in leading journals.27",

The impact of an epidemic can affect people who do not make an informed decision or consent to accepting the risk, so harm at a population level caused by DURC with epidemic potential is unique, and not something which ethics committees consider routinely. Although some organizations and countries have specific policies on DURC and mechanisms for oversight, this is by no means uniform or universal, and many gaps in accountability exist.

Risk analysis is very rarely used in public health, but could be incorporated into public health and epidemiology training. It may also be useful to have cross-sectoral training programs, where members of defense, police, and intelligence sectors spend time training in public health organizations and vice versa, as no other sector can replicate the critical mass of expertise in health. Placements in other agencies for training (such as defense and police trainees being placed in public health organizations and vice versa), will enhance mutual understanding and build enduring links to improve biosecurity. Vertical biosecurity programs in each sector are ineffective because the level of expertise required to deal with the public health aspects of bioterrorism is only available in large public health agencies.",

It also often assumes an ideological, political or religious motive, when the example of the insider threat shows that many other motives, including personal gain, may be at play. An important question to consider, particularly when reflecting on the insider threat and lessons from notable cases, is \u201cWho profits?\u201d Infectious disease is an industry, with many vested interest groups who could potentially profit from outbreaks. During an infectious diseases epidemic (such as Ebola), health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, researchers and other stakeholders, despite assumed good intentions, all stand to gain from the generation of business around the epidemic. It is na\u00efve to assume that all stakeholders in an infectious diseases emergency are driven universally by altruistic motives. For example, in the Ivins case, which remains unresolved, he shot to prominence as an expert initially assisting the FBI in their investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter bombs in the United States, and had patents on anthrax vaccines. Human nature is universal, and the factors involved in the insider threat as described for crime, apply equally to bioterrorism.19,20 It is timely to review simplistic assumptions about motives for bioterrorism, as well as the category A-B-C framework for bioterrorism preparedness, its relevance for current issues and threats, and to preparedness policy.",

It is sobering to reflect that in the Rajneesh case, the salmonella cultures were seized 12 months after the event, and that the Ivins investigation took almost 7 years. What if Rajneesh had been harboring smallpox, instead of Salmonella, in his laboratory? A pandemic or epidemic of a lethal infection would take days to weeks to spread around the world. It poses an unacceptably high risk to society if suspects are in possession of dangerous pathogens (such as Ebola, smallpox, or avian influenza) while investigations drag on for years. Given the reality of the insider threat and the demonstrated resistance of the scientific community to investigation of their own,18 traditional law enforcement approaches may not be suitable for investigating scientists suspected of bioterrorism. The insider threat must be acknowledged as a serious one in the era of DURC, and the rights of scientists should not outweigh the rights of the public if there is a risk of harm. It may be necessary to consider legislation which allows urgent intervention and precedence of the rights of the community over individual rights for suspected bioterrorism.",

Current paradigms of epidemic response do not routinely consider unnatural causes of outbreaks, and need to be reformed. The critical mass and skills required to respond to natural or unnatural epidemics cannot be replicated in nonhealth sectors, necessitating better collaboration between sectors. The ability to respond rapidly to bioterrorism threats once recognized, is further hampered by inadequate legislative frameworks. These problems combine to create major vulnerability in biosecurity within the current environment. Approaches to reducing risk include cross-sectoral training and capacity building in threat recognition, mechanisms for routine referral of aberrant epidemic patterns from public health agencies to law enforcement, better governance of DURC, awareness, and management of the insider threat, use of risk analysis calculations for regulating DURC, and improved legislation to allow rapid intervention for suspected bioterrorism. A quantum change in approach, collective, informed, transparent decision-making, and integrated cross-sectoral models of operation are required to improve global biopreparedness in a dangerous new era.",
