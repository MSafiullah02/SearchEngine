            "text": "Bovine torovirus (BToV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, was first detected in the USA during an outbreak of diarrhea in cattle in 1982 (Woode et al., 1982). Since then, epidemiological studies of BToV have shown that it is widespread throughout the world (Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Koopmans et al., 1991, Haschek et al., 2006, Hoet et al., 2002, Hoet et al., 2003, Liebler et al., 1992). An artificial inoculation trial also demonstrated the pathogenesis of BToV in cattle (Pohlenz et al., 1984, Woode et al., 1982). These data strongly suggest that BToV has relevance to diarrhea in cattle. However, no epidemiological research has been reported from Japan.",

            "text": "To detect BToV, electron microscopy (EM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed because this virus cannot be grown in cell culture (Koopmans et al., 1991, Liebler et al., 1992, Scott et al., 1996). PCR is more sensitive than ELISA, and its detectability is nearly identical to EM (Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Hoet et al., 2002). Consequently, the accumulation of a genetic database has progressed by analyzing gene products from different BToV isolates (Duckmanton et al., 1998b, Smits et al., 2003). The BToV genome consists of RNA polymerase, spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-estrase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) genes (Draker et al., 2006). In particular, the N and M coding regions show high homology among the published BToV isolates, but can distinguish them from coronavirus and other toroviruses (equine isolate Berne virus, porcine torovirus, human torovirus; Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994). Therefore, detecting BToV N and M genes is thought be the most sensitive and specific method for detecting BToV in fecal samples. The S gene is known to affect antigenicity in other coronaviruses (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). Therefore, analysis of the S gene in BToV positive samples is important in determining its antigenicity.",

Improvements in the detectability of BToV N, M, and S PCR products were observed in all samples by nested PCR as compared to first round PCR, suggesting the usefulness of this method in detecting BToV. The M gene could not be amplified from sample K-629, and this sample and sample K-643 were both negative for the S gene.

However, there have been several reports indicating the relationship of BToV and diarrhea in cattle.

There are few reports studying BToV, probably due to the fact that BToV cannot be yet propagated in cell culture. For the same reason, there are few reports characterizing BToV. In this study, we genetically characterized BToV samples by phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the BToV S gene, including the previously reported BRV-1, BRV-2, and B145 sequences. The detected BToVs were separated into three clusters. Cluster 2, which included samples K-674 and K-676, was located relatively closer to BRV-1. Cluster 1, the most frequently detected BToV cluster, was located distal to BRV-1, BRV-2, and B145. Cluster 3, which included samples K-683 and K-684, also seems to be separeted from these reference strains but relatively closer to cluster 1. In addition, high divergence was observed in the N sequence between the domestic samples and BRV-1 and BRV-2. These results raise the possibility that the predominant BToV in Japan are closer to the European strain B145 than to BRV-1 and BRV-2 regarding N gene properties. Therefore, it is important to identify the antigenic properties and to clarify their correlation with genetic properties.",
