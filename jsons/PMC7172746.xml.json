            "text": "In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to study the microbiota shed in the feces of different host species. The entirety of viruses present in the feces of a host is called the fecal virome and analysis of its composition in piglets is of great interest for several reasons. First, it allows investigators to distinguish viruses which can induce clinical disease (diarrhea), subclinical growth retardation, or even (apathogenic/benefical) viruses which do not cause symptoms. Second, some of the viruses shed in the feces of piglets can also cause zoonotic infections in humans and rotaviruses are a well described example (Martella et al., 2010, Zeller et al., 2012). In previous studies the fecal virome of healthy and diarrheic pigs has been investigated. Shan and colleagues reported the virome composition of healthy and diarrheic pigs on a high-density pig farm in North Carolina, United States. On average, 4.2 and 5.2 mammalian viruses were shed by non-diarrheic and diarrheic piglets, respectively. Most dominant viruses were kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses and teschoviruses. However, boca- and coronaviruses were more abundant in diarrheic animals (Shan et al., 2011). A process-controlled method, based on the addition of a defined amount of bacteriophages to allow for comparison between different samples, was applied by Sachsenr\u00f6der and colleagues to investigate the fecal virome retrieved from a pooled fecal sample of five 35 days old pigs. Two of five animals had diarrhea at the moment of sampling (Sachsenroder et al., 2012). Most viruses detected could be classified as bacteriophages (73.9%), mammalian viruses (23.9%) or plant viruses (0.8%). Kobuvirus, group C rotavirus, Chimpanzee stool associated circular ssDNA virus, astrovirus and enterovirus were the most abundant mammalian viruses found in this study (Sachsenroder et al., 2012). Zhang and colleagues reported the detection of 15 distinct mammalian viruses in a pooled fecal sample of 27 diarrheic piglets from China (Zhang et al., 2014). Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, sapovirus, bocavirus, sapelovirus and torovirus were most abundant (Zhang et al., 2014). To study the virome composition, standardized procedures that are useful in laboratory settings are needed. Recently, a standardized protocol for sample preparation, called NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), was established in our laboratory to allow researchers to apply high throughput viral metagenomics to study fecal viromes (Conceicao-Neto et al., 2015).",

The viral genome also encodes 6 different non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP6). The genus Rotavirus is subdivided into 9 different species (A to H) (Matthijnssens et al., 2012).

            "text": "Group A rotaviruses (RVA) have been considered as clinically and epidemiologically most important RV species in humans and animals, including pigs. Due to its segmented genome, reassortant viruses can be created upon dual infection of a single cell with different virus strains. To detect such a reassortment event and to characterize rare RVA strains in human surveillance studies, a full genome-based classification system was established for RVAs (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Matthijnssens et al., 2008b). The outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 are important in this classification system, as they can induce the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, intracellular neutralizing antibodies targeting VP6 may also play an important role in clearing RVA infections (Aiyegbo et al., 2014, Aiyegbo et al., 2013). Many VP7 (n = 28) and VP4 (n = 39) genotypes have been detected in multiple species (Matthijnssens et al., 2011, Matthijnssens and Theuns, 2015, Trojnar et al., 2013). In pigs, a large diversity of VP7/VP4 genotypes can be encountered (Amimo et al., 2013, Chandler-Bostock et al., 2014, Collins et al., 2010, Martella et al., 2005, Papp et al., 2013, Pham et al., 2014). As an example, six different G-genotypes for VP7 (G2, G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11), and five different P-genotypes for VP4 (P[6], P[7], P[13], P[23] and P[27]) were recently encountered in 12 different G/P combinations in feces from Belgian diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets (Theuns et al., 2014). Overall, these pig RVA strains possessed a relatively conserved pig genetic backbone for the other 9 gene segments, namely I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1, which demonstrated a clear evolutionary relationship with genes of dominant human Wa-like RVA strains (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Theuns et al., 2015).",

A genotype classification system for RVC VP7 encoding genes has been established. Pig strains typically belong to genotypes G1, G3, G5, G6-G10, whereas human and cow RVCs belong to genotypes G4 and G2, respectively (Marthaler et al., 2013). Recently, two different VP4 nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values have been established to assign RVC strains into specific VP4 genotypes (Jeong et al., 2015, Suzuki et al., 2014a). Similar nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values have been identified to classify RVC VP6 genes into distinct genotypes (Jeong et al., 2015, Suzuki et al., 2014b). Still, only a limited number of RVC gene sequences have been analyzed to date and only one complete porcine RVC genome is available. This hampers not only our understanding of RVC evolution in different host species, but also the development of a consensus full-genome characterization system for RVC (Bremont et al., 1992, Mawatari et al., 2014, Soma et al., 2013, Yamamoto et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Porcine astrovirus (PoAstV), a member of the genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae is often detected during viral metagenomics studies (Sachsenroder et al., 2012, Shan et al., 2011). Cross-neutralization assays have been applied to classify astroviruses into different serotypes, but this has been hampered by the lack of viral growth in cell culture. Nowadays, classification is more often performed using genetic analysis of ORF2, which is the most variable astrovirus gene (De Benedictis et al., 2011, Lee and Kurtz, 1982). Still, the current classification is not able to cope with the wide genetic diversity among porcine astroviruses. It also remains difficult to associate these infections with disease, as these viruses have also been isolated from healthy pigs as well (De Benedictis et al., 2011, Mor et al., 2012, Xiao et al., 2013). This is in contrast to humans, where some species have been associated with diarrhea (De Benedictis et al., 2011, Jarchow-Macdonald et al., 2015, Medici et al., 2014, Xavier Mda et al., 2015). Other species of astroviruses have also been identified in cases of encephalitis in humans and cattle (Bouzalas et al., 2014, De Benedictis et al., 2011, Li et al., 2013, Naccache et al., 2015, Seuberlich et al., 2016). Interestingly, adenoviruses have also been recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in Irish children (Lennon et al., 2007). Also for enteroviruses in piglets, the role in the development of diarrhea is being questioned, while they are very often detected in the virome of piglets. Porcine enteroviruses belong to the species enterovirus G within the genus Enterovirus of the Picornaviridae family. Originally, porcine teschovirus and porcine sapelovirus were considered as distinct serotypes within the genus enterovirus, but they are now considered as distinct genera (Adams et al., 2013).",

This strain contained the rare pig G11P[27] genotype combination for VP7 and VP4. A much higher load of an RVC strain (9.56 log10 copies/g feces) was later identified in this sample. Therefore, it was decided to unravel the entire virome content of this interesting fecal sample by means of NGS. It was aimed to reveal the second complete genome of a pig RVC strain. The evolutionary relationship between the RVC strain from the pig and those of other host species was investigated to better assess the risk for future interspecies transmission and reassortment events between pig and other RVC strains. Furthermore, the future application of NGS in pig veterinary diagnostics is being discussed.",

Using NGS it was possible to obtain the complete genome sequence of a Belgian pig RVC, and this will help us to better understand their evolution. This strain was genetically distinct from pig strain Cowden and RVCs from humans and cows. Generally, most RVC gene segments clearly clustered according to the host species of origin. Unfortunately, only 2 pig RVC strains have been fully characterized to date, and both are genetically very divergent from each other, a characteristic which is less pronounced in human and bovine RVC strains (Bremont et al., 1992, Mawatari et al., 2014, Soma et al., 2013, Yamamoto et al., 2011). To date, it is not possible to conclude for any ancestral roles between pig, cow and human RVCs. Analysis of more complete genomes of RVC strains from different host species should give answers to these questions. However, at least for the RVC VP3 gene, a closer relationship between genes from pig and human RVCs can be suggested, as pig RVCs clustered in between two human VP3 subclusters (Yamamoto et al., 2011).",

As alternative, genetic classification methods have been developed, but only for a limited number of RVC gene segments and being the most elaborate for those encoding outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, and inner capsid protein VP6 (Marthaler et al., 2013, Suzuki et al., 2014a, Suzuki et al., 2014b). The VP7 encoding gene of RVC strain 12R021 belonged to genotype G3, which was only discovered in a relatively small number of pig RVC strains from South Korea and Ohio, United States (Amimo et al., 2013, Jeong et al., 2015). In a large study from the United States and Canada, the G3 genotype was not found in diarrheic pigs (Marthaler et al., 2013). Furthermore, in a recent study conducted in Belgian diarrheic suckling piglets, the G3 genotype was not found (Theuns et al., 2016). In general, genotypes G6 and G1 are most dominant in the pig population (Jeong et al., 2015, Marthaler et al., 2013, Theuns et al., 2016). Tsunemitsu et al. (1992) demonstrated that one of these G3 strains (HF), likely belonged to a distinct serotype than strain Cowden (genotype G1) and Shintoku (genotype G2). This may indicate that strain 12R021 is not only genetically, but also serologically distinct from most other pig, human and cow RVC strains isolated to date (Tsunemitsu et al., 1992). However, this hypothesis needs further investigation using relevant enterocyte cell culture models.",

            "text": "Here, a large genetic diversity was also observed among VP4 encoding genes of pig and cow RVC strains, which was in large contrast to the high relatedness among human RVC VP4 genes. Recently, two research groups proposed distinct nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values to divide VP4 genes into distinct genotypes. Jeong and colleagues used an 83% cut-off value to classify the genes into 7 genotypes (P1 to P7), whereas Suzuki and colleagues used a cut-off value of 80% to distinguish 6 genotypes (P1 to P6). Still, it is difficult to find a consensus for all genotypes between both classification systems, which hampers the correct classification of new RVC strains, especially those of pigs. The genotype P5 is shared between both classification systems, and contained the Belgian pig strain. It has been demonstrated for the RVA VP4 proteins that the highly variable VP8* domain within VP4 possesses the capacity to recognize different carbohydrate moieties dependent on the genotype (Coulson, 2015). As an example, strains bearing the typical pig genotype P[7] recognize sialic acids, whereas differences in carbohydrate recognition have been observed between important human RVA genotypes P[6] and P[8] (Huang et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2012, Nordgren et al., 2014). RVCs also possess a highly variable VP8* domain. The dependence on sialic acids for binding and infection of cells was shown earlier for pig strain Cowden. This strain was also capable of hemagglutinating human type O, guinea pig and mouse red blood cells (Svensson, 1992). Still, it might be that the diversity observed among genes encoding VP4 proteins of contemporary pig RVC strains results in the capacity to recognize and bind to a wider range of carbohydrate moieties present on mucus and enterocytes. In contrast to the high diversity of VP4 genes of pig RVCs, it is more likely that human RVCs only use a single conserved type of carbohydrate for attachment, as they are genetically much more related to each other.",

Also here, no consensus has yet been reached. As such, 12R021 can be seen as a tentative new genotype, together with strains from the Czech Republic. For pig RVAs, and for human RVAs from different genogroups, it was described that genotype-specific mutations were present at the VP7 interface of the VP6 proteins (Heiman et al., 2008, Theuns et al., 2015). The diversity observed among pig RVCs might have similar purposes. First, it may allow for a better recognition of different VP7/VP4 proteins encoded by different genotypes, resulting in a better structural fit in mature particles. Second, the high diversity observed in VP6 might be the cause of immunological selection pressure as well. Indeed, VP6 proteins have an important immunological function which has long been underestimated. For RVAs it was demonstrated that the majority of antibodies are elicited against VP6, and unexpectedly less against the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 (Svensson et al., 1987). Anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are internalized at the basal side of enterocytes, undergo transcytosis, followed by excretion in the lumen as secretory IgA (SIgA). During transcytosis, antibodies against the RVA VP6 proteins are able to intracellularly neutralize viral replication by sterical blocking of type I channels in viral double layered particles, thereby hampering RNA egress during transcription (Aiyegbo et al., 2013). A similar mechanism might be in place for RVC, whereas a wide diversity among VP6 proteins allow the viruses to evade immune pressure. The availability of RVC susceptible cells will allow us to investigate these hypotheses.",

A rare pig G11P[27] genotype combination was found for VP7 and VP4, but this strain was only present at a low viral load (4.79 log10 copies/g feces). Here it was attempted to reveal the entire genome of this strain, which was only partially successful. This was most likely due to the low viral load of the RVA strain in the fecal sample. Another hypothesis might be that most of the excreted RVA RNA was unprotected by virions, and thus digested by the RNase digestion step during the viral purification step for NGS preparation. For successful RT-PCR amplification of some gene segments, concentration of the RNA extracts using ethanol precipitation was necessary, and typical pig genotypes I5, A8 and T7 could be assigned to some of the genes, including those encoding the inner capsid protein (VP6), the interferon antagonist (NSP1) and the translation enhancer (NSP3), respectively. Similar pig genotypes have been disclosed from other pig RVA strains around the world, and have recently also been detected in Belgian pig strains (Ghosh et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2012, Martel-Paradis et al., 2013, Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Matthijnssens et al., 2010, Monini et al., 2014, Okitsu et al., 2013, Shi et al., 2012, Theuns et al., 2015). It was suggested that proteins encoded by these pig genotypes may allow for a better match with the cellular machinery of the pig intestinal epithelial cells during viral replication (Theuns et al., 2015). Furthermore, our RVA strain also possessed an N1 NSP2 genotype, further confirming the evolutionary relationship between pig RVAs and human Wa-like RVAs (Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Theuns et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Finally, results from this study also highlight that many viral species may reside in the intestine of piglets without even being noticed using traditional diagnostic approaches (Sachsenroder et al., 2012, Sachsenroder et al., 2014, Shan et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2014). Indeed, most viral species are not routinely investigated in cases of diarrhea on pig farms. Here, a porcine astrovirus was detected in the fecal virome, which showed most similarity to a porcine astrovirus strain from Hungary. The clinical relevance of these astroviruses remains enigmatic and should be further investigated. A porcine enterovirus was also present in the fecal virome, but also for enteroviruses in piglets their role in the development of enteric diseases is being questioned in piglets, and have been more frequently associated with neurological problems and reproductive problems in pigs (Knowles, 2006). Indeed, the roles of PoAstV and the porcine enterovirus in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea can also be questioned here, as this piglet did not demonstrate any symptoms of diarrhea at the moment of sampling. Still, these subclinical infections may have had an impact on pig growth, which has been ascribed for instance to porcine circovirus infections (Maes, 2012). Nonetheless, the detection of all these viruses provided only a picture at one time-point, and the history and outcome of these infections is unknown. In view of future studies in the field, analyses of the fecal viromes of diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets will likely enable the discovery of new viruses that are part of yet unspecified intestinal disease complexes. These might contribute to clinical enteric diseases or result in growth retardation in subclinically infected young piglets. Standardized protocols, which allow studying viral metagenomics in a high throughput manner without introducing major bias (such as the NetoVIR protocol), are definitely needed to execute such studies (Conceicao-Neto et al., 2015). This will eventually lead to innovative diagnostic protocols and control measures of (sub)clinical enteric infections in young pigs.",
