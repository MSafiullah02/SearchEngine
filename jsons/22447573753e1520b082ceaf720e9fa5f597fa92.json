The consequences of a pandemic can significantly affect and disrupt a large spectrum of workforce sectors in today's society. This paper, motivated by the impact of a pandemic, extends the formulation of the dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM) to account for economic perturbations resulting from such an event, which creates a time-varying and probabilistic inoperability to the workforce. A pandemic is a unique disaster, because the majority of its direct impacts are workforce related and it does not create significant direct impact to infrastructure. In light of this factor, this paper first develops a method of translating unavailable workforce into a measure of economic-sector inoperability. While previous formulations of the DIIM only allowed for the specification of an initial perturbation, this paper incorporates the fact that a pandemic can cause direct effects to the workforce over the recovery period. Given the uncertainty associated with the impact of a pandemic, this paper develops a simulation framework to account for the possible variations in realizations of the pandemic. The enhancements to the DIIM formulation are incorporated into a MatLab program and then applied to a case study to simulate a pandemic scenario in the Commonwealth of Virginia.",

The Leontief input-output (I-O) model is a particular method for modeling interdependencies across multiple sectors of a given regional economy [6] , [7] . Extensions and current frontiers on I-O analysis can be found in [8] . It is worth noting that the traditional use of I-O analysis for estimating the effects of economic shifts (e.g., changes in consumption) has been extended to other applications such as disaster risk management, environmental impact analysis, and energy consumption, among others. Various studies for estimating losses pursuant to disasters have employed traditional I-O analysis and extended approaches such as computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. Rose and Liao [9] conducted a case study of water-supply disruption scenarios in Portland; they used CGE to account for resilience factors (e.g., substitution and conservation) that business sectors typically consider in order to minimize potential losses. Rose [10] describes that CGE is an extension rather than a replacement of the traditional I-O model. Other disaster-related applications of I-O and CGE models include [11] - [13] .",

Fig. 2 shows a summary of the inoperability for all sectors over the duration of the pandemic and the time to recover to 1% of maximum inoperability. An interesting behavior of the graph is that the peak inoperability of any sector at any time is around 14%. This means that the 14% inoperability level reflects the growing inoperability in the sector due to sustained levels of absent workforce.",

This is seen more clearly in Fig. 3 , a plot of the inoperability of the top ten most inoperable sectors. Right at day 28 (the end of the pandemic), the inoperability begins to recover very rapidly, particularly relative to its previous behavior. These results can again be traced back to the FluWorkLoss inputs, which instantaneously drop from 2% inoperability to zero. Thus, at that point, the model begins to recover as though every person returned to work. In terms of sectors most impacted by the pandemic, Fig. 3 shows that the top ten sectors in terms of inoperability are the following (in order): 1) other services; 2) educational services; 3) funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles; 4) management of companies and enterprises; 5) professional, scientific, and technical services; 6) motor vehicle, body, trailer, and part manufacturing; 7) securities commodity contracts and investments; 8) ambulatory health care services; 9) air transportation; and 10) amusements, gambling, and recreation.",

A unique contribution of the current paper is incorporating probabilistic and temporal extensions   TABLE I  ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE THREE SCENARIOS OF THE CASE STUDY to the well-established economic I-O model. In particular, we explicitly incorporate recovery and uncertainty bounds for estimating the adverse economic effects resulting from a workforce debilitating disaster, such as a pandemic. Economic loss estimates provide policymaking insights (e.g., evaluating feasible mitigation strategies via cost-benefit analyses). The remainder of this section provides discussions on the interplay between sector-specific consequences and risk-management policymaking.",

Additionally, many of the sectors have reliance on workforce values that are similar or higher than these two sectors. Thus, this paper provides just one of the pieces in determining how to prioritize the protection of sectors. Many other factors need to be considered as well; for example, the health and hospital sectors will probably play a very large role in containing the outbreak and minimizing the number of infections and death rate.
