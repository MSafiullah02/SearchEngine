At the beginning of the outbreak, states reported high transmissibility and lower doubling time. National lockdown was implemented from 24th March 2020. The effective R0 in several states has come down by the adopted curtailment strategies / lockdown compared to what was estimated at the beginning of the epidemic. As the final epidemics size's relation with R0 is exponential and not linear, this reduction if sustained may considerably decrease the total number of affected persons compared to initial estimates. However, two factors should be considered at this moment. Firstly, effective reproduction numbers (R t ) need to be further reduced in-order to flatten or change the direction of the epidemic curve it may be perceived state-wise variations in its magnitude. Secondly, although the doubling time has increased in relative terms, the epidemic still follows an exponential trajectory and the current daily incidence is much more as compared to beginning of the epidemic.",

This reduction can mainly be explained by reduced number of contacts among people owing to movement restrictions. Studies on the impact of lockdown in other countries also reported reduction in reproductive number which translates in to flattening of the curve and delaying of peak. (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Yet as mentioned earlier, the effective R0 estimations are dynamic and may change over age structure, time and nature of intervention. Continuing nationwide lockdown at this scale and with the same intensity may not be further possible for the government because of collateral implications in long term .Therefore, in the post-lockdown era, it might be a challenge to maintain this path and this may be the period where the absolute burden of the infected persons will be high. (20, 21) There remains a higher reported probability of serious infections (including intensive care) in geriatric population compared to younger adults. (22) This coupled with the higher prevalence of comorbid conditions (~50%) in individuals over 60 years in India may warrant a strategy tailored to this section of population .

Containment strategies like lockdown has given us the much-needed opportunity to delay the peak flatten the epidemic-curve. The time bought should be utilized to intensify the surveillance among 'at-risk' individuals and buttress the health infrastructure including hospital beds with oxygen availability and critical care beds with ventilators and telemedicine.(24-26)",

Nationwide lockdown began from 24th March 2020 onwards. It had restrictions on non-essential travel, prohibition of mass gatherings etc. In spite of assumed uniform susceptibility of Indian population to COVID-19, the trends till now are showing a variegated force of infection in different states. It is important to capture these state specific variations as they may offer important insights into the current mitigation strategies. This is specifically contextual in amidst of lockdown strategy adopted by the country to curtail the impact and flatten the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.(3-5) the quantification of which may aid to plan future intervention strategies. The scope of this manuscript is to estimate the basic/effective reproduction number (R0) and doubling time at 15 days into the lockdown (early epidemic) and at day-30 of the lockdown to see the cumulative effect of curtailment strategies (inclusive of lockdown) in selected states. The 10 states reporting highest numbers of COVID-19 cases as on 23 rd April, 2020 were chosen for this analysis. The database used for the analysis is in opendomain at www.covid19india.org. R0 and doubling time are chosen in view of their primary role in reflecting the force, consistency and continuity of an infectious disease which is critically important in COVID-19.",
