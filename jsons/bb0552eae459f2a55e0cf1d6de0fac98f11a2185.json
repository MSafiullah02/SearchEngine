Our laboratory showed that an experimental murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted into the brain by intranasal or intracerebral exposure and that neurovirulence is mediated by cytokine secretion. In this study we investigated which cells in the brain produce cytokines, thus functioning as the brain's innate immune system. Using tissue cultures of microglia, and clonal populations of astrocytes, we found that microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III), produced proinflammatory cytokines in response to MHV-A59 infection. A molecularly closely related, nonencephalitic strain of the virus (MHV-2) caused in vitro infection, but without cytokine induction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that type I astrocytes and microglia have perivascular foot processes necessary for the formation of the perivascular glymphatic system, the anatomical site of the brain's innate immune system.",

The coronavirus genus of viruses belongs to the coronaviridae family of the nidovirales order that produce a variety of hepatic, enteric, and neurologic diseases in animals, and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans (Cavanagh, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Lavi et al., 1999; Lavi and Weiss, 1989) . In 2003 a virulent coronavirus infection caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), followed by middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Peiris et al., 2003) . In 2019, a new human coronavirus emerged, named MHV-A59 is a member of the coronavirus genus that with intracerebral or intranasal exposure in mice produces a bi-phasic disease with acute hepatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease. While the acute phase of the disease is associated with direct viral replication and antigen expression in the brain and liver, the chronic, immunemediated, demyelinating disease is associated with rare RNA persistence in the brain, without evidence of direct viral replication or antigen expression. Demyelination was found to be molecularly controlled by a region in the S1 portion of the spike glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59, downstream from the receptor binding domain, based on mutational analysis and the finding that a single point mutation (Asparagine to Serine in position 345 of S gene) abolished demyelination completely (Das Sarma, et al., 2000; Das Sarma, et al. 2001a; Fu et al. 2004; Fu and Lavi, 2005) . MHV-2 in comparison, is a hepatotropic virus causing hepatitis, and mild meningitis without encephalitis, even when inoculated intracerebrally. Neurovirulence and the ability of MHV to cause encephalitis is directly related to its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, both in vivo and in vitro (Li et al., 2004) . The present investigation determined that infection with the encephalitic strain MHV-A59 produced a pro-inflammatory cytokine reaction of the innate immune system mediated by microglia and type I astrocytes. This is in contrast to the non-encephalitic strain (MHV-2) which did not produce a cytokine response. It is therefore concluded that a cytokine response determines the ability of the virus to cause encephalitis.",

In general, the cytokine response in type I astrocytes was consistent with a TH1and TH17 response (role in pro-inflammation and autoimmunity). The cytokine response profile in microglia was primarily involving IL-6, interferons and TNF. IL-6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof in its initial response is also pro-inflammatory; although, it can also serve at later stages of infection as inducer of IL-10 and anti-inflammatory reaction. Thus, the profiles of the cytokine response in both cell types were complementary and aimed at inducing a pro-inflammatory reaction that would enable a cellular inflammatory reaction to enter the CNS and be directed against the invading virus.

It is well known that astrocytic foot processes surround brain capillaries and during development induce endothelial cells to form tight junctions which are the basis for the blood brain barrier. The immune reaction in the brain originates in a perivascular structure, known as the glymphatic system, because of its similarity to the systemic lymphatic system. The morphology of the cultured type I astrocytes appears to be identical to the morphology of human perivascular astrocytes that send their foot processes to the blood vessels. The morphology of these perivascular astrocytes is clearly different from the cultured type II or type III. In addition, we found immunohistochemical evidence in human tissue that microglia also send processes that are in close proximity to endothelial cells, likely participating with astrocytes type I in the perivascular structure. The combination of the morphological study with the function of cytokine production suggests that type I astrocytes and microglia form the perivascular glymphatic system that is involved in an innate immune reaction by the secretion of cytokines following a neurotropic encephalitic viral infection. A graphic illustration of the perivascular role of type I astrocytes and microglia in the blood brain barrier and glymphatic system is shown in Figure 5 .",
