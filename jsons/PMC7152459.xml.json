In defining the etiology, it is helpful to define cough types in accordance to different constructs. Pediatric cough can be classified in several constructs based on (1) timeframe (acute, chronic), (2) likelihood of an identifiable underlying primary etiology (e.g., specific and nonspecific cough), and (3) characteristic (wet versus dry). For clinical practicality, timeframe is commonly used, divided into acute (< 2 weeks), subacute (2 to 4 weeks) and chronic (> 4 weeks) cough. No studies have clearly defined when cough should be defined as chronic (variably defined from > 4 to 8 weeks).6, 7, 8 Cough related to an upper acute respiratory infection (ARI) resolves within 10 days in 50% of children and by 25 days in 90%;12 Arguably, childhood chronic cough should be defined as persistent daily cough of > 4 weeks. This duration includes a \u201csafety factor\u201d in the recognition that foreign body airway aspiration is not uncommon in children, and thus a systematic approach is required in those with chronic cough because they are likely to have a complicated ARI or other etiology.",

Cohort studies on children with chronic cough have shown that cough resolution was still achieved in children exposed to ETS,13,\n14 including a cohort with high exposure rates (56%).13 This suggests that, while ETS is undoubtedly associated with increased coughing illnesses and is an important contributing factor, ETS alone is not the sole etiology. Other exacerbation factors include exposure to other pollutants15 and secondary gain from having a cough (e.g., attention from parents, missing school).",

It is a nonprecise term and often overlaps with other conditions of the respiratory tract. The most common cause of acute cough, acute bronchitis is caused by viral ARIs.18 Fifty-six percent of children with ARI are still unwell 4 days after initial consultation. The percentage decreases to 26% on the 7th day and to 6% by the 14th day.19 However, cough was not specifically reported in the study.19 A systematic review on the natural history of acute cough in children 0 to 4 years of age in primary care reported that the majority of children improve with time, but 5% to 10% progress to develop protracted bronchitis or pneumonia.20 A prospective community-based study in 600 families in Melbourne, Australia,21 found that most acute bronchitis episodes last 2 to 5 days. Leder and colleagues21 also described that children younger than 2 years of age were more likely to have at least one respiratory infection, a higher number of episodes per person, and the longest episode duration (6.8 days).21 The frequency of ARIs was age-dependent, with a reduction in incidence with increasing age. Yearly rate per person was 3.8 in children 0 to 1 years of age; 3.3 in children 2 to 3 years of age; 2.8 in children 4 to 5 years of age; 2.2 in children 6 to 10 years of age; and 2 in children 11 to 20 years of age.21 Bearing in mind the different definitions and sampling frames, studies from developing countries show higher rates of ARIs (3.7 to 14.9 per child per year).21\n",

However, only viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma, and chlamydia are considered in the clinical phenotype of acute bronchitis. Respiratory viruses are the most common etiology.22,\n18 Importantly, 17% to 33% of infections involve co-infections with (single or multiple) viruses or bacteria.23,\n24 In developed countries, both viral and bacterial infections are likely to be self-limited. Common respiratory viruses in children are human rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (A and B), parainfluenza (1 to 3), influenza, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).18 In birth cohort studies,22 the most common respiratory pathogens were found to be HRV, followed by RSV and coronavirus. More and more new respiratory viruses are being identified, and recent additions include subtypes of HRV, human enteroviruses (HEVs), and human parechoviruses (HPeVs).25 Although some viruses are more commonly associated with certain syndromes (e.g., RSV causes bronchiolitis and parainfluenza causes croup), any of these respiratory pathogens can cause acute bronchitis. With modern molecular techniques, co-infections are also found25 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children.18,\n26 In a study on children with asthma exacerbations, viral co-detections occurred in 25.6% of children.27 While co-infections were associated with lower asthma quality of life scores upon presentation than were single viral detections, the recovery phase (including symptoms of acute bronchitis) was not influenced by the presence or absence of virus.25 There is no consensus in the literature about the relationship between clinical severity and co-detection of viruses. Persistence of symptoms is most likely to indicate a bacterial infection, either as a consequence of altered immunity from the initial viral insult28 or a primary infection.29\n",

However when they do, children need to be assessed adequately for other respiratory etiologies (e.g., inhalation of a foreign body) and other infections (e.g., pneumonia and bronchiolitis). Complications develop in 8% to 12% of children with upper ARIs.12 Fever alone, or fever with chest signs was found to be good predictors for complications in children with cough. However, the discriminatory ability is weak30 and, to date, there is insufficient data to predict who will develop complications of acute bronchitis. Acute cough may also be the presenting symptom of an underlying disorder, and the presence of specific pointers (Table 26-2\n) should alert practitioners to the possibility of an underlying problem (e.g., a congenital/developmental respiratory or immunologic disorder). Differentiating uncomplicated ARIs from pneumonia has been relatively widely studied in developing countries where chest wall retractions and respiratory rate are good predictors of pneumonia.31 Use of chest radiographs does not improve outcome in ambulatory children with acute lower respiratory infection.32\n",

However, colonization may be secondary to conditions that impair cough such as neuromuscular disease, mucus plugging in asthmatics, airway lesions that impede efficient airway clearance (e.g., tracheobronchomalacia), or mucosal damage secondary to aspiration. Tracheobronchomalacia is a common finding in children with PBB,14 which may be a primary phenomenon (airway malacia predisposes to PBB through reduced efficiency in airway clearance) or a secondary phenomenon (malacia occurs as a consequence of intense airway inflammation).48 Persistent airway colonization and neutrophilic inflammation may evolve to chronic mucus hypersecretion and further airway inflammation. In some cases, cumulative airway injury from recurrent or persistent bacterial infection can lead to bronchiectasis.45 Repeated microbial exposure, especially during childhood, likely shapes later immune system responses.49\n",

Type II, or acellular casts, consist mainly of mucin with a few cells and usually occur following surgery for congenital cardiac defects.56 However analysis of casts may not fit neatly into either category.57 Many etiologic factors have been associated with plastic bronchitis; these include cardiac defects (particularly after Fontan's procedure),58 sickle cell disease (acute chest syndrome),59 asthma, aspergillosis, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis,60 pulmonary lymphatic disorders,57 and neoplastic infiltrates.61 The pathogenesis of cast formation is unknown but probably involves abnormal mucin accumulation, with reduced airway clearance and dehydration, in a genetically predisposed person.57\n",
