Its main protease (M pro ) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free M pro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 M pro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 M pro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of M pro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 M pro . * Correspondence to estrada66@unizar.es 1 of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.",

This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue.

This disease-produced by a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 [3] -has become pandemic in about three months, affecting more than 200 countries around the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus [4, 5] , to which the virus which produced the respiratory epidemic of 2003 (nowadays known as SARS-CoV-1) also belongs to. The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with SARS CoV-1. In spite of this similarity and of the fact that SARS-CoV-1 appeared almost 20 years ago, there are currently no approved specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7, 8, 9] . In consequence, most of the clinical treatment used against the disease is symptomatic in combination with some repurposed drugs, such as the antiviral Remdesivir or the antimalarials chloquine [10] and hidroxychloroquine [11] . This situation urges the scientific community to search for specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

They share 96% of amino acids sequence, i.e., they differ in the amino acids at only 12 out of 303 positions in the sequence. Zhang et al. [13] have reported that the superposition of the chain A of two structures corresponding to the main proteases of SARS CoV-1 and of SARS CoV-2, namely 2BX4 and 6Y2E, respectively, shows a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of only 0.53 \u00c5 for all C \u03b1 positions. The first question that emerges here is whether such similarities are also reflected at the topological structural level of the proteins. By topological we mean here the discrete topology emerging from a network theoretic representation of a protein. In this representation of the protein structure the nodes of the network represent amino acids and the edges connecting them indicate that the corresponding residues are at a distance in which they can interact to each other. Because the Euclidean distance between the amino acids is used to construct the network we more correctly should refer to this framework as topographical more than topological. This network theoretic representation has been previously used to answer several questions related to protein structure and functioning [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Among the tools in use, the one of node centrality [23, 24] has played a fundamental role (see for instance [22] . These indices capture the relative importance-both structural and dynamical-of an individual amino acid in the protein.",

We can observe in this Table that most of the topological characteristics of the first kind of the PRNs of both proteases are very similar with relative differences not bigger than 2% for all the properties analyzed. In order to test the significance of the differences between the two groups of 7 proteases we use the p-values of the Mann-Whitney U-test [42] . This statistical measure has been proposed for the analysis of network measures, in particular for protein networks [43, 44] . According to the p-values (see last column in Table 2 ) none of these measures display significant difference between the two groups of proteases. We then continue the analysis by comparing the topological measures of the second kind. We notice that the eigenvector centrality, which has been found very useful in previous analysis of PRN [22] , does not display any significant difference between both proteases according to the Mann-Whitney test. However, there are differences in the mean subgraph centrality of about 14% and of the average communicability between pairs of nodes of about 18%. In both cases, the indices are significantly larger for the protease of SARS CoV-2 than for that of SARS CoV-1. According to the p-values these differences are significant at 94% level of confidence in the Mann-Whitney U-test. This means that the structural changes that make the difference between the proteases of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 increase the capacity of the individual amino acids of feeling a perturbation or thermal oscillation produced in another amino acid of the protein. As we have previously explained these communicability factors penalizes very heavily any perturbation being transmitted between two amino acids separated by a relatively long distance in the protein. Thus, they can be considered as indices that account for shorter range interactions than the third kind measures considered here. It should be noticed that although the communicability angles display very little relative variation between the two groups of proteases, these differences are significant at 94% of confidence in the Mann-Whitney test.",

            "text": "Both LR subgraph centrality and communicability display dramatic increment in SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1. In this case the increase of these indices is more than 1900% for both, the LR communicability and LR subgraph centrality. In short, this means that the protease of SARS CoV-2 has measure SARS CoV-1 SARS CoV-2 more than 13 times more capacity of transmitting perturbations between pairs of nodes than the protease of SARS CoV-1. This is equivalent to say that the protease of SARS CoV-2 is significantly much more topologically efficient in transmitting \"information\" among its amino acids than the protease of SARS CoV-1. These two topological measures display significant differences between the two groups of proteases according to the statistical p-values obtained from the Mann-Whitney U-test at 94% of confidence. We now proceed to the analysis of the local variation of the subgraph and the LR subgraph centralities for the amino acids of the two M pro (see Fig. 2 ) averaged for all the structures previously mentioned, i.e., 2H2Z, 1UJ1, 2DUC, 2BX4 for SARS CoV-1 and 6M03, 6Y2E, 6M2Q for SARS CoV-2. In the case of the subgraph centrality the largest change is produced for a few amino acids which increase their centrality in SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1. These are the cases of 25, 26, 27, 118, 17, and 24. But there are also other amino acids which drop their centrality in SARS CoV-2, such as 170, 73, 169, 165, 89, and 252 among others (see Fig. 2(b) ). Therefore, the increase of the subgraph centrality of a few amino acids makes that in total the average subgraph centrality increases in SARS CoV-2 in relation to SARS CoV-1. An important characteristic feature of the differences in this centrality between the two proteases is that they are spread across the three domains of the proteases with a large increment in the domains I and III. This is a major difference with the LR subgraph centrality (see Figs. 2(c) and (d)), where the main change is a dramatic increase in the centrality of the nodes in the domains I and II of the SARS CoV-2 protease relative to SARS CoV-1. The changes occurring in the domain III are imperceptible in relation to those of the other two domains. 32 In order to illustrate the distributions of the most central amino acids according to both measures in the three-dimensional structures of the proteases we selected two structures, 2BX4 for SARS CoV-1 and 6Y2E for SARS CoV-2 as representative of the two groups of structures. Notice that these two structures have been used by Zhang et al. [13] for their comparison of the 3D structures of both proteases. Both structures are illustrated in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the largest values of the LR subgraph centrality are concentrated in a relatively small region of the protein structure, while those of the subgraph centrality are more spread across the whole structure. We then inquire about this region of the M pro in SARS CoV-2 which shows the largest change in the LR subgraph centrality relative to its analogue of SARS CoV-1.",

            "text": "The first remarkable observation of the amino acids with the largest change in the LR subgraph centrality is that they are all closely separated to each other in the three-dimensional space. For instance, the 22 amino acids displaying the largest change in this centrality form a connected subgraph of the PRN as illustrated in Fig. 4 . This subgraph of 22 nodes has 48 connections among these amino acids, which produces an edge density of 0.21, almost 10 times bigger than the total density of the protease. The second remarkable feature of this subgraph is that it contains one of the two catalytic amino acids of the M pro of SARS CoV-2, which is Cys-145. That is, the region with the largest increase in the LR subgraph centrality of the protease of SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1 is the one enclosing the catalytic binding site of amino acid Cys-145. It is also remarkable that this region of large increment in the LR subgraph centrality contains some amino acids which are located in the binding site of the M pro to \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors as well as other kind of inhibitors, as we will analyze further in this work. This is the case of the residue 144-147, other amino acids in this binding site like residues 162, 163 also display large increment in the LR subgraph centrality. The last remarkable observation is that the domain III displays small change in relation to the changes of domains I and II in this topological parameter. However, as we will see in the next paragraphs this domain (residues 198-303) which is formed by 5 helices and is involved in the dimerization of the M pro , also increases significantly the LR communicability in relation to SARS CoV-1. A better picture of the changes in the different regions of the M pro of SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1 can be obtained again by analyzing the differences between the communicabilities and LR-communicabilities averaged for the 4 structures of SARS CoV-1 and 3 structures of SARS CoV-2 before considered. For this we obtain an average communicability (resp. LR communicability) matrix for the structures of SARS CoV-1 and another for the structures of SARS CoV-2. Then, we obtain the difference between these two matrices. In Fig.  5 we illustrate the difference matrices for both kinds of communicabilities. In the first case it can be observed that the communicability between all pairs of residues in the domain I (residues 10-99) mainly increase in SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1, with an increase of 12.8% relative to SARS CoV-1. However, in the domain II (residues 100-182) there is mainly a drop of the communicability between the residues in the domain, which decrease 2.02%, but there is an increase of 19.6% in the trade off between domains I and II, and an increase of 39.2% in the trade between domains I and III. The domain III shows a mixed behavior with some pairs of residues increasing and other decreasing their communicability, but the main result is an increase of 5.58% relative to SARS CoV-1. The communicability between domains II and III in the SARS CoV-2 structures increase in 23.9% relative to the same in SARS CoV-1.",

For instance, the average communicability between pairs of nodes in the domain I is 1997% higher in SARS CoV-2 than in SARS CoV-1. This percentage of increment are 1814% in the domain II and 2651% in domain III. The inter-domain communicability also increases very significantly with increment of 1896% (domains I-II), 2350% (domains (I-III) and 2237% (domains II-III). In closing, the structural changes between the main proteases of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 produced a dramatic impact in the LR communicability between residues in the protease of SARS CoV-2 with huge improvement in long-range communication between residues practically in all domains of the protease.",

However, here again, the most dramatic change in these topological properties occurs in the values of the LR subgraph centrality and communicability, with relative changes of more than 98%. We should notice that the smallest change in these parameters occurs for the structure 6M0K, which corresponds to the strongest inhibitor, followed by 6LZE, which is the intermediate one, and finally 6Y2G which is the weakest of the three. That is, the strongest inhibitor produces the smallest changes in the (LR) subgraph centrality and (LR) communicability in relation to the wild protease. In contrast, the weakest inhibitor changes the most these communicability parameters relative to the unbounded protease.

We find here that the difference between most of the topological properties of the PRNs representing both proteases differ in less than 5%. If we exclude from the analysis the LR measures, then 70% of the topological measures shows only a small variation between the two proteases taking as the average of the properties of several structures representing each of the two proteases. In this situation it is certainly remarkable that there are topological measures which change in more than 1000% from one protease to the other. These are the cases of the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids and of the LR communicability between pairs of them. The increase of these parameters in more than 1900% for SARS CoV-2 M pro relative to SARS CoV-1 M pro means that the structural changes that differentiate both proteases have created a huge increment in the efficiency of SARS CoV-2 M pro in transmitting perturbations of any kind between the amino acids of the protein using all available routes of connection and allowing for long-distance transmission.",

            "text": "To make clearer what this sensitivity means we are going to use a simple example. Let us consider a tiny perturbation on the structure of the proteases which prevent the interaction between the amino acids P9 and G11, which have been selected at random. In SARS CoV-1 M pro (taking 2BX4 as an example) these amino acids are at 5.69 \u00c5 and in SARS CoV-2 M pro (taking 6Y2E as an example) they are 6.48 \u00c5 apart. Thus, in both cases they are connected in the corresponding PRN. Let us consider that the perturbation remove this edge from the PRN of both proteases. The relative decrement of the average path length in SARS CoV-2 M pro relative to SARS CoV-1 M pro is almost imperceptible, i.e., 5.7%. In the case of the subgraph centrality it is of the same order, i.e., 3.4%. This means that according to these parameters SARS CoV-2 M pro is as sensitive as SARS CoV-1 M pro to perceive a structural change in its structure produced by a given perturbation. However, when we consider the LR subgraph centrality this relative change is 316.8%. That is, according to this topological parameter which takes into account long-range interactions, SARS CoV-2 M pro is more than three times more sensitive to a tiny structural change than SARS CoV-1 M pro . This remarkable finding indicates that the 12 mutations produced in SARS CoV-1 M pro makes the resulting SARS CoV-2 M pro much more efficient in transmitting \"information\" through the protein skeleton using short and long-range routes.is proportional to the absolute value of this difference. The second remarkable finding of the current work is that the largest changes in the LR subgraph centrality occurring in SARS CoV-2 M pro relative to SARS CoV-1 M pro do not spread equally across the whole structure of the protease. Instead, they are concentrated around a geometrical region which includes most of the amino acids involved in the binding site of the protease to inhibitors or close to it. One of the amino acids which has increased more dramatically its sensitivity to long-range transmission of information in SARS CoV-2 M pro is Cys-145, which is one of the two catalytic sites of the protease, and the one involved in interactions with the inhibitors, such as the ones analyzed here. We have analyzed here three different inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 M pro displaying very potent inhibitory capacity over the protease. In the three cases we have observed a significant variation in the LR subgraph centrality of the amino acids which were previously observed to have increased their LR sensitivity in the free protease. Therefore, these amino acids corresponds to those involved in the binding of these three inhibitors, showing that their increased topological role in the SARS CoV-2 M pro also may play an important functional role in it.",

            "text": "The analysis of PRN is easier than the study of the whole protein structure. In this sense the PRN represents a simplified model of the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Typically, such simplification in the complexity of the representation of systems convey a loss in the structural information which is represented by the global system. In this case, however, we have shown that the use of a network representation of the proteins reveals some hidden patterns in their structure that were escaping to the analysis by using the global structure. To detect such important structural factors it is necessary to account for longrange interactions among the amino acids of the proteases, which are the ones revealing the their most important characteristics in terms of their sensitivity to tiny structural changes produced by local or global perturbations to the system. Such LR interactions revealed here the main differences between the proteases of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2, as well as the most important amino acids for the interaction with inhibitors, which may produce therapeutic candidates against COVID-19.",
