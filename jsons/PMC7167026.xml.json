            "text": "In late December 2019, some local health facilities reported cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes that were epidemiologically related to seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.\n5\n The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deployed a team on 31st December to work with the Hubei Provincial Health Commission to investigate the epidemiological and etiological underlyings of the disease. Following isolation of the virus from lower respiratory tract samples by a number of Chinese scientists, deep genome sequencing analysis revealed the virus as a new betacoronavirus.\n13\n The virus was then named by WHO as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). According to a recent publication by Chan et al,\n14\n the disease has shown person\u2010to\u2010person or nosocomial transmission features, implying that it can easily pass on from one person\u2010to\u2010another. One of the authors, Dr. Yuen Kwok\u2010Yung, describes the disease as \u201casymptomatic walking pneumonia\u201d due to its ability to be transmitted even within the 3 to 14 days incubation period.\n15\n Another coauthor of a different article, Prof. Cao Bin, suggested that the Wuhan seafood market might not be the only source of the novel coronavirus. His reasoning followed from the fact that 14 of the first 41 hospitalized patients had no contacts with the Wuhan seafood market, signifying that there is the probability of other origins of the virus.\n10\n Despite this suggestion, the virus is now widely called the \u201cWuhan virus.\u201d",

Seven of the cases were classified as severe, and one person was reported dead on the 11th of January.\n16\n About 3 weeks later, on the 1st of February, 2020, updates on the spread of the disease indicate that over 11 900 people have been infected worldwide. Figure 1 shows how many people have been confirmed to be infected by the 2019\u2010nCoV disease in different nations including mainland China (11 793 cases) and its special administrative regions Hong Kong (13 cases), Macao (7 cases), and Taiwan (10 cases).\n1\n The same Figure provides information on how many suspected cases are still pending in mainland China, the death toll, and how many patients have been cured and discharged so far. Looking at the exponential increase in infections, as confirmed by a recent publication in the Journal of Medical Virology,\n17\n experts believe that the actual number of cases is far beyond the reported figures. Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, is of the view that the total number of infections globally could reach 100 000 by now.\n18\n Another publication in the Lancet Medical Journal by researchers from Hong Kong estimates there could be 75 815 people in Wuhan who were infected with the novel coronavirus as of 25th January.\n19\n\n",

At the same meeting, he also declared his approval of the Chinese government's measures to control the epidemic. That notwithstanding, some countries have already evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the central point of the outbreak. Among them are South Korea, Australia, Japan, USA, and a number of EU countries. Many more nations, such as New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt are equally arranging flights to evacuate their nationals. All of these nations have plans of quarantining the evacuees for a minimum of 14 days, which is believed to be the longest incubation period of the 2019\u2010nCoV. This would allow health specialists to monitor their health carefully, treat any ailments that might show up within the 14 days, and also limit the human\u2010to\u2010human spread of infections in the various nations.\n26\n\n",

Finally, individuals are advised to wear masks and cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing in public.\n30\n With all these measures in place, the transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV is expected to reduce drastically while scientists still race to find a permanent cure for this deadly disease.",
