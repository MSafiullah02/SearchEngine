Due to the urgent nature of these recommendations we included non peer-reviewed sources sent to the authors via social media and email from our colleagues in the above listed specialties. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization guidance provided a framework for discussion.

Using the CDC COVID-19 Case Report Form as a guide,10 acute stroke patients should be assessed for a history of subjective fever, chills, myalgias, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, or diarrhea within the past 7 days. Finally, patients should be asked for any exposure to anyone with known or suspected COVID-19 disease in the past 14 days. This screening process is outlined in Figure 1. One of the major challenges of patients with stroke, compared with other patients presenting to the ED, is that they may not be able to communicate due to aphasia or changes in the level of consciousness. Patients who cannot provide screening information should be assumed to potentially have COVID-19 and managed accordingly.",

Although providers may be tempted to include a CT of the chest along with acute stroke imaging, the American College of Radiology does not currently recommend using chest CT as a screening tool or first line test for suspected COVID-19. The chest imaging findings are nonspecific and overlap with other infections such as influenza.11 It is also important to note that depending on the air exchange rate in the CT scanner room, the scanner may be temporarily unavailable for subsequent patients after imaging a patient under investigation or COVID positive patient. Radiology departments must have protocols and procedures in place for expedited decontamination based on CDC guidelines,12 or even (as in our ED) a dedicated scanner for persons under investigation (PUIs) and COVID positive patients.",

For this reason, we recommend that patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who require intubation undergo elective endotracheal intubation in a negative airflow room by an experienced airway specialist using local institutional precautions and backed by CDC Guidelines for infection control12 before arrival to the IR suite. Unless the need for a secure airway is emergent, intubation should occur after a patient receives acute stroke imaging and is deemed to be a candidate for EVT to avoid unnecessary use of resources. While preprocedural intubation will delay door-to-groin time compared with conscious sedation, retrospective studies are conflicting as to whether this translates into worse functional outcomes.14,15 As the AHA recommends, \u201cit is reasonable to select an anesthetic technique during EVT for AIS on the basis of individualized assessment of patient risk factors, technical performance of the procedure, and other clinical characteristics.\u201d16 To mitigate potential worsening of stroke symptoms due to hypotension, we recommend using an intubation strategy that preserves cerebral perfusion pressure using either etomidate or ketamine,17 with near continuous monitoring of blood pressure. If hypotension does occur, we recommend early use of sympathomimetics and a fluid-conservative resuscitation strategy in accordance with Critical Care Medicine COVID-19 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.18 Preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation during intubation, avoidance of bag mask ventilation, rapid sequence intubation facilitated by neuromuscular blockade, and use of video laryngoscopy are also recommended to further limit exposure to secretions and optimize first pass success rate.",

Specifically, we recommend that patients who are admitted to the standard floor (medical/surgical) level of care with confirmed or suspected infection undergo a baseline neurological assessment in addition to their routine nursing and vital sign assessments. Treating physicians should be aware of the increased risk of neurological complications and monitor for these changes. To minimize the duration of nurse/patient encounters, we suggest the rapidly administered Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale which consists of asking a patient to (1) smile, assessing for facial drop; (2) hold both arms up for 10 seconds, assessing for weakness; and (3) repeat a simple phrase, assessing for language dysfunction. The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale has 81% sensitivity for stroke detection.21 A positive screen should trigger activation of a provider experienced in evaluating stroke patients and, if AIS is strongly suspected, a stat CT head and CT angiogram of the head and neck should be obtained concurrently. Given the risk to staff of transporting a COVID+ patient to the CT scanner, in-person or telemedicine screening by an experienced provider before imaging may be a net benefit despite any delay in care it may impose. Patients should wear a surgical mask at all times and staff in the IR suite should use PPE as described above to avoid exposure. After CT and CT angiogram are performed, IV thrombolytic therapy can be started as appropriate and EVT algorithm can be initiated as above for patients with large vessel occlusions. If a patient is deemed a candidate for EVT, we again recommend careful risk-assessment with respect to airway management by a member of the stroke/neurointerventional team and an experienced airway specialist, as outlined above and in Figure 2.",
