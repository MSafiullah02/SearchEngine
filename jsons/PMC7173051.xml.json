Colonisation and survival of an individual microbe in the human nasopharynx are determined by numerous factors, some of which are host-specific, such as environmental exposure to infectious agents and immune function, and some microbial, including interactions between microbial species. It is the extent and mechanisms by which microbes interact and the resulting potential to cause disease that are of particular interest. Several studies have suggested that viral infections of the URT predispose to bacterial respiratory infection and that viruses in the URT enhance bacterial adherence to respiratory tract cells [5], [6], [7], [8]. Pathogens can also alter the effects of co-infecting pathogens by destroying or damaging a physical barrier, decreasing mucociliary activity, altering immune cell function or up-regulating gene expression [9]. Data are limited on the co-occurrence of bacteria in the URT [10], [11], [12] and on associations between colonising pathogens in the absence of symptoms.",

The project design has been described elsewhere [13]. Briefly, 100 Aboriginal and 180 non-Aboriginal children were enrolled at birth and followed regularly to age 2 years. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected at ages 1\u20133, 6\u20138 and 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Primary bacterial isolation of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. aureus was performed using selective media [13], [20]. To identify viruses, nucleic acid extraction for nucleic acid amplification was carried out using QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (QiaGen corp) in accordance to the manufacturer's protocol. In-house nested or semi-nested PCR amplification was performed for rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses A and B, coronaviruses and parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133. However, only adenovirus and rhinovirus were detected in sufficient numbers to be included in this data analysis.",

The presence or absence of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, adenovirus and rhinovirus was recorded for every sample. A hierarchical logistic model was constructed with joint binary responses for each of the pathogens. This provided estimates of multivariate normally distributed random effects (under a logit link) at the host level and also residuals at the microbe level which have a multivariate Bernoulli distribution. Modelling of multivariate longitudinal data is frequently performed but in most cases the correlations between dependent variables are regarded as nuisance parameters which must be accounted for in order to estimate fixed effects accurately [21], [22]. However, in this study, they are the main focus of interest. One previous study has investigated separate levels of multivariate association in longitudinal binary data with a similar approach to that used here [23]. Estimated covariances of the random effects and their standard errors provide an indication of significance of the association between each pair of pathogens, at both the host and microbe levels. The models incorporated fixed effects to adjust for a quadratic dependence of log odds of carriage on age and also for seasonal effects. Patterns of co-occurrence were analysed separately in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The analysis was conducted using the MLwiN software package [24] with a penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) solution method. A detailed model description is presented in Appendix B.",

In Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children of all ages, S. pneumoniae was isolated more frequently when M. catarrhalis was also isolated than when M. catarrhalis was not isolated. A similar pattern was observed for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and also for S. pneumoniae and rhinovirus except in children aged <1 month. On cross-sectional examination, co-occurrence of S. pneumoniae with adenovirus and with S. aureus varied with age (Fig. 1(b and d)).",

Similarly, a positive covariance will always equate to an OR of greater than 1. However, there is no simple correspondence between non-zero covariances and ORs when the prevalence of carriage or infection changes over time and individuals have differing susceptibilities. Nevertheless, some indications can be provided: the most significant microbe-level covariances found in this study were in the region of 0.25 which would correspond to an OR of 2.8 if both pathogens were to have a constant prevalence of 50% in all individuals. This rises to an OR of 5.9 for less frequently occurring pathogens with a prevalence of 10%.",

Concurrent multiple bacterial infections may be more pathogenic than single infections. It has been suggested that the more persistent severe OM experienced by Aboriginal children compared with non-Aboriginal children may be related to simultaneous prolonged carriage of multiple OM pathogens in the nasopharynx of Aboriginal children [2]. Hence the host-level social and environmental factors giving a high force of infection must be addressed to reduce the concurrent carriage of pathogens in the URT and the resulting severe outcomes of OM in Aboriginal children. Environmental factors are also likely to contribute to the positive host-level association observed between rhinovirus and S. pneumoniae in Aboriginal children. At the host level, mucosal immune function may play an important role in preventing colonisation by potential pathogens [28], [29]. Salivary IgA to OM pathogens has been measured as part of the Kalgoorlie OM Research Project and we will investigate associations between immune status and URT carriage.",

Thus, \u03b2-lactamase-producing M. catarrhalis may act as an indirect pathogen. On the other hand, micro-organisms may compete for successful colonisation in the URT [31] and we found negative associations at the microbe level between S. aureus and both M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. We did not find significant negative associations between all serotypes of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. However, significant negative associations have been reported between S. aureus and the serotypes included in 7vPCV [11], [12], [14] and the potential for serotype and species replacement after immunisation with 7vPCV exists [32].
