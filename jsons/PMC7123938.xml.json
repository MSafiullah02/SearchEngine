It offers an alternative approach for producing important bioactive metabolites in the face of different adverse circumstances such as circumstances loss of plant populations, genetic diversity, habitat degradation and, even, species extinction, etc. It has emerged as a viable biotechnological tool for the production of bioactive compounds that can be used in the most diversified areas and particularly with a view of an additional effort for sustainable conservation and rational utilization of biodiversity. Plant tissue culture technology could be a potential alternative approach for production of high-value bioactive phytoconstituents of therapeutic importance and might be attractive under certain conditions such as: when (i) the source plant is difficult to cultivate, (ii) has a long cultivation period, (iii) has a low metabolite yield, (iv) chemical synthesis has not been achieved due to technical problem, etc. In addition, (v) novel compounds which are not generally found in the parent plants can be produced in the in vitro grown plants through plant tissue culture as well as (vi) stereo- and region-specific biotransformation of the plant cells can be performed for the production of bioactive compoundS from economical precursors.",

These and a number of other advantages in using plant cell culture provide impetus for its use for large-scale production of important bioactive compounds at industrial level. These advantages are summarized as follows:(i)Plant cell cultures are independent from environmental factors;(ii)Production levels may be geared more accurately according to the market demand;(iii)By using characterized cell lines, a more consistent product quality and yield can be maintained;(iv)New routes of synthesis can be recovered from mutant cell lines which may lead to the development of novel products;(v)Culture of cells will reduce the pressure on already overexploited medicinal and other economically important plants.(vi)The advantage of this method is that it can ultimately provide a continuous, reliable source\n of natural products;(vii)The advantage of the cell cultures include synthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites, running in controlled environment, independently from climate and soil conditions;(viii)The use of in vitro plant cell culture for the production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals has made great strides building on advances in plant science;(ix)The increased use of genetic tools and an emerging picture of the structure and regulation of pathways for secondary metabolism will provide the basis for the production of commercially acceptable levels of product;(x)The increased level of natural products for medicinal purposes coupled with the low product yields and supply concerns of plant harvest has renewed interest in large-scale plant cell culture technology;(xi)Knowledge of biosynthetic pathways of desired phytochemicals in plants as well as in cultures is often still in its infancy, and consequently strategies needed to develop an information based on a cellular and molecular level. These results show that in vitro plant cell cultures have potential for commercial production of secondary metabolites; and(xii)The introduction of newer techniques of molecular biology, so as to produce transgenic cultures and to effect the expression and regulation of biosynthetic pathways, is also likely to be a significant step toward making cell cultures more generally applicable to the commercial production of secondary metabolites.\n",

            "text": "\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) should not be confused with diabetes insipidus (DI). Diabetes insipidus occurs when a person\u2019s kidneys pass an abnormally large volume of urine that is insipid (dilute and odorless). In most people, the kidneys pass about 1\u20132 quarts of urine a day, but in person with DI, the kidneys can pass 3\u201320 quarts of urine a day. As a result, a person with DI may feel the need to drink large amounts of liquids. DM results from insulin deficiency or resistance leading to high blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus are unrelated, although both conditions cause frequent urination and constant thirst. Diabetes mellitus causes high blood glucose, or blood sugar, resulting from the body\u2019s inability to use blood glucose for energy. People with diabetes insipidus have normal blood glucose levels; however, their kidneys cannot balance fluid in the body. Excessive urination and extreme thirst as a result of inadequate output of the pituitary hormone ADH ( antidiuretic hormone\u2013\u2013 vasopressin) (Fig. 7.1) or the lack of the normal response by the kidney to ADH. There are four types of diabetes insipidus; (i) central diabetes insipidus, (ii) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, (iii) dipsogenic diabetes insipidus, and (iv) gestational diabetes insipidus. The most common symptom of DI is frequent urination and it is is a rare disorder, i.e., a rare disease that causes frequent urination.\n",

After having this drink, you need to stay at rest until a further blood sample is taken after 2 h.HbA1c test for\ndiagnosis: An HbA1c test does not directly measure the level of blood glucose, however, the result of the test is influenced by how high or low your blood glucose levels have tended to be over a period of 2\u20133 months.\n",

Herbal medications have long been used in the treatment and prevention of T2DM in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda, Unani). Existing therapeutic drugs used for diabetes increase various secondary complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, liver injury, dizziness, mental disorders, weight gain, and skin diseases. Nowadays, the key therapeutic agents to treat T2DM and its complications, sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin-sensitizing glitazones all improve metabolic control and lead to control of various circulating inflammation mediators through innate immunity-related signaling pathways. Sulfonylureas and metformin are main drugs to prevent the T2DM, and sulfonylureas increase insulin production from pancreatic \u03b2-cells, while metformin suppresses glucose production in the liver and meanwhile increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Glitazones, another antidiabetic drug, binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), beginning a transcriptional activity that leads to improved insulin action through reducing the secretion of inflammatory markers. Consequently, glitazones reduced levels of CRP, PAI-1, TNF-\u03b1, and other inflammatory markers. These drugs showed better antidiabetic nature and also have the comparable anti-inflammatory potential.",

            "text": "\nHypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure (BP) is a chronic medical condition in which the BP in the arteries is elevated. BP is a combination of systolic and diastolic pressure. According to WHO criteria, hypertension means elevated blood pressure levels above 140/90 mmHg (Lifton 1996). Systolic pressure represents blood force, or pressure, while the heart is beating and diastolic pressure stands for blood pressure when the heart is at rest. Systolic pressure is always the first or top measurement in a blood pressure reading. In a reading of 130/80, 130 represents systolic pressure and 80 represents diastolic pressure. In prehypertension, systolic numbers range from 120 to 129 and diastolic numbers are less than 80. HTN has been named the \u201csilent killer\u201d as it is asymptomatic and the major contributor or risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Gavras 2009). In 2000, 26.4% of the world\u2019s population suffered hypertension and it is predicted that this rate would increase by 60% in 2025 (Kearney et al. 2005).",

High blood pressure happens when the pressure on the arteries and blood vessels becomes too high and the arterial wall becomes distorted causing extra stress on the heart. Long-term high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and diabetes. Results of high blood pressure include arterial damage, aneurysm, heart failure, blocked or ruptured blood vessels, reduced kidney function, vision loss, loss of cognitive function (concentration, memory, and ability to learn), metabolic syndrome (high cholesterol and insulin, atherosclerosis and increased waist size), etc. Frequently, there are no symptoms as blood pressure increases, but warning signs for very high BP include usually chest pains, confusion, headaches, ear noise or buzzing, irregular heartbeat, nosebleeds, tiredness or vision changes, etc. High-salt diet, emotional stress, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, obesity, inactivity, birth control pills, heavy-metal poisoning, etc., are the probable causes of high blood pressure. Patients with BP higher than 130/80 mmHg with concomitant presence of diabetes or kidney disease require further treatment. Exercise HTN is an excessively high elevation (systolic values between 200 and 230 mmHg) in BP during exercise. Exercise HTN may indicate that an individual is at risk for developing HTN at rest. Persistent HTN is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, and arterial aneurysm, and is a leading cause of chronic kidney failure. Moderate elevation of arterial BP leads to shortened life expectancy (Table 7.10). Different causes of hypertension are described in Table 7.8.\n",

Cancer chemoprevention with natural bioactive phytochemicals is an emerging strategy to prevent, impede, delay, or cure cancer.\nused as cancer chemopreventive\n\n(i)Apigenin is a flavone present in vegetables such as parsley, celery, chamomile, and Moringa peregrina. It demonstrates cytotoxic activities against breast cancer cell lines (MCF 7), colon cell line (HCT 116), and its cytotoxic activity is comparable to that of doxorubicin;(ii)Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the major components of popular spice turmeric, C. longa L., a member of the ginger family. Its anticancer effects have been studied for colon cancer, breast cancer, lung metastases, and brain tumor;(iii)Crocetin from, Crocus sativus L. Saffron is a food colorant present in the dry stigmas of the plant and it is a potential agent for a novel anticancer drug against hepatocellular carcinoma;(iv)Cyanidin is an extract of pigment from red berries such as grapes, blackberry, cranberry, raspberry, or apples and plums, red cabbage, and red onion. It possesses antioxidant and radical-scavenging effects which may reduce the risk of cancer;(v)\nIndole-3-carbinol (I3C) is found in brassica vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens. Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a digestion derivative of indole-3-carbinol via condensation formed in the acidic environment of the stomach. Both are studied for their anticarcinogenic effects;(vi)\nEpigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant catechin compounds in green tea. EGCG can be beneficial in treating brain, prostate, cervical, and bladder cancers.(vii)Fisetin is a flavone found in various plants such as Acacia greggii, Acacia berlandieri, Eurasian smoketree, parrot tree, strawberries, apple, persimmon, grape, onion, and cucumber Fisetin alleviates aging effects in the yeast or fruit fly, exerts anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation and anticarcinogenic effects in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells;(viii)Genistein is an isoflavone originates from a number of plants such as lupine, fava beans, soybeans, kudzu, and psoralea, and coffee. Functioning as antioxidant and anthelmintic, genistein has been found to have antiangiogenic effects (blocking formation of new blood vessels), and may block the uncontrolled cell growth associated with cancer, most likely by inhibiting the enzymes that regulate cell division and cell survival (growth factors).(ix)Gingerol is the active component of fresh ginger with distinctive spicyness. Gingerol has been studied for its anticancerous effects for the tumors in colon, breast and ovarian and pancreas;(x)Kaempferol is a natural flavonol isolated from tea, broccoli, witch-hazel, grapefruit, brussels sprouts, apples, etc., and has been studied for pancreatic cancer and lung cancer;(xi)\nLycopene is a bright red pigment and phytochemical from tomatoes, red carrots, watermelons, and red papayas. It demonstrates antioxidant activity and chemopreventive effects in many studies, especially for prostate cancer;(xii)Phenyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), along with sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, such as watercress, broccoli, cabbage, etc., have been studied for induction of apoptosis in cell lines. PEITC has shown very strong potency against melanoma. It has been intensively studied for chemoprevention against breast cancer cells, non-small-cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, osteogenic sarcoma U-2 OS, prostate cancer, and myeloma cell lines;(xiii)\nResveratrol is a natural phenol and can be found in the red grapes skin, peanuts, and in other fruits. It is cancer chemopreventive;(xiv)Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural antioxidant found in culinary spice and medicinal herbs such as lemon balm, peppermint, sage, thyme, oregano, and rosemary to treat numerous ailments. Rosemary extracts play important roles in anti-inflammation, antitumor, and antiproliferation in various in vitro and in vivo studies;(xv)\nSulforaphane is an organosulfur compound obtained from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbages. The enzyme myrosinase in GI tract transforms glucoraphanin into sulforaphane upon damage to the plant such as from chewing.(xvi)Triterpenoids are biosynthesized in plants by cyclization of squalene, a triterpene hydrocarbon and precursor of all steroids.

Various in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted for chemoprevention and therapy of breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer using triterpenoids.(xvii)Light-exposed mushroom could be an excellent source of Vitamin D. Vitamin D has been involved in breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer;(xviii)Vitamin E includes both tocopherols and tocotrienols, a fat-soluble antioxidant, and exists in many foods including wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oils. Alphatocopherol is the most bioactive form of vitamin E that stops the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when fat undergoes oxidation. There are reports that both tocopherols and tocotrienols have antitumor effects due to their antioxidant properties, and tocotrienols show stronger bioactivity and both show antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and COX-2 inhibiting effects in in vitro studies.\n",

Despite the progress made in immunization and drug development, many viruses lack preventive vaccines and efficient antiviral therapies, which are often beset by the generation of viral escape mutants. Viral diseases pose a great risk to human health as viral infections are tough to control due to mutative nature of the viral genomes. Medicinal plants provide diverse bioactive phytochemicals which play synergetic role in maintaining human health and there is the constant emergence of new resistant viral strains which demands novel antiviral agents with fewer side effects and cell toxicity (Kapoor et al. 2017).

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology\u2014biopharmaceutics. Examples of high-tech herbal medicine are plant-based vaccines, use of potato tubers as a biofactory for recombinant antibodies, etc.",

Plant-based vaccine production mainly involves the integration of transgene into the plant cells. Herbal or plant-based vaccine technologies involve the integration of the desired genes encoding the antigen protein for specific disease into the genome of plant tissues. The plants then start producing the exact protein that will be used for vaccinations. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer and transformation via genetically modified plant virus are the common methods that have been used to produce effective vaccines. New methods such as biolistic, electroporation, agroinfiltration, sonication, polyethylene glycol treatment, etc., have been developed to increase the efficiency of former methods. The flexibility of the plant expressed vaccine system, combined with its low cost and ability to massively scale may provide vaccine protection not only to citizens of the developed as well as developing countries of the world that cannot currently afford vaccines.

(ii) The gene encoding this protein is then identified and isolated. (iii) The gene is integrated into a suitable expression vector and introduced into a suitable host where it expresses the protein in large quantities. (iv) The protein is then isolated and purified from the host cells, and (v) It is used for the preparation of vaccine. The host organisms used for expression of immunogenic proteins to be used as vaccines may be any one of the following:\n(i)A genetically engineered microorganism, e.g., yeast for the expression of hepatitis 8 surface antigen (HBsAg) used as vaccine against hepatitis B virus (this vaccine is approved for marketing in India) (Table 7.15).\n(ii)Cultured animal cells, e.g., HBsAg expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary Chinese hamster ovary) cell line and C-127 cell line; the vaccine is in advanced stages of development.(iii)Transgenic plants, e.g., HBsAg, HIV-1 ( human immunodeficiency virus I) epitope. Rhinovirus 14 epitope (the last two for use as vaccines against HIV-1; in experimental stages).(iv)\nInsect larvae; the gene is integrated into a baculovirus (DNA viruses) which is used to infect insect larvae. Often, a very high quantity of the recombinant protein is produced. For example, up to 68% of the total protein of Spodoptera exigua larvae infected with a recombinant baculovirus is the recombinant protein. This protein can be purified for use as vaccine or may be used in diagnostic tests without purification. This approach has also been used to produce monoclonal antibodies to uncommon antigens. e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s protein.So far a large number of recombinant immunogenic proteins of pathogens have been produced and evaluated. In general, a majority of such proteins are ineffective or only poorly effective in immunization. In some cases, at least, this problem may be due to the essential requirement for the immunogenic protein to be present in a specific aggregate form, e.g., HBsAg can be used for effective immunization only when it forms virus-like particles (of about 22 nm). Thus far hepatitis B vaccine is the only good example of a recombinant protein vaccine. An antimalarial vaccine based on the recombinant circumsporozoite protein of the sporozoite stage of the parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) is in advanced stages of development.",

It also binds to biotinylated DNA molecules due to its streptavidin moiety.

This necessitates a much larger dose of expensive drugs, and may often produce severe undesirable effects in other organs/tissues. Further, oral route of drug administration is much more desirable than that by injection for obvious reasons. But this route is unsuitable for the new class of protein/peptide drugs due to poor uptake; this is because of proteolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and poor permeability of the intestinal mucosa to these high molecular weight therapeutic agents. The following approaches are being developed for a more efficient and/or targetted delivery of drugs:(i)Peptide/protein drugs may be delivered by oilier routes, e.g., nasal, buccal, rectal, ocular, pulmonary, and vaginal routes; of these the nasal route appears to be the most promising.

Therefore, new and better enhancers are being developed.(ii)A variety of drugs can be encapsulated in liposomes, which are small lipid vesicles produced artificially. But liposomes have the disadvantages of larger size and poor tissue or cell type selectivity (liposomes become concentrated in liver and spleen). Tissue selectivity of liposomes can be greyly increased by attaching to their surface specific ligands, e.g., monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). When polyethylene glycolis also attached to the surface of such liposomes (having Mabs on their surface), the circulation time as well as the site-specific delivery of liposomes is greatly increased; such liposomes are called \u201cstealth liposomes\u201d. Liposomes hold great promise as a DNA delivery system in gene therapy, but they have to be injected into the subjects.(iii)Polymers have been used as drug delivery systems; the drug is generally released by cleavage of the drug from the polymer, swelling of the polymer (for drugs trapped within the polymeric chains), through osmotic pressure generated pores, or simple diffusion. Polyesters are the widely studied biodegradable products; their hydrolysis yields nontoxic alcohols and organic acids. Polyesters of lactic acid and glycolic acid are the most widely used polyesters for slow release of drugs having large molecules, e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, and oligonucleotides. The drugs being delivered by the polymer systems include insulin growth factors, steroids, anticancer drugs, etc.(iv)The most effective system for site-directed delivery of drugs and other moieties (called drug targeting) is based on monoclonal antibodies. Immunotoxins serve as a good example of this approach. The application of this technology is limited by the low availability of Mabs specific to a given tumor cell type and also by the changing surface decorations (antigens displayed on the cell surface) of tumor cells. Intensive research efforts are directed in this very important area of disease treatment, and many important developments may be expected in the near future.\n",

The first approach was used in the first two patients on whom gene therapy was attempted to correct the genetic disorder called Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome produced by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. (i) Normal/IDA gene copies were produced by cloning and then (ii) packed into a defective retrovirus; most of the viral genes were replaced by the ADA gene, (iii) Lymphocytes were isolated from the patients, and (iv) the recombinant retroviruses were used to infect the lymphocytes. Finally, (v) the infected cells expressing the A/14 gene were injected back into the patients.

Hence, the sequence to be introduced is located in the inner region of the vector and is flanked by the sequences involved in recombination. A recombination of such a vector with its homologous cellular sequences produces a duplication of the targetted sequence; this is called insertional recombination. In contrast, a linearized replacement vector has the two halves of the target gene at its two ends. Recombination occurs within the two halves of the target gene, replacing a portion of the endogenous gene sequence by that of the introduced gene: this is called replacement recombination.
