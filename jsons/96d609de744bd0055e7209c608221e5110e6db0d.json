Viral and/or bacterial infection was detected in 78% of COPD exacerbations (29.7% bacterial, 23.3% viral, 25% viral/bacterial co-infection). Infectious exacerbations had longer hospitalizations and greater impairment of several measures of lung function than non-infectious exacerbations. Importantly, exacerbations with co-infection had more marked lung function impairment and longer hospitalizations. Similarly, when COPD exacerbations not requiring hospitalization were evaluated, a greater lung function fall was documented in those patients where both bacterial infection and cold symptoms were present simultaneously (Wilkinson et al 2006) . This data suggests that bacterial and viral infections could synergistically cooperate to increase severity of the exacerbations.

Antibiotic therapy is already widely used, but not always appropriately, in the treatment of COPD exacerbations (GOLD 2006) . Indeed, a recent meta-analysis supports antibiotics only for those patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill. Analysis restricted to community-based studies did not fi nd any differences between antibiotic and placebo (Ram et al 2006) . In asthma, recent study showed a signifi cation reduction of symptoms at exacerbations in those patients receiving telithromycin as compared to placebo. Given that no relationship between bacteriologic status and the response to study treatment was found, the mechanisms of such a benefi t remain unclear (Johnston et al 2006) . Therefore, (i) there is an urgent need to develop simple clinical or biological markers to identify those patients at highest risk of bacterial infection and who will benefi t most from antibiotic therapy, (ii) further studies are needed to evaluate whether novel class of antibiotics can be more effective in the treatment of COPD exacerbations. Antiviral therapy, and in particular anti-rhinovirus therapy, is a \"still theoretically\" relevant therapeutic option since two thirds of exacerbations are associated with viral infections (Seemungal 2001) . Indeed, so far no study has investigated whether currently available antiviral treatment can reduce viral induced COPD exacerbations. The use of anti-infl uenza neuraminidase inhibitors in COPD exacerbations during infl uenza epidemic appears appropriate in non vaccinated patients and may reduce the number of hospitalizations (Lalezari et al 2001; Cooper et al 2003; Kaiser et al 2003) , though further controlled clinical trials are needed to confi rm therapeutic benefi t.",

A recent study documented that patients with frequent COPD exacerbation have more frequent episodes of naturally occurring colds as compared to patients with infrequent exacerbations (Hurst et al 2005) . These results suggest that COPD subjects with frequent exacerbations may represent a subgroup particularly susceptible to viral infections. Thus, while there is solid evidence of impaired innate (Wark et al 2005; Contoli et al 2006) and possibly acquired (Gern et al 2000; Papadopoulos et al 2002) immune responses to viral infection in asthmatic patients, it is not yet clear whether COPD patients have increased susceptibility to viral infections. Intriguingly patients experiencing frequent colds had a signifi cantly higher exposure to cigarette smoke (Hurst 2005) . Recently, using a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure, it has been demonstrated that cigarette smoke increases susceptibility to viral infections possibly via alteration/inhibition of immune response (Robbins et al 2004) .",

One way to overcome these obstacles is the development of a human experimental model that would allow studies to take place under controlled conditions.

In COPD this is so far the only model where a specifi c etiology has been experimentally proven to induce exacerbation. In this pilot study mild to moderate COPD patients were safely experimentally infected with rhinovirus providing for the fi st time that, in in vivo experimental condition, rhinovirus infection in COPD patients is per se suffi cient to trigger exacerbations. Lower respiratory tract symptom scores were signifi cantly increased compared to baseline on days 7 to 14, with peak lower respiratory tract symptoms on days 10 and 11. When the individual symptoms were analyzed separately, all fi ve lower respiratory symptom domains (wheeze, cough, sputum production and dyspnea) increased from baseline however the increases were only statistically signifi cant for wheeze, cough and sputum production, but not for dyspnea. In terms of recovery, all symptom domains other than sputum production had recovered to baseline by day 20, however full recovery of sputum production took almost 4 weeks (Mallia et al 2006) . This important data suggests that the link between virus-induced COPD exacerbation and increased dyspnea and sputum production is probably very complex and needs dedicated studies for a better comprehension.",

This fi nding is in line with previous studies showing that in vivo experimental rhinovirus infection in normal subjects leads to lower airway eosinophilia (Fraenkel et al 1995) . Thus, enhanced airway eosinophilic infl ammation of the airway may be a hallmark of viral infection. Further studies are required to confi rm and extend this pivotal observation and to evaluate whether modulation of rhinovirus-induced activation of pro-infl ammatory mediators (ie, NF-\u03baB) might be of any relevance in the treatment/prevention of virus-induced COPD exacerbations.",

            "text": "Many studies conducted in the last decade have produced convincing data on the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of natural and experimental respiratory virus infections in humans, particularly rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Most of the studies have been performed on human respiratory epithelial cells, which can be directly infected by RV and RSV. Their infection by RV and RSV determines the production of several pro-infl ammatory molecules (such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules). Conversely, very few studies have been conducted in vivo on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-infl ammatory derangement induced by respiratory viruses in the airways during COPD exacerbations. Collectively these studies suggest a critical role for several transcription factor families, including the NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and GATA families, in the production of pro-infl ammatory mediators after RV and RSV infection. The relative importance of each cell, mediator, signalling pathway and transcription factor will hopefully be clarifi ed in the next few years. The recent development of the fi rst human model of virus induced COPD exacerbation, that has been demonstrated to be feasible and so far, safe, will facilitate identifi cation of novel pharmacological targets that will provide opportunities to develop new treatments for exacerbations of COPD.",
