Traditionally, HCT-related pulmonary disease is considered in the context of the time frame after HCT. Complications that occur within the fi rst 100 days are often categorized as early-onset; after the fi rst 100 days is considered to be late-onset [ 2 ] . Early-onset complications tend to be acute in presentation and are directly related to lung injury from the transplantation procedure or infections associated with immune reconstitution status. Most episodes of acute respiratory failure occur in the early period, but acute respiratory failure can occur any time after HCT. After day 100, noninfectious pulmonary disease predominates in the spectrum of HCT-related complications as manifestations of late-onset lung injury or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Some patients experience acute respiratory failure as a consequence of these entities or from acute infections due to continued immunosuppression.
