Here we report that virion incorporation of PSGL-1 on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions blocks S protein-mediated virus attachment and infection of target cells.

Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines. Understanding virus-host interactions is critical for developing novel therapeutics and vaccines. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, also known as SELPLG or CD162) is a human protein recently identified to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity 1 . PSGL-1 binds to the selectin family of proteins, P-, E-, and L-selectin [2] [3] [4] , and mediates immune cell tethering and rolling on the surface of endothelium to promote cell migration into inflamed tissues [5] [6] [7] [8] . In the context of viral infection, PSGL-1 has been identified as an IFN-\u03b3-regulated inhibitory factor involved in blocking HIV-1 infectivity 7, 9 , and was recently found to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity 1 , blocking viral infections through steric hindrance of particle attachment to target cells 1, 10 .",

The S protein is also the target of neutralizing antibodies generated by the infected host. Because of its central role in virus infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein is a prime target for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. In addition to the adaptive arm of the host immune response, viral infections trigger an innate immune response, largely induced by IFN, that sets up an antiviral state. Hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced by viral infection [12] [13] [14] . While the role of some ISGs in blocking the replication of particular viruses has been well established, the vast majority of ISGs have not been characterized. Because of the significance of host innate immunity in viral transmission and replication within and between hosts, there is an unmet need to understand these antiviral inhibitory factors in detail.",

To investigate the ability of PSGL-1 to restrict coronavirus infection, we first established a lentiviral vector-based coronavirus pseudovirus infection system 15 , in which the S proteins from either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were used to pseudotype lentiviral particles ( Fig. 1a and 1d ). Using this system, we assembled particles in the presence or absence of PSGL-1 1 , and then used the particles to infect target Vero cells, which endogenously express the primary receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 16, 17 , for SARS-CoVs. For the production of SARS-CoV pseudoviruses, we found that expression of PSGL-1 in viral producer cells had a minor effect on virion release (Fig. 1b) , consistent with the previous finding that PSGL-1 expression has minimal effects on viral release 1 . However, the infection of Vero cells by PSGL-1-imprinted particles was completely abrogated (Fig. 1c) , demonstrating the abilities of PSGL-1 to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV S-bearing virions.",

As shown in Fig. 1e , PSGL-1 expression in viral producer cells had only a minor effect on virion release. In our initial infection assays in Vero cells, we found that particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein had much lower infectivity than those pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein. To resolve this technical issue, we developed a more sensitive reporter system, in which a luciferase reporter (Luc) gene was expression from the HIV-1 LTR in the presence of co-expressed HIV-1 Tat protein 18 (Fig. 1d) . A major advantage of this system is that high-level Luc expression can be achieved upon transactivation by coexpressed Tat protein following viral entry, which minimizes non-specific Luc background from non-productive viral entry 19 . Using this system, we found that the infectivity of the SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus is also potently inhibited by the expression of PSGL-1 in the virus-producer cells (Fig. 1f) . Together, these results suggest that the presence of PSGL-1 on virion particles can inhibit the binding of S proteins to their cellular receptors.",

PSGL-1 has been suggested to be expressed in certain lung cancer cells 20 . However, it remains to be determined whether PSGL-1 is expressed in the target cells of SARS coronaviruses in the lungs, and, if so, whether its expression can impact viral infection. It also remains unknown whether coronaviruses possess a mechanism for antagonizing PSGL-1. In HIV-1 infection, the viral accessory protein Vpu and Nef have been shown to antagonize PSGL-1 on CD4 T cells through surface downregulation and intracellular degradation 1 . Interestingly, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may also enter and infect human CD4 T cells, and express viral genes in T cells. Although a spreading viral infection was not observed in T cells 21 , infection of T cells by SARS-CoVs could potentially occur in the scenario of PSGL-1-mediated binding of T cells to inflamed human airway endothelium 22, 23 . Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether there is a role for PSGL-1 in blocking SARS-CoV-2 spreading infection in human cells that express PSGL-1.",

In addition, PSGL-1-inactivated coronaviruses or virus-like particles can largely maintain the native structure of viral surface proteins, but are blocked for binding to cell receptors. Such particles may stimulate immune responses different from chemically inactivated coronaviruses 24, 25 . It remains to be determined whether PSGL-1imprinted particles can minimize the product of suboptimal antibodies that are frequently associated with vaccine-mediated immunopathology 25 and antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection (ADE) 26 .",
