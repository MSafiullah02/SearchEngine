To illustrate its salience and possible applications, the paper calibrates and presents L-RaG values using country data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). Among other things, the author demonstrates that when properly benchmarked, the longevity-riskadjusted global age of a 55-year-old Swedish male is 48, whereas a 55-year-old Russian male is closer in age to 67. The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed L-RaG age and the related concept of Biological age, from the medical and gerontology literature. Practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the L-RaG age could be used for pension and retirement policy. In the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public's attention, educate them about lifetime uncertainty and induce many of them to take action -such as working longer and/or retiring later. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

In particular Gompertz remains quite popular in (i.) the valuation of annuities, (ii.) retirement income strategies and (iii.) stochastic mortality models. See for example: Angoshtari et al.

Despite its age and noted empirical limitations, his eponymous law of mortality -soon to celebrate its 200th anniversary -is still widely used in the fields of demographics, biology, actuarial science and even financial engineering. In particular, the ability to represent important actuarial expressions in closed form via the Gamma function has made the Gompertz representation especially convenient and popular in the annuity literature. The defining characteristic of the Gompertz law of mortality, when expressed in continuous time, is the linear relationship between the log of natural mortality rates and (chronological) age x. The natural law is written or expressed via the following parameterization: The compensation law of mortality in its strong form implies that (log) mortality rates increase linearly and then converge to a constant mortality plateau. This leads to a linear and negative relationship between the (initial natural mortality) intercept: ln h [i] , and the (mortality growth rate) slope: g [i] , in a Gompertz regression of log mortality rate on (chronological) age. The thick line in the center is based on the global average G, and used to map or convert (chronological) age into a longevity-risk-adjusted global age.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 67, "end": 82, "text": "Gompertz (1825)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 260, "end": 417, "text": "Leonid Gavrilov, Natalia Gavrilova, Maria Govorun, Huaxiong Huang, Mark Kamstra, Han Li, Andrea Nigri, Thomas Post, Stephen Richards, Stefan Ramonat, and Tom", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1323, "text": "Angoshtari et al.

Countries with a relatively low initial natural mortality rate tend to have a higher mortality growth rate and vice versa. The exact nature of this relationship -known as the compensation law of mortality -will be made precise later in the paper, but can be visualized conceptually in Fig. 1 .

This sort of information is used to predict health needs, as well as to generate more accurate forward-looking mortality rate projections and distributions of future lifetimes. Age adjustments, which are similar to actuarial setbacks, are a refined form of the underwriting process that has been used by life insurance companies for centuries. What has received less attention in the insurance literature, however, is how to map estimated mortality rates into a consistent longevity-risk-adjusted global age. To fill this gap in the literature, this paper develops a consistent framework for inverting the GM law of mortality for heterogeneous populations in a manner consistent with a compensation law. While the twostage process will be carefully explained, the end result is a simple equation which maps an individual's chronological age x, into a longevity-risk-adjusted global age (or L-RaG): \u03be , which may be higher or lower than x, depending on the relative shape of the country-specific q x [i] curve relative to the global curveq x .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A new age"}, {"text": "So, why bother doing this?

Now, this paper makes no claim about the efficacy of presenting longevity risk information in (what this author believes is) a more salient manner, and leaves that task to other (future) researchers.

In fact, recent work by Ye and Post (2020) indicates that economic behavior is highly correlated with how old people feel versus their chronological age. The pertinent question here is whether actuarial science can contribute yet another age metric, one that is consistent with heterogeneous mortality and known mathematical theories of aging. This paper argues that the answer is yes. This paper leverages the compensation law of mortality and the Gompertz-Makeham model to develop an expression for another measure of age, the longevity-risk-adjusted global age, denoted by L-RaG age. That is the main Eq. (21) and contribution in the paper. In its approximate form, Eq.

They measured the age-related disease burden by aggregating disability adjusted life years (DALY) across 195 countries & territories over the period 1990-2017.

The rest is algebra. 13 Now, one could just as easily use the same mortality rates to compare period life expectancy values between high-mortality and low-mortality countries and arrive at similarly large gaps between the two extremes. In fact, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regularly publishes reports comparing (more generally) quality of life across different countries and regions. However, one could argue that there are behavioral (a.k.a. psychological) reasons and benefits to anchoring on longevity-risk-adjusted global ages versus life expectancy, since -simply put -these numbers are more memorable.

Either way, both the (h, g) and (m, b) parameter estimates are displayed in Tables 1a and 1b, for all available countries in the Human Mortality Database. Now, in theory, one could stop (the estimation procedure) here and compute arithmetic or geometric (or some other harmonic) average global value for \u039b, H, G and then use those with the individual values of \u03bb[i], h[i], g[i] to compute longevity-riskadjusted global ages via Eq.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "11Recall that under the (m, b) formulation of the Gompertz-Makeham law, h = (1/b)e \u2212m/b and g = 1/b, when the total hazard rate is modeled as: \u00b5 x = he gx . So, a linear relationship between ln[h] = L \u2212 x * g, per the compensation law of mortality, also forces a relationship between m and b, although the relationship is obviously not linear. Fixing b, together with the global parameters (L, x * ), induces a value for m. Technically, after substitution and isolating:m = x * \u2212b(L+ln[b]). So, if one assumes the easy-to-remember values: x * = 100, and: L = \u22121, both of which are empirically reasonable perTable 2, then the modal value of the Gompertz distribution is forced to be: m = 100\u2212b(ln[b]\u22121). Thus, for example, in a country (or population) where b = 11 then m = 84.62, but if b = 9 then m = 89.2. A greater b induces a lower value of m and vice versa. Finally, since the expected remaining lifetime at birth under a Gompertz model is: E[T 0 ] = m \u2212 b\u03b3 , where \u03b3 \u2248 0.577, is Euler's constant, we obtain the rather intriguing expression E[T 0 ] = x * \u2212b(L+ln[b]+\u03b3 ) under the compensation law.

However, we can push this further by exploiting the relatively small (or near-zero) value of the constant within the logarithm: (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb[i])/(\u03bb * ), in Eq. (21).

The age set-back approach is common in actuarial practice to model sub-standard or healthy lives, but is technically inconsistent with the compensation law of mortality.Here is an example.Assume that in Mauritius (\u03bb[i] = \u039b, and) the value of h[i], which is the INMR, is: 15 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and the value of g[i] is 0.06; that is, a 6% MGR.

The process starts with vectors of country-specific decrements q x [i], obtained from period mortality tables. They are converted to continuous total hazard rates \u00b5 x [i] in a manner consistent with the Gompertz-Makeham law, since \u00b5 x \u0338 = q x . 2. Standard linear regression techniques are used to estimate the local Gompertz-Makeham parameters (\u03bb[i], h[i], g[i]) for each one of the i countries. 3. With the N parameters, a second phase regression is implemented to estimate the global (i.e., average) values of: \u039b, H, G, consistent with a compensation law. 4. Longevity-risk-adjusted global ages are computed using Eq. (4), using the country-specific: (\u03bb[i], h[i], g[i]), and particular values of \u039b, H, G. (In the end I will offer one further simplification that will reduce the number of required parameters, eliminating the H, but that will be explained in due time.) Before moving on to implement each one of the steps in detail, here is a brief recap of the mortality terminology. The model is formulated in continuous time, where the total hazard rate (THR) \u00b5 x [i], at chronological age x, in country i, is the sum of the accidental (Makeham death) rate \u03bb[i] and the natural age-dependent mortality (Gompertz) rate h[i]e g[i]x . The country-specific parameter h[i] is the initial (age zero) natural mortality rate, a.k.a. INMR, and g[i] is the country-specific mortality growth rate, MGR. To be very clear, despite the term initial, h[i] is not the infant mortality rate in country i. (The first 30 years of life do not obey the Gompertz law.)
