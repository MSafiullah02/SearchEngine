As a result, an increasing number of avian to human transmissions have occurred which is often with high mortality [1], [2]. Presently, HPAI H5N1 transmissions have been limited to avian to human, however, continuous adaptation of the H5N1 virus or reassortment with seasonal human influenza A strains may result in new H5N1 strains capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. As a result, these strains could cause an influenza pandemic with significant levels of morbidity and mortality.",

Currently, the microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are used to estimate neutralizing antibody responses against HPAI H5N1 viruses. The microneutralization (MN) assay confirmed by western blot analysis is considered to be the gold standard for detecting anti-H5N1 specific neutralizing antibody response in humans [3], however, the assay is somewhat labor-intensive and requires the use of various strains of replication competent H5N1 viruses under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment, which limits the common use of these tests in many affected countries. Because it evaluates cytopathic effect (CPE) to reach an end-point titer, the MN assay, requires significant training to perform with consistent accuracy. The HI assay is based on the measurement of the ability of antibody to inhibit the hemmaglutination of erythocytes by influenza viruses, and serves as a surrogate of neutralization of influenza virus. Unfortunately, the conventional HI assay that uses chicken erythrocytes as the indicator cells used for seasonal influenza strains has been found to be poorly suited for use with avian H5N1 infection [4]. Therefore, a modified HI assay using horse erythrocytes has been developed [5]. In addition, the HI assay does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus particles. Therefore, the development of a standardized, quantifiable assay to measure anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibody responses, which does not require BSL-3 containment is urgently needed for in serodiagnosis of human HPAI infections as well as for vaccine evaluation.",

These lentiviral pseudotypes have become useful tools in studies of viral entry and release, anti-viral drug screening, serodiagnosis, and for use in assessing the response to vaccines. Recently, the development of lentiviral pseudotypes expressing H5HA or H5HA and N1NA has been reported [14], [15]. These H5HA or H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes undergo a single-round of infection and cannot produce progeny viruses in the indicator cell lines. Thus, assays based on pseudotyped particles do not require BSL-3 facilities for production and testing. Pseudotype particles can also be engineered to contain reporter genes, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFP) and luciferase genes. Therefore, infectivity (transduction efficiency) of these pseudotypes can be readily assessed by measuring fluorescence that is indicative of the expression of the reporter gene.",

Thus, we used the flag-tagged N1NA in all subsequent experiments (for the sake of simplicity, in all the text we use NA to describe flag-tagged N1NA).",

Culture supernatants were collected and used to transduce the Maji-CCR5 target cells. Fig. 1f shows that treating 293 T cells with oseltamivir phosphate induced a marked dose-dependent decrease in the transduction efficiency of pseudotypes expressing H5HA and N1NA, but not pseudotypes expressing HIV-1 envelope or VSV-G. In contrast, treatment of Maji-CCR5 target cells with the same amount of oseltamivir phosphate did not reduce transduction efficiency of either the H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes or the HIV-1 envelope pseudotypes or VSV-G pseudotypes (Fig. 1g). Thus, these results indicate that enzymetic activity of NA is required for pseudotype release, but not pseudotype entry. Likely, the enzymetic activity of NA removes the sialic/neuraminic receptor from the surface of packaging cells and from virus particles to help pseudotype release. Taken together the results of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir study and the results of the bafilomycin A1 and NH4Cl studies strongly suggest that the mechanisms of cellular entry and release of pseudotypes expressing H5HA and N1NA are similar to those of wild type influenza A virus.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, immune sera elicited by priming and boosting with plasmid DNA expressing H5HA from H5N1 subclade 2.3 effectively neutralized pseudotypes expressing subclade 2.3 H5HA. The same sera weakly neutralized pseudotypes expressing clade 1 H5HA and did not neutralize H1HA/N1NA or VSV-G pseudotypes (Fig. 2c). Sera from mice immunized with pDNA encoding H5HA from subclade 2.3 followed by boosting with lentivirus-like particles (LVLP) expressing both H5HA from subclade 2.3 and N1NA showed similar results (Fig. 2a). Likewise, sera from mice primed and boosted with pDNA encoding H5HA from clade 1 most effectively neutralized pseudotypes expressing clade 1 H5HA. The same sera weakly neutralized subclade 2.3 H5HA and did not neutralize pseudotypes expressing H1HA/N1NA or VSV-G (Fig. 2d). Prime-boost studies using H5N1 clade 1 pDNA followed by H5N1 clade 1 LVLPs showed similar results (Fig. 2b).

Yang et al. [15] generated lentiviral pseudotypes co-expressing a clade 1 H5HA or a mutant form, as well as NA from H5N1 strains (A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 and A/Vietnam/1203/04). They then used the HA/NA pseudotypes to measure amino acid residual specificity of H5HA recognized by monoclonal antibodies generated from mice vaccinated with wild type or triple-mutant HA. However, the H5N1 influenza virus has evolved into 10 different genetic clades. Among these, clade 2 has been shown to be the most diverse and has been subdivided into five subclades. Presently, the circulating HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans fall into subclades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 7 [27]. The HA of H5N1 clades 1 and 2 are distinguishable antigenically [28]. Thus, pseudotypes expressing H5HA from a single clade may fail to detect neutralization activity in sera infected with H5N1 viruses from other clades or subclades. Pseudotypes expressing H5HA alone treated with exogenous HA [14] demonstrate suboptimal transduction efficiency, which limits the comparison of antibody titers measured by PN assay versus those measured by conventional MN and HI assays.",

We prepared a panel of these HA and NA pseudotypes that expressed different hemagglutinins from the major H5N1 clades and subclades that have been isolated from human infections. We also demonstrated that HA and NA pseudotypes mimic wild type of influenza virus in their mechanisms of cellular entry and release. Using immune mouse and ferret sera we developed a pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay and showed that this assay exhibited good specificity and that it can be used to measure quantitative differences in neutralization activity against different clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza viruses. We also demonstrated excellent correlation between neutralization titers measured by the MN and PN assays. Moreover, the PN assay was found to be somewhat more sensitive than the MN or HI assays, since it was able to detect low level specific antibody responses that were below the level of detection of the other assays. Finally, we used sera from ferrets immunized with adjuvanted and unadjuvanted split virion H5N1 vaccines to show the utility of the PN assay as a sensitive and quantifiable assay for measuring neutralizing antibody responses against diverse H5N1 clades and subclades. In these experiments, we compared antibody responses measured using the PN assay to those measured by the MN and HI assays.",

Firstly, pseudotype particles undergo a single-round of replication in the indicator cell line and do not produce infectious progeny viruses. Therefore, the PN assay does not require BSL-3 containment facilities. Secondly, unlike the HI assay the PN assay directly measures the effect of neutralizing antibody on blocking virus entry into the cell. And thirdly, the PN assay is more rapid since the MN assay takes 5\u20136 days to complete; while the PN assay can be conducted in as few as 2\u20133 days.",

In this study, we show that pseudotypes co-expressing HA and NA have much higher transduction efficiency than pseudotypes expressing H5HA alone plus exogenous NA, suggesting that co-transfection of lentiviral transfer vector with H5HA alone with exogenous NA treatment during pseudotype release results in lower levels of pseudotype production as compared to pseudotypes co-expressing both HA and NA. Moreover, we show that there is significant quantitative difference in antigenecity and immunogenecity among different hemagglutinins from the various H5N1 clades and subclades.

In addition, pseudotypes expressing other subtypes of HA and NA should also be studied, particularly in view of three recent reports showing that various anti-H5HA monoclonal antibodies generated from HPAI H5N1 infected individuals or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies generated from seasonal influenza vaccination cross-reacted with HA from other influenza subtypes [29], [30], [31].",
