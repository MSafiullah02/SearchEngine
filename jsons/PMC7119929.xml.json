To prepare for the future, we have to learn from the past events, and this involves analysis of recent occurrences in influenza activity, including epizootic outbreaks. Rapid transportation by airplanes and a much larger global population than existed just over a century ago, during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, may result in greater human suffering. Modernization of the global healthcare facilities and effective medicines and vaccines will likely prevent a repeat of the 1918 explosive mortality rate, and the brunt of a virulent influenza pandemic will be borne by the poorer countries, the debilitated elderly, pregnant women, and the growing number of people with immunosuppression.",

            "text": "The influenza viruses are enveloped viruses of family, with influenza A and B causing annual seasonal excess morbidity and mortality and influenza C a milder respiratory illness [1]. Only influenza A viruses are true zoonotic agents responsible for influenza pandemics, and influenza B and C are primarily human pathogens, but influenza C occasionally infects pigs and dogs [2]. The morphology of the influenza viruses includes segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes, surrounded by nucleoprotein envelope and covered with surface projections or spikes [1]. These surface spikes are glycoproteins with hemagglutinin [HA] or neuraminidase [NA] activity that are the main targets of the host humoral immune response. The influenza A viruses can be subtyped according to the antigenic nature of their surface glycoproteins, with 16\u201317 HA and 9\u201310 NA identified to date. The HA serves as the receptor-binding protein and facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane [3]. NA is responsible for assisting virus entry into cell by mucus degradation [4] and release and spread of the progeny virions [4]. There are eight RNA segments within the viral genome, encoding 10\u201311 proteins.",

            "text": "Influenza A and B viruses frequently undergo antigenic variation of the surface glycoproteins [HA and NA] that allow the viruses to evade human neutralization from previous exposures and vaccinations. Variation in the viruses is caused by accumulation of point mutations in the HA and NA genes, antigenic drift [5, 6]. A variety of mutations including substitutions and deletions result in genetic variation during antigenic drift. The gradual accumulation of amino acid changes that occur with antigenic drift on the HA and NA sites allows the virus to survive, due to ineffective neutralization, and replaces existing strains as the predominant circulating virus in the population, to cause yearly outbreaks [1]. The propensity of influenza viruses for multiple mutations and rapid antigenic variation may be due to evolutionary effect of selective pressure for self-preservation. High error rate or mutations during genomic replication are typical of RNA viruses, as the RNA polymerase lacks proofreading activity, and the segmental influenza virus genome facilitates reassortment between different viral strains that infect the same cell [6\u20138].",

            "text": "A major antigenic variation, called antigenic shift, that usually precedes a pandemic occurs only in influenza A viruses and by a different mechanism. Antigenic shift results in the introduction of a new HA, with or without a new NA, to introduce a new virus to which the population is na\u00efve, lacking any or even partial immunity [1, 6]. This pattern of replacement of previous HA and NA in new subtypes of influenza A viruses is associated with emergence of pandemic influenza outbreaks over the last century. Antigenic shift may occur by at least two different mechanisms. A zoonotic influenza virus can be transmitted from an animal reservoir without reassortment, usually by adaptation to a mammalian or human receptor site by mutation [1, 6]. The other mechanism is by reassortment, when two or more viruses coinfect the same cell and exchange one or more RNA segments to produce new progeny virus with new antigenic HA [with or without new NA] and new biological properties [7]. Swine is commonly believed to be the \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for genetic reassortment, as they are susceptible to infection with both avian and human strains and swine strains of influenza viruses [9]. The Asian influenza pandemic of 1957 and the Hong Kong influenza pandemic of 1968 were the result of antigenic shift with reassortment of genetic material during dual infection with circulating human influenza strains, H1N1 in 1957 and H2N2 in 1968, and avian influenza strains, probably with pigs as the mixing vessel [10, 11].",

Most influenza viruses are restricted to specific hosts, but some strains can circulate among several animal species, i.e., H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are endemic in humans, birds, and pigs [12]. The primary determinant of host tropism and transmission is directly related to the specificity and affinity of the viral HA for the host receptor. Sialic acid is the receptor for influenza viruses that binds to the viral HA. Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid molecules with specific side chains with \u03b1-2,3-linkages and mammalian viruses to \u03b1-2,6-linkages [6]. Human-adapted seasonal viruses such as H1N1 and H3N2 have high affinity for \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid [SA], which are expressed on the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract [URT] of humans [12]. Avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to galactose-linked \u03b1-2,3-SA which is found abundantly in the URT and gut of birds, but is also found in the lower respiratory tract epithelium of humans [12]. Hence, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [HPAIVs] not well adapted to human receptors can cause limited avian to human transmission with viral pneumonia by this mechanism. The tracheal epithelium of pigs contain receptors with both \u03b1-2,3-SA and \u03b1-2,6-SA linkages and be infected simultaneously with avian and human [mammalian] influenza viruses that predispose to reassortment of zoonotic and human strains [12].

There are numerous examples of cross-species transmission of influenza virus from avian to mammalian species and intra-mammalian cross-species infection [15]. Specific subtypes of influenza viruses differ in their ability to cross the species barrier, and viral and host factors are important in the transmission. The segmental nature of the influenza genome is considered important in the viral evolution and cross-species transmission. Host range restriction of species transmission is governed by several viral proteins, but HA is critical to bind to host receptor to allow invasion and replication. Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,3-SA receptors in intestinal epithelial cells, whereas human influenza viruses HA bind more favorably to respiratory epithelial receptors with \u03b1-2,3-SA [19]. Thus, avian influenza viruses usually cannot replicate effectively in humans, and birds are less susceptible to human viruses. NA also contributes to the virus-species host specificity as efficient growth of influenza A virus depends on the balance between HA receptor-binding affinity and the NA receptor-cleaving activity [9]. The viral polymerase basic protein-2 is important in virus replication and is a host range determinant [20].",

Documentation of primary avian influenza viruses in swine has been reported over the years in different regions of the world: in European swine in 1979, pigs from China and Asia multiple times, and in Canadian swine in 2000\u20132004 [9].

The speed of the pandemic was rapid by June 2009; 73 countries had reported 26,000 confirmed cases. The initial outbreak in Mexico was the most worrisome, as 6.5% of hospitalized patients became critically ill and 41% of these patients died [36]. By August 2010, nearly all countries in the world reported confirmed cases of the pandemic H1N1 influenza, but the global outbreak started to wane. Although experts considered the 2009 pandemic a mild outbreak, there was marked variation in the severity of the disease in different regions of the world [37]. Unlike seasonal influenza outbreaks, and similar to the 1918 pandemic, older adults fared relatively well, and excess mortality and adverse outcome were greater in children, young adults, and pregnant women [35]. Estimates of the influenza-related deaths worldwide, 123,000\u2013203,000, were similar to that of mild seasonal influenza [37]. Baseline pre-existing immunity at the start of the 2009 pandemic was nonexistent in children and very low in those born after 1980, but greater in older adults [38, 39].",

Experimentally, however, intravenous inoculation of LPAIV can result in replication of the virus in the kidney and intestinal epithelial cells of chickens [63].",

Tropism of the influenza viruses is in large part determined by the receptor-binding affinity of the HA protein. Avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to receptor with \u03b1-2,3-SA to galactose, which are abundant in the intestinal and respiratory epithelium of domestic and wild birds but are also present in other tissues [heart, kidney, and brain] and endothelium in ducks and chickens [64]. Binding of avian influenza in humans occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract where \u03b1-2,3-SA linkages are present focally in bronchiolar epithelial cells, type 11 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, acinar cells of the submucosal glands of the trachea and bronchi, and epithelial cells\nof the eye [65\u201367].",

Although the virus likely originated from poultry as a result of mutations of a LPAIV , it appears to have infected wild birds, which subsequently caused spill-back infection to poultry in distant regions. Migrating aquatic wild birds were considered responsible for long-distance dispersal of the HPAIV H5N1 from Qinghai Lake [China] to Europe, Russia, and Africa [69]. The ancestor virus was initially isolated from domestic geese in China, but the prime long-distance vector appeared to be the wild mallard ducks, as they showed abundant viruses excretion without clinical or debilitating disease [70]. Over 100 million birds have died from the infection either naturally or from culling to limit the spread of the disease. In Thailand which had seven waves of HPAIV H5N1\noutbreaks, >62 million poultry have died and outbreaks in poultry were associated with increased infection in wild birds in the preceding months [71].",

All the genes were of avian origin with no evidence of reassortment with human influenza virus. The human isolates were resistant to amantadine but were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors [72]. Isolation of the first human HPAIV H5N1 occurred in a child in Hong Kong in 1997, and this raised fears of an impending H5N1 pandemic [73]. Subsequently only 608 human cases had occurred up to August 2012 from 15 countries [74]. Most cases were related to contact with poultry or poultry products, and occasionally from contaminated water and human transmission appeared to be rare [74]. No human cases were reported from Western Europe or the Americas. The high case fatality rate reported to the WHO of about 59% was most likely an over estimate from unrecognized mild infections or subclinical cases. A recent prospective serological epidemiology study from Egypt, where most cases of H5N1 were reported since 2009 from backyard poultry producers, found that most seroconverters were asymptomatic or had mild disease [56]. Thus the true case fatality rate is likely very low. Although HPAIV H5N1 continue to circulate in poultry, spill over infection in humans and other mammals have remained rare. Hence so far, the HPAIV H5N1 has not mutated to allow facile transmission from poultry to humans\nor human to human.",

            "text": "Over the past several years, other avian influenza A viruses\nof subtypes H6, H7, H9, and H10 have crossed the species barrier and caused mainly sporadic, nonfatal cases of human infections [55, 75\u201379]. Some of these cases were secondary to low pathogenic strains that caused disease in persons with immunosuppression. However, a H7N7 strain caused human conjunctivitis and a case of fatal respiratory distress syndrome in the Netherlands [79]. Of major global public health concern is the emergence of a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus in China in March 2013. Within two months of its appearance in the human population, the cumulative number of human cases in China was almost three times as high as the number caused by the H5N1 outbreak during a similar period of time [80]. By June 2013, there were 132 symptomatic cases and one asymptomatic case with 40 attributable deaths [81]. Infection with the H7N9 virus has been associated with a high incidence of severe disease, with rapidly progressive pneumonia and multiorgan failure associated with cytokine \u201cstorm\u201d or severe dysfunction [81, 82]. In a review of 139 confirmed cases in China that occurred in the first 9 months of the outbreak, 99% were hospitalized, 90% had severe pneumonia or respiratory failure, and 63% required intensive care and 34% of the total cases died [83]. The first cases of H7N9 influenza infection appeared in eastern China around the Yangtze River delta and subsequently spread to 12 regions in China along an avian migratory pathway [81, 84]. Most cases were associated with exposure\nto poultry [82%], but in four family clusters, non-sustained human-to-human transmission could not be excluded [83]. At the onset of the outbreak in eastern China, there was no apparent outbreak in poultry or in wild birds. Analysis of the virus showed all gene segments were of avian origin, and the H7 isolated virus was closest to that of H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, but the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea [85]. The H7N9 virus has been isolated from live poultry and the environment of poultry markets; and case-control studies confirmed the association of human infection with visits to these markets [83]. Moreover, closure of live poultry markets have resulted in the reduction of confirmed H7N9 influenza cases. The H7N9 avian influenza virus potentially poses a high risk to human populations, which are na\u00efve to the virus, as the virus has biological properties conducive to aggressive disease in mammals. Studies have confirmed that the H7N9 virus can bind to both avian and human receptor and it can replicate efficiently in several mammalian cell lines, including human lower respiratory tract epithelial cells and type 11 pneumocytes of alveoli [86]. H7N9 avian virus replicated to higher titer in human respiratory epithelial cells and respiratory tract of ferrets compared to seasonal influenza H3N2 virus and produced greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to other genetically related virus\n[87].",

            "text": "A unique feature of avian influenza A H7N9 human outbreak has been the absence of preceding bird epidemics with die off of poultry or wild birds. Thus, H7N9 appears to be a LPAIV with asymptomatic or mild infection in domestic and wild birds. This is attributable to the absence of a multibasic cleavage site of the HA, which is a virulence marker in birds but not in humans [85]. Also previous infection in poultry with a closely related LPAIV [H7N3] may have elicited cross-protection in birds [81]. Hence, the distribution of H7N9 in poultry and wild birds is poorly characterized and is only retrospectively recognized after human outbreaks. Thus the H7N9 avian virus potentially is a greater risk than the H5N1 to produce widespread epidemics in human populations\nbecause of its stealth. So far human infection occurrence has been limited to mainland China, including 19 cases diagnosed in Taipei [Taiwan], Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia [90]. As of February 2015, a total 571 confirmed human cases of H7N9 infection has been reported to WHO with 212 [37.1%] deaths [91]. However, the true case fatality rate appears to be much lower as only the severe cases are recognized clinically. A recent seroprevalence study from southern China in poultry workers found that 7.2% in spring and 14.9% in winter have been infected with the H7N9 influenza virus with subclinical or mild infection [92].",

It is estimated that 58 billion poultry are raised each year in the world, and fowl plague may have affected only a fraction of about 250 million birds per year. Most HPAIV epizootics involved single countries, and only two have embroiled multiple countries, H5N1 since 1996 to present in 63 countries of Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa and H7N7 in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany [95]. Vaccination of poultry had been used in four epizootics to control the outbreaks because of inadequate control with traditional means. These include: Mexico in1994\u20131995 for H5N1 epizootic, Pakistan in 1995\u20132004 for H7N3 epizootics, Asia/Africa/Europe from 1996 to present to control the ongoing H5N1 epizootics, and North Korea in 2005 for a H7N7 epizootic [95]. From 2002 to 2010, over 13 billion doses of avian influenza vaccines had been used in poultry, inactivated whole virus vaccines in 95.5% and live vectored vaccines in 4.5% [96].

Over 99% of vaccines used for HPAIV H5N1 were for the four enzootic countries: China, including Hong Kong [91%], Egypt [4.7%], Indonesia [2.3%], and Vietnam [1.4%] where vaccination programs have been routine and nationwide to all poultry [96]. Bangladesh and Eastern India have enzootic H5N1 HPAIV but have not used vaccination in their control programs.",

However, vaccines in development against these viruses have been weakly immunogenic. Two recent studies using adjuvanted vaccines showed promise for the development of effective avian influenza vaccines in humans, but likely with multiple doses. Various doses of a monovalent inactivated surface antigen H5N1 influenza vaccine, with or without the MF59 adjuvant, were tested in 565 vaccine-na\u00efve adults and 72 subjects who were vaccinated a year before with an older Vietnam vaccine [99]. Low-dose adjuvanted vaccine was more effective than high-dose unadjuvanted vaccine after two doses given 28 days apart in generating effective hemagglutinin inhibition titers of >1:40, but local and systemic reactions were higher. A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant had a boosting effect on subjects vaccinated a year before in 21\u201350% [99]. Another recent study assessed the immune response to a split virus inactivated monovalent avian influenza H7N9 vaccine with or without the same adjuvant [100]. The vaccine was given twice 28 days apart in various doses in 700 participants in seven groups. At the lowest dose with adjuvant seroconversion occurred in 59% of subjects, but there was no data on antibody titer after 42 days. There was no serious reaction to the vaccine, but subjects given adjuvants had greater local reaction than those without. An unexpected finding was the attenuated response in participants\nwho received recent seasonal influenza vaccine, similar to the response in older subjects. Another approach is the administration of priming, live attenuated influenza vaccine [pLAIV] against influenza A [H7N9], followed 12 weeks after with the candidate pandemic inactivated unadjuvanted influenza vaccine [pIIV]. A study in healthy young and older [18\u201349 years and 50\u201370 years] volunteers demonstrated strong immune memory with subsequent antigenic challenge [101].",

Furthermore, it is unknown whether or not a hemagglutinin inhibition or neutralizing antibody titer of >1:40 would be effective to prevent human infection with the avian influenza viruses [102]. A model on the efficacy of vaccination program in the setting of an emerging influenza pandemic found that timeliness of vaccine production and administration would have the greatest impact even for an effective vaccine [103]. Starting a vaccination program in the US 16 weeks before the onset of a major epidemic, with an estimated 30% clinical attack rate and production of 30 million doses per week, would result in 38% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. Delaying the start of the vaccination program to the same week of an outbreak decreases the reductions in severe morbidity and mortality to only 18% [103]. In addition, administering only 10 million doses per week would result in lower benefit to 21% with an early program\nand to 6% when delayed.",

It was estimated that the demands could be met with the current supply available. Early treatment with these antivirals could prevent 5200\u2013248,000 deaths and 4800\u2013504,000 hospitalizations, but there still would be large number of deaths [25,000\u2013425,000] and hospitalization [500,000\u20133,700,000] [109]. Although there is no good clinical evidence on the efficacy of NAIs against the avian influenza strains H5N1 and H7N9, these viruses have been found to be susceptible in vitro. Data collected on patients with severe H5N1 avian influenza infection treated with oseltamivir showed limited efficacy with mortality rate still around 50% [110, 111]. Furthermore, during the first wave of human infection with H7N9, six patients treated with NAI had developed resistant variants, and three died [112]. A NA-R292 K mutation that confers broad-spectrum NAIs resistance after treatment was detected. Prospective data on all patients infected with H7N9 and treated with a NAI\nshould be collected and screened for mutations to determine the frequency of antiviral resistance.",

These include: (1) measures to prevent and reduce cross-species transmission, (2) means of improving vaccine efficacy and rapid production of large supplies, (3) development of more effective novel antiviral agents, and (4) improvement in the coordinated global emergency response to an emerging influenza pandemic. In order to prevent cross-species transmission of zoonotic influenza, further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and mutations necessary for this to occur. The pragmatic approach taken in Hong Kong when faced by an outbreak of zoonotic influenza does not provide a permanent solution. Modern hygienic facilities for animal husbandry are needed in developing countries, and plans to fade out live animal markets and local backyard farms need to be gradually implemented.",

            "text": "Use of animal vaccines for epizootic and enzootic influenza viruses should be expanded to more countries and greater proportion of animals for both HPAIV and LPAIV . However, the constant antigenic shift and drift of the influenza viruses poses significant challenges to develop and mass produce new vaccines every year for both humans and animals. The ideal solution would be the development of a universal vaccine that covers all strains with development of antibodies to non-variable and highly immunogenic epitopes. Current vaccines are based on administration of purified immunodominant envelope glycoproteins [HA and NA], which are highly variable and drift under immune pressure. In addition most neutralizing antibodies are directed against the strain-specific globular head of HA [98]. Development of more broadly neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies with novel vaccines should be feasible, against receptor-binding site on HA1 subunit and the fusion machinery of the HA2 subunit [113]. The most pressing need, however, as demonstrated by the 2009 pandemic, is to produce sufficient influenza vaccines for a novel strain in a short period of time for an impending epidemic. The traditional influenza vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs cultures and require a lead time of 6 months for production of a new vaccine in sufficient quantities. The cell culture systems can produce the vaccines more rapidly, but the amount of antigens produced is less than with eggs. Several approaches will be needed to overcome these limitations such as licensing more companies to make influenza vaccines and encourage rapidly developing countries [China, India, and Brazil] to produce influenza vaccines for their own and the regional needs and more reliance on cell culture methods. Also lower doses of vaccines can be given by intradermal injection and may be just as or more effective than intramuscular administration and hence provide a greater supply of vaccines. The safety and efficacy of live attenuated avian influenza vaccines in humans should be assessed. Currently live attenuated intranasal seasonal influenza vaccines are available for children and young adults. The present evidence indicates that these vaccines are safe and more immunogenic than conventional inactivated vaccines and can produce longer-lasting antibodies. The fear that the live virus in these vaccines could mutate to become more virulent and cause influenza disease has not been found to date.",

Peramivir is now available in the US for intravenous therapy, but this agent has the disadvantages of the NAI-class, questionable efficacy for avian influenza and increasing reports of drug resistance. A promising drug is a new broad-spectrum antiviral agent favipiravir [Toyama Chemical], which is approved for emergency treatment of influenza virus in Japan [114]. Potential targets for development of new agents include polymerase inhibitors [i.e., T-705] and attachment inhibitors [i.e., DAS-181] [115]. Patients with acute lung injury [ARDS] secondary to avian influenza have a high mortality, and antihuman anticomplement C5a antibody may be an effective novel treatment that should be tested in humans. A recent study in monkeys with avian H7N9 influenza virus infection demonstrated that anti-C5a significantly reduced the systemic inflammatory response and the viral load in the lungs [116]. Intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] contains broadly cross-reactive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against heterologous influenza strains [including the swine H1N1 strain] and has been proposed for use in critically ill patients with influenza [117]. However, for patients infected with an emerging avian influenza virus, the source of the IVIG would preferably be derived from previously exposed subjects with evidence of existing antibodies to the avian virus .",

Better understanding of mechanisms of cross-species transmission is direly needed in order to prevent these happenings. Although current data shows no impending risk of a major avian or zoonotic influenza major outbreak, continued surveillance and vigilance should be maintained. Presently the two avian viruses of public health interest [H5N1 and H7N9] have not mutated to become more easily transmissible from birds to humans or humans to humans. However, of some concern is a recent report from China of a probable nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A [H7N9]. A 57-year-old male, with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease, developed acute influenza A after sharing the same hospital ward with an index patient for 5 days. The index patient became ill 7 days after visiting a poultry market, but the secondary case had no bird contact. Both patients died and the influenza A [H7N9] isolated from both patients genome sequences were nearly identical and genetically similar to the virus isolated from the live poultry market [118]. Thus, continuous monitoring for further cases of human-to-human transmission for this avian influenza virus is critical.",
