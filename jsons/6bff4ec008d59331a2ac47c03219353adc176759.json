A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of outpatient departments in US hospitals reported that 10.2% of the 84.6 million visits were owing to symptoms referable to the respiratory system, cough being the principal motivator for the visit. This same survey showed that the primary diagnoses for these patients were acute upper respiratory infections (URIs) (1) . In 2002, cough was responsible for bringing 3 of the 110 million patients to emergency departments in the United States-11.8% of which had diagnoses of ill-defined conditions and diseases of the respiratory system (2) . Another study conducted to examine the epidemiology of and recent trends in outpatient visits for infectious disease, reported that approximately 200 out of every 1000 office visits were related to URIs (3) .",

A 1997 study concluded that the annual cost per capita employer expenditures for patients with respiratory infections totaled $4397.

Cough is induced by inflammation or irritation of the larynx, trachea, or bronchi. (To review the physiology of the cough reflex, please see Chapter 14.) Cough is a symptom whose physical characteristics (dry, productive, whooping, staccato, and so on) can often give valuable clues to the disease underlying this symptom (7) . Furthermore, an effective cough depends on the ability to achieve high gas flows and velocities through the airways. Expiratory or inspiratory muscle weakness, disordered chest wall motion, altered mucus rheology, and altered mucociliary function all may affect coughing and must be kept in mind when evaluating a patient with pre-existing conditions (6) .",

The mechanism of this cough is a transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the primary symptoms of this process include phlegm production and wheezing (8, 10, 11) . Cough resulting from allergic rhinitis or environmental irritant rhinitis is caused by inflammation of the respiratory passages by some agent to which the patient is sensitive. There are countless numbers of irritants that cause this condition and they may be unique from patient to patient. Some of the more common agents are dog and cat hair, pet dander, dust mites, pollens, molds, and feathers. These irritants cause excess mucus production and postnasal drip, which triggers the cough reflex. A good history can identify these mechanisms as the culprits for the cough (6) .",

Because of the lack of efficacy and low complication rates, antibiotic treatment of children with URIs is not supported by current evidence from randomized trials (21) . Specifically, randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted in the past 25 years have failed to support the role of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis, either in the reduction of severity of symptoms (acute cough) or the duration of this condition (10, 11) . Meta-analysis of these trials report no impact of antibiotics on illness duration, activity limitation, or work loss, but have shown that the inhaled bronchodilator albuterol decreases the duration of the cough (8, 10, 11) .

In allergic rhinitis/environmental irritant, the simple treatment is avoiding the offending allergens or agents and using an antihistamine, such as loratidine, to alleviate symptoms (9). 2. In acute bacterial sinusitis, treatment includes dexbrompheniramine plus pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline and an antibiotic directed against S. pneumonia and H. influenza (8, 9) . 3. In the case of COPD exacerbation, the recommendations are an antibiotic directed against S. pneumonia and H. influenza, systemic corticosteroids tapered over 2 weeks, continuous O 2 if PaO 2 is 55 mmHg or less or SaO 2 is 88% or less, and ipratropium plus albuterol treatments (9). 4. In acute bronchitis, it is recommended to treat acute cough with dextromethorphan or codeine, a bronchodilator, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen for pain relief. Because one of the most common causes of acute cough is the influenza virus, a flu vaccine will help prevent the condition in the first place. If influenza is suspected as the cause, the antiviral amantidine or rimantidine can be used but must be initiated within 48 hours of diagnosis (10, 11) . 5. For Bordetella pertussis infections, a 14-day course of erythromycin or bactrim is the recommended treatment for acute cough (9). Finally, prevention and prophylaxis is an important component in the care of our patients, especially our elderly and at-risk patients. Annual immunization against influenza is standard practice for these two groups. Vaccination against S. pneumonia with the Pneumovax \u00ae is also recommended for at-risk groups and will help to prevent many of the acute cough illnesses described earlier (8) .",

Lost work days, absenteeism from school, money spent on ineffective OTC treatments, and time and resources wasted in emergency departments and primary care offices would be significantly curtailed if we could identify effective self-care treatments with rigorously designed studies. Future studies using outcome measures that can be easily assessed in a primary care setting and that produce clinically meaningful results, such as patient satisfaction, relief of nighttime disturbance, side effects, or time to return to normal daily activities, are needed (6, 9, 19, 20) .",

It is an exciting prospect for practitioners to possibly have a therapeutic option someday that actually addresses the etiology of the acute cough by reducing the viral load.",
