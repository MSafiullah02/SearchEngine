Governments have ordered nationwide lockdowns (often suddenly) in an attempt to contain the spread of infection. Such measures have posed unexpected challenges to patients with pre-existing diseases, especially in limitedresource settings. In the current report, we describe the unique hardships confronted by main Q2 tenance of in-center hemodialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients in India during the current lockdown period.",

The majority of dialysis units are located in private hospitals. As part of the COVID-19 response, governments have taken over management of a number of private hospitals 4 and ordered the closure of down Q3 dialysis units. In some instances, units were closed down and staff were placed in quarantine after a patient or health care worker was found to be COVID-19 positive. 5 In all such instances, patients are asked to go to other dialysis facilities, which in most instances already are working to capacity. Moreover, dialysis centers are not willing Q4 to accept newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease patients or patients shifted from closed units as a result of panic and misinformation and insist that they produce a coronavirus Q5 test result. 6 Deaths have been reported as a result of such delays. 7 A lack of appropriate education of the dialysis workforce, combined with stigma and misinformation on social media, has created apprehension among dialysis staff. Despite the general recommendation that any quarantine should not result in loss of pay, this remains a real risk to staff in private settings.",
