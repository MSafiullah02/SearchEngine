On 21 February 2003 a physician from Guangdong Province, ill with atypical pneumonia, visited Hong Kong and stayed overnight in Hotel M. The agent that caused his illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), was transmitted to at least 10 persons, who subsequently initiated outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore, Viet Nam, and Canada [1]. Thus a global outbreak was initiated.",

Missing potential contacts, on the other hand, sometimes led to unrecognised disease and substantial transmission, as illustrated by one instance in Canada [6] and one in Taiwan [7].

Reports of multiple independent early cases from Guangdong Province during the first outbreak in November 2002 and February 2003, and reports of non-linked cases during the second outbreak in December 2003 and January 2004 [5], [31], suggested that the animal reservoir for SARS CoV had contact with humans, directly or indirectly, in multiple locations. Initial studies in humans and animals in wild-animal markets in Guangdong Province suggested that animals in these markets might be the source of human infection (Table 3\n) [32]. However, subsequent studies showed that SARS infection in animals before arrival in the markets was uncommon and these animals were therefore not the original reservoir of the outbreak virus.",

In these studies, horseshoe bats from China were shown to have a high rate of antibodies that reacted against SARS CoV antigens or a high level of SARS CoV-like RNA in faecal specimens (Table 4\n). The sequences of the amplified RNA were closely related but not identical to SARS CoV, with \u223c8% differences from SARS CoV in multiple genes. This level of difference was too great for the RNA to be from the parent to the outbreak virus. However, the presence of multiple SARS CoV-like viruses, the inability to detect SARS CoV-like viruses in other species of wild-living animals and the detection of a wide range of other coronaviruses in bats suggests that they are a rich source of coronaviruses and the most likely animal reservoir for the SARS outbreak virus [35], [36], [37].",

The investigators identified critical amino acids in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the globally spread virus that were associated with increased binding efficiency to the human ACE2 molecule.

Broadly reactive PCR assays have subsequently been used to detect a wide variety of coronaviruses in bat faecal specimens [35], [36], [37]. Sequence studies of the amplified genome have shown a wide range of coronaviruses representing the previously identified group I and II viruses, including a variety of bat SARS CoV-like viruses, none of which, as noted above, is the parent to the outbreak viruses.
