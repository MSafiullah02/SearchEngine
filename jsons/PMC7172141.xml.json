This finding, along with the positive correlations found between IL-33 and IL-5/IL-13, may further indicate that IL-33 is indeed driving type 2 inflammation during exacerbations via IL-5 & IL-13. Although we did not observe an association with sputum eosinophils, there was a trend towards IL-33 being positively correlated with blood eosinophils. Overall the mRNA expression results supported the protein findings. Interestingly, despite improvement in lung function and symptom control at the four-week follow-up, the level of eosinophilic inflammation and type 2 cytokine did not decrease, nor did IL-33. This suggests that airway inflammation persists for a significant period of time after an exacerbation, and that IL-33 is part of this perpetuated inflammatory response.",

This could indicate independent transcriptional and translational regulation of IL-33. A possible explanation could be the timing of sampling during the exacerbation: Patients underwent sampling up to 24 h after being admitted to hospital, and after having received systemic steroid treatment. Hence, most likely, mRNA expression could have been suppressed at time of exacerbation sampling due to corticosteroids anti-inflammatory actions, as mRNA was being degraded faster than protein [21].",

This was not seen at the protein level. This may potentially represent a negative feedback loop, in which mRNA expression is suppressed in patients with type 2 inflammation. In keeping with this observation, we have previously reported a study that showed IL-33 immunoreactivity was negatively correlated with an extended panel of markers of airway and systemic eosinophilia in stable asthma [20].

Another limitation is the relatively small sample size, which limited the statistical power. In spite of this, we were able to demonstrate strong correlations between IL-33 and IL-5 and IL-13, providing supportive evidence that IL-33 plays a significant role in acute asthma. The lack of statistical power however made it impossible to conclude on any difference in certain subgroups of patients e.g. rhinovirus positive/negative patients. Another potential limitation of this study is the timing issue of when to sample patients: Patients were examined as soon as their clinical state allowed. However, this represents different stages of the natural course of an exacerbation introducing additionally heterogeneity between the samples.",

This suggests that for future studies, nasal swab samples might be used to indirectly assess the immune responses of the lower airways. Nasal swabs would represent a relatively easy airway sampling methods but need to be further validated in a larger sample of asthma patients. Furthermore it doesn't require complex laboratory resources and is therefore suited for the clinical setting. It can be done bedside in the emergency room immediately after admission, and while the stabilising treatment is given, therefore providing airway material before corticosteroid administration, since it is established that corticosteroids can alter gene expression. Nasal swabs were obtained within 24 h of admission to hospital, and not immediately after admission. However, we suggest, that this would be possible in future studies.",
