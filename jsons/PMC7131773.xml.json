            "text": "Influenza viruses remain significant causes of ARI every year despite availability of vaccines and increasing efforts to achieve targeted vaccination rates. In 1998, these viruses were estimated to cause 39,000 hospitalizations per year in children nationally in the US.1 The outpatient visits associated with influenza were reported to be approximately 10, 100, and 250 times as high as hospitalization rates for children 0 to 5 months, 6 to 23 months, and 24 to 59 months of age, respectively.5 Substantial burden from influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths has been ascertained in several studies, most severely affecting those older than 65 years but also being significant in the 50- to 65-year-old adults, in whom hospitalization rates were determined to equal those among children younger than 5 years.6 Antigen assays for the detection of influenza are commonly available. The likelihood of a negative result using these assays increases significantly with the increasing age of the patient, whereas virus culture and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) do not; for older patients, RT-PCR or culture is necessary to avoid false-negative results.7\n",

            "text": "Molecular methods for detecting influenza viruses were described as early as 1991. Various targets, including the matrix, HA, and N genes have been used. The first commercially available assay was the Hexaplex assay (Prodesse Inc, Waukesha, Wisconsin), an RT-PCR assay that employed enzyme hybridization postamplification detection. The assay was technically demanding, requiring postamplification purification; it was also expensive and took 8 to 9 hours to complete.8 This assay had an analytical sensitivity of 10 copies for influenza A and 5 copies for influenza B9 and set the standard for the detection of influenza viruses. Since then, it has been redesigned and is now an FDA-approved multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay (Pro-Flu+, Prodesse Inc,) for detecting influenza A (M gene), influenza B (NS1 and NS2 genes), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (polymerase gene). It can be performed using a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana), or the NucliSens easyMAG System (bioMerieux Inc, Durham, North Carolina) for extraction with amplification and detection on the SmartCycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California). According to the manufacturer, it has a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93% for influenza A and 98% and 99% for influenza B, respectively, and an analytical sensitivity of 102 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL for both viruses. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) also is an FDA-approved multiplex panel for detecting respiratory viruses. While capable of detecting 17 respiratory viruses, it is FDA-approved for detecting RSV; parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; metapneumovirus; adenovirus, and rhinovirus, in addition to influenza. The assay employs multiplex PCR and fluid microsphere-based array detection on the Luminex x-MAP system (flow cytometer). It has a reported clinical sensitivity of 100% for influenza A10 and an analytical sensitivity of 10 TCID50.\n11 In addition to these FDA-approved assays, ASRs for influenza are commercially available from EraGen Biosciences (Madison, Wisconsin) and Cepheid (Sunnyvale, California). These assays have no performance claims made by the manufacturer, and little information is published regarding their performance. The literature is replete with home-brew or in-house developed assays for detecting influenza using various amplification methodologies. In evaluating a home-brew assay or an ASR, an analytical sensitivity of 10 TCID50 is desirable. In comparison with antigen assays and culture, clinical sensitivity of 98% to 99% should be easily attainable, along with the detection of additional viruses missed by culture. An alternate PCR methodology can confirm these as true positive specimens. PCR-based respiratory virus assays have demonstrated significantly better sensitivity than antigen detection assays, both enzyme immunoassays7, 12 where adults may have a false-negative rate of up to 29%,13 and immunofluorescent assays14 They also have better sensitivity than culture15, 16 in children17 and particularly in adults.18, 19, 20 Several manufacturers have assays available as research use only (RUO) kits. There are several kits, the MultiCode-PLx (EraGen Biosciences, Inc) and the ResPlex II Panel (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, California), that employ the Luminex system, and these have reported performance claims similar to the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel.21, 22, 23 Automated solid film microarray assays also are being developed,24 but none are commercially available.",

Two new CoVs, however, CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU1, were described in 2004 and 2005 respectively. These viruses, although newly discovered, subsequently have been shown to have been circulating in people for a long time. These new CoVs have been associated with both URIs and LRIs.46 No assay is approved by the FDA for detecting CoV. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel is not FDA-approved for CoV but has been used to study the epidemiology of the virus. It has an analytical sensitivity of 50 genome equivalents.33 The MultiCode-PLx RUO assay includes CoVs except for HKU1.

Solid-phase microarrays allow for a large number of probes to be employed and also may allow for variable hybridization conditions such that detection of a large number of targets or mismatched targets can be accomplished. Suspension microarrays employ a liquid phase bead conjugated array. These allow for rapid hybridization conditions and flexibility in assay design. Bead makeup can be modified easily.
