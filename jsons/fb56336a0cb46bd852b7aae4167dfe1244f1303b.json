On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.",

The AUC of an ideal model is near 1 which means that it can measure separability in the best way possible. Conversely, the AUC of an imperfect model is near 0 which implies that it can measure separability in the worst way possible. At P1, the threshold is more than one and only FN and TN are activated. Reciprocally, at P2, the threshold is less than zero and only TP and FP are activated. In the ROC curve, P3 which is called the optimum or cut-off point has the minimum distance from the point (0, 1).

In the ROC curves, the sensitivity axis is based on the true positive rate and the specificity axis is based on the true negative rate. In other words, the horizontal axis signifies the design variable and the vertical axis implies the sensitivity of the same variable. Fig. 6 demonstrates the ROC curve of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the AT variations in different provinces of Iran. The AUC of the AT model is approximately 0.5. It can be observed that the AT model has no capacity to distinguish between positive and negative classes. Moreover, it can be seen that the behavior of the AT model is similar to that of an imperfect model which indicates that the AT model does not have a high performance. As marked in Fig. 6 , the accurate coordinates of the cutoff or optimum point are P3 (0.486, 0.505). The cut-off point confirms that the spread level of coronavirus in provinces with a temperature of less than 17\u00b0C is slightly more than that of the other provinces. It can be concluded that the transmission rate of coronavirus does not have a high sensibility versus the AT parameter in different provinces of Iran since the AT parameter has a linear relationship with the number of people afflicted with COVID-19. Therefore, there is no scientific reason to assume that the number of people afflicted with COVID-19 in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.",

The higher the AUC, the better the model is able to distinguish between the patient people and the healthy ones. Fig. 7 shows the ROC curve of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the variations of PS in different provinces of Iran. The AUC of the PS model is approximately 0.8. It can be understood that the PS model has a relative capacity to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. In contrast to the AT model, the PS model has a nonlinear behavior which indicates that it has a higher sensitivity than the AT model. Therefore, it can be deduced that the transmission rate of coronavirus has a high sensitivity to the PS parameter in different provinces of Iran since it has a nonlinear relationship with the number of people afflicted with COVID-19. As marked in Fig. 7 , the precise coordinates of the cut-off or optimum point are P3 (0.274, 0.686). The cut-off point confirms that the transmission rate of coronavirus in provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people is more than that of the other provinces. According to the findings of the current paper, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.
