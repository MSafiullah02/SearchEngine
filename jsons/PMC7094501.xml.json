Patients with COPD recover more slowly than those without COPD. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. Some have speculated that recovery may be slowed because of unexplained pathophysiologic mechanisms that include mucosal damage from the disease, deterioration in lung function, or release of histamine or other inflammatory mediators.3 A recent study by Seemungal et al8 has reported higher IL-6 levels in patients with COPD with exacerbations and a slower clinical recovery in virus-proven infections.",

Rhinoviruses are associated with a higher incidence of lower respiratory illness in the elderly, which accounts for higher numbers of clinician visits, activity restrictions, and a significant number of antibiotic prescriptions for this patient population. Hospitalizations for VRIs resulting from rhinovirus may be increased among subjects with moderate to severe COPD. With the increased prevalence of vulnerable, high-risk patients with COPD and the growing population of elderly in society, newer antiviral agents are needed for prophylaxis against common viral respiratory tract infections.",
