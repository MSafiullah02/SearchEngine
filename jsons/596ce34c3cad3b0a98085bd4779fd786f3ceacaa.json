At 72-96 h after infection, the plates were scored for cytopathic effect, and the TCID 50 virus titers were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench [12] . RNA was isolated, and viral copy numbers were quantified using real-time reverse-tran-scription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

RNA was isolated from nasal washes and swabs, by use of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), and from tissues, by use of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The H1N1 virus was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR performed using the LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes (Roche) assay targeting the HA gene (nucleotide position 714-815; GenBank accession number GQ160606).

HAI antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibits hemagglutination of turkey red blood cells. On day 10 after vaccination, heparinized blood was collected for proliferation assays. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll-hypaque (GE Healthcare) gradient purification and cultivated in the presence of overlapping peptide pools covering the nucleocapsid (NP), neuraminidase (NA), and HA proteins of the related H1N1 strain A/Brevig Mission/1918. The proliferation response was measured by adding 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to the peptide-exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 72 h. The next day, cells were fixed, and BrdU incorporation was quantified by immunostaining performed using a chemoluminescent substrate (Roche). The proliferation index is expressed as the ratio of BrdU incorporation measured for the respective influenza peptide pool and for an Ebola virus peptide as negative control.

HAI antibody titers against the pandemic H1N1 2009 MX10 isolate were detected at day 7 in ferrets receiving the laboratory-produced matched vaccine pH1N1inact or the swine influenza vaccine FluSure, reaching titers 140 on day 7 or 10, respectively. FluSure or pH1N1inact did not generate detectable HAI antibody titers against the seasonal H1N1 strain A/Brisbane/59/2007 included in conventional seasonal influenza vaccines, such as Fluviral or FluMist. In contrast, between day 7 and day 10, both seasonal vaccines elicited HAI antibody titers against A/Brisbane/59/2007 that were 140, whereas no cross-reactive response to MX10 was detected before challenge ( Figure 1B) . None of the vaccines elicited an IFN-g enzyme-linked immunospot response upon stimulation with overlapping peptides covering the NP, NA, and HA proteins of H1N1 strain A/Brevig Mission/1918. These proteins share 94%, 87%, and 86% amino acid identity with the respective MX10 proteins, which may have contributed to the weak response observed. However, increased proliferation activity in response to NP peptide pools was detected in animals immunized with FluMist, indicating a cross-reactive T cell response ( Figure 1C) .",

In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in recorded clinical signs of disease, weight loss, or survival rate between the animals given Fluviral and the control groups, over the course of the experiment after challenge ( ). The group of ferrets vac-P 1 .05 cinated with FluMist showed a slight improvement in average body weight at days 5 and 6 after challenge. However, weight loss increased from day 6 to day 9, at which point clinical signs of disease, including nasal seromucous exudates, shallow and labored breathing, and reduced activity forced euthanasia for 4 of the 5 animals given FluMist, resulting in a small increase in the mortality rate, compared with that noted for the un- vaccinated control group. This increase in the mortality rate associated with mismatched FluMist immunization was also observed in a second experiment with 4 animals, although the increase was not statistically significant (data not shown).",

A possible intervention strategy to mitigate the 2009 fall influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere was to initially perform mass immunization with the seasonal vaccine, followed by mass immunization with the fully matched pandemic H1N1 2009 vaccine as soon as would become available. To direct a concerted public health response to control the spread of the virus, the efficacy of a newly produced matched inactivated vaccine, as well as that of already available inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, has to be assessed. Toward this end, we compared the antibody and cellular responses elicited by 2 seasonal vaccines (Fluviral and FluMist), the commercial swine vaccine FluSure, and a laboratory-produced matched inactivated whole-virus preparation. We found that only the swine and matched vaccines resulted in production of HAI antibodies against the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, whereas only FluMist triggered a crossreactive cellular response. Intranasal challenge with the virulent Mexican isolate MX10, similar to MX/4482, which also leads to a 50% mortality rate among naive animals [6] , revealed that none of the vaccines was able to confer complete protection after only one immunization. However, FluSure was associated with the best reduction in morbidity and complete protection from mortality, whereas the matched inactivated vaccine resulted in moderate clinical improvement and reduced mortality. As was expected from undetectable HAI antibody titers, animals vaccinated with Fluviral or FluMist did not experience a beneficial effect, compared with unvaccinated control animals.",

The use of a more virulent challenge strain enables assessment of vaccine efficacy in a worst-case scenario. However, the disease severity associated with currently circulating pandemic H1N1 2009 strains in most patients is more similar to that associated with seasonal influenza [3] . It is thus possible that a single 15-mg dose of a matched inactivated vaccine will be sufficient to confer protection against most pandemic H1N1 2009 strains, especially in individuals with some levels of cross-protection due to previous influenza infection. The efficiency of a commercially available swine vaccine indicates that this product would be adequate to protect animals, including pig herds, which could minimize interspecies transmission and maybe limit evolution of the virus. The FluSure vaccine consists of an inactivated H1N1 and H3N2 type A field isolate formulated with Amphigen (Pfizer) as an adjuvant [15] , indicating that the use of this and other adjuvants merits a more in-depth evaluation in the context of the development of improved human influenza vaccines.",

On the other hand, data from this study also indicate that weight loss was, on average, more severe for the unvaccinated control animals than for any other vaccinated group of animals. The present study was designed to evaluate protective efficacy after vaccination and not the possible subtle negative effects caused by immunization with mismatched influenza antigens. Larger study group sizes will be necessary to conclusively address this question with an appropriate degree of statistical confidence. Antibody-mediated enhancement of influenza infection, including subtype-crossreactive, nonneutralizing antibodies, has been previously described in cultured cells [18] [19] [20] . This mechanism has never been directly associated with a worsened clinical condition in animal models of influenza infection, although a recent study reported that maternally derived antibodies possibly enhanced swine influenza virus-induced pneumonia in pigs [21] . These observations further support the need for a more detailed evaluation of the efficacy of influenza vaccine in controlled exper-imental conditions where various levels of preexisting immunity to mismatched influenza antigens could be studied.",

However, this response was not sufficient to control the disease. In fact, the strong expression of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, detected in that group on day 3 may have suppressed an appropriate inflammatory response, including IL-6 expression, and temporarily favored virus replication, as previously demonstrated in pigs infected with foot-and-mouth disease [22] . There are reports showing the negative effect of IL-10 on influenza virus-infected mice and pigs [23, 24] , and increased IL-10 production correlated with a low antibody response in elderly individuals after influenza vaccination [25] .
