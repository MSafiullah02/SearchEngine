In a previous study, the efficacy of parenteral toltrazuril (45 mg/piglet, Group Forceris \u00ae ) applied on the 2nd day of life (dol), and of oral toltrazuril (20 mg/kg of body weight, Group Baycox \u00ae ) applied on the 4th dol was evaluated in an experimental model with Cystoisospora suis infection on the 3rd dol (late infection, LI). In a follow-up study, efficacy and safety were evaluated against infections with C. suis on the 1st dol (early infection, EI). Parameters included oocyst excretion and faecal consistency, body weight development, bacteriological examinations and animal health.",

No treatment-related adverse events were noted. Body weight gain was reduced in the control group during the acute phase of infection, resulting in significantly lower body weight on the 15th dol. Sows and piglets shed high numbers of Escherichia coli. Clostridium perfringens type A was only detected in low amounts in pooled litter samples. In comparison to the LI study oocyst shedding was more intense in the control animals in EI, while diarrhea was more frequent in LI. In both infection models a high efficacy of toltrazuril in the control of parasitological and clinical outcomes of experimental C. suis infection could be demonstrated. Since in the LI study high numbers of Cl. perfringens type A were detected, it is hypothesized that colonization with these opportunistic pathogens has synergistic effects with C. suis and may explain variable clinical outcomes in untreated animals as well as the sporadic occurrence of diarrhea in toltrazuril-treated piglets. Conclusions: Parenteral and oral toltrazuril administered on the 2nd or 4th dol is safe and effective against experimental infections with C. suis on the 1st to 3rd dol. The clinical outcome of experimental infections seems influenced by bacterial coinfections.",

Under experimental conditions, oral application on the 3rd to 5th day of life (dol) can efficiently control oocyst excretion, parasite induced diarrhea and the correlated depression in body weight gain (e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] ). In a previous controlled experimental study, we compared oral application of toltrazuril on the 4th dol (combined with parenteral iron application on the 2nd dol for prevention of iron deficiency anemia) to parenteral treatment with a combinatorial product (Forceris \u00ae ; toltrazuril + iron as gleptoferron) on the 2nd dol for the control of experimental C. suis infection on the 3rd dol [4] . Both applications were highly effective in controlling oocyst excretion (with complete suppression of oocyst excretion after application of the combination product), diarrhea and significantly improved weight gain.",

Methods and study design were essentially the same as before [4] except for the day of infection. A total of 38 piglets from three sows were enrolled in the study after initial health examination and randomly allocated to three groups by ascending birth weight and infected with 1000 sporulated oocysts of C. suis (strain Wien-I) each on the 1st dol. The Forceris \u00ae group (n = 13) received a fixed dose of 45 mg of toltrazuril + 200 mg of iron as gleptoferron (1.5 ml; Forceris \u00ae , Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale, Libourne, France) applied intramuscularly (i.m.) on the 2nd dol. The Baycox \u00ae group (n = 13) received a fixed dose of 200 mg of iron as iron dextran (1 ml; Uniferon \u00ae 200, Virbac, Kolding, Denmark) i.m. on the 2nd dol and 20 mg/kg of body weight (BW) of toltrazuril (Baycox \u00ae 5%, Bayer Animal Health, Monheim, Germany) orally on the 4th dol according to the product label. The control group (n = 12) received only iron in the same manner as the Baycox \u00ae group. Piglets were observed for general health from the 1st to the 29th dol (end of study) and for post-treatment effects 1, 6 and 24 h post treatment. Individual faecal samples were obtained daily from the 5th to the 18th dol and body weight was determined after birth (1st dol) and weekly (8th, 15, 22nd and 29th dol) until the end of the study. Faecal samples were evaluated for consistency and scored [faecal score (FS): FS1, firm; FS 2, pasty; FS 3, semi-liquid; FS 4, liquid] and examined for the presence of oocysts by autofluorescence (AF). Positive samples were examined by a modified McMaster technique adapted to small amounts of samples to quantify the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OpG) [15] .",

The high efficacy of parenteral toltrazuril against porcine cystoisosporosis has previously been demonstrated in experimental and field trials [4, 16] . Since we wanted to compare the outcome of parenteral toltrazuril treatment on the 2nd dol against infection with C. suis on the 1st dol versus the 3rd dol, we employed the infection model using the same toltrazuril-sensitive C. suis strain and the same treatment regime as before [4] . Sows for both trials were purchased from the same breeder and had undergone the same vaccination scheme (erysipelas and porcine rotavirus vaccination, no immunization against E. coli or Cl. perfringens). Early infection on the 1st dol resulted in increased oocyst excretion in the control group both in terms of the duration and excretion intensity. This is in line with previous reports about the rapidly evolving age resistance against C. suis in piglets [11] [12] [13] . However, despite the strongly increased oocyst output, the parameters related to diarrhoea were comparable in both trials; for some even a slight increase in the animals infected later was seen. Apart from the infection time point, there was also a noticeable difference between the two trials with regard to bacterial co-infections. The quantity of E. coli and Cl. perfringens shed by the piglets four days after infection was much lower in the present study than in the previous one, where haemolytic E. coli expressing a set of four different virulence factors and beta 2 toxin-positive Cl. perfringens type A were abundant. After treatment, only low numbers of E. coli could be detected in the treated piglets with early infection, while in the previous study both E. coli and Cl. perfringens were abundant in treated diarrhoeic piglets.",

            "text": "Effective control of coccidial infections generally requires early intervention to limit tissue damage and environmental contamination with oocysts. Oral toltrazuril application in the first week of life to suckling piglets at risk of infection with C. suis shortly after birth can effectively prevent oocyst excretion and infection-related diarrhoea [1] [2] [3] [4] . Metaphylactic treatment is usually conducted three to five days after birth as per product label [17] ; however, in cases of high infection pressure with infections directly after birth it is advisable to treat as early as the 1st dol, since even in the prepatent period of parasite multiplication tissue damage can be considerable. This may be especially the case in the presence of enteropathogenic bacteria such as Cl. perfringens type A [14] . The mechanisms of interaction between Cl. perfringens and C. suis are not resolved; however, it appears that enteritis caused by coccidial infections promotes intestinal colonisation and (over)growth with Cl. perfringens and induces necrotic enteritis in piglets [14, 18] as well as in chickens [19] . Experimental studies in chickens have shown that infections with coccidia promote the growth of mucolytic bacteria, most probably due to the intestinal mucogenic response to parasite infection and leakage of glycoproteins and mannose residues from intestinal cells which promote the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria and together with other pro-inflammatory responses, result in necrotic enteritis (reviewed in [20] ). An association of Cl. perfringens with eimeriosis in the pathogenesis of enteritis in cattle has also been described [21] . Interactions between Cl. perfringens and C. suis are supported by field observations [22] and therefore early treatment against C. suis on the day after birth is advisable in cases where neonatal infections are to be expected. Early toltrazuril treatment has also been suggested for prevention of coccidiosis necrotic enteritis in chickens [23] .",

From our data we also conclude that treatment of piglets infected with C. suis can reduce the pathogenic effects of the detected bacteria, as diarrhoea was highly and significantly reduced in toltrazuril-treated piglets in relation to the controls as shown in previous trials. Since the two different infection time points were investigated using different litters to avoid accidental cross-infections, no conclusions can be made as to whether this had any effect on the outcome of the parasite-bacteria interactions. Further studies on the interactions between C. suis and the gut microbiota in the suckling period are necessary to elucidate its underlying mechanisms in suckling piglets.",
