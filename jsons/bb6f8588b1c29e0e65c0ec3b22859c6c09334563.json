Bangladesh is beset with widespread corruption and extreme politicization alongside other issues such as money laundering which seriously hamper smooth governance and economic growth (Daily Star 2020b; Khan and Islam 2015) . Consequently, the country has substantial income inequality throughout (Mazid 2019) . The country is developing day by day although the wealth distribution is imbalanced. Therefore, a significant minority of individuals live below the poverty line (i.e., 20% live below the poverty line and 10.5% live in extreme poverty as reported in the 2018-2019 economic year; Financial Express 2019). Additionally, (i) the country is also ranked as having the second most unemployed graduates among Asia-Pacific countries, based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) report (Daily Jugantor 2019); (ii) youth unemployment rates doubled between 2010 and 2017 (Daily Jugantor 2019); (iii) the country has an unemployment rate of 4.4% among the general population (Daily Jugantor 2019); and (iv) 70% of the people in Bangladesh live from hand-to-mouth (Kamruzzaman 2020). However, a recent report showed extreme economic fallout due to COVID-19 crisis among poor Bangladeshi people. More specifically, per capita income dropped by 82% to $0.32 (US) in early April from $1.30 in February among individuals who live in slums compared to a 79% reduction among rural poor people (i.e., $0.39 down from $1.05; Kamruzzaman 2020).",

This has led to rising food costs making it difficult for unprivileged individuals to survive. Although the government is trying to support these people and combat the situation by the introduction of financial aid (Daily Bangladesh 2020), corruption and mismanagement have occurred during the distribution of relief goods (e.g., food, sanitary goods, household items, medicines that are required for the everyday life) and individuals have not been getting basic things they need. There have been serious allegations reported in the Bangladeshi press media (Daily Star 2020b) including the stealing and retention of relief goods by local government representatives instead of supplying it to individuals most in need. Consequently, the sudden economic recession has led needy individuals to contemplate suicide. Globally, it is well-established that unemployment, poverty, and economic distress are associated with suicide, and that when there are increases in these, there are increases in suicide (Goldman-Mellor et al. 2010; Oyesanya et al. 2015) . Therefore, the suicide-related cases that are reported here are not unexpected in the COVID-19 lockdown situation because of the economic instability and disruption throughout the country.",

The situation is also getting worse day by day. For instance, at the time of writing, 78,000 garment workers have protested because their wages have not been paid. (RisingBD 2020b). Additionally, the country is also losing foreign money from garment and leather product exportation, and is losing investment in large-scale projects from host countries like China (Banna 2020) .
