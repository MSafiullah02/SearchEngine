Traffic accidents contribute to the worldwide deaths in a significant way also leading to moderate as well as serious injuries requiring hospitalization [3]. Even if the introduction of seat belts and the improvement of safety systems led to a significant reduction of injury severity and death after traffic accidence, they are still one of the major causes for maxillofacial injuries in adults [2, 4]. Those injuries may result in a loss of function, disfiguration, psychological problems or even disability and death [5]. The assessment of facial injuries is often perceived as difficult by the ambulance. In particular, this is due to the fact that injuries in the maxillofacial area offer special features and that there is often a lack of subject-specific competence [6]. Nevertheless, Esmer et al. found evidence that about 25% of all severely injured patients are suffering from maxillofacial injuries as well [7]. These injuries can be less severe, such as injuries to soft tissue or teeth, or life-threatening, such as bleedings from major arteries [8].",

Therefore, the aims of this study on a large cohort of affected patients were to describe the patterns of the respective injuries and to identify those factors associated with road traffic accidents. As secondary parameter, changes within the patterns of injury within a 20-year period were examined.",

Patients from hospitals other than Germany were excluded due to their potentially other emergency medical services (EMS) systems. Patients who did not undergo immediate surgery or were not admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) were also excluded. Revised Injury Severity Classification II (RISC II) scores were calculated in order to predict mortality and thus to assess the probability of survival at the time of hospital admission [13].

A further limitation of the study is the absence of details of maxillofacial injuries. Even documentation and especially coding has shown to be not reliable [43] and it can be assumed that this especially applies for maxillofacial injuries if they are primarily documented and coded by trauma surgeons. Moreover, it should be stressed that all data are limited to severely injured patients who arrived alive the emergency department and were treated by a multidisciplinary trauma team.",
