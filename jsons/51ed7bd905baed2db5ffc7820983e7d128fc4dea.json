We first build a model (i.e., a combinatorial optimization problem) that captures the current setting: the risk of the people to get COVID-19, the contact between various people and the cost of closing various facilities such as schools, parks, cities, factories, etc.. We show that the problem we introduce is NP-hard (as it is often the case with complex combinatorial optimization problems). Then, since we cannot solve the problem exactly in polynomial time, we provide a heuristic polynomial time algorithm for this problem. To understand the performance of our algorithm, we implement and test it in Section 5. We generate our test data using special probability distributions that simulate real world social networks as we present in Section 5.1. Our experiments are encouraging and show that even with a 1% budget (from the total cost of locking down the entire country), we can reduce the population risk by more than 5 times compared with the situation in which no measures are taken. Thus, we show that there is a possibility for a \"beautiful\" lockdown that is efficient in the fight with COVID-19 and safe for the economy.",

The Subset Sum problem is a famous NP-hard problem [2] . Given an instance of the Subset Sum problem, we create an instance of Problem 7 as follows. For each number x in the set S, we create a facility v of cost c(v) = x. Each facility v has precisely one edge (u, v) \u2208 E, with f (u) = c(v)/max v\u2208V c(V ) and p(u, v) = 1.
