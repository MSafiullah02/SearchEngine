Such devices could control and modulate the electrochemical signal due to the redox property of metalloprotein in order to achieve the store and release the electron by external potential. Usually, the bioelectronic devices were classified with six categories (Fig. 17.4 ). This article briefly introduced devise ranging from the basic concept of a biomolecular memory device to the various function validations of multi-functional biomemory devices and bioprocessors. In previous time, they proposed the bioelectronic device composed of metalloprotein. The purpose of this electronic device was to accomplish electronic functions of the information storage.

The metalloprotein contained the metal ion in the protein molecule that can be enabled to store the electron corresponding to input potentials. To fabricate the biomemory device, the immobilization and orientation of biomolecule technique should be required. To immobilize the biomolecule onto the inorganic substrate, a self-assembly (SA) method has been widely used to immobilize biomolecules on the substrate (Mitsumasa et al. 2010) . The immobilization of biomolecules on the substrate needs an additional linker which anchors between the biomolecule and the substrate. Chemical linkers like (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), 2-mercaptoacetic acid (2-MAA) 6-mercaptohexanoic acids (6-MHA) can be used to make connections between the gold substrate and the biomolecule Robles-\u00c1guila et al. 2014; Yoo et al. 2011 ). However, direct immobilization of biomolecules on the substrate without chemical linkers is more effective for the fabricating a well-ordered biomolecular monolayer than the use of chemical linkers. To achieve direct immobilization, a cysteine-modified azurin was introduced as an electron storage element to fabricate a biomolecular memory device. On the basis of this technique, pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin was modified to possess cysteine residue for direct immobilization on the gold surface by covalent bonding. This recombinant azurin was immobilized directly on the gold substrate, and its orientation was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

The quantity of the stored charge can be calculated as the memory performance of the fabricated biomolecular memory device using chronoamperometry (CA). Also, the recombinant azurin showed unique redox potential peaks and memory functions. From experimental results, this proposed biomemory device indicates new conceptual approach to bioelectronic application.

The first advantage is that biomolecules can offer the possibility of homogeneous system fabrication to develop the uniform threedimensional logic system compared to two-dimensional solid-state device which is widely used (Gdor et al. 2013 ). Thus, biomolecules-based system can provide the integration of complex reacting process for the development of high-order logic gate (Katz 2015) .

The electrochemical detection method was EIS that is based on the semicircular diameter of the Nyquist plot from which the higher frequencies explains the higher charge transfer resistance (R et ) corresponding to the more negative charge of the electrodes resulting from the layer-by-layer assembly of the electrode surface with oligonucleotides. The HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH \u00bc 7.2) was used which contained Fe(CN) 6 3\u00c0/4\u00c0 as the negatively charged redox probe to indicate the electrode surface modification based on its repulsion from the surface, associated with the sequential addition of oligonucleotides (negative charge) to the surface. For a fixed incubation Fig. 17.19 General diagram for the labeled and label-free electrochemical nucleic acid biosensor; DPV and SWV stand for differential phase voltammetry and square wave voltammetry, respectively time of 45 min, different concentration of the analyte (2) was added to the biosensor to achieve the dynamic detection range.
