            "text": "The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses that are widespread in nature, infecting birds as well as land, sea and flying mammals, causing humans gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases of varying severity. The \u223c30 kb CoV RNA genomes are all distinguished by conserved gene organizations. The CoVs encode well-described proteins required for virus entry, replication and assembly, and also encode more enigmatic small proteins of unknown function that are specific to one of the three CoV antigenic groups (Stadler et al., 2003). Reverse genetic engineering methods have been used to ablate one or more of these smaller group-specific genes, and in general, these engineered manipulations have had little effect on in vitro CoV viabilities (Yount et al., 2005). These fundamental observations make it clear that CoVs encode \u201caccessory\u201d proteins that are unnecessary for virus amplification in cell culture but are presumably operating in more complex in vivo environments to maintain these viruses in nature. Experiments to discern CoV accessory protein structure and function may contribute generally to CoV virulence and zoonotic potential, and their genetically engineered modification may be required to construct useful CoV vectors and attenuated CoV vaccines.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is the prototypic human pathogenic CoV. SARS-CoV is also the most complex known CoV with respect to accessory proteins, with eight accessory genes interspersed between those encoding virion structural components (Hussain et al., 2005, Rota et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). These accessory genes are present in SARS-CoVs isolated from bats, civet cats, raccoon dogs, and humans, suggesting important accessory functions in a variety of host environments (Li et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005). There is clear evidence that these accessory genes are expressed (Chen et al., 2007, Keng et al., 2006, Lu et al., 2006, Nelson et al., 2005, Pewe et al., 2005, Schaecher et al., 2007a, Schaecher et al., 2007b, Tan et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2006, Yuan et al., 2005) but their functions remain somewhat obscure. Currently there are a range of suggested and indicated activities for accessory proteins, including viral structural elements, ion channels, cell death inducers and interferon antagonists (Chen et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2007, Hussain et al., 2008, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2006, Schaecher et al., 2007a, Schaecher et al., 2007b, Tan et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Of all the CoV accessory proteins currently under investigation, the SARS-CoV protein 6 is arguably the best understood with respect to its structure and function. This intriguing 63 amino acid peptide is amphipathic in its amino-terminal \u223c44 residues and very polar in the \u223c20 residues comprising its C-terminus. Protein 6 is found entirely on cytoplasmic membranes (Geng et al., 2005), localizing on ER and Golgi organelles. Its membrane topology is N-endo C-endo, with a membrane-embedded stretch that is likely \u223c6 nm of alpha-helical structure (Netland et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2010). With respect to function, protein 6 is a virulence factor, converting a sub-lethal infection of heterologous murine coronavirus into a lethal infection and conferring growth advantages to murine coronavirus and also to SARS-CoV in infected host mice and cultured cells (Netland et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2009). The way that protein 6 supports these CoV infections may be two-fold. The N-terminal lipophilic portion, presumably by remodeling intracellular membrane architectures, supports more robust CoV RNA replication (Pewe et al., 2005, Tangudu et al., 2007). The C-terminal polar portion, by interfering with protein import into the nucleus, detains transport of signaling proteins needed for innate immune responses (Frieman et al., 2007, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). The way that protein 6 interacts with nuclear import factors appears to be similar to that of a classical NLS-containing protein, however, motifs and domains involved in the communication between protein 6 and nuclear import machineries are not fully characterized.",

These protein complexes are restricted to cytoplasmic membranes via the hydrophobic N-terminus of protein 6, which limits capacities of KPNA2 and KPNB1 to escort proteins from the cytoplasm to nuclei (Moroianu et al., 1995). KPNA2 typically binds and directs the transport of proteins containing the \u201cclassical\u201d nuclear localization signal (cNLS) (Moroianu et al., 1995), which is lacking in protein 6. Protein 6 does, however, contain a cluster of four basic residues at its C-terminus, which weakly resembles a bipartite NLS (Kalderon et al., 1984). To assess whether this putative NLS is necessary for p6 to impede protein import into nuclei, we replaced basic residues (RKKK) to alanine by PCR based mutagenesis (Fig. 1\n). If these basic residues are part of a KPNA2-interacting NLS motif, then their replacement with alanines would eliminate p6-mediated interference with nuclear protein import. Co-expression of mutant p6RKKK-ala with a cNLS bearing reporter (3XGFP-NLS) revealed that the mutant protein lacking basic residues was as potent as native p6 in blocking nuclear import of the cNLS reporter (Fig. 1 and Table 1\n). These data indicate that the potential bipartite NLS located at protein C-terminus does not play a role in preventing nuclear import. Interaction between protein 6 and import factors may therefore depend on protein conformation or may be mediated by an unknown NLS-containing adaptor protein.",

The 84 kDa 3XGFP protein exceeds the passive diffusion limit of the nuclear pore complex and remains in the cytoplasm unless appended with a NLS, which we presumed, might be supplied by p6. 293 cells were transiently transfected with 3XGFP-p6 plasmids and expressed proteins were visualized by western blotting and by fluorescent microscopy.

The putative p6 NLS was inert in the context of these 3XGFP.

Contrary to NS5A-p6 proteins, E-p6 proteins did not interfere with the nuclear accumulation of a cNLS-containing reporter protein (Fig. 3B). The lack of interference by E-p6 constructs could be due to a number of factors. The N-terminal hydrophobic region or E-p6 is structurally different from the N-terminal amphipathic region of wild type p6 or NS5A-p6. The intracellular localization of NS5A, protein 6 and E proteins are believed to be dictated by the N-terminal hydrophobic regions of each protein. Tethering the C-terminal tail of p6 to the E protein N-terminal hydrophobic region could potentially alter both subcellular location and conformation, which could have affected its interaction with nuclear import factors. We have attempted to distinguish among these two possibilities but we were not successful in targeting identical p6 C-termini to different organelles and thus the importance of subcellular location remains unknown.",

It is therefore possible that particular N-terminal sequences are necessary to embed the proteins into the appropriate intracellular membrane environments and provide protection from proteolysis.

Most of these studies were performed using mutant protein 6, either lacking a part of the N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helical motif or having individual residue substitutions in the alpha-helical region. Replacement of the p6 amphipathic alpha-helical motif with one from NS5A did not compromise nuclear import impedance, and therefore prompted us to investigate the importance of this replacement in the separate virus accelerating function. The NS5A-p624\u201363 and full-length protein 6 have identical carboxy-termini and structurally similar amino-termini of different amino acid compositions. Both proteins are potent nuclear import inhibitors, an activity assigned to the carboxy-terminus in previous studies and further elaborated in this report. To determine if chimeric NS5A-p624\u201363 protein could also affect coronavirus infection, 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either full-length p6 or NS5A-p624\u201363, then infected one day later with MHV (strain rJ.2.2; moi 0.2). After an 18 h infection cycle, viral products were identified in cell lysates and in culture media by western blotting and by plaque assay. Contrary to the nuclear import assay, where protein 6 and chimeric protein NS5A-p624\u201363 efficiently interfered with nuclear import, only p6 was capable of accelerating MHV infection (Fig. 4\n). We also have infected cells harboring E-p6 (24\u201363, 35\u201363 and 45\u201363); none of these chimeric proteins had any effects on MHV infection progression or viral titers (data not shown).

These findings support our hypothesis of a conformation-dependent NLS. Many viral and cellular proteins utilize conformation-dependent nuclear localization signals to shuttle in and out of the nucleus. Bovine Herpesvirus 1 Tegument Protein VP22 accumulates in the nucleus of infected cells but does not contain a classical sequential NLS. A relatively long 103 amino acid sequence is required for nuclear localization (Zhu et al., 2005). The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein UL84 (pUL84) utilizes the importin-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway but does not contain a classical importin-\u03b1 binding motif, rather a large domain of \u223c282 residues is necessary for nuclear localization (Lischka et al., 2003). Several cellular nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins also lack well defined nuclear localization or nuclear export signals. The tumour suppressor PTEN lacks obvious canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences or nuclear export sequences (NES) that could account for its targeting (Gil et al., 2007). The latent transcription factor STAT1 which is activated in response to IFN-\u03b3 and translocated into the nucleus does not contain a classical NLS as defined by the basic amino acid cluster. Rather, interaction with nuclear import machinery is unconventional, dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and homodimerization (Sekimoto et al., 1997). Thus a conformation-dependent motif facilitating cytoplasmic \u2013 nuclear protein transport is often apparent. An interesting feature of the SARS-coronavirus protein 6 is that it presents such a motif to impede general nuclear import.",
