While along with the understanding of spatial epidemics on meta-population networks achieved so far, more challenges have opened the door to identify, retrospect, and predict the epidemic invasion process. This chapter reviews the recent progress towards identifying susceptible-infected compartment parameters and spatial invasion pathways on a meta-population network as well as the minimal case of two-subpopulation version, which may also extend to the prediction of spatial epidemics as well. The artificial and empirical meta-population networks verify the effectiveness of our proposed solutions to the concerned problems.

Typically, from the viewpoint of system and control, the precise mathematic description and appropriate models of a complex network play a significant role to achieve the desirable performance in return.

We also compute the accuracy of accumulative INCs of mI 7 ! S and mI 7 ! nS, which is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly identified invasion pathways by each method to the number of true invasion pathways in this INC. Besides, we also make the comparison of the identification accuracy at the early stage of epidemic dynamics, which is defined as the period when the first 50 subpopulation have been infected. In the top and middle panels of Fig. 6 .8, we observe the whole identification accuracy and the early-stage identification accuracy, while the bottom panel of Fig. 6 .8 presents the early and whole accumulative identification accuracy of mI 7 ! S and mI 7 ! nS through 20 independent realizations on the AAN, respectively. Here the whole identification accuracy means the identification accuracy of whole meta-population network has been infected. The seed subpopulation in all such independent realizations is set as the Sun Valley Airport in Bullhead City, Arizona. We clearly observe that the IPI algorithm is more accurate at identifying the invasion pathways than other benchmark methods. We then visualize the identified invasion pathways (the lower panel of Fig. 6 .9) during the early stage of a realization compared with the actual invasion pathways (the upper panel of Fig. 6.9 ). The weights (diffusion rates) of invasion edges are shown by the thicknesses of lines, and arrows represent the directions of invasions. We observe that most of the invasion pathways are correctly identified to form the invasive backbone of this realization of an epidemic dynamics, while there still exist some wrongly identified pathways in some INCs, indicating the necessity of defining the identifiability of an INC. We finally examine the identifiability of an invasion case. Figure 6 .10 shows the entropy and identifiability of wrongly identified mI 7 ! S of 20 independent realizations on the AAN. The smaller the identifiability of an invasion case is, the more prone it is to be wrongly identified. The identifiability depicts the wrongly identified mI 7 ! S more reasonably than the likelihoods entropy. The frequency of identifiability of INCs descends obviously, but that of the likelihood entropy of INCs does not clearly ascend. This statistical result indicates that the identifiability \u2026 has a better performance to distinguish whether an invasion case is difficult to identify or not than the distinction performance of the likelihood entropy, and also tells that why some invasion cases are easy to identify, whose \u2026 are more than 0.5, and why some invasion cases are difficult to identify, whose \u2026 are much less than 0.5. Here 0.5 is an empirical value.",
