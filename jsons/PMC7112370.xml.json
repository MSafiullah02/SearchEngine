            "text": "Baphicacanthis Cusiae Rhizoma et Radix (short as Baphicacanthis Cusiae) belongs to the family Acanthaceae, is a traditional Chinese medicine produced from the dry rhizomes and roots of Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek. It is recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [1], and has mainly been used for the treatment of pestilence, fever, sore throat, etc\n[2]. Also, its potential in the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been discovered in some studies since 2003 [3], then it became more widely used in China. Current researches have showed that Baphicacanthis Cusiae has antiviral, anticancer, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, and the function for liver protection [4]. Its antiviral activity might be related to the components of indigo, tryptanthrin or indirubin [5], but there is no direct evidence to support other activities due to these experiments were based on water extract as the experimental material. It has reported that the water extract of Baphicacanthis Cusiae is rich in water-soluble polysaccharides, and the polysaccharide has antibacterial activity [6]. However, there was little report devoted to thoroughly studying the characterization, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of purified polysaccharide from Baphicacanthis Cusiae (BCP). Therefore, this study was aimed to update the data and discover potential bioactivities of purified BCP.",

A water bath was used to monitor the temperature of extraction process (501-A, Shanghai Instrument Co., Ltd.). After treatment, the mixture extract was centrifuged (4000 r/min, 20 min). Insoluble residue was re-extracted to recover the residual water-soluble polysaccharides. The supernatants were collected, concentrated and then mixed with four-fold amount of absolute ethanol. The mixture was stirred vigorously and then kept overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (5000 r/min, 20 min) and freeze drying to get crude BCP.",

The results showed that BCP-2 had the relatively higher contents of sulfuric radical and uronic acid.

Furthermore, BCP-1 and BCP-2 exhibited strong superoxide radical scavenging activity, reductive potential and ferrous ion chelating activity. For anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, BCP-1 and BCP-2 could exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the secretion of NO and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages. For anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, BCP-1 and BCP-2 could significantly inhibit mice ear edema induced by xylene, and vascular permeability increase induced by intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid.
