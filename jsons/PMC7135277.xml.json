Mechanism of action of these drugs is not well understood, but it is believed that they likely act as membrane fusion inhibitors and as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors [2], [3]. Amantadine is excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas rimantadine is metabolized in the liver. The main described side effects are central nervous system based, including insomnia, impaired thinking, and confusion [4]. Information in pregnancy is limited, but amantadine has shown teratogenic and embryotoxic effects when given in high doses to rats. No adequate human studies have been conducted. Infants exposed to amantadine in pregnancy have had cardiovascular abnormalities. It is listed as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category C drug [5], [6].",

            "text": "Neuraminidase inhibitors are active against both influenzae A and B. Their mechanism of action involves a crucial step in the life cycle of influenzae A and B. A viral surface glycoprotein (hemagglutinin) binds to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial surface glycoproteins, which is necessary for the initiation of infection. After the virus replicates, it is also attached to the host cell the same way until neuraminidase cleaves this link and frees the new virions. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are sialic acid analogs that competitively inhibit the viral neuraminidase [7], [8]. Zanamivir is inhaled as a dry powder (2 \u00d7 5 mg inhalations twice daily for 5 days) and oseltamivir is an oral drug given as 75 mg orally twice a day for 5 days. The major side effects are nausea and vomiting, but there has been some concern with respiratory distress associated with zanamivir [9], [10]. There are limited pregnancy data, with animal studies showing minor skeletal alterations in rats when pregnant rats are given zanamivir, and there are similar findings in pregnant rabbits given oseltamivir. These drugs are FDA category C, because there are no human data [11], [12]. Given the relatively limited indications, it may be prudent to avoid these drugs in pregnancy.",

The mechanism of action results in mammalian non\u2013herpes virus-infected cells being spared the effects of the drug [14]. Acyclovir is active against herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. It is effective in vitro against CMV [15]. The usual oral dosage ranges from 200 mg five times per day for herpes simplex virus infections to 800 mg five times per day for varicella zoster infections [16]. Of note, the bioavailability of oral acyclovir is only 20%, which has led to the development of other compounds, including valacyclovir and famciclovir, designed to achieve better dosing regimens [16].",

Treatment of severe varicella infection is often warranted for maternal symptom relief [20]. The use of acyclovir near term to suppress recurrence of genital herpes also has been evaluated and is currently considered a clinical option to decrease neonatal exposure to virus at delivery and increase the likelihood of a vaginal delivery [21], [22], [23], [24]. Acyclovir, 400 mg three times a day, from 36 weeks' gestation to delivery has been shown by pharmacokinetic studies in pregnancy to be required to achieve suppression in pregnancy [25]. The manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline) has closed its acyclovir and valacyclovir pregnancy registries. A total of 1129 cases of acyclovir exposure in pregnancy\u2014with 712 in the first trimester\u2014were detailed, with no increased risk of congenital defects reported [26]. Acyclovir is found in breast milk at levels approximating those in maternal plasma [27]. Of note, neonatal treatment with acyclovir is relatively commonplace in infants with suspected herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection [28]. Although acyclovir seems to be relatively safe in neonates, caution regarding use in an infant who is dehydrated is warranted because of renal clearance of the drug [14].",

Ganciclovir is used primarily as an intravenous formulation, because oral bioavailability is poor (6%) [33]. Few data exist regarding safety in pregnancy. Animal data suggest embryotoxicity in mice and rabbits [34], [35]; however, limited data in human exposure in a transplant patient showed no adverse effects [36]. It seems that the drug can cross the human placenta, so the possibility of toxicity exists [37]. Late pregnancy data are not available, but neonatal studies of the use of ganciclovir in CMV-infected infants are proceeding that will provide helpful data. Currently, the main toxicity seen in these studies is bone marrow suppression, which seems to be reversible. Of importance, early data suggest an improvement or stabilization of hearing loss in CMV-infected infants [38].",

Interferon-alpha is produced by fetal tissues and may play a role in pregnancy maintenance [46]. Interferons have been used in many situations for treatment of neoplasms, chronic hepatitis C, and other immunopathic diseases. Of note, a new form of interferon, PEG interferon, is a modified form in which polyethylene glycol is covalently bound to the compound to slow its inactivation and excretion. Currently, PEG interferon and ribavirin are front-line therapy for hepatitis C, and although reproductive-age women are instructed to prevent pregnancy while on the therapy, inadvertent pregnancies occur [40], [41], [47], [48]. General toxicity from the interferons includes pyrexia, leukopenia, hypotension, fatigue, and anorexia. Depression can be a significant side effect in some people [49], [50]. Interferon is a large molecule, and limited studies suggest that it is likely unable to cross the placenta [51]. Animal data regarding use of interferon gamma-1b in monkeys at 100 times the human dose suggest that it acts as an abortifacient [50]. A few case reports exist regarding successful pregnancies in women who have been treated with interferon for chronic myeloid leukemia and hepatitis C through pregnancy [47], [48], [51], [52].",

As of 2002, research determined that 19.2 million women were infected with HIV, which represented 50% of adult persons with the infection [57]. In 2002 alone, there were 2 million new infections in women [57]. Although these demographics are not replicated in western countries, the incidence of HIV infection in women in Canada has increased greatly, with 26% of all new infections in women [58]. Given the magnitude of this disease at the health, social, and economic levels, it becomes even more crucial to understand the impact that therapies can have. Research has established that highly active antiretroviral therapies are capable of increasing the life span of individuals infected with HIV [59], but these are complicated drug regimens with significant short- and long-term toxicities [60], [61]. The use of antiretroviral therapies also has allowed for the dramatic prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in antenatally treated women from a baseline of 25% to less than 1% [62], [63].",

It is also important to consider the possibility of unplanned pregnancy in treatment regimens given to reproductive-age women [64], [65].",

This should not compromise the mother's future ability to take antiretroviral agents. The choice and timing of drug therapy also must be selected to minimize toxicity on the infant. Antiretroviral management in pregnancy has been discussed in other papers, with an excellent up-to-date review that lays out the US approach to this disease [64]. Antiretroviral management is only one component of HIV care in pregnancy. This care must incorporate careful obstetric management, management of any comorbid conditions (eg, anemia, poor nutrition, substance or alcohol use), coexistent medical problems (eg, hepatitis C, diabetes), and proper evaluation of the fetal status. The general management of HIV in pregnancy has been well described in recent reviews [66], [67].",

These drugs are able to bind to the mitochondrial gamma DNA polymerase found in different organ systems, which results in mitochondrial dysfunction [70], [71]. The phenomenon of mitochondrial toxicity varies based on individuals, the particular antiretroviral combination, and the duration of therapy. These clinical effects in adults can include myopathy, myelosuppression, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatic steatosis. Until reliable mitochondrial DNA assays are developed, serum lactate is used as a marker of mitochondrial toxicity. When mitochondrial function is significantly affected, there is a downstream accumulation of lactic acid. Some clinicians and investigators have raised the concern that mitochondrial toxicity may be even more common in pregnant women than in adults on these medications [72]. Some limited data suggest that there may be adverse effects in the neonate because of mitochondrial effects from in utero or neonatal treatment. Lactic academia has been observed in some studies [73], [74], [75], [76], and case reports of fatal lactic acidosis have been made in nucleoside exposed neonates [74].",

One of the main concerns is bone marrow toxicity. In the ACTG 076 study no significant toxicities were noted in the women on zidovudine monotherapy. Macrocytosis usually occurs, and mild anemia is often noted. Nausea, headache, and malaise are common. Zidovudine has favorable pharmacokinetics in pregnancy and was found to be safe in early phase I and II studies [78], [79], [80]. It is actively transported across the placenta and is in an equivalent concentration in the fetus as in the maternal circulation. No congenital anomalies were attributable to zidovudine in the ACTG 076 study or in prior safety studies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Animal studies do show embryo and fetal toxicity. Macaques treated with up to 2.5 times the maximal human dose had increased fetal and neonatal death, with hematologic alterations in the offspring. Pregnant mice given zidovudine showed increased rates of embryonic death but no specific malformation pattern [85]. There have been reports of possible carcinogenicity in zidovudine in animal studies. A National Cancer Institute study showed an increase in liver, lung, and genitourinary tract tumors in offspring of mice given high doses of AZT in the last trimester. A Glaxo-Wellcome study with lower doses (to simulate treatment doses) did not show an increase in tumors. No tumors have been identified in more than 1000 children exposed to AZT in pregnancy who were followed for more than 3 years [86]. Monitoring of maternal and subsequent neonatal blood count is advised.",
