As such, alternative collection methods were rapidly evaluated, including nasal swabs, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, throat washings, and saliva.[[4], [5], [6], [7], [8]] While NP swabs in UTM are the specimen of choice for respiratory virus testing, a recent study demonstrated the feasibility of COVID-19 testing from nasal sample collected with a swab typically used for chlamydia and gonorrhea testing: the Aptima Multitest swab (Hologic, Inc.) and its accompanying specimen transport medium (STM).[9] This study sought to further validate the Aptima swab/STM collection kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a single swab approach to sample the oropharynx and anterior nares (OP/Na).",

Each specimen was stored at 4 \u00b0C until testing, and an aliquot was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Both swabs were in parallel within 12 h of collection using two molecular methods. First, the SARS-CoV-2 assay, was performed on a Cobas 6800 system (Roche Diagnostics). For UTM (NP swab material), 600 \u00b5l was processed directly, as recommended by the manufacturer, whereas for the OP/Na, 200 \u00b5l of STM was diluted into 1 ml of Cobas omni Specimen Diluent prior to use due to the presence of high concentrations of detergents.[9] Second, a Total Nucleic Acid (TNA) extraction on a MagNApure LC 2.0 instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was performed, followed by real-time RT-PCR [i.e. laboratory-developed test (LDT) designed at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) (Vancouver, BC)]. Briefly, TNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5l of specimen (NP or OP/Na), eluted into 50 \u00b5l of elution buffer, and 5 \u00b5l was used as template in a triplex real-time RT-PCR, with primers and probes targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) [10] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as well as those targeting an endogenous internal control, ribonuclease P (RNaseP). Amplification was performed on an Applied BioSystems 7500 Fast system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and threshold cycles (Ct) values were determined by the manufacturer software. Results for each instrument were classified as positive or negative, and specimens yielding discrepant results were subjected to testing using the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid). Each test was compared to a modified reference standard defined as concordant results from at least two methods with different genetic targets. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated from 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each collection (NP or OP/Na swabs) and instrument (LDT and commercial assay) using online software (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php). A Fisher exact test was used to assess differences and P \u2264  0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Of 190 paired NP and OP/Na specimens collected, 154 negative results were obtained and 36 patients tested positive by at least one molecular method (18.9% positivity rate). Regardless of the swab (NP or OP/Na) or methods used (LDT or commercial), the specificity was 100.0% (155/155) [95% CI: 97.7 to 100.0%]. Using the LDT, the sensitivity of NP swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 was 94.4% (34/36) [95% CI: 81.3% to 99.3%] compared to 91.7% (33/36) [95% CI: 77.5 to 98.3%] for the OP/Na swabs. Using the commercial assay, the sensitivity for NP swabs was 100.0% (36/36) [95% CI: 90.3% to 100.0%] compared to 88.9% (32/36) [95% CI: 73.9 to 96.9%] for the OP/Na specimens. While the sensitivity of OP/Na was lower than NP swabs using the LDT or commercial assays, no significant differences were observed (P =  0.679 and 0.115, respectively).",

            "text": "Patients with discrepant NP and OP/Na results are summarized in (Table 1\n). With the exception of patient 4, the other five patients with discrepant NP and OP/Na results had specimens with low viral loads (Table 1). Low viral loads are known to occur in the early and late stages of COVID-19 illness [[4], [5], [6],[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]], and false negative results can arise from differences in analytical sensitivity between methods (Table S1) [20,21], the variability in specimen collection, or factors influencing specimen stability or recovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during specimen transport, storage or processing.[4,13] For example, three different SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected between the various PCR methods used for testing of specimens from patient 1, yet high Ct values were observed for these targets (Table 1). High Ct values are suggestive of low viral loads, and it is known that detection of PCR targets near the limit of detection lacks reproducibility.[20,21] Therefore, low viral loads and differences in analytical sensitivity of the various molecular methods could explain differences in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the NP and OP/Na collections (Table S1). Similar arguments could be made for patients 2 to 4, who were either asymptomatic or in the pre-symptomatic stage of infection where low viral loads can occur.[[4], [5], [6],[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]] Discrepant results for patients 5 and 6 were in the setting of known positive cases, with symptoms predating their sample collection by 14 and 18 days, respectively. Waning viral loads over time in the upper respiratory tract are well documented for SARS-CoV-2; however, discrepant NP and OP/Na results from sampling in the later stages of illness may be of little clinical significance, as detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not imply infectivity.[4,6,11,19] Further analyses are underway to correlate SARS-CoV-2 detection, and better understand viral shedding from various anatomical sites in patients stratified by disease onset, clinical presentation, and outcomes.",
