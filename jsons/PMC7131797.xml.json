Complexity has emerged during the past 5 years as a potentially integrating theme in contemporary social science (Byrne, 1998; Urry, 2003). Urry (2003, p. 12) observes that complexity is \u2018a potential new paradigm for the social sciences, having transformed much of the physical and biological sciences\u2019. He sees it as a means of dissolving some of the binary divides (whether quantitative/qualitative, environmental/social, structure/agency, or medical/sociocultural) within the academy. He even suggests that complexity might help break down divisions between the social and the natural sciences (Urry, 2003, pp. 12\u201313, p. 17).",

I conclude with an assessment of some of the missing elements in CT and suggest that while we should welcome any engagement with theory in health geography, we also need sound empirical work to set alongside this.",

The relationship of this to complexity is well-expressed by Barab\u00e1si (2002, p. 7): \u2018Most events and phenomena are connected, caused by, and interacting with a huge number of other pieces of a complex universal puzzle. We have come to see that we live in a small world, where everything is linked to everything else. We are witnessing a revolution in the making as scientists from all disciplines discover that complexity has a strict architecture. We have come to grasp the importance of networks\u2019 (my italics). Both Watts (1999) and Barab\u00e1si (2002) document the apparently complex structure and organisation of networks of various kinds, including the social networks that link complete strangers anywhere in the world by about six intermediaries. This is the so-called \u2018small-world\u2019 problem first developed in detail in the late 1960s by the social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Buchanan (2002, p. 127) considers that \u2018the small-world discovery and other ideas now growing out of it represent one of the first great successes of the theory of complexity\u2019.",

A change in one element is not directly proportional to change in another; more prosaically, little changes can have big effects. By feedback is meant the arrangement of networked relationships such that one element affects others which in turn can, ultimately, affect the original element. A very simple example would be that vehicle exhaust emissions increase the burden of air pollution, which may in turn increase the incidence of asthma. A control mechanism (and hence negative feedback) might be to reduce traffic levels, thereby cutting exhaust emissions.",

Relationships \u2018shift and change, often as a result of self-organisation\u2019 (Cilliers, 1998, p. viii\u2013ix), and new system properties may emerge. \u2018The capacity for self-organisation is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structure spontaneously and adaptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment\u2019 (Cilliers, 1998, p. 90). Self-organisation does not imply some teleological control mechanism; rather, it implies a process whereby complex structure emerges through simple, unstructured beginnings. Others speak of autopoiesis (literally, self-making), where each system component aids the transformation of other components; the network makes itself. What might be examples of emergent properties in the geography of health; what emerges at a collective level that cannot be reduced to statements about individuals? The \u2018health\u2019 of a neighbourhood or community could be said to emerge from the activities and health profiles of the local population, as well as the nature of facilities (health-promoting and health-denying) located there. \u2018Social capital\u2019 would be another example of an emergent property. Conversely, the mortality profile of such a neighbourhood is, in effect, the summation of individual deaths and would not be said to be an emergent property.",

The recognition that complexity theory gives to connectedness and hybridity, and to breaking down divisions (whether the social and material, structure and agency, or macro/micro) means that it has much in common with actor-network theory (Milligan, 2001; Law & Moll, 2002), although as yet there seems little coming together of actor-network and complexity theorists.",

Reitsma (2003, p. 14) sees chaos theory as dealing with simple, deterministic, non-linear, dynamic, closed systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. Conversely, complexity theory focuses on non-linear, open systems. These respond to perturbation by organising into emergent forms which cannot be predicted from knowledge only of the system parts. As Sherden (cited in Thrift, 1999, p. 61) argues: \u2018Chaos refers to turbulent behaviour in a system where the behaviour is totally determined by non-linear laws which amplify the smallest of errors in the initial conditions of the system, making the system unpredictable beyond the shortest of periods. Complexity refers to the phenomenon of order emerging from complex interactions among the components of a system influenced by one or more simple guiding principles\u2019.",

Further, the argument that relations are more important than the objects or system parts is shared with other accounts in social science.

It is somewhat ironic to think that this might be reappearing (Barab\u00e1si, 2002; Watts, 1999; Buchanan, 2002) after being largely ignored by geographers for 25 years. This neglect was occasioned by the emphasis of spatial analysts on network description and spatial form, and the lack of any social content. However, the considerable contemporary effort expended on shedding light on the structure of social networks (and particularly the \u2018small-world\u2019 problem) seems little concerned with the realities of social interaction. A Rwandan refugee may be six steps away from the President of the United States, but the probability of them ever interacting directly is vanishingly small. Comments such as \u2018[t] he global village we\u2019ve grown used to inhabiting is a new reality for humans\u2019 (Barab\u00e1si, 2002, p. 39) ring rather hollow for most of the billions living in the village.

However, while classical systems approaches emphasise problem-solving, prediction and control, complexity theorists undertake exploratory research that emphasises explanation and understanding. Moreover, while relations and networks are critical in complexity theory, as they were in classical approaches, CT foregrounds notions of emergence and hybrids. It is these features that perhaps provide \u2018added value\u2019 and which were missing from classical systems-theoretic accounts.

Complex accounts are \u2018absolutely not reductionist and positivist\u2019. Like Urry, Byrne sees complexity theory as a way of relating macro and micro, agency and structure. In contrast, Cilliers (1998) identifies complexity as a postmodern enterprise. For him, postmodern (perhaps, better, post-structuralist) means a sensitivity to complexity. This is roundly endorsed by Henrickson and McKelvey (2002), who suggest that the ontology of postmodernism parallels that of complexity scientists. \u2018The lesson from complexity science is that natural scientists have begun finding ways to practice normal science without assuming away the activities of heterogeneous autonomous agents. There is no reason, now, why social scientists cannot combine \u201cnew\u201d normal science epistemology with postmodernist ontology. Yet very few have done so\u2019 (Henrickson & McKelvey, 2002, p. 7293).

Thrift, like Urry, considers CT to be \u2018deeply metaphorical\u2019 (Thrift, 1999, p. 36), but, interestingly, the metaphors \u2018nearly all strongly depend upon the visual register\u2019 (Thrift, 1999, p. 37).

These authors consider that \u2018examples of scientism can be found in the alleged \u201capplications\u201d of the theories of chaos, complexity and self-organisation to sociology, history and business management\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 181).

The importing of concepts must have some conceptual or empirical justification. They observe that \u2018a metaphor is usually employed to clarify an unfamiliar concept by relating it to a more familiar one, not the reverse\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 9). Further, \u2018The natural sciences are not a mere reservoir of metaphors ready to be used in the human sciences\u2026in a scientific context these words (chaos, non-linearity, for example) have specific meanings\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 177).

Complexity is about relationships that cannot be reduced to simple linear models or their variants (such as logistic regression). It counters much traditional (geographical and environmental) epidemiology and public health that relates health outcomes to determinants at the individual level. Even the now widely used multi-level modelling (MLM) is cast within the same mould, since it fails to capture connection, relationship and context in an adequate way. While Byrne (1998, p. 68) says that \u2018the world does consist of things which contain things\u2026the hierarchical character of data is real\u2019, and Krieger (1994) also applauds the use of MLM as a device for capturing the often-missed contextual factors, it is doubtful that MLM offers an adequate methodology for capturing the complexity of context. It is not just the individuals or a simple aggregation thereof that matter\u2014the containing social system matters too.

But, as she notes, the \u2018web\u2019 was \u2018spiderless\u2019, positing a biomedical model in which the orientation was individualistic rather than population-focused and reflecting a concern less with epidemiological theory and more with epidemiological methods. One alternative to a web-based approach would be a political economy perspective in which the health status of different social groups (women versus men, gays versus straights, black versus white, poor versus rich) are compared in terms of the relations between such groups. Krieger, however, prefers an \u2018ecosocial\u2019 epidemiological theory in which population-level approaches are combined with biological thinking. She would replace the web metaphor with a \u2018fractal\u2019 metaphor in which biological and social factors are linked at every level or scale. Admittedly, \u2018this is not a developed metaphor\u2019 (Krieger, 1994, p. 899); nonetheless, at a very broad scale it is very much in keeping with a complexity agenda in which there are no sharp boundaries between global social relations and the environment (Urry, 2003, p. 46).",

So, at a national scale the prevalence of AIDS in the USA is accounted for by social proximity to (contact with) New York City, as well as a measure of social disintegration (violent crime) and manufacturing employment. Using methods from the study of ecosystem dynamics, the authors show how we might estimate the impact, on the system, of external perturbations such as economic decline, population turnover, or welfare reform.

Such networks \u2018do not possess an epidemic threshold below which diseases cannot produce a major epidemic outbreak or the onset of an endemic state.

Clearly, in the light of statements such as these we need to develop further the connections between the complexity agenda and the disease ecology tradition that pre-dates it by several decades (Meade & Earickson, 2000: Chapter 2; Levins & Lopez, 1999). Mayer (2000, p. 937) notes that a key principle of disease ecology is that \u2018population, society and both the physical and biological environments are in dynamic equilibrium\u2019. But a key feature of CT is that systems may be far from equilibrium (Table 1), in which case we need, as Mayer argues, a good understanding of the impact that land-use change, climate change, population turnover, and so on have on population health. In particular, the emergence and resurgence of particular diseases needs to be set in the wider context of changes that are economic, political and social, as well as environmental. A good example would be Lyme disease, where \u2018[t]he chain of events that have led to the emergence and recognition of Lyme disease in New England is complex\u2019 (Mayer, 2000, p. 942). It is, Mayer argues, \u2018reductionist\u2019 to suggest that the \u2018cause\u2019 of Lyme disease is to be found simply in a good understanding of the pathogen involved. But to take other examples (such as TB and HIV/AIDS) we need to develop a better understanding of the links between population health and the processes of globalisation. Among these processes Mayer gives prominence to those of population movement.",

It resulted from one tiny \u2018blip\u2019 in the constant movement of cattle to abattoirs, a blip that nonetheless carried the infection from one farm to a market from whence the disease spread rapidly. Again, it is the movement (flow) that matters, a set of relations that involves hybrids of human and non-human actors. Loss of income to farmers and those institutions and businesses sustaining the farming community, together with the tourist sector, were all unintended consequences, forcing, in effect, the virtual closure of the countryside (Convery et al., 2005) for about 12 months. \u2018This has in part led to a loss of self-esteem, an increasing sense of isolation amongst livestock farmers and called into question a \u201cwhole way of life\u201d and social identity\u2019 (Convery et al., 2005). In Cumbria, 40 per cent of farms were subject to animal culls (rising to 70 per cent in the north of the county), with over 1 million sheep, 215,000 cattle, and 39,000 pigs slaughtered. The scale of slaughter impacted on local sense of identity and \u2018on their everyday living and working relations with the landscape, livestock and with others in their community\u2026there was a clear breach of normal relations\u2019 (Convery et al., 2005, original italics). \u2018Death was in the wrong place (the farm rather than the abattoir), but it was also at the wrong time (in relation to the farm calendar) and on the wrong scale (such large-scale slaughter seldom occurs at the same time)\u2019 (Convery et al., 2005).",

He seeks to understand both their daily, taken-for-granted, habitual lives and how \u2018they accommodate to turning points and transitional events in their lives\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 53S), appealing to complexity theory in the search for this understanding. He looks at the daily routines of older people within their communities as \u2018part of a whole, a social ecology that functioned as a delicately balanced homeostatic system\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 55S). Interestingly, he cites Roger Barker's ecological psychology here and, as an aside, this approach to psychology and place is something that geographers in general, and health geographers in particular, seem to have missed (Barker, 1968). But Rowles seems keen to move from interesting biographical accounts to \u2018consider each resident of Colton as immersed in a complex system of inextricably interrelated actions, relationships, and environmental meanings that are in a state of homeostatis. This homeostasis has its own dynamic, with consequences reverberating throughout the system when any element changes\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 59S). Thus, the ecology is disrupted when people die or become ill (and the network of relationships thereby changes). Their lives are \u2018immersed in messy, complicated, interconnected systems that are not linear, static, or absolutely predictable\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 61S). Aside from wondering what \u2018linear\u2019 means in this context this remark seems rather uncontroversial, since all of us live lives that have the same characteristics. I am not convinced that our understanding of the mental well-being of older Appalachian folk is significantly enhanced by Rowles\u2019 appeal to complexity theory. I would argue that we gain as much\u2014maybe more\u2014from the time-space geographies that H\u00e4gerstrand (1970) proposed, long before complexity theory emerged, and which Rowles himself cites. Alternatively, very sophisticated and engaging accounts of lives lived in particular places (for example, Davidson, 2003) have been developed without a wholly metaphorical use of complexity theory.",

The qualitative is there, but in the form of qualitative structures and patterns, not in the nature of the embodied actor. An exception might be Rowles\u2019 work, though I have argued above that a complexity perspective offers relatively little in our understanding of lived worlds in small rural communities. Is the behaviour of a small number of older people in an isolated setting so very complex? Stewart (2001) considers that \u2018[T]he bulk of writing on social complexity is decidedly limited in its relation to social relevant philosophical traditions such as phenomenology, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, and modernist retrieval of lived experience in a devastated world\u2019 (Stewart, 2001, p. 334). He bemoans the neglect of real lives and actors (real people in contested history\u2014Stewart, 2001, p. 354). Some complexity theorists appear to agree. As Barab\u00e1si has it: \u2018The goal before us is to understand complexity. To achieve that, we must move beyond structure and topology and start focusing on the dynamics that take place along the links. Networks are only the skeleton of complexity, the highways for the various processes that make our world hum. To describe society we must dress the links of the social network with actual dynamical interactions between people\u2019 (Barab\u00e1si, 2002, p. 225).",

Territory and a sense of identity with particular places still matters. Spatial segregation has health impacts, our social connections and support at local level still matters, and the connections and relations stressed by complexity theorists are still very firmly local, at least for some. Those living in affluent countries might be exposed to viruses circulating in Africa or elsewhere (Haiti, for example, Farmer, 1992, Farmer, 1999) and such viruses may well have impacts that become global in their reach. But the impact, in terms of disease burden, is surely many times more acute in the poorest regions of the world.",

Haggett's comment that \u2018one can do little with the unique except contemplate its uniqueness\u2019 (Haggett, 1965, p. 3) is equally true of some invocations of complexity.
