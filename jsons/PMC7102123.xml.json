It is known to cause pulmonary injury leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary toxicity is accelerated with exposure to high-inspired concentration of oxygen. Bleomycin-induced lung injury or BILI is from release of cytokines and free radicals, related to low levels of bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) in the lung. BLMH deactivates bleomycin. It is believed that in the presence of higher inspired oxygen concentrations, free radical formation increases, accelerating lung injury. This leads to an immunologically mediated inflammatory response causing a pneumonitis, eventually culminating in pulmonary fibrosis [2]. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity is seen in about 40\u201345% of patients with a mortality reaching 3%. Risk factors include age, smoking, cumulative drug dose, poor renal function, concomitant use of oxygen, and radiation therapy.",

Since then, transition from mouse to fully human mAbs has successfully taken place leading to successful clinical use. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to identify and attach themselves to surface antigens on tumor cells thus rendering them visible to host immune system (alemtuzumab (Campath)) leading to direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by apoptosis or inhibiting cell growth by inactivating key proteins, (trastuzumab (Herceptin)) or kill targeted tumor cells through antibody-dependent and complement-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC and CDC). Antibodies can recruit immune cells such as T cells or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and can also be used to deliver chemo (brentuximab (Adcetris)) and radiation (ibritumomabtiuxetan (Zevalin) to cancer cells [25]. As expected, a multitude of general immune-mediated side effects like allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), serum sickness, tumor lysis syndrome, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and dermatitis are common. More serious side effects like cytokine release syndrome, re-activation of latent tuberculosis, progressive multifocal leuco-encephalopathy, generally due to reactivation of John Cunningham virus, are often fatal [26].",

PD-1 and PD L-1 are checkpoint proteins that can be blocked to achieve checkpoint inhibition.

The purpose of this assessment among other things is to clarify patient and surgical specific risks and recognize when such a risk can be optimized in a patients favor. Cancer-related fatigue and treatment-induced physiological derangements make it difficult to identify where the source of physiological dysfunction lies. It may be impossible to assess the integrity of the cardiovascular system based on physical activity (a key determinant of cardiac integrity in ACC/AHA guidelines). When on top of this, a patient has undergone therapies that are cardio toxic, the picture becomes fuzzier. One then has to rely on investigations like serial troponins, echocardiograms, and their interpretations to determine as true a cardiac status as possible. If cardiac injury is found, then one must determine the necessity vs risk of surgery and the effects of delaying cancer therapy. If we do need to \u201ccancel\u201d a case, we must ensure that the time gained by this delay is primarily used to reduce the assessed risk that has resulted in the delay. These decisions have to be made in conjunction with the patient, surgeon, and oncologists involved in patient care. The dialog should be transparent with clearly established goals.
