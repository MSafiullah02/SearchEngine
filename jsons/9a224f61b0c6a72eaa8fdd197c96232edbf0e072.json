Wells developed at that time [1] in connection with the transmission of tuberculosis was the following: The drops produced by sneezing and coughing would have a wide size distribution and would fly out of the mouth and nose without much interaction between them. The small droplets would hardly be a problem because they would evaporate very quickly in the air and leave dry and therefore less dangerous aerosol particles behind, while the large droplets would behave ballistically. In this model, which is still used for risk assessment, the border between large and small is set quite arbitrarily at a droplet diameter of 5 -10 \u00b5m. For comparison: a virus has a typical diameter of 100 nm. (Bacteria such as the tubercle bacillus are more than ten times as large.) A drop with a diameter of 1 \u00b5m can therefore still contain 10 viruses at a virus concentration of 1%. Under which circumstances this is sufficient for an infection depends on the virus and is still unknown for the corona virus.",

In addition, they are ejected as a cloud, whereby they protect each other against evaporation, so to speak: The rate of evaporation is determined by the moisture gradient on the surface of the droplets. This is, of course, much smaller in a cloud of droplets where each of the droplets releases water vapor to the environment than for individual, isolated droplets. These two effects together can easily delay the evaporation of the small droplets by a factor of 1000 [2] . Their lifetime is therefore not determined by their size itself, but by the fluid dynamics of the water vapor concentration in the spray cloud around them [5, 6] .",

These two effects can partly compensate each other. Important factors that determine the density of the cloud are the entrainment effect of the surrounding air and the rate at which the heavy droplets sink to the ground. Over time, this second effect can even make the turbulent droplet cloud lighter than its surroundings and rise [3] . Lydia Bourouiba and collaborators have already modeled these effects in 2014 with a simple hydrodynamic model (see the sketch in Fig. 2) . The model is in good agreement with measured data on the range of droplet clouds of defined size [3] .",

It is therefore not surprising that the level of contamination of passengers and crew on cruise ships on which COVID19 has broken out is so high.

Obviously, it makes sense to minimize the release of saliva and mucus droplets into the environment, for example by sneezing and coughing in the crook of your arm (whereby, by the way, everyone can immediately convince himself or herself that the turbulent jet is indeed warm). Exhaling through a mask, in which the droplets get caught, clearly is also useful in closed buildings, to reduce the input of contaminated droplets into the surroundings. In particular, the knowledge that the range of the turbulent jets loaded with saliva and mucus droplets is not one to two meters, but eight meters and more, should lead to suitable protective measures for medical personnel (high-quality masks, possibly protective clothing). The ventilation systems in buildings with infected persons should also be adapted.",

These viscoelastic properties play an important, generally inhibiting role in the fragmentation process [4] , which strongly influences the droplet size distribution and thus the lifetime and range of the turbulent droplet cloud.
