Despite the fact that international consensus is lacking on how biotechnology has to be treated, the biotechnology innovators opt for patenting their invention. Webber (2003) has insisted that research outcomes of pharmaceutical sector, any biotech start-up or academia should be protected by patents. This is because enormous efforts, hard work, and financial inputs are needed to develop a novel drug or product out of hundreds and thousands of lead compounds. It is therefore prerogative for a company or institute to protect their innovative products from unauthorized duplication (Raj et al. 2015) .",
