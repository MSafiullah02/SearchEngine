Considering biosafety issues and lack of positive specimens in some special locations in China, the routine specimens from healthy individuals were used to perform methodologies evaluations, in which the indexes were the differences of quantification cycle values (\u0394C q ) between human derived internal reference control (IRC) genes of a specimen and quality control (QC). Serial experiments were carried out to evaluate various factors that might affect aforementioned methodologies, such as types of virus transport mediums, methods of specimen pretreatment and template preparation, specimen vortex strength, specimen storage temperature and duration. The results showed that using \u0394 C q values as indexes, among various factors that might affect analytical performance, it was better to store specimens in the normal saline transport mediums, inactivate pathogens using water or metal bath, release more virus particles from swabs by vortex mixing, extract nucleic acids with centrifuge methods, and perform amplification assays timely. Aforementioned opinions and optimum conditions were further confirmed by SRAS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and clinical positive specimens. Altogether, the results of this study indicated that the routine specimens from healthy individuals could be used to evaluate the analytical performance of real-time fluorescent RT-PCR targeting SRAS-CoV-2, of which the indexes were the \u0394 C q values between IRC genes of a specimen and QC. This acceptable method was extremely valuable in both theoretical and practical significance under current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 .",

Up to May 18, 2020, nearly twenty kinds of kits targeting SARS-CoV-2 were commercially available in China. Because there were various methods to preserve collected oropharyngeal swabs (e.g. various virus transport mediums), pretreat specimens, and prepare nucleic acid templates, it was essential to perform methodology evaluations to screen the optimum conditions to ensure reliable results of commercial kits targeting SARS-CoV-2. However, there were still no studies to suggest how to make aforementioned selections. It might be the reasons that several times of RT-PCR detections were needed to confirm suspected cases of COVID-19 [6, 7] . Therefore, it is extremely necessary to evaluate the relevant methods of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detections, in order to guide the laboratory technicians to select the most appropriate methods to ensure reliable diagnosis results for the clinic.",

Compared with conventional strategies using specimens from COVID-19 confirmed cases, the current evaluation methods using specimens from healthy individuals had advantages as follows at least: much simpler and safer to collect various specimens, and more easily to perform evaluations just in routine clinical laboratories without considering biosafety issues. Based on above opinions, in this study, the specimens of oropharyngeal swabs collected from healthy individuals were used to evaluate the analytical performance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detections, in which the indexes were the Compared with both MB and OS methods of template preparations, the CF methods showed the best analytical performance. Using larger initial volume of specimens, the CF methods exhibited theoretical advantages and practical results than OS methods ( Fig. 1-4) . Moreover, although using same initial volumes of specimens, the CF methods also showed better performance than MB methods ( Fig. 1-4) , which might be associated with the relative lower recovery rate of MB methods [19] .
