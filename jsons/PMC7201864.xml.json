In addition to variations in viral load measured by NAT, as infections evolve the infectivity of viruses change profoundly.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n For HIV (and its model agent simian immunodeficiency virus), HBV, HCV, and WNV, it is now well established that during the acute preseroconversion phase of infection (pre\u2013ramp\u2010up and ramp\u2010up stages), virion particles in plasma are highly infectious, with 10 or fewer geq in the entire volume of plasma sufficient to transmit infection following parenteral injection. In contrast, viral particles present in plasma from the same infected individuals have significantly (10\u2010 to 1000\u2010fold) reduced infectious potential weeks to years after seroconversion.\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n, \n35\n, \n40\n, \n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n The reduced infectivity of plasma virus from postseroconversion phases of chronic infection is attributable to a combination of factors, including presence of endogenous neutralizing antibodies, generation of defective virions (i.e., lacking full genomes or other required infectivity factors), and immune selection of virions with reduced fitness. Hence, viral load distributions observed during acute versus chronic stages of infection need to be adjusted by a factor to account for the relative infectivity of virion particles to derive estimates for the functional viral load during each stage.",

Donors are also excluded if they have certain risk factors that make their exposure to viruses or prions more likely. Additionally, plasma manufacturers screen donated plasma in a minipool format for HBV, HAV, and parvovirus by NAT. The use of NAT greatly reduces viral loads since positive units missed by serologic screening procedures typically have the highest concentrations of virus, which is also highly infectious. Consequently, with very rare exceptions of concordant testing errors in serology and NAT screening, only units that test both serologically negative (i.e., window\u2010phase units) and that have relatively low titers of infectious virus (<500\u20105000 infectious doses [IDs]/mL) are pooled. Furthermore, manufacturing pools are retested by NAT before fractionation to assure that high\u2010titer viremic units were not missed as a result of erroneous testing.

To estimate the number of positive units missed by the screening procedures employed, currently observed NAT yields, expressed as number of positive samples per million donations, were adjusted to account for the amount the window period is believed to be closed through the use of NAT. From this, we conclude that few plasma pools will contain HIV, HCV, or HAV while contamination by HBV and parvovirus B19 will be considerably more frequent. Based on the analytical sensitivity of the NAT assays, the dilution factors during assay, and the volume of an individual donor unit, we calculated the maximum genomic load likely to be present in a fractionation pool (Table 1, Column 7). This was adjusted downward for HBV, HAV, and parvovirus B19 to account for the reduced infectivity of virus that occurs as a result of neutralizing antibodies derived from other donors in the pool, since antibody screening is not performed for these prevalent agents. No adjustment was applied to HIV or HCV since later\u2010stage infections with potential neutralizing antibodies are interdicted by the currently deployed serologic tests. Although attempts to transmit vCJD by human plasma have failed,\n44\n epidemiologic evidence supports its transmission by whole blood and blood components.\n45\n, \n46\n, \n47\n Based on animal models, its concentration is likely to be quite low, estimated at 20 to 30 IDs per mL.\n48\n With the use of this estimate, the maximum concentration in the plasma pool approximates 0.003 IDs per mL (3 IDs/L), and the total maximum load in a 6000\u2010L plasma pool will approximate 104.3 IDs (Table 1).",

The process steps for fibrinogen and thrombin used by Omrix are outlined in Fig. 1. As is typical of modern plasma protein products, each process includes two dedicated, viral elimination steps: fibrinogen is treated with S/D and is pasteurized, and thrombin is treated with S/D and is passed through a purposefully designed, virus removal filter (so\u2010called nanofiltration). Additionally, each chromatographic step and filtration in the presence of filter aid can contribute to pathogen removal. Baxter's Tisseel is processed similarly except, when first introduced in 1998, it utilized vapor heating as its sole, dedicated virus inactivation step; S/D treatment has been added recently. Another difference is that its thrombin component is isolated starting with Baxter's activated prothrombin factor complex.",

The clearance factors for enveloped viruses and the models for HIV, HCV, and HBV exceed the challenge dose for each of the dedicated viral elimination steps (i.e., S/D, pasteurization, nanofiltration, and vapor heating). Consequently, when the same virus has been studied in each of the two dedicated steps, the validated clearance factors exceed 9 log, and where higher doses of virus have been used or more steps validated, clearance factors as large as 18 log have been reported. The validated clearance of nonenveloped viruses is significantly less than for enveloped viruses since only one of the two dedicated viral elimination methods is effective against these viruses. Parvoviruses are a special case since they are especially heat\u2010stable, and only 1 to 2 log of animal parvoviruses are inactivated by either pasteurization or vapor heating. It should be noted, however, that human parvovirus B19 may be more heat\u2010sensitive than the models used here.\n49\n Nanofiltration is significantly more effective, and Omrix has shown for its thrombin preparation that nanofiltration removes approximately 6 log of parvoviruses.",

            "text": "A more complete estimate of safety margin needs to take into account the contribution of the other steps in the process that contribute to safety despite not being formally validated. It is commonly accepted that immune neutralization contributes to HAV and parvovirus B19 safety and that the neutralization capacity of antibodies to these viruses is at least 3 to 4 log.\n50\n Since fibrinogen is purified by simple precipitations, it, like intermediate\u2010purity FVIII preparations, likely benefits from the copresence of antibody in the final preparation.\n51\n Ion\u2010exchange chromatography typically removes 2 to 3 log of virus.\n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n, \n55\n Finally, some contribution to the calculation of safety margins should be ascribed to the \u201creserve capacity\u201d of the viral inactivation method(s) employed, defined as the ability to achieve complete virus kill in a fraction of the treatment time allotted. While numerous publications make clear that linear extrapolation of virus inactivation curves overstates inactivation potential,\n56\n, \n57\n assigning no benefit to reserve capacity when calculating safety margins clearly underestimates inactivation capacity. Unless data indicate otherwise, we propose adopting the scheme described in Table 5. Although seemingly arbitrary, this scheme has the value of simplicity. Its use is supported by the dozens if not hundreds of times results with S/D and heat treatment methods have been reproduced, thereby increasing the quantity of virus subjected to challenge. Also, for S/D treatment methods, viral kill has been shown to be complete even when using tri\u2010(n\u2010butyl)phosphate (TNBP) together with sodium cholate, a combination that provides far slower kill kinetics than the more frequently employed TNBP\u2010Tween 80 or TNBP\u2010Triton X\u2010100 combinations (Fig. 2), and the fact that reagent concentration can be halved without affecting viral kill (data not shown). We have not made reserve capacity estimates for vapor heating since much of the loss in viral infectivity occurs before initiation of the heat cycle (Fig. 3).",

This is a direct consequence of the multiple improvements adopted by manufacturers of purified blood products over the past 20 years including deploying robust methods of virus inactivation.",

            "text": "Calculated safety margins for nonenveloped viruses are smaller since the manufacturing procedures for many plasma proteins, including both fibrinogen and thrombin, typically employ only one dedicated viral inactivation and/or removal method effective against these viruses, and parvoviruses are especially stable to thermal inactivation. There are no reports of HAV transmission by fibrin sealants even before adoption of NAT screening procedures. This is in accord with the finding that coagulation FVIII preparations did not transmit HAV provided they were either heat\u2010treated or affinity\u2010purified.\n71\n Additionally, given the modest processing fibrinogen undergoes and the known presence of immunoglobulin G in cryoprecipitate, it is reasonable to assume that fibrinogen is further protected by anti\u2010HAV, present as a \u201ccontaminant.\u201d",

            "text": "Numerous reports describe the transmission of parvovirus B19 by coagulation factor concentrates\n72\n and its transmission by fibrin sealant has also been reported.\n58\n Frequent transmission results from the high concentration of virus that can be present in plasma pools containing units from donors with acute\u2010phase viremia\n73\n and because parvovirus is not inactivated by S/D and is relatively stable to heat treatment methods. Beginning around 2001, commercial manufacturers of plasma products began employing NAT to screen incoming plasma units in a minipool format to limit viral loads. Originally, testing was performed to ensure that titers did not exceed 105 geq per mL; for Omrix's and Baxter's fibrin sealant products, a standard of not more than 104 geq per mL has been adopted for the minipool being tested. A recent article by Geng et al.\n51\n confirms the benefits of screening incoming plasma for parvovirus B19 by NAT. Despite this improvement, the maximum load of infectious virus that might be present remains considerable, and it would appear that the fibrinogen component might still transmit parvovirus B19, albeit at very low frequency. Clinical studies will be required to confirm this since the antibody content of fibrinogen might provide adequate protection, or parvovirus B19 might be more sensitive to heat treatment than the animal parvovirus models used, as has been suggested.\n74\n The greater safety margin calculated for the thrombin component arises from the use of more vigorous purification procedures and the overall effectiveness of nanofilters in removing parvovirus. Because of its size and shape, fibrinogen cannot be nanofiltered successfully.",

Safety may result from the geographic restrictions that have been instituted to eliminate individuals who are at high risk of exposure, the very low levels in blood, and its removal by steps in common use including precipitations, filtrations, and column chromatography. If a vCJD contaminated unit was included in the plasma pool, the calculated safety margin for fibrinogen and thrombin is very high. Unlike viruses used in spiking studies, however, the structure of the causative agent of vCJD is unknown and may differ significantly from the models in use. Because of this uncertainty and the devastating nature of the disease, the authorities in the United Kingdom have concluded that recipients of plasma\u2010derived FVIII, F IX, and antithrombin prepared using donations from individuals who subsequently developed vCJD should be told that they may be at increased risk for developing the disease.\n75\n This emphasizes the importance of donor exclusion criteria implemented for all products licensed in the United States or Europe. With these exclusions taken into account, the risk for vialed product should remain well less than 1 in 1 million for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 1 trillion for thrombin.",

In addition to the validated studies presented to the FDA and other regulatory agencies, we examined other steps in the manufacturing process that were likely to contribute to safety together with published information from other related processes. We also have taken into account the benefit of using viral inactivation methods that have a large reserve capacity. Our intent in employing this approach was not to replace the stricter approach taken by regulatory authorities, but simply to more completely assess safety. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our calculations are estimates and actual findings may differ. Acknowledging these shortcomings but based on our calculations, we encourage manufacturers and other interested parties to continue seeking ways to enlarge the safety margin, especially for nonenveloped viruses and to address the theoretical risk posed by vCJD",
