CoVs are divided into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltaCoVs (de Groot et al., 2013). BetaCoVs are further subdivided into four lineages/subgroups: A, B, C, and D (Chan et al., 2015). To date, both alpha- and betaCoVs are found to infect humans (Lu et al., 2015), causing subclinical or very mild symptoms and accounting for 10\u201315% of common colds (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003). In addition, CoVs can also be life-threatening and have pandemic potential. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which belongs to lineage B of the betaCoVs, originated in southern China in 2002 and spread to 28 countries, infecting over 8000 and leading to almost 800 related deaths (WHO, 2004). The outbreak of MERS-CoV, a member of the lineage C betaCoVs (Cotten et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012), has caused 1832 laboratory-confirmed cases since 2012, including 651 related deaths as of Nov. 28, 2016 (WHO, 2016). Unlike the SARS-CoV, which suddenly disappeared after a massive global disease control effort, especially in China, the number of MERS-CoV infections is still on the rise.",

The data also underscore that bats are the likely natural reservoir for MERS-CoV (Annan et al., 2013, Ithete et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014). For instance, viral gene fragments identical or quite similar to those of MERS-CoV have been reported in bats (Annan et al., 2013, Ithete et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013). Moreover, parallel studies from our group and others show that BatCoV HKU4, grouped in lineage C with MERS-CoV, can also use human CD26 (hCD26; the receptor of MERS-CoV) for viral entry (Wang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014). In other words, two members in lineage C use the same human receptor. One has caused a human infection epidemic (MERS-CoV), and the other can utilize the same receptor (BatCoV HKU4) and has potential to infect humans. This highlights the necessity of surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs, including BatCoV HKU5, which was first sequenced in 2006 in Japanese pipistrelles (Pipistrellus abramus) (Woo et al., 2006) and is circulating in bats (Lau et al., 2013). Whether the virus has the potential to bypass the bat-human barrier needs to be evaluated.",

S is further divided into two parts: S1, responsible for receptor binding, and S2, which initiates fusion (Belouzard et al., 2012, Dai et al., 2016, Kielian and Rey, 2006). S1 contains two relatively independent structures named the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) based on their position. Most betaCoVs use the CTD as the receptor-binding domain (RBD/CTD) except mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which uses the NTD to bind the cellular receptor carcinoembryonic-antigen-related cell-adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) (Dai et al., 2016, Du et al., 2009, Li et al., 2005a, Lu et al., 2013, Peng et al., 2011). Two of the RBD/CTDs in lineage C betaCoVs (MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD) bind to the same human receptor CD26 (hCD26) to initiate infection, and the two domains share high sequences identities (55%) in addition to high structural similarities, with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.114 (193 C\u03b1) (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014). Despite the similar sequence identities between HKU5-CTD and MERS-RBD/CTD (54%) or HKU4-RBD/CTD (57%), no detectable binding was found between HKU5-CTD and hCD26. The structural basis for this variation remains to be elucidated.",

Similar to other solved structures, HKU5-CTD contains two subdomains: the core subdomain homologous to other CTDs in betaCoVs and the external subdomain, which resembles MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD, indicating conservation of the external domain in lineage C. However, two deletions in HKU5-CTD lead to structural shifts in the hCD26-interaction interface and thereby result in its inability to bind this receptor. Our results suggest that the characteristic insertions in \u03b2c4 and \u03b2c5 among different lineages in betaCoVs result in different receptor engagement, thereby contributing for potential interspecies transmission.",

            "text": "We first characterized the S protein of BatCoV HKU5 through bioinformatics analysis. BatCoV HKU5 S is composed of 1352 amino acids and exhibits typical features of CoVs S protein, including the predicted hydrophobic residue-rich HR1 and HR2 motifs and a similar concentration of hydrophobic amino acids to SARS-CoV fusion peptide (FP), internal fusion peptide (IFP), and pre transmembrane domain (PTM) (Gao et al., 2013, Mahajan and Bhattacharjya, 2015, Xu et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004). Like MERS-CoV S protein, a furin-like protease recognition motif is predicted at position R745/A746 (S1/S2), which separates the S1 and S2 subunits (Millet and Whittaker, 2014). In addition, a second furin cleavage site can be found at R884/S885, which resembles S2\u2032 in the MERS-CoV S protein (Millet and Whittaker, 2014), indicating that the priming process of BatCoV HKU5 S in human cells probably occur in the same way like MERS-CoV (\nFig. 1A). Because most betaCoVs use their CTD to bind their respective receptors, we next focused on the evolutionary relationships of the CTDs. Consistent with the phylogenetic relationships, HKU5-CTD, HKU4-RBD/CTD, and MERS-RBD/CTD are grouped in one branch representing lineage C, while HKU1-CTD and MHV-CTD cluster together in lineage A. HKU9-CTD, a member in lineage D, is phylogenetically more related to SARS-RBD/CTD, which belongs to lineage B (Fig. 1B).",

The structure, solved through the molecular replacement method, contains a single molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, with an R\nwork of 0.2160 and an R\nfree of 0.2585 (\nTable 1). Like the other solved CTD structures of betaCoVs (Huang et al., 2016, Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016, Li et al., 2005a, Lu et al., 2013, Walls et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014), HKU5-CTD folds into two discrete subdomains, the core and the external (\nFig. 2). The core subdomain contains a five-stranded antiparallel scaffold center (core-center), which is decorated by five helices (\u03b1 or 310) and two small strands (\u03b2p1 and \u03b2p2) on the exterior. Three pairs of disulfide bonds help to stabilize the scaffold, namely C391-C415 and C445-C583, located in the peripheral region of the core subdomain (core-peripheral), and C433-C486 in the core-center, linking \u03b2c2 and \u03b2c4. Notably, two antiparallel \u03b2 strands, one of which is located in the C-terminus and the other forming the disulfide bond with the N-terminus, help to make keep two termini in proximity. In addition, traceable electron densities can be observed for two glycosylated modifications at N418 and N495, which form two protrusions at the core-peripheral region (Fig. 2).",

In lineage A, the external subdomain of MHV-CTD, which was obtained by density-guided homology modelling due to its large flexibility and poor quality of the density in this region, consists of four \u03b2 strands and three small helices (PDB code: 3CJL) (Fig. 3A). HKU1-CTD is comprised of a large, variable loop with three inlaid \u03b2 strands (Fig. 3B). The absence of clear secondary structure from residues C476-F572 indicates the flexibility of this region (PDB code: 5I08). In lineage C, three CTDs show similar external folds, with rmsd ranging from 0.962 (HKU5-CTD vs. MERS-RBD/CTD (PDB code: 4KQZ)) to 1.178 (HKU5-CTD vs. HKU4-RBD/CTD (PDB code: 4QZV)). All external subdomains are strand-dominated structures with four anti-parallel \u03b2 strands and expose a flat strand-face that is stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond (Fig. 3D-F). In lineage B, the SARS-RBD/CTD is dominated by a disulfide bond-stabilized flexible loop that connects two small \u03b2 strands (PDB code: 2GHV) (Fig. 3C). In BatCoV HKU9, representing lineage D, the external subdomain only contains one large helix in this region (PDB code: 5GYQ) (Fig. 3G).",

However, half of these regions (\u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 loop and \u03b23\u2032) have deletions in HKU5-CTD (Fig. 1C). Due to these deletions, the orientations of two loops (marked 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. 3D-F) in HKU5-CTD vary compared to MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD, which leads to conformational shifts in HKU5-CTD at the hCD26-binding interface (\nFig. 5A and E). The \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 loop in both MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD inserts into the groove formed by two helices on the side and \u03b2 strands on the bottom (Fig. 5B and F).

In \u03b23\u2032 of both hCD26-binding RBD/CTDs, the side chains of Y540 and R542 face the receptor, conferring a strong hydrophilic interaction between the ligand and the receptor. In contrast, in HKU5-CTD, the orientation of \u03b23\u2032 is opposite. In addition, Y544 in HKU5-CTD likely sterically clashes Q286, which further pushes HKU5 away from hCD26 (Fig. 5C and G). In the other beta strand of \u03b24\u2032, both MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD form a large hydrophobic interaction patch with hCD26. In HKU5-CTD, aside from the shift of the \u03b23\u2032/\u03b24\u2032 loop away from the receptor, the deletion of hydrophobic residues (e.g., W535) compared to MERS-RBD/CTD (Fig. 5D) and the substitution of hydrophilic residues (e.g., T553 and T555) instead of hydrophobic ones (I560 and V562 in HKU4-RBD/CTD) (Fig. 5H) likely inhibit HKU5-CTD binding to hCD26. In total, the conformational variations between HKU5-CTD and hCD26-binding RBD/CTDs explain the lack of hCD26 binding by HKU5-CTD. However, various deletions in HKU5-CTD loop 1 are present in nature (\nFig. 6), and might contribute to evolve for receptor binding.",

HKU9-CTD does not bind to ACE2 or hCD26 (Huang et al., 2016). In our study, we found that although HKU5-CTD displays a similar structure and topology to MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD, detailed structural analysis revealed variations at the hCD26-binding interface, which results in the loss of binding to this receptor. Thus, subtle distinctions in external subdomains could determine different receptor usage.",

            "text": "In addition to receptor binding, the priming process, which involves host proteases to liberate S2 and the fusion peptides from the otherwise covalently-linked S1 subunit, is another key factor affecting cell tropism and the entry route of CoVs. A two-step activation mechanism has been proposed for MERS-CoV entry (Millet and Whittaker, 2014). During the secretion of S protein, the proteolysis at S1/S2 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartments where furin is localized, while during virus entry into target cells, S2\u2032 is cleaved. The same proteolysis in S1/S2 and S2\u2032 is also essential for SARS-CoV infection, except that due to the lack of a furin-recognition site at S1/S2, SARS-CoV S remains uncleaved after biosynthesis and a diverse array of proteases are involved in this process (Millet and Whittaker, 2015, Simmons et al., 2011). In contrast, although BatCoV HKU4 can utilize hCD26 as a receptor, the proteolysis is stuck due to the lack of a protease site. Treatment of pseudovirus particles containing BatCoV HKU4 S protein with trypsin or importing the furin-recognition site into S protein enables the particles to infect hCD26-expressing cells (Wang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2015), indicating the BatCoV HKU4 is less adapted to human cells. However, in the BatCoV HKU5 S protein, both furin-recognition sites are present, as in MERS-CoV. Accordingly, BatCoV HKU5 S is predicted to be cleaved at S1/S2 after biosynthesis and at S2\u2032 during virus entry. Furin is a ubiquitous proteinase and expressed in nearly all cells lines. The presence of the two furin-recognition sites indicates that the priming process of BatCoV HKU5 is ready to occur.",

In addition, the key proteins for virus replication, such as the 3C-like protease, polymerase, and exonuclease of BatCoV HKU5 display high amino acid sequence similarity to those in MERS-CoV, indicating that once the genome of BatCoV HKU5 is released into host cells, genome replication, virus particle assembly, and release can readily occur. Therefore, the receptor would be the last barrier for BatCoV HKU5 to infect humans. Our data show that BatCoV HKU5-CTD does not use hCD26 as a receptor, though it folds into a very similar structure as MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD.

The S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites potentially cleaved by furin-like proteases were predicted using the ProP 1.0 server. (B) Phylogenetic tree generated using MEGA with the indicated RBD/CTD sequences. (C) Structure-based sequence alignment. The secondary structure elements are defined based on an ESPript algorithm and are labeled as in Fig. 2. The arrows and spiral line indicate strands and helices, respectively. The conserved cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds in the structures are marked with Arabic numerals 1\u20134. The beta strands in the core-center, the elements in the core-peripheral, and the structures in the external domains are marked with c, p, and the character with prime, respectively. The blue triangle and green star represent the key amino acids for binding hCD26 in MERS-RBD/CTD and HKU4-RBD/CTD, respectively, while the yellow rhombus indicates two glycosylation sites in HKU5-CTD.",
