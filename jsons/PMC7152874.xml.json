The United States is now the most affected country, surpassing 450,000 cases according to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Fears of illness, death, and uncertainty of the future are significant psychological stressors for the population, and social isolation resulting from loss of structured educational and work activities also threatens to worsen public mental health (Carvalho et al., 2020). For front-line healthcare workers, regular exposure to the illness, protective equipment shortages, and adaptation to rapidly evolving and high-stress work environments are further sources of distress (Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2020, Kang et al., 2020a). This pandemic is a potential source of direct and vicarious traumatization for everyone (Z. Li et al., 2020), which is only further emphasized by unsettling case reports of suicide deaths related to fears of contracting or spreading COVID-19 (Goyal et al., 2020, Montemurro, 2020). Therefore, several groups have rightfully called for the development and implementation of mental health screening and intervention programs for both the public and for healthcare workers (Bao et al., 2020, Xiang et al., 2020).",

Studies of past respiratory viral pandemics suggest that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms can arise in the context of acute viral infection, or after variable periods of time post-infection. Reports from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that influenza pandemics in particular have been marked by increased incidences of various neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, suicidality, and delirium (Honigsbaum, 2013, Menninger, 1926). For instance, encephalitis lethargica (EL) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS marked by hypersomnolence, psychosis, catatonia, and Parkinsonism, the incidence of which increased around the time of the \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza pandemic of the early 20th century (Von Economo, 1932). During the more recent 2009 influenza (H1N1) pandemic and other coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012), several neuropsychiatric sequelae were reported, including narcolepsy, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (Kim et al., 2017, Manjunatha et al., 2011, Tsai et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2014).",

However, beyond acute infection, the delayed or chronic effects of this pandemic, particularly on public mental health, will not be fully appreciated for several years. Thus, timely and longitudinal investigations of potential COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric outcomes are critical in disease surveillance and evidence-based therapeutic strategies. Here we review the available studies of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the context of COVID-19 for timely evaluation of the evidence. Furthermore, we postulate possible delayed post-viral sequelae of COVID-19 based on findings from other coronavirus or past viral pandemics. Lastly, potential mechanisms by which neuropsychiatric symptoms could develop, especially, in the context of immune reactions to viral illness are discussed, as are future directions.",

Notably, blood plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R) were significantly higher among fatal COVID-19 cases, indicative of hypercytokinemia, or \u201ccytokine storm syndrome,\u201d which was also reported in SARS-CoV-1 (Huang et al., 2005), and may underlie encephalopathy. Beyond the acute effects of cytokine storm, a recent meta-analysis of delirium among intensive care patients of mixed conditions reported evidence of persistent neurocognitive deficits up to 18 months post-discharge (Salluh et al., 2015), including mild cognitive impairment (Chung et al., 2020). Given other emerging evidence of hypercytokinemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Yang et al., 2020), the burden of long-term post-SARS-CoV-2 delirium may be significant, particularly for elderly patients who are more susceptible to post-infectious neurocognitive complications.",

            "text": "Newly emerging reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysfunction of olfaction and taste perception, which may be among the earliest symptoms in an unknown proportion of confirmed cases. Prior experimental studies of coronavirus have demonstrated that infection with human alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E) disrupts ciliary nasal epithelium (Chilvers et al., 2001), a possible mechanism of olfactory dysfunction. Indeed, olfactory epithelial cells express the CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), yet the precise cellular subtype that may mediate anosmia in COVID-19 remains unclear (Brann et al., 2020). For both olfactory and gustatory perception, CoV-2 infiltration of higher-order structures within the CNS, or cranial nerves such as the vagus nerve, involved in signal transduction and chemosensory processing, may underlie their dysfunction (Bromley, 2019). Although studies on post-viral olfactory disorders (PVOD) exist for influenza and other viruses, only a single case report describes persistent coronavirus-associated (SARS-CoV-1) anosmia (Hwang, 2006). Formal studies have yet to be published for CoV-2-related anosmia in spite of a growing number of clinical cases (Vaira et al., 2020); however, it has emerged as a screening criterion for COVID-19 at a growing number of clinics. Whether acute anosmia during the initial phase of infection, as reported in COVID-19, will also be associated with PVOD is currently unknown.",

Studies of healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, MERS-CoV outbreak, and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggest that the frequency and severity of psychiatric symptoms are associated with proximity to CoV-infected patients (Kang et al., 2020b, Lai et al., 2020, Lee et al., 2018, Lin et al., 2007). However, these studies did not test serology or immune markers in healthcare workers, and no studies have been performed comparing psychiatric outcomes in healthcare workers who contracted CoV during pandemics versus those who did not. Separately, seropositivity for a human CoV strain (HCoV-NL63) has been associated with history of mood disorder, although not with its polarity (i.e. unipolar versus bipolar depression) or with history of suicide attempts (Okusaga et al., 2011). Although there are very limited data available for COVID-19-related psychiatric symptoms currently, survivors of SARS-CoV-1 were clinically diagnosed with PTSD (54.5%), depression (39%), pain disorder (36.4%), panic disorder (32.5%), and obsessive compulsive disorder (15.6%) at 31 to 50 months post-infection, a dramatic increase from their pre-infection prevalence of any psychiatric diagnoses of 3% (Lam, 2009). The need for sustained follow-up of such symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, beyond documenting acute stress levels, is therefore paramount and urgent.",

No association was reported between seropositivity for HCoV-NL63 and history of psychotic symptoms in mood disorder patients in one study (Okusaga et al., 2011). However, Severance and colleagues (2011) found increased prevalence of antibodies against four HCoV strains in patients with a recent psychotic episode compared to non-psychiatric controls (Severance et al., 2011), suggesting a possible relationship between CoV infections and psychosis, which may also occur in SARS-CoV-2.",

These post-CoV complications were described in small case series, and causality therefore, cannot be definitively established. Separately, murine CoVs are neuroinvasive and precipitate demyelination (Lane and Hosking, 2010). In humans, postmortem analysis of brain tissue from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and controls indicated that HCoV RNA was present in 48% of all donors, with a greater incidence of OC43, but not 229E strain, in MS patients (Arbour et al., 2000). These findings suggest that although HCoV infiltration into the CNS is prevalent, its association with demyelinating disorders such as MS may be strain-specific. Whether recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients will exhibit an increased incidence of MS symptomatology or other delayed neurologic sequelae, is an important, yet unanswered, question that necessitates surveillance.",

After entering the CNS, CoV has been shown to induce neuronal cell death in mice (Netland et al., 2008). Further, mice infected with HCoV-OC43 develop chronic encephalitis, marked by viral persistence in neurons and behavioral abnormalities (Jacomy et al., 2006). It has been speculated that the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, particularly of medullary structures involved in respiration (e.g., solitary tract nucleus, nucleus ambiguus), may partially mediate the high incidence of respiratory failure currently seen in COVID-19 (Y.

At present, only one study to our knowledge has identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF of a COVID-19 patient with acute neurologic symptoms, including seizures (Moriguchi et al., 2020), although case reports of CoV detection in CSF among patients during the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic do exist (Lau et al., 2004). Two recent case reports of severe COVID-19 indicate meningitic and/or encephalitic pathology in the absence of viral RNA detection in CSF, which the authors suggest could be associated with transient or low viral load in the CNS, or due to lack of availability of testing (Duong et al., 2020, Ye et al., 2020). Notably, the key receptor that SARS-CoV hijacks for host intracellular invasion (ACE2) is expressed in both neurons and glia, and experimental studies of intranasally-inoculated SARS-CoV-1 infection in ACE2 transgenic mice demonstrated neuronal death and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-6) by neurons and astrocytes (Netland et al., 2008). Even in the absence of CoV-2 infiltration into the CNS, peripheral cytokines involved in the host anti-viral response (see Section 2.1) may elicit neuropsychiatric symptoms by precipitating neuroinflammatory responses and/or compromised blood-brain-interface (BBI) integrity, leading to peripheral immune cell transmigration into the CNS, and disruption of neurotransmission (Dantzer, 2018).",

There is also evidence suggesting that leukocytes can remain persistently infected by CoV (Arbour et al., 2000, Desforges et al., 2007).

The underlying mechanisms may include viral infection creating an inflammatory milieu which favors aberrant immune responses and promoting expansion of host antibodies or lymphocytes, which are cross-reactive both with viral antigen and self-antigen (i.e. \u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d) (Fairweather et al., 2005, Rose, 2017).

However, retrospective studies suggest corticosteroids are not uncommonly used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Liu et al., 2020, Mo et al., 2020, Wan et al., 2020). Similarly, high doses of corticosteroids were administered to treat SARS CoV-1 infection symptoms during the acute phase (Lee et al., 2003), but were associated with organic hallucinations and manic symptoms, which were treated with haloperidol (Cheng et al., 2004). There is ample evidence of adverse neuropsychiatric effects following corticosteroid therapy, impacting about 35% of treated patients, including cognitive and sleep disturbances, delirium, hypomania, mania, depression, and psychosis (Brown and Chandler, 2001, Warrington and Bostwick, 2006). The neuropsychiatric effects of corticosteroid treatments are typically acute and resolve upon termination of treatment, suggesting that steroid-mediated neuropsychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 cases will likely be acute, but necessitate close monitoring and intervention as needed, nonetheless. Further, other immunomodulatory treatments have been proposed for treating severe COVID-19, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), cytokine blocking medications, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (Mehta et al., 2020). However, the degree to which these agents have been used clinically, and the neuropsychiatric outcomes in infected individuals who have been exposed versus not exposed to such treatments, are unknown, highlighting the need for further investigation going forward.",

Although the extent and mechanisms of viral infiltration of gut epithelium by SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, ACE2 is expressed by gut epithelial cells, and almost 40% of COVID-19 patients present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Zhang et al., 2020). As such, gastroenterologists performing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat C. difficile have identified the need to screen donors for potential GI infiltration by SARS-CoV-2 (Ianiro et al., 2020). It may be the case that SARS-CoV-2 infection precipitates changes in gut microbial composition, which could be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms via the gut-brain axis; this remains largely speculative, but is mechanistically feasible (Li et al., 2019).",

Nevertheless, the neuropsychiatric burden of this pandemic is currently unknown, but likely to be significant. Past pandemics of this magnitude occurred tens to hundreds of years ago; therefore, epidemiologic associations between viral infection and neuropsychiatric symptoms were noted, but causality and etiopathogenic mechanisms were not well elucidated. In more recent CoV outbreaks, neuropsychiatric symptoms have generally been underexplored relative to respiratory and other symptoms. The breadth of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will likely require closer examination of the mechanisms underlying, and the interventions for, post-viral neuropsychiatric sequelae, which will likely be heterogeneous and extensive.",
