Increased levels of MBP accompanied by increased levels of the chemokines RANTES and macrophage-inhibitory protein 1a were observed in nasal aspirates from children during the virus-induced exacerbations. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was mostly undetectable in samples obtained during both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. Interleukin-5 levels were low, but tended to increase in samples from symptomatic children. These data confirm that the eosinophil product MBP and the eosinophil chemoattractant chemokines RANTES and macrophage-inhibitory protein 1a are increased in upper respiratory viral infections associated with asthma exacerbations and suggest an important role for these chemokines in regulating eosinophil influx and activation. These chemokines may represent targets for therapeutic intervention in virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

In a communitybased study of 9-to 11-year-old children, viral infections were associated with over 80% of asthma exacerbations, and rhinoviruses were responsible for 50% of the episodes [1]. There is no specific treatment for asthma exacerbations, and the mechanisms of such exacerbations are poorly understood. Two recent studies compared responses to experimental rhinovirus infections in asthmatic or allergic rhinitic subjects and normal subjects, and both implicated an increased bronchial eosinophil infiltrate in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations [3, 4] . Eosinophils can cause tissue damage by a variety of mechanisms, including the generation of toxic oxygen species and the release of toxic cationic molecules contained in their",

We recently showed that naturally occurring upper respiratory viral infections in asthmatic children induce the release of interleukin (IL)-8 into nasal secretions and that IL-8 is associated with the presence of neutrophil-derived proteins, suggesting that IL-8 may be important in neutrophil recruitment and activation [5] . However, no studies have investigated the possible role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of naturally occurring asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory viral infections. Because molecules promoting eosinophil recruitment and activation are likely targets for the development of new therapies for virus-induced asthma, we investigated whether eosinophil chemoattractants, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-5, and the chemokines RANTES and macrophage-inhibitory protein 1a (MIP-1a) [6] [7] [8] are implicated in eosinophil recruitment and activation in naturally occurring upper respiratory viral infections in children with acute asthma exacerbations.",

In the present study, we showed that viral infection of the upper respiratory tract induces release of the chemokines RANTES and MIP-1a and release of the eosinophil product MBP in vivo. This is of interest, as both of these chemokines are eosinophil chemoattractants. While MIP-1a is less potent than RANTES as an eosinophil chemoattractant, it is an important mediator in the inflammatory response to viral infection [12] . Furthermore, in a mouse model, absence of CCR1, which binds MIP-1a most strongly, resulted in reduced host defense to infection and a tilt in favor of a Th2-type response to infection [13] . Given the role of Th2 cells in asthma, these properties suggest that both MIP-1a and RANTES may be important mediators of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. This observation is supported by the finding that levels of these cytokines in atopic children were 3-fold greater than in nonatopic children.",

However, such correlations are difficult to find in clinical studies where many variables may affect the strength of a relationship between two biologic measurements. For example, other chemokines such as eotaxin or IL-8 may also be involved, perhaps in concert with RANTES and MIP-1a. Furthermore, the finding of a correlation is still not proof of a causal relationship between two variables. In our view, the known biologic functions of these chemokines and the presence of increased eosinophil mediators is sufficient to support our hypothesis that these chemokines are important in eosinophil recruitment and activation in vivo. Further studies with chemokine antagonists will be required to test the strength of this relationship.",

Concentrations of GM-CSF in nasal secretions were mostly undetectable, suggesting that this cytokine plays a minor role in the pathogenesis of naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations. This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that GM-CSF plays a minor role in upper respiratory viral infections [14, 15] . In a small group of children from whom enough clinical material remained, we also investigated the presence of IL-5. Although levels of IL-5 tended to be increased in the nasal aspirates from symptomatic children, there were no significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic children.
