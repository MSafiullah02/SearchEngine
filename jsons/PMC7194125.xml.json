Infection by SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute respiratory disease termed the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 form a spectrum, from being asymptomatic to fever with mild respiratory illness, to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death from respiratory failure or associated complications (3\u20135). As the reported incubation period varies among different patient cohorts, it is often difficult to ascertain the actual day of onset, and infected subjects who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic may go undetected (5\u20137).",

With the discovery of the virus, numerous diagnostic assays using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were developed (3). qRT-PCR is the reference standard for diagnosing infections with high sensitivity and accuracy in the Acute phase of illness. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in both throat and nasal swabs of infected individuals by qRT-PCR, which becomes almost undetectable by 14 days post-illness onset (pio) (or symptom onset) (8, 9) (Figure 2). Apart from being costly and time consuming to perform, false negative results may arise due to improper handling of nucleic acid samples, inadequate and variable sampling resulting in insufficient viral genetic material at the point of detection (after 14 days pio), or biological variation on when viral RNA is detectable by qRT-PCR (10, 15). With the limitations of qRT-PCR, immunoassays may offer another avenue to reduce undiagnosed cases, with the advantage that rapid test formats may deliver results in a relatively shorter time and lower cost (10).",

One study has reported that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM is still present in the serum after 1 month pio (12). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, on the other hand, can be present as early as 4 days pio, and peak after 17 days pio (10, 11) (Figure 2). These observations are similar to what was previously reported during a SARS-CoV infection (21). However, interestingly, one study demonstrated that longitudinal profiling of both antibodies in a population of 63 COVID-19 patients showed no specific chronological order in terms of IgM and IgG seroconversion (10), which was also observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV and another human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (22, 23). In addition, there seems to be no correlation between seroconversion rates with age, gender or time of hospitalization (10). These findings on SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies seroconversion against the S viral protein suggest the importance to test for both IgM and IgG antibodies to confirm a positive infection.",

Within the S protein antigen, cross-reactivity was observed when samples were tested against SARS-CoV S and S1 subunit proteins, and to a smaller extent, with MERS-CoV S protein (Table 1). Interestingly, there was no cross-reactivity with the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV (14). The high level of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to the high degree of genetic homology (3, 14, 19). Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed a highly conserved S2 subunit domain across coronaviruses, which may explain for the cross-reactivity observed with only the S protein of MERS-CoV, and not with the S1 subunit (14, 19). These data suggest that using an S1 subunit-based immunoassay may be more specific than the entire S antigen for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

Currently, in order to rapidly generate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, repurposing of existing SARS-CoV-specific antibodies was demonstrated. To date, two human SARS-CoV-specific antibodies, CR3022 and 47D11, have been shown to recognize SARS-CoV-2 (38, 39). CR3022 recognizes an epitope along the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which differs largely at the C-terminus residues to the RBD of SARS-CoV (38). Unfortunately, this variation in sequence impacted the ability of CR3022 to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibody 47D11, on the other hand, targets the RBD along the S1 subunit of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with similar affinities, thereby enabling cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 infection (39). While combinatory therapy has exhibited a stronger neutralization capability against SARS-CoV infection (40), a cocktail antibody approach for SARS-CoV-2 could be explored.",

One of the major setbacks of immunoassays is the inability to detect the presence of infection during the early stage of disease, as antibodies take several days to be generated after exposure to foreign material (44). As such, a recent infection may provide false negative results during serological testing. Thus, the use of RT-PCR may be more suitable to diagnose an early acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, due to the unique genetic makeup of each individual, there would be an inherent variability of the antibody response (45). This could possibly explain the difference in antibody profiles elicited among individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (10).",

Although the phylogenetically closest coronavirus, SARS-CoV, has not been reported to be circulating in the human population since 2004 (3), other endemic human coronaviruses may still pose a problem to accurately diagnose patients with true SARS-CoV-2 infection. While a recent study has demonstrated negligible cross-reactivity from human coronavirus, NL63, to SARS-CoV-2 (13), validation with other human coronaviruses remains to be investigated. In addition, prior findings on the S protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity of other coronaviruses suggest that antibodies neutralizing clinical human coronavirus isolates may not have the same degree of cross-reactivity with laboratory strains of human coronaviruses, thereby affecting the sensitivity of immunoassays (46\u201348).",

Such tests include lateral flow assay (LFA), which is a paper-based platform for the detection and quantification of analytes in complex mixtures (49). To design LFA for SARS-CoV-2 detection, an antibody specific to the viral antigen, or a viral antigen that is detectable by patient serum or plasma samples can be immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. Detection of binding between the analyte and capture antibody by a detector antibody will give rise to a colored line, closely resembling home pregnancy kits (50). POCT is advantageous as it is usually designed to be rapid, sensitive, highly accessible, and easily performed, requiring only a small amount of sample (50). Meanwhile, several hundreds of candidate POCTs are being evaluated for their applicability toward identifying SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (50). However, POCTs can't replace RT-PCR and it is crucial that these developing tests are rigorously assessed prior to use. It is important to note that wrong use and interpretation could lead to disastrous public health consequences (51).",
