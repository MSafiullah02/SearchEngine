            "text": "The contribution of diagnostic techniques to the management of patients with viral infections has increased considerably in the last decade, led by improved technologies that allow rapid, accurate and sensitive diagnosis of viral pathogens for an increasing range of infections. Rapid diagnosis allows the prompt initiation of effective antiviral therapy, especially in immunocompromised patients. Viral culture, usually in combination with immunofluorescence, has been regarded as the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses (Doing et al., 1998, Johnston and Siegel, 1991). However, these tests are not rapid and their clinical value is often limited. In the case of influenza viruses, the isolation and identification by culture requires 2\u201314 days for the diagnosis of an illness whose duration is typically 5\u20137 days (Covalciuc et al., 1999). Rapid antigen detection tests (\u22641 h) are less sensitive and sometimes less specific than culture or molecular methods but, nevertheless, can serve as a guide for appropriate treatment with antiviral agents (Storch, 2003). PCR and real-time-PCR techniques are highly sensitive, relatively specific and more rapid than cell culture (Atmar et al., 1996, Kehl et al., 2001, Liolios et al., 2001, Templeton et al., 2004, van Elden et al., 2002) and are widely used for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses but are more complex and require highly trained personnel. False-positives can result due to the high sensitivity of the PCR amplification system (Storch, 2003, Su et al., 2003). Accordingly, the need for rapid detection methods with high sensitivity and specificity that are easy to perform and interpret remains a research priority (Su et al., 2003).",

Biosensors which detect interactions between viral antigens and specific antibodies (immunosensors) can be classified according to the type of transducer used in the device (Eun et al., 2002, Mecea, 2005). Piezoelectric sensors, such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), detect mass changes due to molecular interactions on the surface of the transducer (Gajendragad et al., 2001, Vaughan et al., 1999). The application of an external electrical potential to a piezoelectric material, such as quartz, produces internal mechanical stresses that induce an oscillating electric field which, in turn, initiates an acoustic wave throughout the crystal. These waves travel in a direction perpendicular to the plate surfaces (Ebato et al., 1994, Janshoff and Steinem, 2001, Mecea, 2005).",

The frequency changes observed when a liquid is passed over the QCM crystal surface are also dependent on both the density and viscosity of the solution (Kanazawa and Gordon, 1985). QCM devices are relatively simple and convenient to use and can detect rapid, real-time responses to binding events on the crystal surface, such as antigen\u2013antibody interactions (Lee and Chang, 2005, Park et al., 2003, Skl\u00e1dal et al., 2004, Uttenthaler et al., 1998), and have been applied to several areas in biotechnology including clinical diagnosis (Janshoff and Steinem, 2001, Nath and Chilkoti, 2002) and environmental monitoring (Kurosawa et al., 2006). More recently, a new approach has been described to improve the sensitivity of QCM biosensors by the use of antibody-functionalized nanoparticles as a mass amplification probe for a QCM sensor, resulting in significant enhancement of sensitivity (Chu et al., 2006).",

Typical sensor profiles for purified A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 are shown in Fig. 2(C and D). From this data, the lowest detectable infectious titer for purified preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 was 1 \u00d7 103\n pfu/mL (10 \u03bcg/mL) corresponding to frequency shifts of 102 (\u00b111) and 115 (\u00b15) Hz, respectively (n\n = 3). Negative control background measurements in the absence of virus were 65 (\u00b110) Hz for each nanoparticle\u2013antibody conjugate preparation used.",

            "text": "QCM offers a number of potential advantages over existing techniques, which include obviating the need for labeling techniques to measure the binding reaction between virus and antibody, the use of short measurement times, operational simplicity, low cost, the opportunity to re-use the crystal sensors and the potential for online data collection. The QCM technique developed in this study was shown to be as sensitive as the shell vial method. The NP-QCM technique was more sensitive than the shell vial method and equally as sensitive as cell culture (Table 2), but required an additional step involving the use of a secondary nanoparticle-antibody conjugate. Direct detection of the virus from the nasal wash samples by QCM was not possible because of significant frequency fluctuations that occurred, possibly due to the viscosity of the samples. The heterogeneous nature of clinical samples appears to be an inherent limitation for diagnostic tests utilising piezoelectric immunosensors (Wu et al., 2005). Attempts to reduce the viscosity of the nasal wash samples of infected patients by centrifugation or microfiltration prior to analysis on our immunosensor proved unsuccessful (data not shown). However, Zuo et al. (2004) overcame this limitation by the atomisation of sputum samples containing SARS-CoV by ultrasonication prior to adsorption and detection on the immunosensor. In this initial study, an additional overnight culture step was used to overcome the viscosity effects of sputum samples resulting in an increased processing time of 2 days.",
