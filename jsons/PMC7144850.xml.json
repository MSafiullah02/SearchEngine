A, B: Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with primer set orf1ab-4 targeted the orf1ab gene for SARS-CoV-2 detection; C, D: Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with primer set S-123 targeted the S gene for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The detection was monitored by turbidity using a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter (A1, B1), and was judged by the naked eye depending on a color change from orange to green (A2, B2).
