The US government and private payers such as insurance companies have been working closely to remove any restrictions on the use of VC, also known as telehealth [6]. Now people can use consumer applications such as FaceTime, Google Hangout, and other video chat platforms to interact with a medical provider remotely [7]. Additionally, insurance coverage now covers VC between a provider and patient who have not met in person. All these attempts were necessary to avoid the gathering of large numbers of people in the same space, except for medical reasons [8]. In this study, we explored possible trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases along with COVID-19-like virtual visits. We hypothesized that there was a pattern between the location and duration of the confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-like virtual calls prior to the occurrence of confirmed cases.",

Additionally, we ran a time-motion analysis on the confirmed cases over time to understand the duration and the extent of disease spread across the state counties.

Then, the number of encounters of each county were displayed geographically on a map based on the same rule as the map of COVID-19 cases for a straightforward concept and comparison. To delve into the trend of how local COVID-19 cases increase temporally and spatially, we divided the COVID-19 cases using 2 time ranges: a 7-day time range and a day-by-day time range.

First, VC can help reduce the number of emergency department (ED) visits by providing remote medical consultation to patients residing in counties with increasing numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which will reduce medical facilities overcrowding and thereby, control the spread of the disease. Second, it is possible that we can forecast the spread of the disease by monitoring the volume and location of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and the volume and location of visits in the VC realm, as shown in the time-motion study. Alternatively, the possibility of higher numbers of confirmed cases may lead to a higher number of virtual visits as individuals self-quarantine or exercise physical distancing.",
