            "text": "Researchers have carried out many studies to investigate the association between the built environment and human health. One important strand lies in sick building syndrome (SBS), which is widely used to describe symptoms experienced inside a building, such as headaches, eye, nose, or throat irritations, itchy skin, and fatigue (e.g. Burge et al., 1987, Finnegan et al., 1984). These symptoms, while common in the general population, become more prominent the longer a person stays inside a building, but they tend to disappear when he or she goes out. It is the non-specific and untraceable nature of these symptoms from which the name SBS originated. If the exact causes of these symptoms were known to be a specific component of a building (e.g. the volatile organic compounds [VOC] emitted from finishes), they would have been classified as building-related illnesses (e.g. Menzies & Bourbeau, 1997). According to the World Health Organization (1986), up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings worldwide were potential carriers of SBS. Since then, there have been many cases of SBS, predominantly in sealed office buildings. Although poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is often blamed for causing SBS, it is empirically very difficult to locate or single out the source(s) responsible for a particular symptom.",

This communicable disease has clearly given a health warning to people who are used to high-density living. Since the SARS outbreak, we have seen an increasing amount of research not just in the medical field (e.g. Lee et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2004) but also on housing conditions and economic impact (e.g. Ho et al., 2007, Ho et al., 2004, Lai et al., 2006a, Lai et al., 2006b, Wong et al., 2006). However, the healthiness of apartment buildings in Hong Kong remains largely unknown.2\nThere is no information on the current status of occupants' health in terms of SBS symptoms. There is also no standardized tool to measure perceived IEQ in residential buildings.3\nA primary contribution of this study is to provide a systematic survey of the types of SBS symptom reported by residents in apartment buildings and the level of satisfaction to the IEQ of their homes.4\n",

Nowadays, apart from field measurements and expert opinions, occupants' feedback often forms an integral part of an IEQ assessment exercise.5\nWith the survey data, we can further look into the measurement problem of perceived IEQ when some respondents are prone to SBS. The idea is that if SBS cannot be attributed to a particular source, it is psychologically possible that occupants with SBS are satisfied with every individual component of IEQ (e.g. air quality, thermal comfort, lighting, and acoustic performance), but still give their buildings a low overall IEQ score. Whether or not this psychological possibility exists in practice is an empirical question. If it does exist, the result of perception-based IEQ assessments could well be biased, leading to a wrong decision for housing improvement, healthy building certification, and legal compliance checks.",

It emerged from an increase in the prevalence of certain combinations of symptoms observed in particular buildings during the 1980s (Skov & Valbj\u00f8rn, 1988). A whole branch of research has contributed to identifying sick buildings (Lahtinen, Huuhtanen, & Reijula, 1998), including SBS. Common SBS symptoms are established, but their exact causes are unknown. Some researchers attributed SBS to ventilation problems in sealed buildings (Letz, 1990), while others argued that SBS can also be work-related (Lyles et al., 1991). Since most early studies on SBS focused on office buildings (Burge et al., 1987, Letz, 1990, Skov & Valbj\u00f8rn, 1988, Wallace et al., 1993), whether or not SBS is related to poor building design or work pressure is difficult to discern.",

However, Letz (1990) pointed out that acute illnesses could occur in residences. Engvall et al. (2000) further confirmed this by a large-scale questionnaire survey (9808 responses out of 14,235 residences) on SBS of apartment buildings in Sweden, and found that symptoms afflicting the eye, nose, throat, and facial skin were common during the time building users stayed home. Such comprehensive evidence allows us to infer that SBS does not only arise in workplaces, but also at home.",

There are also studies on users' perception of air quality (Wargocki, Wyon, Baik, Clausen, & Fanger, 1999) and other environmental attributes (Engvall et al., 2000). As the use of perception-based assessment becomes more popular, it is worth asking if perceived IEQ could be biased by the presence of SBS. As we pointed out in the Introduction, it is important to understand this bias because if the presence of SBS leads to a divergence between the perceived levels of overall IEQ and individual IEQ components, then the validity of evaluating IEQ based on occupants' subjective assessments would be compromised.",

The details are shown in Appendix.7\nThe questionnaire was divided into three parts. The first part collected a respondent's general information like age, sex, education level, and employment status. The second part asked the respondent to report his/her health status, in particular the SBS symptoms they experienced while they were staying at home. In many SBS studies, symptoms included discomfort or problems related to the eyes, nose, throat, head, skin, and fatigue (Burge et al., 1987, Finnegan et al., 1984). Respondents were required to answer \u201cnever\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d or \u201coften\u201d. The prevalence of these symptoms from respondents in Hong Kong was then compared to another home-SBS study in Sweden by Engvall et al. (2000). Respondents were also asked to report other health-related issues like whether they were smokers and had chronic respiratory problems diagnosed by a Western doctor. These questions were derived from part of a standardized local medical questionnaire called SF-12 (Lam, Tse, & Gandek, 2005). Such health-related information is useful for robustness check in our statistical analysis. Finally, the third part of the questionnaire asked the respondent to evaluate the IEQ of his/her home. In designing the questions, reference was made to the studies by Kahlmeier, Schindler, Grize, and Braun-Fahrl\u00e4nder (2001) and Zagreus, Huizenga, Arens, and Lehrer (2004) to measure perceived indoor environmental quality and asked about the satisfaction of users with individual elements (including the noise, sunlight, and air ventilation levels) as well as their overall perception of their living environment. Respondents could answer \u201cdissatisfied\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201csatisfied\u201d. These answers will form the basis to test if the presence of SBS symptoms could lead to perception bias. Examples of the SBS and IEQ questions, translated from Chinese into English, are shown in Table 1\n. The questions were designed to be as comprehensible as possible and sometimes assisted with examples because respondents might not have been able to understand complicated questions in a self-administered questionnaire. The questions will be further elaborated and explained in the next section.",

According to the statistics provided by the government's Home Affairs Department in 2006, YTM is characterized by multi-storey buildings of 11 storeys and 34 years old, on average. Each storey usually consists of several flats, and a household typically occupies a flat of less than 100 m2. In our study, we stratified apartment buildings in YTM into different building age and location sub-groups first before random sampling in each sub-group. A total of 148 buildings were finally selected, which represent 5% of the building stock in YTM.",

Yet, in overall territorial terms, the SMRs for all diseases surveyed in this district were not statistically significant (p.27). Bad living conditions were found to be so significant in some studies that they contributed to the outbreak or even worsening of diseases (Barker et al., 2002, Leung et al., 2004, du Moulin, 1989, Tomson and Lip, 2005).

Then the questionnaires, written in Chinese, were sent to 6262 residences in YTM. For each flat, an invitation was extended only to the adult household member who spent the longest time inside his/her flat to complete the questionnaire. A total of 881 responses were received, which meant a response rate of 14%. This seemingly low response rate should be viewed in light of the response rates and scale (absolute number of respondents) for studies of similar nature with the cultural specificities of Hong Kong in mind. In the medical study by Wun, Tang, and Chao (2001) using postal questionnaire survey, the response rate was only 9.6% (with a total of 124 responses). The educational or professional background of respondents did not appear to be significant. An e-questionnaire survey for a doctoral thesis that pioneered Hong Kong light pollution research achieved just 4.6% response rate (with a total target population of 11,737 persons) (Chui, 2008). As revealed by the findings of relevant social surveys (Chan and Yung, 2004, Chui, 2008, Dissanayaka and Kumaraswamy, 1999, Hui, 2006, Lee and Chan, 1998, Leung et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2004, Shen and Tam, 2002, Tam et al., 2002, Tam et al., 2006, Wun et al., 2001), surveys administered to the general public tended to have a lower response rate than those administered to specific groups. Besides, there was also an inverse relationship between response rates and the scale of the survey. The response rate of our survey, though not impressive, was compensated by the scale of the successful interviewed information (after Chui, 2008 but on a par with Hui, 2006). To show that we have a general distribution of samples, we provide stratification of respondents according to their sex, age and education as shown in Table 2\n.",

While approximately 16% of the subjects living in buildings no older than 30 years submitted replies, this percentage fell to 9.1% for buildings built more than 40 years ago.

A lot of studies have suggested a variety of environmental and personal determinants, on which no consensus has been reached.

Medically, extreme thermal conditions can have an indirect health impact in an affluent Asian context, as in the cases of Japan (Kai et al., 2008, Wakamori et al., 2009) and Hong Kong which has a notoriously excessive \u201cair-conditioning culture\u201d in certain public places (Lin & Deng, 2006).10\nAlso, at a personal level, the period of stay at home could modify one's reporting of symptoms. But its exact effect is not clear, depending on whether a resident is more or less sensitive to the indoor environment after living in the same premises for a long period of time. Further research is needed to address these issues.",

The respondents strongly believed that their nose discomfort was building-related despite the absence of any central ventilation system in their apartment buildings. There are two implications. First, the results shed light on the controversy over whether the occurrence of SBS is mostly related to the physical indoor environment or psychosocial factors. Researchers have conducted most of their epidemiological indoor environmental studies in workplaces. The study added insight to the existing literature by arguing that SBS can also occur in residential buildings, which are presumably warm shelters for families and where job pressure should be less severe. Second, the nose symptoms are much commoner in Hong Kong than in Sweden, implying that home SBS could vary from place to place. Such a variation could be due to the fact that homes are generally less self-contained (e.g. rely more on natural lighting and ventilation) than offices so that the SBS exhibited at home depends very much more on the quality of the external environment. Further study is, however, needed to examine how much time people actually spend in the flat with the windows open or without using air-conditioners.",

This prompted us to carry out a statistical analysis of the relationship between SBS and perceived IEQ.",

            "text": "The regression analysis showed that the occurrence of some of the SBS symptoms, in particular nose and head symptoms that could be attributed to such environmental factors as air quality and density, affected how respondents rated the IEQ of their apartments. Residents with nose and head symptoms gave a significantly lower rating of their overall IEQ than those without. This is the case even after the perception of individual IEQ factors (e.g. the quality of noise, light, and air) and building characteristics have been controlled. This finding has a very important implication for those who base the evaluation of internal spaces on perceived IEQ: the overall IEQ rating would be biased downward if the respondents have SBS symptoms. That is, even if respondents were satisfied with specific IEQ criteria, the overall IEQ could still be unsatisfactory to respondents with self-reported SBS symptoms. This could purely be a perception bias that has no bearing on the actual IEQ or SBS symptoms. Ignoring this bias might lead a housing manager to make a wrong decision on improvement measures. There are two approaches to solving this problem. One is to abandon any attempt to make subjective measurements and to base all improvement decisions solely on objective IEQ investigation. This approach, however, can be very costly if objective measurement is to be carried out frequently. It also undermines the importance of customer satisfaction. The other approach is to correct for the bias in subjective IEQ assessment. This is relatively easy: ask the respondents for their SBS symptoms in addition to their IEQ ratings, and use statistical methods, such as the Heckman's (1979) two-stage estimator, to correct for the bias. In this way, occupants' opinions can be effectively incorporated into the building management process (e.g. before carrying out objective IEQ investigation and after completion of improvement work).",

The current policies are concerned mainly with some physical design features and objective measures of building environmental factors. However, the social purpose of these building designs will not be realized if occupants remain unsatisfied with their IEQ. The present study further developed a perception-based IEQ questionnaire, which has been validated through some perceived IEQ criteria and SBS symptoms. Policymakers can, through an examination of the collected responses, realize what criteria are regarded as important for evaluating overall IEQ satisfaction and enhancing the building designs pertaining to these criteria. From our survey, occupants were more sensitive to air quality and noise problems within their flats and the immediate neighborhood, and hence, perceived nose and head symptoms to be more relevant to their IEQ satisfaction. To deal with this, the IAQ Management Group should consider extending the IAQ Certification Scheme to include residential buildings to raise private developers' concern over IAQ.",

In the future, respondents may be invited randomly to allow investigators to conduct more detailed on-site surveys on these environmental parameters, including how often residents use air-conditioning to modify the indoor environment. Such a further study could also use the data from this SBS survey to conduct an empirical analysis of the relationship between SBS symptoms and the environmental parameters. The influences of some building characteristics, such as flat areas and window sizes, on the occurrence of SBS symptoms can be considered as well. This will contribute to a better understanding of home SBS and will have important implications for the design and management of residential buildings for sustainable development. Nevertheless, as sources of SBS are difficult to identify, the study showed that architects need to consider the symptoms of SBS when they design a perception-based IEQ questionnaire. Otherwise, they may be unable to account for some unobserved effects of SBS. It is hoped that this study will stimulate research on similar issues that pertain to health and the human habitat.",
