The CCoV genome is composed for about two-thirds of two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two polyproteins leading to the viral replicase formation. The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome consists of other ORFs encoding the structural proteins and the other non-structural ones. The structural proteins comprise the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins encoded by ORF2, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF6, respectively (Luytjes, 1995, Enjuanes et al., 2000).",

FCoV RNA is quantifiable by means of a fluorogenic RT-PCR assay (Gut et al., 1999). Analogously, a TaqMan RT-PCR assay for the specific detection and quantitation of CCoV RNA in the faeces of infected dogs has been established. This method is highly sensitive and reproducible, allowing several samples to be processed in a few hours, with a large increase in throughput. By using the established fluorogenic RT-PCR assay, it was possible to trace the course of natural and experimental infections in dogs (Decaro et al., 2004).",

Type I and type II are distinguishable by means of molecular methods, which are able to amplify selectively fragments of the ORF2 (S gene) and ORF5 (M gene) (Pratelli et al., 2002a, Pratelli et al., 2004), but no quantitative techniques have been developed which could differentiate the two genotypes. In addition, the established fluorogenic assay was able to detect both genotypes, although it tended to underestimate the viral load in dogs infected with type I, probably due to the presence of mismatches in the binding region of primers and probe (unpublished results). The simultaneous detection of both type I and type II in the faeces of pups with diarrhoea (Pratelli et al., 2004) has highlighted the need to establish genotype-specific fluorogenic RT-PCR assays, in order to obtain an exact quantitation of the two genotypes present in the same samples. Such a method would be helpful for understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of the newly recognized CCoV type I, since this virus has not yet been adapted to grow in vitro (Pratelli et al., 2003b, Pratelli et al., 2004).",

Assay target region was first identified by visual inspection of sequence alignment, and then exact primer and probe sequences, specific for type I or type II, were selected by using a primer design software (Beacon Designer, Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl). The probe specific for type I and that specific for type II presented at the 3\u2032 end the nucleotide triplet ACA or TGT, which is unique to each genotype (Pratelli et al., 2001b, Pratelli et al., 2002c, Pratelli et al., 2003a), leading us to predict a correct differentiation between the two genotypes. Both probes were labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032-end and with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3\u2032 end. Oligonucleotide synthesis was made by Applera Italia (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy). The position and sequence of the primers and probe used for TaqMan RT-PCR amplification are reported in Table 1\n.",

Both fluorogenic assays were found to be highly specific, sensitive and reproducible, allowing an accurate viral RNA quantitation over a linear range of about eight logs (from 101 to 108 RNA copies). However, the assays should be considered semi-quantitative rather than quantitative methods, since it is not possible to exactly determine and compare viral loads in dogs using faeces as samples. In fact, the total volume of faeces (and thus the volume into which the viruses are secreted or diluted) can hardly be determined and will vary between different dogs and between different periods of a diarrhoeic episode of one dog. In contrast with the high specificity of the two assays, TGEV was amplified successfully by the type II-specific fluorogenic assay. However, this finding should not affect the detection of CCoV type II in the faeces of dogs, since TGEV, even if able to replicate in the canine host (Larson et al., 1979), has never been reported, isolated or detected from the faeces of dogs.",

They enable simultaneous processing of a large number of samples, with a substantial increase in throughput and a considerable time saving. The only disadvantage related to real-time RT-PCR is represented by the higher costs, which consist of the cost of conventional RT-PCR plus the cost of the labelled probe. Nevertheless, the high throughput associated with the TaqMan assay compensates for this additional cost and permits processing of multiple samples with minimal labour time and very low risks of carry-over contamination. The performance of the IC added to the faecal samples demonstrated that the commercial kit used for nucleic acid extraction is highly efficient for the recover and purification of RNA.",

Several dogs were infected simultaneously by both type I and type II, showing that dual CCoV infections are very frequent in the dog population, as reported previously (Pratelli et al., 2004). Interestingly, type I was found more widespread in the dog population with respect to type II. An analogous distribution has been also described for feline coronaviruses, since FCoV type I is more frequently detected in cats than FCoV type II (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Benetka et al., 2004), although it grows poorly in cell cultures (Pedersen et al., 1984).",

Finally, vaccine trials against CCoV infections could also take advantage of the newly established fluorogenic assays for the evaluation of the vaccine efficacy by determining CCoV shedding in the faeces of vaccinated dogs after challenge with a field strain of type I or type II. In fact, by conventional RT-PCR only, the time duration of viral shedding is valuable, while evaluation of the vaccine efficacy should also take into account the reduction in the titres of the challenge virus in the faeces. Theoretically, CCoV type II titres in the faeces of challenged dogs could be evaluated by titration in cell culture, but it has been noted that this method is poorly sensitive and inaccurate (Decaro et al., 2004) and, further, virus titration cannot be used for CCoV type I which cannot be cultivated in cell culture.",
