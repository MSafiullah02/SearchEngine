            "text": "Affect refers to the \u201c\u2026 specific quality of \u2018goodness\u2019 or \u2018badness\u2019 (i) experienced as a feeling state \u2026 and (ii) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus\u201d (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2002, p. 329). Recently, Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, and Welch (2001) have distinguished between two types of emotion: anticipatory emotions (e.g., fear), which are immediate and visceral, and anticipated emotions (e.g., regret), which are expected to be experienced in the future (pp. 267\u2013268). As Loewenstein et al. (2001) observe, the bulk of the literature views affect as an anticipated emotion. Our approach implicitly invokes an anticipatory perspective on affect. We suggest that expectations are driven by the affect (induced by prior outcomes) that people are experiencing at the time they are judging expectations. Drawing on Schwarz and Clore\u2019s (1983) affect-as-information model, one can postulate a direct effect of affect according to which people who have recently experienced a positive (vs. negative) event might be more optimistic about a future event because they misattribute their positive feelings to the future event. Affect might also influence judgments indirectly by creating a \u201cwarm glow\u201d (Isen, 1970), which in turn makes mood-consistent information relatively more available, accessible, salient, memorable, and retrievable (Isen et al., 1978, Wright and Mischel, 1982). Therefore, a person who has experienced favorable outcomes that lead to positive affect may, when asked to predict the outcome of a future event, predict a favorable (positive) outcome because the current positive mood makes positive outcomes more available in memory.",

Wright and Mischel (1982) found that individuals\u2019 expectations of success in a pattern-recognition task were influenced by their immediate feeling state. Similarly, Brown (1984) found that participants in a negative affective state had lower expectations than those in a positive state, when making predictions about success at a concept formation problem. Further, Wright and Bower (1992) demonstrated that inducing affect (through an imagination exercise coupled with hypnosis) had the expected effect on subjective probability assessments of future events that were either personal or non-personal in nature. These results provide strong support for mood congruent effects on optimism and pessimism. Happy people tend to have a much rosier view of the future relative to unhappy people.",

Loss aversion, a core tenet of prospect theory, suggests that losses dominate gains (a premise captured by the relatively steep slope of the value function in the domain of losses resulting in outcomes in the domain of losses yielding a stronger effect on value perceptions than outcomes in the domain of gains). In other words, \u201cthe aggravation that one experiences in losing a sum of money appears to be greater than the pleasure associated with gaining the same amount\u201d (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p. 279).\n5 Put differently, the aggravation associated with the outright loss of a sum of money ought to be greater than that associated with the opportunity loss of not being able to gain the same amount. That is, a movement away from the origin in the domain of losses yields a relatively large change in value perceptions, while an equivalent movement towards the origin in the domain of gains yields a relatively small change in value perceptions (Nagle and Holden, 2002, Thaler, 1980). This view of opportunity costs is consistent with the perspective that \u201c\u2026 out-of-pocket costs are viewed as losses and opportunity costs are viewed as foregone gains, (thus) the former will be more heavily weighted\u201d (Thaler, 1980, p. 44).

Since the loss portion of the slope is steeper, for economically equivalent values, the difference in affect between cells C and D should be greater than that in affect between cells A and B. Therefore, we suggest a domain-contingent asymmetry for affect. Moreover, because of the link between affect and expectations (as discussed during our development of Hypothesis 1), we should find a similar domain-contingent asymmetry for expectations about future events. This leads to our second hypothesis, according to which the intensity of the effect predicted in Hypothesis 1 will depend on the domain of prior outcomes.Hypothesis 2Prior outcomes will have a stronger effect on expectation about a future outcome when prior outcomes are in the domain of losses, relative to when they are in the domain of gains.\n",

There is a 50% chance that the outcome of the investment will be positive and a 50% chance that it will be negative. For participants in the gains domain, gaining a million dollars was the positive outcome and not gaining anything was the negative outcome.

After they had read the case, subjects turned the page and read that a 50% likelihood of success was akin to a coin toss.

Half the subjects were in the \u201cHeads\u201d condition and the other half were in the \u201cTails\u201d condition.

We then develop the more nuanced argument that prior outcomes influence expectations differentially depending on the domain in which the prior outcomes occur (gains vs. losses); consistent with the principle of loss aversion, the effects are predicted to be stronger in the domain of losses. The results of two real money lotteries are supportive of our hypotheses. In a third study, we examine whether these differential expectations will translate into differences in preferences in risky choice settings.

(2001) discuss the influence of anticipated and anticipatory affect on judgment and decision-making. For instance, people might anticipate the affect they would experience following the outcome of a risky choice, and choose the option that they believe will make them feel better (Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, & Ritov, 1997). Similarly, as an anticipatory emotion, people might employ their current affect as a heuristic to make judgments (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000). Our findings are situated more in the anticipatory tradition. We suggest that the anticipatory affect evoked by prior outcomes varies with the domain of prior outcomes and influences expectations about the future to a greater degree in the domain of losses than in the domain of gains.",

This presumably happens because people feel they can integrate future outcomes with prior gains and losses (e.g., compensate earlier losses with the new outcome). By using different mental accounts (money and lives), we demonstrate that prior outcomes can influence decision-making even when no opportunity for integration exists. Our results suggest that the decision to choose a risky option depends not only on whether the outcome can be integrated with earlier gains or losses, but also on expectations about whether the risky option will pan out. If expectations indeed change based on prior outcomes (as we demonstrate), so should risk preferences. Preference for a risky option is going to be lower (relative to a risk-free option) if one becomes more pessimistic about the outcome.

Our research is consistent with this latter perspective. Recently experienced unfavorable events may lower expectations and depress the reference point. Consequently, when a favorable outcome occurs in the future, it may be even more enjoyable than if it had not been preceded by an unfavorable event.

This might reduce her willingness to pay for an extended warranty. Additionally, the frame in which the prior outcomes occurred would likely impact expectations of failure.

A field study within an organization could help understand the impact of prior events on managerial decision-making. For instance, investing behavior might depend on the outcome (positive vs. negative) as well as the domain (losses vs. gains) of prior unrelated investments. Similarly, one could try to understand whether the willingness to pay for a product can change based on the outcome of prior unrelated events. If expectations about a product\u2019s performance increase because prior unrelated events are positive, a consumer might be willing to pay more for the product. A related question of interest is whether enhanced pessimism (due to negative prior outcomes) leads to a willingness to pay to reduce risk, increasing the willingness to purchase and pay for extended warranties.",

Issues such as the risk of contracting SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) or being the victim of a terrorist attack have a huge impact on public behavior, despite the relatively small objective probabilities associated with these events. Our research suggests that the perceived chance of contracting SARS might be influenced by an unrelated event such as a prior terrorist attack.",
