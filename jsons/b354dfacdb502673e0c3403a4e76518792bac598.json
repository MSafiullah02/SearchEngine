Interestingly, patient 1 was negative for two consecutive nucleic acid tests but positive for serum antibodies (IgM 69.12 AU/ml). Only two patients had typical ground-glass imaging changes in lung CT ( Figure 1 ).

Three patients had elevated troponin I (TNI) in the later period, especially in patient 3 and 4, TNI increased significantly a few days before death. Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain natriuretic peptide of patient 3 and 4 were significantly higher than the rest two patients.
