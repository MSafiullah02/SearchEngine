Schl\u00f6gl I, also known as contact process [2], comprises the important case of simple contagion, i.e., the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model where healthy individuals can be infected due to the exposure to a single infectious source, eventually leading to the spread of an epidemic disease [2\u20135]. In contrast, Schl\u00f6gl II, also known as quadratic contact process [6], requires contact with two sources. Later studies on Schl\u00f6gl II sparked a debate on its critical behavior and Grassberger noticed in 1982 that a relation to the Ising universality class \u201cwould be a most remarkable extension of the universality hypothesis, from models with detailed balance to models without it\u201d to conclude that Schl\u00f6gl II \u201cis not an example of universality between models with and without detailed balance\u201d [7].",

The study of the model\u2019s mean-field critical behavior led the authors to conjecture that such general failure-recovery dynamics belong to the Ising universality class [9]. This model is of particular interest since it not only includes simple contagions but also complex contagion phenomena such as the diffusion of innovations [10,11], political mobilization [12], and viral marketing [13] that require social reinforcement, i.e., the connection to multiple sources [14,15]. The model displays an intricate and very rich dynamics including hysteresis effects, limit cycles, and cusp catastrophes [9,16\u201320]. Thus, a unifying mean-field theory of the critical behavior is essential for a broad range of dynamical systems.",

But, given the model\u2019s parameter regime, can we generally predict the dynamics type? And does the model\u2019s mean-field critical behavior belong to the Ising universality class or not? Here we answer these questions and analytically demonstrate that the mean-field critical behavior of the model is restricted to only three possible regimes: (a) uncorrelated spontaneous transition dynamics, (b) contact process dynamics, and (c) cusp catastrophes. Cusp catastrophes can display abrupt transitions and hysteresis effects\u2014phenomena that can harm the proper functioning of real-world networked systems since small variations in the system\u2019s control parameters may cause catastrophic transitions from a seemingly well-functioning state to global malfunction or severe outages [21\u201330].",

Three fundamental processes define the transitions between these two states [9,20]: (i) nodes undergo a spontaneous transition A\u2192X from an active (A) to an inactive state (X) in a time interval dt with probability pdt; (ii) if fewer than or equal to m nearest neighbors of a node are active, the node becomes inactive (Y) due to an induced transition, i.e., A\u2192Y, with probability rdt, and (iii) a spontaneous reverse transition with probability qdt if X\u2192A or probability q\u2032dt if Y\u2192A. The inactive states X and Y only differ in their reverse transitions and are equivalent if q=q\u2032. Process (ii) describes that a node with degree k can become inactive if its number of inactive neighbors is larger or equal to k-m. Similar to threshold models describing complex contagion phenomena, the threshold m defines the number of contacts to inactive nodes that is necessary to induce a transition as defined by process (ii) [14,31\u201333]. A low value of m corresponds to the situation where many inactive neighbors are required to sustain spreading. In contrast, for a large value of m only a few inactive neighbors can sustain the spreading process. Processes (i)\u2013(iii) are illustrated in Fig. 1.",

The total fraction of inactive nodes in the stationary state is referred to as ast. In accordance with Ref. [20] we derive the mean-field rate equations by assuming a system with homogeneous degrees in the thermodynamic limit that exhibits perfect mixing. Here, perfect mixing either refers to a network of randomly connected nodes with a sufficiently large mean degree or dynamical rewiring [3,34]. For the fraction of nodes that spontaneously became inactive we find u\u02d9spon=p(1-a)-quspon,(1)where the first term accounts for the fact that active nodes spontaneously become inactive with rate p [process (i)] and the second term corresponds to the spontaneous reverse transition with rate q [process (iii)].

Under the assumption of a perfectly mixed population, the probability that a node of degree k is located in such a neighborhood is Ek=\u2211j=0m(kk-j)ak-j(1-a)j\n[9,20]. The time evolution of the fraction of nodes that are inactive due to induced transitions is therefore given by u\u02d9ind=r\u2211kfkEk(1-a)-q\u2032uind,(2)with fk being the degree distribution. The first term describes the occurrence of induced transitions [process (ii)] with rate r of active nodes in a neighborhood where the number of active neighbors is smaller than or equal to m, whereas the second term accounts for the spontaneous reverse transition to an active state with rate q\u2032 [process (iii)]. In order to study the influence of different threshold values m on the mean-field critical behavior of Eqs.

We demonstrate below that the model defined by processes (i)\u2013(iii) can only exhibit three different regimes depending on the choice of m.

Inside this hysteresis region two stable fixed points coexist. Phase switching is observed when fluctuations in systems of finite size push the dynamics close to the unstable fixed point, cf., Fig. 2 (right). Between the switching events the dynamics remains in one of the two phases for some time. The waiting times thus depend on the fluctuation strength and the distance from one phase to the unstable state in the phase portrait, cf., Fig. 2 (right). For m<k-1 where either two or more inactive neighbors are necessary to induce a transition, we show that the corresponding metastable regions always exist due to the relation to cusp catastrophes [17]. For a detailed analytical treatment we refer the reader to Supplemental Material [35]. The cusp point where the two bifurcation lines intersect [cf., Fig. 3 (right)] is given by a0(k,m)=(k-1-m)/(k+1) together with the corresponding control parameters, r0(k,m)=1S(a0)+S\u2032(a0)(1-a0),(6)and p0(k,m)=S\u2032(a0)a0-S(a0)S(a0)+S\u2032(a0)(1-a0).(7)We illustrate the influence of different values of m on (r0,p0) and on the extent of the hysteresis area in Supplemental Material [35]. Studying Eq. (3) in the vicinity of (a0,r0,p0), i.e., setting a=a0+a\u02dc, r=r0+r\u02dc, p=p0+p\u02dc, yields for the Taylor expansion (omitted tilde) a\u02d9=rS(a0)+p(1-a0)+a[rS\u2032(a0)-p]+r06S\u2032\u2032\u2032(a0)a3.(8)We thus find by setting p or r to 0 respectively and solving for the fixed point of Eq. (8), a(r)=(-6S(a0)r0S\u2032\u2032\u2032(a0))1/3r1/3+O(r2/3),(9)a(p)=(-6(1-a0)r0S\u2032\u2032\u2032(a0))1/3p1/3+O(p2/3).(10)In previous work, the critical behavior at the cusp point of a regular random network (k=10 and m=4) has been conjectured to belong to the Ising universality class although by definition the dynamics corresponds to a general contact process [20].",

For m=k-1 the model recovers the critical behavior of the contact process. A cusp catastrophe is found for all m<k-1 with the typical critical behavior at the cusp point [Eqs. (9) and (10)].

This scenario typically implies dramatic and uncontrollable global transitions in the network for many systems involving complex contagion dynamics. One could naively expect that it could be beneficial for failure control to design systems such that a component only fails if many of its neighbors already failed, i.e., delaying the failure dynamics. Our results suggest, however, that this delaying procedure might facilitate uncontrollable transitions, hence achieving exactly the opposite as initially intended. This result agrees well with previous findings on delaying procedures that have been applied to a SIS model [44,45]. For low spatial dimensions or highly structured networks, the assumptions of perfect mixing or independent node-to-node interactions are not guaranteed. Still mean-field approximations qualitatively describe a given dynamics [3,4,46]; see examples given in Supplemental Material [35].",
