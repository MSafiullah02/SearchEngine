E. europaeus, protected by the Italian law 157/92 [3], is abundantly distributed throughout the Italian peninsula, in Sicily, in Sardinia and in some smaller islands, without any reported evidence of a rapid decline [4].",

They are mainly nocturnal and insectivorous, build nests and use hearing and smell as a dominant sense, and possess peculiar specializations such as spines and highly developed back muscles allowing them to roll up [5]. Hedgehogs\u2019 suitable habitats include natural open and green spaces as well as artificial, rural and urban, areas with marked preference for lowlands and hilly areas providing abundant food supply and plenty of grass, trees and fallen leaves. They also need diversity of habitats as those found in edges of deciduous woodlands or in man-made ecotonal interfaces (i.e., parks and garden with hedges) [6]. Despite its solitary lifestyle [7], E. europaeus has a highly variable home range, ranging in Italy from 5.5 to 102.5 ha [8]. As generalist predators of macro-invertebrates, hedgehogs consume most frequently caterpillars, earthworms, earwigs, slugs, millipedes and beetles (including coprophagous species); they may also eat meat (e.g., in the form of carrion or preyed small vertebrates such as mice, snakes and birds), bird eggs and pet food that is frequently found in gardens and shared with dogs and cats.",

Two of the four recognized genera of CoVs (i.e., Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus) are probably perpetuated in bat populations [13,14], recently recognized as the evolutionary origins of the MERS-CoV, emerged in 2012 in humans [15]. The recent detection of MERS-related CoVs in hedgehogs from Germany [16], France [17] and Great Britain [18] suggests that E. europaeus, which is belonging to a Chiroptera-related order [19], represents a wild reservoir of betacoronaviruses known as Erinaceus CoVs (EriCoVs).",

In the present study, an overall prevalence of EriCoV infection (58.3%) was detected in sampled hedgehogs with no significant difference between percentages found in rural (80%) and urban (52.6%) areas. Indeed, this may be associated with a sustained circulation of viruses in their wild recovery areas likely due to frequent and consistent overlaps of home ranges reported in this species [8]. The detected prevalence was higher than that observed by Saldanha et al. [18] in Great Britain (10.8%), but in accordance with data reported in Germany (58.9%) and France (50%), respectively [16,17]. From an epidemiological point of view, the high EriCov prevalence observed suggests that, in the study area, E. europaeus could play the role of natural reservoir, competent for infection, replication and excretion of this virus. Such high prevalence observed in this study also suggests that hedgehogs could represent chronic shedding carriers of the virus, as reported for alphacoronaviruses infecting bats [40] and cats [41]. It is also noteworthy that most of our samples were collected during a physiological phase of reduced immune function [42] that occurs during hedgehogs\u2019 hibernation period, consisting of four or five months of \u201cwinter dormancy\u201d in which these mammals may alternate phases of sleep and arousal [5].",
