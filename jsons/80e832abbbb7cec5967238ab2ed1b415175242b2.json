This chapter describes the pathologic features of acute and chronic rejection of the small airways (i.e., lymphocytic and obliterative bronchiolitis). As transbronchial lung biopsy is the mainstay for the assessment of rejection, a brief discussion of some of the limitations of this technique is provided from the pathologist's perspective. Several important and common entities that can mimic airway rejection are described with practical guidance for distinguishing these potential confounders on transbronchial biopsy. The nonrejection fi ndings that are discussed include the normal biopsy, nonspecifi c forms of chronic bronchiolitis, cytomegalovirus and pneumocystis pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia.",

The second, obliterative (or constrictive) bronchiolitis (OB), refers to partial or complete fi brous scarring of the distal airways and it is often, but not always, pauci-infl ammatory. The term \"obliterative bronchiolitis\" is preferred over the term \"bronchiolitis obliterans,\" so as not to confuse the former with the much more common bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP), also termed simply organizing pneumonia (OP), an unrelated disease process with different clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.",

While OB is perhaps best known as the central feature of chronic lung rejection, it may also occur in a number of non-transplant settings. Patients with connective tissue diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis, are perhaps the most commonly affected with OB outside of the transplant setting [ 2 ] . In addition, OB is an uncommon complication of various viral infections of the respiratory tract, particularly in children [ 3 , 4 ] , and is also a rare manifestation of medication toxicity (e.g., d -penicillamine ) [ 5 ] and inhalational injury from various toxins such as ammonia [ 6 ] , smoke [ 7 ] , and cocaine [ 8 ] . Recently, OB has been described as an occupational lung disorder of microwave popcorn workers (possibly related to diacetyl exposure, a butter-fl avoring agent) [ 9 , 10 ] . OB is also a manifestation of graft-versus-host-disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients [ 11 ] . Interestingly, lesions histologically identical to LB have been observed in some of these conditions [ 11 -13 ] , providing a putative link between LB and OB. Indeed, LB is now widely accepted as not only a bona fi de manifestation of acute rejection, but as an important risk factor for developing chronic airway rejection.",

            "text": "Lymphocytic and obliterative bronchiolitis are part of the formal histologic classifi cation system of lung rejection, developed by the Lung Rejection Study Group of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). The classifi cation system is published as an ongoing series of working papers in order to maintain up-to-date and standardized nomenclature, and it has undergone two major revisions since the original working formulation was published in 1990 [ 19 -21 ] . These changes refl ect a combination of advances in the fi eld of transplant rejection, experience with the application of the earlier grading schemes, and consensus expert opinion. The current ISHLT Working Formulation [ 21 ] recommends histologic assessment of rejection along four lines: Grade A for perivascular infl ammation (acute cellular rejection [ACR]), Grade B for airway infl ammation (lymphocytic bronchiolitis), Grade C for airway fi brosis (obliterative bronchiolitis), and Grade D for chronic vascular rejection (graft atherosclerosis). ACR is graded on the severity and density of perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infl ammation in the following manner: A0, no perivascular infi ltrates; A1, minimal acute rejection; A2, mild acute rejection; A3, moderate acute rejection; and A4, severe acute rejection. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is graded as: B0, no airway infl ammation; B1R, low-grade airway infl ammation; and B2R, high-grade airway infl ammation. Constrictive bronchiolitis and chronic vascular rejection are not graded but are designated as being either absent (C0 and D0) or present (C1 and D1). Because bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) is the mainstay for assessment of lung rejection, the classifi cation system includes an \"ungradeable\" score for each parameter, designated by an X after the letter (e.g., AX), if it cannot be assessed in the sample. This refl ects the limitations arising from the necessarily limited amount of tissue obtainable with TBBx, the patchiness of the histologic fi ndings in graft rejection, and potential confounding factors, particularly concomitant infection. This classifi cation system can also be applied to larger specimens, such as surgical lung biopsies, explanted allografts, and autopsy material, with the recognition that some fi ndings, especially chronic vascular rejection (Grade D), are relatively uncommon and virtually never identifi ed on TBBx. ACR and graft atherosclerosis will not be further discussed as they are beyond the scope of this chapter. The interested reader will fi nd a good discussion of these topics elsewhere [ 21 -23 ] .",

In addition to rejection, the lung transplant patient is at greater risk for a variety of insults that manifest predominantly, both clinically and pathologically, as airway or airway-based abnormalities. Most importantly, this includes opportunistic infections. BOOP and aspiration pneumonia also occur more commonly in transplanted patients and are sometimes overlooked as potential causes of allograft dysfunction. We will also briefl y review two entities that may be mistaken for rejection by the pathologist-the normal biopsy and nonspecifi c forms of chronic bronchiolitis. First however, given the central role that TBBx plays in the management of rejection, we will briefl y review the limitations of TBBx, from the perspective of the pathologist.",

Like any procedure TBBx has intrinsic benefi ts and costs; it is not our intention to enter into the debate regarding the most appropriate role for TBBx. Our focus is instead on the histopathologic fi ndings that facilitate accurate and timely diagnosis in lung transplant patients. Accurate interpretation of TBBx performed for rejection can be challenging for two main reasons. The fi rst, which is common to currently available techniques for retrieving lung tissue with TBBx, stems from the small size and necessarily limited amount of tissue obtainable via the fl exible bronchoscope. The second, which is unique to lung transplant patients, is the difficulty in separating bona fi de rejection from other processes with a similar appearance. These potential confounders are discussed in greater detail in the latter sections of this chapter.",

            "text": "There is an inherent challenge in interpreting small pieces of tissue that may be crushed or torn. In addition, small pieces of tissue are more diffi cult to interpret due to problems stemming from oblique (or tangential) sectioning. This is unavoidable in TBBx. However, the problem of limited tissue is ameliorated, to a degree, by the goal for \"adequacy\" in rejection TBBx. The ISHLT recommends that adequate biopsy tissue sampling consists of at least fi ve pieces of alveolated parenchyma, recognizing that the bronchoscopist may need to submit more pieces than this in order to increase the chances of including histologically assessable bronchioles within the submitted sample. Moreover, the bronchoscopist may need to submit more than fi ve pieces as some, and sometimes all, of the submitted pieces are invariably comprised only of bronchial wall, exfoliated epithelium, and/or blood (see Fig. 2 .1 ). As mentioned above, rejection is a histologically patchy phenomenon. While higher grades of acute rejection are, by defi nition, more diffuse processes, lower grades of rejection, including grade A2 (the traditional clinical threshold for pulse therapy), can still be very patchy. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that episodes of even minimal acute rejection or low-grade LB are associated with higher subsequent rates of chronic rejection/BOS [ 26 ] . Therefore, obtaining adequate biopsies may be expected to increase the diagnostic yield of TBBx and allow clinicians to appropriately treat an acute rejection episode in patients who would have otherwise gone untreated.",

The diagnostic yield of TBBx is the percentage of biopsies performed that are \"positive\" for rejection. Comparing experiences between centers is challenging, in part, because positivity is not uniformly defi ned. Some have defi ned as \"positive\" any biopsy with at least grade A1 rejection, while others defi ne as Comparing an adequate ( a ) and a suboptimal ( b ) transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) at low magnifi cation (hematoxylin and eosin, original magnifi cation \u00d720). The TBBx in ( a ) is very generous and contains about eight substantial fragments of alveolated parenchyma. Both large and small airways are well represented (although diffi cult to discern at this magnifi cation). By comparison, the TBBx in ( b ) is unsuitable for assessment of rejection. While it consists of about fi ve fragments of tissue, only three are adequately alveolated. However, even these are small, torn, and show signifi cant crush by the forceps. The other fragments are crushed bronchial wall, blood, and exfoliated epithelium, which are not useful for a meaningful histological assessment. The biopsy in (a) obviously provides much more information and is also easier to interpret \"positive\" biopsies having at least grade A2 rejection, any form or grade of rejection (whether types A, B, or C), and even infection. Diagnostic yield also will vary depending on whether a TBBx is performed for clinical indications or surveillance. Given this variability, diagnostic yield is best understood as an institution-specifi c parameter and is perhaps most useful as a measure of quality control and improvement. By contrast, sensitivity of rejection TBBx is defi ned in a standard fashion, which is the fraction of patients with a disease (transplant rejection) who have the disease (rejection) on testing (TBBx). The numerator (i.e., number of patients with rejection on TBBx) is the same whether measuring diagnostic yield or sensitivity, but the denominator is different ( yield = number of patients tested; sensitivity = number of patients with rejection). The sensitivity of TBBx varies with the number of pieces obtained. Earlier studies utilizing transplanted animals that were sacrifi ced [ 27 ] showed that fi ve pieces of lung tissue were required to achieve a sensitivity of 92 % for the detection of at least mild rejection. In contrast, a study of 219 TBBx from 54 heart-lung transplant recipients by Scott et al. [ 28 ] showed that in the clinical setting 18 samples per procedure may be necessary to have a 95 % confi dence of fi nding rejection.",

In a study of 48 open lung biopsies performed on 42 lung transplant patients from an institution performing surveillance TBBx [ 31 ] , a clinically unsuspected diagnosis was made in 14 (29 %) of the 48 biopsies, all of which resulted in changes to patient treatment.

In other levels, the bronchiolar epithelium was necrotic and denuded A great deal of basic science, animal model, and clinical research has begun to clarify the pathogenesis of OB and the risk factors predisposing to it [ 15 , 16 ] . Both ACR and LB are well-established risk factors. Non-immunologic risk factors, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and non-CMV infection, BOOP, donor age, and graft ischemia time (among others), have also been implicated as risk factors for developing OB/BOS. Recently, there has been increasing attention on the existence and possible role for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) as a risk factor for OB/BOS [ 32 ] . This stems from the occurrence of OB in patients with no evidence of antecedent ACR [ 33 ] , evidence of septal capillary injury in cases of otherwise unexplained graft dysfunction [ 34 ] , complement deposition in capillary endothelium [ 35 ] , and the uncommon but well-documented occurrence of graft dysfunction in patients who developed donor-specifi c anti-human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) antibodies and capillaritis on biopsy [ 36 ] . Despite tantalizing evidence of a possible link between AMR and lung allograft dysfunction there are persistent unresolved questions regarding its diagnosis and signifi cance. Capillaritis has been proposed as a histologic marker of AMR in TBBx but distinguishing capillaritis from simple neutrophil margination (diapedesis) in small specimens is challenging at best. Bronchopneumonia must be rigorously excluded in this setting since neutrophil margination is common in acute infection. In the nontransplant setting necrotizing capillaritis is virtually always associated with clinical and histologic evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical stains for C4d are of limited value given that interpretation is plagued by nonspecifi c background staining of endothelial cells and elastic tissue. Furthermore, there is a poor correlation between linear C4d staining, the presence of necrotizing capillaritis, and the development of donor-specifi c HLA alloantibodies [ 37 ] . Thus, substantial diffi culties remain before AMR can be embraced as a distinct clinicopathologic form of lung rejection.",

The signifi cance of LB with respect to lung rejection is now well established. Occasionally, similar appearing infl ammation of the large conducting cartilaginous airways may also occur, with or without associated LB [ 38 ] . Unlike LB, much less is known about the signifi cance of isolated large airway infl ammation vis\u00e0-vis rejection. Early studies found increased numbers of specialized Leu-7 (CD57)positive T lymphocytes in the mucosa of donor bronchi with morphologic evidence of airway injury and observed an association between lymphocytic bronchitis and subsequent OB [ 39 -41 ] . In another study, Yousem and colleagues also found that \"chronic infl ammation of the bronchi\" was associated with subsequent development of OB, with a sensitivity and specifi city of 83 % and 100 %, respectively, although the number of cases was very small [ 42 ] . Large airway bronchial fi brosis has also been observed in some lung allografts with coexisting OB [ 43 ] . These studies suggested that bronchial mucosa may be a target for rejection prompting the use of the combined term \"lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis\" (LBB) to refer to the mononuclear cell infi ltrates jointly affecting the bronchi and the bronchioles. As is true in small airways, infl ammation in large airways is not specifi c for rejection and is commonly present with clinical (or subclinical) infection, aspiration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other inhalational injuries. Indeed, the ISHLT working formulation recognizes that large airway infl ammation is most commonly associated with infection and aspiration and does not currently identify or grade \"lymphocytic bronchitis\" as such [ 21 ] .

In particular, two important opportunistic pathogens, CMV and Pneumocystis jirovecii , cause an infectious pneumonia that may show prominent chronic interstitial infl ammation (i.e., chronic interstitial pneumonia) that closely resembles acute rejection [ 49 , 50 ] . In a study of CMV and pneumocystis pneumonia diagnosed by open lung biopsy and TBBx, Tazelaar [ 50 ] noted perivascular lymphocytic infi ltrates similar to those seen in acute rejection in 42 % of CMV cases and 21 % of pneumocystis cases. Such results reiterate the need for the pathologist to at least consider the possibility of infection in every transplant TBBx and to rigorously exclude-or include-infection with ancillary special stains in selected cases. A TBBx diagnosis of infection that includes perivascular lymphoid infi ltrates does not preclude the possibility of concomitant rejection, however, and should be regarded as indeterminate (\"AXBX\") in this regard. If clinically warranted, a subsequent TBBx following appropriate antimicrobial treatment may be more helpful in evaluating for rejection without the confounding effects of infection. This serves as a reminder that the ultimate diagnosis in any individual patient should be the result of integration with all available clinical data, including those from microbiologic and serologic studies.",

Cellular and nuclear enlargement (cytomegaly) is perhaps the most easily recognizable alteration. The intranuclear inclusions consist of centrally placed amorphous basophilic inclusions, usually with a clear halo separating them from the nuclear membrane. The cytoplasmic inclusions, which are not seen in every infected cell, are also basophilic and coarsely granular. The latter often stain positively with the Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) method. These viral cytopathic changes can affect virtually any cell, including pneumocytes, interstitial cells, and endothelial cells. While some cases may show numerous CMV virocytes, other cases may show only a few or rare infected cells, particularly in the limited samples that TBBx provides. An immunohistochemical stain for CMV is widely available and can be very helpful in confi rming the diagnosis, especially in subtle cases. In addition to the characteristic altered cells, CMV pneumonia typically elicits a predominantly chronic infl ammatory cell reaction involving the interstitium and the airways that may be nearly indistinguishable from ACR and LB. In more severe cases, it may also cause diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and/or fi brinous airspace exudate.",

The granulomas typically elicit an associated BOOP response, which is often quite prominent and is sometimes the dominant fi nding. Acute and chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis are a nearly constant fi nding and thus the pathologist must take care before ascribing bronchiolitis to rejection or to infection. The defi ning feature of aspiration pneumonia is the presence of exogenous aspirated foreign material, either in an extracellular location or within giant cells or both. The aspirated material is of two major kinds-foodstuffs and inorganic crystalline \"fi llers\" derived from oral medications; the presence of either substance in the appropriate histologic context is diagnostic. The foodstuffs have a varying appearance depending on the age of the process. They include recognizable skeletal muscle and plant cell walls derived from consumed meats and vegetables, respectively; the latter may be refractile and either weakly or strongly birefringent on polarized microscopy. Older organic material tends to have a pale, amorphous eosinophilic appearance, and is more diffi cult to recognize. The most common inorganic fi llers include microcrystalline cellulose, which is strongly birefringent, and crospovidone, which has an amorphous densely basophilic appearance. These exogenous compounds must not be confused with various endogenous materials that can be found within giant cells, including blue bodies, asteroid bodies, and birefringent calcium salts.

If suppurative granulomas are present in a TBBx, this should prompt the pathologist to search carefully for any associated exogenous aspirated substances. Occasionally, no aspirated material can be found, a problem more common in small biopsies, and a confi dent diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia may not be possible. In immunocompromised patients the differential diagnosis for otherwise unexplained granulomatous infl ammation includes mainly opportunistic infections and should prompt appropriate special stains and microbiological assays.
