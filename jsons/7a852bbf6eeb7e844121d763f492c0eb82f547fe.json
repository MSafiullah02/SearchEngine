Recent evidence suggests that surface TLR2 may also contribute to viral detection through recognition of viral coat proteins but its role in the outcome of acute viral infection remains elusive. In this study, we examined in vivo the role of TLR2 in acute infections induced by the highly hepatotrophic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) type 3 and weakly hepatotrophic MHV-A59 serotype. To address this, C57BL/6 (wild-type; WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) groups of mice were intraperitoneally infected with MHV3 or MHV-A59. MHV3 infection provoked a fulminant hepatitis in WT mice, characterized by early mortality and high alanine and aspartate transaminase levels, histopathological lesions and viral replication whereas infection of TLR2 KO mice was markedly less severe. MHV-A59 provoked a comparable mild and subclinical hepatitis in WT and TLR2 KO mice. MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis in WT mice correlated with higher hepatic expression of interferon-b, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-a, CXCL1, CCL2, CXCL10 and alarmin (interleukin-33) than in MHV-A59-infected WT mice and in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice. Intrahepatic recruited neutrophils, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells or macrophages rapidly decreased in MHV3-infected WT mice whereas they were sustained in MHV-A59infected WT mice and MHV3-infected TLR2 KO. MHV3 in vitro infection of macrophagic cells induced rapid and higher viral replication and/or interleukin-6 induction in comparison to MHV-A59, and depended on viral activation of TLR2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Taken together, these results support a new aggravating inflammatory role for TLR2 in MHV3-induced acute fulminant hepatitis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Surface or endosomal toll-like receptors (TLR) are key pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of infectious microorganisms in innate immunity. Host immune recognition of viruses during infections relies mainly on a combination of endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR3, -7/ 8, -9) and cytosolic helicases retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-1) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA-5) that sense viral RNA or DNA and trigger signalling pathways leading to inflammatory cytokines, Increasing evidence has shown that surface TLRs, such as TLR2 or TLR4, may also trigger acute inflammatory responses against viral infections through recognition of viral coat or core proteins. [2] [3] [4] [5] Activation of surface TLRdependent signalling pathways leads to the production of various chemokines involved in the recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, neutrophils and B-and T-cell subsets (reviewed in ref. 5) . Higher expression of TLR2 and/or TLR4 and up-regulation of inflammatory factors have been observed in macrophages in vitro infected by some viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 6-8 influenza virus, 9 hepatitis C virus (HCV), 4 hepatitis B virus (HBV), 10 severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 11 and several herpes viruses. [12] [13] [14] TLR2 and/or TLR4 have also been involved in the induction of high inflammatory responses during acute viral infections. Indeed, TLR2 and TLR4 increase the susceptibility to rotavirus infections in infants 15 and TLR2 was suggested as an aggravating inflammatory factor in herpes virus infections. 12, 14 Recent studies have also reported an over-expression of TLR2 in the liver and on monocytes from HCV-or HCV/HIV-infected patients correlating with hepatic inflammation and damages, suggesting a role for TLR2 in hepatitis-associated inflammation. 16, 17 HCV and HBV infections present subclinical to severe acute-phase patterns that may lead to viral clearance or evolve towards chronic infections (reviewed in ref. 18) . For reasons that are not well understood, few cases of acute infections progress into fulminant hepatic failure, characterized by extensive necrosis and hepatocellular dysfunction, exacerbated inflammation and high mortality rate. 19 Hepatic lesions occurring during viral infections are primarily related to virally triggered host inflammatory responses (reviewed in ref. 20) and depend on a poorly elucidated balance between innate immune cell-virus interactions and the control of viral replication that is critical in the outcome of hepatitis.

In the livers from MHV3-but not MHV-A59-infected WT mice, we have observed greater expression of TLR2 over other PRRs such as TLR3, RIG-1, MDA-5 or TLR4 and TR7, suggesting that MHV3 preferentially activates TLR2 transcription. Higher expression of TLR2 has been recently associated with disease progression of hepatitis C. 44 Levels of hepatic inflammation in HCV-and HCV/HIV-infected patients, also correlated with higher transcription of TLR2 and TLR4 genes in the liver 17 suggesting a proinflammatory role for TLR2 in hepatitis. Accordingly, blocking of TLR2 was recently shown to attenuate Concanavalin A-induced experimental hepatitis in mice. 45 We have observed fewer hepatic lesions, less viral replication and lower inflammatory responses in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice, indicating that TLR2 may act as an aggravating factor in fulminant hepatitis. However, TLR2 KO mice were not protected from MHV3-induced lethal hepatitis, but survival was significantly improved due to delayed occurrence of hepatic necrosis (observations not shown), supporting that other TLR2-independent mechanisms are also involved in the outcome of MHV3 infection.

We have observed that TNF-a and IL-6 increased sooner and more in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice than in TLR2 KO or MHV-A59-infected mice. It was previously reported that TNF-a activity significantly increases as soon as 24 hr p.i. during MHV3 infection, even before the virus is detectable in the liver, 47 supporting an early activation through an unidentified signalling pathway. Following i.p. infection, MHV3 primarily replicates in peritoneal macrophages and then within liver Kupffer cells and LSECs. 48, 49 A role for macrophages in MHV3-induced TLR2-dependent inflammatory responses is supported by in vitro infections. Our results indicate that both CEACAM1a and TLR2 are involved in viral replication and early IL-6 expression (as soon as 5 hr p.i.) in macrophages. Jacques et al. 34 have previously demonstrated that TLR2 and heparan sulphate were involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines in MHV3-infected macrophages. Our results suggest that higher and earlier TLR2-dependent IL-6 induction by MHV3 may be related to higher and earlier activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by the virus. In addition, since a very early role for the p38 MAPK pathway (within 30 min) was reported in viral replication of MHV3 in J774.1 macrophages, 50 higher and earlier replication of MHV3 than MHV-A59 may also result from differential activation of this pathway by the viruses. No role for TLR2, however, was reported in viral replication and induction of IL-6 by MHV-A59. 43 ,51 Such a difference may explain the lower viral load and inflammatory responses in the liver of MHV-A59-infected mice. In addition, preliminary data have shown that UV-inactivated MHV3 viral particles bound more rapidly to macrophage surface (<10 min) than UV-inactivated MHV-A59, suggesting that S protein from MHV3 may express higher affinity for TLR2 than MHV-A59. Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal hepatic cells were also reported to express both the viral receptor CEA-CAM1a 26 and TLR2. 52, 53 In vitro MHV3 infection in hepatocytes leads to rapid cell death (less than 24 hr p.i.) and low viral infectious titres and inflammatory cytokine levels, which are barely influenced by siTLR2 treatments (results not shown), suggesting that the exacerbated inflammatory response in the liver of MHV3-infected mice does not mostly depend on infected hepatocytes, in spite of extensive necrosis foci. Vascular and tolerant properties of LSECs, however, were disturbed when in vitro infected with MHV3 (Bleau et al. manuscript in revision). Hence, we can hypothesize that TLR2 fixation of viral infectious particles or free viral S proteins on MHV3 permissive cells, such as Kupffer cells and LSECs, may favour both viral replication and exacerbated inflammatory responses that may contribute to higher liver injury in MHV3-infected mice. Indeed, high levels of TNF-a in the liver are generally associated with extensive necrosis, 54 and absence of TNF-a, but not IL-6, was recently shown to significantly reduce hepatic lesions (AST/ALT) and increase the survival of MHV3-infected mice. 55 Following viral replication in macrophages and LSECs, viruses reach hepatocytes leading to rapid extensive syncytia and cell lysis. 28 The fulminance of liver lesions indicates that innate antiviral mechanisms cannot control viral infection and inflammatory responses. Type I IFN production by infected cells is the most important antiviral mechanism acting in the first days of infection. Higher IFN-b production, however, was found in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice than TLR2 KO mice or MHV-A59-infected WT mice. The positive correlation between IFN-b production and viral replication levels may reflect the spreading of viral replication in the liver rather than the efficiency of antiviral effects. Indeed, it was already reported that higher levels of type I IFN were produced simultaneously with higher MHV3 titres by peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice, 56 supporting a negligible role of type I IFN in the control of MHV3 replication. Such explanation is also supported by a positive correlation between low levels of IFN-b and low viral replication in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice or MHV-A59-infected WT mice, indicating that lower viral replication does not result from higher production of antiviral IFN-b. In addition, no significant IFN-a expression was induced in the liver of all infected groups of mice (results not shown), indicating no major role for type I IFN in the control of MHV replication and hepatitis. In addition, type I IFN response in mouse coronavirus infections depends mainly on TLR3 and helicases RIG-1 or MDA-5 engagement by viral RNAs. [57] [58] [59] Transcription levels of TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA-5 were comparable in livers from both MHV3infected WT and TLR2 KO mice and less transcribed in MHV-A59-infected WT mice, suggesting that higher induction of IFN-b by MHV3 infection did not depend on these PRRs. We can therefore postulate that higher levels of IFN-b in the livers of MHV3-infected WT mice may result from extensive hepatic infection and/or TLR2 engagement by MHV3. Indeed, Dietrich et al. 42 have demonstrated that translocation of TLR2 in endolysosomal compartments following ligand engagement can trigger IFN-b production via the MyD88/interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1/IRF-7-dependent pathway in macrophages. Preliminary data revealed increased expression of IRF-7 in livers from MHV3-infected WT mice, suggesting activation of this signalling pathway in some hepatic cells. Future work should address this hypothesis. Nevertheless, such an interesting potential new role for TLR2 in IFN-b regulation may not be of major importance in MHV3 infection as no protection against hepatitis seems to be provided by high IFN-b levels.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 233, "text": "46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 545, "end": 547, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 748, "end": 751, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 752, "end": 754, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1034, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1495, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1722, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2216, "end": 2219, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2222, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3150, "end": 3152, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3309, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 3442, "end": 3444, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4180, "end": 4182, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4889, "end": 4893, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4894, "end": 4898, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 4899, "end": 4903, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 5353, "end": 5355, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "TLR2 activation also leads to production of chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. Earlier and higher production of CXCL1, CCL2 and CXCL10, as seen in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice, may involve rapid recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and NK or T-cell subsets, respectively (reviewed in ref. 40) . As expected, CXCL1 production and concomitant neutrophil recruitment occurred sooner in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice, suggesting that increase in neutrophils may result from early CXCL1 release, as demonstrated by Moles et al. 39 The subsequent loss of neutrophils at 48 hr p.i., however, did not depend on a decrease of CXCL1 production because levels increased up to 72 hr p.i. We can hypothesize that recruited neutrophils may serve as a new cell target for viral infection leading to cell apoptosis, such as previously demonstrated for NK cells. 60 Work is in progress to clarify the loss of these cells during MHV3 infection. Our data regarding neutrophils slightly differ from those of Xu et al. 61 who reported percentage increases of neutrophils up to 48 hr p.i in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. Such apparent discrepancy results from the dramatic decrease in total intrahepatic MNCs, including NK, B and CD4 cells, leading to an apparent increase in neutrophil percentages in spite of a reduction in their absolute number, such as is demonstrated in the present work. These authors also linked neutrophil infiltration to a TNF-a-dependent Fgl-2 production. Our results do not support this hypothesis as chemokine production and neutrophil infiltration in the liver occurred earlier than Fgl-2 induction in MHV3infected WT mice. Total counts of MNCs in the livers of both MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice and MHV-A59infected WT mice were not highly altered over infection time and neutrophil numbers steadily increased up to 48 hr p.i. supporting a recruitment of these cells despite lower levels of CXCL1. The delayed and preserved neutrophil pool may therefore favour viral clearance and contribute to controlling acute hepatitis, as suggested by lower viral titres, inflammation and damages in these mice. Recent work regarding the respiratory rat coronavirus infection showed that neutrophils were required for an effective antiviral response but could also contribute to lung pathology. 62 On the other hand, we cannot exclude that higher levels of chemokines in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice may also contribute to hepatotoxicity without respect to neutrophil infiltration. 63 We have similarly observed lower macrophage recruitment in the livers of MHV3-infected WT mice than MHV3-infected TLR2 KO and MHV-A59-infected WT mice despite higher production of CCL2. It was previously demonstrated that macrophage expansion in the liver is related to influx of peripheral monocytes facilitated by high levels of CCL2 rather than to increase of Kupffer cells 64 (reviewed in ref. 65 ). However, resident and recruited macrophages are permissive to MHV3 infection 48, 49 and we have shown that viral replication in macrophages is increased by TLR2, suggesting that low number of macrophages in the livers of MHV3-infected WT mice result from higher viral replication and subsequent cell lysis. Accordingly, the low presence of inflammatory cells in necrosis foci observed in livers from MHV3-infected WT mice may result from virus-induced cell lysis of recruited MNCs. Lower levels of CXCL-1 and CCL2 in the livers of MHV3-infected TLR2 KO and MHV-A59-infected WT mice involved lower but sustained recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting that these cells might be protective rather than deleterious in acute hepatitis process. In agreement, depletion of macrophages in MHV-A59-infected mice has been shown to promote lethal fulminant hepatitis within 4 days p.i. 23 In addition, NK, NK-T, B and T lymphocytes decreased only in the liver of MHV3-infected WT mice despite higher levels of CXCL10. Such a reduction may result directly from permissivity of NK and B cells to viral infection, and indirectly from virally induced lysis of thymic dendritic cells, as was previously reported. 60, 66, 67 The larger inflammatory foci observed in the livers of MHV-A59-infected WT mice and MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice may therefore reflect the sustained recruitment of MNCs.

Activation of surface TLR signalling pathways has been recently \u00aa 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Immunology, 149, 204-224 associated with pathogenic processes in several viral infections. Indeed, TLR2 and/or TLR4 are involved in the induction of inflammatory response in severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, several herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus 1, varicella virus, cytomegalovirus), influenza, HIV, HBV and HCV infections. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In most cases, TLR2promoted inflammatory TNF-a, IL-6 or chemokine IL-8 responses are mediated by macrophages. 6, 7, 12, 13, 17 The viral mechanisms involved in the activation of TLR2 inflammatory pathways are not clearly elucidated. The ability of MHV3 viral proteins to bind and activate TLR2 signalling is not unique to coronaviruses. Indeed, HBV and HCV core proteins were reported to induce TLR2dependent activation of nuclear factor-jB and p38 MAPK and subsequent production of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 in macrophages. 3, 71 Hence, one could presume that activation of TLR2 by HCV/HBV core proteins could aggravate hepatic inflammation and damage. In agreement with this hypothesis, an up-regulation of TLR2 in the liver and on monocytes, correlating with higher TNF-a levels and necroinflammatory activity in the liver, was reported in patients with hepatitis C. 16, 17 Our data demonstrate for the first time that up-regulating the inflammatory activity of TLR2 in the acute phase of viral hepatitis favours fulminant hepatitis. In humans, fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is an uncommon clinical condition characterized by extensive hepatic necrosis, severe impairment of liver function and a high mortality rate. 19 The most recognized causal agents of FHF are hepatitis viruses (especially HBV) but several non-hepatic herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and varicella virus) and drugs were also associated with FHF. 19 The pathophysiology of FHF is unclear but increasing evidence suggests that regardless of the aetiological cause of FHF, the host's inflammatory response contributes to liver microcirculatory disorders and injury. Accordingly, macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokines were shown to play a key role in FHF. 72, 73 Moreover, the core protein from HBV was suggested as a potential initiating factor in patients with fulminant hepatitis B but mechanisms are still elusive. 74, 75 Hence, we can propose that strong TLR2dependent activation of macrophages in the liver by viral proteins from hepatitis or non-hepatitis viruses during acute infection may predispose to FHF induction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 863, "end": 866, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 884, "end": 888, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 894, "end": 898, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1016, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1019, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1023, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1027, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1030, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1427, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1430, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1773, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1776, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2124, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2346, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2664, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2665, "end": 2667, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2824, "end": 2827, "text": "74,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2828, "end": 2830, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Work is in progress to further determine the mechanisms involved in TLR2-dependent increase of inflammatory responses and viral replication in infected intrahepatic resident and recruited cell populations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article: Figure S1 .
