            "text": "Background Typhoid fever incidence and complications, including intestinal perforation, have declined significantly in high-income countries, with mortality rates \\1%. However, an estimated 10.9 million cases still occur annually, most in low-and middle-income countries. With the availability of a new typhoid conjugate vaccine licensed for children and recommended by the World Health Organization, understanding severe complications, including associated mortality rates, is essential to inform country-level decisions on introduction of this vaccine. This scoping review summarizes over 20 years of the literature on typhoid intestinal perforation in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We searched EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases for studies reporting mortality rates due to typhoid intestinal perforation in children, under 18 years old, in sub-Saharan Africa published from January 1995 through June 2019. Results Twenty-four papers from six countries were included. Reported mortality rates ranged from 4.6-75%, with 16 of the 24 studies between 11 and 30%. Thirteen papers included postoperative morbidity rates, ranging from 16-100%. The most documented complications included surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, and enterocutaneous fistulas. High mortality rates can be attributed to late presentation to tertiary centers, sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities requiring preoperative resuscitation, prolonged perforation-to-surgery interval, and lack of access to critical care or an intensive care unit postoperatively. Conclusions Current estimates of mortality related to typhoid intestinal perforation among children in sub-Saharan Africa remain unacceptably high. Prevention of typhoid fever is essential to reduce mortality, with the ultimate goal of a comprehensive approach that utilizes vaccination, improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene, and greater access to surgical care.",

Typhi), from either an acutely infected person or a chronic carrier [1] . Children are disproportionately affected with increased incidence seen between 5 and 14 years of age [2] . Over the past century, public health efforts, including improved sanitation infrastructure, access to clean water, and availability of effective antibiotics, have contributed to the decline of typhoid fever incidence and complications, including intestinal perforation, in high-income countries [2, 3] . In the USA, there were an estimated 350 cases of typhoid fever annually from 2008 to 2015, with an associated mortality rate of less than 1% [4] . The majority of these cases were due to travelers from endemic areas [1] . In comparison, typhoid fever continues to be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, especially in pediatric populations, where incidence peaks in children five to nine years of age [5] .",

In addition, TIP occurs more often in children, with increased mortality rates when compared to adults [7] .

Since 1990, mortality rates in some endemic areas have decreased to between 3 to 13% in Pakistan [11, 12] , Nepal [13] , and Iraq [14] , with a study from Turkey reporting a rate of 4.8% in children [15] .

Other currently available vaccines have limited duration of protection and are only recommended for children two years of age and older, making it difficult to incorporate these vaccines into the routine immunization schedule [16] . Importantly, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), committed to co-finance the TCV in eligible countries, the majority of which are located in sub-Saharan Africa [17, 18] . In order to assess the full impact of this vaccine and help inform country decisions on introduction, understanding severe complications is essential. The last mortality-focused review of TIP worldwide was published in 1994 and included all ages [19] . As a review of TIP specific to children living in sub-Saharan Africa has not been done, current mortality rates are unknown. For these reasons, we conducted a scoping review to obtain mortality rates due to TIP in children, under 18 years of age, living in sub-Saharan Africa, in order to summarize and update the field and to identify gaps in current knowledge.",

From 1984 to 2018, mortality rates ranged from 4.6 to 75%. In the data available since 2000, 79% of the reported mortality rates were between 10 and 30%. Although these numbers are moving in the right direction, they are still unacceptably high. In a tertiary care hospital in Ghana, the mortality rates for the two included studies did not change over a 10-year period, remaining just over 12% [25, 27] . Due to limited data, only one paper each from the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Niger was included, making it impossible to determine temporal trends. The cities of Enugu, Ibadan, Ife, and Ilorin in Nigeria each had two studies, without overlapping time periods, allowing for a percent change in mortality calculation [24, 28, 32, 36, 38, 39, 43, 44] . Findings showed a declining mortality trend overall within these cities, with the percent change ranging from a 15.6% The continued high mortality rates seen in many studies were attributed to several factors in the perioperative period. Late presentation by patients due to a delay in diagnosis, as well as difficulty accessing adequate medical care in rural areas, was common [43] . As all the hospitals included in this review were tertiary care centers, many of the patients had presented to outpatient clinics or traditional healers prior to admission. Many patients had sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities on admission requiring preoperative resuscitation. These factors led to a prolonged perforation-to-surgery interval, which has been shown to increase morbidity and mortality [29, 38, 41, 44] . In addition, the number of perforations present, lack of access to critical care management or an intensive care unit, and inadequate culture data to guide antibiotic therapy contribute to poor outcomes [7, 35] .",

However, once a child has typhoid, proper interventions to stop disease progression are lifesaving. Many authors reported on the need for a higher suspicion of typhoid when a child presents with a fever, as often they are first diagnosed with and [21-23, 26, 29, 31, 39, 43] . This assumption of malaria delays proper antibiotic treatment and allows progression of the disease, which can lead to TIP. Additionally, educating caretakers on the signs and symptoms of typhoid fever, its complications, and when to go to a health center or hospital are essential to ensure children are presenting early in the disease course, not weeks after onset [21, 22, 31, 40, 44] . If TIP does occur, prompt recognition will help decrease the perforation-tosurgery time internal, an important factor which could have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality [22, 23, 25, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 44] . Many publications in this review relied on clinical aspects to diagnose TIP. Perforations due to typhoid usually occur in the terminal ileum and are widely thought to occur due to necrosis of Peyer's patches, leading to ulceration and perforation. This produces a recognizable lesion of an oval perforation located longitudinally along the antimesenteric border (Fig. 3 ) [46] . When seen in conjunction with clinical signs for typhoid fever, this lesion is normally considered pathognomonic; however, other causes of non-traumatic bowel perforation can be hard to rule out, especially when culture data are unavailable. For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) enteritis and intestinal tuberculosis (TB), which can present similarly to typhoid fever, can be rare causes of perforation mostly seen in the colon, duodenum, and ileum [47] [48] [49] [50] . Intestinal TB more often presents with ulcerations, with the long axis located perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel [49, 50] , unlike in TIP. CMV enteritis is usually seen in immunocompromised patients, especially in conjunction with HIV, and has no associated seasonal variation [47, 48, 51] . In contrast, typhoid has been shown to have a seasonal incidence, and five of the papers showed correlations between TIP and the usual typhoid season in their region [27, [32] [33] [34] 40] .",

Only five studies reported using blood, stool, or peritoneal fluid cultures to aid in definitive diagnosis [22, 23, 31, 37, 38] , with just one study having a confirmed positive culture on all included patients [23] . The percentage of S. Typhi positive cultures among suspected cases ranged from about 25% to 50% for blood, stool, or peritoneal fluid. Many patients present later in the disease course, with some having already taken an antibiotic, lowering the sensitivity of cultures. As a result, the diagnosis is usually clinical and confirmed during surgery [33] .",

First, it is highly likely that studies were missed due to publication in local or regional journals. Second, even without language restrictions, our search only resulted in the inclusion of four non-English studies. It is possible research from this region is published in languages other than English or French and is not readily available to international readers. Third, the data presented are limited to 6 of the 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 75% from Nigeria. While there were additional papers from other countries with data from adults, studies specific to the pediatric population are lacking. As incidence and severity of TIP are increased in this age group, and as this is the population that will benefit most from the new TCV, having pediatric-specific data is imperative.",

Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were available from only one or two studies in five out of the six countries represented. In the case of Ghana, both studies were from the same urban health center, which makes it difficult to extrapolate these data countrywide. Additionally, all the studies were from tertiary healthcare centers, with the majority retrospective in nature. This can lead to referral and selection biases, which again can make it difficult to generalize to surrounding regions and likely underestimate the actual mortality related to TIP. It is highly probable that many children with TIP die before they ever reach a tertiary care center.",

The new WHO recommended single-dose TCV is now available for children over six months of age and was recently shown to be 81.6% efficacious in preventing typhoid fever in a randomized, controlled clinical trial in Nepal [52] . Thus far, only Pakistan, India, and Zimbabwe have begun to use this vaccine. In response to a typhoid outbreak in early 2019, Zimbabwe implemented a mass vaccine campaign which resulted in a decrease in typhoid cases seen among children [53] . In addition, Pakistan was the first country to introduce TCV into its routine immunization schedule beginning in November 2019 [54] . It is anticipated that the prevention of typhoid fever, with the help of TCV, will likewise lead to reductions in TIP and its associated morbidity and mortality [21, 22, 32, 34, [37] [38] [39] [40] 43] . Continued international support, especially from Gavi, will help to ensure that every child living in sub-Saharan Africa has access to this important vaccine.",
