Problems associated with the management of infections in these patients include dif fi culties in early diagnosis because the clinical signs of infection are subtle, the low performance of diagnostic tests, and suboptimal response to treatment because recovery of host defenses is a key factor for resolution of infection. Preventing these infections relies on infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. While infection control measures are safe (but not always effective), the use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis of infection is not devoid of problems. Its wide use may increase the possibility of the development of resistance, select for resistant organisms, and increase toxicity and cost. Therefore, any attempt to administer an antimicrobial agent should be accompanied by a re fl ection of the potential bene fi ts and risks of prophylaxis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction and General Principles: A Risk-Targeted Approach"}, {"text": "In general the higher is the incidence of infection the more bene fi cial is likely to be antimicrobial prophylaxis. Likewise, the shorter is the period at risk (and therefore the predicted duration of prophylaxis) the higher is the possibility that prophylaxis will work. However, the prediction of an incidence of infection is not simple, and requires an analysis of various factors including patient's prior exposure to pathogens, underlying disease, previous and current treatment, comorbidities, geographic area and others. Therefore, three questions are critical in de fi ning the appropriateness of antimicrobial prophylaxis: what is the risk for infection; what are the pathogens that predominate in this setting; and what is the period at risk. Table 51 .1 provides a risk-targeted approach to prophylaxis of infections in patients with hematological malignancies and Table 51 .2 presents the most frequent pathogens responsible for infection according to the type of immunode fi ciency present. In this chapter, we describe various strategies directed at the prevention of infections in patients with hematological malignancies, according to this risk-based strategy. Risk assessment in each underlying disease (e.g. age, initial white blood cell count, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, rapidity of cytoreduction in acute lymphoid leukemia; advanced age, de novo vs. secondary leukemia, prior myelodysplasia, cytogenetics, gene mutation pro fi le in acute myeloid leukemia; mutational status of immunoglobulin Vh gene and chromosomal abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia) b Most common disease-related immunosuppression include: hypogammaglobulinemia (multiple myeloma, low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia), T-cell mediated immunode fi ciency (Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and neutrophil dysfunction (acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia) Handwashing remains the simplest and most effective measure to prevent the acquisition of organisms by patients [ 1 ] . Patients and healthcare workers (HCW) should wash their hands before eating, smoking, or inserting or removing contact lenses, and after using the restroom, blowing their nose, coughing, sneezing, handling dirty items such as soiled gausses, or garbage and after touching an animal. In addition, healthcare workers should also wash their hands between patients. All surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned, including wrists, palms, back of hands, fi ngers and under the fi ngernails, preferably with an alcohol-based hand rub [ 2 ] . However, if hands are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or body fl uids, soap and water are best for cleaning hands [ 3 ] . Additional recommendations include the removal of rings prior to handwashing, keeping nails short and clean, and avoiding the use of arti fi cial nails as they may carry pathogens [ 4 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2043, "end": 2048, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2575, "end": 2580, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2705, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2893, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 754, "end": 762, "text": "Table 51", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 877, "end": 885, "text": "Table 51", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction and General Principles: A Risk-Targeted Approach"}, {"text": "The skin fl ora could potentially be a source of infections.
