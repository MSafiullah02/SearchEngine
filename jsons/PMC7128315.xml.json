The death toll from cholera there has continued to rise [3] and the recent impact of Hurricane Matthew in early October 2016 will undoubtedly exacerbate the problem [4]. The cholera outbreak is now believed to have resulted in approximately 10,000 dead and over 800,000 infected [5], [6].",

Classic shoe-leather epidemiology, which was later confirmed by genomic analysis, has now unequivocally determined the cause of the outbreak to be UN peacekeeping troops from Nepal [11], [13]:the MINUSTAH camp contaminated the Meille tributary with fecal matter by their unsanitary practice of sewage drainage, and the Meille tributary connects downstream to the Latem River that goes through the town of Mirebalais, the site of the first reported cholera case[11], [14]\n",

In such a context and facing global disease transmission networks [19] it is imperative that the UN retains the confidence of not only the representatives of member state Governments, but of the populace as well. Denials in the face of insurmountable evidence, followed eventually by partial admissions, and leaked reports have seriously damaged the integrity of the UN in the health sphere [5], [12]. One can hope that the UN will decide on full disclosure, a formal apology, and restoration before Guterres assumes his role as the next Secretary- General of the UN. If not, it should be one of his first actions. Either way, if the UN is to restore confidence in the health arena it must work on inspiring trust in its activities. Given the strength of nationalism, which can serve to essentially undermine the UN, it needs to be above reproach and perhaps more importantly to be seen as being above reproach. As Secretary-General Guterres needs to introduce a culture change, moving the UN organization towards transparency and accountability if it is to restore faith, respect and support.",
