A recent meta-analysis evaluated the clinical impact of molecular RDTs for respiratory viruses by analyzing 56 individual test accuracy studies and showed that, in comparison to conventional molecular assays, RDTs did not reduce antibiotic use and duration, isolation measures or admission rates, but increased use of oseltamivir in influenza positive cases and reduced LOS [57].",

Analytical performance characteristics, compared to reference PCR assays, are good to excellent (sensitivity and specificity from 80 to 100% for all targets). Of note, some bacterial targets have been validated with fewer than 10 positive samples, and performance characteristics of bacterial PCR have sometimes been reported to be lower than those of viral PCR [19], highlighting the need for caution when interpreting cumulative performance results.

Light microscopy is widely used but requires highly-trained staff. ICTs are cheap and have a sensitivity of minimum 95% compared to microscopy and a specificity of >90% for all Plasmodium species [67]. Note that the BinaxNOW malaria test (Alere), able to detect the four Plasmodium species, is the only ICT approved by the FDA. Currently, no PCR-based RDT is commercially available.

In the ED context, POC testing significantly decreases overtreatment of gonorrhea and trichomoniasis compared to NAAT testing [70]. Implementation of rapid testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea directly from triage using self-collected specimens can dramatically reduce overtreatment [34, 54].

            "text": "Appropriate integration of RDTs into the clinical environment is often an overlooked component. Pragmatically, successful implementation depends on three key questions: Who will perform the test? What is the optimal time point of specimen collection? Where should the sample be processed? Questions on appropriate timing and who should be in charge are directly related to the ultimate goal of testing. If the primary objectives are prompt isolation (e.g., POC tests for detection of influenza in patients with ILI), quick administration of anti-infective drugs in critical patients (e.g., malaria in febrile returning traveler) or improved patient throughput, testing might be performed by triage nurses, based on precise and simple clinical case definitions. Conversely, other tests require more complex interpretation or sampling such as LRTI panels and should thus be limited to confirmed pneumonia patients. Training for assay implementation is strongly required, and additional human resources may be needed for timely integration into ED workflow. Clinicians also need to receive regular training on indications and interpretation of RDT results in collaboration with clinical microbiologists [80]. Finally, with the rapid expansion of RDTs in the ED for both infectious and noninfectious syndromes, space and time constraints for instruments should also be anticipated.",

Most of these assays display adequate analytical performance yet additional high-quality studies are needed to better assess their impact. These assays must be appropriately integrated into ED workflow, taking into account local constraints and priorities. Furthermore, RDTs cannot yet replace conventional methods since they are not exhaustive, have performance limitations, and provide limited data on antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Finally and most importantly, their clinical and economic impact remains uncertain: there is a need to conduct rigorous studies such as randomized controlled clinical trials, to determine their actual impact on clinical management and outcomes such as time to optimal therapy, length of ED or hospital stay, cost effectiveness, mortality, as well as their role in antimicrobial stewardship interventions.",
