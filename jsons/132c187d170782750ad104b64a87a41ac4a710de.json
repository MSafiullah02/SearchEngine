A technology to detect Covid-19 quickly and accurately is required with utmost urgency. Currently, this novel disease is confirmed by reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. However, it has been reported that RT-PCR sensitivity may not be high enough for this purpose early detection and may need complementary tests.",

Owing to that reason, Covid-19 radiological literatures during the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, were primarily focused on CT findings [1] . Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has shown great success in the medical imaging domain because of its high feature extraction ability. It is deemed useful for many tasks, namely classification, denoising, prediction, and auto detection. In the beginning of 2020, several researchers from Wuhan, China proposed methods to distinguish Covid-19 with a new deep learning model namely, COVNet (Covid-19 Detection Neural Network) using chest CT images. The model divides into three class, namely Covid-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and other non-Pneumonia cases. The sensitivity and specificity reached 90% and 96% respectively [2] .",

In CLAHE method, the contrast amplification in the vicinity of a given pixel value is given by the slope of the transformation function. At the end of preprocessing, by still considering the aspect ratio of the images, all images were resized to the same size.

It is followed by open source data from two links, namely: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge. The class were divided into two, namely 'Covid19' and 'others', with 'others' being a set of CXR that has been diagnosed as normal and another lung pathology. The ratio of training and testing in terms of number of images was 75:25. Moreover, image augmentation was done to multiply the data, while the augmentation technique used are random horizontal flip, random CLAHE, and random color jitter. Limiting technique of augmentation is a must to consider the state of the image in the real field. Figure 3 displays the results of the evaluation step by taking six random chest x-ray images into each class. It calculated the level of accuracy based on the confusion matrix, i.e. a table used to describe the performance of a classification model (or \"classifier\") on a test data set whose true value is known. This allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. In the primary stage, the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is, 100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Furthermore, the specificity is 96.97% and the sensitivity is 100%. This results are currently higher than previous studies to classify Covid-19 based on chest x-ray images [3] [11] . when the model is used to recognize 'Others' and 'Covid-19', difficulty is present with only two model classes while one being of many types of pathology with similar physical characteristics in the lungs with Covid-19. To handle bias classification and false negative, SoftMax was used. However, different x-ray machines might have different x-ray beam quality and imaging characteristics due to different type of image receptors. Therefore, additional data training might be beneficial prior to applying this model on new set of devices. To facilitate further use, this model is run in web form with the link http://sci.ui.ac.id/detectcovid with the interface being shown in Figure 3 , the web can diagnosis Covid-19 by this novel deep learning model and only require less than 1 minute processing time.
