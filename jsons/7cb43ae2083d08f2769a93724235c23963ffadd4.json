This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. Methods The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. Results The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. Conclusion Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.",

Patients with DME and branch retinal vein occlusion are less likely to suffer irreversible vision loss in the short term [18, 19] , and postponement of appointments for nonmonocular patients may be considered (except for patients with significant vision loss from recent DME and patients in the acute phase of retinal vein occlusion). However, prolonged treatment postponement (> 4-6 months) should be avoided and the situation should be reassessed within 2-3 months depending on the stage of the pandemic and the confinement measures in place in each individual country. These considerations should be thoroughly discussed (remotely) with the patients and staff, taking into account the local legal/ regulatory environment, status of the epidemic, and the capacity of each practice to reschedule postponed procedures.

Such patients may need OCT and visual acuity assessments and management changed, if deemed appropriate Wet AMD: Diagnosis confirmed with OCT and OCT-A, if available. Confirmed new wet AMD cases should be treated with a loading phase of 3 injections of anti-VEGF and then continued on 8 weekly with no clinic review. Consent is taken on the day of first injection DME: Defer anti-VEGF injections and review in clinic after 4 months. Exceptions are eyes with severe NPDR and active PDR that may require anti-VEGF agents and PRP. Virtual review with OCT and wide-field color photography is the preferred option to review these patients DME: Defer treatment for 6 months unless associated with R3. R3 patients should be treated with PRP BRVO: Defer review in clinic by 4 months BRVO: Defer review in clinic by 4 months CRVO: For patients with macular edema due to CRVO who have had at least 6 injections, consider PRP if required. Otherwise, review in clinic in 4 months CRVO: Provide 6 mandated loading phases if visual impairment due to macular edema and then review in clinic. If, in the opinion of the clinician, there is no hope of visual improvement, an alternative approach is an extensive PRP laser to reduce the risk of rubeotic glaucoma. However, visual outcomes are likely to be poorer with this approach Cited with permission from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth).
