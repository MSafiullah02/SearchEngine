Mean pulmonary arterial\nhypertension and increased pulmonary vascular muscle degrees were also observed in\nrats exposed to cigarette smoke for 16 weeks.14 Our findings were consistent\nwith the above study; cigarette exposure for six months can significantly increase\nRVSP in rats. In summary, chronic cigarette smoke may directly lead to the pulmonary\nartery remodeling and PAH. In recent years, it has been found that exposure to\nnicotine (the main component of cigarette smoke) can increase both the expression\nand activity of ACE in human endothelial cells.15 ACE plays a key role in the\nRAAS system, which can convert Ang I to AngII; cigarette smoke exposure can activate\nthe RAAS system to increase AngII levels. The major physiological and\npharmacological effects of AngII are mediated by AT1R,16 and it has been confirmed that\nAngII plays an important role in PAH by binding to AT1R.16 This study suggested that the\npathogenesis of cigarette-induced PAH also involves the activation of the RAAS\nsystem. We found that compared with the control group, PAH rats exposed to cigarette\nsmoke for six months had a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increased expression\nof ACE and AngII (almost double). In the RAAS system, ACE decomposes Ang I to\ngenerate potent vasoconstrictor and ACE2 hydrolyzes Ang I to generate a negative\nregulatory protein Ang (1\u20137).9 In previous study, Karram et al.17 found that losartan therapy\naffected plasma ACE protein expression in normotensive rats. Some experiments have\nconfirmed that losartan can effectively increase ACE2 activity and its protein\nexpression in rat myocardium or human kidney. Increased ACE2 can accelerate the\nconversion of AngII to Ang (1\u20137) to reduce the concentration of AngII.18\u201319 This study\nfound that after six months of exposure to cigarette, ACE2 protein expression was\nsignificantly reduced and pulmonary artery pressure was increased significantly in\nrat lungs.",
