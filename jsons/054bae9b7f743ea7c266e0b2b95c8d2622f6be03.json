Third, only transient positive results in amniocentesis have been reported for pregnant women infected with Zika virus, another RNA virus. 5 Finally, the virus might have been undetectable in amniotic fluid because of insufficient gestational age-the best time for amniocentesis is after 18-21 weeks' gestation. 6 The study was limited by a small sample size and a lack of cord blood. However, we hope these findings will contribute to understanding of the potential for intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. Larger, prospective studies and more data are needed. ",

The ethics committee of Tongji Hospital approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from both patients. Clinical records and laboratory results were retrospectively reviewed for two pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) in the first trimester of pregnancy. The first patient (case 1; figure; appendix) was a 34-year-old primiparous woman who was admitted to hospital on Jan 30 after developing a cough on Jan 26 (8 weeks plus 5 days of gestation); her husband had previously had a fever and been diagnosed with COVID-19. On Feb 3, chest CT showed typical signs of viral infection of both lungs, and so a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. On Feb 13, the patient was observed as being in the recovery phase on CT, discharged from hospital, and isolated at home.",
