The connection between RBD and ACE2 also participates in the fusion of the virus and host cells and then stimulates the organism to produce neutralizing antibodies and to mediate cellular immune response [15], [16]. Xiao et al. found that the above process does not require the participation of other proteins, and ACE2 becomes a key target for SARS-CoV fusion with host cells [17]. Scholars have found that the RBD sequences of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are highly similar [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. This result suggests that the invasion mechanism of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be highly similar.",

Therefore, 2019-nCoV should be detectable in saliva. Related studies have shown that nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV could be detected in saliva samples from 91.7% (11/12) of patients by polymerase chain reaction; the live virus is confirmed by viral culture, which is isolated from saliva [19].

These aspects are similar to the clinical character of CONVID-19 [9]. The second phase is tissue damage associated with excessive immunoreaction. A large number of mononuclear macrophages were observed in pathological lesions of SARS-CoV target organs, and some of them activated; they play the role of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in immunoreaction [23]. In the second phase, in the immunopathological progression, secreted inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-6, IL-16, and TNF-\u03b1, promote the inflammatory response to induce relatively severe tissue damage [23].",

Ductal stenosis that may be caused by hyperplasia of fibrous connective tissue around ducts can also reduce the salivary flow, increasing the incidence of the above diseases [29].

Research on the clinical characteristics of patients has been published in various professional journals, but the focus is mainly on the related damage of the respiratory, digestive, and urinary systems [9], [10]. Of course, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the isolation of patients, medical professionals in other related professions are still unable to participate in the comprehensive evaluation of patients, so some clinical characteristics of COVID-19 may be missed.
