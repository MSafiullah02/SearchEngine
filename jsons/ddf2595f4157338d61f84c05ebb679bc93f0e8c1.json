According to the principle of air cleaning technology, the performance with larger air change rate is better. This has been proved and no further experimental verification is needed. For example, it is of no use to prove that the performance with the air change rate 12 h \u22121 is better than that with 10 h \u22121 , or the performance with 10 h \u22121 is better than that with 8 h \u22121 . But the relationship is not completely linear proportional. It does not mean that better performance will be obtained when the air change rate increases too much. There is an economic problem.",

Just as that mentioned in Chap. 1, it is almost blank in the research and construction of isolation ward these years. Therefore, the related material is very rare. It is difficult to verify and summarize through practice, not to mention that the comprehensive practice is difficult to be found. So usually the specification or suggestion from related literatures from U.S.A. are used as reference. For example, in ASHRAE manual in U.S.A., based on the requirement of thermal comfort, the air change rate in the isolation ward for the pulmonary tuberculosis patient is 6 h \u22121 . This is much less than that specified in other literatures, which is shown in Table 5 .1.",

The corresponding maximum penetration particulate size is equivalent with 0.075 lm. This means that the particle size 0.075 lm corresponds to the minimum efficiency under the filtration velocity 14.17 cm/s. Therefore, test aerosol with diameter 0.075 lm and the filtration velocity 14.17 cm/s are the most unfavorable conditions. When the efficiency under the most unfavorable conditions is met, the requirement under other conditions can be easily satisfied. As mentioned before, there were no one infected when they wore N95 masks. From the aspect of most stringent requirement, there was no bioaerosol inhaled. If even one particle with diameter 0.075 lm was inhaled, there is no possibility for other droplet nuclei to be inhaled (since the efficiency with other particles is higher than that with 0.075 lm). When the medical personnel enter into the ward, it usually takes less than 0.5 h. When special treatment is needed, it may take more than 1 h. In this case, it can be assumed 1.5 h. According to Chinese standard on medical masks, the requirement for the efficiency 95% is under the flow rate 85L/min. We know that the common respiratory flow rate is between 8L/min and 80L/min. It is a much safer consideration for the standard to set such flow rate. When the flow rate of respiratory air is 85L/min, in the inhaled air within 1.5 h, the concentration of particles with diameter 0.075 lm will not be larger than 1/(90 \u00c2 85) = 1.3 \u00c2 10 \u22124 pc/L. Therefore, when the efficiency of mask reaches 95%, the concentration of particles with diameter 0.075 lm should not exceed 2.6 \u00c2 10 \u22124 pc/L.
