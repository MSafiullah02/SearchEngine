It began as unidentified pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019. No vaccine has been produced till now. Mathematical models are used to study impact of different measures used to decrease pandemic. Mathematical models have been designed to estimate the numbers of spreaders in different scenarios in the present manuscript. In the present manuscript, three different mathematical models have been proposed with different scenarios such as screening, quarantine and NPIs for estimating number of virus spreaders. the analysis shows that the numbers of COVID-19 patients will be more without screening the peoples coming from other countries. Since, every people suffering with COVID-19 disease are spreaders. The screening and quarantine with NPIs have been implemented to study their impact on the spreaders. It has been found that NPI measures are able to reduce number of spreaders. The NPI measures reduces the growth of the spread function and providing decision makers more time to prepare with in dealing of the disease.",

            "text": "First Corona case has been reported in Wuhan city of Hubei Province in south Chinea on december 31, 2019 as unidentified pneumonia [1, 2] . On 7 January 2020, Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified virus as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which belongs to the same virus family of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South China in 2002-2003 [3] . Coronavirus is first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe [4] . it has four family members namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta. While alpha and beta coronaviruses apparently originate from bats, gamma and delta viruses originate from pigs and birds. Among these beta coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha-coronavirus cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-COVID-2) belongs to beta-coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS-COVID-2 virus. SARS-COVID-2 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough [5] . Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing [6] . People can be infected of COVID-19 disease from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that human-to-human transmission may be occurring during the asymptomatic incubation period of COVID-19, which has been estimated to be between 2 to 10 days [7] . On 30th January 2020, the WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 as pandemic [5] . All major counties have suspended all the international flights to reduce international traveller to the country for preventing COVID-19 diseases [6] . At present, no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for COVID-19. The countries have taken strong measures to prohibit the virus's transmission, such as warning citizens from going outdoors, temporarily suspending the public transport between some big cities, and even taking quarantine for the main infected city. These unprecedented measures were expected to effectively stop the virus transmission and buy necessary time to deploy medical resources to the affected area [7] . The rapid spread of the COVID-19 may be due to multiple causes. One cause is the lacking of information transparency at the early stage of the epidemic outbreak. Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The authentic and transparent information could have prohibited the spread of the COVID-19 at the early stage. The other cause is the lacking of scientific diagnostic criterion for the COVID-19. Rapid developing exact testing techniques for a novel virus is very difficult. In fact, the symptoms of the COVID-19 are highly similar to those of flu. This aggravated the hardship of diagnosis. The last but not the least, the lacking of an epidemic warning and prediction system lost the opportunity to prohibit the epidemic spread at the initial stage. Mathematical modelling has gained more attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences [8, 9, 10, 11] . It has been used for cancer detection, segmentation and classification [12, 13, 14, 15] .These models are useful in the cases where disease dynamics are not unclear. It estimates the number of cases in worst and best-case scenarios. It is also helpful in estimating effect of preventive measures adopted against novel viruses such as COVID-19. One family of these models is the dynamical epidemic model called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The SIR model originated from the study of the plague almost one hundred years ago. Tremendous advance has been achieved in dynamical epidemic model since mid-20th century. In recent decades, some realistic factors influencing the epidemic transmission were included in the classic SIR model, such as the model considering the incubation stage, the SEIRS model considering the population age and the population exposed to epidemic, and the SIS model including birth and death of the susceptible. Some dynamical models were also designed for specific epidemic. In the present manuscript, a novel mathematical model is being presented for estimating novel corona virus patients. The proposed model also considers Non-Pharmacological interventions (NPIs) such as Social distancing, closure of schools, universities and offices, avoidance of mass gatherings, community-wide containment etc [16, 17] . Also, the proposed model has been analysed with the general population, contacts of cases (Contact tracing, Surveillance, quarantine) and the cases themselves (Early Reporting, Isolation). The present work is organized as follows. The mathematical model for COVID-19 spread estimation is presented in section 2. Section 3 discusses data set used for validating proposed mathematical models. Results ad discussions are presented in section 4.",

The proposed mathematical model is presented in the Figure 1 . In the Figure 1 , at the top level COVID-19 screening is being done. At this time, peoples are being tested for COVID-19 diseases. Hence, the peoples are divided into two groups namely the peoples with COVID-19 disease and the peoples without COVID-19 disease. The peoples with COVID-19 are quarantined so that they cannot infect other peoples. It is also possible that the COVID-19 symptoms may appear further after initial screening. Hence, these peoples are further divided into two groups namely infectious and non-infectious. The infectious peoples are categorized into three categories based on symptoms such as the peoples having symptoms, the peoples having mild symptoms and the peoples not having any kind of symptoms. The peoples having symptoms are suggested to be self-quarantined. The self-quarantined peoples may be cured or died. The peoples who are not self-quarantined may die or having sufficient immunity to face COVID-19 and virus died after completing period. The peoples having mild symptoms are suggested to be self-quarantined. If they follow quarantine; they may have symptoms which follow the process described previously. The people may die or virus may die after completing virus cycle. The COVID-19 symptoms may be developed further.",

The NPI includes distancing measures like no handshaking, working from home, closing of educational institutions, cancellation of mass gatherings, partial or total closure of malls/ markets closure of public transportation and voluntary civic shutdown, \"Janata curfew\" etc. In this model, not all the peoples who suffering with COVID-19 diseases are spreaders. The proposed mathematical model is same as presented in the Figure 1 . However, in this model, NPI measures are being implemented to reduce number of spreaders. The estimated number of peoples with COVID-19 diseases will be less than that the model presented in the section 2.1 and 2.2. This model focuses on reducing the leakage term presented in model 2. NPI measures reduces the number of persons which can come in contact with the spreaders and hence reduces the leakage. Table 1 tabulates COVID-19 data for India [18] . It has various fields such as date, time, active cases, total cured cases, total death cases, total cases, new case, daily death cases and daily cured cases. Here, date and time field describe the COVID-19 cases at particular date and time. Active cases and cured cases are the number of peoples with COVID-19 disease and cured COVID-19 disease cases respectively. Total death field describe number of peoples died due to COVID-19 disease. Total cases field is sum of active cases, death cases and cured cases. Total death field describe number of deaths due to COVID-19 disease.

India has started the screening as early as in early of January 2020. All the travellers coming from selected countries have been screened at international airport. These travellers have been further divided in quarantine group and normal group depending on the condition at time of inspection. This condition represented by proposed model 2. At this stage, NPI interventions were not there or present in very minimal amount. It can be noticed from model 2 that the total number of cases is summation of quarantine cases and leakage. It can also be noticed that leakage that exponential behaviour. The multiplication term present in leakage reduces the growth of the function. It can also be noticed from the figure ?? and ??. Figure ? ? and ?? are representing the spread scenario before NPI interventions. Only screening and quarantine were in place. The growth shows a random behaviour due to small contribution from leakage factor. The quarantine cases follow a linear nature and have large impact on total cases and active cases initially. Impact of leakage factor increases with time and the graph is also showing similar behaviour. Table 1 presents the data for India. It has been plotted to have visual results. Figure ? ? shows the total number of infected persons who have been cured from this disease. It can be noticed that plot is showing a growth with time and more people are coming out from this pandemic. Figure ? ? represents total death occurred. It can also be noticed that with the time number of death are also increasing. It has been found that the growth of death curve is lesser than the growth of total cured. Figure ? ? and ?? present the active cases and total cases of COVID-19 in India respectively. Curve fitting has been used to obtain the best fitted equation for the data. It has been reported that exponential curve fitting is providing good results with approximately 96% accuracy. Although, active cases and total cases is following exponential behaviour, yet the growth is in the order of 0.17 approximately for active cases as well as for total cases also. This shows 10 .

The effectiveness of quarantine depends on the compliance by individuals and public health measures that are instituted. The results obtained by this model are shown in the table ??. It shows the number of active cases and total cases after imposing NPI measures. Figure ? ? and ?? represent the active cases and total cases after NPI measures such as Lockdown, social distancing etc. It can be analysed for the figure ?? and ? ? that lockdown reduces spread exotically. Table ? ? and ?? presents the R2 values for different curve fitting methods applied on figure ? ? and ?? for active cases and total cases respectively. T has been found that polynomial fitting of order 2 is providing good fitting results for both active and total cases scenario. This indicates that the growth of active and total cases reduces from exponential to polynomial. Hence, NPI measures has reduces or slowdown the growth of COVID-19 which has been also indicated in figure 6 . Complete lockdown represents full implementation of NPI measures to entire population. Our model shows that immediate implementation of effective combination of screening, quarantine and NPIs reduces COVID-19 disease drastically. Hence, the numbers infected peoples with COVID-19 become manageable, reducing from millions to merely thousands. The overall COVID-19 spread in India has been shown in Figure ? ? along with approximation obtained by proposed method. The lockdown period required by the India has been analysed as per growth rate obtained. It has been shown in the Figure ? ?.

It has been found that the numbers of COVID-19 patients will be more without screening the peoples coming from other countries. Since, every people suffering with COVID-19 disease are spreaders. The screening and quarantine have been implemented in mathematical model 2. It has been found that number of spreaders is less than that of model 1. However, expected performance is not achieved due to leakage i.e. peoples not following quarantine. Mathematical model 3 has been designed with screening, quarantine with NPIs. It has achieved reasonable performance in reducing number of spreaders. Hence, it is found that immediate implementation of Non-Pharmacological Interventions among the general population, including complete lockdowns, has the potential to retard the progress of the pandemic.
