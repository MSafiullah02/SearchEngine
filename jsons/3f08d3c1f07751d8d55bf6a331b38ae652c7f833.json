This facility is unique in that it is the only maximum containment laboratory in the world where conventional and molecular medical imaging equipments are incorporated into the design of the facility. This capability provides investigators with unique tools to dissect disease pathogenesis, evaluate the ability of animal models to recapitulate human disease, and test candidate countermeasures. Importantly, advanced molecular imaging has the potential to provide alternative endpoints to lethality. Using these alternative endpoints, investigators can reduce the number of animals used in experiments and evaluate countermeasures in sublethal models. With the incorporation of medical imaging modalities, a clinical laboratory modeled after those existing in hospitals, and a highly trained veterinary medicine team, IRF-Frederick is uniquely suited to advance our understanding of emerging infectious diseases and to facilitate the development of medical countermeasures and clinical care paradigms previously considered impossible.",

However, many recently developed clinical tools had not yet been applied to the study of high-consequence pathogens. Thus, results from many previous animal challenge studies conveyed only an imprecise understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of emerging pathogens. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development, animal models must closely recapitulate the human disease. Thus, the IRF was designed to incorporate not only standard features seen in most BSL-4 laboratories but also state-of-the-art clinical equipment including medical imaging capabilities. The expectation is that increased understanding of the disease processes associated with high-consequence pathogens will facilitate the development of MCM and management options.",

Research within this category goes directly to the IRF for prioritization, resource allocation, and operational planning. All other research projects require the Scientific Steering Committee review. This committee ensures fair and equitable reviews by NIH intramural division directors and external advisors. The committee makes its recommendations to the IRF Director based on qualifying research parameters: 1) Relevance to NIAID, DCR, and IRF missions 2) Requirement for unique capabilities of IRF 3) Ability to advance IRF capabilities for supporting cutting-edge infectious disease research 4) Relevance to human disease 5) Use of complex biologic systems to answer questions regarding disease pathogenesis and strategies for intervention including antimicrobials, vaccines, and other countermeasures 6) Use of surrogate systems to test clinical hypotheses Priority will be given to proposed projects that require medical imaging and involve category A viral agents requiring BSL-4 containment (e.g. filoviruses, arenaviruses, henipaviruses). However, other projects will be considered based on the availability of resources. Work with these pathogens will commence immediately after CDC Select Agent approval which is anticipated in early 2014.

The use of techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will provide unique insights into disease pathogenesis including inflammation, altered systemic vascular function, coagulation, and tissue damage. With these technologies, investigators can chart the evolution of lesions in individual animals and link these findings with clinical manifestations, changes in laboratory values, and other indicators of disease severity. Investigators and veterinarians analyze generated data in real time and alter treatment protocols or clinical algorithms.

Under this rule, regulators expect that the pathophysiologic emerging disease process in the animal model is reasonably well understood and recapitulates the human condition. Demonstration that the MCM mitigates this disease is also required. Usually, the Food and Drug Administration requires this demonstration in more than one animal species unless a model in a single species is demonstrated to be 'sufficiently well characterized' to predict therapeutic responses. In that case, a second species may not be needed.

This endpoint has presented significant challenges when the best available models are not uniformly lethal or when the disease severity does not match human disease from emerging pathogens. As a result, investigators are often faced with the daunting choices of using large numbers of animals, adapting the pathogen of interest to be more lethal in animal model(s), or developing models using genetically modified animals. By definition, adaptation changes the nature of the pathogen which raised concerns regarding relevance to the human pathogen as well as dual-use regulatory concerns. While genetically altered animals may offer alternatives, the expression or deletion of the gene of interest usually fails to fully recapitulate the disease following infection. Generally, investigators are concerned that expression or deletion of a gene typically results in altered phenotypes that may impact the interpretation of results from these models. The availability of MI opens the potential to identify and use alternative outcomes in lieu of these other options.",

With MI, scientists are able to chart the development and quantification of lung lesions (Fig. 1) . This ability will be critical for assessing potential countermeasures in this very mild disease model. In addition, use of medical imaging also has the potential to reduce the number of animals needed during a study, complying with Russell and Burch's three Rs (refinement, reduction, and replacement of the use of animals in research) of animal research.

MR images can be obtained with or without contrast agents. By exploiting endogenous sources of contrast, exogenous and potentially harmful contrast agents are not required. The wide variety of MRI techniques available provides flexibility in monitoring infectious disease processes in the BSL-4 environment. For instance, a number of MRI techniques have been developed to assess vascular permeability, integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and edema formation. In addition to quantifying vascular permeability, MRI could potentially be used to track cell migration (Hoehn et al., 2007) during viral infections. MRI will therefore be a useful tool to follow the development of endothelial leakage during the progression of a viral hemorrhagic fever or to observe real-time immune responses as visualized by macrophage migration postinoculation. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures changes in relative amounts of certain metabolites in an infected tissue of interest during the course of infection or therapeutic intervention.",

The subject is then imaged and the concentrations of the probe in tissues are measured. Images of probe uptake with PET are overlaid or co-registered with the three-dimensional images of the internal structures of the subject (CT). For example, if investigators are interested in identifying tissues or regions with increased metabolism as an indicator for inflammation or increased cellular replication, fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG), an analog of glucose, is administered to the subject. As cells take up this glucose analog, the probe accumulates, and the scintillation crystals on the detectors measure the released photons. When combined with CT and image analysis, investigators visualize and quantitate areas of inflammation in discrete anatomic locations. PET is presently being used at the IRF to establish the tissue distribution of T705 (an antiviral drug), the relationship Fig. 1 CT 3D volume-rendered images of lungs of nonhuman primates acquired prior to intratracheal inoculation (baseline) with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus and on days 1, 3, 9, and 13 postinoculation.

Recent progress in iterative reconstruction techniques is improving the resolution of images generated by SPECT. However, PET remains the modality of choice when higher resolution is needed. With the availability of both modalities increases the choice of probes that can be radiolabeled and extends the range of studies that are possible in imaging diseases of emerging pathogens.",

            "text": "Incorporation and use of MI equipment in maximum containment present a unique set of challenges for architects, engineers, safety officials, scientists. If the imaging equipment is located inside high containment, subjecting the imaging device to decontamination procedures may increase the risk of damage (e.g. caustic etching of detectors, progressive degradation of device wiring insulation, corrosion of solder points). In general, BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory areas are decontaminated by exposure to paraformaldehyde gas followed by ammonium bicarbonate neutralization. Frequent maintenance of MI equipment is often necessary, and requiring service engineers to enter BSL-4 areas is an untenable option. Two options were considered to permit safe insertion of the infected animals into the bore of the instrument without breaking the biocontainment barrier. One option is to place the animal in a closed containment tube that is then transported and positioned within the bore of the instrument. However, the logistics of maintaining ventilation and anesthesia of these animals while maintaining BSL-4 conditions inside the tube seem insurmountable. The alternative approach is to reconfigure the equipment, leaving only the bare minimum of components within the BSL-4 laboratory and developing an extension of the BSL-4 laboratory that protrudes into the bore of each machine. These unique challenges were innovatively addressed (de Kok-Mercado et al., 2011) by placing the bulk of the imaging equipment outside the BSL-4 suite (Fig. 2) . The high-containment zone is extended into the bore of each imaging device with the use of transparent biocontainment tubes made of polycarbonate resin thermoplastic (Philips Bioshield TM , North Ryde, Australia). This design facilitates routine maintenance of the delicate instruments by factory-trained personnel without entering the BSL-4 environment. With the animal inside the biocontainment tube, the veterinary care team has access to the animal during the procedures to ensure the health and well-being of the animal. Photographs of the 'hot' and 'cold' sides of the SPECT imaging rooms are presented in Fig. 3 .",

To maintain these functions, advanced life support, including multiparameter patient monitors (e.g. electrocardiography), and forced air warming blankets were put into place. In addition, inhalation anesthesia equipment and mechanical ventilators for respiration-compromised animals or for breathe holds required for imaging were used throughout the facility.

In addition to the three Rs, the committee stressed the importance of using methods to develop animal models that will transfer to a culture of good laboratory practices for the development of MCM. In the past, many investigations relied on the similarities in the phenotypic presentation of disease in animals compared to humans, rather than similarities in the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. By relying on phenotypic similarities and assumed absolute conservation of molecular processes in closely related animals of different species, investigators have raised doubts about the ability of existing animal models to accurately recapitulate human disease or predict efficacy of candidate therapeutics in humans (Seok et al., 2013) . In addition, the scientific, funding, and regulatory communities realize that one animal model may not recapitulate all aspects of disease. Expectation of uniform or near uniform lethality from pathogen challenge is neither reasonable or in all cases appropriate. As a result, with the use of alternative endpoints besides lethality, investigators can evaluate MCM in nonlethal models rather than forcing a disease course more severe than the human condition.",
