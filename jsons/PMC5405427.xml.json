On the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis, CoVs can be divided into four distinct genera, termed alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010 and delta\u2010CoVs.10 In the past, human CoV infections have all resulted from alpha\u2010 and beta\u2010CoVs (i.e., SARS and MERS are beta\u2010CoVs), with no cases involving gamma\u2010 or delta\u2010CoVs repreted so far. However, the risk of cross\u2010species infection from gamma and delta genera should not be ignored, and research concerning these two genera is critical to enable quick and efficient responses to novel animal\u2010to\u2010human CoV infections in the future.",

            "text": "Avian IBV is a gamma\u2010CoV that causes a highly contagious disease in domestic fowl. As such, avian IBV is one of the primary sources of economic loss in the poultry industry.11 New viral serotypes continue to emerge due to viral mutation and recombination, making this virus very difficult to control.12 The genome of IBV consists of single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA that is 27.6 kb in length.13 Upon infection, viral replicase proteins are translated from the genomic RNA, initially generating two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins are then processed into 15 individual nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u201316) by two virus\u2010encoded proteinases, 3C\u2010like and papain\u2010like proteinases.14, 15 These nsps assemble into a replicase complex responsible for viral transcription and replication.16 To understand the molecular mechanisms of IBV replication, great effort has been made to characterize nsp structures. To date, only a few nsp structures from IBV have been determined, including nsp2a, the ADRP (adenosine diphosphate\u2010ribose\u20101\u2033\u2010phosphatase) domain of nsp3, and nsp5 main protease (PDB:3LD1,3EWO,3EJF,3EKE,4X2Z).17, 18, 19\n",

The dimeric structure of nsp9 for SARS\u2010CoV was first reported by Egloff et al.21 They observed that the nsp9 dimer is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between two parallel \u03b1\u2010helices (we call this Form\u2010A). The SARS\u2010CoV nsp9 contains a protein\u2010protein association motif \u201cGXXXG\u201d (residues G100\u2013G104) on the parallel \u03b1\u2010helices of the nsp9 dimer.23, 24 Mutation of a single residue (G104E) within this motif terminates viral assembly in vivo. This mutation may alter the \u03b1\u2010helical interaction and disrupt nsp9 dimerization.25 This indicates that the dimeric form of nsp9 is essential for viral infection and also suggests that the disruption of nsp9 dimerization may be an effective strategy for combating CoV\u2010associated diseases. Although Form A seems to be the proper dimeric form of nsp9, other researchers have observed two different nsp9 dimers. Sutton et al. also solved the SARS\u2010CoV nsp9 structure, confirming that it forms a dimer in two different space groups.22 However, they also described a different dimer for SARS\u2010CoV nsp9, which is formed by an interaction between \u03b2\u2010strands (\u03b25)\u2014one from each subunit (we call this Form\u2010B). Later, Ponnusamy et al. determined the nsp9 structure for HCoV\u2010229E, revealing a third homodimeric form (Form\u2010C), which is formed via interactions between two anti\u2010parallel \u03b1\u2010helices, with a disulfide\u2010linkage between the two Cys69s within the interacting helices.26 This structure formed a trimer of dimers in the crystal, which is also different from the two structures previously determined for SARS\u2010CoV nsp9. These observations raise an important question; whether there is a common and conserved dimeric form for all CoV nsp9s, or whether there are different dimeric forms for diferent CoV nsp9s. Moreover, no structural information is available for nsp9s of other CoV genera (particularly gamma\u2010CoVs). It is important to determine which type of dimer these nsp9s form, and whether there is structural and functional conservation among these nsp9s from different CoV genera.",

We resolved the crystal structure of IBV nsp9 at 2.5 \u00c5, which revealed a Form\u2010A dimeric conformation (similar to SARS\u2010CoV nsp9). The homodimeric interface was formed by two parallel \u03b1\u2010helices, which was further surrounded by a hydrophobic shell. The residues involved in this hydrophobic interaction are conserved across species, suggesting that nsp9 homodimerization in Form A is essential for all CoVs. We further characterized six conserved residues within the dimeric interface of IBV nsp9 by site\u2010directed mutagenesis and biochemical approaches, and found that residues F73, I95, and G98 were critical for both dimerization and RNA interactions.",

This large range in conservation is notable, as nsp9 is crucial for viral replication and therefore a higher level of conservation was expected. Two features account for this variation. First, there are two main gaps in the nsp9 alignment (i.e., stretches of little sequence identity) located at loops connecting \u03b2\u2010strands \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b24\u2013\u03b25, based upon solved nsp9 structures. Second, the low similarity of pairwise sequence alignment was mainly derived from Beluga Whale CoV (similarity ranged from 24.8% to 56.8%). However, the C\u2010terminal halves of nsp9 proteins (residues 67\u2013111), which include \u03b2\u2010strands \u03b26\u2013\u03b27 and helix \u03b11, displayed much higher sequence similarity than the rest of the proteins [Fig. 1(C)]. There are 16 conserved residues located in this region, of which \u223c70% are hydrophobic [Fig. 1(D)], suggesting that this region is vital for the physiological function of nsp9.",

At first, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was applied to wild\u2010type and mutant IBV nsp9s to evaluate their oligomerization states. Molecular weights were calculated from a standard calibration curve. SEC analysis revealed that wild\u2010type nsp9 had a molecular weight of 20 kDa, close to the theoretical molecular weight of a nsp9 dimer (25 kDa) [Fig. 3(A)]. However, the nsp9 mutants (F73G, L86G, F88G, I95D, G98D, and G102D) exhibited a larger retention volume, which corresponds to a smaller molecular weight (Fig. 3, Supporting Information Fig. S3). These results indicate that mutations to the dimeric interface of nsp9 disrupt dimer formation. We also studied it by a second approach, glutaraldehyde crosslinking of nsp9 proteins (both wile\u2010type and mutants). However, the results from this study were not very clear, although a decreased dimeric portion for mutant G98D was observed with wild\u2010type nsp9 (Supporting Information Fig. S4 and Table S7)",

Since the above two commonly used methods did not give us a clear and consistent conclusion, we continued pursuing more sensitive and quantitative approaches. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2010MS) was used as a third way. It verified the molechular weight of all recombinant proteins.However, mixtures of dimers and monomers were detected in all samples (Supporting Information Table S4 and Fig. S5), indicating that the dimer and monomer forms may be in an equilibrium. This also implied that ESI\u2010MS is such a sensitive technique that even a tiny fraction of any oligomeric state can be detected.We further adopted analytical ultracentrifugation,which is a method not widely available but mor accurate, to precisely characterize the monomer\u2010dimer equilibrium for wild\u2010type and mutant nsp9 (F73G, L86G, F88G, I95D, G98D, and G102D) (Supporting Information Fig. S6 and Table S5). Sedimentation coefficients for the F73G, G98D, and I95D mutants revealed that these proteins are less able to form a dimer than the wild\u2010type protein, and therefore tend to remain in the monomeric state. The other mutants (L86G, F88G, and G102D) had oligomerization states similar to wild\u2010type nsp9. These data imply that F73 (from the hydrophobic surface), as well as I95 and G98 (from \u03b11) are more important for IBV nsp9 dimerization than the other tested positions (L86, F88, and G102).",

The first approach was biolayer interferometry (BLI). In this assay, biotinylated RNA was immobilized on streptavidin biosensor tips34, 35 and nsp9 was added at various concentrations (6.25\u2013100 \u03bcM) to establish association and dissociation rates [Fig. 4(C,D)]. The BLI data provided an overall affinity value (Kd) of 28 \u03bcM for the interaction between wild\u2010type nsp9 and RNA. These biosensor binding data also showed that the F73G, G98D, and I95D mutants could not bind RNA [Fig. 4(D)]. These data suggest that the dimeric form of nsp9 is required for nsp9\u2010RNA interactions. The second method we used was surface plasmon resonance (SPR),21 which is also a chip\u2010based immobilized affinity detection technique similar to BLI, but using a different detector. Using SPR, we measured wild\u2010type nsp9\u2010RNA binding affinity at 3.6 \u03bcM, very similar to the data from BLI measurements [Supporting Information Fig. S7(C)]. In addition, the three nsp9 mutants (F73D, I95D, and G98D) exhibited dramatically reduced RNA association rates [Supporting Information Fig. S7(D)], which is consistent with the BLI observations. In summary, these data indicate that nsp9 mutants (F73D, I95D, and G98D) that cannot dimerize also lose the ability to bind RNA and single\u2010stranded DNA.",

For Form\u2010B, the lack of sequence conservation in the critical protein region, and the small interaction surface, make it unlikely that Form\u2010B is a conserved dimeric conformation of CoV. Form\u2010C, which is seen in 229E\u2010CoV nsp9 wild\u2010type dimers, is characteristic of a novel disulfide\u2010linked homodimer formed by two antiparallel \u03b1\u2010helixes. Noticeably, Cys69 is conserved in nsp9s of alpha\u2010, beta\u2010 and gamma\u2010CoVs (including IBV and SARS\u2010CoV).

To investigate the possibility that IBV nsp9 dimerization could be prevented by a single mutation in the \u03b1\u2010helix, three conserved residues (I95, G98, and G102) involved in the helix\u2010helix association were mutated. All three nsp9 mutants (I95D, G98D, and G102D) exhibited a monomer\u2010dimer equilibrium in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and ESI\u2010MS. This implies that each point mutation lessened the degree of nsp9 dimerization, but did not completely eliminate it. This is particularly true for the I95 and G98 nsp9 mutants. Therefore, nsp9 homodimerization may be disrupted by targeting conserved residues within the helix\u2010helix interface. These data provide further evidence that the Form\u2010A conformation is the common state of nsp9 dimers. Zachary et al. also showed that mutations to the \u03b1\u2010helix in SARS\u2010CoV nsp9 were lethal to the virus.25 Although the same mutations would presumably affect the interaction between the C\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helices in both Forms A and C, because Form C involves a disulfide bridge which is uncommon to nsp9s in four CoV genera, we consider that Form\u2010A state of nsp9 is biologically relevant.",

Good fits were obtained by averaging results for the fractional content of secondary structures of nsp9 wild\u2010type calculated from X\u2010ray structure data by DSSP 2.0.42\n",
