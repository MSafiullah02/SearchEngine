            "text": "The presence in the bone marrow of memory CD8 T cells is well recognized. However, it is still largely unclear how T-cell migration from the lymphoid periphery to the bone marrow is regulated. In the present report, we show that antigen-specific CD4 T cells, as well as antigen-specific CD8 T cells, localize to the bone marrow of immunized mice, and are sustained there over long periods of time. To investigate the rules governing T-cell migration to the bone marrow, we generated chimeric mice in which the lymphoid periphery contained two genetically or phenotypically distinct groups of T cells, one of which was identical to the host. We then examined whether a distinct type of T cell had an advantage over the others in the colonization of bone marrow. Our results show that whereas ICAM1 and CD18 molecules are both involved in homing to lymph nodes, neither is crucial for Tcell bone marrow colonization. We also observed that memory-phenotype CD44 high T cells, but not virgin-type CD44 \u00c0/low T cells, preferentially home to the bone marrow upon adoptive transfer to normal young mice, but not to thymectomized old recipients where an existing memory T-cell pool precludes their free access. Thus, T-cell colonization of the bone marrow uses distinct molecules from those implicated in lymph node homing, and is regulated both by the properties of the T cell and by the competitive efficacy of other T cells inhabiting the same, saturable niche. This implies that the homing potential of an individual lymphocyte is not merely an intrinsic property of the cell, but rather a property of the lymphoid system taken as a whole.",

            "text": "For the induction and the accomplishment of effective immune responses, it is essential that lymphocytes traffic through lymphoid and extra-lymphoid organs in a regulated way. 1, 2 The migration of T cells from blood stream into tissues occurs via rolling or primary adhesion, activation, secondary adhesion, and diapedesis. Furthermore, the maintenance of both structure and function of the immune system relies on regulated T-cell homing to specific microenvironments within lymphoid tissues, representing specialized sites for cellular interactions. 1, 2 Integrins and chemokines are key molecular players in T-cell trafficking. Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric proteins acting as receptors for cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix ligands. T lymphocytes constitutively express CD11a/ CD18 (integrin a L b 2 , also called LFA1) which recognizes adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, notably CD102 (also called ICAM2), that is constitutively expressed by endothelial cells, and CD54 (also called ICAM1), that is expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and up-regulated on several cell types, including endothelial cells, during inflammation. 1, 2 Following activation, T cells display increased levels of CD11a/CD18 and may also express other integrins including CD11b/CD18 (integrin a M b 2 , also called Mac-1) 3 and CD49d/ CD29 (integrin a 4 b 1 , also called VLA4); 4 hence, these molecules have been used as markers to discriminate between virgin and effector/memory T cells. 5 Chemokines compose a family of small proteins, released by several cell types including endothelial cells, that act as chemoattractants. As with the integrins, cell activation provokes T cells to express an altered repertoire of chemokine receptors. The functional consequences of these various changes are that memory T cells, compared with virgin T cells, have an increased capacity to bind to APC and to endothelial cells in inflamed sites, but a lower tendency to migrate to lymph nodes. 6, 7 Experimental studies in sheep demonstrated that naive T cells enter the lymph nodes mostly from blood and exit through the efferent lymph. 8 In contrast, memory T cells are abundant in the afferent lymph, suggesting that they extravasate from blood into tissues and then home to lymph nodes, thereby patrolling the extra-lymphoid organs. 8 Furthermore, memory T cells are heterogeneous and phenotypically distinct cell subsets show the tendency to home to different extra-lymphoid tissues. [9] [10] [11] Recently, the differential expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 was used to identify two groups of memory T cells in human blood, which, it was proposed, might represent two distinct subsets, specialized either in effector function in extralymphoid organs or in memory maintenance in lymphoid organs. 12 However, this hypothesis has been challenged by two thorough studies on human CD4 and CD8 T cells, demonstrating that a single chemokine receptor is insufficient for Tcell subset definition and suggesting that effector and memory T cells cannot reliably be classified on the basis of the currently available markers. 13, 14 In an attempt to improve our understanding of memory T cells, we have focused on their homing and anatomical localization. Although many studies of memory T cells have focused on those derived from the spleen and/or extralymphoid organs such as the gut, we and others have observed that memory T cells are found in the bone marrow. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] In particular, we showed that antigen-specific CD8 T cells can still be detected in the bone marrow for several months after immunization. 21 Thus the capacity of CD8 T cells to migrate to the bone marrow and assume long-term residence in this site may be an important aspect of immunological memory. Here we have investigated whether migration to the bone marrow is restricted to memory CD8 T cells or whether it is also a property of antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Additionally, we have undertaken adoptive transfer experiments to demonstrate that entry into the bone marrow is competitive, and exploiting this fact, illustrate properties of T cells that are either relevant or irrelevant to long-term bone marrow colonization.",

B6 female mice were immunized by two subcutaneous injections of 50 mg OVA 257-264 and 140 mg HBVc 128-140 peptides emulsified in either complete (CFA) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). 21, 24 ELISPOT Spleen, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes, tibiae and femurs from control and primed mice were collected from 2 weeks to 2 months after immunization. Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen and lymph nodes by mechanical disruption and passage through cell strainers and from tibiae and femurs by syringe insertion into one end of the bone and flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For the CD8 T-cell response, we incubated cells harvested from either control or primed mice (responder cells) in anti-interferon-g monoclonal antibody (IFN-g mAb) precoated multiscreen plates with interleukin-2 (IL-2) at 20 U/ml and 500 000 irradiated syngeneic spleen cells, prepulsed with either OVA 257-264 peptide at 10 mg/ml or medium alone. For the CD4 T-cell response, we incubated the responder cells in anti-IFN-g mAb-precoated multiscreen plates with 500 000 irradiated syngeneic spleen cells and either HBVc 128-140 peptide at 50 mg/ml or medium alone. Responder spleen and lymph node cells were 250 000/ well, bone marrow cells were 500 000/well. In some experiments, the anti-I-A b mAb AF6-120.1.2 was used as ascites at a 1:20 final dilution in the culture medium.

Such rapid homing is mediated mostly by the interaction between the T cell VLA4 integrin and the bone marrow CD106 (also called VCAM1) adhesion molecule, with a minor role played by the CD11a/CD18 (LFA1) and its ICAM ligands. 28, 29 However, the potential contribution of CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, or ICAM1 to interstitial migration and prolonged localization of T cells in the bone marrow has not been assessed. To this end, we performed a series of long-term migration experiments. First, we injected CFSE-labelled spleen and lymph node cells from B6 mice into age-and sex-matched recipients and analysed the distribution of donor T cells into spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow from 1 to 3 weeks later. By performing adoptive transfer into non-irradiated recipient mice, we tested the ability of donor T cells to displace the recipient T cells in each of the three organs. Figure 2(a) shows the typical gates for cell acquisition and flow cytometry analysis used in our experiments. One week after adoptive transfer, the percentage of donor T cells found in the lymph node T-cell pool was approximately the same as that found in the spleen, whereas that in the bone marrow was about one half of this (Fig. 2b) . This same pattern of T-cell distribution persisted at 10 days (Fig. 2b) , and up to 19 days after transfer (data not shown), and was highly reproducible from experiment to experiment (see Table 1 , below). Moreover, similar findings were obtained when we injected donor cells by either the intravenous or intraperitoneal route (data not shown). These results indicate that bone marrow seeding by donor T cells is a controlled process that does not directly parallel colonization of secondary lymphoid organs.",

These findings mirrored those obtained with the combination of age-and sex-matched donor and recipient B6 mice (Fig. 2b) . In contrast, ITGB2ko T cells had a significant disadvantage relative to B6 T cells in lymph node colonization compared to spleen colonization (ratio 0\u00c194, compared to 1\u00c147; Fig. 3a , Table 1 ), while B6 cell homing into lymph nodes in ICAM1ko recipient mice was likewise disadvantaged compared to that into the spleen (ratio 0\u00c187 compared to 1\u00c137; Fig. 3b , Table 1 ). These data are consistent with the roles reported for CD18 on T cells and ICAM1 on high endothelial cells in short-term lymph node homing. 28 By contrast, although wild-type T cells had some disadvantage in entering the bone marrow compared to the spleen when transferred into ITGB2ko recipient mice, neither CD18 nor ICAM1 substantially affect bone marrow localization.",

In sum, our results indicate that in a competitive setting, memory T cells have an advantage over virgin T cells in colonization of the bone marrow, whereas virgin T cells have an advantage over memory T cells in lodging into lymph nodes. This conclusion is supported by the finding that T cells derived from thymectomized old mice do not show improved bone marrow colonization in thymectomized old recipients, where existing memory-type T cells presumably preclude their free access.

This finding, together with the observation that memory-phenotype T cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes, suggest that bone marrow is an important site of memory T-cell trafficking and prolonged localization. Although activated T cells up-regulate LFA1 and can express Mac-1, 3 our results demonstrate that these integrins are not involved in sustained memory T-cell lodging in the bone marrow, in agreement with previous short-term studies. 28 The finding of memory-phenotype T cells in the bone marrow after adoptive transfer seemingly excludes the possibility that T-cell localization in the bone marrow is the result of the local presence of antigen. Moreover, because LFA1 and ICAM1 are not required for prolonged T-cell lodging into the bone marrow, it is unlikely that antigen presentation and APC-T-cell interactions sustain T cells in the bone marrow 'niche'.",

            "text": "The advantage shown by memory type cells over virgin cells in migration to the bone marrow bears obvious parallels with memory T-cell homing into extra-lymphoid organs. It is interesting that the interaction between VLA4 and VCAM1 is involved in effector/memory T-cell migration both to inflamed tissues and to bone marrow. 29 T-cell homing into peripheral tissues has commonly been considered to be induced by inflammation, whereas migration of memory T cells to the bone marrow is considered to be a constitutive component of their recirculation within the lymphoid system. However, recent reports have shown high levels of constitutive memory T-cell lodging into extra-lymphoid organs in the absence of overt inflammation, 31, 32 and it has been demonstrated that epithelial cells produce homeostatic chemokines able to attract T lymphocytes at the body surfaces (reviewed in ref. 33 ). Building on this, an interesting model proposes that T lymphocytes traffic into extra-lymphoid organs through two main pathways with two distinct protective functions. 33 The first, constitutive pathway regulates T-cell homing to skin and gut, large epithelial surfaces relentlessly exposed to pathogens and constitutively patrolled by T cells. The second pathway controls T-cell migration to internal organs, such as the kidney or liver, which are usually protected from pathogen attack and infiltrated by T cells only in the case of inflammation. 33 In this context, we propose that memory T cells involved in the second pathway also recirculate through the bone marrow, and that this may be important for their long-term survival/proliferation, in a similar manner to the mechanisms reported for plasma cells. 21, [34] [35] [36] [37] A candidate chemokine involved in the selective attraction of memory T cells to the bone marrow is stromal cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a), a potent chemoattractant for haemopoietic progenitor cells. 38 Indeed, although both memory and virgin T cells express the SDF-1a receptor CXCR4, 2,10,13 the percentage of cells showing a functional response to SDF-1a is higher in the memory T-cell subset than in the virgin T-cell subset, as indicated by the results of an in vitro assay for transendothelial migration. 39 Our results on the different bone marrow colonization capabilities of T cells derived from thymectomized old mice and young donors, respectively, suggest that migration to the bone marrow is associated with a memory T-cell phenotype rather then with recent antigen activation. Thus, it is unlikely that T cells migrate to the bone marrow only during a restricted time window after priming. In contrast, a conceivable scenario is that, among the T cells constantly circulating in the lymphoid periphery, those with memory phenotype preferentially migrate to the bone marrow. We speculate that these cells persist in the bone marrow for enough time to receive survival/proliferation signals which might be relevant for the maintenance of longterm memory. At least for memory CD8 T cells, IL-15 and IL-7 might provide these signals, as they are expressed at high levels in the bone marrow and have been involved in CD8 T-cell homeostasis. 40 Most probably, the cells also return to the periphery from the bone marrow as they are displaced by other memory T cells competing for the same enclosed 'niche'. Indeed, the clear impact of the recipient phenotype on the capability of cells to enter the bone marrow indicates that the bone marrow compartment for T cells is limited and saturable. In sum, our results support the idea that colonization of specific lymphoid environments is favoured by the expression of a memory phenotype and inhibited by the competition with other rival T cells. [41] [42] [43] [44] This implies that the homing potential of an individual lymphocyte is not merely an inherent property of the cell, but rather a property of the lymphoid system as a whole.",

Cells were labelled with CFSE and injected intraperitoneally into either normal young or thymectomized old B6 mice (numbers of cells per recipient mouse: 25-33 million cells from normal young donors; 43-57 million cells from thymectomized old donors; different numbers of total cells from the two type of donors were injected per recipient mouse to compensate for the lower percentages of T cells found in the periphery of thymectomized old compared to young mice, see also in the text). (a) The two panels represent the phenotype of donor T cells from either young or thymectomized old B6 mice (tx \u00bc thymectomized). (b) After 7-10 days from adoptive transfer, spleen, lymph node and bone marrow cells were purified from recipient mice and analysed as in Fig. 2. The ratio between the percentages of lymph node and spleen CFSE \u00fe T cells and that between the percentages of bone marrow and spleen CFSE \u00fe T cells of individual mice are represented, as well as the average value of each group (summary of four experiments). Statistical analysis was performed using Students' t-test and differences were considered significant when P 0\u00c1001 (***), P 0\u00c101 (**) and P 0\u00c105 (*). Two series of data were considered at a time: first versus second group (*LN/ spleen); first versus third group (**LN/spleen; ***bm/spleen); first versus forth group (***LN/spleen; *** bm/spleen); second versus third group (* LN/spleen; *** bm/spleen); second versus forth group (***LN/ spleen; ***bm/spleen). (c) The panels represent the FL1 histograms of donor CFSE \u00fe TCR \u00fe cells from spleen and bone marrow of a representative mouse for each group. The scale on the x-axis is logarithmic, in arbitrary units. The numbers represent the percentage of cells in the marked region. Similar percentages were obtained when analysis was performed on lymph node cells.",
