If your ultrasound machine does not have a lung preset, use the abdominal or cardiac preset with tissue harmonic imaging and multi-beam (MB) settings turned off. By turning off these settings, ultrasound artefacts, which are the basis of lung ultrasound, will become more prominent. Patients with COVID-19 commonly have lung ultrasound findings: B lines with variable appearance (including focal, multifocal, and confluent), subpleural consolidations (Figure 1), pleural thickening or irregularity, and larger consolidations with occasional air bronchograms. A multi-lobar distribution of abnormalities is common. Ultrasound B lines correspond to the typical ground glass opacities visualized on CT imaging. Pleural effusions, other than small localized effusions, are rare. Abnormalities are most commonly visualized in the posterior and inferior lung fields.1\u20133\n",
