The three puppies were siblings. Each was from a different litter by the same breeding pair. The puppy in case one was seen by the authors, and the puppies in cases two and three were patients at other veterinary hospitals. However, the medical records and radiographs were examined and reviewed for this report. Radiographic investigation of the lameness revealed pathognomonic appearance of MO affecting the metaphyseal region of the long bones in all three puppies.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] MO has been reported to occur in more than 40 different breeds (including mixed breeds), with the only cases in nonlarge-breed dogs being single cases in the following breeds: Australian Cattle Dog, Bichon Frise, Cairn Terrier, Chow Chow, Wire-haired Fox Terrier, Maltese, Miniature Poodle, Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier and Shar-Pei. 4, 6 Clinical signs of MO typically occur at 3-4 months of age, with varying degrees of lameness, depression and inappetence. In more severe cases, systemic signs, such as gastrointestinal, respiratory and/or neurological signs, occur. 4, 7, 8 Physical examination reveals pain on palpation of the metaphyseal region of the long bones, often with pyrexia. 1,2 MO is typically a self-limiting disease that resolves around the time of skeletal maturity, with mildly affected animals considered to have a good to excellent prognosis. However, the prognosis is guarded for severely affected animals, in which recurrence of pain, pyrexia and inappetence results in severe debilitation, leading to death or euthanasia. 1, 2 A clinical diagnosis of MO is based on signalment, history, physical examination and characteristic radiographic changes in the metaphyseal region of the long bones, most notable of which is a radiolucent line in the metaphysis just proximal and parallel to a narrow zone of increased radiodensity adjacent to the physis. 2, 9 The bones most commonly affected in MO are the distal radius, ulna and tibia, but it has also been reported to occur in the mandible, maxilla, skull, vertebra, scapula, humerus, femur and ribs. 1, 4 Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology, with characteristic suppurative inflammation and extensive necrosis in the metaphyseal region of the long bones being seen. However, biopsy or necropsy is not typically performed, because of the pathognomonic radiographic changes and because many puppies recover from the disease before biopsy is considered. 2, 7, 10 Treatment of MO involves anti-inflammatory/analgesic therapy generally by use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Supportive therapy in the form of intravenous fluids and assisted nutrition may be necessary in more severe cases. 2 MO has not previously been reported in the Australian Kelpie, which is considered a medium-breed dog, with an average height of 47 cm at the withers. 11 We report three cases of MO in Australian Kelpie siblings, two of which were euthanased because of the severe or recurring clinical signs.",

After 48 h, treatment with prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO every 12 h; Prednisolone, Apex Laboratories, Somersby, NSW, Australia) was also started. The day after commencing prednisolone treatment, the puppy was bright, alert and responsive, with moderate improvement in gait, a return to normothermia and no discomfort on palpation of the metaphyses of the long bones. Continued improvement was seen, with resolution of all clinical signs 2 days after commencing the new treatment. After 5 days, the prednisolone dose rate was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h and treatment with tramadol was discontinued. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after a 7-day course. After 1 week, the prednisolone dose rate was further reduced to 0.5 mg/kg every 24 h, which continued to control the clinical signs for an additional 7 days, at which point the lameness and reluctance to stand recurred. The prednisolone dose rate was increased to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h, with a subsequent resolution of clinical signs. Over the following 6 weeks, repeated attempts to wean the prednisolone resulted in the recurrence of clinical signs. It was at this point, given the difficulty in controlling the clinical signs, that the puppy's owners elected euthanasia.",

In the Weimaraner, the disease has been reported to occur in littermates and also closely related animals. 9,10 It has been reported that Weimaraner puppies with MO that have an affected littermate are more likely to have relapses of the disease. 9 These observations have led to a general acceptance that there is a significant inheritable component of the disease in this breed, but the mode of inheritance remains unknown. 4, [8] [9] [10] 15 The literature commonly reports the development of MO within several weeks of vaccination. 3, 4, [8] [9] [10] 15, 16 However, only one study has been conducted to investigate the link between recent vaccination and the onset of MO. That study investigated whether there was an association between the canine leucocyte antigen DQ1A allele of the major histocompatibility complex and the development of clinical MO in Weimaraners, but no association was found. 16 In the current report, all three puppies had received a vaccination within the 2 weeks prior to development of clinical signs. Although this might suggest a possible vaccine association, it must be noted that the typical age of onset of MO is 3-4 months of age, and that vaccines are routinely administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age, so there is likely always to be a temporal association between the development of MO and recent vaccination in all affected breeds. Although some have speculated that there is a link between vaccination and the development of MO, 8, 9, 15 without evidence from a controlled trial no conclusions can be drawn.",
