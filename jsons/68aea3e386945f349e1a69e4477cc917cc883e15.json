One critical area where children's voices have been minimised is in the planning for future pandemics. This paper presents a subset of data from a programme of research which examined various stakeholder experiences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks of 2003. These data also generated recommendations for future pandemic planning. Specifically, this paper will examine the perspectives and recommendations of children hospitalised during SARS in a large paediatric hospital in Canada. Twenty-one (n = 21) child and adolescent participants were interviewed from a variety of medical areas including cardiac (n = 2), critical care (n = 2), organ transplant (n = 4), respiratory medicine (n = 8) and infectious diseases (patients diagnosed with suspected or probable SARS; n = 5). Data analyses exposed a range of children's experiences associated with the outbreaks as well as recommendations for future pandemic planning. Key recommendations included specific policies and guidelines concerning psychosocial care, infection control, communication strategies and the management of various resources. This paper is guided by a conceptual framework comprised of theories from child development and literature on children's rights. The authors call for greater youth participation in healthcare decision-making and pandemic planning.",

            "text": "A current and important issue within health-care involves the development of pandemic plans. A pandemic outbreak is a result of an infectious disease that spreads rapidly throughout the world in a short period of time. Pandemics arise from a significant antigenic shift mutating the genetic makeup of a virus, manifesting in infection where immunity may be nonexistent or limited in the population (Schoenbaum 2001 , Cinti 2005 , AAP 2007 . Historically, pandemics wreak social, psychological and economic havoc in a region, often resulting in widespread illness and mortality (Paget & Aguilera 2001 , Cox et al. 2003 , Anderson & McFarlane 2004 , Doyle et al. 2006 . Although the expected impact of a pandemic will vary based on geographic location and population, there remains international consensus on the inevitability of a future crisis (Snacken 2002 , Cox et al. 2003 , Schabas 2003 , PHAC 2006 . It is estimated that pandemics will cause infection in 25% of the world's population and will result in 2-7.4 million deaths (WHO 2005) . For these reasons, it is imperative to redress previous experiences and implement sustainable disaster planning for future pandemics (Couch 1999 , Anderson & McFarlane 2004 , Cinti 2005 , Cox et al. 2003 , WHO 2005 , PHAC 2006 .",

For one, children often respond differently to viruses than adults and this can include both physical symptoms and psychological responses. In the case of SARS, for example, children were not affected to the same degree as adults. Specifically, symptoms used to identify infected adults with SARS were not present in infected children or adolescents (Wong et al. 2003) and adult vaccines and antiviral medications administered to paediatric populations were deemed ineffective (AAP 2005) . In addition, infection control practices that were unpleasant for adult patients had a devastating emotional impact on paediatric patients (Koller et al. 2006b ). Accordingly, the lessons learned from SARS can inform pandemic plans which more adequately address the unique needs and perspectives of children (Koller et al. 2006a,b) .",

Furthermore, 'there remains a uniqueness that begs for the care of children to be identified and included in the extensive efforts to explore our nation's readiness for influenza pandemic' (AAP 2005, p.1). Notably absent, however, is consultation with the children for whom such policies are intended to serve (CAPHC 2006 , AAP 2007 , Trust for America's Health 2007). The purpose of this paper was to present a portion of qualitative data from a programme of research where children and adolescents were asked to share their experiences during the SARS outbreaks and provide recommendations for future pandemic planning.

In this case, we exceeded this threshold to ensure participants had a variety of diagnoses. Participants comprised patients who received hospital treatment during the period of strict infection control practices (7 March 7 to 12 August 2003). Specifically, participants consisted of patients treated for SARS (n = 5), respiratory conditions (n = 8), terminal illness or palliative care (n = 2), and transplantation (n = 6). In addition, participants came from a range of religious and cultural backgrounds (i.e. Muslim, Jewish, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) and were highly representative of the patient population within this large, urban paediatric hospital (for a description of sample demographics, see Table 1 ).",

(16-year-old female) Some participants recognised the extent to which healthcare providers were emotionally affected by the SARS outbreaks. They also believed that staff needed to minimise children's fears by maintaining a sense of normalcy despite their own concerns. Participants recommended that staff keep a balanced perspective and remain calm in order to help children cope with the crisis. Therefore, over-reacting to the situation was viewed as counterproductive. A 14-year-old male said, 'staff shouldn't get too worried or over-reactive', while an 11year-old female indicated, 'staff should help kids forget about it, like think of something else, cause thinking about it is going to make you mad, it's going to make you scared'.",

It is important to be professional, but it's also important to have a heart. Like remember that these are kids and they have needs, and need to feel wanted, loved and cared for. (16-year-old female) In keeping with patients being treated as children first, many participants identified play and distraction as an important component of psychosocial care, particularly during a crisis. By having activities in their rooms, children could be distracted from what was happening around them.

Furthermore, these responsibilities transcended all levels of government including local, provincial and federal. Some participants expressed the need for individuals to sublimate their own needs in order to protect the community as a whole. It was suggested that individuals learn to maintain a level of vigilance by encouraging people to dress warmly when necessary, to maintain hand washing practices and to avoid highly contagious public places. One adolescent offered the following advice: You got to take it seriously, but then again not too seriously. You have to be cautious and if you are feeling sick don't wait, go to the nearest clinic even if it is not the hospital but a walk-in. Just go so that you know you are not infecting yourself and more so everyone else. A lot of kids get sick and go to school. They don't tell their parents and they don't care that they are infecting other people. You never know, so you have to take the risk that people have common courtesy and are cautious themselves.

In such an environment, children experienced a lack of information or discrepant messages about the nature, transmission and outcome of the disease.
