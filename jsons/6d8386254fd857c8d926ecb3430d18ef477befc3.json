            "text": "AIDS was first reported as a \"gay-related immune deficiency\" in 1981, but soon was identified in other risk groups including sex workers, Haitian entrants to the United States, and injection drug users. 3, 4 Evidence for transfusion transmission emerged in 1982 when a few cases of AIDS were reported in hemophilia patients and later in transfusion recipients. However, despite a number of high-level federal meetings, actions by the national government to contain the AIDS risk from transfusion were not undertaken until 1983. 8 Although transfusion transmission of HIV undoubtedly took place at least 5 years before the recognition of TAA due to the very long asymptomatic period of the disease, the delay in a response to TAA subsequent to these initial reports of disease in persons with hemophilia and transfusion recipients also contributed to the AIDS tragedy. Rage within the hemophilia community, due both to the fact of transmission of a fatal infection and to the failure of authorities to provide adequate warnings and preventions, was expressed in a demand for a congressional investigation. Members of Congress instead directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to look into the matter. This was accomplished through a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study the evolving HIV-related events impacting blood safety and the decision-making process in this crisis period. In its report, entitled \"HIV and the Blood Supply: An Analysis of Crisis Decision Making (1995),\" 9 the IOM found no wrongdoing by organizations or officials, but identified failed opportunities to better protect public health. These failures to act more rapidly and aggressively in the face of TAA were seen to unmask an underlying weakness in the ability of federal agencies to address a new threat in the face of substantial scientific uncertainty. This weakness was attributed to systemic deficiencies, primarily of leadership and coordination. In particular, the IOM criticized the federal agencies for lack of top-level leadership needed to overcome inherent bureaucratic inertia; absence of a systematic approach within advisory committees sufficient to maintain their focus; over dependency on the regulated industry as a source of data given the inherent conflict of interest; and failure to engage in forward thinking both with respect to new technologies and emerging safety threats. As a consequence, the risk of TAA was severely underestimated; patients and care providers were not suitably warned of the risk; and resistance to a change in the status quo caused delayed intervention. In a set of 14 recommendations directed primarily at federal agencies, the IOM called for a more responsive and integrated decision-making process including establishment of a Blood Safety Council reporting to a designated Blood Safety Director within HHS and a standing \"expert panel\" to assure communication of blood product risks and alternatives to their use both to care providers and to the public. Specifically to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the IOM recommended that, \"Where uncertainties or countervailing public health concerns preclude eliminating potential risks, the FDA should encourage, and where necessary require, the blood industry to implement partial solutions that have little risk of causing harm.\" While not itself a mandate, the IOM's admonition that the FDA should institute measured precautions in the face of uncertainty has become a dominant factor in blood safety decision making. A more vigilant and proactive FDA approach to blood safety unfortunately has had the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing the manufacturing costs and therefore the price of blood. 10",

The present structure includes the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) as the blood safety director; heads of Public Health Service and related agencies as members of a Blood, Organ and Tissue Safety Executive Council (BOTSEC); and an HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee for Blood and Tissue Safety and Availability (formerly the Advisory Committee for Blood Safety and Availability). The ASH is the acknowledged national blood safety director with final responsibility and authority for decisions regarding blood safety and availability. An interagency Blood, Organ and Tissue Safety Working Group meets monthly by teleconference, more often when necessary, and the BOTSEC meets approximately quarterly face to face with the ASH to provide information and guidance regarding current and emerging issues involving the nation's blood supply. 11 Unlike FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee, whose function is to provide external scientific advice relevant to regulation, the Secretary's advisory committee is empowered to discuss broad legal, ethical, social, and economic issues affecting the blood system. To give voice to patient concerns, both advisory committees seat voting representatives of communities that have been particularly affected by TAA. Additionally, in response to a series of congressional hearings, reports from the Government Accountability Office, and the IOM study, the FDA developed and HHS subsequently adopted a comprehensive \"blood action plan\" 12 designed to address the identified shortcomings, to ensure greater coordination among the department's public health agencies, and to increase the effectiveness of the FDA's scientific and regulatory activities. Notably, the post-TAA era has witnessed an aggressive effort by the FDA to improve blood safety through enforcement of cGMP in blood product collection and processing aligned with the model of pharmaceutical manufacturing and a more formal relationship than blood establishments experienced in the past. The FDA initiative also involved promotion of automation to reduce human errors, including use of validated blood bank software. An intensive program of field inspections designed to assure universal regulatory compliance of blood collection establishments resulted in a number of court-enforced voluntary injunctions (consent decrees).",

The evidence for transmission of the \"AIDS agent\" through blood was further strengthened in December 1982 by the report of a 20-month-old infant in San Francisco who had developed unexplained immunodeficiency after transfusion of multiple blood products to treat erythroblastosis fetalis. 4 One of the blood donors was a man who was healthy at the time of donation, but subsequently died of AIDS.",

From the CDC perspective, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss how to reduce the risk of AIDS in transfusion recipients and persons with hemophilia in the absence of a test for the etiologic agent. Several possible strategies were presented, including deferral of blood donations by persons known to be at increased risk for AIDS and the use of surrogate tests to identify persons at increased risk of transmission, such as those with detectable antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) or low CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios. However, the meeting turned into a contentious debate about the existence of AIDS in transfusion recipients and persons with hemophilia, and no agreement was reached on a risk reduction strategy.",

In particular, restricting blood donation by homosexual men was seen as a civil rights issue, and deferring donations by Haitian entrants undoubtedly led to discrimination against Haitian Americans.

Bulk preparations of the virus, known at the time as HTLV-III, were provided by the National Cancer Institute to diagnostics companies for the development of antibody detection tests. The first such screening test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, was approved by the FDA in March 1985. Because of concerns that persons would donate blood for the purpose of learning their HIV infection status, the CDC funded the first alternative HIV test sites, where individuals could obtain free and confidential testing. Blood banks also established the option of confidential unit exclusion to allow persons who had donated blood to confidentially indicate that the blood should not be used for transfusion. A watershed event in blood safety was the statement by the FDA commissioner at a September 1994 workshop that nucleic acid technology should be implemented to close the window period for HIV detection by serology. This technology had been considered too costly and cumbersome for practical application in blood banking. The introduction of direct testing for HIV in donor blood, first by p24 antigen assays, which proved largely unproductive, 13 and then by nucleic acid tests (NATs) for viral RNA, which proved beneficial, put to rest a decade of concern about residual HIV risk from donations in the 3-to 6-week infectious \"window period\" before seroconversion dependent on the sensitivity of different screening tests. The successful adaptation of NAT to donor screening, including testing of specimens in small pools of 16 to 24, established a new era in risk reduction from transfusiontransmitted viral diseases. In addition to increasing the safety of transfused blood, HIV antibody screening of donors led to \"lookback\" programs in which recipients of previous unscreened donations from infected donors were identified. These recipients were found to be at substantial risk for infection. 14, 15 Although no effective treatment was available at the time, infected recipients could be counseled to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to others.",

The etiologic breakthrough began in the early 1960s with the discovery of the Australia antigen by Blumberg and coworkers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 19 This single finding changed the course of hepatitis history when in 1968, the Australia antigen was shown by the Blumberg group to be associated with viral hepatitis 20 and then by Prince and colleagues 21 to be specifically associated with hepatitis B. In England, Dane and coworkers 22 showed by immune electron microscopy that the Australia antigen represented the envelope protein of HBV and it was renamed the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The serologic distinctions between hepatitis A and B were further solidified by the controversial, but definitive prospective studies by Krugman and colleagues 23 at the Willowbrook State School. The US government played a pivotal role in these momentous events, first through the initial discovery of the Australia antigen in the intramural program at NIH and then through extensive grant support of the Blumberg laboratory at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia.",

[29] [30] [31] Despite the absence of a specific test for detecting the NANBH agent, TAH incidence declined because of the more judicious use of blood fostered by the recognition that NANBH could result in cirrhosis and death 32 and by the devastating consequences of transfusion-transmitted HIV. 5 Further, in the absence of specific NANBH assays, surrogate assays were advocated. The Transfusion Transmitted Virus Study, supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, published a retrospective analysis of a prospective study that showed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing of donors might effect a 30% reduction in TAH incidence. 33 This was confirmed by a similar analysis of the NIH prospective TAH study, 34 but implementation of ALT donor screening at the NIH failed to demonstrate the predicted benefit. 35 Similar retrospective testing of the Transfusion Transmitted Virus Study 36 and the NIH 37 prospective studies suggested that anti-HBc testing might result in a 30% to 40% reduction in TAH, and this fostered the voluntary introduction of ALT and anti-HBc donor testing in 1986 to 1987; the FDA recommended routine donor testing for anti-HBc in 1992. Although anti-HBc screening was introduced specifically to detect HBV carriers who were HBsAg negative (now termed occult hepatitis B), it also served as a surrogate for NANB carriers and for seronegative HIV carriers because of overlapping transmission routes. Had anti-HBc surrogate testing been introduced in the early 1980s it presumably would have prevented some cases of transfusion-transmitted AIDS and NANBH. This delayed implementation was the basis for extensive litigation, but also served as the driver for the IOM recommendation of invoking the \"precautionary principle\" when weighing new donor screening interventions and this precautionary approach has significantly improved transfusion safety.",

Using the then-novel technique of expression cloning, these investigators identified a single clone among millions tested that reacted with serum from patients with NANBH. Houghton and associates at Chiron then \"walked\" the genome, characterized an antigen derived from the nonstructural region of the viral genome, and developed an antibody assay to detect this viral protein. 39 Studies at the NIH 40 confirmed that the cloned agent, designated hepatitis C virus (HCV), was detected in virtually all NANBH cases and identified an implicated donor in near 90% of these cases. First-generation anti-HCV testing was introduced in 1990 and secondgeneration assays in 1992. Prospective studies at the NIH Clinical Center documented the virtual eradication of TAH by 1997; 35 mathematical modeling after the introduction of NAT screening in 1999 predicts that the current risk of transfusion-related hepatitis C is approximately one case in every 2 million transfusions, approximately the same risk as being hit by lightning.",

Four cases of unexplained fever and encephalitis in recipients of organ transplants from a common donor proved to be caused by WNV and raised the possibility of transmission through blood transfusion. Initial efforts to screen blood donors using signs and symptoms of WNV infection proved ineffective. 41 In 2002, a total of 4156 cases of human illness were reported, and at least 21 people contracted WNV through transfusion, six of whom died. 42 The rapid expansion of WNV across the United States and reported to BOTSEC by the CDC lent urgency to developing a screening test before the next epidemic season. 43 The FDA requested that industry develop such a test; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provided $3.47 million in research support; the American Red Cross provided 35,000 archived specimens; and the FDA facilitated rapid national test implementation and ultimate approval. Although development of blood screening tests usually takes years, the NAT assay for WNV was available for the 2003 epidemic season, building on technology platforms already developed for HIV and HCV. West Nile virus was the first acute infection with a short asymptomatic viremia and an epidemic spread to warrant routine donor testing and demonstrated a successful collaboration of government, blood collectors, and the diagnostics industry. 44, 45 A footnote to the WNV screening success was the recognition that testing of pooled samples was insufficiently sensitive to detect low-titer viremia in blood donations, including in the infectious preseroconversion donations commonly encountered during epidemic spread. However, universal testing of individual units in nonepidemic areas nationwide was inefficient and costly. This problem was solved through a novel strategy of triggering individual testing based on the yield of pool testing. This approach effectively detected and interdicted approximately 1400 potentially infectious blood donations during 2003 to 2005. 46",

The question of blood transmission was answered when the United Kingdom reported four cases of vCJD infections associated with blood transfusion that occurred between 2003 and 2007. 51 All four recipients had received transfusions of nonleukoreduced RBCs between 1996 and 1999, which confirmed the long incubation.

Nevertheless, to address public concerns as well as the dearth of scientific information regarding blood transmission, the FDA provided prudent but specific recommendations concerning donors with a confirmed medical diagnosis of anthrax or proven colonization with B. anthracis and provided criteria for product quarantine and retrieval related to reports of postdonation illness. 59",

Bacterial contamination of platelets is a clearly identified risk that is being addressed with \"partial solutions,\" culture, and point-of-issue serologic testing. 66 Hepatitis E virus is known to be transfusion transmitted, but potential disease burden has not been defined. 67 The geographic and travel exclusions to limit the risk of malaria transmission continue to be refined pending development of screening assays or pathogen reduction technology. Surveillance for the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome is active and the possibility that these agents as well as pandemic influenza and monkey pox might be transfusion transmitted or disrupt blood donation is unresolved. The possibility of seasonal and geographic-based donor screening with validated tests for dengue and babesiosis has been modeled even as pilot studies of screening assays are ongoing. 68, 69 Pathogen reduction technology offers an alternative approach to risk mitigation. Such technology would change the riskbenefit paradigm both for the known infectious agents and for those likely to threaten the blood supply in the future. 70 Federal decision makers are involved in deter-mining when and how this technology should be applied to the nation's blood and blood components.",

Manufacturers of blood components are now held accountable for meeting cGMP standards similar to those that apply to the manufacture of medical devices and pharmaceutical-type drugs. A new and arguably more responsive federal structure for addressing issues of blood safety and availability has been adopted. The decisionmaking structure places a premium on clear lines of authority, internal and public communication, flexibility, and coordination among the federal agencies with major roles in blood safety. Federal agencies have encouraged public discourse through workshops, joint initiatives with industry, and participation in public-private partnerships with professional societies and blood collectors. These adjustments have allowed federal agencies to respond with appropriate urgency to the differing situations posed by emerging infectious agents in the era since recognition of TAA 30 years ago. 71 ",
