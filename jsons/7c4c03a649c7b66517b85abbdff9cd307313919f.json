This induces inflammation resulting in damage to the airways and further impairment of mucociliary clearance. In many cases of bronchiectasis, a period of many months, years or even decades may precede the development of sufficient damage to appear as classical 'bronchiectasis' on a HRCT scan. The rate of damage progression is likely dependent on a number of factors: whether there is an underlying problem such as cystic fibrosis (CF), the extent (and type) of the pathogenic colonisation/infection, 3 the frequency of exacerbations, 4 access to healthcare, and the efficacy of, and adherence to, therapeutic interventions. In cystic fibrosis, for example, the appearance of bronchiectasis on HRCT scans has been greatly delayed with more aggressive anti-microbial therapy and strategies designed to enhance mucociliary clearance.",

            "text": "As noted above, the current paradigm suggests that there is a spectrum of disease associated with the presence and/or persistence of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways. In these children the cough is associated with bacterial infection and/or colonisation of the conducting airways. This ranges from being transient (after a viral lower respiratory tract infection) through to the patient with severe bronchiectasis described previously. A common thread is the presence of bacteria suggesting that this is a spectrum of disease in which the manifestations can vary markedly between and within individuals over time. Prior to the 'diagnosis' of 'idiopathic bronchiectasis' being made on the basis of a HRCT scan, the patient (children and adults) may have been labelled as having recurrent viral infections, asthma, and/or chronic bronchitis. [10] [11] [12] Yet it is likely the same disease process that caused them to be 'chesty' (with wet cough) from childhood. In two relatively large series (n = 103-150), most (60-80%) adults newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis (on HRCT) have had chronic wet cough or productive cough since childhood. 13, 14 Unfortunately the subject of how bronchiectasis evolves has received relatively little attention over the past 40 years. The high case numbers of bronchiectasis described in the 1940 s and 1950 s 2 with a seeming resurgence described from the 1990 s [15] [16] [17] suggests two possibilities. Either it was under-recognised in the intervening years, when there was a co-existing strong focus on asthma, or that the widespread use of oral antibiotics in early childhood to treat 'viral respiratory tract infections' also treated developing persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and/or pneumonia. Eradicating bacteria prior to the formation of biofilms is theoretically easier than after the biofilms have become established and in the same way many pneumonias were probably inadvertently treated so many cases of bacterial bronchitis were probably inadvertently prevented. We speculate that the reappearance of an old disease may in part be the unintended consequence of an appropriate attempt to reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute viral respiratory tract infections. The terminology used is also confusing as it suggests that there are different diseases rather than a spectrum of clinical phenotypes with a common underlying problem. The use of some of the diagnostic terms is discussed in next section and has been summarised in a previous review. 9",

            "text": "1. It is unknown when the radiological changes consistent with bronchiectasis occur in the context of a patient with symptoms of CSLD/bronchiectasis. Adult-based studies have shown that bronchography (the previous gold standard for diagnosis of bronchiectasis) is superior to HRCT scans especially in mild disease. 21, 22 Furthermore recent studies have shown that contiguous 1-mm slices are superior in diagnostic terms compared to conventional HRCT images (1 mm slice every 10 mm). 23 , 24 Hill et al reported that the contiguous 1-mm slices protocol (using multidetector CT scan) demonstrated 40 extra lobes with bronchiectasis not identified on conventional HRCT in 53 adults. 23 False negative results are more likely to occur when the disease is mild and localised. 21 As children are likely to have less severe bronchiectasis than adults, it is possible that the HRCT in a sub-group of children with clinical symptoms of bronchiectasis may still have insufficient sensitivity to detect early signs of this disorder. In addition it is more difficult to obtain appropriate full inspiratory scans in young children. 2. A significant number of children have clinical characteristics of bronchiectasis but their HRCT scans do not meet the criteria for radiological bronchiectasis (Figure 1 ). HRCT findings of bronchiectasis were derived from adult studies and may not be applicable to children as airways and morphologic changes in the lung occur with maturation and aging. 25, 26 One of the key HRCT signs of bronchiectasis is increased broncho-arterial ratio (defined as the diameter of the bronchial lumen divided by the diameter of its accompanying artery) of > 1-1.5. However this ratio is influenced by age 27 and we argue that a lower bronchoarterial ratio should be used in children to diagnose bronchiectasis. Extrapolation of this line suggests that the cut-off should be at 0.4-0.5 in infancy. Indeed the broncho-arterial ratio in young children (0-5 years) without CSLD symptoms was 0.49 to 0.58. 28 A study based on multi-detector CT chest scans in 41 children (aged < 18 years) without pulmonary symptoms described that broncho-arterial ratio of ! 0.8 should be considered abnormal. 29 3. To fulfil the criteria of 'irreversible dilatation' at least two HRCT scans are required. Performing more than one HRCT scan purely for diagnostic reasons (as opposed to required for management reasons) in some settings is highly impractical and unnecessarily increases cancer risk from CTs in children and adolescents. 30 4. HRCT scans performed in different clinical states, such as during an acute pulmonary exacerbation, immediately following treatment or when clinically stable, may yield different results. While HRCT scans are ideally performed in a 'non-acute state', this is sometimes difficult to define. A 'non-exacerbation state' is not necessarily the same as post-treatment state. Clinicians have realised that this is a significant limitation. The Liverpool group described bronchial dilatation resolving completely in 6 of 21 children with radiologically defined bronchiectasis when HRCT scans were repeated immediately following intensive medical therapy. 31 We and others have observed that radiological 'bronchiectasis' can resolve following appropriate treatment though this is unlikely in more advanced distortion of the conducting airways. Also, Field eluded to this pre-bronchiectatic state back in the 1940's. 32 The above reasons had lead some clinicians, particularly paediatricians, to use the term CSLD. 9,33 Clinically these conditions overlap and the eventual diagnosis is evident only with further investigations and time. While the principles of managing all three conditions are the same, there are few published intervention studies, especially for CSLD. Until further evidence is available, we believe recognising the continuum of a pathogenic process is important given the:",

HRCT of the lower lobes of a child aged 3 years and 7 months during routine investigation for a chronic wet cough that was found to be related to common variable immunodeficiency. The HRCT shows borderline bronchiectasis. Most respiratory paediatricians considered bronchiectasis was present in this HRCT scan but two paediatric radiologists reported absence of abnormal airway dilatation (and thus absence of bronchiectasis). Following treatment (immunoglobulin replacement, intravenous antibiotics and airway clearance), the cough cleared after 2 weeks. Child is currently well (now aged 5.5 years), cough free and has no abnormality spirometry. and places the clinical manifestation in this context. While there is currently no evidence on the detection of biofilm in the airways (other than for CF and diffuse panbronchiolitis), 38 it is however likely important in the pathophysiology of chronic lower airway infections and contributes to the difficulty in eradicating infection once established. In the mucosa of ears (which is arguably relevant to lower airways), the importance of biofilms in chronic otitis media has been described. 39 In this paradigm, bronchiectasis is viewed as a radiological or pathological sign resulting from a long standing process in the same way that a myocardial infarction is an event in some patients with ischemic heart disease. As with ischaemic heart disease the paradigm of persistent bacterial bronchitis is a description of a process which can have a clinical expression from asymptomatic, minimal symptoms to life threatening severe impairment of function or premature death. 40 Moreover with appropriate intervention progression can be arrested or even reversed. 34, 41 Precursors of bronchiectasis and lung function abnormality Aetiological associations and risk factors for bronchiectasis are discussed by Kapur and Karadag in this series. 42 PBB and CSLD as precursors were briefly discussed above and in other publications. 9,10,43 Other potential precursors of airway dysfunction, CSLD and bronchiectasis are further briefly discussed below.",

Reviews on the biology of persistent airway neutrophilia and its potential damaging effects are available elsewhere. 50, 51 In recent years, large epidemiological data from the COPD literature have shown that in addition to tobacco smoking, the antecedence of these chronic respiratory diseases occurs in childhood. 5, 45 While bronchiectasis is not COPD, both diseases share some common features when advanced (chronic productive cough, fixed airflow limitation). Two studies 52,53 have also described the high prevalence (29-50%) of bronchiectasis in adults with COPD. Whether or not these adults had bronchiectasis before being labelled as having COPD is unknown ie the temporal relationship between the two diseases is unknown. Similarly there is a substantial overlap between bronchiectasis with asthma 11 and COPD. 54 In bronchiectasis-specific literature, recurrent hospitalisations for respiratory infections and prematurity have been shown to be independent significant risk factors for the later development of bronchiectasis in children. 55 As it would appear that childhood respiratory disease and risk factors are relevant for the development of adult respiratory disease, epidemiological studies documenting this relationship are reviewed below.",

From the same cohort, Svanes et al 5 reported that early life disadvantage (maternal and paternal asthma, severe respiratory infections before aged 5-years, maternal smoking) were significantly associated with adult development of COPD. Longitudinal data from the Newcastle Thousand Families cohort likewise described that childhood respiratory infections contributed significantly to future adult lung function. 56 Other important factors from this study 56 were birth weight, breast feeding (for >4 weeks), asthma and smoking. A study from Scotland 45 described that respiratory disease in early life was associated with a higher risk in adulthood of chronic productive cough, dyspnoea and doctor diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis or emphysema (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.40 to 6.95 for these outcomes). These recent epidemiological studies support older data showing that childhood pneumonia was related to poor lung function in adults with no history of wheeze. 57 While recall bias is always an issue in the design of studies described here, the findings from several large studies are at least consistent and supported by animal work 19 and bronchiectasis-specific literature. 55 Can CSLD and bronchiectasis be prevented?",

Currently lobectomies or pneumonectomies for children with bronchiectasis are rarely appropriate in affluent countries 37 but remain a common and important treatment option in less affluent countries. 58 The fact that the natural history of bronchiectasis and mortality has altered with improvements in health and the environment suggests that with the implementation of other preventative factors, the progression of bronchiectasis could be ameliorated in the majority of children.

Thus, interventions that reduce exacerbations are likely to be important for later adult lung dysfunction. Furthermore, adult data has shown that recurrent exacerbations is one of the strongest predictors of poor QOL. 61 Data on asthma exacerbations in child and adulthood mirrors these findings. O'Byrne and colleagues described that exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or emergency treatment were associated with accelerated lung function (FEV 1 ) decline in subjects not on preventative therapy. 62 It could be argued that children with exacerbations were predestined to have lung function decline anyway, however what evidence there is suggests that children at risk of development of CSLD should receive appropriate therapies 37 to improve immediate symptoms and minimise future lung dysfunction.",

A cohort study 71 and one short term (6-mo) RCT 72 described improvement in lung function and reduction in exacerbation frequency by 50-67% when regular azithromycin was given to adults with bronchiectasis. Whether this reduction is related to azithromycin's anti-microbial effect or the immune-modulatory influences remain to be defined.",

A Brisbane retrospective study found that 34% of exacerbations were preceded by an upper respiratory illness. 4 However, a systematic study utilising modern, sensitive molecular techniques and inclusive of the more recently described viruses (eg human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (HCoV NL63 and HKU1), human bocaviruses and polyomaviruses, rhinovirus C) have not been undertaken.

The clinical manifestations of this bacterial bronchitis are variable being influenced by factors such as age, extent of infection and the degree of damage to the airways. Symptoms may be limited to a cough, typically a moist cough (protracted bacterial bronchitis), while in older children and those with significant damage to the conducting airways (bronchiectasis), expectoration of sputum and more persistent cough occurs. Absent or ineffective treatment regimes lead to progressive damage that can ultimately lead to severe pulmonary impairment.",
