It is caused by over 75 different mutations of the CD40 ligand (CD40L), expressed on activated T-lymphocytes and by other haematopoietic cells,1 whose co-ligand is the CD40 on monocytes and macrophages, B lymphocytes, dentritic cells and endothelial vascular cells. CD40L\u2013CD40 interaction on B cell membranes transduces an essential signal for immunoglobulin class-switching from IgM to IgG, IgA and IgE and for differentiation of B cell memory in response to T cell-dependent antigens. Abnormal interaction between T-lymphocytes and macrophages and epithelial cells causes the defect in T cell functioning. In clinical terms, patients with this syndrome have serious pyogenic infections caused by capsulate bacteria but they are also more prone to infections with intracellular pathogens such as Pneumocystis carinii, Cryptosporidium parvum and Leishmania.",

The first symptoms had appeared 1 month earlier, in the form of a banal viral upper respiratory infection which had struck his 5-year-old brother simultaneously. Unlike his sibling, our patient's condition had progressed to interstitial pneumonitis and had continued to deteriorate, despite aggressive use of antibiotics combined with steroid treatment. The child's previous clinical history was not significant (normal growth, no serious infections, problem-free vaccination with attenuated Sabin vaccine -OPV-, no chronic diarrhoea or cutaneous manifestations) and his family history was negative. Since chest radiography showed a complete opacity of the right lung and marked shadowing of the left lung (Figure 1), the infant was transferred to the intensive care unit where respiratory support was started. The clinical picture worsened with appearance of hypercapnia (pH 7.28, p02 60, pC02 60.9) and onset of full-blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Given the serious situation, with a ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (Pa02/Fi02) of 77 during CPAP indicating an intrapulmonary shunt in excess of 20%, and the poor response to traditional therapy, it was decided to use alveolar surfactant by the endotracheal route, at an initial dose of 100 mg/kg in 3 divided doses daily subsequently reduced to 50 mg/kg/day and then to 30 mg/kg/day. The patient responded with a reduction of Fi02 from 100% to 80% and an increase in Sa02 from 80\u201385% to 90\u201395%. Further therapy involved administration of antibiotics selected according to empirical criteria, given that cultures from bronchial secretion were negative, high-dose steroids (betamethasone 2 mg/kg/day p.o.), fluconazole (10 mg/kg/day i.v.) and alprostadil (10 ng/kg/min).",

Such a choice could only be determined by a careful analysis of risks and benefits, taking into account both the seriousness of the patient's initial clinical picture, that of a life-threatening illness, and the known poor prognosis of the disease. Consent to the procedure was obtained. Six months after the ARDS, BMT was performed following a liver biopsy showing normal histology. The donor was the patient's HLA-identical 5-year-old brother, not affected by the disease. The patient's blood group was O-positive and the donor's was A-positive. The patient was conditioned with busulphan (4 mg/kg in divided doses) from days \u22129 to \u22127, thiotepa (20 mg/kg) on day 6, fludarabine (20 mg/m2) from days \u22125 to \u22123, and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg once daily i.v.) on day \u22122. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine from day \u22122. Infection prophylaxis included administration of ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg). On 14 March 2000, the patient received 3.1 \u00d7 108/kg nucleated bone marrow cells depleted of red blood cells by filtration and centrifugation. On post-transplant day 16, the absolute neutrophil count exceeded 500/\u03bcl for the third consecutive day. Engraftment was confirmed by the change in the recipient's blood type from O-positive to A-positive, and by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA isolated from recipient's peripheral blood cells on day 22. Neither acute nor chronic GVHD occurred, and the clinical course post-transplant was generally uneventful. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged 3 months later.",

PCP is the first clinical sign in 43.2% of cases of XHIM occurring in the first year of life.2 It is therefore advisable to suspect XHIM in all cases of Pneumocystis carinii infection with accompanying hypogammaglobulinemia. Moreover, the case described here might justify extending this indication to include cases of PCP without hypogammaglobulinemia. BAL is the method of choice for identifying the pathogen since sensitivity is higher than testing nasopharyngeal secretions. In a series recently reported,3 the latter method was positive in only one of 10 cases of confirmed PCP. The immunological phenotype of our patient, with normal levels of IgG, a reduction in IgA and without hyper-IgM, differs from initial description of XHIM. Hyper-IgM was present in only half of 56 reported cases of XHIM,2 being a consequence of poorly managed chronic infections, rather than a genetically determined feature of the syndrome. The absence of hyper-IgM found in our patient might therefore be explained by an absence of previous infections. Of greater interest is the absence of hypo-IgG, a feature always present in previous reports.2,4,5,6,7 This was a puzzling finding, and suggests that mechanisms other than the CD40-CD40L interaction are at work which are able to mediate isotopic switching in favour of class G immunoglobulins. Given our patient's age it seems unlikely that his IgG levels were mostly maternal IgG.",

In a study8 investigating a group of infants with XHIM, 70% were infected with this pathogen, and all cases presented with clinically symptomatic associated chronic liver disease. Infection with Cryptosporidium parvum predisposes to sclerosing cholangitis with progression to cirrhosis and liver failure. An association has also been found with various gastrointestinal tumours, including cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma, resulting from dysplastic changes in the biliary epithelium caused by the infection.8 Overall, 75% of patients with XHIM develop liver complications which are the main cause of death,2 and also make successful BMT more difficult to perform. In fact, in patients whose liver function is already seriously affected, a double transplant procedure (liver and bone marrow) may be necessary, using a low-hepatotoxic conditioning regimen. Although there has been a recent report of a successful double transplant,9 the more limited availability of donors and the more complex surgical procedure involved means a significant increase in risk for the patient. Therefore, early diagnosis of the exact form of CID by molecular analysis is extremely important, both for speedy referral for BMT before onset of liver complications, and for giving the specific prophylaxis required before the transplant.",

            "text": "As regards surfactant use, our patient's condition at clinical onset fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ARDS.10 Given the impossibility of maintaining adequate oxygenation despite the use of high-flow oxygen, more aggressive therapy was attempted using alveolar surfactant administered by the endotracheal route. This unconventional and very costly treatment choice was continued after diagnosis of PCP, given the high mortality from infections with this pathogen in infants who are ventilated. A mortality rate of 100% has been reported in such cases.11 The qualitative and quantitative changes in alveolar surfactant of patients with ARDS which occur in the early stages of disease constitutes the physiopathological basis for surfactant therapy. Very few studies, mostly performed on small groups of patients who failed to respond to conventional therapy, have analysed the effectiveness of surfactant in adults or in children with ARDS. A dose-related response, more evident with higher doses (200 mg/kg) than with lower ones (50 mg/kg), was reported in 10/13 children with severe ARDS not responding to conventional ventilation.12 Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether early use of surfactant does improve the prognosis of ARDS, which is still extremely poor, with a case\u2013fatality ratio exceeding 40%. With regard to the choice of a \u2018permanent\u2019 therapy, in our case BMT was an elective procedure, performed when the patient's overall condition was good, with normal results of liver function tests. In the few other reports of boys with XHIM who have hitherto undergone BMT4,5,6,7 the decision was taken for patients whose general condition was much worse, and after a long history of disease-related complications. Pre-operative conditioning did not include radiation therapy so as to avoid the risk of long-term sequelae. Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation may also be effective in XHIM, but its use has so far been restricted to patients who are ineligible for conventional BMT.13 Ciprofloxacin is not routinely used as prophylaxis in the conditioning regimen for infants, but the use of this drug (or that of paromomycin) in prophylaxis and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in patients with XHIM has been advocated by the European Society for Immune Deficiency (ESID). The use of fluoroquinolones in children has been restricted due to the potential cartilage damage that occurred in research with immature animals, but this effect has not been demonstrated in humans.14 Data from over 1700 children in the UK failed to disclose arthropathy and extensive paediatric use of ciprofloxacin in developing countries has been free of articular effects so that restrictions on paediatric use may soon be relaxed.15",
