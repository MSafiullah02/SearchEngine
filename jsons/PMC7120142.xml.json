In most populations to date, pestilence and famine decreased as the result of advances in sanitation, medicine, and nutrition. Increases in life expectancy paralleled socioeconomic development and technological changes, and pandemics were replaced with chronic degenerative disorders. Of course, different populations progress through such epidemiologic transitions at different rates and in different times. To use the United States of America as an example, rapid development throughout the agricultural and industrial revolutions followed by advances in science and public health drove the US Surgeon General William H. Stewart to reportedly tell the Congress in 1969 that it was \u201ctime to close the book on infectious diseases, declare the war against pestilence won, and shift national resources to such chronic problems as cancer and heart disease.\u201d He did not foresee the massive impact that emerging and reemerging infectious diseases would have on human health and economic prosperity worldwide.",

            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are those that have recently increased in incidence (number of new cases in a given period of time), expanded in geographic range, moved into a new host population, or are caused by newly evolved or discovered pathogens (Lederberg et al. 1992; Morens et al. 2004; Weiss and McMichael 2004). Examples include dengue hemorrhagic fever, West Nile virus, and H5N1 avian influenza. The primary causes of EIDs in human populations have been the anthropogenic modifications of physical and social environments (Cohen 2000; Daily and Ehrlich 1996; McMichael 2004; Morens et al. 2004; Patz et al. 2000, 2004; Weiss and McMichael 2004). Human and livestock populations continue to grow rapidly, increasing the number of hosts potentially susceptible to novel infections. Mass transportation of people, products, livestock, and vectors of disease brings each of these closer to one another, and more quickly (Kimball et al. 2005; Wilson 2003). Population movements due to war, social disruption, and rural-to-urban migration, in addition to general urbanization, increase the densities of nonimmune human hosts and pose significant sanitation problems. Natural disasters and bioterrorism may destroy public health infrastructure and other resources (Watson et al. 2007). Changes in water usage, such as during the construction of dams, culverts, and irrigation systems, can increase the potential breeding sites of vector species like mosquitoes and snails (Keiser et al. 2005; Steinmann et al. 2006). Sex tourism, intravenous drug abuse, reuse of injectable medical equipment, and improper disinfection or ineffective protective measures in hospitals all contribute to the rapid evolution of resistant and deadly pathogens. The misgovernance of epidemics with decentralized testing, misdiagnoses, and underreporting of cases has resulted in slow public health responses to several pandemics (Cyranoski 2005; Normile 2005). Interactions between human and wildlife populations have also been a source of EIDs.",

Population, ecological, and behavioral changes that increase contact with wildlife exacerbate emergence of these pathogens (Daszak et al. 2000). Human encroachment into previously undisturbed areas increases remote area accessibility and introduces more vectors and reservoirs of infection to new hosts. Encroachment, extensification of agricultural land, and urban sprawl all alter population densities and distributions of wildlife, which change disease dynamics (Patz et al. 2004).

Squirrels and other \u201cdilution hosts\u201d can protect areas from Lyme disease (ibid.). With more hosts in general, and less competent hosts (those that do not support optimal growth and transmission of the pathogen) in particular, Ixodes ticks are less likely to feed on humans and successfully transmit Lyme disease. Predatory vertebrates also help protect humans from Lyme disease and many other infections by keeping the abundance of rodent hosts at bay (Ostfeld and Holt 2004).",

Similarly, increased small-mammal diversity protects sympatric rodent populations from the spread of Hantavirus infection (Suz\u00e1n et al. 2009). Such protection represents a largely overlooked ecosystem service. Twenty-five percent (25%) of all extant mammals are now endangered, and approximately 30% of these will become extinct by the year 2050 (Schipper et al. 2008).

            "text": "Bushmeat hunting, preparation, and consumption are linked with several pandemics and epidemics, most notably human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The current HIV pandemic, with an estimated global prevalence of 33 million people (UNAIDS 2008), appears to have originated from nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV). Through the hunting and butchering of nonhuman primates (resulting in cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure) in West Africa, SIV likely entered into the human population several times and became established as HIV around 1900 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (Worobey et al. 2008). Based on overwhelming genetic similarities (genome structure and protein homology), HIV-1 groups M and N likely originated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Cameroon, group O from western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon, and HIV-2 from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Apetrei et al. 2005; Bailes et al. 2003; Gao et al. 1999; Hahn et al. 2000; Keele et al. 2006; Peeters et al. 2002; Santiago et al. 2005; Van Heuverswyn et al. 2006). Direct exposure to nonhuman primate blood through hunting and butchering is common in several populations in West Africa (Wolfe et al. 2004), and SIV has been identified in nonhuman primate bushmeat, pet animals, and bushmeat hunters in West Africa (Apetrei et al. 2005; Kalish et al. 2005; Peeters et al. 2002).",

The virus appears to be restricted to the rainforests of central and western Africa and Southeast Asia (Monath 1999; Peterson et al. 2004). Marburg, a related virus, appears to be restricted to dry, open areas of central and eastern Africa, and the distributions of Ebola and Marburg likely reflect natural host distribution (ibid.). Nearly all cases of Ebola in humans can be traced back to the handling or consumption of infected wildlife carcasses, particularly that of apes (Leroy et al. 2004; Pourrut et al. 2005). Although not definitively known at this time, several fruit bat species are suspected to be the natural reservoir host for Ebola (subtype Zaire) and possibly other subtypes (Biek et al. 2006; Leroy et al. 2005).",

SARS is a coronavirus (Drosten et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) that produced a human epidemic between 2002 and 2004, claiming almost 775 lives (Hughes 2004). The epidemic originated in the Foshan Municipality of the Guangdong Province of China, with the earliest infections confirmed in animal traders (Yu et al. 2003). Several species of animals in the wet market tested positive for SARS, including Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procuyoinboides), and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) (Guan et al. 2003). Horseshoe bats were likely fed to farmed civets or came into contact with civet farms, and these infected civets were later sold in wet markets, introducing SARS into the general human population. The main February 2003 outbreak can be traced to a single individual who stayed at a hotel in Hong Kong where the pathogen was then spread via aerosolization to ten hotel guests who then traveled to seven different countries, subsequently spreading the pathogen to many individuals, including hundreds of healthcare workers (Hughes 2004). Fear of decreased tourism, travel, and trade was the primary reason for Chinese government officials\u2019 underreporting the actual number of casualties, delayed reporting to the World Health Organization, and initial noncooperation with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Barry 2004; Bloom 2003; Heymann 2004; Kahn 2003; Parry 2003).",

Vector-borne and waterborne EIDs have been linked in complex ways with climate change (Epstein 2001; Patz et al. 2008). Examples include outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwest United States (Engelthaler et al. 1999), West Nile virus in the United States (Epstein 2001), Rift Valley fever in Kenya (Linthicum et al. 1999), and cholera in Bangladesh (Colwell 1996). Degradation and fragmentation of habitats also forces the overlap of wildlife, domestic animal, and human ecologies. In fact, an important, but often overlooked externality of land-use/land-cover change is the spread of infection. Examples of EIDs linked with climate and land-use/land-cover changes include Nipah virus, Lyme disease, Chikungunya virus, and malaria.",

            "text": "Nipah virus is a single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae that causes severe acute febrile encephalitis in humans. Like SARS and many other viruses (Calisher et al. 2006; Halpin et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2007), bats (flying fox, genus Pteropus) are the natural reservoir of Nipah virus. Nipah virus resulted in over 100 human fatalities in the Kinta district of northern peninsular Malaysia in 1998\u20131999. The cause of the outbreak is now attributed to a complex interaction of human-induced environmental changes. Fire-mediated deforestation for the expansion of oil palm plantations produced significant respirable suspended-particulate matter in the region. Combined with a drought produced by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, the availability of flowering and fruiting forest trees was reduced (Chua et al. 2002). Malayan flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus) and island flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) began feeding in durian (Durio zibethinus) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) orchards planted near pig farms. Bat urine as well as partially eaten fruit entered the pigsties, and the virus amplified within the swine. Despite producing severe respiratory disease, the infected pigs were distributed throughout Malaysia. Transmission between bats, pigs, and humans probably happened several times, beginning even before the El Ni\u00f1o event of 1998. It may also have simply been the case that a rapidly expanding pig population increased the probability of contact between bats and pig farms, or that bats were forced to feed in these human orchards because of hunting in other areas (Field 2009). Habitat loss and climate change may also have facilitated viral transmission via nutritional stress, which alters bat physiology, increasing viral seroprevalence and persistence in these animals, increasing the likelihood of horizontal transmission between the flying foxes, and possibly direct transmission between flying foxes and humans (Plowright et al. 2008). Subsequent human outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, with transmission largely attributed to Pteropus giganteus (Epstein et al. 2006).",

Suitable habitat for various tick species is expected to increase dramatically in North America and Europe with global warming (Brownstein et al. 2005; Lindgren et al. 2000; Ogden et al. 2005). Already the Aedes aegypti mosquito has expanded its geographic range in response to increased global temperatures, resulting in increased risk of Dengue virus in subtropical and temperate climates (Hales et al. 2002). Similarly, the outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States in the early 1990s was linked to heavy summer rains associated with the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation effect and the subsequent proliferation of pine nuts and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), the natural reservoir of the Hantaan virus (family Bunyaviridae) (Engelthaler et al. 1999).",

            "text": "Land-use and climate changes are associated in complicated ways with altered rates of malaria incidence. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium (phylum Apicomplexa, order Haemosporidia, family Plasmodiidae), with 172 named species that parasitize reptiles, birds, and mammals (Coatney et al. 1971; Garnham 1966; Levine 1988). Of these, only 4 usually infect humans (P. falciparum, vivax, ovale, and malariae), 19 infect nonhuman primates, and 19 infect various other mammals. The parasites are transmitted by over 50 species of female Anopheles mosquitoes (Kiszewski et al. 2004). Members of the genus Plasmodium likely diverged from the order Haemosporidia around 500 million years ago, perhaps around the time of the Cambrian explosion (Escalante and Ayala 1994). Worldwide climatic changes throughout the last glaciation and the advent of agriculture would have facilitated the spread of the Anopheles vector (Coluzzi 1999). During the agrarian revolution, higher-density, sedentary human populations provided mosquitoes with necessary bloodmeals and potential breeding sites (Hartl 2004; Livingstone 1958). Malaria is now endemic in most tropical regions of the world (Guerra et al. 2008). The global incidence of human malaria is estimated to be more than 300 million new clinical cases each year (Trigg and Kondrachine 1998; WHO 1999). The economic and social impacts of this disease are enormous (Gallup and Sachs 2001).",

The combined effects include more mosquitoes with shortened parasite development time (Afrane et al. 2005, 2006) and increased vectorial capacity (number of infective bites a host receives in a given time period) (Afrane et al. 2008; Vittor et al. 2006). Cultivated areas with elevated water temperatures are also characterized by higher mosquito production rates and increased malaria transmission risk compared to undisturbed areas (Lindblade et al. 2000; Munga et al. 2006). Further shifting of geographic and temporal patterns of incidence of malaria is expected in response to continued climate change (Bhattacharya et al. 2006). This will likely include increased duration of transmission windows, increased mosquito abundance (Pascual et al. 2006), and increased altitudinal distribution of mosquitoes (Ebi et al. 2005; Martens et al. 1995).",

Zoonotic malaria has probably infected humans for thousands of years, but not until recently has Plasmodium knowlesi become recognized as a potential major cause of human morbidity and mortality. Plasmodium knowlesi commonly infects long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis) and pig-tailed (Macaca nemestrina) macaques and is typically transmitted by forest-dwelling Anopheles hackeri and Anopheles latens in Sarawak, Malaysia, and Anopheles cracens in peninsular Malaysia (Vythilingam et al. 2008), and other Anopheles mosquitoes of the leucosphyrus group in other countries (Galinski and Barnwell 2009). Many cases of fatal malaria once attributed to P. malariae were only recently recognized to have been caused by P. knowlesi (Jongwutiwes et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2004). Encroachment into forested areas will likely facilitate continued host switching of malarial parasites (Cox-Singh and Singh 2008). Conflict and natural disasters combined with normal rural-to-urban migration will result in population movements that increase the likelihood of malaria transmission (Martens and Hall 2000).",

Ecotourism accounts for a significant proportion of all international tourism and contributes billions of dollars to the national income of various countries (Filion et al. 1994). Such revenue can enhance economic opportunities for local residents, support environmental education, and protect the natural and cultural heritage of the area, including the conservation of biodiversity and improvement of local facilities. Wildlife is certainly more valuable alive than dead (Thresher 1981). Unfortunately, rapid, unmonitored development of ecotourism projects can lead to degradation of habitats and deleterious effects on animal well-being (Kuss et al. 1990; Speight 1973). Habituation of animals to human presence can increase the likelihood that animals will actively seek out contact with humans, particularly in the form of crop raiding and invasion of garbage pits and latrines. Habituation also makes wildlife more vulnerable to poaching because of their loss of fear of humans. Other risks associated with ecotourism in protected areas include habitat degradation, pollution, crowding, introduction of invasive species, increased tax burdens for local communities, inappropriate development of infrastructure, and disruption of community activities, particularly when communities do not have adequate control over their involvement in tourism.",

This is particularly the case for primates that are genetically closely related to humans (and thus share susceptibility to many common pathogens) and are threatened by habitat destruction, exploitation and fragmentation, hunting and bushmeat consumption, illegal pet trade, and infectious diseases. Transmission of infections between human and nonhuman primate populations is exacerbated by expansion of local communities, refugee populations, park personnel, researchers, filmmakers and photographers, and tourists. This is despite the fact that primate ecotourism is increasingly perceived as a venue for promoting awareness about conservation issues.

These animals are usually immunologically na\u00efve to our pathogens, and ape populations can be quickly decimated because of their slow reproductive rates.

Of 633 individuals surveyed in 2007, over half reported being currently vaccinated against tuberculosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, and measles. Fewer participants reported current vaccination status for influenza, rabies, and chicken pox. Despite the fact that the majority of visitors to Sepilok are from temperate regions where influenza is relatively more prevalent, 67.1% of those surveyed with medical-related occupations reported not being currently vaccinated for influenza (Muehlenbein et al. 2008). Respiratory infections, like influenza, would arguably be the easiest to transmit while visiting these primates (primarily orangutan and macaques) at Sepilok. Visitors to other wildlife sanctuaries are likely undervaccinated as well.",

Of the sample of tourists, 10.8% self-reported at least one symptom associated with respiratory tract infection (cough, sore throat, or congestion). The participants with recent animal contact (e.g., livestock, wildlife at other sanctuaries, unfamiliar domestic pets) were more likely to report current respiratory symptoms compared to individuals with no such animal contact. Similarly, participants with a medical-related occupation were more likely to report current respiratory symptoms while at Sepilok compared to participants with nonmedical occupations. That is, currently ill and potentially infectious tourists were still visiting a wildlife sanctuary to view endangered species, despite having at least some basic knowledge about infection transmission (i.e., medical-related occupation), or having had animal contact immediately prior to arriving. While participants in nature-based tourism are generally concerned about environmental protection, analyses suggest that a significant proportion of ecotourists are either uninformed of the risks they may pose to nonhuman animal health or chose to ignore such risks.

Tourist ignorance over infection risks, particularly the risks they pose to the very same wildlife they are interested in protecting, cannot be justified, regardless of the large sums of money people spend to visit these exotic destinations. It is therefore the combined responsibility of the tourism and medical communities to more accurately communicate the risks of zoonotic and anthropozoonotic infections in ways that best support the needs of humans and wildlife alike. The global management of zoonotic and anthropozoonotic epidemics is an obligation that transcends any one discipline. Unregulated ecotourism, climate and land-use/land-cover changes, and bushmeat consumption can all exacerbate human-wildlife contact and the subsequent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. Yet arguably these human-wildlife interactions are manageable to some degree, given the right resolve and resources. Responsible health monitoring of human-wildlife interactions is a necessary prerequisite for prevention of future emerging infectious diseases.",
