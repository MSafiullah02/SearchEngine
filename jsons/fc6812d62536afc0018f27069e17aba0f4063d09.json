Here, by manually curating a 22 high-quality database of 268 pairs of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction, 23 which included 128 unique viral species or sub-species and 119 virus receptors, we 24 found the viral receptors were structurally and functionally diverse, yet they had 25 several common features when compared to other cell membrane proteins: more 26 protein domains, higher level of N-glycosylation, higher ratio of self-interaction and 27 more interaction partners, and higher expression in most tissues of the host. 28 Additionally, the receptors used by the same virus tended to co-evolve. Further 29 correlation analysis between viral receptors and the tissue and host specificity of the 30 virus shows that the virus receptor similarity was a significant predictor for 31 mammalian virus cross-species. This work could deepen our understanding towards 32 the viral receptor selection and help evaluate the risk of viral zoonotic diseases. 33 ",

            "text": "systematic analysis of the characteristics of the viral receptor could help understand 63 the mechanisms under the receptor selection by viruses. 64 The virus-receptor interaction was reported to be a principal determinant of viral host 65 range, tissue tropism and cross-species infection [11, 16, 22] . The existence and 66 expression of the virus receptor in a host (or tissue) should be a prerequisite for viral 67 infection of the host (or tissue) [21] . Usually, a virus mainly infects some particular 68 type of hosts or tissues. For example, the influenza virus mostly infects cells of the 69 respiratory tract [23] . However, the virus-receptor interaction is a highly dynamic 70 process. Some viruses can recognize one or more receptors [13, 14, 24] , which can also 71 differ among virus variants or during the course of infections [14, 25, 26] . In some cases, 72 a few amino acid mutations in the viral protein or the receptor could abolish or 73 enhance viral infection [27] [28] [29] . Besides, the virus-receptor interaction is under 143 We firstly investigated the structural characteristics of mammalian virus receptor 144 proteins. As expected, all the mammalian virus receptor protein belonged to the 145 membrane protein which had at least one transmembrane alpha helix ( Figure S2A ). 146 Twenty-four of them had more than five helixes, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine 147 receptor 2A (HTR2A) and NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1). The 148 receptor protein was mainly located in the cell membrane. Besides, more than one 149 third (43/119) of them were also located in the cytoplasm, and thirteen of them were 150 located in the nucleus. 151 Then, the protein domain composition of the mammalian virus receptor protein was analyzed. The mammalian virus receptor proteins contained a total of 336 domains 153 based on the Pfam database, with each viral receptor protein containing more than two 154 domains on average ( Figure S2B ). This was significantly more than that of human 155 proteins or human membrane proteins (p-values < 0.001 in the Wilcoxon rank-sum 156 test). Some viral receptor proteins may contain more than 10 domains, such as 157 complement C3d receptor 2 (CR2) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The human viral receptors were observed to have ten or more N-glycosylation sites, such 171 as complement C3b/C4b receptor 1 (CR1) and lysosomal associated membrane 172 protein 1 (LAMP1). Figure 2B displayed the modeled 3D-structure of HTR2A, the 173 receptor for JC polyomavirus (JCPyV). Five N-glycosylation sites were highlighted in red on the structure, which were reported to be important for viral infection [30] . For 175 comparison, we also characterized the N-glycosylation level for the human cell 176 membrane protein, human membrane proteins and all human proteins (Figure 2A ). It 177 was found they had a significantly lower level of N-glycosylation than that of human 178 and mammalian virus receptors (p-values < 0.001 in the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), 179 which suggests the importance of N-glycosylation for the viral receptor.

            "text": "Since the viral receptor determines the host specificity of the virus to a large extent, it 343 is expected that the closer between the viral receptor and its homolog in a species, the 344 more likely the virus which used the receptor would infect the species. To validate this 345 hypothesis, we firstly calculated the sequence identities between the viral receptor and 346 their homologs in 108 mammal species ( Figure 5 and Table S6 ). For clarity, only 26 347 mammal species, which were frequently observed, were presented in Figure 5 . Then, Table S6 . what's the relationship between glycosylation and viral receptor selection? As we know, glycosylation of proteins is widely observed in eukaryote cells [32] . It plays an 401 important role in multiple cellular activities, such as folding and stability of 402 glycoprotein, immune response, cell-cell adhesion, and so on. Glycans are abundant 403 on host cell surfaces. They were probably the primordial and fallback receptors for the 404 virus [11] . To use glycans as their receptors, a large number of viruses have stolen a 405 host galectin and employed it as a viral lectin [11, 33] . For example, the SJR fold, which 406 was mainly responsible for glycan recognition and binding in cellular proteins, was 407 observed in viral capsid proteins of over one fourth of viruses [33] . Thus, during the 408 process of searching for protein receptors, the protein with high level of glycosylation 409 could provide a basal attachment ability for the virus, and should be the preferred 410 receptor for the virus. 411 Secondly, our analysis showed that the viral receptor protein had a tendency to 412 interact with itself and had far more interaction partners than other membrane proteins. 413 Besides the function of viral receptor, the receptor protein functions in the host cell by 414 interacting with other proteins of the host, such as signal molecules and ligands. 415 Therefore, the virus has to compete with these proteins for binding to the receptor [15] . 416 The protein with less interaction partners are expected to be preferred by the virus. 417 Why did the virus select the proteins with multiple interaction partners as receptors? 418 One possible reason is that the receptor proteins are closely related to the \"door\" of 419 the cell, so that many proteins have to interact with them for in-and-out of the cell. 420 This could be partly validated by the observation that for the interaction partners of 421 human viral receptors, six of top ten enriched terms in the domain of GO Biological Process were related to protein targeting or localization (Table S3) . For entry into the 423 cell, the virus also selects these proteins as receptors. Another possible reason is that 424 viral entry into the cell needs cooperation of multiple proteins which were not 425 identified as viral receptors yet. Besides, previous studies show that the virus could 426 structurally mimic native host ligands [34] , which help them bind to the host receptor. (Table   485   S1 ).",

            "text": "The number of transmembrane alpha helix of the mammalian virus receptor was 488 derived from the database of UniprotKB and the web server TMpred [46] . The location 489 for the viral receptor was inferred from the description of \"Subcellular location\" for 490 the receptor protein provided by UniProtKB, or from the GO annotations for them: 491 the viral receptors annotated with GO terms which included the words of \"cell surface\" 492 or \"plasma membrane\" were considered to be located in the cell membrane; those 493 annotated with GO terms which included the words of \"cytoplasm\", \"cytosol\" or 494 \"cytoplasmic vesicle\", or shown to be in the cytoplasm in UniProtKB, were 495 considered to be located in the cytoplasm; those annotated with GO terms \"nucleus\" 496 (GO:0005634) or \"nucleoplasm\" (GO:0005654) were considered to be located in the [49] in R (version 3.4.2) [50] . To identify the homolog of the mammalian virus receptor in other mammal species, 528 the protein sequence of each viral receptor was searched against the database of mammalian protein sequences, which were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq database 530 [54] on October 10 th , 2017, with the help of BLAST (version 2.6.0) [55] . Analysis 531 showed that in the database of mammalian protein sequences, there were 108 532 mammal species which were richly annotated and had far more protein sequences 533 than other mammal species (Table S7) . Therefore, only these 108 mammal species 534 were considered in the evolutionary analysis. Based on the results of BLAST, the 535 homolog for the viral receptor was defined as the hit with E-value small than 1E-10, 536 coverage equal to or greater than 80% and sequence identity equal to or greater than 537 30%. Only the closest homolog, i.e., the best hit, in each mammal species was used (Table S4 ). Similar methods 544 as above were utilized to calculate the indicators of conservation level for these 545 proteins. 546 For analysis of co-evolution between viral receptors, firstly for each viral receptor, a 547 phylogenetic tree was built based on the protein sequences of the receptor and its 548 homologs in 108 mammal species with the help of phylip (version 3.68) [56] . The 549 neighbor-joining method was used with the default parameter. Then, the genetic 550 distances between the viral receptor and their homologs were extracted from the phylogenetic tree with a perl script. Finally, for a pair of viral receptors, the spearman 552 correlation coefficient (SCC) was calculated between the pairwise genetic distances of 553 viral receptors and their homologs, which was used to measure the extent of 554 co-evolution between this pair of viral receptors. 555 The set of housekeeping gene in human was adapted from the work of Eisenberg et al 556 [57] . A total of 3804 genes were identified as the housekeeping gene. (Table S5) The mammalian virus-host interactions were primarily adapted from Olival's work [7] . 571 One hundred and fifteen viruses in our database and 61 of 108 richly annotated mammal species could be mapped to those in Olival's work (Table S8 ). These 115 573 viruses used a total of 116 viral receptors. The sequence identities of these viral 574 receptor proteins to their related homologs in the corresponding mammal species were 575 presented in Table S6 . 576 For comparison, we also extracted genetic distances (host relatedness) between the 577 mammal species and the viral host with reported receptors based on Olival's work 578 (Table S9) . Then, the genetic distance of the mammal species to the viral host with 579 reported receptors, and the sequence identity of the receptor homolog in the mammal 580 species to the viral receptor protein, was respectively used to predict whether a 581 mammal species could be infected by the virus which infected the host with reported 582 receptors. The method of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 583 evaluate and compare their performance with the functions of roc(), auc(), roc.test() 584 and plot.roc() in the package of \"pROC\" [59] in R (version 3.2.5). 585 Statistical analysis 586 All the statistical analysis was conducted in R (version 3.2.5) [50] . The wilcoxon 587 rank-sum test was conducted with the function of wilcox.test(). ",

We found that 93 of 119 mammalian virus receptors 167 were N-glycosylated with an average of 0.94 glycosylation sites per 100 amino acids 168 (Figure 2A). It increased to 0.97 glycosylation sites per 100 amino acids for the 169 human viral receptor (Figure 2A), among which 62 were N-glycosylated. Twelve170",

The degree and betweenness of each protein 226 in the PPIN were calculated, which could measure the importance of a protein in the 227 PPIN. It was found that the degrees for human membrane proteins and cell membrane 228 proteins were significantly smaller than those of other human proteins (Figure 2C & S3A, p-value < 0.001 in Wilcox rank-sum test) in the PPIN. Similar observations could be found for the node betweenness in the PPIN (Figure S3B&C). 231 However, the human virus receptor protein, a subset of the human cell membrane 232 protein, was found to have significantly larger degrees and higher betweenness than 233 other human proteins in the PPIN (Figure 2C and Figure S3, p-value < 0.001 in 234 Wilcox rank-sum test).

This ratio (0.15 = 11/74) was a little lower than that of 256 housekeeping genes in all human genes (0.19 = 3804/20243), suggesting that the 257 human viral receptor was not enriched in the housekeeping gene. 258 Then, we investigated the evolutionary conservation of mammalian virus receptors in 259 108 mammal species which were richly annotated in the NCBI Reference Sequences 260 (RefSeq) database (see Methods). Over half of mammalian virus receptors had 261 homologs (see Methods) in more than 100 mammal species (Figure S4A).

However, the human viral receptor (in red), which was 278 part of the human cell membrane gene, expressed much higher than other sets of 279 genes in nearly all these tissues.

The black arrow refers to the average expression level of genes in receptors used by the same virus tended to co-evolve 291 The results mentioned above shows that a total of 51 viruses used more than one viral 292 receptor. These viral receptors may work together or independently. We then analyzed 293 the relationship between them. Structural analysis shows that except for integrins 294 which generally work in heterodimer, few of viral receptors used by the same virus 295 shared the same protein domain (data not shown). This suggests that when the virus 296 expands the use of receptors, it tends to select structurally diverse proteins. We 297 continued to analyze the co-evolution between mammalian viral receptors in 108 298 mammal species. We found that the average of Spearman Correlation Coefficients 299 (SCCs, a measure of the extent of co-evolution) between viral receptors employed by 300 the same virus was 0.54, which was significantly larger than that between other viral 301 receptors (Figure 4A, p-value < 0.001 in the Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

Besides, few studies quantify such associations. Therefore, 322 we further investigated systematically the association between the tissue and host 323 specificity of the virus and the viral receptor. 324 1) Viral receptor expressed higher in tissues infected by viruses than in those not 325 infected 326 To investigate the association between the tissue specificity of the virus and 327 tissue-specific expression of viral receptors, we manually compiled the tissue tropism 328 of viruses from the literature or Wikipedia and obtained that in 32 human tissues for a 329 total of 52 viruses (Table S5). Some viral receptors had high expression levels in most 330 tissues, most of which were housekeeping genes, such as CD81 molecule (CD81) and 331 ITGB1. While for most viral receptors, their expression levels varied much in 332 different tissues. Analysis of the association between the tissue-specific expression of 333 viral receptors and viral tissue tropism showed that the viral receptor expressed higher 334 in the tissues infected by viruses (marked with asterisks inTable S5) than in those not335    infected, yet this difference was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.1 in the 336 Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Figure S5). For example, the neural cell adhesion molecule 337 1 (NCAM1), which was employed by the Rabies lyssavirus (RabiesV) as the receptor, 338 expressed much higher in the tissue of Cerebral cortex (infected by RabiesV) than in 339 other tissues not infected by the virus",

We 355 compared the ability of the host relatedness and the viral receptor similarity in 356 predicting viral cross-species in mammal species. The models based on the latter 357 achieved an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.65 (Figure 6B), a little higher 358 than that of the model based on the former (0.62), although this difference was not 359 statistically significant (p-value = 0.13).

This may be directly related to the 431 above finding that the viral receptor generally had multiple interaction partners: on the 432 one hand, the viral receptor needs multiple copies to interact with multiple proteins; 433 on the other hand, since the virus has to compete with other proteins for binding to the 434 receptor, high expression of the receptor will facilitate the virus's binding to the -receptor interaction is a major determinant of viral host range and tissue 437 tropism. Previous case studies showed that the viral receptor expressed highly in the 438 tissues infected by the virus[35, 36]  . Consistent with these studies, our systematic 439 analysis found that the tissues with high expression of the viral receptor, and the 440 mammal species with homologs highly similar to the viral receptor, were more 441 possibly to be infected by the virus. However, the opposites were also observed. Some442 mammal species (or tissues) which had no receptor homolog (or low expression of the 443 viral receptor) were also infected by the virus. These viruses may use other receptors not identified yet. Some mammal species (or tissues) with homologs highly similar to 445 viral receptors (or high expression of the viral receptor) were observed to be not 446 infected by the virus. This may be partly explained by the missed virus-host 447 interactions in our data. Besides, it may also suggest that the host or tissue 448 susceptibility to the virus is not solely determined by the viral receptor. More factors 449 such as the host or tissue accessibility [7, 23] , the cell defense system [some limitations within the study. Firstly, the viral receptor was biased 453 towards the human, due to the bias of studies towards human viruses. Fortunately, the 454 viral receptor was conserved in mammal species to a large extent, which may reduce 455 the influence of this bias on the diversity of viral receptors. Secondly, the virus-host 456 interactions were not complete due to limited surveys [7] . According to the risk 457 analysis of viral cross-species based on viral receptors, much more mammal species 458 may be infected by the mammalian virus analyzed in this study. High attention should 459 be paid to this risk. Thirdly, due to the difficulties of identifying viral receptors [17, 41, characteristics identified here should not only deepen our understanding of the viral 467 receptor selection, but also help for development of more effective methods for 468 identifying viral receptors. Besides, evaluating the risk of viral cross-species infection 469 based on the viral receptor could also help for early warning and prediction of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction 474 The data of mammalian virus-host receptor interaction were compiled from three 475 sources: firstly, the literature related to viral receptors (a total of 1303 papers) were 476 downloaded from NCBI Pubmed database [43] by searching \"virus receptor\" [TIAB] or 477 \"viral receptor\"[TIAB] on August 14 th , 2017.
