            "text": "Phenobarbital is the drug of choice for control of canine epilepsy. Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzyme activity, can be hepatotoxic, and decreases serum thyroxine (T 4 ) concentrations in some dogs. The duration of liver enzyme induction and T 4 concentration decreases after discontinuation of phenobarbital is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in serum total T 4 (TT 4 ), free T 4 (FT 4 ), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cholesterol and albumin concentrations, and activities in serum of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) after discontinuation of long-term phenobarbital administration in normal dogs. Twelve normal dogs were administered phenobarbital at a dosage of approximately 4.4-6.6 mg/kg PO q12h for 27 weeks. Blood was collected for analysis before and after 27 weeks of phenobarbital administration and then weekly for 10 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. The dogs were clinically normal throughout the study period. Serum ALT and ALP activity and TSH and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher than baseline at week 27. Serum T 4 and FT 4 were significantly lower. Serum albumin and GGT were not changed from baseline at week 27. Changes in estimate of thyroid function (TT 4 , FT 4 , TSH) persisted for 1-4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital, whereas changes in hepatic enzyme activity (ALT, ALP) and cholesterol concentration resolved in 3-5 weeks. To avoid false positive results, it is recommended that thyroid testing be performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital administration. Elevated serum activity of hepatic enzymes 6-8 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital may indicate hepatic disease.",

[1] [2] [3] Phenobarbital is an effective anticonvulsant in 60-80% of dogs if a serum concentration of 15-40 g/mL is maintained. 4 Potential adverse effects of phenobarbital administration include sedation, polyphagia, polyuria and polydipsia, and teratogenicity. 1, 4 One report of 3 dogs documented neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with long-term administration of phenobarbital. 5 In addition, phenobarbital is hepatotoxic in some dogs. [6] [7] [8] Phenobarbital is a potent inducer of cytochrome p450 and hepatic microsomal enzymes in dogs, with subsequent increases in serum activity of these enzymes making it difficult to detect hepatotoxicosis. 1, 3, 4 When enzyme induction resolves after withdrawal of phenobarbital is unknown, which confounds such determinations further.",

Pretreatment evaluation had included physical examination, a full chemistry panel 4 weeks before and immediately before phenobarbital initiation, complete blood count, and urinalysis.

Potential reasons include lack of seizure activity for an extended period, the desire to switch to a potentially less toxic anticonvulsant such as potassium bromide, or toxicity related to phenobarbital administration. 1 Hepatotoxicosis is a limiting factor to the use of phenobarbital as an anticonvulsant in some dogs. 1, 3, 6, 7, [17] [18] [19] However, determining if increases in serum activity of liver specific enzymes in a dog presenting for nonspecific clinical signs are due to hepatotoxicosis or because of a drug-induced enzyme induction can be difficult. When hepatotoxicosis is suspected, it is recommended that phenobarbital be discontinued and that the anticonvulsant treatment regimen be changed if possible.",

Examination of liver biopsies of 3 dogs revealed hepatic fibrosis and nodular regeneration. Reduction of the phenobarbital dose or discontinuation of the drug resulted in clinical improvement in 60% of dogs. Serum phenobarbital concentrations did not decrease for several days, but the changes in hepatic enzyme activity in serum after phenobarbital reduction or discontinuation were not reported. 18 The present study has clinical relevance in that activity of hepatic enzymes in serum that is still significantly abnormal at least 6 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital should lead the clinician to reevaluate the dog for hepatotoxicosis or other liver disease. In the dogs of this study, changes in serum activity of hepatic enzymes (ALT, ALP, GGT) and cholesterol concentration resolved 1-5 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Based on these findings, it can be recommended that serum ALP, ALT, GGT, and cholesterol be reevaluated at least 6 weeks after discontinuing drug therapy.",

Therefore, the ALP elevations likely were attributable to phenobarbital-induced enzyme changes. 12 In dogs treated with glucocorticoids, the ALP can remain elevated for weeks to months despite discontinuation of the drug. 20,21 ALP increases had declined to within the reference range after 3 weeks, and had resolved within 5 weeks in the dogs reported here. Phenobarbital-induced ALP changes possibly resolved quickly because phenobarbital levels would rapidly decline after discontinuation (along with its enzymeinducing properties), whereas effects of glucocorticoids persist after the drug has been eliminated. 21 Serum ALT is increased secondary to hepatocellular damage or drug-induced enzyme induction. 22 Serum AST is often concurrently elevated when hepatocellular injury is present. 22 In the dogs of this study, neither cytologic evidence of hepatocellular damage nor AST elevation occurred, supporting the idea that the ALT elevation was induced secondary to phenobarbital. 12 The half-life of serum ALT is approximately 1-2 days, and ALT is expected to decrease over 1-2 weeks after hepatic damage ceases. 22 In a study of 6 dogs with hepatopathy induced by glucocorticoid administration, ALT elevations persisted for 6 weeks after discontinuation of the steroids. 21 This is comparable to the 5 weeks that it took for the dogs of this report to return to pretreatment values. Although reasons for this persistent elevation are unknown, it should be noted that none of the ALT values were above reference ranges after discontinuation of phenobarbital.",

This finding could support the idea that phenobarbital induces a defect in albumin synthesis, with a rebound effect resulting in an increase in albumin after the drug is discontinued.

Phenobarbital-induced hepatic enzyme induction may result in increased clearance of triiodothyronine (T 3 ) and T 4 by the liver, as is the case in rodents. 13 Increased conversion of T 4 to T 3 in peripheral tissues may also play a role. 10, 11 Subsequent to decreased peripheral T 4 concentrations, TSH concentration may be increased as a result of loss of feedback. 24 In the dogs of this report, thyroid hormone changes resolved in 1 (TT 4 ) to 5 (FT 4 ) weeks after phenobarbital was discontinued. Mild elevations in TSH concentrations that occurred during phenobarbital administration resolved immediately after discontinuation of the drug at week 27. 12 A lack of TSH increase upon phenobarbital withdrawal supports the theory that hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid gland axis suppression plays a minimal role in TT 4 and FT 4 depression during phenobarbital administration. Therefore, other mechanisms such as increased metabolism of thyroid hormone by the liver may be more likely. Perhaps if TSH concentrations are increased during the withdrawal period, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism should be considered. However, careful and repeated evaluation of the patient's thyroid status is recommended to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism because FT 4 concentrations could still be depressed by 10 weeks after withdrawal (see Fig 3) . Further studies that follow dogs for a longer time period are needed to determine exactly how long thyroid hormone changes persist after phenobarbital is withdrawn. Further studies might also evaluate the measurement of TT 4 and FT 4 6 hours post-TSH injection in normal dogs before, during, and after chronic phenobarbital therapy for its usefulness in accurately measuring thyroid function in dogs during phenobarbital therapy. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that thyroid values be evaluated at least 6 weeks after cessation of phenobarbital.",
