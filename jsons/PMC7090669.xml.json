Scientists studying the evolutionary history of HIV found that it is closely related to other viruses. Those viruses include simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), which infect primates, and the more distantly related FIVs (the feline strains), which infect cats. SIV made the evolutionary leap to human hosts and evolved into the virus we now know as HIV.

When biologist JBS Haldane was asked what he could conclude about the nature of God from his studies of biology, Haldane is said to have replied that God must have an inordinate fondness for beetles. By some estimates, beetles make up 22% of all described species! How did we end up with so many beetle species? Host-switching may have had something to do with it. Beetle lineages that switched from feeding on a nonflowering plant to feeding on a flowering plant (an angiosperm) during their evolutionary history seem to have experienced a pulse of diversification.

Two hundred years ago, the ancestors of apple maggot flies laid their eggs only on hawthorns, but today, these flies lay eggs on both hawthorns (which are native to America) and domestic apples (which were introduced to America by immigrants). This host-switching seems to underlie a recent split within the fly lineage between those that lay eggs on apples and those that lay eggs on hawthorns. In fact, scientists suspect that in the apple maggot fly, we are catching a rare glimpse of speciation in its early stages\u2014usually we only find out about such speciation events after the fact!
