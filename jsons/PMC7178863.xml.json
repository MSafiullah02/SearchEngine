This is an area of intense research with the pathophysiology underlying these clinical conditions becoming progressively better understood. This improved understanding has resulted in new therapeutic strategies that are being assessed in multicenter clinical trials. The chapter will begin by describing the incidence and pathophysiologic significance of anemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) providing a differential diagnosis of the many conditions that may present with anemia in this setting. The chapter will next consider disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) focusing on the pathophysiology of a condition that has been associated with much morbidity and mortality. The underlying conditions predisposing to DIC will be detailed as well as a number of treatment options that have been implemented in clinical trials. In addition to DIC, thrombocytopenia may be caused by a number of other clinical conditions important to the pediatric critical care provider. The clinical and prognostic significance of thrombocytopenia will be addressed and a focused differential diagnosis will be provided. Thrombotic disorders are becoming increasingly recognized in children and are a particular concern for the pediatric intensivist. The epidemiology of thromboembolism in children will be reviewed focusing on the conditions most commonly associated with these thromboses. Finally, a chapter on hematologic issues in the critically ill child would not be complete without a discussion of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome, one of the most frequent complications of sickle cell disease resulting in the need for intensive care services, will be discussed in detail.",

The lower limit of normal for age is usually defined as two standard deviations below the norm. Although other indicators may be used to define anemia, the hemoglobin concentration is most commonly used because of its accuracy, reproducibility, and because it is most indicative of the pathophysiologic consequences of anemia. Normal hemoglobin values vary by age and gender, and to some degree, by race (Table 38.1). Children ages 6 months to 12 years have more 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in their red blood cells (RBCs), and thus, can tolerate lower hemoglobin levels than adults because of the rightward shift of the oxygen \u00addisassociation curve. Anemia is a symptom and not a disease, but the primary cause is in the hematopoietic system more often in children than in adults.\nOne third of children admitted to a multidisciplinary ICU are anemic at the time of admission.\n",

Among adults, data suggests that as many as 77% of patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit have some degree of anemia, and by day 3, almost 95% of patients are anemic. The prevalence of anemia in children admitted to an ICU is less well established, but appears less than that of adults. A prospective multicenter study was recently completed, and determined that most (74%) children admitted to the PICU were either anemic upon admission (33%) or developed anemia while in the PICU (41%). An interesting finding from this study was that 73% of the blood loss that occurred was related to blood draws. One-half of the children required packed red blood cells transfusions while in the PICU, with most of the first transfusions occurring within 48 h of PICU admission. In that study, transfusion in the PICU was associated with worse outcome, and the authors concluded that it is imperative to minimize blood loss from blood draws and to set clear transfusion thresholds in the PICU.The following factors may contribute to anemia in the critically ill: (1) frequent blood sampling (2) clinically apparent or occult blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract (3) blood loss during surgical procedures preceding admission to the ICU (4) blood loss due to trauma preceding admission to the ICU (5) inappropriately low circulating levels of and/or diminished responsiveness to erythropoietin.\n",

Manifestations of anemia are usually dependent on five factors: (1) the reduction in oxygen carrying capacity, (2) the change in total blood volume, (3) the rate at which these two changes have occurred, (4) the capacity of the cardiopulmonary system to compensate, and (5) the underlying disorder that resulted in anemia. In light of this, the hemoglobin concentration alone is not the sole determinant of the severity of the anemia. The clinical findings of anemia are primarily the result of compensatory mechanisms to prevent tissue hypoxia secondary to decreased oxygen carrying capacity.

            "text": "In an attempt to prevent this tissue hypoxia, several compensatory mechanisms are activated. First, the RBCs generate increased 2,3-DPG that results in a decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Given the high oxygen pressures in the alveoli, this has a minimal effect on the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the lungs. However, in the tissue beds of the body, increased 2,3-DPG results in more oxygen being released to the tissues (rightward shift of the oxygen disassociation curve). Second, additional capillary beds open within vital organs, thereby minimizing the distance from the oxygen supply to the cells. Since the blood volume in anemia is unchanged or decreased, this increased perfusion can only occur with decreased perfusion to other, less vital parts of the body and/or an increased cardiac output. Data suggests that in anemic states, vasoconstriction occurs primarily in the cutaneous tissue and in the kidneys. The kidneys usually maintain a very low arterio-venous oxygen difference, and thus, can tolerate a significant decrease in perfusion without experiencing tissue hypoxia. The decreased skin perfusion results in the pallor commonly appreciated during anemia. Cardiac output and blood flow velocities are also increased to maintain tissue perfusion. This occurs in children primarily through an increased heart rate although the decreased blood viscosity and a decreased systemic vascular resistance from the opening of the capillary beds also contribute. Other signs of increased cardiac activity include the presence of murmurs, bruits, and venous hums. It has been suggested that the tinnitus commonly associated with anemia, may merely represent the internal detection of bruits. With severe, prolonged anemia, the increased cardiac output may result in hyperdynamic cardiac failure with fluid retention. In such situations, RBC transfusions must be administered in small aliquots extremely slowly (over several hours) with close monitoring of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and fluid status. Finally, to compensate for decreased oxygen carrying capacity, the body will both increase production of RBCs and decrease their destruction in the face of anemia. The increased RBC production is secondary to increased synthesis of erythropoietin as the rate of erythropoietin production is inversely proportional to the hemoglobin level (Fig. 38-1). Studies have suggested that this erythropoietin response to anemia, however, may be blunted in critical illness.\n",

For example, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) enables the classification of the anemia by the RBC size (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic). The RBC volume distribution width (RDW) reflects the variability in RBC size and may be useful in distinguishing between specific etiologies of anemia (Fig. 38-2).\nAnemia is not a diagnosis, but rather a symptom of an underlying disorder, and as such, the diagnostic goal is to determine the etiology of the disorder and to provide appropriate therapy.\n",

The reticulocyte count is useful in distinguishing between these two general categories. However, because the reticulocyte count is often reported as a percentage, it needs to be adjusted for the total number of RBCs present. This adjustment is made by simply multiplying the patient\u2019s reticulocyte percentage by his/her hematocrit divided by an age-, gender-appropriate normal hematocrit value. With this correction, a reticulocyte percentage <2% suggests decreased production while a percentage \u22652% reflects an appropriate response to blood loss or hemolysis.

The congenital form, Diamond-Blackfan Syndrome, is a rare and potentially severe form of macrocytic anemia usually presenting early in the first year of life. In addition to the markedly decreased hemoglobin, the reticulocyte count is extremely low while the white blood cell count is normal to mildly decreased with platelet counts that may be normal, increased or decreased. Serum bilirubin levels are normal while erythropoietin levels are elevated. Analysis of the bone marrow is most helpful as there is marked reduction, or absence of erythroid precursors, while the other cell lines are normal yielding a markedly increased myeloid to erythroid ratio. Forty percent of the patients have associated physical abnormalities (short stature, facial, cardiac, and renal abnormalities). Transfusions of packed RBCs are often required at presentation, and may be required long term. Approximately two-thirds of patients will respond to corticosteroids. Those children who do not respond to corticosteroids will likely not respond to other therapies and may require chronic transfusion therapy or be considered for HSCT. Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is a moderate to severe form of normocytic anemia usually occurring over 1 year of age in otherwise healthy children. It is believed to be secondary to a circulating immunoglobin that inhibits colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) or burst-forming unit-erythroid and it resolves spontaneously without therapy. In addition to TEC, parvovirus may also infect CFU-E and inhibit erythroid production for a period of 1\u20132 weeks.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. It is most commonly secondary to inadequate dietary intake, but may also result from chronic blood loss. It tends to occur with a bimodal distribution occurring most commonly in late infancy, and again, during adolescence (times of rapid body growth and potentially poor dietary intake). Although it is unlikely to result in critical illness by itself, functional iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in critically ill adult patients and the role of iron supplementation in this population needs to be better defined. \u03b1-Thalassemia trait (deletion of two of the four \u03b1-globins) is asymptomatic and may be distinguished from iron deficiency by the presence of an elevated (>5 million) RBC count, a normal RDW and normal iron studies. Deletion of three \u03b1-globins results in Hemoglobin H disease which is associated with a moderately severe hemolytic anemia, and the deletion of all four \u03b1-globins produces hydrops fetalis. Heterozygous \u03b2-thalassemia is a mild microcytic anemia that requires no therapy, however, homozygous \u03b2-thalassemia is severe, requiring hypertransfusion and chelation therapy. These children present during the first few months of life with a severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Splenectomy is often necessary. HSCT is being used successfully as a cure for many of these patients. Lead poisoning should be considered in the differential of a microcytic anemia and is associated with basophilic stippling of the red cell. It tends to occur together with iron deficiency.",

Hereditary spherocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defect, and mode of inheritance. Hereditary spherocytosis is often dominantly inherited, most commonly found in Caucasians, and often presents during childhood with anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly.

There are three major classes of acquired hemolytic anemia based on the mechanism of RBC injury: immune-mediated, microangiopathic, or infectious. The immune-mediated hemolytic anemias occur as a result of antibodies directed against RBC antigens. They are classified as autoimmune, alloimmune, or drug-induced based on the antigen that stimulates the destruction of the RBC. Autoimmune hemolysis is mediated by autoantibodies (typically IgG) that attach to RBC surface antigens. These antibody-coated RBCs are partially ingested by macrophages in the spleen with proteolytic enzymes on the macrophage surface digesting portions of the RBC membrane. This process results in the formation of a microspherocyte, an RBC with the lowest surface area to volume ratio, which is the hallmark of autoimmune hemolysis. These microspherocytes are trapped in the spleen because of their poor deformability. The direct antiglobulin test, or Coombs\u2019 test, demonstrates the presence of antibodies or complement on the surface of the RBC and is another hallmark of autoimmune hemolysis. The clinical presentation varies, although the anemia may be severe with hemoglobin values < 6 g/dL. Other non-specific laboratory findings of hemolysis may also be appreciated. Although autoimmune hemolysis may occur with lymphoproliferative diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, and immunodeficiency disorders, the majority of cases are idiopathic. Corticosteroids are the primary treatment. Splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy have been used in refractory cases. Transfusions may be required, but offer only transient improvement and completely compatible blood is often difficult to find. Cold agglutinin disease is another form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. These IgM autoantibodies attach to RBCs preferentially at cold temperatures (4  \u201318\u00b0C). The most common type of cold agglutinin disease, occurs primarily in adults. However, a second form may occur in children following a variety of infectious processes most notably M. pneumoniae and infectious mononucleosis.

Tissue factor, an integral membrane glycoprotein, is normally expressed on cells extrinsic to the vascular compartment, but its expression can be induced in monocytes, and perhaps, in endothelial cells by inflammatory mediators. In severe sepsis, mononuclear and endothelial cells, stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-6, express tissue factor which leads to activation of the coagulation cascade. Tissue factor expressed at the cell surface interacts with factor VII ultimately forming a tissue factor-factor VIIa complex (extrinsic factor Xase) that catalyzes the activation of factors IX and X (factor X being activated more efficiently) (Fig. 38-3). The initial factor Xa produced catalyzes the conversion of small amounts of prothrombin to thrombin in a highly inefficient manner. However, the formation of this small amount of thrombin, known as the initiation phase, is essential as it accelerates the process by activating platelets, factor V, and factor VIII. Once factor VIIIa is formed, it combines with factor IXa (generated by the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex) on the activated platelet membrane to form the \u201cintrinsic factor Xase\u201d which becomes the major activator of factor X. The factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex is 105\u2013106 fold more active than factor IXa alone, and several fold more efficient than the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, in activating factor X.

First, antithrombin, which combines with thrombin to form thrombin-antithrombin complexes and thereby serve as the principal inhibitor of thrombin, is found in very low levels during DIC. These decreased levels of antithrombin are secondary to increased consumption, decreased synthesis, and degradation by elastases from activated neutrophils. Additionally, antithrombin function is impaired because of decreased availability of glycosaminoglycan, a physiologic cofactor of antithrombin, on the dysfunctional endothelial cells. The finding that decreased levels of antithrombin precede clinical findings of sepsis supports a pathogenic role of these decreased levels. Second, there is decreased function of the protein C pathway as a result of both decreased levels and down-regulation of thrombomodulin. The decreased levels are secondary to increased consumption and decreased synthesis. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1B inhibit protein C activity by down-regulating thrombomodulin expression on endothelial cells. The third major endogenous anticoagulant, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), normally functions to inhibit thrombin formation by inactivating the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex by forming a quaternary structure with it and factor Xa. The role of TFPI in the pathogenesis of DIC, however, is not completely clear. Although clinical studies have failed to demonstrate decreased levels of TFPI in the majority of patients with DIC, administration of recombinant TFPI has been found to block inflammation-induced thrombin generation in humans. Moreover, although endogenous concentrations of TFPI are seemingly insufficient to regulate the deranged coagulation process during inflammatory conditions, pharmacological doses of TFPI have been reported to decrease mortality during systemic inflammation suggesting that high concentrations of TFPI are capable of modulating tissue factor-mediated coagulation.",

After an initial, brief increase in fibrinolytic activation, inhibition of fibrinolysis occurs primarily as a result of sustained increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulate PAI-1 synthesis and release, and decrease plasminogen activator synthesis. In addition to endothelial cells, PAI-1 may also be released from activated platelets.

For example, factor Xa, thrombin, fibrin, and the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex have all been found to elicit proinflammatory processes. More specifically, the binding of thrombin to specific cell receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) appears to be the primary mechanism by which this proinflammatory response is induced. These PARs are located in the vasculature on endothelial cells, platelets, mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Four PARs are known in humans. Human PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 can be activated by thrombin while PAR2 is activated by the tissue-factor-factor VIIa complex and factor Xa, but not by thrombin. The effect of these coagulation proteins on inflammation is supported by the clinical finding that infusion of recombinant factor VIIa in healthy human subjects results in small, but significant increases in the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8; a response that is absent when volunteers are pretreated with an inhibitor of tissue factor-factor VIIa. In addition to the effect of these coagulation proteins, the three endogenous anticoagulant pathways can also influence inflammation. For example, activated protein C has been found to inhibit TNF-alpha release from monocytes both in vitro and in vivo and to block leukocyte adhesion in vivo. It has also been demonstrated to inhibit endotoxin-induced production of IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 in cultured monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, inhibition of the protein C pathway increases cytokine elaboration, endothelial cell injury and leukocyte extravasation in response to endotoxin; processes that are decreased by the infusion of activated protein C. Moreover, infusion of recombinant activated protein C accelerated the decrease of IL-6 levels in humans with severe sepsis. In addition, recent laboratory experiments demonstrate common pathways in which coagulation directly relates to innate immunity against pathogens and microorganisms, contributing to the inflammation-coagulation interface. Briefly, infectious processes are responsible for recruiting cells and proteins that facilitate both immunity and coagulation (i.e. neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs]). Likewise, thrombomodulin, the protein that binds to thrombin with subsequent activation of protein C, is also involved in the negative regulatory effect of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a cytokine storm elicitor, contributing to the direct inactivation of complement C3b, and the indirect inactivation of complement C5a and C3a. Clearly, there are data supporting an influence on the inflammatory response by coagulation processes and this remains an area of much interest and research.The activation of coagulation has been shown to contribute to proinflammatory responses. The binding of thrombin to specific cell receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) appears to be the primary mechanism by which this proinflammatory response is induced.\n",

As stated above, it is always secondary to an underlying disorder and there are a wide variety of conditions that may result in DIC (Table 38-3). In pediatrics, sepsis is one of the most common etiologies of DIC. It is interesting to note that, in bacterial sepsis, there is no difference in the incidence of DIC between gram negative and gram positive organisms. In both cases, DIC is triggered either by specific components from the microorganism cell membrane (lipopolyssacharide or endotoxin) or bacterial exotoxins (e.g. staphylococcal alpha toxin). In addition to sepsis, DIC is commonly found in severe trauma patients and is closely linked to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and worse outcomes. A combination of factors may contribute to the triggering of DIC in severe trauma, but clearly, activation of the cytokine network in a manner similar to sepsis is an established factor. DIC is also common among patients with cancer. In children, laboratory evidence of DIC has been reported in 3% of untreated patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and in nearly 14% of those with acute myelocytic leukemia. Children with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) appear to be at increased risk. DIC has also been reported among children with neuroblastoma and other solid tumors usually in the setting of extensive disease. The pathophysiology of DIC in cancer is less well established although expression of high levels of tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, hyperfibrinolysis in the setting of activated coagulation (APL), and the release of cytokines that influence the prothrombotic potential, adhesive properties and permeability of the vascular endothelium have all been suggested. Vascular disorders such as giant hemangiomas or aneurysms may lead to local activation of coagulation. This phenomenon can lead to an imbalance of systemic coagulation with subsequent consumption of platelets and coagulation factors.",

However, their utility is limited because they lack specificity and are not readily available. Tests that are likely to be routinely available include tests for fibrin degradation products (FDPs) and d-dimers. d-dimers are specific degradation products that can only result from the digestion of cross-linked fibrin. These tests are useful in that they are sensitive markers for DIC, and a normal d-dimer value has a high negative predictive value; however, they too lack specificity. Fibrinogen levels have been suggested as a useful tool for the diagnosis of DIC. However, because fibrinogen is as an acute-phase reactant, levels can remain within the normal range for a long time despite active DIC, making it a less sensitive test. Serial monitoring of fibrinogen levels, as well as these other tests, is more useful than a single result in establishing the diagnosis of DIC. Another method, the waveform aPTT, has been found to be both a sensitive and specific detector of DIC in adults. This test analyzes the waveform produced by changes in light transmittance upon re-calcification of citrated plasma displayed by an automated laboratory machine while measuring the aPTT. In contrast to the normal sigmoid-shaped aPTT waveform, a biphasic waveform identified DIC in a study of 1,470 samples with 98% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and a positive predictive value of 74%. These changes seem to precede the more classical laboratory markers of DIC by approximately 24 h.The waveform aPTT has recently been found to be both a sensitive and specific detector of DIC.\n",

Some authors suggest that the use of therapeutic heparin is indicated in conditions with overt thromboembolism or with extensive fibrin deposition such as purpura fulminans or acral ischemia.

Given the pathophysiology of inflammation-mediated DIC, inhibitors of tissue factor appear to be logical therapeutic agents. In a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial of nearly 2,000 septic adults, recombinant tissue factor inhibitor (tifacogin) failed to improve all cause 28-day mortality among patients with an INR  \u2265  1.2. Patients treated with this medication failed to show improvement in any of the protocol-specified secondary end points and use of the drug was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Among treated patients with an INR  <  1.2 in that trial, there was a strong trend towards improved survival although the increased bleeding risk persisted. Another potential therapy is the recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2) which is a potent inhibitor of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex. Its mechanism of action is distinct from tissue factor pathway inhibitor. In a phase 1 study in healthy, male volunteers, intravenous rNAPc2 was found to be safe and well tolerated. A single dose completely blocked endotoxin-induced thrombin generation without affecting the fibrinolytic response and attenuated the endotoxin-induced rise in IL-10, without affecting other cytokines. Blockade of IL-6 is another therapeutic consideration. Since IL-6 is postulated to be responsible for tissue factor expression in mononuclear and endothelial cells during severe sepsis, it is plausible that IL-6 blockade may inhibit activation of the coagulation cascade. Based on encouraging results in primates, a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of a monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody was conducted in healthy volunteers who received a lipopolysaccharide infusion. Unfortunately, the use of the IL-6 antagonist failed to decrease lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue factor mRNA transcription or plasma concentrations of any of the downstream coagulation factors. Finally, inactivated recombinant factor VIIa, which inhibits the binding of factor VIIa to tissue factor, has been reported to prevent tissue factor-induced thrombosis in animal models and to have potent antithrombotic effects in a perfusion chamber ex vivo human study.

Decreased production is often associated with underproduction of other cell lines characterizing an inherited or an acquired bone marrow failure syndrome. However, bone marrow abnormalities associated with isolated thrombocytopenia may occur including the thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR) syndrome as well as the X-linked thrombocytopenia. Increased destruction is the most common etiology of thrombocytopenia observed in the PICU setting. It may be identified by an elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) which measures the average size of circulating platelets. During escalated platelet destruction, the body compensates with increased production of platelets, and thus, the overall age of the platelets decreases as few survive to senescence. These young platelets tend to be large resulting in an elevated MPV. In this way, an elevated MPV may provide indirect evidence of increased platelet destruction. These younger, larger platelets may have better function than older platelets and the larger membrane area per platelet partially compensates for decreased platelet numbers. Thrombocytopenia secondary to increased destruction can be divided into immune or non-immune causes. Among the immune causes, infections of all types (viral, bacterial, protozoan) appear to be the most common in the PICU. Among the non-immune group, DIC, vascular anomalies, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and catheter-related thromboses are most common. Platelet sequestration is an example of distributional thrombocytopenia and may result in a decreased number of circulating platelets despite a potentially normal platelet mass. Normally, 30% of the platelet mass resides in the spleen; however, in conditions associated with splenic enlargement as much as 80\u201390% of the platelet mass may be contained within the spleen. Table 38-4 highlights a differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in the PICU by pathophysiologic etiology.

It is generally a benign and self-limited process and it is very different than ITP in adults. It usually presents with petechiae and non-palpable ecchymoses a few weeks after a viral infection. The physical exam is essentially unremarkable, notable for its absence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and joint swelling. Platelet counts can frequently be very low (<10,000/\u03bcL) and the WBC count is usually normal. For the same degree of thrombocytopenia, there is an apparent lower tendency to bleed with ITP because the platelets tend to be younger, larger (elevated MPV), and more effective than older, smaller platelets. A bleeding score based on the initial physical findings has been established in pediatrics that allows for a semi-quantitative assessment of hemorrhage in children with ITP. Therapy for ITP at diagnosis remains controversial and guidelines have been published by both the British and American Societies of Hematology. In the event of severe, life-threatening bleeding, platelet transfusions, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and even splenectomy may be considered. Platelet transfusions are only indicated for life-threatening hemorrhage in ITP. Postulated mechanisms for steroid efficacy include stabilization of vascular integrity, decreased synthesis of autoantibodies, and decreased clearance of antibody-coated platelets by white blood cells. IVIG works by blocking Fc receptor-mediated clearance of antibody-coated platelets by mononuclear, phagocytic cells. IVIG also seems to provide immune-modulation of the phagocytic system. Intravenous anti-D immune globulin has also been offered as a potential therapy for ITP, but should be used with caution in the setting of a decreased hemoglobin concentration or hemolysis.",

HUS classically occurs as a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure following a prodrome of bloody diarrhea. HUS has been linked to a verotoxin-producing E. coli 0157:H7 and Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 as well as a number of other infectious agents. A subset of patients develops HUS with no evidence of a verotoxin-producing infection, but rather with a mutation in regulatory proteins of the complement pathway including factor H, membrane cofactor protein, and serine protease factor I. Such mutations result in impaired protection of host surfaces against complement activation and it is likely that they predispose to, rather than directly cause thrombotic microangiopathy. The thrombocytopenia of HUS appears related to increased platelet activation and enhanced platelet aggregation as a result of prostaglandin imbalance. Renal dysfunction is a prominent feature of HUS, more so, than in TTP.Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) classically occurs as a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure following a \u00adprodrome of bloody diarrhea.\nA subset of patients develops HUS with no evidence of a verotoxin-producing infection, but rather with a mutation in a regulatory protein of the \u00adcomplement pathway.\n",

Its incidence in pediatrics has not been well established, although a previous report in children in the intensive care setting had an incidence of 2.3%. Unlike other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT does not usually cause bleeding, but rather, thrombosis, as it is mediated by antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 (H-PF4) complex, potentially leading to platelet activation and thrombosis. The diagnosis should be suspected when a patient has received heparin for more than four days (including small amounts of heparin used to flush lines as well as (although less commonly) low molecular weight heparin), or has had prior exposure to heparin, and develops new thrombocytopenia in the absence of other new diagnoses that are associated with a decreased platelet count. HIT should especially be suspected in a PICU patient whose admitting illness has stabilized when unexplained new thrombocytopenia develops, especially in the setting of new thrombosis. A high index of suspicion is warranted since over half of the patients with HIT develop significant thrombosis. A clinical suspicion of HIT can more adequately be assessed using pre-test probability scores and screened for in the laboratory with an ELISA test. It should be confirmed by the serotonin-release test or another functional test. Testing is important since a diagnosis of HIT is an absolute contraindication to continued heparin use. Unfortunately, testing results are not usually available in time to prevent complications of HIT. Therefore, when the diagnosis of HIT is clinically suspected, early initiation of \u00adtreatment may be justified in the setting of high or moderate clinical pre-test probability. Treatment includes removal of all heparin (including flushes for \u00adintravenous lines) and the use of a thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban or lepirudin, or the use of a new anticoagulant agent such as bivalirudin.

Interestingly, the same basic mechanisms involved in the formation of a hemostatic plug that stops bleeding can also lead to the obstruction of blood flow and tissue death in cases of inappropriate regulation. Hemostasis is therefore based on a critical balance between opposite forces that regulate fibrin formation and dissolution. Procoagulant mechanisms and natural anticoagulant inhibitors are intrinsically related in a delicate equilibrium that can be disturbed towards coagulation due to an inherited or acquired condition that will either lead to excessive prothrombotic stimuli or lack of proper coagulation inhibition. Overall, thrombin is the most powerful procoagulant protein in this system and the goal of the coagulation cascade is to generate thrombin and to promote the formation of a stable clot. On the other hand, the natural anticoagulant systems (e.g. antithrombin, protein C system) together with the endothelial (i.e. heparin cofactor II) and the fibrinolytic system will act as a counterbalance to clot formation.

These predisposing conditions may or may not be expressed as thrombosis, depending on environmental insults, the strength and number of predisposing factors, and the presence of other genetic abnormalities associated with hypercoagulability. There are some data to suggest that in children with VTE, the presence of a genetic prothrombotic disorder is a strong predictor of a recurrent episode.

It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with two types of abnormalities: one associated with reduced plasma levels of a functionally normal AT (Type I), and the other covering the two types of dysfunctional AT (Type II) (active-site defect and heparin binding-site defect). AT exerts its anticoagulant effect primarily by inactivating thrombin and factor Xa. AT bound to heparan sulfate molecules of the vascular endothelium inactivates thrombin, factor Xa, factor IXa, and factor XIa. It accomplishes this by forming a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the activated clotting factor. Of note, AT levels are approximately half the normal adult levels at birth and increase to adult values by 6 months of life. Interestingly, levels of another thrombin inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, are elevated at birth and remain elevated through the second decade of life perhaps rendering a protective effect against thromboembolism during these years. Individuals with heterozygous AT deficiency usually present with venous thrombosis in early adulthood; while homozygous Type I AT deficiency is likely incompatible with life. Homozygous AT-Type II is rare, and is associated with an extremely high risk of VTE during childhood. There are several acquired causes of AT deficiency including DIC, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, oral contraceptives, asparaginase therapy, and heparin therapy. The AT plasmatic activity measured by chromogenic assays are probably the best screening tests for AT-deficiency.Protein C, a vitamin K dependent protein, is activated when thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin.

There are three distinct forms of this deficiency: Type I has decreased total and free protein S levels with concomitant decreased function; Type II has normal total and free levels, but it is dysfunctional; Type III has sufficient total levels, but decreased free protein S, and therefore, decreased function. Interestingly, levels in neonates are only 30% of adult levels, but C4b-BP levels are also decreased, and thus, function is basically normal. Several acquired factors result in decreased levels including pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, human immunodeficiency virus and varicella infections, liver disease and asparaginase therapy. In light of these acquired deficiencies, repeat sampling and family testing is required for definitive diagnosis. Acute thromboembolic events including DIC result in increased C4b-BP levels, and therefore, decreased protein S activity. Total levels are increased in nephrotic syndrome, but free levels are decreased.Protein S is an important cofactor for protein C.

Rare forms of hyperhomocysteinemia result from inherited enzyme deficiencies, specifically methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathionine-beta-synthase. The former is secondary to a mutation leading to loss of enzymatic activity resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia in the presence of folate deficiency. The latter presents with the classic clinical picture of homocystinuria characterized by mental retardation, ectopic lenses, skeletal abnormalities, and thromboembolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia may also result from a number of acquired disorders including deficiencies of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 because these are key cofactors in the normal breakdown of homocysteine.

The antiphospholipid antibodies comprise a group of heterogeneous IgG, IgM or IgA antibodies that are developed as either a primary phenomenon (i.e. antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) or secondary to an acute infection, an autoimmune disorder, or to medications. It is usually an acquired condition that manifests clinically as thrombosis (venous and/or arterial), thrombocytopenia, livido reticularis, and/or pregnancy loss. It can be divided into two broad types: the lupus anticoagulant and the anticardiolipin antibody syndromes. The name antiphospholipid is actually a misnomer, since the antibodies are mostly directed against proteins in combination with the ionic, negatively charged \u00adphospholipids (i.e. phosphatidylserine). There are several possible mechanisms to explain the procoagulant state including inhibition of the protein C system (acquired protein C resistance) as well as abnormal interactions with the complement system or with annexin V. The assays used to detect such abnormalities are classically divided into solid phase and fluid, clot-based assays. In the former, solid phase assays containing antibodies directed towards B2-glycoprotein-1 (B2GP-1) and anticardiolipin antibodies are detected by ELISA. In the latter, phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays are inhibited \u2018in vitro\u2019 by the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies leading to prolonged clotting times. In the past, lupus anticoagulant was usually identified in children by a prolonged aPTT during pre-surgical screening. However, as more laboratories are now using lupus-insensitive reagents, a prolonged aPTT cannot reliably detect lupus anticoagulant. In testing for lupus anticoagulant, it is important for the laboratory to adhere to the guidelines published by the ISTH. In essence, at least two screening tests for a lupus anticoagulant should be performed. In the event of a detected abnormality, a mixing study should be performed to demonstrate that the abnormal test is due to an inhibitor rather than a clotting factor deficiency. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of the antibodies needs to be neutralized by an excess of phospholipids. In children, these antibodies are commonly transient; however, there are instances in which these findings persist.The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an acquired hypercoagulable state diagnosed by the presence of a persistent antiphospholipid antibody commonly associated with a thrombotic event.\n",

Although a definitive understanding of the prothrombotic pathophysiology is still lacking, much has been established. Most notably, given the significant homology that apolipoprotein (a) possesses with plasminogen, it is postulated that a portion of the plasminogen activators binds apolipoprotein (a) rather than plasminogen resulting in reduced plasmin generation and decreased clot lysis. This also results in reduced production of transforming growth factor-B with consequent smooth muscle cell proliferation.

Moreover, extrapolation of adult thrombosis data may not be appropriate as there are clear differences between children and adults. For example, although increasingly recognized, thrombosis in children is a relatively rare event in comparison to adults. Several factors for this decreased risk in children have been postulated including differences in the coagulation profile, a decreased potential for thrombin generation and a vascular endothelium that has not endured years of potentially damaging exposures. Moreover, in children, vascular endothelial cells express more heparin cofactor 2 than adults potentially contributing to the decreased risk of VTE. Additionally, thromboses in children are almost always associated with a predisposing risk factor with less than 10% considered idiopathic. In contrast, 30\u201340% of adult thromboses have no identified predisposing factor.

It is now recognized that the actual mechanism is much more complicated, although the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S resulting in less deformable cells remains the primary event in the pathogenesis of SCD. This polymerization occurs as a result of the substitution of valine for glutamic acid allowing complimentary globin chains to bind, forming rope-like fibers that align with others to form a bundle, distorting the red cell into a classic crescent or sickled form. This polymerization is dependent on the intraerythrocytic hemoglobin S concentration, the degree of cell deoxygenation, the pH, and the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin F. Interestingly, the process of polymerization is slow relative to transit times through the capillary bed, and thus, many cells do not undergo polymerization. However, if transit times in the capillary bed are prolonged, then the red cells, as a result of exposure to lower oxygen tensions for longer periods of time, almost all undergo polymerization resulting in less deformable cells. These polymer-containing cells are trapped in the slow flowing venular side of the microcirculation. This sludging eventually leads to the formation of heterocellular aggregates of leukocytes and poorly deformable erythrocytes that adhere to the endothelium. These aggregates fuel the process of vaso-occlusion by creating further local hypoxia, increased transit times, increased hemoglobin S polymer formation, and propagation of the occlusion.The polymerization of \u00addeoxygenated hemoglobin S resulting in less deformable erythrocytes remains the primary event in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease.\nThe formation of heterocellular aggregates of leukocytes and poorly deformable erythrocytes fuel the process of vaso-occlusion by creating further local hypoxia, increased capillary transit times, increased hemoglobin S polymer formation, and propagation of the occlusion.\n",

These pathophysiologic changes increase the rate of blood flow through the middle cerebral artery. The rate of blood flow through the middle cerebral artery can be measured by transcranial doppler ultrasound and this has been found to be a useful index for monitoring the severity of neurovascular disease in these patients. Treatment of a cerebrovascular accident in this setting consists of an immediate exchange transfusion to reduce the percentage of hemoglobin S to less than 30%. In addition, standard neuroprotective interventions should be implemented to prevent an ischemic cascade. Long-term hypertransfusion therapy to keep the hemoglobin S percentage to less than 30 has been shown to reduce the incidence of a repeat stroke from 50% to 10% in a 3-year follow-up study. However, recent studies have reported the occurrence of silent infarcts despite transfusion therapy.

The microvasculature occlusion tends to occur in bones involved in marrow production (such as long bones, ribs, sternum, and pelvis) usually with multiple sites being involved simultaneously. The pain is mediated via activation of nociceptive afferent nerve fibers. This microvascular involvement with its associated pain may persist, mimicking osteomyelitis. Similarly, microvascular occlusion in the mesenteric vessels may mimic an acute abdomen. The hand-foot syndrome is painful swelling due to dactylitis observed in children less than 3 years of age. More than simply a pain crisis, studies suggest that young adults with more frequent vaso-occlusive crises tend to die earlier.

However, in a recent study of nine adults with sickle cell disease who received HSCT with non-myeloablative conditioning regimens and long-term immunosuppression, the transplant resulted in both stable chimerism and resolution of symptoms. Further refinements of this approach with decreased toxicity is likely to increase the number of transplants for SCD because it will increase the number of eligible patients for this therapy.

The goals of therapy should be to prevent the formation of uric acid and to augment its elimination. Malignant cells, because of their high cellular activity and turnover, contain large quantities of nucleic acids that are rapidly released into the bloodstream during tumor lysis. These purine nucleic acids are initially converted to hypoxanthine, and then, into uric acid via the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Fig. 38-7). Allopurinol, a structural analog of hypoxanthine, is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. By competitively inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol decreases production of uric acid and results in a decrease in systemic uric acid levels (Fig. 38-7). However, allopurinol has three key limitations. First, it only prevents the formation of new uric acid and does not enhance the elimination of uric acid formed prior to its administration. Second, it increases the levels of both xanthine and hypoxanthine, increasing the potential for xanthine crystallization and obstructive uropathy since xanthine is even less soluble in urine than uric acid. Fortunately, this potential complication is rarely clinically manifested. Third, allopurinol reduces the degradation of other purines requiring dose reductions in patients receiving medications such as 6-mercaptopurine.\n",

Systemic alkalinization can be used to produce an alkalotic urine (pH between 7.0 and 7.5) that increases the solubility of uric acid thereby facilitating renal elimination. Unfortunately, urine alkalinization decreases the solubility of calcium phosphate, and thus, may worsen renal function due to precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals in renal tubules. Therefore, alkalinization is not recommended in countries in which rasburicase is available to remove uric acid. A recombinant form of urate oxidase, rasburicase, catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin (Fig. 38-7). Allantoin is significantly more soluble in urine than uric acid, and readily excreted by the kidneys.

Although relatively uncommon in children, masses may arise in the mediastinum from a variety of both benign and malignant disorders. A review of several large series reveals non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and neuroblastoma to be the most common diagnoses of mediastinal masses in children. Paramount in their importance is that they represent a potentially \u00adlife-threatening condition. Neural tumors arise from the posterior mediastinum and rarely \u00adproduce any significant airway obstruction. Lymphomas typically arise from the anteriosuperior or middle mediastinum and can be associated with significant cardiopulmonary compromise.",

            "text": "A clear understanding of the pathophysiology that contributes to the precarious state of a mediastinal mass is important in assuring that appropriate therapy is instituted. The mediastinum is a closed space with minimal room for expansion. Masses that arise in that area act as space occupying lesions. As they expand, the structures in the mediastinum must be displaced and/or compressed. In the anteriosuperior and middle mediastinum, these compressed structures include the tracheobronchial tree, the heart, and the great vessels including the superior vena cava. Compression of any of these structures results in a condition known as the superior mediastinal syndrome. This syndrome has been associated with life-threatening airway obstruction, vascular compression resulting in impaired venous return to the heart, neurologic deficits and death. The clinical presentation varies based on the site and severity of the anatomic obstruction or compression. For example, compression of the tracheobronchial tree may result in dyspnea, stridor, cough, orthopnea, and/or other respiratory symptoms. One report suggests that 60% of children with mediastinal masses will present with respiratory symptoms. Compression of the superior vena cava may cause venous engorgement, head and neck edema, and /or altered mental status. Direct cardiac compression may produce cyanosis, syncope and dysrhythmias.Masses in the anteriosuperior and middle mediastinum may compress the tracheobronchial tree, the heart, and the great vessels resulting in life-threatening airway obstruction and vascular compression.\nA logical approach to the diagnostic work-up of a mediastinal mass should be implemented balancing the likelihood of a definitive result with the risk of the diagnostic procedure.\n",

The definitive diagnosis may be secured in a number of ways, and ideally, the diagnosis needs to be made in the least invasive manner possible. Identifying patients at risk from these life-threatening complications is crucial. It is estimated that 7\u201319% of patients with a mediastinal mass will develop an airway complication with the induction of anesthesia or deep sedation. The pathophysiology of this airway compromise with anesthesia is multifactorial. With the induction of anesthesia, lung volumes are decreased secondary to weakened or abolished inspiratory muscle tone and increased abdominal muscle tone. Additionally, bronchial smooth muscle is relaxed resulting in increased compressibility of the large airways and decreased expiratory flow rates. This exacerbates the effects of the extrinsic compression. Third, the use of neuromuscular blockade eliminates the caudad movement of the diaphragm observed during spontaneous respiration, thereby, decreasing the transpleural pressure gradient. The transpleural gradient dilates the airways during inspiration, and when decreased, results in decreased airway caliber also augmenting the effect of the extrinsic compression. Additionally, supine positioning may result in further cephalad displacement of the diaphragm and increased central blood volume. This increased central blood volume results in increased blood being delivered to the tumor, increased tumor volume, and potentially worsening of the obstruction.",

A history of any symptoms of respiratory distress should raise concern of potential airway compromise with sedation. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of pre-operative respiratory symptoms identifies patients at higher risk of airway complications with anesthesia. Orthopnea is particularly important in distinguishing patients at increased risk of compromise with anesthesia. The standard chest radiograph is also an important tool in the evaluation of a child with a mediastinal mass. Most importantly, it establishes the presence of a mediastinal mass as often these children are considered to have asthma or a similar process prior to the initial chest radiograph. In addition, the radiograph may also reveal associated pleural effusions, tracheal compression and/or tracheal deviation (Fig. 38-8). Masses that exceed 45% of the thoracic diameter on chest x-ray are more likely to be symptomatic than those that are less than 30% of the diameter. It should be noted, however, that patients at risk for airway compromise may have no tracheal compression observed on chest x-ray. Therefore, the chest radiograph is not very helpful for the management or determination of the risk for life-threatening airway compromise. Computed tomography of the chest may be more useful accurately depicting mediastinal involvement, anatomical distortions and the degree of tracheal compression. Additionally, data suggest that general anesthesia may be safely administered if the tracheal cross sectional diameter is greater than 50% of the expected size on CT scan.\nMediastinal masses that exceed 45% of the thoracic diameter on chest x-ray are more likely to be symptomatic than those that are less than 30% of the diameter.\nData suggest that general anesthesia may be safely administered if the tracheal cross sectional diameter is greater than 50% of the expected size on CT scan.\n",

Decreases in the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s have all been reported in patients with a mediastinal mass suggesting both obstructive and restrictive deficits. The PEFR appears to be a useful predicator of airway compromise with a predicted PEFR <50% identifying patients at high risk for airway obstruction with the use of anesthesia. Also, a 12% decrease in pulmonary function can be anticipated when placing the child with a mediastinal mass in the supine, rather than, upright position. It is important to remember that these tests require patient cooperation in both the upright and supine position often making their use impractical particularly in children. Figure 38-9 demonstrates the flow volume loops of a child with a mediastinal mass before and after therapy. Echocardiography is another dynamic test that may be used to assess cardiac function, the presence of a pericardial effusion, impending tamponade, and the integrity of the pulmonary outflow tract.\n",

It is prudent to discuss the condition with all responsible clinical services (nursing, oncology, anesthesia, surgery, pathology, radiation oncology, critical care) to assure the optimal course of action and the appropriate, timely handling of diagnostic specimens. A patient presenting with, or acutely developing, airway obstruction from a mediastinal mass is in a precarious condition of the highest magnitude. Several techniques may be used to decrease the obstruction and/or improve air flow emergently. Repositioning the child from the supine into the upright, lateral, or prone position may be of benefit. Heliox may also improve air movement through the narrowed airway. Bag valve mask ventilation in a spontaneously breathing patient using high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been reported to be useful. If intubation is required, it is preferable to have it performed in the controlled environment of the operating room as described below. If emergent intubation must be performed outside the operating room, it should be performed without the use of neuromuscular blockade by the most experienced person. Reinforced endotracheal tubes of sufficient length to extend beyond the area of tracheal compression should be utilized. If at all possible, both a flexible and rigid fiberoptic bronchoscope should be available and cardiopulmonary bypass should be on standby. Once successfully intubated, the use of PEEP, repositioning of the tube, and/or repositioning of the patient may be needed to facilitate optimal air movement.",

Such procedures may be performed under local anesthesia or with light sedation, but with extreme caution nonetheless. For example, bone marrow aspiration may be used to ascertain a diagnosis, particularly for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Unfortunately, this test may have less utility in other patient populations. Thoracentesis is another diagnostic test that may also be useful in determining the etiology of a mediastinal mass when associated with a pleural effusion. Among malignant masses, pleural effusions are more common in lymphoblastic lymphoma than Hodgkin disease and this diagnosis has been secured using cytological and flow cytometric analysis of the pleural fluid. Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies of superficial lymphadenopathy have also been used to diagnose lymphoblastic lymphoma precluding the need for more invasive procedures. Excisional biopsies of these lymph nodes are more invasive, but still may be performed with local anesthesia and potentially yield more definitive results. If these other diagnostic approaches are unsuccessful, then a mediastinal biopsy must be considered. This may be performed via a percutaneous fine needle aspiration, via a CT-guided core needle biopsy, via mediastinoscopy, or via an open surgical excision.",

First, secure intravenous access must be established and consideration should be given to lower extremity placement as the superior vena cava may have poor inflow due to extrinsic compression. Next, pre-anesthesia sedation or narcotics should be avoided. Both a flexible and rigid fiberoptic bronchoscope should be available and cardiopulmonary bypass should be on standby. The rigid, ventilating bronchoscope is the instrument of choice for the unstable airway. However, it is important to note that if the mediastinal mass is compressing the airway near or beyond the carina, a rigid bronchoscope may still be ineffective as it may not be able to open airways past the occlusion. Induction of anesthesia should be performed in an upright position; however, if the patient cannot tolerate this, then a lateral or prone position should be considered as supine positioning may be associated with worsening of the obstruction. Anesthesia should only be deepened once it is demonstrated that the patient can be easily ventilated with a bag mask set-up. The patient should be intubated with a reinforced endotracheal tube that is passed beyond the obstructed region. In the event of an acute airway occlusion, several maneuvers may be implemented that may be life-saving. Anesthetic effects should be reversed promptly and the patient returned to spontaneous ventilation. Repositioning of the child, in particular utilizing a prone position, may alter the effect of the mass on the airway and facilitate air movement. The ventilating rigid bronchoscope may be advanced beyond the area of obstruction. An emergent thoracotomy with bulk resection of the tumor may be performed to relieve pressure on the airway. However, this should be performed only in extremis as the bleeding and tissue edema involved may actually worsen the effects upon the mediastinum.

In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, fibrin is formed as a result of the generation of thrombin mediated by tissue factor. Tissue factor, expressed on the surface of activated mononuclear cells and endothelial cells, binds and activates factor VII. The complex of tissue factor and factor VIIa can activate factor X directly (black arrows) or indirectly (white arrows) by means of activated factor IX and factor VIII. Activated factor X, in combination with factor V, can convert prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Simultaneously, all three physiologic means of anticoagulation \u2013 antithrombin, protein C, and tissue factor\u2013pathway inhibitor (TFPI) \u2013 are impaired. The resulting intravascular formation of fibrin is not balanced by adequate removal of fibrin because endogenous fibrinolysis is suppressed by high plasma levels of plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The high levels of PAI-1 inhibit plasminogen-activator activity and consequently reduce the rate of formation of plasmin. The combination of increased formation of fibrin and inadequate removal of fibrin results in disseminated intravascular thrombosis.

Each cylinder contains straw-colored clear plasma at the top, a thick layer of white leukemic cells in the middle, and a thin layer of red cells at the bottom. The highly cellular nature of Burkitt lymphoma is evident in Panel B (Burkitt lymphoma of the appendix, hematoxylin and eosin). Lysis of cancer cells (Panel C) releases DNA, phosphate, potassium, and cytokines. DNA released from the lysed cells is metabolized into adenosine and guanosine, both of which are converted into xanthine. Xanthine is then oxidized by xanthine oxidase, leading to the production of uric acid, which is excreted by the kidneys. When the accumulation of phosphate, potassium, xanthine, or uric acid is more rapid than excretion, the tumor lysis syndrome develops. Cytokines cause hypotension, inflammation, and acute kidney injury, which increase the risk for the tumor lysis syndrome. The bidirectional dashed line between acute kidney injury and tumor lysis syndrome indicates that acute kidney injury increases the risk of the tumor lysis syndrome by reducing the ability of the kidneys to excrete uric acid, xanthine, phosphate, and potassium. By the same token, development of the tumor lysis syndrome can cause acute kidney injury by renal precipitation of uric acid, xanthine, and calcium phosphate crystals and by crystal independent mechanisms. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase (Panel D) and prevents the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine into uric acid, but does not remove existing uric acid. In contrast, rasburicase removes uric acid by enzymatically degrading it into allantoin, a highly soluble product that has no known adverse effects on health (Howard et al. 2011)",
