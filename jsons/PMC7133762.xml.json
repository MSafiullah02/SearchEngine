Additionally, the wide range of HCAI facilitators (e.g. procedures,4 environment5) and increasingly susceptible patients6 complicate transmission dynamics, making prospective identification and control exceedingly difficult. When multiple cases of an infection occur within a hospital, it is difficult to differentiate a true nosocomial transmission from unrelated cases, and cohorting patients by risk group may lead to assumptions of a common source but molecular analyses often demonstrate lack of transmission.7\n",

These methods can also be used to control for the effects of cohorting and other patient characteristics that may give the spurious impression of clustering or transmission when it has not occurred. This, in turn, would provide better information on where interventions could be targeted most effectively, and when or where to anticipate outbreaks. These methods may also be useful in more rapid identification of a problem, as even small clusters (e.g. two or three cases) can be detected. Even the introduction of more simplified analytical methods to evaluate spatial and temporal relationships could be beneficial. One example is the Knox test, which has been used widely to detect time\u2013space clusters since the 1960s. The null hypothesis in Knox testing would be that all HCAI cases are independent, and the test returns the number of pairs of cases that are deemed to cluster in time and/or space. The tool is simple to apply as it only requires information on cases, not controls or susceptible individuals, and can work on a minimal clinical dataset.8\n",

These are computer-based programs that combine cartography, statistical analysis and database technology to layer databases on top of a predefined map. They have been applied in a range of ecological investigations of disease,9 and to determine whether there is a spatial association between disease risk and environmental pollution. In this study, GIS and spatial analysis were employed to investigate the risk of breast and lung cancer in a small region.10 After identification of significant clusters, it was possible to identify local risk factors specific to each cancer type, providing evidence of potential environmental contamination. The use of similar techniques to create hospital maps, on which infection data can be displayed and analysed, could increase understanding of local transmission and risk,11 and provide rapid dissemination of information through visualization.12\n",

Frequently, investigations of HCAIs provide a basic epidemiological description of cases over time by providing an epidemic curve, or show how cases are distributed across wards using a diagram. However, hospital databases contain laboratory results, building management data and floor plans, and information on patient admissions and movement that could easily be incorporated into more detailed analyses to improve understanding of local HCAI epidemiology. Use of interdisciplinary tools may increase the ability to identify transmission prospectively and implement preventive measures.14\n",

Numerous studies combined spatiotemporal and molecular data to attempt to develop a better understanding of strain dissemination69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 or potential sources82, 83, 84, 85 within the institutions in which they were conducted. Integration of molecular and temporal data enabled investigators to highlight potential links between patients, and identify potential transmission events,86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 with greater substantiation than simple descriptive studies. In one study, researchers were able to differentiate between two consecutive outbreaks of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia on their intensive care unit by visualizing the temporal distribution of isolates identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)93; however, it is possible that these two distinct outbreaks could have encompassed several smaller events with the same RFLP type introduced multiple times.",

Nuebel et al. applied whole-genome sequencing of MRSA in a neonatal intensive care unit145 to compare accumulated sequence variation in the isolates, and used Bayesian skyline analysis to reveal epidemiological links between patients, healthcare workers and parents. They concluded that integration of epidemiological mapping and genomic data was necessary to understand MRSA transmission. Similarly, Gandhi et al. performed a retrospective study to investigate epidemiological links between extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in South Africa146 by combining RFLP analysis and social network data to build transmission networks among genotypically similar patients. Their findings showed that the epidemic was highly clonal, and network analysis indicated transmission across a network with high levels of interconnectedness. de Celles et al. tried to estimate the variability in transmission between different multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clonal groups147 using data on carriage on a surgical ward. They identified three clonal complexes by performing molecular fingerprinting, and applied stochastic transmission models to estimate transmission rates for each complex. Results suggested that one of the clones had enhanced transmissibility compared with the other two clones, and further explained local epidemic dynamics. Finally, Kumar et al.\n148 optimized cluster identification by organizing multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolates from admitted patients into co-resistance groups, and using schematics of the ward layouts in a Monte Carlo simulation. They concluded that this was \u2018a powerful way to quickly identify outbreaks\u2019, and early detection is critical with the decreasing number of effective treatment regimens available.",

Kruger and Steffen used GIS to undertake geostatistical analysis of local antibiotic resistance to act as an early warning system for the emergence of drug-resistant strains,150 enabling doctors to alter their prescription practices. Kho et al. developed and implemented GIS software that enabled them to demonstrate inappropriate patient placement and insufficient hand hygiene in 14% of healthcare provider\u2013patient contacts.151 Kwan et al. incorporated GIS successfully in a wide range of hospital-based investigations.12 Using GIS as the central repository for spatial and temporal data of infectious disease cases, the collected data were queried and analysed to identify disease clusters.
