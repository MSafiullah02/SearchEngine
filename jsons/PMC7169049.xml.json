Further investigation revealed that, though not yet proven, the presence of melamine and melamine\u2010related compounds, such as cyanuric acid, in the ingredients of the affected food appears to be the cause of kidney failure that killed thousands and sickened tens of thousands of pets. Meanwhile, on August 2, 2007, the toy\u2010making giant Mattel recalled 967,000 toys, including Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street toys, due to violations of lead paint standards,\n4\n which was followed by a rash of toy recalls in August and September 2007.(\n\n4\n\n) Children who suck on or ingest toys with high lead content may have elevated blood lead levels and may get lead poisoning. This can lead to learning and behavior problems, and at very high levels, seizures, coma, and even death (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)).\n5\n\n",

            "text": "We are interested in how consumers perceive the quality risk of a product under threat of recall and how they make a decision about actions to take upon hearing news of an actual or threatened product recall. Here, product quality risk refers to the risk of a product (e.g., health, financial, safety risk, etc.) caused to customers and generated by its inherent quality problems (e.g., in raw materials, ingredients, production, logistics, or packaging). We examine risk perceptions and decisions using the contaminated pet food and lead\u2010painted toys as examples in the same study for a number of reasons. First, pets and children are vulnerable members of a household that adults have a responsibility to protect.\n6\n Second, both involved potentially serious health threats. Third, the recalls occurred in the same time span. Finally, both products originated in China and were destined for the U.S. market. For these two recalls, there was a great deal of media attention, including anecdotal stories of relatively extreme actions by consumers. For instance, in response to the recall of lead\u2010painted toys, some parents were so concerned and scared that they tested all of their children's toys for lead and threw away the toys on the recall list.(\n\n7\n\n) For regulators, consumers, and the companies in the supply chain for these products, it will be valuable to understand the components of people's reactions to such events. This line of work should be helpful in future recalls of other products to gain a quick understanding of likely patterns of consumer reactions.",

            "text": "To explore risk perceptions of these two product recalls, we used two approaches that have been widely adopted in the risk perception literature. The first approach was to elicit judged probabilities of the adverse quality risk with respect to these two product recalls.(\n\n8\n, \n9\n\n) Specifically, we elicited judged probabilities that (1) a dog will die from eating contaminated dog food within the next month (in the case of the dog food recall) and (2) an under\u2010six\u2010year\u2010old child will have elevated blood lead levels from playing with lead\u2010painted toys within the next couple of months (in the case of the children's toys recall). We then examined biases in judged probabilities of quality risks of these two products due to using a packed frame (lumping together multiple items) or unpacked frame (listing items separately). We chose to investigate this since companies or regulators in future recall crises would have the ability to frame probability information and other messages using packed or unpacked probability frames. People tend to have an overall higher judged probability for a focal event's occurrence when the description of an event is unpacked into its individual components.(\n\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n\n) Also Tversky and Kahneman(\n\n17\n\n) showed that when a described specific case seems very representative of a general category, this \u201crepresentativeness\u201d may lead to higher judged probabilities. In this study, an adverse health effect from the recalled product may be incorrectly seen as more likely to occur than that same health effect from any cause.",

This approach has been widely adopted to understand and predict people's responses to various risks by identifying similarities and differences among those risks. Analyzing newly arising risks and comparing them with existing ones along a number of dimensions will help policymakers understand each new risk and potentially help the general public accurately perceive the risks. Accordingly, we considered eight hazardous products and risky situations, including the two recalled products and six additional risks spanning sickness risks from food\n7\n and nonfood consumer products,\n8\n on seven qualitative rating scales. The six comparison risks include avian flu (because it poses severe health risks to both birds and humans),(\n\n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n\n) mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which has raised consumer anxiety about beef consumption,(\n\n45\n, \n46\n, \n47\n\n) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), contaminated spinach, smoking cigarettes,(\n\n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n, \n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n\n) and cell phone radiation.

In survey version A, participants gave an estimate of the number of dogs dying from eating the food within the next month. For instance, if an estimate was 2,000, this participant's judged probability of dogs dying from eating the contaminated food was 20%= 2,000/10,000 (i.e., participants were told in the survey to suppose that 10,000 dogs ate the same contaminated dog food). A similar structure was used for toys. Thus, using version A, we elicited participants\u2019 subjective probabilities for the two scenarios and found that the mean judged probability of dogs dying from eating the contaminated food was 46.9% and the mean judged probability of children having higher blood lead levels from lead\u2010painted toys was 51.7%. We believe that our participants tended to overestimate their probability judgments for the potential adverse reactions with these two recalls.\n11\n This is very likely due to the availability heuristic,(\n\n17\n\n) which states that people predict the frequency and probability of an event by the extent to which occurrences of that event are easily \u201cavailable\u201d in memory.\n12\n Clearly, there was extensive media coverage on the two product recalls during the recall crisis and thus adverse examples could be readily brought to mind for respondents. Note that a similar pattern has also been observed in the prior literature on risk perception. For example, by using a large\u2010scale national survey, Viscusi(\n\n48\n\n) found that both smokers and nonsmokers significantly overestimated the lung cancer risk of cigarette smoking.",

In contrast, in version B, the general set of causes of the adverse event may not have been very available in people's imagination, and thus their estimates for the probability of the larger category of adverse events from all causes may have been lower, since it might have been harder to bring to mind other instances of the adverse event not from the recalls.",

By comparing responses between versions B and C, we examine biases in probabilities due to packing or unpacking of the focal event. For children's toys, we asked respondents to think about those under\u2010six\u2010year\u2010old children who played with the lead\u2010painted toys.

Prior literature suggested that differences in economic development or industrialization levels are an important factor in accounting for the country\u2010of\u2010origin effect, that is, the higher the level of economic development or industrialization, the more favorable is the perception of the quality of its workers, as well as the perceived quality of its products.(\n\n73\n, \n74\n, \n75\n, \n76\n, \n77\n\n) Despite the privileged tariff status set by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico appears to be losing its U.S. export marketing shares; whereas with its accession to the World Trade Organization, China has played a very important role in today's world economy, that is, China has become the world's third largest economy since 2007, behind only Japan and the United States (CNN News, January 15, 2009).

They have developed a Risk Communication Tool Kit and several case studies, including one on the Schwan's Salmonella crisis (\n89\n\n) and one on tainted strawberries.(\n\n90\n\n)\n",

Contaminated spinach was near dog food on the vertical axis at moderately unknown risk and spinach was a bit more dread than dog food on the horizontal axis. Mad cow disease was even more dread. For future recall events, an examination of where the new risk falls on these dimensions could aid in understanding how the public might react.",

Two approaches were used to explore risk perceptions of the product recalls. In the first approach, we elicited judged probabilities and found that people appear to have greatly overestimated the actual risks for both product scenarios. In the second approach, we applied the psychometric paradigm to examine risk perception dimensions among eight health risks. It was found that the contaminated dog food was most unknown, most new, but least dread. The lead\u2010painted toys were the third most unknown, third most new, and second least dread. Examining these results via factor analysis, we found that both contaminated dog food and lead\u2010painted toys were near each other and near contaminated spinach and cell phone radiation in the two\u2010factor space of the risk perception map, and had similar patterns to what prior research found for lead paint.",
