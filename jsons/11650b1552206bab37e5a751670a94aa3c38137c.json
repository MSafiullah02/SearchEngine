Due to the advancement in virology since the late 1980s, several key events in the viral life cycle have been well delineated and a number of molecular targets have been validated, culminating in the emergence of many new antiviral drugs in recent years. Inhibitors against enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, responsible for about half of the human common colds, are currently under active investigation. Agents targeted at either viral protein 1 (VP1), a relatively conserved capsid structure mediating viral adsorption/uncoating process, or 3C protease, which is highly conserved among different serotypes and essential for viral replication, are of great potential to become antipicornavirus drugs. \u00df",

The capsids of picornaviruses are composed of four structural viral proteins, namely, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The capsid contains 60 structural proteins arranged into an icosahedral lattice. 20, 21 The basic building block of the picornaviral capsid is the protomer, which contains one copy of each VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. The shell is formed by VP1, VP2, and VP3, VP4 lies on its inner surface. VP1, VP2, and VP3, though with no homology in sequence, form a common structure: the b-barrel jelly roll. The main structural difference between VP1, VP2, and VP3 is the loop that connects the b-strands and the N-and C-terminal sequences that extend from the bbarrel domain. 22 The amino acid sequences give each picornavirus its distinct antigenicity. The surface of the virion has a prominent star-shaped plateau at the fivefold axis of symmetry, surrounded by a deep depression (''canyon'').

Therefore, 3C protease is a potential target for drug discovery. In addition to the cleavage of viral polyprotein, it has been shown that 2A pro cleaves the host cell protein eIF4G. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Cleavage of eIF4G prevents eIF4F from recruiting 40S ribosomal subunits to capped mRNAs, because the cleavage releases the N-terminal domain of eIF4G which binds to eIF4F which in turn binds to the 5 0 cap of cellular mRNA. This event shuts off the translation of host cellular mRNA. The viral proteases 2A and 3C also contribute to poliovirus-induced apoptosis. [36] [37] [38] Poliovirus 2A induces apoptosis through the cleavage of translation initiation factor eIF4G, 36 whereas poliovirus 3C kills cells by apoptosis through the activation of caspase. 38, 39 Similar apoptotic pathways have also been demonstrated in enterovirus 71 (EV71). Transient expression of EV71 2A protease results in triggering apoptosis. 40 EV71 3C protease induces apoptosis in the human neural cells via the activation of caspase. 41 ",

The fever pattern may be biphasic. Symptoms and signs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, myalgia, rash, and muscle weakness. Aseptic meningitis caused by certain enterovirus serotypes is associated with particular clinical stigmata. Encephalitis due to enterovirus infection is also well documented. Unlike aseptic meningitis, enteroviral encephalitis may have more profound acute disease and long-term sequelae. 65 The illness usually begins like aseptic meningitis, with fever and other symptoms. Central nervous system (CNS) signs include confusion, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, and irritability. Coma or seizures may also occur. Enteroviral meningitis/encephalitis usually has a good prognosis. However, as mentioned previously, EV71 meningitis/encephalitis may accompany pulmonary edema and leads to fatality.

To date, at least 102 and 65 distinct serotypes, respectively, for human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses have been reported. In addition to numerous variants, the high-mutation rate during viral replication also presents a formidable challenge for the development of effective vaccines. For these reasons, effective antiviral drugs to treat diseases caused by infection of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses should not only possess high potency and low toxicity but have also a broad spectrum of activity.",

Over the past two decades, inhibiting viral attachment/uncoating by VP1 blockers and interrupting viral replication via targeting 3A coding region or 3C protease have all been attempted in order to find effective antipicornaviral agents. However, these efforts have met with little success up to this point. Despite the disappointing results, the capsid protein VP1 is considered the most promising therapeutic target due to the fact that pleconaril, a drug candidate of the Win series with potential use in fighting cold, has reached a very advanced stage (Phase III-IV) in its clinical trials. Although pleconaril was finally rejected because of safety concerns, it is believed that the underlying cause of the adverse side effects is structure-based rather than target-based in nature. The remaining sections of this review will focus on the current efforts in developing small-molecule antiviral agents, with a particular emphasis on chemical structures exerting biological activities on either VP1 capsid protein or 3C protease.",

The binding site for capsid-binding compounds appears to be a hydrophobic pocket inside VP1 located under the canyon floor. Between the floor and pocket is a section containing the GH loop, a region displaying the greatest changes in viral structure induced by compound binding. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain how capsid binders mediate antiviral functions mentioned above. In terms of uncoating, insertion of a compound into the VP1 hydrophobic pocket leads to an increase in the stability of the viral particle, rendering the virus more resistant to uncoating, a process necessary for the release of viral RNA. It is believed that uncoating of viral particle requires certain degree of capsid flexibility. Interaction with capsid binders may produce a more compacted capsid structure with limited vacant space for conformational changes essential for uncoating to take place. As for attachment, binding of inhibitors to the VP1 pocket may induce a conformational change in the viral canyon floor, the binding site of cellular receptors such as ICAM-1 molecule identified as the major rhinovirus receptor, and thus prevent adsorption of the viruses to the host cells.",

            "text": "Among capsid-binding compounds, the Win series of compounds in Figure 2 play a remarkable role in the development of antiviral agents against both rhino-and entero-viral infections. Disoxaril, also known as Win 51711, was the first compound of this family with satisfactory biological profiles to enter the clinical trial. This compound was found to be effective in vitro against most rhino-and enteroviral serotypes tested. [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] It also showed oral efficacy in preventing poliovirus-2 and echovirus-9 induced paralysis in mice. However, its clinical studies were discontinued due to the appearance of crystallurea in healthy volunteers at high dosage. A successor, Win 54954, was subsequently evaluated in Phase II for in vivo efficacy against two rhinoviruses (RV 23 and 39) and one enterovirus (coxsackievirus A21). [80] [81] [82] The compound significantly attenuated viral titers and the severity of colds induced by coxsackievirus A21 but failed to show any efficacy against either rinhovirus. Win 54954 had a very short half-life, presumably due to the acid lability of the oxazoline ring, and was not further developed for clinical use owing to adverse effects of flushing and rash. Attempts were then made to discover more hydrolytically stable analogues with comparable antiviral potency. These studies led to the discovery of a series of 2-methyltetrazole compounds which are not only resistant to acidic conditions but maintain a broad spectrum of activity. 80, 83 Win 61605, regarded as the most promising candidate in the series, was selected for the treatment of rhino-and entero-viral infections. Unfortunately, when administered orally to beagles, this molecule caused hepatotoxic side effects. The hepatotoxicity is presumbably due to the multiple nitrogen tetrazole ring or its metabolic product(s). As a result, Win 61605 was dropped for further evaluation. In continuation of the search for structurally related bioisosteric molecules with reduced hepatotoxicity, Win 63843, also referred to as pleconaril, finally emerged as a promising new drug candidate for the treatment of human enteroviral infections. [84] [85] [86] In addition to a better metabolic stability in the monkey liver microsomal assay, the newly developed 5-methyl-oxadiazole analogue has also been shown to be more potent than its oxazoline (Win 54954) and tetrazole (Win 61605) predecessors against a variety of rhino-and entero-viruses. Pleconaril can be given by oral administration and is currently being developed by ViroPharma for the treatment of diseases associated with picornavirus infections. This drug candidate is in its late-stage clinical trials for treating viral respiratory infections and viral meningitis. Unfortunately, even though pleconaril was demonstrated to be effective in shortening the number of days patients felt sick and reducing the severity of symptoms, it was not approved by FDA for marketing due to safety concerns, making the drug's fate uncertain. Considering the tremendous synthetic efforts made as well as the two decades consumed on the development of the Win compounds, this unexpected result is extremely discouraging.",

Cytotoxicity of BTA-188 was detected only at much higher concentrations and in toxicopharmacokinectic studies. The high-oral bioavailability, 62-64% in rats and 21-28% in dogs, suggests that BTA-188 can be administered orally. Replacement of the oxime-substituted phenyl ring with various bicyclic heterocyclic rings led to another series of compounds, as represented by Biota Benzazole 15 (Fig. 3) , with significant activity against HRV-2 and HRV-14 even at concentrations as low as 0.006 mg/mL (IC 50 ). 91, 92 Further evaluation of these two classes are ongoing and the results have not been disclosed.",

These studies resulted in the development of a series of imidazolidinone derivatives, such as BPR0Z 112 and 284 shown in 93, 94 The antiviral activity for EV 71 makes this series extremely significant and useful for developing potential anti-EV 71 agents. In 1998, many children in Taiwan fell victim to HFMD, aseptic meningitis/encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, resulting in about 80 fatalities; EV71 was identified as a major pathogen in the etiology of these cases. Young children appear to be more susceptible to EV71 virus infection, also after infection with more severe symptoms. Unfortunately, after 1998 epidemic outbreak, EV71 has been continually isolated through the whole island all year round, and many severe cases caused by EV71 have also been reported. Pleconaril, claimed to possess broad-spectrum activity against enteroviruses, was tested for its antiviral activity against EV71. However, Pleconaril failed to neutralize the cytopathic effect (CPE) of cultured cells induced by EV71 isolated from the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan. This finding underscores the necessity of developing antiviral agents using materials isolated from local strains. Time-course studies showed that imidazolidinones effectively inhibited the early stages of EV71 viral infection, suggesting that the surface protein VP1 is highly likely to be the molecular target for this type of compounds. Currently, this class of compounds is under active investigation to evaluate their potential in therapeutic utility.",

When administered orally (60 mg/kg, three times per day), SCH 38057 protected mice infected with either cox B3 or echo 9 from mortality for 21 days. The subsequent SCH 47802 and its derivatives SCH 48972, 48974, 49860, 49861, and 48973 (Fig. 5) exhibited potent activity against a panel of enteroviruses, including polio 2, echo 3-7, 11, and 30, cox A9, B1-3, and B5, at concentrations (IC 50 ) ranging from 0.02 to 10 mg/mL in plaque reduction assays. Cytotoxicity assays conducted on HeLa and RD cells showed that their IC 50 values were all over 50 mg/mL. SCH 47802, administered orally, protected mice with polio 2-induced encephalitis from mortality at day 21 with survival rates 57, 47, and 66% at a dose of 60, 90, and 120 mg/kg/day, respectively; its closely related analogue SCH 48973 also showed an increase in Pirodavir (R 77975) and its predecessor (R 61837), as shown in Figure 6 , were discovered at Janssen Research Foundation. Both compounds possessed significant activity in inhibiting the replication of many rhinovirus serotypes. [98] [99] [100] Compared to R 61837, pirodavir showed an improvement in potency by more than 500-fold in vitro and inhibited about 80% of rhinoviral serotypes at concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL or less. When the nasal sprays were given six times a day for 5 days to the patients, significant reductions in virus shedding occurred but no clinical benefits were observed. The lack of clinical efficacy of pirodavir could be due to the low-water solubility of this series, making it difficult to administer in an aqueous formulation compatible with respiratory secretion, and/or the labile ester functional group prone to rapid hydrolysis to form the corresponding inactive acid. Although R 61837 is much less active against most rhinovirus serotypes relative to R 77975, when given prophylactically, it was found to be effective in preventing colds in human volunteers challenged with rhinovirus 9. Given by intranasal spray sixtimes a day for 4 consecutive days (total dose, 25 mg) commencing 28 hr before virus challenge, R 61837 was able to suppress symptoms until 48 hr after medication ceased. In these studies, both compounds were formulated with 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin to enhance their water solubility.",

            "text": "Independently, a class of compounds which shared the common piperazine-ring motif with R 61837 was discovered at Sandoz Forschungsinstitut. [101] [102] [103] As typified by SDZ 35682 and 880061 in Figure 7 , these novel piperazine-containing derivatives are potent and selective inhibitors against a series of human rhinovirus serotypes and some enteroviruses in vitro. The former (SDZ 35682) is active against rhinovirus serotypes such as HRV 14, 26, 35, 37, 43, and 48 with IC 50 less than 0.1 mg/ mL and echovirus 9 with IC 50 value of 0.3 mg/mL; the latter (SDZ 880061) is more selective towards human rhinoviruses with a relatively broader antiviral spectrum. Of the 89 HRV serotypes tested, SDZ 880061 inhibited 31 in 89 with IC 50 values equal to or lower than 0.0003 mg/mL and 76 in 89 with IC 50 lower than 3 mg/mL. Similar to the R series, SDZ 35682 and 880061 are also typical capsid-binding molecules, the evidence of which was individually substantiated by their co-crystallization with HRV 14. 102,103 A considerable conformational change at VP1 binding site was observed in the HRV 14/ SDZ 35682 complex in which SDZ 35682, a compound of 19 \u00c5 in length, fills the entire VP1 hydrophobic pocket including the innermost end and occupies the space more efficiently than other long antiviral agents such as Win 51711. It has been suggested that compounds fitting into the entire pocket might affect the uncoating process of the viral particles. SDZ 880061 was also found to bind at the same pocket in its HRV 14 complex structure. However, the innermost portion of the pocket is vacant, causing less alteration of the VP1 backbone conformation compared to other antiviral agents analyzed structurally. As a result, SDZ880061 only has marginal effects on viral uncoating. This may provide an explanation for the observation that, in the time-course studies, SDZ 880061 was found to primarily interfere with the HRV 14 adsorption to the cell instead of inhibiting viral uncoating. Both of these compounds showed no detectable cytotoxic effect up to 30 mg/mL. SDZ35682 at a dose of 126 mg/kg reduced echovirus 9-induced paralysis and shortened the mean time of paralysis by 70% in mice. Greater than 85% protection from Echovirus 9-induced death can be achieved by either a low dose (71 mg/kg) given for 6 days or a high dose (126 mg/kg) administered for 2 days. Although SDZ 35682 showed antiviral efficacy in mice, its clinical usefulness may be limited due to a narrow antiviral spectrum. As for SDZ 880061, its in vivo studies are not available.",

            "text": "Some capsid function inhibitors are synthetic derivatives or analogues based on the core structures of naturally occurring products. Rhodanine (Fig. 8) , 2-thio-4-oxothiazolidine, was synthesized and evaluated in various biological systems in the 1970s. 104, 105 The results revealed that the spectrum of the virus inhibitory activity of rhodanine was extremely narrow. At a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL, only selective inhibition against echovirus 12 was observed. However, it is non-toxic to the uninfected host cells (monkey kidney cells) at a concentration up to 150 mg/mL. Several derivatives and analogues of rhodanine were prepared and tested (Fig. 8) , but they were all considerably less potent than rhodanine itself. 104 4 0 ,6-Dichloroflavan (BW 683C) as illustrated in Figure 9 with a flavanoid-like skeleton is highly effective against some of the most prevalent rhinoviral serotypes (1A, 1B, 2, 15, 29, and 31) , with in vitro IC 50 values between 0.007 and 0.17 mM/mL. 106 Mechanistic studies indicated that BW683C blocked viral replication by inhibiting a stage immediately after the entrance of the viral RNA into host cells. In order to improve the potency as well as to broaden the antiviral spectrum, synthetic flavanoids substituted with halo, cyano, and amidino groups were prepared and tested for their in vitro activity against HRV 1B, polio 2, cox B4, echo 6, and EV71. [107] [108] [109] Among the synthetic flavanoids tested (e.g., compounds 1-4 shown in Fig. 9 ), 4 0 -chloro-6-cyanoflavan (3) was found to be not only more active against HRV 1B infection than parental BW 683C, but also showed good antienteroviral activity within micro and submicromolar range (IC 50 \u00bc 0.32-1.28 mM). In contrast, BW 863C was inactive for most of the enteroviruses tested with the exception of cox B4 for which moderate activity was observed ($2.6 mM). Among the compounds listed in Figure 9 , compound 3 exhibited the most potent activity against EV71 (IC 50 \u00bc 0.45 mM). However, relative to those EV71-specific imidazolidinones (Fig. 4 ) discovered at NHRI (Taiwan), this compound is much shorter in length with a decrease in activity by tenfold. The higher potency observed for the imidazolidinones could be attributed to their more efficient occupation of the VP1 pocket to produce structurally more stable virions.",

Ro 09-0410 was found to be ineffective against rhinovirus infections in human volunteers, probably because of its poor water solubility and oral bioavailability. Studies on various analogues related to this antirhinovirus agent led to the identification of a novel class of chalcone amide analogues 112 (e.g., 09-0696, 09-0881 in Fig. 10) which, compared to Ro 09-0410, were 4.5-to 10-fold more active against 12 selected HRV serotypes at concentrations as low as 2-3 ng/mL and showed very low cytotoxicity (30-50 mg/mL). Labeling studies indicated that these amide compounds competitively inhibited the binding of Ro 09-0410 [ 3 H] to the viral capsid site in a manner similar to BW 863C, VP 63843, and WIN 51711. No clinical information is available for this series of compounds. The mode of action of above-mentioned capsid-binding molecules has been experimentally verified with evidence indicating that the inhibition of viral replication occurred at the early stages during viral attachment and/or uncoating. Some compounds, while their mechanisms have not been studied or reported, are also likely to function as capsid-binding molecules in light of their linear structural profiles as well as lipophilic properties. For example, a novel class of azolyalkyloxy compounds synthesized by Synphar Laboratories, Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is believed to mimic Win 51711 (disoxaril). 113 The active compounds of this series, as typified with 3methylisoxazole and 4-methylthiazole derivatives in Figure 11 , showed in vitro activity against 33-40 of a panel of 52 rhinovirus serotypes with IC 50 values ranging from 0.5 to 25 mg/mL. Some of them also showed moderate activity (IC 50 \u00bc 1-25 mg/mL) against 5 to 6 serotypes of 7 enteroviruses tested. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship studies revealed that, like most of Win compounds, the optimal length of the alkyl chain between two terminal heterocyclic moieties of this series is either 6 or 7 methylene units.",

The first two classes, diaryl methanes and arakylaminopyridines, were developed by Kenny et al. 114 Among these 26 compounds evaluated against rhinoviruses 1A, 2, and 64 as well as coxsackievires 21, several were found to exhibit moderate activity with IC 50 ranging from 0.3 to 5 mg/ mL. Based on these observations, diaryl methane 6 and arakylaminopyridine 7 (Fig. 12) were selected for further testing against a larger panel of picornaviruses and their in vivo antiviral efficacy. Both compounds exhibited similar in vitro activity, inhibiting 12-15 of the 23 picornaviruses tested at concentrations less than 5 mg/mL. In addition, the arakylaminopyridine was found to be more active in vivo in protecting cox A21-infected mice at a single oral dose of 37.5 mg/kg or at a continuous oral dose of 18.8 mg/mL per day. With these observed in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy, their potential clinical application to the treatment of picornavirus infection diseases appears to be limited. As for 2-(4-pyridylaminomethyl)benzimidazole analogues, 115 their in vitro activities against polio 2, cox B4, HRV 14 , and enterovirus 70 were tested, showing that these analogues are particularly effective against enterovirus 70 with IC 50 values as low as 0.52 mg/mL. Cytotoxicity evaluation using LLC-MK 2 and HaLa cells indicated that this series of compounds is not toxic up to concentrations more than 100 mg/mL (CC 50 ). Representative compounds 9 and 10 ( Fig. 13 ) prevented the development of Cox B4-induced hypoglycermia in mice for 2-4 days after infection when given intraperitoneally (i.p.) with an initial dose of 40 mg/kg/day followed by 80 mg/kg/day for 3 days.

Therapeutically useful antiviral drugs should have broad antiviral spectrum, high potency, and low cytotoxicity. Therefore, molecules acting at the viral VP1 pocket, where only a subtle difference in the size is observed for various serotypes in the same genus or even for different genera, could be promising therapeutic agents for treating picornaviral infection.",

However, the majority of these compounds, as shown in the previous section, bind to the viral capsid and inhibit either viral attachment/adsorption or subsequent uncoating. In addition to agents that interfere with the early stage in the picornaviral life cycle, attempts have been made recently to develop inhibitors to block the virus-coded 2A or 3C proteases at the synthetic stage of the virus replication. Antipicornaviral agents designed to target the 3C protease, which is highly conserved among different viral serotypes, have exhibited great potential in therapeutic utility. Since peptide aldehydes have been successfully used as inhibitors for cysteine and serine proteases and were shown to form reversible covalent adduct, the modified tripeptide aldehydes were designed and synthesized as inhibitors for HRV 3CP. 117 Molecular models based on the apo crystal structure of HRV-14 3CP and other trypsin-like serine proteases were constructed to approximate the binding of peptide substrate, generating transition state models of P 1 -P 1 0 amide cleavage. Since glutaminal derivatives exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiaminal form, several isosteric replacements for P 1 carboxamide side chain were designed and incorporated into the tripeptide aldehydes. The synthesized compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of purified HRV-14 3CP with K i s ranging from 0.005 to 0.65 mM. As shown in Table III , these compounds have low Table V .

AG-7088 was tested for its antiviral activity and ability to inhibit the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B. 125 Infection of BEAS-2B cells with HRV-14 resulted in the production of both infectious virus and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment of HRV-14 infected cells with AG-7088 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of infectious virus as well as a reduced IL-6 and IL-8 level in the cell supernatant. AG-7088 was able to inhibit the replication of the virus in BEAS-2B cells. 126 In order to have more favorable pharmacokinetic properties and to develop orally available 3CP inhibitors, certain substituted benzamides as non-peptide inhibitors of HRV 3CP were invented. 127 a, b-Unsaturated keto benzamides (Table IX) showed good inhibitory property and moderate activity; yet 5-substituted benzamides (Table X) were found to be more active.",

Molecular modeling using the apo crystal structure of HRV-14 3CP and a peptide substrate model provided the design template for building recognition features into P 1 and P 2 subsites, respectively, from 5-to 1-positions of isatin. The synthesized compounds (see Table XI ) were found to possess excellent inhibitory properties toward HRV-14 3CP compared to other proteolytic enzymes, including chymotrypsin and cathepsin B.",

Protease inhibitors including saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir are available for treating diseases caused by HIV, a species of retroviruses. Antipicornavirus compounds targeting 3C protease are currently under active investigation. Among them, AG-7088, a potential treatment against rhinovirus causing the common cold, is now in Phase II clinical trial. Most recently, AG-7088 has shown to exhibit moderate in vitro activity against the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Modeling studies 130 also indicate that AG-7088 is a promising starting point in the search for a treatment for SARS via targeting 3CL protease, the main protease controlling the coronavirus replication.",
