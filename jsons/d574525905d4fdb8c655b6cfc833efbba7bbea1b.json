Limited availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular N95 respirators, has fueled concerns about whether HCWs are adequately protected from exposure while caring for patients. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a HCW -the community or the healthcare system -is critical for understanding the effectiveness of hospital infection control and PPE practices. In Dane County, Wisconsin, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low (cumulative prevalence of ~0.06% -positive cases / total population in Dane county as of April 17). Although SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs are often presumed to be acquired during the course of patient care, there are few reports unambiguously identifying the source of acquisition.",

Four days after providing care for these patients, the HCW began experiencing headache, fever, and sore throat. A nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was obtained and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. To establish the most likely source of infection, we interviewed the HCW's family member (HCW-F), who had developed a febrile illness eight days before onset of symptoms in the HCW, but was not tested initially due to limited testing availability.",
