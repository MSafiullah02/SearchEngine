Five years ago the UN member states extended the definition of risk to include biological hazards, adopting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, driven by countries that had experienced disease epidemics from strains of Ebola, MARS, and SARS. One of the framework's seven global targets is to substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments by 2030. Yet across recent documents -the WHO's 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (2020) [3] , the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board report A World at Risk (2019) [4] , the International Working Group on Financing Preparedness' report From Panic and Neglect to Investing in Health Security (2017) [5] , and the International Health Regulations' The Joint External Evaluation Tool (2016) [6] -the term 'warning' is only mentioned twice.",

By contrast, throughout the 1990s and 2000s the UN held a number of EWS conferences on natural hazards resulting in a number of publications [7, 8] . Following the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami the UN called for the development of a global EWS for all types of natural hazards for all communities. Thieren [9] argues that if an EWS were in place when the tsunami struck the Indian Ocean region, an estimated 230,000 deaths in eleven countries could have been prevented. In March 2005, the UN ISDR Platform for the Promotion of Early Warning (PPEW) undertook a global survey to identify existing capacities and gaps in EWS research, comprising of EWS conferences conducted in over 23 countries with 20 international agencies (UN ISDR PPEW, 2006) and culminating in the report Global Survey of Early Warning Systems [10] . The report advocated that EWS should comprise of diverse activities spanning four key elements: risk knowledge, monitoring and warning service, dissemination and communication, and response capability.",

Of particular note is the New Zealand COVID-19 Alert Level System [11] . New Zealand is relatively well prepared for natural hazards with numerous alert level systems in place for volcanoes, tsunami, and weather hazards. A similar set of protocols underpins its COVID-19 alert system. This comprises four colour-coded alert levels -prepare, reduce, restrict, and lockdown -providing clear guidance on the risk assessment, and the range of measures in place. Each alert level has specific outcomes, summaries, and measures for public health, personal movement, travel and transport, gatherings, public venues, health and disability care services, workplace, and education so that there is clarity in what can and cannot be conducted at each alert level. The guidance provided can be updated based on new scientific information, or the effectiveness of control measures (both in New Zealand, and overseas), but this new information will be subsumed into the existing EWS. New Zealand successfully transitioned to Alert Level 3 'Restrict' on Monday 27 th April for a minimum of two weeks [12] , and an evaluation of the cases of COVID-19 will provide insights into the success of the measures in place and the effectiveness of this system.",

            "text": "On 24 th April, members of the Welsh government stated they wanted to implement a traffic light system following initial lockdown [13] . Red, amber, and green are commonly adopted in EWS designs for natural hazards due to their ease of understanding, but do constrain the number of levels to 3. Following this, the UK announced its COVID-19 Alert Levels on 10th May, also adopting a traffic light system; this is closely linked to the UK Terrorism Threat Levels [14] . Other countries are considering copying New Zealand's epidemic EWS, with key commentators in the USA also advocating for a warning system based on their colourcoded Homeland Security Model. Andy Slavitt, for example, the former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services appointed by President Obama, argues: \"We're going to need to find a way to communicate [threats and appropriate behaviors] as they come and go, and we need a national standard\" and that the US needs to \"develop a color coded system like we did after 9-11 to indicate safety levels and restrictions while we get to a vaccine\" [15] . Whilst a vaccine-based solution that can lessen the spread of the disease is vital, this will take time, and future waves need to be managed effectively over potentially long time scales. Building a warning system to address these needs requires bringing together expertise from all areas of disaster management, beyond the fields of epidemiologists and mathematicians, so to establish and manage effective EWS for the government bodies that will use it to trigger protocols. In our interconnected world, pandemic EWS, moreover, will be needed beyond the current COVID-19 crisis.",
