SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spread along the routes of international air travel and infection was carried to many places [1]. Khan et al. [2] pointed out a correlation between inter-regional spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus and travelers. From these observations a number of authors have proposed epidemic models describing disease transmission dynamics among multiple locations due to the population dispersal (see [3], [4], [5], [6] and the references therein).",

            "text": "Cui et al. [7] have proposed an epidemic model which models a phenomenon where individuals in a population suffer from diseases and possibly become infected during the movement between two regions. The model is given as a system of ordinary differential equations based on an SIS epidemic model. Takeuchi et al. [8] analyzed local and global stability of equilibria as well as uniform persistence of the system. They found that there is a possibility of endemic situation due to the transport-related infection. However, as pointed out by Liu et al. [9] the epidemic models proposed in [7], [10], [8] implicitly assumed that the transportation between two regions occurs instantaneously. This motivated Liu et al. [9] to rigorously describe the disease transmission dynamics during the transportation by introducing the time needed to complete the use of the transportation. They assumed that it takes \u03c4 units of time to complete one-way transport between two regions. They obtained the following delay differential equations: (1.1){dS1(t)dt=A\u2212dS1(t)\u2212\u03b2S1(t)I1(t)S1(t)+I1(t)+\u03b4I1(t)\u2212\u03b1S1(t)+s21(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4),dI1(t)dt=\u03b2S1(t)I1(t)S1(t)+I1(t)+i21(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(d+\u03b4+\u03b1)I1(t),dS2(t)dt=A\u2212dS2(t)\u2212\u03b2S2(t)I2(t)S2(t)+I2(t)+\u03b4I2(t)\u2212\u03b1S2(t)+s12(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4),dI2(t)dt=\u03b2S2(t)I2(t)S2(t)+I2(t)+i12(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)\u2212(d+\u03b4+\u03b1)I2(t), with s21(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S2(t\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S2(t\u2212\u03c4)+I2(t\u2212\u03c4)(S2(t\u2212\u03c4)+I2(t\u2212\u03c4)),i21(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1I2(t\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S2(t\u2212\u03c4)+I2(t\u2212\u03c4)(S2(t\u2212\u03c4)+I2(t\u2212\u03c4)),s12(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S1(t\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S1(t\u2212\u03c4)+I1(t\u2212\u03c4)(S1(t\u2212\u03c4)+I1(t\u2212\u03c4)),i12(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1I1(t\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212\u03b3\u03c4S1(t\u2212\u03c4)+I1(t\u2212\u03c4)(S1(t\u2212\u03c4)+I1(t\u2212\u03c4)). Here Sj(t) and Ij(t) denote the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals at time t in region j, respectively, where j\u2208{1,2}. A is the total number of newborns per unit time, d is the natural death rate and \u03b4 is the recovery rate. Disease is transmitted by \u03b2SjIj/(Sj+Ij), where \u03b2 is the disease transmission coefficient in each region. Susceptible and infected individuals leave a region towards another region at a per capita rate \u03b1. Thus the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals leaving region j per unit time are given by \u03b1Sj(t) and \u03b1Ij(t), respectively. skj(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4) and ikj(\u03c4,t\u2212\u03c4) for j,k\u2208{1,2} and j\u2260k denote the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals arriving in region j from region k per unit time at time t. They leave region j at time t\u2212\u03c4 and spend \u03c4 units of time in transportation, where disease transmission occurs. We denote by \u03b3 the transmission coefficient in the transportation.

We denote by skj(\u03b8,t) and ikj(\u03b8,t) the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals leaving region k per unit time at time t and spend \u03b8 units of time in transportation to region j, where \u03b8\u2208[0,\u03c4]. Then considering the number of susceptible and infected individuals leaving region k to j per unit time at time t\u2212\u03c4 we obtain that (1.2)skj(0,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1Sk(t\u2212\u03c4)andikj(0,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b1Ik(t\u2212\u03c4). We assume that the individuals in the population do not die in the transportation. Then the disease dynamics in the transportation from region k to j can be described as \u2202\u2202\u03b8skj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u2212\u03b3ikj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)ikj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)+skj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)skj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4),\u2202\u2202\u03b8ikj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)=\u03b3ikj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)ikj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)+skj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4)skj(\u03b8,t\u2212\u03c4), where \u03b3 is the transmission coefficient in the transportation.

Consider the following functional defined on GN: (2.3)L(N1,N2)=\u2211j=12g(Nj(t)N\u2217)+\u03b1\u2211j=12\u222bt\u2212\u03c4tg(Nj(s)N\u2217)ds, where g(x)=x\u22121\u2212lnxfor x\u2208(0,+\u221e) and Nj(t),j=1,2, is any solution of (2.2). It is clear that L is continuous on GN and that for any (\u03d5,\u03c8)\u2208\u2202GN (the boundary of GN), the limit l(\u03d5,\u03c8)=lim(\u03a6,\u03a8)\u2192(\u03d5,\u03c8)\u2208\u2202GN,L(\u03a6,\u03a8),(\u03a6,\u03a8)\u2208GN, exists or is +\u221e. We consider the time derivative of L(N1,N2) along the solution of (2.2).First of all, we see that ddt[g(Nj(t)N\u2217)]=1N\u2217(1\u2212N\u2217Nj(t)){A\u2212(d+\u03b1)Nj(t)+\u03b1Nk(t\u2212\u03c4)}. Then, from A=(d+\u03b1)N\u2217\u2212\u03b1N\u2217, it follows that ddt[g(Nj(t)N\u2217)]=(d+\u03b1)(1\u2212N\u2217Nj(t))(1\u2212Nj(t)Nj\u2217)+\u03b1(1\u2212N\u2217Nj(t))(Nk(t\u2212\u03c4)N\u2217\u22121)=(d+\u03b1)(2\u2212Nj(t)Nj\u2217\u2212N\u2217Nj(t))+\u03b1(Nk(t\u2212\u03c4)N\u2217\u22121\u2212Nk(t\u2212\u03c4)Nj(t)+N\u2217Nj(t)). It follows that ddt\u222bt\u2212\u03c4tg(Nj(s)N\u2217)ds=g(Nj(t)N\u2217)\u2212g(Nj(t\u2212\u03c4)N\u2217)=Nj(t)N\u2217\u2212ln(Nj(t)N\u2217)\u2212Nj(t\u2212\u03c4)N\u2217+ln(Nj(t\u2212\u03c4)N\u2217). Therefore, we obtain that L\u02d9(2.2)(N1,N2)=\u2211j=12{(d+\u03b1)(2\u2212Nj(t)N\u2217\u2212N\u2217Nj(t))+\u03b1(\u22122+Nj(t)N\u2217+N\u2217Nj(t))}+\u03b1{(\u2212N2(t\u2212\u03c4)N1(t)+1+lnN2(t\u2212\u03c4)N1(t))+(\u2212N1(t\u2212\u03c4)N2(t)+1+lnN1(t\u2212\u03c4)N2(t))}=d\u2211j=12(2\u2212Nj(t)N\u2217\u2212N\u2217Nj(t))\u2212\u03b1{g(N2(t\u2212\u03c4)N1(t))+g(N1(t\u2212\u03c4)N2(t))}. Hence we obtain that (2.4)L\u02d9(2.2)(N1,N2)\u22640. From (2.3), (2.4), the positive equilibrium is stable.Let us define that E\u2254{(\u03d5,\u03c8)\u2208G\u00afN|l(\u03d5,\u03c8)<+\u221e,L\u02d9(2.2)(\u03d5,\u03c8)=0} and that M is the largest subset in E that is invariant with respect to (2.2). Then, we see that E={(\u03d5,\u03c8)\u2208G\u00afN|\u03d5(0)=\u03d5(\u2212\u03c4)=\u03c8(0)=\u03c8(\u2212\u03c4)=N\u2217}. Consider any initial function (\u03d5,\u03c8)\u2208M. Then it holds that (N1t,N2t)\u2208M\u2282E, where N1t(\u03b8)=N1(t+\u03b8) and N2t(\u03b8)=N2(t+\u03b8) through (0,\u03d5,\u03c8). Hence, M={(N\u2217,N\u2217)}. By an extension of LaSalle\u2019s invariance principle [12, Lemma 3.1], any solution tends to M (see also [13], [14]). Hence, the positive equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.  \u25a1\n",

We compute C(t) as follows: C(t)=\u2211j,k\u2208{1,2}j\u2260k(G(Ik(t))G(I\u2217)\u2212Ij(t)I\u2217\u2212I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217)+1)+\u2211j=12{\u2212ln(G(Ij(t))G(I\u2217))+ln(G(Ij(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217))}=\u2211j,k\u2208{1,2}j\u2260k(G(Ik(t))G(I\u2217)\u2212Ij(t)I\u2217\u2212I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217)+1)+\u2211j,k\u2208{1,2}j\u2260k{\u2212ln(G(Ij(t))G(I\u2217))+ln(Ij(t)I\u2217)+ln(I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(Ik\u2217))}=\u2211j=12{(G(Ij(t))G(I\u2217)\u22121\u2212ln(G(Ij(t))G(I\u2217)))\u2212(Ij(t)I\u2217\u22121\u2212ln(Ij(t)I\u2217))}+\u2211j,k\u2208{1,2}j\u2260k(\u2212I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217)+1+ln(I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217)))=\u2211j=12{g(G(Ij(t))G(I\u2217))\u2212g(Ij(t)I\u2217)}\u2212\u2211j,k\u2208{1,2}j\u2260kg(I\u2217Ij(t)G(Ik(t\u2212\u03c4))G(I\u2217)). Then, from (2.7) in Lemma 2.4, we see that C(t,\u03c4)\u22640. Therefore, we obtain U\u02d9(2.10)(I1,I2)\u22640, from (2.12).Let us define that E={(\u03d52,\u03c82)\u2208G\u00af|l(\u03d52,\u03c82)<+\u221e,U\u02d9(2.10)(I1,I2)=0} and that M is the largest subset in E that is invariant with respect to (2.8). Then, we see that E={(\u03d52,\u03c82)\u2208G\u00af|\u03d52(0)=\u03c82(0)=\u03d52(\u2212\u03c4)=\u03c82(\u2212\u03c4)=I\u2217}. Consider any initial function (\u03d52,\u03c82)\u2208M. Then it holds that (I1t,I2t)\u2208M\u2282E, where Ijt(\u03b8)=Ij(t+\u03b8),j=1,2 through (0,\u03d5,\u03c8). Hence, M={(I\u2217,I\u2217)}. By an extension of LaSalle\u2019s invariance principle [12, Lemma 3.1], any solution tends to M (see also [13], [14]) and hence, the positive equilibrium (I\u2217,I\u2217) of (2.5) is globally asymptotically stable.  \u25a1\n",

Constructing a Lyapunov functional and using LaSalle\u2019s invariance principle for the reduced system, we prove that the positive equilibrium of (2.5) is globally asymptotically stable if R0>1 (Theorem 2.6). This implies that the endemic equilibrium of (1.1) is also globally asymptotically stable if R0>1. The mathematical result suggests that, when the disease is endemic, in a situation where two regions are connected to each other by transportation, the endemic steady state is globally asymptotically stable regardless of the length of the travel time. However, one can see that in (1.1) it is assumed that the two regions share an identical parameter set. It may be necessary to consider two different population sizes and different dispersal rates in order to discuss precisely the impact of the transport-related infection on the disease dynamics. We leave this to future work.",
