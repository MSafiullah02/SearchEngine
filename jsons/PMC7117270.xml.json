Apoptosis can be triggered by diverse intracellular and extracellular signals, including virus infections. Many viruses have the ability to induce apoptosis, which is one of the cytolytic properties of viral infections, and show the phenotype of cytopathic effect (CPE) in vitro; this is particularly observed in RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae (Collins, 2001, Eleouet et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2001, Liu et al., 2006, Liu and Zhang, 2007, Ruggieri et al., 2007).",

Coronaviruses are classified into three groups (I\u2013III) based on serological cross-reactivity and phylogenetic analysis (Gonzalez et al., 2003). Equine coronavirus (ECoV) was first identified in the feces of a diarrheic foal. When the amino acid and genome sequences of ECoV were compared with those of other avian and mammalian coronaviruses, ECoV was found to be relatively similar to group II coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and particularly to bovine coronaviruses (BCoVs) (Guy et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 2007).

In a study on group II coronaviruses, MHV-3-infected macrophages from BALB/c mice showed syncytium formation and apoptosis, but the cell populations that showed the 2 phenomena were different (Belyavsky et al., 1998). In contrast, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-infected Vero cells showed syncytium formation followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis (Liu et al., 2001). These findings indicate that since IBV belongs to group III coronaviruses, ECoV and IBV are considerably separated on the phylogenetic tree based on genome sequences but are similar with respect to biological behavior (Zhang et al., 2007). IBV is known as a prototype virus of the Coronaviridae family.

In particular, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 are classified as effecter caspases that are activated by the respective initiator caspases in the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and can be considered as key enzymes involved in apoptosis since they are indispensable for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. In the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, caspase-8 is the initiator caspase that is activated by the interaction between external apoptotic factors and cell surface molecules such as Fas or Fas ligand via adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (Cohen, 1997). On the other hand, in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, caspase-9 is the initiator caspase whose activity is regulated by the expression balance between Bcl-2 and Bax via cytochrome c/Apaf-1 complex formation (Cohen, 1997, Strasser et al., 2000). In ECoV-infected MDBK cells, caspase-3/7 activity was increased at and after 15 HAT, and caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were increased at and after 12 HAT. These results indicate that ECoV can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in MDBK cells via both the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. However, the activation of the initiator caspase-8 can also be related to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via cleavage of Bid (a member of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family) and translocation of the truncated Bid to mitochondria (Wang et al., 1996). In some coronaviruses, both initiator caspases are activated in the course of apoptosis; the Fas-signaling pathway in which both initiator caspases are activated via cleavage and translocation of Bid was suggested as the mechanism of apoptosis, particularly in MHV infection (Eleouet et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2006, Liu and Zhang, 2007). Therefore, it was speculated that ECoV also induces apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway that may be activated by an interaction between virus protein and cell surface signaling factors with participation of both the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. However, further investigations that will focus on the kinetics of signal transduction factors are necessary to clarify the detailed mechanisms of ECoV-induced apoptosis.",
