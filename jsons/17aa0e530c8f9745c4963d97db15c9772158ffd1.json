We describe the expected form of the cross-correlation and show how, if the distribution of UHECR sources trace the large-scale cosmic structure, it could be easier to detect with current data than the UHECR auto-correlation. Moreover, the cross-correlation is more sensitive to UHECR anisotropies on smaller angular scales, more robust to systematic uncertainties, and it could be used to determine the redshift distribution of UHECR sources, as well as the UHECR chemical composition, making it a valuable tool in determining their origins and properties.",

Chemical composition and magnetic fields are degenerate when it comes to UHECRs deflections, since the latter depends on ZB/E, where Z is the atomic number, B the strength of the magnetic field, and E is the UHECR energy: doubling the field strength is equivalent to doubling the charge (or halving the energy). Chemical composition instead is the only factor that determines the UHECR propagation length at a given energy: different nuclei come from a different portion of the Universe and carry a different anisotropic imprint, but the relationship between the two is non-monotonic and non-trivial (see, e.g., [16, 17] ).",

            "text": "To a large extent, the statistics of the anisotropies in the distribution of UHECRs can be characterized by the UHECR angular auto-correlation (AC), which, in harmonic space, takes the form of angular the power spectrum coefficients C . Here, the -th multipole quantifies the variance of the anisotropies on angular scales \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/ [18, 19] (see Appendix A for further details). To date, the number of UHECRs collected at the highest energies is low -of the order of a hundred above the cutoff [2] . Because of this, the UHECR flux is dominated by Poisson statistics: the AC is mostly determined by shot noise, making the underlying correlation with the LSS very hard to detect. Indeed, the indications for anisotropy in the data are tenuous: save for a low-energy dipole [8] and a high-energy hot-spot [20] , the angular distribution of UHECR arrival directions appears to be nearly isotropic [21] . Moreover, no anisotropies have been detected at small scales 10 [22, 23] . In this work, we quantify the possibility of detecting the anisotropy in the UHECR flux through the harmonic-space power spectrum of the cross-correlation (XC) between UHECR counts and the distribution of galaxies. Such XC technique was previously proposed to study the anisotropy of the \u03b3-ray sky by Refs. [24] [25] [26] , and proved successful for several tracers of the LSS [27] [28] [29] [30] . If UHECR sources statistically trace the LSS, then the positions of these sources, and the arrival directions of UHECRs (if not strongly affected by intervening magnetic fields) should have a non-zero correlation with a galaxy sample up to a given distance. Therefore, the detection or non-detection of the XC signal with galaxies at different redshifts would allow us to test whether UHECR sources are distributed according to the LSS, and to quantify to which extent the UHECR transfer function, determined by energy losses and intervening magnetic fields, does not depend on direction.",

First, systematic uncertainties of different 'messengers', or observables, should not cross-correlate, and, under some conditions, statistical noise should also not strongly cross-correlate. This is because different experiments are different machines exploiting different physical effects. However, within a single dataset, for instance the set of arrival directions of UHECRs, the AC of the noise and systematic errors for that set are certainly non-zero, and contribute to hiding any underlying 'true' signal. Thus, in this sense the XC is an experimentally cleaner observable.",

Furthermore, small-scale power in the LSS angular distribution is comparable to that at large scales: if UHECRs bear the imprint of the LSS this small-scale power is distorted but not strongly suppressed by the GMF [33] ; moreover, the sub-structures of the GMF themselves imprint small-scale signatures in UHECR anisotropies [34] .

[50] ).

At low energies the UHECR sample contains many more events than at high energies because the UHECR spectrum is very steep (soft/red); however, for the range of energies we are interested in, the galaxy sample is much larger, so this does not have as strong an effect for the XC as it does for the traditional AC (whose noise is determined by the number of UHECT events). Moreover, at low energies UHECRs propagate further, and the larger line-of-sight averaging can dilute the expected anisotropy. Lastly, the effects of intervening magnetic fields are stronger. At high energies the UHECR horizon is smaller, UHECRs undergo smaller deflections, and the anisotropy should be more pronounced, but the number of events drops dramatically.",

Colours refer to the three energy cuts discussed above, namely red for E cut 40 EeV, yellow for E cut 63 EeV, and blue for E cut = 100 EeV. The dashed and dotted curves show the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions to the total power spectrum, with the sum of both shown by the solid curves. For simplicity, we have not included any beam smoothing in the plot. We can see how the signal for the XC is lower than the AC, as is expected from the fact that the XC mixes two different radial kernels. If we employ optimal weights for the XC the signal would become identical to that of the AC. In our simplistic linear treatment of perturbations, this happens because the UHECR and galaxy kernels would be identical. The statistical uncertainties for both correlation functions, however, would be different, given their different shot-noise levels. To understand better the role of the different uncertainties on the theoretical signal, in Fig. 3 we show again the expected signal as in Fig. 2 (solid curves, same colour code) and include a 1 \u2022 Gaussian smoothing beam to account for the angular resolution of UHECR experiments (for reference, we also show the beam-free prediction as dashed lines). On top of it, we present the corresponding -binned 1\u03c3 error bars as shaded boxes for 20 log-spaces multipole bins between min = 2 and max = 1000. If we compare the leftmost and central panels, namely AC vs XC, it is easy to see how the range of multipoles where error bars are small enough to allow a detection is larger for XC than for AC for the E cut 40 EeV and E cut 63 EeV cases. However, for the sparser UHECR sample with E cut = 100 EeV the opposite applies; more precisely, the detectable range of multipoles for the XC is smaller and pushed towards higher compared to the AC. This is due to a combination of two factors: for the higher end of UHECR energies the propagation horizon of UHECRs is small, and the UHECR sky looks more anisotropic, boosting the AC. At the same time, the mismatch in kernels is prominent, the more so the higher the energy, and it drives the XC signal down. Combined with the larger shot noise in the UHECR data, this can explain the performance of the 100 EeV case -indeed, the UHECR shot noise is the main factor that prevents a detection of the signal at mid-values (the per-signal is 1\u03c3 compatible with zero, see below).",

Additionally, while the uncertainty increases with energy as both samples become sparser, it is not large enough to hide the XC signal. It is worth noticing that the increase in galaxy power that we expect towards lower redshifts, is significantly less relevant than the matching of the radial kernels.",

The latter is produced by the inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons by hot electrons along the line-of-sight. Because a thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map is a map of CMB photons, it is very accurate down to angles much smaller than a degree, and its signal peaks at low redshifts [55] .

Recently, the IceCube collaboration has detected a few high energy astrophysical neutrinos, with energies above a PeV [56] . Such neutrinos are expected to be produced in the same extreme astrophysical sources as UHECRs and/or in their immediate surroundings. The cross-correlations between neutrinos and the LSS will then inform about the properties of the highest-energy astrophysical engines. Without the use of cross-correlations, because of the very small number of neutrino events in present data, and in the forseeable future [57] [58] [59] , the detection of the anisotropic pattern could be challenging. Since neutrinos interact extremely weakly, they can propagate unhampered for long distances: their horizon is almost the entire visible Universe. Therefore, in addition to galaxies, complementary information could be extracted from cross-correlating neutrinos with other tracers, including CMB lensing [60] and cosmic shear surveys [61] , both of which trace the overall matter distribution in the Universe, including both its dark and luminous components, out to higher redshifts with broader kernels (see Refs. [27] [28] [29] [30] for the analogous analysis with \u03b3 rays). Measuring these cross-correlations could reveal whether the most energetic particle accelerators in the Universe preferentially reside in high-density visible or dark environments.",
