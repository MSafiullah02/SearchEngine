            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease in cattle caused by a variety of pathogens. It affects both the upper and lower respiratory tract and the lungs of cattle (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009). BRD involves a wide variety of infectious agents. These include viruses such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3), bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), as well as bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma bovis. BRD is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in calves (Busato et al., 1997, Dutil et al., 1999, Windeyer et al., 2014). Busato et al. (1997) monitored 100 Swiss suckler beef herds from birth to weaning, in one generation of calves, and reported a pre-weaning calf mortality rate of five per cent. Over 50% of these mortalities were due to respiratory disease. Similarly, in a study of 467 suckler beef herds in Canada, Dutil et al. (1999) reported a pre-weaning calf mortality rate of 5.4% in herds with less than 40 females, and 5.6% in herds with 40 or more females. Of these recorded cases of mortality, 12.8\u201317.5% was due to respiratory disease. Windeyer et al. (2014) observed a case fatality risk for BRD of 7.1% in dairy heifer calves on commercial dairy farms in Minnesota and Ontario. In the Republic of Ireland, respiratory disease is the main cause of mortality in calves from one to three months of age. Almost 30% of calves between one and three months of age submitted to the Veterinary Laboratory Service in 2012 for necropsy died as a result of respiratory disease (All-Ireland Animal Disease Surveillance Report, 2012). Recognised risk factors for dairy calf mortality during the rearing period include calf birth weight, colostrum intake, milk feeding practices, housing, age at weaning and exposure to infectious disease (Brickell et al., 2009a, Brickell et al., 2009b, Sivula et al., 1996, Speicher and Hepp, 1973). However, the impact of these risk factors on calf mortality is often inconsistent across studies (Brickell et al., 2009a, Brickell et al., 2009b).",

Recovery following treatment depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and treated (Cusack et al., 2003). Earlier recognition of BRD would reduce the severity of the disease and decrease the costs for the Stockperson. Currently, BRD is detected by means of clinical signs including increased rectal temperature, abnormal breathing patterns, reduced feed intake, coughing, nasal or eye discharge (Poulsen and McGuirk, 2009). Treatment with antibiotics is normally initiated as soon as these symptoms are observed. However, detecting the disease in an earlier state, before the appearance of clinical symptoms, is more difficult.",

Instead of calculating only one duration, different durations were calculated to make the algorithm more robust (Fig. 4\n). The calculation was done in different steps. In step 1, the frequency values were summed together for each time period. In step 2, we went from the highest value to the lowest value of step 1 in ten levels. These are displayed as red\n1 arrows in Fig. 4. The length of each arrow was the duration of that level. To reduce the information in this feature a straight line was fitted through the durations based on reducing the squared error (Fig. 4).

However, detecting all coughs would mean 100% sensitivity which is unrealistic for such a high specificity. Therefore, the desired sensitivity had to be lowered in order to increase and the desired specificity had to be increased. In order to visualise the coughing trend in the calf houses, we need (1), to detect at least 50% of the labelled coughs i.e. a sensitivity of 50%.

The comparison was done with the Euclidean distance between the two rough spectrograms. This resulted in a Euclidean distance value per sound event.

A few sound events labelled as coughs did not have a comparable rough spectrogram to the majority of labelled coughs. Other sound events labelled as coughs were only comparable to a restricted number of other labelled coughs. To consider these irregular coughs, a weighted threshold was developed on the Euclidean distance value. The higher the threshold, the more a sound event could deviate from that labelled cough, or the higher the Euclidean distance value could be. This threshold was chosen as the highest Euclidian distance value which achieved a precision of 90% for that specific labelled cough in the training set. This method is a simplified version of a pig cough detection algorithm from the literature (Van Hirtum et al., 2003). This version is faster compared with their use of a dynamic time warping method (Rabiner and Juang, 1993). The threshold tm for each labelled cough m had to fulfil the following equation in which the result between square brackets is either 1 if true or 0 if false. The threshold was found by exhaustively going over all thresholds tm.(5)0.9=\u2211l=1nlelm<tm&lisalabelledcough\u2211l=1nlelm<tm\n",

Therefore, a calibration step was added to the algorithm in the present study as described under Section 2.9.4. The calibration step considered the difference in recordings between the three houses. These differences could possibly be explained by different building acoustics of the houses or a different set-up of the sound recording equipment. The performance results of Table 3 shows that the recordings of house 3 were more different compared to the two other houses. This difference in recording had previously been remarked by the labeller. The table further shows that the calibration step improved the performance in house 3 as intended but decreased the sensitivity with two percent in house 2 (Table 3). The reason for the decreased sensitivity was not investigated as the performance was still acceptable. This showed that calibration mainly improved the house that sounded differently and this difference will most likely happen in practice. This performance difference also demonstrates that applying the pig coughing algorithms as described in literature on another experimental set-up is probably not straightforward.",

However, in house 2, GS2 suggested that more calves presented with BRD than GS1 on 2nd May. In house 3, GS2 indicated that there were calves presenting with BRD but this did not correspond to either GS1 or an increased coughing period. Therefore, it appears that GS1 was better correlated than GS2 with the increased coughing periods. This may be because an increase in neutrophil number may be caused by many other infections or stresses other than BRD (Carroll and Forsberg, 2007)while the GS1 scoring was specific for symptoms of BRD (Lago et al., 2006). Recently, research compared blood samples to the number of coughs from pigs (Finger et al., 2014).

Therefore, we analysed the time between an increased coughing period and treatment for BRD. The animals were always treated after or during a period of increased coughing (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). This suggests that the veterinarian could have started the treatment earlier. How much earlier the treatment could have started is dependent on when the algorithm detects an increased coughing period. In the current paper this detection was not yet automated but visually assessed based on the number of coughs. Therefore, it was not possible to quantify how much earlier. These results show for the first time that detection of coughs may indeed be an early warning system for calves presenting with BRD. Instead of only using visual inspections in the calf house to detect BRD an automated cough detection method can assist the Stockperson in recognising BRD.",

Between 23 h and 12 h there were on average 38% more coughs than between 13 h and 22 h. The greater number of coughs could be explained due to husbandry management between 7 h and 12 h (including feeding and cleaning, replenishing of bedding, health observations) disturbing the calves. Calves were consequently more active in the morning hours than during the afternoon.",

This calf cough detection algorithm achieved on average 50.3% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity and 87.5% precision. Even with the low sensitivity a total of five periods with increased coughing were observed. For all five periods, a number of calves were treated for BRD during or after the observed coughing period. This indicates that automated detection of coughs may be an early warning system for calves presenting with BRD. This automated cough detection method could thus assist the Stockperson in recognising BRD alongside visual inspections in the calf house.",
