J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract Herein, we describe the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 genome through metatranscriptome nextgeneration sequencing directly from the nasopharyngeal swab of a suspected case of local transmission of Covid-19, in Brazil. Depletion of human ribosomal RNA and use of an optimized in-house developed bioinformatics strategy contributed to successful detection of the virus.

Possible interfering factors in RT-qPCR may arise from high viral recombination of coronaviruses (5) and varying viral loads in the natural course of disease (6) , but this still needs further studies in the COVID-19 diagnostics context (7) . Therefore, developing new protocols for untargeted clinical metagenomics may provide valuable diagnostic tools for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in a current global scenario of emerging viral infections. Other studies have recently reported on metagenome-based strategies for next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and varying results were reached, when comparing amplicon-based sequencing or direct metatranscriptome sequencing. Also, metagenome sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens rendered better results when compared to nasal swabs (5, 8) .",

On March 03, 2020, a female patient presented to a public hospital, in Feira de Santana-Bahia, Brazil, complaining of sore-throat and mild-dyspnea. Due to self-reported close contact with a returning traveler from Italy who had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, specific diagnostic investigation was warranted, and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was immediately collected. Viral RNA extraction and RT-qPCR amplification were carried out following a protocol validated in our group at the Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador-BA, Brazil, according to a Promega application report (Promega Application Report, 2020; https://www.promega.com.br/applications/virus-detection-assay-coronavirusdetection-covid-19-sars-cov-2/). In brief, 200 \u00b5L of samples stored in transport medium In parallel, the extracted RNA (ca. 14 ng/\u00b5L) was submitted to metatranscriptome nextgeneration sequencing in the Ion S5 platform (ThermoFisher) using an Ion 540\u2122 chip and the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2, as per the manufacturer's protocol (ThermoFisher). One sample was previously processed with the Low Input RiboMinus\u2122 Eukaryote System v2 (ThermoFisher), for depletion of human ribosomal RNA from total RNA (Fig. 1) . Sequence reads were pre-processed by quality filtering (Phred >20), presence of ambiguous bases (filtering out of reads with >1% Ns), and size (reads >= 30 nt); all reads deriving from human transcripts were also discarded: 77.29%",

Viral contigs were further submitted to contig extension using SPAdes and 'trusted contigs' option that was followed by cap3 tool to remove sequence redundancy. B) SARS-Cov-2 coverage profile of reads and assembled contigs. Reads were normalized by number of reads from each library. Contigs in red indicate high quality contigs larger than 400nt with coverage of reads in both libraries. ",
