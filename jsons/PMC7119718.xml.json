            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an important disease economically to the poultry industry because it affects chickens of all ages and causes respiratory and nephrotic syndromes in broilers, reduced egg production in layers and breeders (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997). This disease is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the family Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales) and genus Coronavirus (Cavanagh, 1997, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). IBV is an enveloped virus containing an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virion includes four major structural proteins: the surface spike glycoprotein (S) consisting of two subunits S1 and S2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein and the envelope (E) protein. N protein of IBV is highly conserved, highly immunogenic. It carries epitopes inducing cross-reactive antibodies and is the most abundant virus-derived protein produced throughout infection (Seah et al., 2000). N protein may also induce cross-protective immunity (Boots et al., 1992, Seo et al., 1997, Yu et al., 2001).",

Three primers for sequencing the H52 reference strain were used to amplify two overlapping fragments of IBV N gene by PCR: N1IBV\u2013N3IBV, fragment 1; N2IBV\u2013N3IBV, fragment 2 (Table 1\n, Fig. 1c). Restriction sites BamHI were added to 5\u2032-ends of the two upstream primers N1IBV and N2IBV or HindIII to 3\u2032-end of the downstream primer N3IBV. The open reading frame (ORF) was between 433 and 1242 bp. RT-PCR amplification of two truncated fragments of the N-gene was performed as follows: reverse transcription (50 \u00b0C, 15 min), denaturation of RNA and inactivation of reverse transcriptase (94 \u00b0C, 3 min), standard PCR steps including denaturation (94 \u00b0C, 0.5 min), annealing (50 \u00b0C, 0.5 min) and extension (72 \u00b0C, 1 min) for 35 cycles (Lugovskaya et al., 2002). The PCR products of expected sizes are shown in Fig. 1a. The sizes of the two truncated fragments were 809 and 398 bp, respectively.

Bacterial whole-cell lysates and purified recombinant proteins were applied to 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis at constant voltage 200 V. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 to detect proteins. The protein band of approximately 20 kDa was clearly visualized following the induction of fusion protein from pQEN2IBV with IPTG. At the same time, partial SDS-PAGE proteolysis was shown to proceed in the course of expression of the fusion protein from pQEN4IBV; two protein bands of approximately 35 and 30 kDa were seen (Fig. 2a and b).

Thereafter, goat anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase labeled antibodies (Synbiotics Corp., USA) were added at a working dilution and held for 1 h at room temperature. Washing of wells in TBST four times ended each stage. The antigen\u2013antibody complexes were detected with ABTS (40 mM 2.2\u2032-azino-di-3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonic acid) as substrate and 4 mM hydrogen peroxide in 100 mM citrate buffer pH 4.5. The color development was stopped with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) after 15-min incubation and the intensity was measured at 405 nm (SLT-spectra, Austria).",

Simultaneously the same serum samples were analyzed at a 1:100 dilution. The reactivity of each test sample was determined by subtracting the mean optical density (OD) of the negative control from the mean OD of duplicate test samples. The resulting corrected OD value for a test sample was divided by the mean OD value of the positive control from which the mean negative OD value was subtracted, and the results were expressed as the S/P ratio. The regression line to correlate the results of single and serial two-fold dilution methods was plotted with the aid of the computer program \u201cStatistica, correlation matrices\u201d (Stat. Soft. Inc., USA). A regression line was plotted to correlate the rNpIBV-ELISA end-point and the S/P value of 216 chicken serum samples at a 1:100 dilution. The equation of regression line was log10\n \nT\n = 3.612 + 1.755 \u00d7 log10\n S/P. The correlation coefficient r\n = 0.9615 was obtained.
