However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, as well as important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

Of note, all the patients in the severe (S) and mild (M) groups had survived from COVID-19 and been discharged from the hospital. F1 represents the first samples collected from the COVID-19 fatal patients, while F4 represents the last samples before additional samples could be collected. S1 or M1 represents the samples during the disease peak of the patients in the severe or mild group as being determined based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China (10), while S2 or M2 represents the last samples collected from patients in each group before the patients were discharged from the hospital. For comparison, the blood samples from 10 healthy volunteers, whose throat swabs and serological testing were negative for SARS-CoV-2, were collected. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites were extracted from each plasma sample, respectively and measured by employing liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) system. The metabolite identification was conducted by home-made database with retention time and ion pairs. For those metabolites without authentic standards in our database, we still used MS/MS spectra to search against the public databases for improving the confidence of metabolite identification. The orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to discriminate metabolomic profiles between the groups of COVID-19 patients and healthy people (Figure S1-S4). In total, 431 metabolites and 698 lipids were identified and quantified, and both metabolome and lipidome showed dramatic alterations in the plasma of these COVID-19 patients (Table S2 and S3).",

On the other hand, in the case of the fatality group, differentiating metabolites significantly enriched in 4 pathways, including thyroid hormone synthesis, thyroid hormone signaling, purine metabolism, and autoimmune thyroid (Figure 2C-D and Table S7), suggesting that the alterations in these pathways are associated with the progress and deterioration of COVID-19. A prominent signature observed among fatal COVID-19 patients was an acute reduction of metabolites in patient plasma with the aggravation of the course of COVID-19. By comparing healthy subjects and fatal patients, we highlighted top 5 differentiating metabolites (Figure 3). For instance, malic acid, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, exhibited the greatest log 2 FC (-5.2) among all significantly altered metabolites in the fatalities.

Besides, for either severe or mild groups of patients, many of their lipids had not returned to normal before their discharge from hospital (Figure 4B, S2 vs H and M2 vs H), even though SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected and the major clinical signs had disappeared in these patients based on official discharge criteria. Obviously, like the observations of metabolomic alterations, these discharged patients, no matter if they had experienced severe or mild symptoms, had not been fully recovered from the aftermath of COVID-19 in the aspects of both metabolite and lipid metabolisms.Furthermore, the differentiating lipids were divided into those shared by all groups (F vs. H and S vs. H plus M vs. H) or those unique to the fatality group (F vs. H), and subsequently subjected to KEGG functional enrichment analysis. As shared by all the three symptomatic groups, differentiating lipids enriched in total 7 pathways, in particular, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, long-term depression, leishmaniasis, and inositol phosphate metabolism (Figure 5A-B and Table S10).

In summary, the metabolomic and lipidomic datasets of the cohort of COVID-19 patients under different symptomatic conditions are highly valuable resources for a better understanding of the host metabolic responses associated with COVID-19, which expands our knowledge about the pathogenesis of COVID-19, accelerates identification of disease biomarkers and development of diagnostic assays, and provides hints of potential therapeutic strategies.",
