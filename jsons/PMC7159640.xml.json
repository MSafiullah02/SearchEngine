Furthermore, systemically administered \u03b8\u2010defensins were nontoxic, stable in plasma, and did not stimulate an immune response in adult chimpanzees.117 In an earlier study, prophylactic treatment with RTD\u20101 prevented lethal infection of mice with a mouse\u2010adapted strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.118 However, \u03b8\u2010defensins are neither virus\u2010 nor lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010neutralizing, suggesting that their immunomodulatory activity and ability to bind to carbohydrate\u2010containing cell\u2010surface receptors helped prevent viral infection.117, 118 Furthermore, binding to cell\u2010surface receptors or plasma proteins might concentrate \u03b8\u2010defensins at infection sites.59\n",

The discovery of \u03b8\u2010defensins in 1999 revealed that mammals also produce cyclic peptides. Since 2000, chemical tools for discovery, sequencing, synthesis, and structure determination have facilitated investigations into the structures and mechanisms of action of cyclic peptides. While interest in the antimicrobial properties of \u03b8\u2010defensins has led to mechanistic insights, the discovery of new \u03b8\u2010defensins has lagged considerably behind other cyclic peptides. Furthermore, the biosynthetic mechanism of \u03b8\u2010defensins from two separate gene products remains one of the most intriguing yet elusive questions in the field. The growing interest in peptide\u2010based drugs in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the increasing number of validated targets for drugs that disrupt protein\u2013protein interactions, provides many opportunities for applications of \u03b8\u2010defensins. Further studies on the structures, mechanisms of action, and synthesis of \u03b8\u2010defensins will help to promote their development as therapeutic agents. We anticipate that the next few years will see the discovery of new \u03b8\u2010defensins and the development of novel applications based on their favorable chemical properties and biological activities.",
