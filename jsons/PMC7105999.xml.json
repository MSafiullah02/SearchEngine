            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the pathogen responsible for porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). PED causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss, especially among neonatal piglets, and the morbidity and mortality of PED in neonatal piglets can reach 90%\u2013100%. PEDV first appeared in England (21) and Belgium (15) in the early 1970s, and outbreaks later occurred in the Czech Republic, China, Korea, Vietnam, and the United States. Since 2010, new mutant strains of PEDV have been discovered in China (4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 29, 30). These strains spread to the United States, South Korea, and southeast Asia and caused significant economic losses to the pig industry. The pathogenesis of PEDV is not clear, and the mechanism for infection of cells by PEDV remains largely unknown. Recently, PEDV infection has been shown to cause S-phase arrest of porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) (24, 25). In a study of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), it was also found that PEDV can cause S-phase arrest of ST cells (2). Furthermore, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and other coronaviruses can cause G0/G1- or G2/M-phase arrest (3, 7, 19, 26, 27, 28). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which epidemic strains of PEDV affect the mammalian cell cycle have not been elucidated. In this study, Vero cells were infected with the epidemic SHpd/2012 PEDV strain to determine the effect on cell cycle progression, to explore the molecular mechanisms producing the effects of PEDV on the cell cycle, and to provide theoretical support for a better definition of the pathogenesis of PEDV.",

We evaluated cell-cycle proportions using BrdU-PI bicolour-labelled flow cytometry, which determines the proportion of S-phase cells by inserting BrdU into newly replicated DNA molecules, and indicates cells in the G1/G0 and G2/M phases by PI bound to chromosomes in all stages of the cell cycle.

Similarly, SARS-CoV protein 7a had the same impact on cyclin D3 and Rb, and the 44\u201382 amino acid region of the ORF 7a gene may be involved in this function (27). Eukaryotic expression of EGFP-tagged 3b protein in Vero, HEK-293 and COS-7 cell lines has been found to block the G1/G0 phase of host cells. In addition, the N protein of SARS-CoV also plays a role in arresting the host cell cycle (18), by binding to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex to inhibit the synthesis of genomic DNA (blocking the S phase). Further studies confirmed that the N protein could also bind to cyclin D directly, inhibit the activity of the Cdk4-cyclin D complex, and downregulate the expression of Cdk2 and the activity of the Cdk2 complex. Additionally, the downregulation of E2F1 was also observed in Vero E6 cells transfected with the N protein (18).",

Furthermore, by adding the inhibitor of the p53 molecule, it was found that such inhibitory effect would weaken the cycle-arrest effect of TGEV infection on ST and PK-15 cells, thus leading to speculation that TGEV infection activates the signal pathway of the p53 molecule, on the activation of which depends the cycle-arrest phenomenon (1).",
