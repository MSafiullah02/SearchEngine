The regulation will continue to require a rehabilitation physician to be a licensed physician with specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation. We are not lowering these requirements.\" 1 34",

However, the financial savings from utilizing less costly and less well trained or 42 experienced staff may be more than offset by increased costs due to reductions in the quality of 43 IRF care. These proposed regulatory changes will not supersede local state standards and 44 individual hospital guidelines that may be stricter. 45 46 CMS will continue to utilize a relative weighting of diagnostic factors to account for a patient's 47 clinical characteristics and expected resource needs as defined by the current prospective 48 payment system (PPS) and case-mix groups (CMGs) methodology. 3 However, retrospective data 49 does not take into account that there may have been statistical bias with regards to the current 50 PPS CMG data due to the previous application of the training and experience requirements, the 3 51 hour rule and the 60% rule. 2-4 The potential effects on rehabilitation quality and cost will not 52 become evident until new data become available for analysis. Differentiating which factor may 53 be significant, considering the rapidity of these changes, will be difficult. 54 55 Furthermore, CMS has proposed increasing reimbursement by 2.9% for IRFs, 3 creating a 56 financial windfall to IRF owners. 3 IRF care is already reimbursed at 2.5 times the national 57 average for CMS reimbursement compared to standard acute care hospital admissions. 7 These 58 proposed regulations create a significant incentive to provide the minimum required services for 59 the maximum reimbursement. 6 For-profit IRFs already provide over 50% of IRF care and must 60 answer to their investors creating an additional incentive to support the regulatory changes. can be conveniently forwarded at the following web site. 77 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/21/2020-08359/medicare-program-78 inpatient-rehabilitation-facility-prospective-payment-system-for-federal-fiscal). 3 79",
