Existing QAC models have pursued a little on user interaction and cannot capture a user's information need (IN) context. In this work, we devise a new task of QAC applied on an image for estimating patch (one of the key components of Information Foraging Theory) probabilities for query suggestion. Our work supports query completion by extending a user query prefix (one or two characters) to a complete query utilising a foraging-based probabilistic patch selection model. We present iBERT, to fine-tune the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which leverages combined textual-image queries for a solution to image QAC by computing probabilities of a large set of image patches. The reflected patch probabilities are used for selection while being agnostic to changing information need or contextual mechanisms. Experimental results show that query autocompletion using both natural language queries and images is more effective than using only language-level queries. Also, our fine-tuned iBERT model allows to efficiently rank patches in the image.",

Popular features such as QAC make people more dependent on search engines to find any relevant information. However, such kind of factor lets users express their queries only ambiguously, which are then overly vague to be completely interpreted by search engines. This makes query auto-completion a bottleneck construct in the usability of search engines [5] .",

Past work [6, 20] demonstrated the use of information scent to model users' information need during web search, and it has been used to understand the factors affecting search and what takes a user to stop the search. Despite the good observation, the exploitation of information scent (from Information Foraging Theory [27] ) is under-explored in case of ambiguous queries and have not been extended to take into account an image in query expansion (or suggestion) tasks. For the users' convenience, current search engines generally endue query suggestions for them in order to describe their queries more explicitly. They have been explored extensively in query auto-completion tasks, especially the traditional approach known as Most Popular Completion (MPC) [3] which at the extreme is incapable of anticipating a query it has never seen before. Solutions further improved by recent semantically-driven models [23, 24] and neural model [26] approaches which are the current state-of-the art in QAC. However, most of the language embedding models [13] have obtained strong results on multiple benchmarks for understanding the polarity of word compositions. Unsupervised pre-trained natural language embeddings [7, 21] successfully model long term dependencies with the purpose of predicting masked terms and assessing if sentences ensue one another, which showed strong results on several natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. Empirically, recent advances in sequence models have been adapted to span a prefix to full text and index [12] but despite the attainment, it has not been generalised to take an image into account. Also, deep neural networks are mature enough and capable of segmenting regions within an image [9, 10] .",

We apply our ideas to an image search scenario where we assume patches are regions of images that are relevant to the user's information need. Our work is concerned with providing users of image search engines with a useful query suggestion (via a visually-oriented patch form) during interaction, to further amplify their exploratory search experience. Hence, finding useful patches for query expansion in an image based on textual queries (or descriptions) is the primary focus of our work. Past work [11, 30] used both the query and image for typical retrieval and segmentation tasks. In our task formulation, we rely only upon a given arbitrary text prefix rather than having the entire text query which is used to perform search based on the image and supported by a modified deep language model [12] to find the most relevant patch in the image. We break down the task into three sub-tasks: (a) completing the query from user query prefix and an image; (b) finding patch probabilities based on the complete user query, and (c) aligning and segmenting all patches in the image.

The predictions in IR systems are generally driven by the query logs (or query history) which are the factual queries that users have previously entered as they were trying to satisfy their information need [14, 37] . [3] introduced a method called NearestCompletion that addresses the situation of \"context\" which depicts the users' preceding queries in suggestion-based IR systems. The authors' proposed MPC mechanism relies on the entire popularity of the queries conforming to the provided prefix. Recent work reported in [15] studies user reformulation behaviour by leveraging textual features, whereas [31] introduced personalised query auto-completion and found that utilising a user's long-term search logs and locations as well as both context-based textual features and demographic features is more effective. More recent advances in QAC using neural language models are proposed in [26] using recurrent neural networks that effectuate the performance on immediately unseen queries. A generalised and adaptable language model for personalised QAC is introduced in [12] . We extend this adaptable language model to query completion in an image search scenario in the following section.",

            "text": "Information Foraging Theory: Information Foraging Theory (IFT) [27] is a theoretical framework for understanding information access behaviour, derived from the ecological science concept of optimal foraging theory which applies to how humans access information. IFT stands on three different models, namely information scent model, information patch model and information diet model, which can illustrate users' search preferences and behaviours [19] : (1) The information within a certain environment scattered in form of patches (images, text snippets, documents) consisting of information features (colors, words) refers to the information patch model ; (2) A user can go from one patch to another via a cue (e.g., typing a query by following perceptual or heuristic cues [32] ), which meets the user's information need. The goal of such cues is to characterise the contents that will be envisaged by trailing the links, which refers to the information scent model ; (3) Different types of information sources will vary in their information access costs. Users will assess the information sources based on information gain per unit cost or varied profitability, and then the users will narrow or expand diversities of information sources based on their profitability. This user behaviour refers to the information diet model. One of the main IFT concepts are information patches. For instance, sections and their associated features in search engine results can be considered patches. From a foraging perspective in image search, the searcher is the predator (or forager [38] ), the information patch is any segment or a region within an image (or image itself) in a given information environment. The piece of information a user is looking for is the prey, and the consumed (or gained) information is the information diet. Something on the user interface that informs users about a specific place they should look next is referred to as a cue of the information scent.",

An initial attempt using neural language models has been introduced in [33] . The benefit of using character-level neural language models is providing more fine-grained predictions but they suffer from the semantic understanding that word-level models provide. For a prefix that has not been seen before (such as an incomplete word), their model enriches the shared information among comparable prefixes to create prediction nonetheless. In our scenario, we are given a prefix to complete a query conditioned on an image. To solve this new QAC problem, we exploit and extend the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) language model [12] with combined input and forget gates to auto complete queries. The language model is made up of a single-layer character-level LSTM with layer normalisation [2] . Our extension and modification to this language model is that we replace user embeddings with a low-dimensional representation of images. We adapt this LSTM language model alongside a context-dependent weight matrix W replaced by W C = W + M A . We are providing a character embedding w c \u2208 R e , a preceding hidden state h c\u22121 \u2208 R h , where M A is the adaptation matrix constructed by the product (\u00d7 i denotes the i-th-order tensor product) of the context c with two basis tensors, T L \u2208 R u\u00d7(e+h)\u00d7v and T R \u2208 R v\u00d7h\u00d7u .

IFT postulates that the human information seekers follow an information scent to navigate from one information region to another in an information environment that is instinctively patchy in nature, and from one information patch to another within a region. IFT implies that foragers adapt their behaviour to the structure of the information environment in which they prevail such that the entire system (encompassing the information seeker, the information environment, and the interactions among these two) tries to maximise the ratio of the expected value of the information gained to the total cost of the interaction. Following the IFT analogy, when users start typing a prefix to auto-complete, their perceptual cues (such as mental beliefs [36] ) either allow them to type the next character or to access the provided suggestion (under the query field) which acts as a distal cue and visually inspires the user to acquire them instantly to forage or seek. Query auto-completion, from an IFT perspective as query-level user interaction, is initiated by the user typing as little as a single-character query prefix. The user then may follow suggestions in case a completion is generated (which again follows the earlier mentioned strategy). In case the query prefix is unknown to the system (e.g. by being entered for the first time) the information scent associated with a result might be too poor [6] to immediately infer information needs. In this case we are applying beam search to generate the query based on image features. Suggestions are based on information scent values as described in the following subsection. These query suggestions represent the diversity of information scent patterns which elicits a varied distribution of relevant queries in the search field.",

We utilise IFT to infer the user's information need utilising the Inferring User Need by Information Scent (IUNIS) algorithm [6] which was proposed to weigh each page vector along with the two factors i.e., TF-IDF weight and time, that were used to quantify the associated information scent with the page. In our image search scenario, we have images as search results where an image is considered as a set of patches containing features such as color, shape, texture, etc. In our proposed iBERT model, we use information scent to inspect patches based on image features and select patches which have higher probability estimated by the iBERT model. Probabilistic Patch Selection Model (PPSM) is a first attempt to reflect users' information need coherently by means of information scent. PPSM is used for a task that extends finding patches and makes the quantification of semantic uncertainties an important choice in selection. The important requirement for PPSM is a model (iBERT) that identifies patches in an image which are relevant to the user's information need (query). Inspired by the concept of TF-IDF in IR, we represent the categorical distribution of frequency (f pi ) of each patch in an image (from the search results) in a given query session Q s and the ratio of total number of query session (Q T ) during the entire search process to the number of query sessions (N q ) that contain the given patches (p i ) found in Q s .

To generalise this for finding the information scent of a patch which then is assessed to select patches with higher information scent and then compared against the patch probability obtained via iBERT to distinguish the result. If we assume that the generated auto-completions induce several suggested queries (representing different information needs) simultaneously, every suggestion is in a competition to be discriminated as evident to the user. In the same way, an image contains multiple related or unrelated patches within it, and users find it difficult to judge which patches are relevant among images, which is due to the high uncertainty of correlated features within an image spread via patches. This motivates us to estimate the information scent of an image patch. There are two ways to compute the information scent of an image; one is to hire individual judges to rate scent on a scale [27] and the second approach is an algorithmic approach [28] . To estimate the information scent of a patch, we consider that PPSM constitutes patches that are probability distributions over images as observations. We assume image features as activators to perceptual cues because the user interpretation to image features when matched gives rise to a selection of an item (i.e., patch). The distributions are independent Bernoulli distributions of the features. Each observation is allocated to a patch, but the number of patches is not necessarily fixed i.e., the model is a non-parametric mixture with a product of independent Bernoullis as observation model. Therefore, the log-probability of selecting an image I for patch p i",

These two datasets fit well for our tasks. The Visual Genome dataset includes images, region descriptions, question-answers, objects, relationships, and attributes. The region descriptions confer a substitution for queries as they refer to several objects in various regions of every image. Few region descriptions are referring phrases and few of them are quite alike to descriptions. For example, referring descriptions are \"guy sitting on the couch\", \"white keyboard on the desk\" and non-referring descriptions are \"couch is brown\" and \"mouse is in the charger\". The huge number of instances from the Visual Genome dataset makes it quite convenient for our task. The ReferIt dataset is a collection of referring expressions engaged to images which quite intently resemble probable user queries of images.

We match index T q of the true query prefix in the top 10 predicted completions where we estimate the MRR score as n 1 Tq and reinstate the reciprocal rank with 0 in case if query does not appear in the top 10 completions. The perplexity comparison on both collection of test queries utilising corresponding contexts i.e., images and indiscriminate noise. The perplexity on the Visual Genome and ReferIt test queries with both contexts is shown in Table 2 . During the evaluation on the Visual Genome and ReferIt test sets (or queries), we analyse the query prefix with different length for the corresponding context (noise and image). We found that mean reciprocal rank is altered by the query prefix length, as long-tailed queries are comparatively more difficult than queries of average length to match. Hence, we examine quite better performance for all prefix lengths on the ReferIt dataset (from Table 2 ). We evaluated our proposed iBERT model for finding patch probabilities which is used to select and rank patches in the image. We achieve an F1 score 4 of 0.7638 over 3,000 patch classes.",

The language model enriches both image features and text information in which the surplus of beam search over our model is efficiently able to predict future queries at least on a single character prefix. The significant increase in MRR is due to the inclusion of visual information within textual queries as explained by IFT model. Also, we present iBERT for patch selection to efficiently rank them in the image and eventually predicts the most suitable image for the auto-completed query, and compare against the result from probabilistic patch selection model. This work is among the first attempt to apply foraging-based strategy to QAC. The selfexplanatory power of IFT to understand user interaction at query level leads the foundation of probabilistic patch selection model to devise users' information need. Our future work is to generalise the referring expression with contextual model to distinguish referring and non-referring region descriptions. We intend to aggregate information from textual queries and visual descriptions to scale it for multimodal query auto-completion in a single model.",
