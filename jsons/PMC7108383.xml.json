How fast an epidemic grows is largely determined by two factors \u2013 the number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the epidemic starts (the basic reproduction number, R\n0) and the average time taken for secondary cases to be infected by a primary case (generation time, TG). R\n0 characterizes the intrinsic transmissibility of infections and depends on both disease biology (determining infectiousness) and host population structure (determining contact rates). TG is largely determined by the incubation period of the disease and the duration of infectiousness. R\n0 > 1 is essential to epidemic growth because, for an infection to be self-sustaining, every infected individual must infect at least one other. The target of vaccination campaigns is to reduce R\n0 below 1, thereby driving the disease extinct.",

Hence, the number infected by one individual is now reduced by the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible. This causes the incidence of new infections to decline, and when the susceptible population is exhausted, the primary epidemic is over. Disease extinction is again possible by chance, particularly in small populations. Otherwise, infection continues, with new births replenishing the susceptible population, and eventually an endemic equilibrium is reached in which every infected person infects one other individual on average. From the definition of R\n0, this occurs when 1/R\n0 of an individual's contacts are susceptible at any point in time, and thus R\n0 not only determines the epidemic growth rate, but also the proportion of the population that are infected by the disease, and the steady-state incidence of infection.",

Biostatistical techniques for such estimations are developing rapidly, but many problems remain, largely caused by the non-linear nature of transmission models and the extremely complex dynamics that they sometimes produce; this can include chaotic behaviour and stochastically induced intermittency in epidemic timing. Dynamic complexity can also place fundamental limits on the predictability of trends in the incidence of infectious disease. In some cases, short-term prediction of the course of an epidemic may be possible. In others, models may be predictive only in a probabilistic sense; for example, it might be possible to predict the number of epidemics of a certain size likely to occur in the next 10 years, but impossible to precisely predict weekly disease incidence over the next few months. Distinguishing these situations is a key challenge in epidemic modelling.",
