For over a decade before the new millennium, it had become clearly evident that the era of high growth in developed economies was over as business consolidations, shrinking margins, aging populations, declining profitability, and production overcapacity indicated that many sectors of established economies had slipped from growth to maturity. While it is true that the U.S. still occupies a position of global economic hegemony, it is clear that continued economic growth can only take place in the context of increased dependence on international partnerships. Today, some of the largest global corporations are combinations of once solely owned U.S. companies and foreign companies.",

The decline in global tensions, the explosion in communications technologies, the movement of former closed countries toward market economies, and the easing of protectionist attitudes have made foreign trade of critical importance in sustaining competitive advantage. In addition, countries like the U.S. can no longer avoid the fact that continued economic success is predicated on international trade. Many products, such as oil and other basic raw materials, must be imported; often cost-effective components assembled in foreign countries are critical for the production of domestic finished goods. Finally, there can be no denying that certain imported products are here to stay. China\u2019s growing leadership in the production of high-labor, low-cost commodities and textiles can only expect to expand; Japanese leadership in television sets and low-priced microelectronics and parity in the automobile market are testimony of the impact of foreign products on American purchasing habits.",

This globalization of competition has accelerated sharply in just the past few decades. The emerging economies in Eastern Europe, China, Japan, and South Korea have long looked to the U.S. import marketplace to sustain their growing economies and to gain trade parity. In addition, many developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Viet Nam, who enjoy lower operating costs, are also seeking to catapult their economies to \u201cworld-class\u201d status by supporting domestic companies with leadership in textiles, apparel, and electronics. The U.S. has countered by refocusing its efforts at increasing exports, not only with the major industrialized nations, but also with developing countries on a bi-lateral basis. The result has been a clear-cut requirement for American businesses to continuously decrease production and distribution costs if they are to remain competitive.",

Despite over a decade of recession, Japan still possesses the world\u2019s third largest economy. Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are becoming one China from the standpoint of trade. In 1993, the United States, Canada, and Mexico took the first step in signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a counterbalance to the emergence of the trading blocks in Europe and Asia. While much of the early fears of massive job losses and migration of businesses to Mexico have proven baseless as the agreement completes its second decade, NAFTA has helped to expedite trade between the U.S.\u2019s largest (Canada) and second largest (Mexico) trading partners (Figure 14.1).\n",

As companies seek to export products not only to major trading partners but also to markets dispersed throughout the world, logistics costs involved in international warehousing and transportation are critical in holding down prices and assuring tolerable margins. In addition, as many U.S. companies seek to source components or relocate their operations overseas, corporate planners are having to formulate logistics strategies that will guarantee the smooth and efficient flow of materials and products through the domestic and international distribution pipeline. In summary, the goal of these movements toward regional trading blocs is to reduce tariffs and customs requirements, streamline and standardize shipping documentation, and establish compatible transportation and material handling systems that enable countries belonging to a regional trade union to act as if they were a single commercial entity.",

There are two major areas driving this trend: financial and logistics deregulation. The massive changes brought about by such events as the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Market (IMM), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), have enabled establishment of global financial standards, the extension and guarantee of long-term import/export credits beyond individual bank capabilities, and the mechanism to exchange currencies and trade futures at market rates. The decision of the U.S. to drop the gold standard in the early 1970s has assisted in removing previous restrictions on the setting of monetary rates. In addition, the adoption of the Euro in 2002 has greatly facilitated the flow of global trade by providing another stable medium of exchange. While currency issues surround the Yuan and Ruble and talk of an alternate basket of currencies, financial markets so far have been content to rely on the U.S. dollar and the euro as the standard mediums of exchange.",

The decision of the U.S. in the early 1980s to deregulate transportation has been slowly but steadily expanding across the globe. Historically, governments rather than market forces determined the scope and price of transportation. Many nations did not allow foreign-owned carriers to operate within their borders. Many transport modes, such as the current rail system in Mexico, are still state owned or, as in Germany, a mixture of state-owned and private companies subsidized by the government. Today, removal of these barriers to free-market drivers in most industrialized nations have followed U.S. example. UPS, for example, currently operates via any combination of rail, motor, air, or water in over 190 countries in a seamless manner via ownership, joint marketing, and operating agreements. Beyond operating privileges and privatization, changes in cabotage (requirement that goods and passengers within a country only use domestic carriers) have been gradually relaxed, especially between countries in the European Union and NAFTA.",

Today, with the growth of competitors, both domestic and foreign, focused on price parity and value-added features, such as quality and service, vertical organizations cannot hope to sustain their previous market dominance without business partners. Global competition, high product and service quality expectations, short product life cycles, and rapidly shifting markets have motivated firms to seek partnerships and alliances both domestically and internationally.",

Many a U.S. Ford or GM dealer that formerly sold only domestic models often today have foreign import divisions for sales and services. Recent trends among global auto makers have indicated a flourish of joint ventures. The merger of Fiat with Chrysler, Toyota in Australia, Isuzu in Japan, and Daewoo in Korea are examples. In addition, GM has foreign-owned subsidiaries in Europe (Opel), the United Kingdom (Vauxhall), China, Korea, and South America (GM do Brasil).

The objective of end-to-end service with real time order visibility and order tracking has become the mantra of today\u2019s logistics service providers (LSPs) as they search to expand their international footprint. These global LSPs provide continuity and visibility to the logistics needs of customers across the entire supply chain, rather than dependence on individual players who perform narrow local transactions and then pass shipments on to the next channel partner. The goal is to provide customers with technology tools to control the global supply chain by enabling them to manage both the velocity and delivery points of goods as they move across global networks. Such a capability is critical for companies utilizing forms of intermodalism that combine ocean-land bridge (ocean, rail or motor, and ocean), all water, or ocean/mini-land bridge (ocean and rail or motor) transport.",

These costs not only can greatly fluctuate by country and region, they are often complex and continuously changing. While the impact of tariffs and trade regulations are compiled by every country\u2019s department of commerce, they are published in widely different formats, taxonomies, and languages.

While trade laws, exchange rates, tariffs and restrictions, coping with long transit distance, global finance, and handling political risk are difficult enough for the international planner, cultural differences pose a serious threat to success. A failure to understand local customs or an unintentional violation of social taboos can create a veiled resistance on the part of nationals to do business with offending outside traders. While many practices and the use of logistics assets are uniform across the world, global companies must be able to manage the following cultural issues [7].\nTrade relationships. The personal elements necessary to develop trade relationships vary widely by nation. For example, in the U.S. business is conducted over the phone or by e-mail. In Asia, face-to-face contact is a requirement.\nUse of LSPs. The use of LSPs is perceived in some countries as a negative factor, indicating that a trading partner does not possess sufficient competencies.\nContracts. Many cultures have different views regarding the binding power of contracts. In the U.S., contracts are perceived as legal and moral documents that possess the force of law and personal commitment. In some countries a contract is understood as a statement of intent, and if the environment in which the contract was originally drafted changes drastically, parties are justified in abandoning their commitment to the contract.\nWorking styles. The work ethic and considerations of holidays and pay may differ greatly from country to country. In Europe, for example, many nationals expect lengthy vacation and holiday seasons. The best way to manage local workers is to have local or regional managers guiding employee decisions. The golden rule is to strategize globally, but execute regionally using the local language and culture.\nSpeed. In many cultures the signing of contracts or commitments to strategic decisions are a lengthy affair. While U.S. strategists are accustomed to quick deals and rapid decision deployment, many cultures often wish to deliberate over alternatives before making a decision.\n",

Such barriers require products to be loaded and unloaded, sometimes by hand, from vehicles/containers as they cross national boundaries.

An effective analysis should cover the whole world, ensuring that no relevant market, competitor, or trend is overlooked. The second strategic dimension involves assessing organizational strengths and weaknesses. A firm understanding of this strategic area enables global planners to deal effectively with opportunities, threats, and global trends. In addition, the firm should identify its own particular area of distinctive competence.

Before detailed market analysis begins, however, it is important that the firm defines its international marketing objectives and policies. This process normally consists of three parts. To begin with, global planners must determine the desired proportion of foreign sales to total sales. This ratio depends on product, competition, logistics channel requirements, and market-place aspirations. Second, planners choose between marketing and distributing to a few target countries or to many countries. Generally, it makes sense to begin first by selecting a few countries in which a strong commitment and significant product penetration can occur. Finally, the firm must decide on the types of countries with which they would like to do business with.

Effectively executing a global logistics strategy requires companies to find solutions to the following issues:Balancing company resources (capital and inventories) and organizational structure with the needs of the global marketplace.Monitoring and managing the constant changes occurring in global trade. Trends include shifting attitudes toward tariffs, administrative procedures, restrictions on inter-country transportation modes, and warehouse storage, as well as managing the pace of rapidly changing marketing and logistics strategies, new product introduction, and increased information linkages.

Distribution channels in Europe, for example, are very mature and require local distribution centers, local management of transportation owing to the number of transit countries, knowledge of local customs, and regulations dealing with the European Union.

This type of export LSP arranges transportation for cargo shipped from a domestic to a foreign market. A forwarder LSP is not by itself a carrier, nor do they buy and resell space on carriers. Instead, they act as an intermediary between the shipper and the carrier. Among the activities performed are quoting carrier rates, arranging charters or booking vessel space, preparing and presenting documentation, obtaining insurance, managing payments, and arranging inland transportation. In the U.S., forwarders must be licensed by the government, but they are not subject to certification requirements. Forwarders derive income from a combination of fees, markups, and commissions.\nExport trading company (ETC). This type of export LSP is an excellent choice for a company that is a newcomer to global trade or is unwilling to undertake any of the activities required of an exporter. An ETC itself is an exporter rather than a consultant to an exporter. An ETC works with producers and distributors that provide the finished goods that it wants to buy and resell in a foreign market. ETCs perform many export-related functions such as the purchasing and selling of goods, arrangement for the transportation and warehousing of goods from the export company to the foreign customer, financing currency conversion and absorbing rate fluctuations, assisting with consulting advice, and other logistics issues. More complex structured ETCs are known as international trading companies.\nExport merchants. Export merchants act as a form of international wholesaler. Similar to domestic wholesalers, they purchase goods from domestic producers and distributors and then pack and ship them to foreign markets. Although some export merchants may have facilities located in foreign countries close to the target market, they mostly deal with foreign intermediaries in the country of destination.\nResident buyers. Foreign firms and governments often locate buyers directly in the import country. Their responsibility is to locate, purchase, and ship goods to their home countries. Sears, for example, maintains buyers in foreign countries who buy direct from producers for resale in the United States.\nExport commission house. This type of intermediary performs the same functions as a resident buyer except that the buyer is not an employee but rather an independent agent empowered to negotiate, buy, and ship from firms in the exporting country. In return, the commission house is normally paid a commission by the foreign buyer.\nAllied manufacturer. Exporting through a business partner is an easy, cost-effective way of shipping overseas. In the arrangement, a company with well-established foreign trade activities negotiates to \u201cpiggy-back\u201d the products of other domestic firms with shipments of their own products to foreign countries. The advantage is mutual. For the shipping company, carrying other products assists in presenting foreign markets with extended product lines or achieving a higher utilization of transportation and warehousing capacities. For the exporting firm, the arrangement provides them with a good deal of the benefits of a mature foreign trade system without the investment.\nExport management company (EMC). An export management company is a product line or foreign market specialist who works that export for one or a group of noncompeting producers. Although most act as selling agents and consultants directly for their export clients, some of the larger firms do purchase products for resale. By working with an EMC, the exporter gains access to current information about the preferences of the local market, national customs, and government regulations.\nShip brokers and agents. This type of export LSP assists exporters with the details of arranging ocean transport. A broker is an independent intermediary that brings exporters together with ship operators that have cargo space available to carry the exporter\u2019s freight. In contrast, a ship agent works for the carrier. Agents arrange for the arrival of ships, berthing, and clearance; while the ship is in port, the agent coordinates unloading, loading, and fee payments.\nExport packing companies. This export LSP provides exporters with specialized packing services required for cargo being transported across continents. Besides optimizing packing space and minimizing damage, the LSP ensures that the cargo will pass customs inspection in the target nation.\n",

            "text": "Despite the advantages offered by indirect exporting, some firms choose to export directly to foreign nations. The choice of this strategy requires the establishment of company-owned exporting management functions. Usually this means the founding of an export department whose responsibility it is to establish the necessary distribution channels appropriate to each trading nation; find, maintain, and motivate intermediaries in targeted foreign countries; plan and execute all international shipping requirements; and, execute all export documentation. The major advantage of direct exporting is increased control over products sent to foreign markets. Disadvantages are found in the extra costs and overheads that arise from shipping directly to a foreign nation. The various types of direct export functions are described below.\nDomestic-based export department or division. Many companies have an export department or division in their organizations manned by an export manager and staff. This group executes actual selling and, in some instances, will perform other tasks associated with shipping, establishing logistics channels, and draft export documentation.\nForeign sales branch/subsidiary. Companies with a significant presence in certain foreign countries might elect to locate a sales branch or subsidiary in each country. Overseas branches permit the exporter a much greater control over marketing decisions and product positioning and provides on-site skills and services necessary for effective sales or marketing activities. In addition, branches may handle warehousing issues and promotions.\nTraveling export sales representatives. Export firms may send sales representatives directly to foreign nations to solicit and execute export arrangements and sales.\nForeign wholesale agents and merchants. There are several types of agents and merchants. A foreign sales agent is an independent contract sales representative that promotes and sells for an export company. The agent is generally compensated through commissions. The actual sale is shipped and paid for by the exporter and the foreign buyer. On the other hand, foreign merchant distributors buy the goods directly from the exporter and establish their own pricing, promotions, and other marketing strategies except where prohibited by contract.\nDirect sales. This is the least used form of direct export. In this technique, exporters seek to sell products directly to foreign retailers or even end-customers. Normally, this type of exporting is used only for high-ticket and specialty items sold to foreign governments, businesses, or institutions.\nGlobal web strategy. Within the past decade some of the world\u2019s leading companies have embarked on a direct export strategy using Internet e-commerce. The Internet has enabled companies to explore radically new avenues of reaching customers, sourcing from international suppliers, building global brand awareness, and conducting business transactions unthinkable in just the recent past. Companies from GM to direct-mail businesses such as L.L. Bean, Land\u2019s End, and Amazon.com use the web to penetrate global markets and gain significant boosts to their bottom line. For example, retailer and cataloguer The Sharper Image gets more than 25 % of its online business from overseas. e-Commerce provides an effective and cost-effective mechanism for gaining free exporting information and guidelines to conducting research and offering customers across the globe a secure process for searching, ordering, and paying for products.\n",

Licensing is defined as a contractual arrangement by which a firm (the licensor) in one country agrees to permit a company in another country (the licensee) the right to use a production process, trademark, patent, technical assistance, trade secret, merchandising knowledge, or other skill or technology. In exchange, the licensor will receive a fee or royalty. The objectives of a licensing agreement are straightforward: The licensor is able to gain access to a foreign market with a minimum of risk and capital expense; in turn, the licensee receives the right to distribute brand name products or access to proprietary processes either to found a business or to add to existing product lines. The best known examples of global licensing are Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s.

For example, the local producer can modify products or services to meet local tastes and customs while the licensor retains control of the brand name, quality standards, and so on. Also, licensing normally does not require a great deal of capital investment. Like exporting strategies, licensing provides licensors with a less risky method of gaining access to foreign markets than direct ownership, while providing sufficient flexibility to cancel unprofitable arrangements. On the negative side, the licensor has less control over the licensee than if the firm had established a directly-owned business. If the licensee does not live up to the terms of the contract, all the licensor can do is threaten to end the agreement. Finally, if the licensor decides to cancel the contract, they might find that they have not only lost control but have created a competitor with a strong market position in a foreign country where the licensor might subsequently find it difficult to penetrate on their own.",

Another method is contract manufacturing. In this method a firm licenses and agrees to assist a foreign company produce or distribute its products. Although licensing has the drawback of potential loss of control over processes, it does provide the firm with the opportunity of partnership or acquisition if the market matures. Perhaps the most recognizable form of licensing is franchising. In this model, the licensor offers a complete brand and marketing concept and a mature operating and structural format.

This includes exemption from inventory taxes and quotas.\nDuty exemption on re-exports. Since an FTZ is considered outside the commerce of the local government, a company importing materials or components into the FTZ does not pay customs duty until the inventory enters the nation\u2019s commercial system. If the inventory is exported from the FTZ, no customs duty is due.\nDuty elimination on waste, scrap, and yield loss. Since a producer in an FTZ does not pay duties on imports until the goods enter the commerce of the local country, it is essentially paying for the duties on the materials after they have been processed. As a result, duties owed do not include production waste and scrap, thereby reducing the amount of goods taxed.\nRelief from inverted tariffs. When the duty on imported components is higher than the duty on the finished product, it is called an \u201cinverted duty.\u201d To avoid the duty, a producer can bring low cost production inventories into the FTZ and process them into a finished good for export. When going through customs, the producer pays the duty on either the components or the finished goods, whichever is more advantageous.\nWeekly entry savings. Instead of filing an entry every time a shipment enters a country, an importer in an FTZ only needs to file one customs entry a week, thereby reducing documentation costs.\nImproved compliance, inventory tracking, and quality control. FTZs allow companies to more closely track their inventory. By bringing inventories into an FTZ warehouse controlled by the company, it is possible to identify and classify goods at the warehouse instead of at the port at a customs control location.\nIndefinite storage. A company can hold goods in an FTZ indefinitely. If there are quotas, the goods can be held until they are entered into the local country\u2019s commercial system without falling under quota restrictions.\nAvoidance of fines. Imports can be processed, relabeled, and repackaged in an FTZ before going through customs. This would help a company with potential product compliance problems to correct the violations before going through customs. The same conditions would apply for products that need to be inspected and tested prior to paying import duties.\n",

Classically, the product marketing strategy takes one of two approaches. In the first option, international marketers choose to follow a standardized approach by offering the same products, prices, advertising, promotions, distribution channels, and value-added services to all foreign market segments. This option is the less costly, as little or no modification is made to the product and global marketing strategy. On the other hand, marketers might pursue a customized approach in which the product and distribution support structure is tailored to meet the needs of local markets. Many international trading companies develop a strategy somewhere in between these two extremes, searching for ways to leverage the two approaches in an effort to optimize sales and profits while reducing costs.",

Another approach is to use the same product theme globally, but the content used is adapted to each market. An example is the use of women in advertising which can be radically different by country.

At the base of international pricing is the problem of price escalation. For example, a product made in the U.S. would sell in the domestic market for US$100, but in Europe the price might escalate to US$205. The difference between the two prices is the cost to the exporter for transportation, tariffs, importer margins, wholesale margins, and retailer margins above the factory cost. To solve this problem, exporters have three options. A company may, first of all, establish a uniform price for all markets. When pursuing this policy, all nations, whether rich or poor, would pay the same price. A second method would be to set a market-based price in each trading country. In this strategy, the firm would charge what each country could bear. Finally, a firm may pursue a cost-based price in each country. Selling price would be cost plus a standard markup.

Dumping occurs when a company charges less than cost or less than what it charges in the domestic market in order to enter or win a market. When such abuses are caught, various governments force the subsidiary to charge the arm\u2019s-length price or the same price as being charged by local competitors.

Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, but in the end the form of payment is determined by weighing the risk of not getting the sale versus the risk of nonpayment. Trade with high risk countries usually warrants less risky methods such as cash in advance or a bank letter of credit. Using such conservative methods, however, risks the potential of lost sales.\nCash in advance. In this method, the exporter requires payment in advance before shipment of the goods occurs. The transaction is performed by an electronic transfer of payment from the importer\u2019s to the exporter\u2019s bank. In this method, all of the risk is placed on the importer and is the recommended method when dealing with very risky trade transactions.\nOpen account. In this method, once the goods are shipped, the exporter sends an invoice to the importer. The exporter expects payment based on the accounts payable agreement executed between the two parties. The agreement will state such key provisions as number of days until past due, possible early payment discounts, cost of risk insurance, and possible interest charges on late payments. This form of payment is only used when the exporter has established a firm partnership and feels that there is minimal risk of nonpayment from the importer.\nLetter of credit. In this method, a bank in the importer\u2019s country issues a commercial letter assuring the exporter that the importer can make payment for the purchase of goods and that the bank will honor a draft issued by the importer up to that amount. The letter of credit is therefore a contractual agreement between the issuing bank and the exporter independent of the exporter/importer relationship. This means that the bank, if the importer is unable to pay, is contractually obliged to pay the exporter. There are three types of letter of credit:\nIrrevocable. This type of letter of credit cannot be canceled by the issuing bank without the consent of the exporter. Most letters of credit are executed as irrevocable.\nConfirmed irrevocable. In this situation, a foreign bank issues the letter of credit and it is guaranteed by a bank in the exporter\u2019s home country. The drawback of this option is that it is more expensive than an irrevocable letter of credit.\nRevocable. Normally, this letter of credit is really a pro-forma document to be used as a basis when preparing irrevocable letters of credit.\n\n",

Using the idea of the standard P-card used in domestic purchasing, a bank offers credit cards to be used by the importer. Similar to a consumer credit card, a procurement card allows an importer to make purchases directly with an exporter. When the transaction is completed, the bank immediately pays the exporter, minus a certain transaction percentage usually around 2 %. This method present a very low risk way of conducting international trade.\nDirect debiting. With the advent of the Internet and electronic networking, most global trade systems enable direct, electronic debiting of an importer\u2019s purchase and immediate payment into the accounts payable of the exporter. How the process works is when the shipment takes place, the exporter\u2019s accounts receivable module automatically debits the bank account of the importer, subject to the payables agreement executed between the two parties.

Transaction data used by the exporter, its vendors, LSPs, customers, and other trading partners flows through a central GTM platform. The flow of data, in turn, triggers other transactions and the system ensures each party receives the information it requires.

Functionality in this area provides capabilities focused on automating customs and regulatory compliance activities, such as product classification, restricted ship-to party screenings, and embargo checks, trade documents, calculation of total landed costs, assignment of export and import licenses, electronic communication with legal authorities, management of customs processes and transit procedures, and determination of preferential trade eligibility. A GTM can also help global traders profit from foreign trade agreements and FTZs, and participate in security programs such as C-TPAT.\nContent. This area is concerned with establishing accurate and complete trade content for every country a company trades with in order to successfully comply with trade regulations and prevent customs clearance delays. Such data include denied parties and embargoed countries; harmonized system chapters and descriptions; license codes, descriptions and requirements; document templates; and value-added tax, excise tax, and seasonal tax. Real-time databases of import duties, tariffs, and other charges, as well as exemptions, help shippers calculate complete landed costs. A GTM enables global traders to update the \u201ctrade content\u201d continuously, so that any time a shipper performs a transaction, the system applies the latest information automatically.\nConnectivity. Establishing and maintaining connectivity with trading partners, as well as keeping up with customs modernization efforts around the world, is a critical component of a GTM system. Because global trade involves multiple transportation modes, a GTM connects those modes so shippers know where their goods are and identifies and improves bottlenecks and finds cost reductions. With a complete picture of the global supply chain, global companies can better manage inventories. Many of today\u2019s GTM software vendors have solutions utilizing cloud computing; other vendors enable companies to host the system inside their firewalls.\nFinance. Global trade requires the effective management of transaction financing. A GTM must be able to create, present, and manage all documentation required for export and import letters of credit. For more advanced relationships, companies can use GTM functionality for open account payment methods to support international trade transactions. This method streamlines paperwork and documentation, automates invoice flows, and protects transactions from exceeding credit limits.\n",

An effective GTM system enables global traders to focus on these challenges by increasing overall supply chain efficiency. The following five essential advantages are provided by a GTM [24]:\nStreamlining the export management process. A GTM relieves global traders of the task of manually screening every order from an international customer to ensure the customer and associated parties are not on the sanctioned party lists of various governments and that they conform to export license requirements. GTM functionality instantly either clears or inhibits orders, preventing shippers from experiencing costly bottlenecks and delays in shipment.\nElimination of order processing delays. After order authorization, global shipments are subject to an array of documents that must be completed accurately and filed correctly. When it is considered that around 10 % of international orders are delayed due to documentation or license requirements errors, such delays can significantly affect delivery and customer satisfaction promises. An effective GTM enables shippers to notify customers of violations in a timely fashion and avoid potential fines due to non-compliance.\nVisibility to landed costs. GTM systems enable global traders to quickly and accurately determine shipment landed costs and to factor in decisions on product pricing, rebates, and discounts. A clear understanding of landed costs assists global companies to locate plants, production sites, and warehouses in countries where landed cost is lower due to smaller import duties on materials and finished goods.\nReduction of inbound shipment delays. By providing visibility to shipment status and ensuring the right documentation is prepared and ready, a GTM can assist in significantly lessening customs delays. In the very near term, this means importers can carry less inventory and still maintain targeted levels of customer service.\nStreamlining financial trade. A GTM facilitates the accurate and complete submission of financial instruments, such as Letter of Credit documents, thereby reducing payment delays and additional fees.\n",

By the 1980s, this central concern with cost reduction, a somewhat negative approach to foreign sourcing, began to be replaced by the realization that a number of dramatic changes in the global economy had altered the traditional view of international sourcing and ushered in the current era of globalization.

            "text": "There are many reasons for today\u2019s purchasing function to explore international sources of supply. Key sources of value-add are:\nAvailability. Due to the growth of foreign competition, many products that were once made domestically are now available only through international sources. Among such products are many electronic components, machine tools, capital equipment, specialty metals and alloys, and electromechanical equipment.\nQuality. Many buyers look to global sources for products that meet the levels of quality demanded by the marketplace. Although the quality and JIT/lean movements in U.S. manufacturing have enabled many domestic producers to quickly close past \u201cquality gaps,\u201d the lead in quality seized by some foreign companies provides buyers with little alternative but to purchase from them.\nTimeliness. As lean techniques and management styles continue to decrease inventories, the need for reliability in meeting schedule requirements correspondingly has grown in proportion. Many purchasers have had to import products from global companies who have developed philosophies, production, and delivery techniques focusing on 100 % customer satisfaction at significantly less-than domestic prices.\nContinuity of supply. Increased demand and competition for goods worldwide have made purchasers sharply aware of possible shortages in raw materials and finished components due to strikes, economic downturns, or even political unrest. Today\u2019s purchasers must be aware of and cultivate alternative sources of supply to ensure continuity of product availability.\nCost/price. Generally, foreign companies have been able to offer international buyers lower prices on goods because of lower material, labor, and overhead costs. This is particularly true of products, such as textiles, apparel, shoes, molds and dies, assembled components, and automobiles. Coupled with this advantage, some foreign producers also possess specialized skills, technologies, or patent rights that provide them with an overwhelming competitive advantage. In exploring cost advantages, buyers must be careful to calculate the total landed cost, including transportation, communication, import duties, source investigation and so forth, when pursuing global sourcing.\nTechnology. Many foreign nations have historically prided themselves on the high level of craftsmanship and quality that characterizes their products. Today, there are many foreign nations, particularly Japan, Germany, and China, which possess strong technology competencies in some industries comparable to U.S. companies who often are charging a higher price. Buyers who do not take advantage of this technological leadership to acquire high-quality products might find themselves losing to competitors that do. In addition, the strong technology competencies of some foreign companies may permit other firms to \u201cacquire\u201d the technology without investing in the development of the process itself. Importing the products of these technologies permits companies to remain focused on core competencies while leveraging imported components to offer to the market a wide variety of highly competitive products.\nMarket entry. Some nations require foreign exporters to also buy from their country, or have a certain percentage of the export product be produced from materials or components originating from the home country. International purchasing requires buyers to know the overall sources of products if they are to effectively procure components or finished goods in support of marketing, production, and sales plans.\n",

Countertrade links together two normally independent functions: the export of sold goods to a specific country and the import of purchased goods from the same country. Countertrade occurs for a number of reasons. For example, the importing country has balance-of-payments, currency exchange, or political restrictions preventing cash purchase. Sometimes this condition is imposed by governments in an effort to promote local products or to gain imports while also keeping currencies inconvertible. In this environment, countertrade provides certain advantages such as facilitating sales, expanding competition, improving profit potential, opening responsive markets, developing new capabilities, and retarding inflation. There are, however, drawbacks. It complicates purchasing, adds administrative costs, extends transportation time and cost, incurs duties and taxes, drains home technology resources, and imposes unfamiliar activities to be performed.",

The five major types of countertrade are:\nBarter. This is probably the oldest form of transaction. Barter is the direct exchange of goods or services or both between two parties without the exchange of cash. Problems with this type of countertrade are the normal lag in time before goods are fully received, the possibility that one party may receive goods they cannot use, or one party receives goods that are less than the expected value.\nCounter-purchase. Many times two companies will agree upon reciprocal buying arrangements. Both companies agree to buy the products of each, pay for the majority of their purchases in cash, and fulfill their mutual sales obligations within a specified time period.\nOffset. This type of countertrade is similar to counter-purchase. The difference is that some or 100 % of the counter-purchase obligation is offset by buying from any company in the foreign country. Offset countertrade agreements are normally executed with countries with centrally planned economies.\nCompensation or buy-back. In this type of countertrade a company agrees to build a plant or supply technology, equipment, and/or technical advice to a foreign country, and, in exchange, takes a percentage of the output from the facility as payment. Occidental Petroleum, for example, negotiated a US$20 million deal with Russia to build several plants there and receive ammonia over a 20-year period as partial payment. Normally, the host country receives ownership when the terms of the agreement are completed.\nSwitch-trading. This countertrade method utilizes a third-party trading house that buys the selling company\u2019s counter-purchase goods, services, or trade credits, and sells them to another company that requires them.\n",

This step could be undertaken for a variety of reasons: product unavailability in the domestic market, requirements for a higher level of quality than can be found from domestic suppliers, search for alternate suppliers other than domestic sources, and search for lower-cost alternatives. In addition, more detailed criteria, such as the length of the supply line, strategy for supplier partnership and involvement, stability of product design, completeness of engineering documentation, length of the product life cycle, superiority of production methods, necessary materials and tooling, and terms and conditions of contracts, are also critical criteria that must be determined ahead of any outsourcing negotiation.\n",

There are several strategies purchasers can use to counter currency fluctuations. The most radical approach is to insist that negotiation and payment be executed in the home currency. Another alternative is for buyer and seller to split fluctuations in value either 50/50 or by some other agreed upon formula. Many buyers will negotiate a price along with a variance, say of plus or minus 5 %. If the price exceeds the variance threshold, buyer and seller would equally share in the variance. Finally, some companies hedge currency fluctuations by purchasing fixed rates via currency futures or forward contracts [27].",

Although the normal planning activities associated with a negotiation, such as team membership, establishment of objectives, and issues up for compromise, are critical, purchasers must be prepared to tailor the process to meet the often very different practices and perceptions of foreign negotiators. One of the most critical decisions to be resolved during negotiations is shipping terms and method of payment. Most of the Incoterms\u00ae reviewed earlier in this chapter relating to exports (Table 14.2) also apply to product imports. Among the most common are FOB, Ex Works, FAS, CFR, CIF and DDP. Traditionally, a number of payment methods are used when transacting international trade including the following:\nCash in Advance. Often when buyers do not have a good credit rating or are unknown, or when the buyer\u2019s country is politically or economically unstable, sellers will require them to pay for purchased material in advance.\nOpen Account. Although this is the preferred method of payment for domestic business in the U.S., it is not often used in international purchasing. The reason stems mostly from the uncertainties in currencies and international political conditions.\nDrafts. This is currently the most widely used of the payment methods. A draft is a negotiable instrument that contains an order to pay. When a sale takes place, the seller forwards the transfer documentation and draft through its bank to the buyer\u2019s bank for payment. A sight draft is executed when the buyer pays the draft. A time draft requires that the buyer pay the draft on a specific due date. In a clean draft, the seller presents its draft to the buyer for collection and the transaction documents are delivered directly to the buyer.\nLetter of Credit. In this method, letters of credit are arranged by the buyer with a bank, and the supplier can draw payment against the credit with the submittal of the appropriate transaction documents.\n",

There are three major types of tariffs: ad valorem, specific, and compound. Ad valorem, the type of tariff most applied, is calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of the goods received. A specific tariff is defined as a specified amount per unit weight or other unit of measurement. For example, $0.20 per gross. Finally, a compound tariff is calculated as a combination of both an ad valorem and a specific rate. The payment of tariffs can be delayed by warehousing goods in a free-trade zone. Tariffs are not paid on the goods until they are removed from the free-trade zone and sold. Another method used by firms that re-export products is a duty drawback. The drawback provides for a 99 % refund of ordinary customs duties paid when the goods were originally received.",

The following represents the key purchasing import documents:\nArrival Notice. This document is sent by the carrier and informs the buyer of the estimated arrival date of the shipment, identifies the shipment with details such as number of packages and weight, and indicates when \u201cfree time\u201d will expire. The notice is often used as a freight bill.\nCustoms Entries. There are several different types of forms used when entering imported goods into the U.S. The first type, consumption entry, is required of all entering goods by U.S. Customs. The form contains information as to the origin of the cargo, a description of the merchandise, and estimated duties applicable to the particular commodity. Estimated duties must be paid when the entry is filed. The second type of entry form, an immediate delivery entry, is used to expedite the delivery of cargo. It allows up to 10 days for the payment of estimated duty and processing of the consumption entry. In addition, it permits delivery of the cargo prior to payment of the estimated duty and then allows subsequent filing of the consumption entry and duty. It is also known as \u201cI.D. entry.\u201d The third type of customs entry, immediate transportation entry, allows the cargo to be moved from the pier to an inland destination via a bonded carrier without the payment of duties or finalization of the entry at the port of arrival. It is also known as an \u201cI.T. entry.\u201d The final type of customs entry, transportation and exportation entry, permits goods coming from or going to a third country to enter the U.S. for the purpose of transshipment. It is also known as \u201cT&E entry.\u201d\nCarrier\u2019s Certificate and Release Order. This document is used to advise U.S. Customs of shipment details, ownership, port of lading, and other information. By means of this document, the carrier certifies that the company or individual named in the certificate is the owner or consignee of the cargo. It is commonly known as the \u201cCarrier Certificate.\u201d\nDelivery Order. This document is issued by the consignee or authorized customs broker to the ocean carrier providing authority to release the cargo to the inland carrier. It includes all data necessary for the pier delivery clerk to determine that the cargo can be released to the domestic carrier. This document is also known as a \u201cPier Release.\u201d\nFreight Release. This document provides evidence that the freight charges for the cargo have been paid. If in writing, it may be presented at the pier to obtain release of the cargo (Normally, once the freight is paid, releases are arranged without additional documentation). It is also known as a \u201cFreight Bill Receipt.\u201d\nSpecial Customs Invoice. This is an official form usually required by U.S. Customs where the rate of duty is based on shipment value exceeds $500. The document is usually prepared by the foreign exporter or authorized forwarder and is used by Customs in determining the value of the shipment. The exporter or designated agent must attest to the authenticity of the data furnished.\n",

This department can be organized several ways, including the use of a resident foreign purchasing office, import broker, merchant or international trading company, or formal structure within the corporate purchasing function. Third, the international purchasing organization needs to be closely integrated with other company and channel functions. This will assure that individual departmental objectives as well as the supply chain strategy are effectively supported.

Beyond fiscal concerns about product, pivotal to this strategy is the possession of viable transportation modes that span global boarders. To this end, governments will subsidize the growth of local carriers with international capabilities to ensure that as large a portion as possible of exports and imports are carried in home country transport modes. Also, nations sometimes have cargo preference laws requiring that certain types of goods can only be carried by domestic carriers.

Much of the world\u2019s total shipping tonnage is the transportation of petroleum.\nSeagoing barges.

When using this mode, shippers have the benefit of planning delivery almost anywhere in the world by consulting the published routes of commercial airlines. The second mode is a charter flight. Companies can charter an aircraft from a variety of private and commercial services. Although chartering an aircraft is expensive, it could be justified for the shipment of a product whose nature or demand requires extreme reduction in transit time over other forms of carriage. Theoretically, tariffs follow the guidelines established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a cartel consisting of almost all of the world\u2019s airlines. In practice, rates are based on the principle of charging what the market will bear. Tariffs are normally charged on the basis of volume or weight, whichever is higher.",

            "text": "International warehousing is divided into two basic categories. The first consists of a variety of different types of consolidation warehouse. These facilities are privately owned by the exporting firm or offered for public use by local LSP companies and are found at seaports, airports, and in most large cities. The basic purpose of consolidation warehousing is to receive foreign shipments and prepare them for the next leg through the home-country distribution channel as they move toward the end customer. The functions of international consolidation centers are similar to those performed by domestic counterparts. Operations may consist of such activities as bulk breaking, conversion of the shipment to other modal means of transport, repacking, labeling, and marking. Among this type of warehouse are the following:\nTransit Sheds. This is perhaps the most basic form of international warehousing. Transit sheds are normally enclosed facilities at piers used to temporarily store shipments. The shed provides sufficient protection against weather conditions and assists in organizing the shipment for the next carrier. Transit sheds usually contain cargo, such as containers and trailers that have been unloaded from an ocean vessel and are waiting to be loaded onto a rail or motor carrier.\nIn-Transit Storage. Often, international shippers need to temporarily store inventory while performing consolidation activities and negotiating rates with local carriers. In-transit storage warehousing provides this service. These warehouses are normally provided by the nation\u2019s railroad system and are located at seaports and airports.\nHold-on-Dock Storage. This type of storage is offered by ocean carriers who permit shippers to warehouse cargoes in their facilities, usually at no charge, until the next scheduled sailing. Often shippers take advantage of the free storage to warehouse goods and perform consolidation activities.\nPublic Warehousing. When shipments are delayed or held by the customer or government regulation, shippers may contract with a public warehouse to store the cargoes. Practically all international ports offer public warehousing to foreign shippers.\nShared Warehousing. It is not uncommon for foreign shippers to pool their resources and contract as a co-operative for public warehousing. This practice enables companies to retain public warehouse storage at lower costs.\nBonded Warehouse. This type of warehouse is operated under government customs supervision for the express purpose of storing imported goods. Bonded warehouses are owned directly by the government, by private companies for their imported goods only, or by public warehousing LSPs. All shipments to and from bonded warehouses are handled by government-licensed bonded carriers. While they are stored in a bonded warehouse, goods cannot be further processed or manufactured.\nForeign Trade Zones. As discussed earlier in this chapter, FTZs are a special type of warehouse in which imported goods are stored duty free until they are sold in the foreign market. In addition, goods marked for re-export do not pay any duties as long as they remain in the free-trade-zone location. While in storage, goods can be further processed or manufactured. Shippers must be thoroughly familiar with the regulations affecting both bonded and free-trade-zone warehouses [31].\n",

            "text": "The second category of international warehousing is privately owned warehousing. The decision criteria for building and maintaining a foreign warehouse is fairly close to that for owning a domestic warehouse. Criteria are divided into two sets of elements: macro and micro. Macro elements can be divided into five major factors.\nTransportation. One of the most critical factors when making a decision to locate a warehouse in a foreign country is the availability of local transportation. The site should provide easy access to foreign terminals, such as sea docks and airports. Also, the state of local land transportation is critical. Quality and accessibility of the road system, availability of local carriers, and ability to use a private fleet must be determined before site selection.\nLabor. Once a warehouse has been built, it will need to be staffed. Issues considered are the level of education and skill possessed by the local work force, requirements for training, ability to recruit local management, attitudes and customs of the local populace, and government restrictions and labor laws.\nLand. The property occupied by the warehouse must be thoroughly investigated. Key issues are ownership of the land, the existence of public services such as sewers, water, roads, refuse pick-up, police and fire protection, governmental construction requirements, terrain, and possibility for expansion.\nEnergy and utilities. A constant and uninterrupted source of power is crucial for effective warehouse operations. In countries where utilities are inadequate, companies may have to construct and operate their own power plants.\nTaxes and incentives. When looking for an off-shore warehouse site, companies often get local governments to assist in construction and operation, as well as to grant special tax breaks. The reverse can just as easily be the case, with some nations placing high taxes and restrictions on foreign operations in an endeavor to protect local businesses.\n",
