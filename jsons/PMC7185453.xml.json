Most patients present with newly developing or worsening respiratory symptoms over a period of 7 days. Severe acute respiratory failure manifests as respiratory distress with severe tachypnoea, laboured breathing, and recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles. Various patterns of pulmonary infiltrates might be seen, the most common of which are diffuse bilateral infiltrates.9 Patients with acute respiratory failure require oxygen therapy and most studies of acute respiratory failure included patients receiving \u22656 L/min of standard oxygen. However, depending on the country and number of available hospital beds, patients with acute respiratory failure can be managed on wards, in intermediate care units, or in intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, the need for ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or mortality increase with the required oxygen flow.10 Thus, for patients that require 6 L/min of standard oxygen or more, need for intubation throughout the ICU stay and mortality before hospital discharge are up to 40%.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality.13, 14, 17\n",

In this Review, we look at the epidemiology, outcomes, and diagnostic investigations in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, with emphasis on the broad range of causes that must be considered. We discuss the role for invasive and non-invasive tests in identification of the cause of acute respiratory failure, although the huge diversity of tests available for each cause, coupled with the scarcity of randomised controlled trials, creates major challenges. We also suggest an approach to the management of hypoxaemia based on the latest literature.",

Few studies have followed cohorts of patients with the main objective of collecting information about the incidence of pulmonary infiltrates or respiratory complications. Observational studies have shown that among haematological malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma) were associated with a moderate incidence of respiratory events (8\u201318%)18 compared with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (22\u201384%; table 1).19, 20, 38 Moreover, patients with prolonged neutropenia6 and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients24, 25, 26, 27 have higher incidences of respiratory events compared with other haematology patients. Solid tumours are associated with a lower incidence of respiratory events than haematological malignancies, with lung cancer having the highest rates (up to 50%), because endobronchial obstruction and atelectasis are risk factors for pneumonia.30 However, in patients with breast cancer treated with radiation and paclitaxel, the crude rate of pneumonitis was 14\u00b76% (95% CI 5\u00b76\u201329\u00b72).31 Of note, in patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy (mostly with programmed death 1 and programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors), the incidence of pneumonitis can reach 4%.32, 39 Acute respiratory failure occurs in about 5% of kidney transplant recipients and 12\u201314% of heart or lung transplant recipients.34, 36 Overall, mortality among patients with acute respiratory failure is about 50%, depending on the underlying condition, nature, severity, and course of the respiratory failure, need for IMV, and associated organ dysfunctions.13\n",

            "text": "Hypoxaemia is the hallmark of respiratory failure. The clinical signs and tolerance of hypoxaemia are usually a function of respiratory symptom duration. For instance, an acute hypoxaemic episode can lead to respiratory distress within a few hours, whereas a subacute or non-acute lung insult of similar magnitude can result in deep hypoxaemia without signs of respiratory distress. Overall, degree of hypoxaemia reflects the extent of lung involvement. Hypoxaemia, measured directly as the PaO2 on room air or assessed on the basis of the oxygen flow needed to achieve an peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% or the estimated or calculated ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), has been used for many years to risk-stratify patients and guide ICU admission decisions. Increased oxygen flow has been associated with the need for ICU admission,10 need for IMV,10, 16 and hospital mortality.17 Similarly, lower PaO2/FiO2 has been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,40 the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV),41 or failure of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO).42 Persistent tachypnoea has also been associated with failure of standard oxygen,42 NIV,41 or high-flow nasal cannula, requiring the implementation of another strategy (eg, intubation).43 No study has evaluated the impact of hyperoxygenation in this setting.44 Associated organ dysfunctions are best depicted by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which has consistently been identified as a determinant of mortality, with higher scores associated with increased mortality.5, 13, 45 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality in immunocompromised patients,14 particularly in those with acute respiratory failure.10, 13, 17 Benefits from earlier ICU admission might be the result of the careful clinical assessment, optimal oxygenation strategy, avoidance of potentially harmful investigations, and selection of the least invasive diagnostic tests in ICUs. The characteristics of the underlying immunosuppressive condition are not usually associated with hospital mortality following ICU admission,46 although variations occur depending on ICU admission policies. A higher proportion of patients admitted to ICU with do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate status results in stronger associations between variables reflecting characteristics of disease status and mortality.47, 48 Performance status and comorbidities have been associated with increased mortality.13, 14, 49, 50 The effects of initial oxygenation and ventilation strategy on mortality are discussed later in this Review. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, several studies have assessed the association between the cause of acute respiratory failure and mortality. Mortality is lowest in patients with cardiac pulmonary oedema and highest in those with invasive fungal infections or no identified cause of acute respiratory failure.",

            "text": "One of the first and key steps in the early management of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure is to establish the probable cause of acute respiratory failure, at the bedside, based on clinical examination before undertaking tests. No standard combination therapy is suitable for all patients with acute respiratory failure; each patient must be considered individually. Clinicians should make every effort to identify the cause of acute respiratory failure in patients at high risk of intubation and mortality (eg, those with a higher SOFA score or more hypoxaemic). Bacterial infection is the main cause of acute respiratory failure, and up to 90% of patients receive antibacterial drugs soon after admission.9 Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema must be considered in every patient. However, other diagnoses should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the basic diagnostic investigation is the same for all patients (panel 1\n). It includes tests for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, sputum examination, and blood cultures to detect bacterial or fungal infections, induced sputum examination for Pneumocystis, viral multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, viral PCR on plasma or blood, an assessment of the likelihood that the underlying condition and its treatments will affect the lungs, and an analysis of the imaging data.Panel 1Basic diagnostic investigations to be applied to all immunocompromised patients presenting with acute respiratory failureTests to diagnose or rule out cardiogenic pulmonary oedema\n\u2022Echocardiography\u2022Biomarkers such as natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide could be used in the emergency department to rule out cardiogenic pulmonary oedema for their good negative predictive value\nSputum examination to detect bacterial (and mycobacterial) infectionsBlood cultures to detect bacterial or fungal infectionsUrine antigen for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae\n\n\u2022Induced sputum examination for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

In patients with myeloproliferative diseases such as acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukaemia, most cases of acute respiratory failure that occur early after disease onset are related to leukaemic infiltrates (figure 1\n), although some patients might present with pneumonia or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.20, 53, 54 Acute respiratory failure of infectious origin is, however, more common at the earliest phase of lymphoproliferative disorders (figure 1), such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma.21, 55 In patients with T-cell proliferations, opportunistic infections have been reported before cancer treatment initiation, exemplifying the role played by disease-related immunosuppression.56 Later, during follow-up, infection is the main cause (figure 1), although treatment-related toxicities and disease relapse can also lead to acute respiratory failure. Clinicians can struggle with non-infectious causes whose diagnosis is believed to rely solely on biopsies, which are difficult to obtain in hypoxaemic patients with thrombocytopenia and haemostatic disorders, or on bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, and have been reported as possibly deteriorating the respiratory status and increasing IMV needs. However, a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach allows earlier recognition of typical patterns of clinical and laboratory findings, for which no additional diagnostic procedures are needed (lung infiltration by the underlying condition, leukaemic infiltrates in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, cytarabine-related pulmonary toxicity, immunotherapy-related pneumonitis, etc). Patients with these patterns are often considered to have no known cause of acute respiratory failure until a multidisciplinary team makes the appropriate diagnosis. Similarly, conditions such as neutropenia or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation are associated with both a high risk of respiratory events and specific acute respiratory failure causes such as exacerbation of previous lung injury during neutropenia recovery,57 or non-infectious interstitial lung diseases following haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.26, 58\n",

Patterns of lung involvement are an important piece of the puzzle but are not predictive of a specific cause.69 However, a combination of positive and negative high-resolution CT findings suggest specific causes of lung infiltrates.70 Different components of the DIRECT mnemonic contribute to determining the pre-test clinical probability for each individual diagnosis (figure 3\n).

Performing bronchoalveolar lavage with the support of NIV or high-flow nasal cannula can help patients tolerate the procedure. Also, first-line bronchoalveolar lavage must be considered in situations in which patients have a possible diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, or drug-related pulmonary toxicity, or when lung infiltrates might be involved in the underlying disease (vasculitis, lymphoma, etc). The diagnostic yield of non-invasive tests has, however, increased since the introduction of more sensitive diagnostic tests, such as PCR. However, these tests are more sensitive than specific, and the clinical relevance of a positive PCR is sometimes uncertain. In patients with cancer, the standard diagnostic investigation done immediately at ICU admission includes a physical examination, a pre-test probability assessment using DIRECT, sputum (if possible) and induced sputum examinations, nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, blood cultures, serum and urine antigen assays, imaging studies, and biomarker assays. These non-invasive tests perform as well as bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage.9, 71 In solid organ transplant recipients, however, bronchoalveolar lavage has a higher diagnostic yield,36 although the risk\u2013benefit ratio has not been assessed in this population. Moreover, with the advent of omics to assist in the diagnosis of infections,72 as well as sophisticated immunology and molecular biology methods and advances in imaging techniques to establish the diagnosis of non-infectious conditions, a reappraisal of the diagnostic yield of non-invasive tests in immunocompromised patients is warranted.",

The association might be related in part to patients who die within a few hours with intractable hypoxaemia and multiple organ dysfunction before diagnostic tests can be performed.

Overall, lung biopsy had a diagnostic yield above 60%, with complications in 10% of patients, despite careful patient selection for the procedure. Lung biopsy had a lower diagnostic yield in patients receiving IMV. Invasive fungal infections and malignant or potentially steroid-sensitive lung infiltrates were the most common causes of acute respiratory failure (table 4). The diagnostic yield of surgical lung biopsy for unexplained pulmonary infiltrates was assessed in a retrospective study of 62 haematology patients.95 The exact diagnosis was established in 67% of patients, with invasive aspergillosis and malignancy being the main causes. The biopsy result prompted a treatment change in 40% of patients, and complications occurred in 11% of patients. The diagnostic yield was lower in patients with acute respiratory failure who were receiving IMV at the time of biopsy than in non-intubated patients. In a cohort of 63 haematology patients, the diagnostic yield of lung biopsy was 62% and the therapeutic yield 57%.73 The diagnostic yield was lower in patients on IMV and in those with neutropenia, but was higher in patients with focal infiltrates. Invasive aspergillosis was also a common biopsy finding in this study. Complications occurred in 13% of patients.73 The 15% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is in line with data on acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with cancer40 and with autopsy findings in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.90 In 21 haematology patients, including 10 in whom the lung biopsies were obtained post-mortem, inflammatory and malignant infiltrates were the most common diagnoses.85 A retrospective autopsy study of 7 haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients showed that fungal infections, potentially steroid-responsive lung involvement, and malignant infiltrates were underdiagnosed.96 Complications associated with lung biopsies occurred in about 10% of patients who were highly selected based on platelet count, performance status, and goals of care. Given the lower diagnostic yield of lung biopsy in ICU patients, the risk\u2013benefit ratio is not favourable; therefore, lung biopsy is rarely performed in critically ill immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure and lung infiltrates of unknown cause. However, minimally invasive CT-guided lung biopsies and transbronchial cryobiopsies are increasingly done.88, 89, 92, 93, 97, 98 Studies to assess the timing of these minimally invasive diagnostic techniques in this setting are warranted. The diagnostic yield should be better defined as the identification of a new diagnosis that was not detected by any other less invasive technique and that resulted in a change in treatment. Moreover, the risk\u2013benefit ratio needs to be re-assessed. If these minimally invasive biopsy techniques are evaluated in a randomised controlled trial, control patients should receive empirical treatment for the most common lung biopsy diagnoses, namely, invasive fungal infection or steroid-responsive lung disease (panel 2\n).Panel 2Unresolved issues and future directions in acute respiratory failure in patients with solid or haematological malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients taking immunosuppressive drugs\nUpdate data on the prevalence of pulmonary involvement in immunocompromised patients\n\n\u2022Develop and implement multinational patient registries\u2022Analyse the severe forms of drug-related toxicity from targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and other new drugs\u2022Collect longer-term follow-up data to assess the true morbidity of acute respiratory failure\n\nDefine the best standard of care for immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure\n\n\u2022Monitor times to intensive care unit (ICU) admission, to treatment implementation, and to diagnosis\u2022Manage respiratory failure and associated organ dysfunctions according to the latest guidelines\u2022Find a balance between aggressive and non-beneficial care, and implement full-code intensive care in patients with a substantial hope of survival\n\nEducate all stakeholders to avoid delays in ICU management\n\n\u2022Provide information on outcomes according to oxygen needs\u2022Explain how delayed ICU admission leads to increased mortality\u2022Encourage clinicians to assess the pre-test probability of each acute respiratory failure cause and start the corresponding treatments early\n\nDevelop a minimal early diagnostic investigation that applies to all patients, combined with targeted diagnostic strategies for patients at risk for specific diseases\n\n\u2022Search for bacterial and fungal infections (sputum examination, blood cultures), viral infection (multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs), and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema; evaluate the extent to which the underlying condition and its treatments may affect the lungs; obtain imaging data in all patients\u2022Apply specific clinical algorithms and perform targeted non-invasive or minimally invasive diagnostic tests in patients at risk for specific diseases (Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, mycobacterial disease, etc)\u2022Identify situations in which more invasive tests may be required\n\nEvaluate omics technologies on non-invasive samples\n\n\u2022Apply genomics, metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics on samples that can be collected easily from patients with tachypnoea and hypoxaemia\u2022Use clinical algorithms and evaluate their ability to confirm the diagnosis in high-risk patients or to rule out the diagnosis in low-risk patients\u2022Assess whether the use of these technologies can result in improved clinical outcomes\n\nProvide convincing data regarding the superiority of non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy\n\n\u2022When standard oxygen alone alleviates respiratory distress and maintains SpO2 \u226595%; or when standard oxygen fails to achieve these clinical goals\u2022Clarify whether patients who are intubated after failed non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy would have had better outcomes if they had received earlier intubation and lung-protective ventilation\u2022Define consensual intubation criteria, as the need for invasive mechanical ventilation is an important outcome measure\n\nDevelop a multinational network to improve the management of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure\n\n\u2022To define a non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic strategy that is readily feasible at many locations and to demonstrate, using cohort studies and randomised controlled trials, how this strategy translates into improved outcomes\u2022To validate clinical algorithms that help identify patients at low vs high risk for a given disease\u2022To develop and implement multicentre basic and translational research\u2022To promote education, update guidelines, and establish patient-centred outcome measures\n",

Priority has, therefore, been given to avoidance of IMV by use of non-invasive oxygenation or ventilation devices (figure 6\n). However, failure of NIV13, 41, 100 or HFNO13 was associated with higher mortality,13 and two older studies even suggested that early IMV was associated with improved survival.101, 102 Furthermore, because respiratory disease severity or associated organ dysfunctions are usually worse in intubated patients, determining whether the excess mortality in patients on IMV is due to the IMV itself or to the greater severity of the acute illness is difficult. In other words, a focus on avoiding intubation might not be effective, because the need for IMV might identify a group of patients with high disease severity.",

Another seminal trial in solid organ transplant recipients103 also documented NIV benefits, but these results were obtained within 3 weeks following surgery. The European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society guidelines have been challenged by recent findings. A multicentre, randomised controlled trial in 374 patients in 28 centres in France and Belgium compared NIV with oxygen.11 This trial showed neither benefits nor harms from NIV, in sharp contrast with a post-hoc analysis of the trial by Frat and colleagues,12 which compared outcomes in 82 immunocompromised patients treated with HFNO, NIV, or standard oxygen. In this trial, the IMV and mortality rates were higher in the NIV group compared with the HFNO and standard oxygen groups. These results are consistent with studies reporting an increased risk of failure and mortality in patients receiving NIV for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.41, 75, 79 Thus, these data raise concerns about the use of NIV in immunocompromised patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure.",

In a retrospective cohort of 178 patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure,112 76 (43%) patients received NIV plus HFNO, 74 (42%) NIV plus standard oxygen, 20 (11%) HFNO alone, and 8 (4%) standard oxygen alone. The combination of NIV and HFNO was associated with lower mortality rates (37% vs 52% in the other patients, p=0\u00b704) and was independently associated with higher day-28 survival. In a post-hoc analysis of data from the iNVIctus randomised controlled trial of early NIV in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure,11 neither the intubation rate nor day-28 mortality differed significantly between the HFNO arm and the standard oxygen arm.113 In the post-hoc analysis of the trial by Frat and colleagues,12 outcomes were compared across standard oxygen, NIV, and HFNO. Although NIV was associated with increased need for intubation and higher mortality, neither parameter differed significantly between the 30 patients assigned to standard oxygen and the 26 patients assigned to HFNO. In a retrospective study of 115 immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure,81 the proportion of patients that required intubation (55% vs 35%) and mortality (40% vs 20%) were higher with NIV than with HFNO. In the Efraim multicentre, multinational, prospective cohort study of 1611 immunocompromised patients,13 915 patients were not intubated on ICU admission and received standard oxygen, HFNO, NIV, or NIV plus HFNO. Hospital mortality was not affected by the initial oxygenation or ventilation management. There was a non-significant trend towards reduced intubation in patients given HFNO. In a retrospective study of 38 kidney recipients,80 the number of ventilator-free days on day 28 was significantly higher in the HFNO group than in the NIV group. The results of two trials of HFNO focusing specifically on immunocompromised adults with acute respiratory failure (NCT02739451 and NCT02978300) are expected to be available in a few months.82 HFNO has not yet been properly evaluated regarding its ability to assist diagnostic procedures such as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial or transbronchial biopsies.",

            "text": "In summary, acute respiratory failure is a common and often fatal event in immunocompromised patients that raises major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In the near future, with the use of more intensive therapeutic regimens designed to cure cancer, induce transplant tolerance, or control autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in ever older and frailer patients, the incidence of acute respiratory failure against a background of immunodeficiency can be expected to increase. Moreover, the expanding use of targeted therapies and immunotherapies will lead to a growing burden of toxicity and infection during the increasing life spans of these populations. Our knowledge of the effects of acute respiratory failure needs to be improved by longer-term follow-up studies. Multinational registries must be developed to analyse the effect of new drugs and update clinicians on future trends in the incidence of acute respiratory failure and in the use of intensive care for patients with acute respiratory failure. Targets for improving survival, such as early ICU admission and the early identification or treatment of the cause of acute respiratory failure, require evaluation in large randomised controlled trials. Patients with substantial life expectancy and who agree to undergo ICU management should be offered unrestricted access to diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The greatest challenges are the identification of patients at high risk for specific diagnoses, earlier treatment of acute respiratory failure causes, and selection of the least invasive diagnostic tests. The non-invasive approach is promising but still needs to be refined and updated. Combining clinical algorithms and sophisticated tests, such as genomics, metagenomics, proteomics, or transcriptomics, on non-invasive samples to document or rule out infections will be a major advance only if the results include survival benefits, shorter ICU and hospital stay lengths, reduced costs, and improved patient-reported outcomes. Given that the initial oxygenation and NIV strategy is unlikely to be associated with survival, assessing the patient's response to standard oxygen, HFNO, or NIV within 1\u20134 h following ICU admission might be the best approach. Patients who improve, whether quickly or slowly, can then be differentiated from those with persistent tachypnoea, high respiratory drive, and increasing oxygen needs, for whom avoiding late intubation might have lung-protective effects.",

Low-flow oxygen systems comprise a nasal cannula (or nasal catheters; A) providing supplemental oxygen at flows below the total minute ventilation, leading to oxygen dilution with ambient air and lowering the inspired oxygen concentration. A standard nasal cannula delivers an inspiratory FiO2 of 0\u00b724\u20130\u00b744 at supply flows 1\u20138 L/min, depending on respiratory rate and tidal volume. A humidification device is recommended for flows >4 L/min. Reservoir masks (B) can deliver FiO2 values of 0\u00b740\u20130\u00b760 at 5\u201310 L/min. The reservoir system (\u223c100\u2013300 cm3) stores oxygen. A flow rate >5 L/min must be set to ensure the washout of exhaled gas and avoid CO2 retention. The non-rebreathing facemask (C) may deliver up to 0\u00b790 FiO2 at flow settings >10 L/min. It should be used only for short periods, as humidification is difficult and there is also a risk of CO2 retention if the mask's reservoir bag is allowed to collapse on inspiration. Lastly, the Venturi system (D) mixes oxygen with room air (humidification is not necessary) and provides an accurate and constant FiO2 despite variations in respiratory rate and tidal volume. It is employed when concern arises about CO2 retention or when the respiratory drive is inconsistent. High-flow oxygen therapy through nasal prongs or cannulas (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy; E) supplies an exact FiO2 (up to 1) at a flow equal to or greater than the patient's inspiratory flow demand. Nasal oxygen is administered at a flow rate of up to 60 L/min. It is warmed to body temperature and saturated to full humidity by molecular humidification. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation provides ventilator support without an endotracheal tube, using an oronasal (F) or total face (G) mask or a helmet (H). The main non-invasive ventilation mode used in hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is pressure support; continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure are used less often. Finally, invasive mechanical ventilation (I) uses a tracheal tube inserted into the trachea under general anaesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a ventilator. In patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are used after failure of standard oxygen and, in some cases, of the aforementioned non-invasive options.
