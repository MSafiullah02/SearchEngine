On a systems level, teams of neurosurgeons have been re-deployed as intensivists, neurosurgical patients have been re-housed in COVID-clean wards, protocols have been implemented to test patients ahead of neurosurgical procedures, and hospital systems have been reorganized to \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d configurations to segregate neurosurgery to designated centers [4\u20136].",

As hospitals tried to conserve precise resources for the tsunami of patients, governments worked to protect uninfected citizens, and medical societies strived to support physicians and nurses, neurosurgeons have been mandated to drastically alter their practices as the entire world mobilized to combat SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, 2020, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) issued an unprecedented recommendation to \u201cminimize, postpone or cancel electively scheduled operations\u201d [7]. As COVID-19 cases skyrocketed in the USA that week, the American Hospital Association and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quickly followed the ACS and issued similar recommendations [8\u201310]. Intuitively rational, medically sound, and worded respectful of the decision-making skills well-honed over decades of training, these recommendations nonetheless confounded neurosurgeons as they left the definition of \u201celective\u201d to each individual practitioner.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide. To care for the massive numbers of COVID patients, many hospital systems and surgeons are focused on conserving resources by limiting elective surgical procedures. During this study, conducted during the peak of the pandemic in Western Europe, we sought to determine how COVID-19 has disrupted the practice of neurosurgeons globally and affected the decision-making in triaging neurosurgical cases. A majority of respondents reported that all elective cases and clinics were re-scheduled. Government policy for strict social distancing and higher number of COVID-19 cases were predictors of hospital policy and neurosurgeons\u2019 views on canceling cases, while \u201cfor-profit\u201d practices and neurosurgeons in LMIC were less likely to experience strict hospital mandates for postponement. The survey responses to non-emergent case scenarios were used to develop an acuity index, which indicated that neuro-oncology cases, as well as select vascular cases, have high acuity. A strategic scheme was created as a possible guideline for sensible triaging of non-emergent neurosurgical cases, so that global neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without harming them either neurologically through delaying surgery, or by unnecessarily exposing them to the deadly virus at the pinnacle of the COVID tide.",
