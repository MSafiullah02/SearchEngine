Overall, infections were a primary or contributing COD in more than half of the patients who died in the follow\u2010up period. At present, the largest published report of infectious complications in patients undergoing haplo\u2010HCT was by Crocchiolo et al.8, who analyzed a cohort of 70 patients. The majority (94%) received BM grafts. They observed the established progression of infectious agents during traditional periods of risk. Bacterial infections peaked in the pre\u2010engraftment period at a rate of approximately 11 per 1000 patient\u2010days. Viral infections were most prominent in the early post\u2010engraftment period, occurring at a rate of 15 per 1000 patient\u2010days.8 We observed a slightly higher rate of early bacterial infection and a markedly higher rate of early viral infections (Figure 2A). Of note, patients reported by Crocchiolo et al.8 received routine bacterial prophylaxis with levofloxacin, whereas ours did not. Our median time to neutrophil engraftment was shorter (17 vs 20 days). This difference may have skewed the attribution of infections into the \u201cpre\u2010engraftment\u201d period, despite neutrophil recovery. In particular, a large number of viral infections occurred after neutrophil engraftment but before day 30 (Figure 2A vs B). Our observed rate of IFI and increased early CMV reactivation is consistent with previous literature comparing PBSC and BM grafts.9, 10 We also observed a high incidence of early neutropenic fever in our cohort.

However, early CMV reactivation and higher rates of reactivation and disease in patients receiving PBSC grafts were reported by Guerrero et al.9, who analyzed a cohort of MRD patients randomized to PBSC or BM grafts. They found altered prevalence and proliferation of CMV\u2010specific CD4+ cells following G\u2010CSF mobilization. Compared to previously published data in BM haplo\u2010HCT, the rate of CMV viremia associated with previous donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity and CMV disease were considerably higher (76% vs 54%, 12% vs 4%).8 The rate of CMV viremia among seropositive recipients was similar to another cohort of PBSC haplo\u2010HCT patients (90% vs 79%), although the incidence of CMV disease was considerably higher (12% vs 0%).12 The association of early viremia and recipient CMV pre\u2010transplant seropositivity with CMV disease is consistent with altered CMV immunity in this setting and may indicate the need for an alternative approach to treatment of CMV viremia in this population.

First, by excluding suspected infections that were not microbiologically confirmed, we underestimate the true incidence of infection in our population. Febrile episodes with no identified organism are a common occurrence in this population.33 Furthermore, many patients with suspected pneumonia cannot undergo bronchoscopy owing to thrombocytopenia. However, by employing strict criteria, our results are more specific than relying on retrospective clinical judgment. Second, our study did not include a comparison group. This makes contextualizing the reported rates of infection more difficult, especially given regional variations in some pathogens. However, it also allows us to provide an extremely broad and comprehensive description of the infectious experience within this novel cohort. Pathogen\u2010specific comparative studies are a direction of future research and may help illuminate differences in immune reconstitution following haplo\u2010HCT when compared to more traditional donors. Third, we were limited to collecting data from our own medical records system. Generally, patients receive all transplant\u2010related care at our institution. In the case of acute illness, some patients likely received treatment closer to home and these episodes would not be captured in this study. However, these patients are usually transferred to our institution when hospitalized and most data should be captured.
