Here, we explored epidemiologic profile of causative pathogens and possible factors for exacerbation in a single center over a three-year period. Methods: Hospitalized asthmatic children with attack aged 6 months-17 years were recruited between 2012 and 2015 (n = 216). Nasopharyngeal mucosa cell samples were collected from the participants and examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus (EV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and others. Clinical features, laboratory data, asthma exacerbation intensity, and asthma severity were compared among participants. Epidemiologic profile of causative pathogens and possible factors for exacerbation were explored.",

The median age at admission in the RV group was significantly higher than that in the RSV group. Insufficient asthma control and allergen sensitization were significantly related to RV-associated asthma exacerbation. There was no seasonality of pathogen types associated with asthma exacerbation although a sporadic prevalence of EV-D68 was observehinovirud.

In our study, RV infections were not seen in six non-attack asthmatic patients, mentioning the existence of RV in nasopharyngeal airway could be pathogenic for asthma exacerbation (data not shown).Several lines of evidence indicate that RV-induced wheezing illnesses in the first few years of life are closely associated with the risk of subsequent asthma. 1,3 We postulated the possibility that this close association could be ascribed to not only RV infection in itself but also repetitive RV infection inducing wheezing illnesses or asthma exacerbations.The unprecedented outbreak of EV-D68 infection in the autumn of 2014 that led to an upsurge in hospitalization and admission to intensive care units has raised a concern about a potential uncontrollable epidemic of severe respiratory disease26 ; we have therefore evaluated the relationship between hospital admission due to asthma exacerbation and infection with EV-D68.
