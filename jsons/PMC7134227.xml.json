            "text": "Generally, patients have a higher probability of recovery from chronic ailments if they keep to agreed medication schedules as prescribed by medical practitioners [1]. An optimal level of positive adherence behaviour is difficult to attain in low resource settings and rural areas due to many socio-economic problems. So far, several adherence-monitoring technologies such as Direct Observation Therapy (DOT), Video Observation Therapy (VOT), Indirect Monitoring Technology (Patient-facilitated or Device-facilitated), and Direct Monitoring Technology are being used to monitor adherence [2, 3]. However, these methods have not yielded maximum improvement in treatment outcomes because of the challenges of medication adherence particularly associated with older people, and persons in rural settings [4]. The socio-economic challenges of people in the rural setting ranging from poverty, illiteracy, poor infrastructure, shortage of good medical facilities, and medical experts make it difficult for healthcare organisations to effectively monitor medication adherence of patients in these settings and to motivate them for good adherence behaviour. Generally, existing methods have failed to embrace a multiple stakeholder approach that can encourage the patient towards positive adherence during the treatment journey [3]. There is also a lack of consideration for the dynamics of the everyday life of a patient, which could affect adherence behaviour. A patient is adjudged to have negative adherence behaviour if there is no consistency in the timing, dosage, and frequency of taking medication, or there is an outright disregard for the agreed medication schedule. However, irregular adherence behaviour could be due to challenges of work, home, and other circumstances that obstruct a patient\u2019s normal schedule. The existing adherence monitoring methods have failed to include critical human factors such as motivation, encouragement, negotiation, and flexibility that recognise the dynamics of everyday life of a patient into the design of their medication adherence monitoring scheme, which limits their patient-centeredness. These adherence monitoring approaches have not made adherence improvement an integral part of their design in a way that is supportive of the patient. This paper presents the conceptual overview of a governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement that will enable the collaboration of multiple stakeholders and data analytics (MUCODAF) to ensure that good decisions are made by the healthcare organisations when dealing with patients with different observed levels of medication adherence.",

The composition of the framework is based on the integration of cloud computing, wearable sensors, mobile technology, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data analytics. The governance framework creates a basis for intelligent and data-driven decision making by allowing relevant messages to be sent to the stakeholders from time to time based on the signals received from the wearable sensor device. Also, the post-analysis report of patients\u2019 adherence behaviours can be generated weekly by the healthcare workers (HCW) in healthcare organisations, which will provide a basis to determine the right strategy to deal with individual patients based on their identified adherence behaviours.",

            "text": "Adherence monitoring approaches can be categorised into direct monitoring methods, and indirect monitoring methods. Direct monitoring methods involve directly observing the patient as the drug is taken or immediately by testing the body fluid of the patient in the laboratory. Indirect monitoring entails the use of technology devices for tracking activities that could signal when a patient has taken the drug or not. Many indirect adherence monitoring methods are device-facilitated by using various technologies [3, 4]. Device-facilitated measuring can be classified into various categories such as sensor-based systems, proximity-based systems, vision-based systems, and fusion-based systems [4]. The sensor-based system can be classified into three sub-classes, which are smart pill containers, wearable sensors, and ingestible biosensors. The use of smart pill containers entails the detection of cap opening and bottle pick up to track adherence. Examples of these type of initiatives include Wisepills [5], Memscap [6], GlowCap [3, 7], Evrimed [8], and Amiko [9]. Wearable sensors detect motions related to cap twisting, hand-to-mouth, pouring the pill into the hand, and pill swallowing. Neck-worn sensors [10, 11], and wrist-worn sensors (in the form of smartwatches) [12\u201314] have been used to track medication adherence.",

Currently, the use of ingestible biosensors has proved to be the most accurate, however, many patients will not find it convenient to ingest a biosensor so that they can be tracked to determine if they have taken their medication or not [3, 15, 17]. Proximity-based systems are non-invasive systems that detect medication presence or absence within the proximity of a reader\u2019s antenna by using computer vision technology. Vision-based systems detect medication presence or absence within the scope of the camera, while fusion-based systems try to verify the operation of monitoring the medication-taking activity [4]. All of these methods have been found to perform creditably well in tracking medication adherence with different levels of accuracy, but they are strictly medication adherence monitoring methods. They did not include medication adherence improvement as an integral part of their design as envisioned by our proposed framework in a way that offers support to the patient for improved adherence behaviour.",

Disease such as Cancer, Tuberculosis, HIV, and Diabetes are prominent in developing countries where this kind of governmental and external support for patients will be useful.

The smartwatch is paired with the smartphone of the patient via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity to ensure that information is sent regularly to a cloud database via Wi-Fi or 2G/3G/4G data transmission. Adherence information is stored locally on the smartphone until a period when the patient has access to WiFi or mobile data when the stored information is transferred into the cloud. Medication adherence tracking with smartwatch will be done by sensing the Near Field Communication (NFC) tag on the drug casing. When the patient opens the drug box, he receives a message asking to confirm if he has taken his drug, if the reply is a yes, the event is recorded as an instance of positive adherence. A timestamped record of the event is stored on his phone for subsequent transfer to the cloud database. From the stored data, a patient supporter who is co-monitoring the adherence of the patient receives a message that the patient has taken his drug for that day. At the end of the week, the patient supporters (stakeholder, HCW, etc.) also get an adherence activity report via the mobile app/email/WhatsApp on the level of adherence of the patient in terms of compliance with the prescribed/agreed medication schedule for that week. Negotiation comes in when a patient requests an adjustment to a previously agreed schedule due to changes in his daily activities which may affect his adherence to an existing schedule. A patient can request adjustment of an existing medication schedule by sending a message to the HCW from the mobile app. Once a negotiated and revised schedule has been approved for the patient, it then becomes the basis for monitoring the patient\u2019s adherence by all stakeholders. A cloud-based central coordinating service ensures that information on a patient\u2019s adherence is sent through various channels such as SMS, WhatsApp, or email depending on the preferred mode of communication of a patient supporter. The patient supporter will use the available information on the adherence behaviour of a patient to determine how best to support the patient by way of encouragement, advice, or commendation to improve the level of adherence. The patient supporter is also able to contact the HCW when it is deemed necessary.",

The only concern is the need to ensure that the devices are charged regularly.

Mr. T has been enrolled for TB treatment for six months in the local hospital in Botha Bothe and he is expected to take his medication twice a day at 6 h interval. Mr. T has agreed with the healthcare worker that he will take his drug at 7 am every morning and at 1 pm during the lunch break while at work, and maintain the same schedule on non-work days. The medication schedule was agreed with the healthcare worker in the presence of the wife of Mr. T (Mrs. T) and Joe, who is a close friend and associate of Mr. T at work. Mrs. T and Joe have been enrolled as co-monitors and patient supporters to aid Mr. T in the aspect of adherence to the agreed schedule. A challenge with Mr. T is that lunch breaks at work do vary at times depending on the work schedule. For example, there are times when Mr. T and his colleagues need to spend longer periods in the mine, which would require that lunchtime be postponed until a later time.",

The coordination service should be able to send messages to a patient through a wearable device (smartwatch, smartphone) when it is required, and periodically to all the patient supporters (stakeholders). With this in place, the following scenario can then be realized [18]:The smartwatch device alerts Mr. T 15 min to the time when his drug is due to be taken.At the specified time, the smartwatch starts to make an alarm sound.The smartwatch tracks the medication adherence event by sensing the NFC (Near Field Communication) tag on the drug casing and prompts Mr. T if indeed he has taken his drug.If Mr. T answers in the affirmative, then data consisting of the time when the drug was taken, location, date, and a score that is indicative of a positive adherence behaviour of Mr. T (\u201cYes\u201d \u2013 positive; \u201cNo\u201d - negative) is stored in the cloud database. If there is internet connectivity the data is sent directly to the cloud through the local IoT hub. If there is no connectivity, the data is stored temporarily on Mr. T\u2019s smartphone, and sent subsequently to the cloud (this is because the patient\u2019s smartphone that has been paired with the wearable smartwatch via BLE).A reminder message is sent to Mr. T. via his smartphone and smartwatch every 10 min within 30 min from when he is supposed to have taken his medication to motivate him to take his medication according to the current medication schedule. If a message of positive adherence is not received 45 min after the expected time, then a conclusion of nonadherence is made by the system.A daily report that conveys the adherence behaviour of Mr. T (positive/negative) is sent to Mrs. T, Joe, and HCW. The HCW receives a more detailed report that shows the specific time, date, and place when the drug was taken, and times when medications were missed.Mr. T. is allowed to change the time of his medication (possibly due to work-related, family, emergency, ad hoc events), once a week through the negotiation module of the mobile app. Once a new medication schedule has been selected, this communicated to all stakeholders. The newly negotiated schedule then becomes active from that point forward as the new treatment adherence plan that will be monitored by stakeholders.After a new negotiated treatment plan has been selected by Mr. T., it is then used subsequently by the cloud-based coordination service to send messages to the smartwatch and the smartphone of Mr. T, and other stakeholders.The suite of cloud-based data analytics services that can be accessed from the dedicated mobile app for adherence monitoring is used by the HCW to generate a report on the adherence behaviour of a patient periodically, which could lead to a personalised and differentiated engagement with a TB patient to improve his adherence behaviour.All stakeholders can exchange messages or chat on issues that pertain to the TB patient to which they are affiliated via the mobile app, WhatsApp or email.\n",

To achieve this, the notion of multiple stakeholder collaboration that is driven by sensor-based adherence tracking and data analytics was introduced to support the patient in the treatment journey. Although MUCODAF is still at the conceptual stage, the imperatives for its implementation were also discussed, as well as the plausibility of its adoption for medication adherence monitoring and improvement in low resource settings.
