Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect COVID-19 following the recommended protocol (appendix p 1). Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed after two sequential positive respiratory tract sample results. Respiratory and faecal samples were collected every 1\u20132 days (depending on the availability of faecal samples) until two sequential negative results were obtained. We reviewed patients' demographic information, underlying diseases, clinical indices, and treatments from their official medical records. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (approval number K162-1) and informed consent was obtained from participants. Notably, patients who met discharge criteria were allowed to stay in hospital for extended observation and health care.",

These associations should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of confounding. Additionally, the Ct values of all three targeted genes (RdRp, N, E) in the first faecal sample that was positive for viral RNA were negatively associated with the duration of faecal viral RNA positivity (RdRp gene r= \u20130\u00b734; N gene r= \u20130\u00b702; and E gene r= \u20130\u00b716), whereas the correlation of the Ct values with duration of faecal sample positivity was only significant for RdRp (p=0\u00b7033; N gene p=0\u00b791; E gene p=0\u00b733).",

Strict precautions to prevent transmission should be taken for patients who are in hospital or self-quarantined if their faecal samples test positive.",

Our data suggest that faecal sample positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA normally lags behind that of respiratory tract samples; therefore, we do not suggest the addition of testing of faecal samples to the existing diagnostic procedures for COVID-19. However, the decision on when to discontinue precautions to prevent transmission in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 is crucial for management of medical resources. We would suggest the addition of faecal testing for SARS-CoV-2.3 Presently, the decision to discharge a patient is made if they show no relevant symptoms and at least two sequential negative results by real-time RT-PCR of sputum or respiratory tract samples collected more than 24 h apart. Here, we observed that for over half of patients, their faecal samples remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 11\u00b72 days after respiratory tract samples became negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, implying that the virus is actively replicating in the patient's gastrointestinal tract and that faecal\u2013oral transmission could occur after viral clearance in the respiratory tract.",

Additionally, we found patients normally had no or very mild symptoms after respiratory tract sample results became negative (data not shown); however, asymptomatic transmission has been reported.4 No cases of transmission via the faecal\u2013oral route have yet been reported for SARS-CoV-2, which might suggest that infection via this route is unlikely in quarantine facilities, in hospital, or while under self-isolation.
