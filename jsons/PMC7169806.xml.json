We now know that the \u03b2 inhibitor was, in fact, a protein called mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL), a component of the innate immune system (2). During the past 30 years, our understanding of this protein has steadily increased as a result of extensive research activity in three main areas: (a) bio/immunochemistry (including molecular genetics), (b) microbiology and (c) immunodeficiency. Work in these areas initially proceeded independently as evidence for both an inexplicable biological function and a clinical deficiency state emerged. The isolation and characterization of the protein were necessary in order to illuminate the observations of the so\u2010called RaRf bactericidal activity 3, 4 in the microbiology area and the opsonic deficiency reported in many paediatric populations. Some of the main developments are summarized in Table 1. This review briefly addresses issues relating to the early history of MBL, its structure, function, genetics and disease associations. Finally, future developments including the potential use of both plasma\u2010derived and recombinant MBL are discussed.",

The three CRDs in each structural subunit are separated by a constant 45\u2010\u00c5 distance (12). Clustering of the structural subunits provides a flat platform, permitting binding of MBL to the arrays of repeating sugar groups on microbial surfaces. Although the binding affinity of each individual CRD\u2013sugar interaction is relatively low at 10\u22123 M (13), the formation of higher order oligomers provides multiple CRDs, which are able to bind simultaneously with high avidity.",

The earliest work was probably by Kawakami et al. on the so\u2010called RaRf complex (which was later identified as MBL) and its interaction with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\n(3). This suggested that the structure and composition of lipopolysaccharide play a crucial role in MBL binding and function. Other mechanisms that enable microorganisms to avoid recognition and killing by MBL include lipooligosaccharide sialyation 16, 17. Despite much progress in this area, many puzzles remain to be addressed, mostly related to the exact disposition of sugars on microbial surfaces.",

In 1981, studies linked this opsonic deficiency to the complement system by demonstrating that sera with the deficiency deposited less C3b on yeast surfaces (31). However, it was not until 1989 that the common opsonic defect was found to be associated with low levels of the mannose\u2010binding protein, which we now refer to as MBL (32).

However, MBL\u20101 is a pseudogene and the potential mechanisms responsible for silencing the MBL\u20101 gene are under debate. In 1998, Guo et al. described an intron 1 splicing defect and two stop codons in exons 3 and 4 of the MBL\u20101 gene (62). More recently, Seyfarth et al. identified glycine substitutions in codon 53 of the MBL\u20101 gene, which bear a close resemblance to those found in codon 54 of the MBL\u20102 gene (63). Such substitutions were also found in other higher primates including chimpanzees and gorillas but not in more distant primates such as the rhesus monkey.

Similarities have been proposed between the MBL genetic system and the role of the sickle cell gene in protection against malaria as occurs in carriers of the sickle cell haemoglobin allele (64). The argument runs as follows: certain intracellular parasites use C3 opsonization and C3 receptors on monocytes/macrophages to enter their host. Therefore, any reduction in complement\u2010activating function of the host may reduce the probability of parasitization. In support of this notion is a study on patients with visceral leishmaniasis, which revealed that such patients are more likely to have high MBL levels than uninfected controls (65). A small study of Ethiopian patients with lepromatous or borderline lepromatous leprosy also found that their MBL levels were significantly higher than those of healthy blood donors (66). An alternative explanation of the unexpectedly high frequency of low MBL phenotype individuals found in many tropical regions is that excessive complement activation can result in immunopathologically mediated host damage; therefore, any mechanism that reduces complement activation may be beneficial (51).",

The B variant allele was found more commonly in patients with symptomatic hepatitis B cirrhosis and in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. It was also noted that MBL levels were lower in this patient cohort with chronic infection. Screening for MBL mutations in such patients was suggested in order to enable identification of those at increased risk of complications who may benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment. In 2005, Chong et al. also reported that MBL genotypes correlating with low protein levels were associated with the occurrence of cirrhosis and also hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B carriers (78). They also demonstrated that MBL is able to bind hepatitis B surface antigen. In the same year, Thio et al. published the results of a nested case\u2013control study of 527 patients who had either naturally recovered from hepatitis B (n= 338) or had persistent infection (n= 189). They found that MBL genotypes correlating with high serum levels were associated with recovery from infection, whereas those correlating with lower levels were associated with persistence of the virus (79).

One such group comprises those receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. These patients are rendered neutropenic by their treatment (or underlying disease process) and are subsequently at increased risk of infectious complications. In 2001, two studies were published reporting an effect of MBL deficiency in such patients. Neth et al. studied 100 children and measured MBL levels and genotype. Children in possession of MBL variant alleles spent twice as many days in hospital with febrile neutropenia during the first 6 months of their treatment compared with wild\u2010type individuals (81). In the other study, Peterslund et al. followed 54 adults undergoing chemotherapy for various haematological malignancies and found that those who developed \u2018significant\u2019 infections (bacteraemia, pneumonia or both) in the 3\u2010week periods post\u2010treatment had significantly lower levels of MBL compared with those without significant infections (82). Subsequent studies have shown differing results, but drawing comparisons between them is inherently difficult. These patients are a highly heterogeneous population, with different underlying disease processes, undergoing treatment regimens of differing intensity, resulting in various degrees of immunosuppression. In one contrasting study, Bergmann et al. followed 80 adults undergoing therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia, which involves intense highly myelosuppressive treatment. They found no effect of MBL deficiency on frequency, severity or duration of fever and suggested that the nature of the treatment overwhelmed any potential influence of MBL (83). Further clinical studies in such patients are required in order to delineate the exact role of MBL.",

Recent data indicate the MBL can opsonize HIV but does not induce neutralization at the levels at which it is normally present in serum. However, binding and opsonization of HIV by MBL may alter virus trafficking and viral antigen presentation during HIV infection. MBL may influence uptake by dendritic cells (DC), which express a cell surface lectin called \u2018DC\u2010specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3\u2010grabbing non\u2010integrin\u2019 (DC\u2010SIGN).

There is also an increased risk of vertical transmission from infected mothers to their offspring (91). However, these findings have not been replicated in all populations, with some studies failing to demonstrate a role for MBL in HIV infection 92, 93, 94. There is even less clarity with regard to the role of MBL in HIV disease progression. Garred et al. (87) demonstrated that men with MBL variant alleles had a shorter survival time following the onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than did patients with wild\u2010type MBL alleles. However, in a well\u2010characterized cohort of homosexual men, variant MBL alleles had an insignificant effect on survival following the diagnosis of AIDS (95). In this latter study, there appeared to be a protective effect of MBL variant alleles, with a delay in the development of AIDS from the time of HIV seroconversion. Patients with MBL variant alleles had lower CD4 counts at the time of developing AIDS, indicating that MBL deficiency may influence the onset of AIDS for any given CD4 count. Furthermore, MBL mutations appeared to protect against the development of Kaposi sarcoma, a finding that was difficult to explain (95). In another study, Prohaszka et al. (90) found that MBL levels were lower in asymptomatic HIV\u2010positive individuals compared with HIV\u2010negative controls. However, the protective effect of MBL was lost in patients with an AIDS diagnosis; patients with high MBL levels had significantly lower numbers of CD4 cells. A possible explanation is that enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production in advanced HIV disease acts to increase MBL synthesis (96), elevating levels in patients with late\u2010stage disease. Indeed, a recent study has shown in vitro that MBL can enhance proinflammatory cytokine production and viral replication (97). In the light of studies indicating a role for MBL in inflammatory modulation, it is tempting to suggest that under some circumstances, MBL may act to promote inflammatory cell activation, thereby accelerating the rate of CD4+ T\u2010cell depletion.",
