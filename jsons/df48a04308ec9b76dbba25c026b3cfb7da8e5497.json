Our study shows a reduction of 29.8% in PM 2,5 , similarly to findings reported by Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020). By contrast, we observed an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic. This result is consistent with the recent literature, for example, Sharma et al. (2020) reported an increase of 17% in O 3 concentration in India, and Tob\u00edas et al. 2020 observed an increase of 57.7% in ozone concentration in Barcelona, Spain. Ozone concentration increases have been associated with the decrease of NO, which may cause a decrease in ozone consumption, thus leading to a higher ozone concentration (Andrade et al. 2017; Tob\u00edas et al. 2020).",

For example, Zambrano-Monserrate et al.

Tob\u00edas et al. (2020) used the Copernicus Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, and also data from one traffic station in Barcelona (Spain), provided by the local organization for atmospheric pollution monitoring, to assess air quality changes during the lockdown in the city of Barcelona. The authors observed 31% and 51% reduction of particulate matter (PM 10 ) andnitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), respectively, during the lockdown compared to the month before the lockdown. Sharma et al. (2020) also analyzed local data from different regions in India, to of the lockdown on air quality. The authors observed 43% and 31% reduction of particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and particulate matter (PM 10 ), respectively, during the lockdown compared to the same time period of the past four years.",
