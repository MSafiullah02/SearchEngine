Nipah virus is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts including humans, pigs, ferrets, dogs, cats, hamsters, and at least 2 genera of bats. Little is known about the biology of NiV in the bat reservoir. In this study, we evaluate the potential for the Egyptian fruit bat (EFB), Rousettus aegyptiacus, to serve as a model organism for studying NiV in bats. Our data suggest that NiV does not efficiently replicate in EFBs in vivo. Furthermore, we show a lack of seroconversion against NiV glycoprotein and a lack of viral replication in primary and immortalized EFB-derived cell lines. Our data show that despite using a conserved target for viral entry, NiV replication is limited in some bat species. We conclude that EFBs are not an appropriate organism to model NiV infection or transmission in bats.",

Since its discovery in Malaysia in 1998, NiV has emerged as a persistent public health problem in southeast Asia warranting inclusion on the World Health Organization Blueprint list of priority diseases for which research toward effective countermeasures is urgently needed [1] . Unlike other paramyxoviruses, NiV has a broad host tropism with multiple taxa supporting viral replication including ferrets, hamsters, cats, dogs, African Green monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and pigs [2] [3] [4] [5] . Nipah virus uses 2 major envelope glycoproteins to enter the host cell: the receptorbinding protein (G) and the fusion protein (F) [6] . After attachment of the NiV G to the host cell receptor, ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, NiV F fusogenic activity is triggered leading to the merger of the virion and host cell membranes and subsequent virus infection [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Ephrins are highly conserved across mammalian taxa given their key role in development of the central nervous system [12] , likely contributing to the unusually broad host range of NiV.",

Pteropus spp bats are known to feed from the spigots of date palm sap collection jars, often urinating into and contaminating the collection jars before human consumption [14, 15] . Although Pteropus spp bats are implicated as the primary reservoir for NiV, they comprise only a fraction of the fruit bat visitation to date palm sap collection jars in Bangladesh [15] . Several other fruit bat species overlap with the distribution of Pteropus spp bats and visit date palm sap collection jars, suggesting that if other bats are potential secondary reservoirs for the virus, then they may contribute to Nipah virus spillover.",

            "text": "Our data show a lack of productive NiV replication in EFBs. The lack of detectable viral RNA in both the swabs and the tissues across all time points suggests that the bats did not shed virus nor was viral replication detected in any of the tested tissue types (Table 1) ; viral replication and shedding are qualities associated with natural hosts [36, 37] . Back-titrations of the viral inoculum confirmed that the EFBs received a 10 5 TCID 50 dose NiV, which is higher than the 5 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 NiV challenge that resulted in productive viral replication in guinea pigs and Pteropus bats [19] . A lack of detectable virus in any EFB tissue samples 3 days postinoculation suggests that the virus was rapidly cleared; Halpin et al [13] report that henipavirus inoculum is cleared within 48 hours. The bats did not seroconvert against NiV G in the given timeframe of 28 days, although 1 individual had a slight increase in mean fluorescence intensity at 21 and 28 DPI, which may have increased above our cutoff if given more time (Figure 4 ). Previous studies have demonstrated that EFB cells are permissive to Ebola virus, but experimentally challenged bats did not shed virus or support productive replication [38, 39] despite compatibility between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and the host receptor, NPC1 [40] . These data suggest that productive viral replication is blocked by a mechanism other than compatibility with the host receptor. Likewise, van Doremalen et al [41] reported a lack of efficient viral replication in EFBs when challenged with bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus WIV1 despite in vitro receptor compatibility. Given the lack of unique variation in either EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 relative to compatible host ephrin sequences (Figure 2) , it is likely that NiV virus replication is not inhibited by a lack of binding between NiV G and the EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, nor the subsequent F-mediated activation and membrane fusion process. Indeed, NiV F and G can mediate productive cell-cell fusion in a variety of different mammalian species including several that are negative or refractory to productive infection, such as rabbit and mouse [32, 42] . Because we did not detect viral replication or shedding, we conclude that EFBs are not a suitable model system for modeling NiV transmission dynamics in bats. However, follow-up studies to determine the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication in EFBs would be valuable in elucidating the evolution of NiV in its natural reservoirs. Few controlled studies have been conducted using bats as a model organism, and, as such, there are few reagents commercially available for studying the immunobiology of bats in response to viral infection. Further research is urgently needed to expand upon the current capacity to conduct research in bats, particularly when considering that 5 of 9 viruses associated with the World Health Organization's Blueprint list of priority diseases [1] likely originated as batborne zoonoses.",

Although it is important to consider broader ecological characteristics in determining potential for a host species to contribute to virus spillover and maintenance, understanding the limitations to reservoir potential on a mechanistic level for high-impact pathogens such as NiV would further improve predictive modeling work. Testing viral entry and replication through in vitro assays are important first steps in determining host potential, but this should be followed by in vivo experiments when possible. ",
