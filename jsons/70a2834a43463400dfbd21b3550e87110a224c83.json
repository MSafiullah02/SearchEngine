The traditional torus network has XY routing algorithm. We have proposed a novel optimised routing algorithm. This paper focuses on the time-dependent and time-independent analysis for both terminal and broadcast reliabilities of the torus network using XY and optimised routing algorithm under various network sizes ( N \u00d7 N where N = 8, 16, 32, 64 ).

            "text": "The reliability of the data centre (DC) primarily depends on the interconnection networks present within data centre networks (DCNs). The DCNs need to be agile, dynamic and scalable to handle increased traffic and application demands, to ensure high availability while providing various internet and cloud-based services across different domains. Recently, rapid growth of IoT industry, technical stack migrations to cloud can be considered as few of the major contributors to this increased demand. It is also very critical for industries to ensure a reliable DCN to handle unexpected traffic surges which could be due to various reasons such as natural disasters, pandemics (COVID-19), etc. Therefore, failures in the DCN components (for example, links, switches, and servers) can affect services provided by data centres and thus can threaten business continuity. Due to aforementioned factors, there is a need to analyse and address probability of server/node failures in DCN to ensure reliable communication and high availability. This study helps to analyse fault tolerance behaviour of DCN to avoid failures in DCN. Few examples of different types of DCN topologies are: direct network [19] , server centric [11, 13, 16, 17, 31] , tree-based topology [2] and hybrid network [15, 30] . Torus is a direct network topology in which every node serves as an input link, output link, and a switching node of the network [14] . The DCN architectures based on torus topology are highly scalable. The torus topology (as shown in Fig. 1 ) is a suitable candidate to avoid network congestion because of more number of equidistant links which reduces the delay throughout the network. The torus topology incorporates the property of high path diversity which provides high throughput under full load traffic. The DCN based on torus topology has already been implemented as high performance computing networks in [1, 3, 10, 12] . This topology optimises granularity of clusters and scalability of the topology because of its symmetric architecture [14] .",

Y\u2212 port is used to provide buffering and it is idle when both the output ports are free. In this algorithm, only one packet is processed in single time slot in a particular SE (switching element). According to the XYRA, high priority is set to X+ port to route the packet. If X+ port is busy, then Y+ port is used to route the packet. In this scenario, Y\u2212 port is also free, but it is idle and is used to provide inherent buffering [21] with the help of deflection routing scheme when both X+ and Y+ ports are busy. In this paper, for the sake of explaining, we have taken 4 \u00d7 4 network. For example, (0,1) is source node and (3, 2) is destination node as shown in Fig. 2 . From the source node, by default the packet is routed through X+ port (node (0,2)), if the X+ port is not free then, the packet is routed through Y+ port (node(1,1)). In both the scenarios, the packets reaches to the destination node in four hops. Whereas, if Y\u2212 is used to route the packet then the packet reaches to the destination in two hops using the wraparound path. This is achieved with optimised routing algorithm (ORA) using binary signalling as explained in the next section.",

In this algorithm, in a particular node, one packet is processed in a single time slot. In ORA, each node address represents n-digit radix-D (where 'D' represents nodes in one dimension) gray code address due to cyclic and unit distance properties of gray codes. Using these properties ORA is developed in which wraparound paths are utilised for routing when they are idle. In ORA, each node is connected to the neighbouring nodes with one bit difference in their node address. The first set of neighbouring nodes is denoted by H S (x, r) which is the hamming shell of radius r centred at node x, where r = 1 . The secondary and other neighbouring nodes are contributing to the formation of a Hamming ball of radius r is denoted by H B (x; r) , where r \u2265 2.",

The bit positions at which the node addresses differed gives the priority ports to route the packets. Out of the two selected nodes connected to the port with high priority, node with minimum hamming weight has given the first priority to route the packet. Therefore, in ORA three neighbouring nodes are available to route the packet without compromising the buffering capacity [21] , whereas in XYRA only two nodes are available to route the packet. In this paper, for the sake of analysis, we have taken 4 \u00d7 4 network. The same set of source-destination pair, (0001) as source and (1011) as destination node, is assumed with respect to XYRA, as shown in Fig. 3 . The packet is routed to the destination in minimum two hops (as shown in Fig. 3) . So, torus topology can be implemented as a data centre network using the ORA and yet analysis of reliability becomes a major concern for the evaluation of the entire network performance. The reliability of the data centre primarily depends on interconnection networks. In [28] , authors proposed augmented data vortex (ADV) based on all optical packet switching which has low latency, high capacity and high throughput. They have calculated terminal reliability for a single node pair as 0.986 assuming the ADV is symmetric. Further they have extended the node pair reliability for the entire network [29] . A similar study was performed in [23] where the authors proposed a novel high performance optical multistage interconnection network (OMINs) based on all optical packet switching. In this work, terminal reliability of the proposed bi-directional data vortex (BDV) network using fault tree analysis method based on component reliability was calculated. Here, the terminal reliability between a particular source-destination pair was calculated and extended to all the source-destination pairs because of the symmetric property of multistage interconnection network.",

The time-independent analysis gives an overview how the network reacts in the case of faulty nodes with various confidence intervals of node reliabilities, whereas the time-dependent analysis describes how the network responds when the nodes are failing with a constant rate without recovery. Reliability block diagram method (RBD) method [26] is used to evaluate the aforementioned aspects of reliability.",

The comparison and analysis of time-dependent reliability for Benes and torus network (using XYRA) is presented in [27] . So, we observed that torus network has high reliability than Benes network. Now, in this paper time-dependent and time-independent aspects of terminal and broadcast reliabilities of the torus network are analysed. The analysis is performed considering single source-destination pair (terminal reliability analysis)/pairs (broadcast reliability analysis) for the two-dimensional torus network of size N \u00d7 N (where N = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) using XY routing algorithm (XYRA) and optimised routing algorithm (ORA). The entire analysis is carried out considering symmetric torus topology as a direct network in which each node serves simultaneously as an input terminal, output terminal, and as a switching node of the network [14] . The terminal and broadcast reliabilities are evaluated considering node failures. The results are analysed, evaluated and compared in MATLAB. Since ORA has redundant paths, the reliability of ORA has been estimated in this paper. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes reliability block diagram method, Sects. 3 and 4 includes the terminal and broadcast reliability analysis using XYRA and ORA, respectively, and Sect. 5 presents the concluding remarks.",

The time-dependent terminal reliability of torus network using XYRA and ORA ( 64 \u00d7 64 ) is depicted in Fig. 11 . This analysis is carried out with the consideration of constant switch failure rate ( \u223c 10 \u22126 per hour).

This is observed because in XYRA only two links are available for routing, whereas in ORA it has three links available. However, it utilises the property of path diversity efficiently without compromising the inherent buffering capacity. Therefore, ORA provides better reliability than XYRA. Henceforth, during node failure, the probability to sustain a single path between a dedicated source-destination pair is high as compared to the XYRA.",

In this analysis, N 2 destination nodes are considered with single source node. According to ORA, three routing links are available from each node. However, there will be a decrease in the number of free non-overlapping paths with increase in network size. But, as compared to XYRA, ORA has more non-overlapping paths. Apart from this, node reliability also plays a crucial role while calculating both terminal and broadcast reliability. For high node reliability (0.99) chances of failures are less, thereby more paths are available, whereas for low node reliability (0.9) chances of failure being more, the number of available paths is reduced. Therefore, a decline is observed with low node reliability in Figs. 14 and 15. Whereas Figs. 9 and 10 represents the variation of terminal reliability analysis with respect to the network size of NxN (where N = 8, 16, 32, 64 ) using ORA and XYRA. And for this analysis, a specific source and destination is considered which will not affect the number of available non-overlapping paths. Hence, there is no significant decline observed in the timeindependent terminal reliability analysis. In this paper, to show the reliability analysis of XYRA and ORA we have chosen the network size of 64 \u00d7 64 . This analysis can be extended to N \u00d7 N network using Eqs. (14) , (16) , (18) and (20) . The analysis shows that the time-independent broadcast reliability of torus network of size 64 \u00d7 64 with various switch reliabilities using ORA is higher than XY algorithm as shown in Table 2 . The time-dependent broadcast reliability of torus network using XYRA and ORA for the network size of 64 \u00d7 64 as shown in Fig. 16 . This analysis is done with the consideration of constant switch failure rate ( \u223c 10 \u22126 per hour). As depicted from Fig. 16 , the time-dependent broadcast reliability of torus network ( 64 \u00d7 64 ) using ORA is 0.535884 and using XYRA is 0.192896 over a duration of 1, 00, 000 hours. This is observed because while broadcasting from the source node in ORA, every packet can use three output links at each node as compared to two output links in the case of XYRA. Therefore, the broadcast reliability of ORA is better than XYRA. ",

The reliability for the network of size N \u00d7 N (where N =4, 8, 16, 32, 64) using XY routing algorithm and optimised routing algorithm was analysed. In this study, time-dependent & time-independent analysis of terminal and broadcast reliability using an accurate analytical method was performed. For the time-independent analysis, confidence levels of 0.99 (high switch reliability), 0.95 (medium switch reliability) and 0.9 (low switch reliability) were considered. The time-dependent analysis was performed with a constant switch failure rate of 10 \u22126 per hour. The overall network reliability was evaluated considering node failures. The results were evaluated in MATLAB. The analysis explains that the reliability of the torus network employing ORA was better than XY algorithm. This was observed because in ORA the property of path diversity was efficiently utilised without compromising the inherent buffering capacity. While comparing reliability of ORA for torus network of size 64 \u00d7 64 against XYRA, an improvement of 64% is observed in time-independent broadcast reliability and an improvement of 6% is observed in time-independent terminal reliability considering node reliability of 0.9, whereas an improvement of 70.5% is observed in time-dependent broadcast reliability and improvement of 6.05% is observed in timedependent terminal reliability considering duration of 1,00,000 h.",
