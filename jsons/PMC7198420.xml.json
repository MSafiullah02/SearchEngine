For instance, why did our patient\u2019s first ECG upon admission with no fever show type I Brugada pattern while the last ECG after defervescence, back to his initial temperature on admission, show narrower QRS complex on the right precordial leads with near-resolution of the coved ST-elevation in lead V2? COVID-19 may directly impact the myocardium manifesting with changes on the ECG and echocardiogram suggestive of myocardial ischemia and/or inflammation.4 As the Brugada group noted, what if the virus has a higher propensity to directly affect the myocardial sodium channels compared to other previously encountered respiratory virus infections that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)?4 What about potential pre-existing myocardial scarring contributing to our patient\u2019s presentation in the setting of the infection?",
