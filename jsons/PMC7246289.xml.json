            "text": "The Delhi air flux is the most pernicious consequences of indiscriminate industrialisation and urbanisation. The WHO (2020) report stunned with the 4.2 million premature death tolls annually due to air pollution and it has estimated that nearly 90% urban inhabitants live in air pollution that exceeds WHO guidelines. It has been observed that the people living in the areas of beyond safer levels of air to breath are more vulnerable to Novel Coronavirus Disease COVID-19. It was reported that the higher levels of air pollution compromise individual\u2019s lung function that results into more vulnerability to virus infections (Wang et al. 2020; Kanawade et al. 2019; Nahid et al. 2019). In early December 2019, the capital Hubei province in central China, city Wuhan diagnosed a patient with an unusual pneumonia of unknown cause (Cadotte et al. 2019). By 31 December 2019 in Beijing, the WHO notified with an array of pneumonia patients from Wuhan itself. Researchers at \u201cWuhan Institute of Virology\u201d after a rigorous study identified a potential aetiology \u201cNovel Corona Virus-19 with an incubation period expected within 6.4 days (Backer et al. 2020). In the triad of the infectious diseases, the role of environment is ambiguous. However, it is well known that air receives aetiological agents onto aerosols/particulate matter as host in prevailing polluted environment which are inhaled into our lungs through respiratory tract; hence, we are more susceptible to viral attacks. Therefore, a cleaner environment would prove to be a measure to halt and reduce the transmission of viral infections, such as COVID-19, SARS and MERS (Tesini 2020).",

            "text": "It is well known that air pollutants present in the atmosphere in different concentrations disturb the dynamic equilibrium in the atmosphere and thereby affect our health and environment (De Anil 2019). In general, five primary pollutants are opted to determine the air quality namely carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HCs), sulphur oxides (SO2) and particulate matter (PM). However, the evaluation of the pollutants and the sources in terms of tonnage does not give the correct picture since even a minor pollutant can be much more dangerous than a major pollutant for our health. Thus, particulate pollutants are the most dangerous among the primary pollutants. PM falls in the category of carcinogen (Raaschou and Andersen 2013) and elevates the risk of heart attacks (Cesaroni et al. 2014). The prolonged exposure to NO2 and SO2 can damage lung tissues which could be a big factor in the emergence of asthma and lung cancer (Greenberg et al. 2016; Khaniabadi et al. 2017). A study on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus outbreak in China in the year 2003 found that infected people from highly polluted areas were twice as likely to die from the virus as those from the cleaner environment. Studies also found that as the pollution levels spiked from 4% in less polluted region to 7.5% in-moderately polluted region up to 9% in highly polluted locations, the SARS death rate increased sharply (Tesini 2020). Moreover, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) corona virus outbreak in Saudi Arabia from the year 2012 indicated that tobacco smokers were more vulnerable to die from the virus. Hence, indications from the previous virus outbreaks coupled with the statistical analysis imply at a link between air pollution and COVID-19 that cannot be ignored.",

            "text": "Lockdown is an emergency protocol from the Government to shut down most of the offices, industries, private companies and not to allow people to move from a given area. Due to coronavirus pandemic prevailing in more than 200 countries and some of them have promulgated lockdown (Bukhari and Jameel 2020). On March 24, 2020 India also imposed lockdown for 21 days to prevent the community spread of virus among people. Since then, lockdown allows only movement of essential supplies, grocery items, pharmacies and banks to continue to serve the people. However, heavily restricted travel restrictions have been imposed on transport movements of flights, rail and intercity bus services have been suspended throughout the country (India Weather Report 2020, https://www.weather.com/en-IN/india/pollution/news/2020-03-18-covid-19-pollution-smoking-vulnerable-novel-coronavirus-disease). Within two days of lockdown, a significant improvement in the air quality was observed, which prompted us to analyse the air quality level as one of the best model on Delhi environment. For last few months beginning from November 2019, Delhi air quality has been recorded in unhealthy zone, most of the time, except during the lockdown period when it explicitly confirms the better air quality. India has been struggling hard for few years to mitigate environment pollution by funding high value projects, but no significant solution could be achieved in this direction. A Boon for masses to breathe healthy air has been realised only after imposing lockdown to circumvent the community spread of corona virus. Due to this, the air quality improved to healthy from worse quality and it can be directly correlated to the functioning of bare minimum industries, vehicular and air traffic movement which resulted into a very low emissions of pollutants in the air. Restricted transport, human activities, commercial and industrial activities during COVID-19 pandemic has revealed direct impact on air quality of Delhi region (CPCB 2020). The COVID-19 outbreak emergency measures to circumvent the transmission rate of virus from one person to other person but in turn, it also resulted in unprecedented dramatic drop in pollutants emissions. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over more than one million people in more than 200 counties, territories and two international conveyances across the world, a scourge confronting all of humanity, impacting economies, lifestyles, trade and commerce by inducing turbulence on global economy and attenuating the trade flow growth. The situation has now been aggravated by the demand, supply and liquidity shocks that COVID-19 has inflicted. Once the pandemic is controlled, the shape and speed of the recovery in the USA and China would be the key factors in determining the traction and nature of global economic recovery (Report No. 1, 2020).",

Spiked PM2.5 concentrations at North campus (mixed area an IMD site) could be due to the overcrowded Delhi University campus with heavy traffic during peak days of the classes and time. Since Delhi is under the lockdown period, all colleges and workplaces are shutdown; hence, one may visualise a drastic decrease in PM2.5 concentration in Fig. 5.",

The CO declining trend may be due to North campus activity being a university area with narrow roads having multiple turns at shorter distances and more traffic light stoppages. Therefore, it results into vehicle\u2019s average speed limits to 10\u201320 km/h and idling time of engines is also high that results into incomplete combustion from vehicular exhausts. Such situation leads to significant elevated levels of CO concentration. Thus, CO concentration in this region during COVID-19 lockdown is reduced.",

The colosal decrease in all four parameters confirms a boon for COVID-19 infected persons and masses in general due to lockdown clamping in India has helped to improve air quality drastically. Most importantly, the significant decrease in the air pollution markers namely PM10, PM2.5, NH3, SO2, NO, NO2, NOx and CO are emerging evidences to air pollution being an important environmental factors that may be contributing in disease pathogenesis (Jeong et al. 2019). During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the concentration surface O3 is also reduced over Delhi region may be due to narrowing down of its precursor gases, i.e. NO, NO2, CO and non-methane hydrocarbon, etc. (data not reported).",

Although the COVID-19 pandemic poses a potential risk for health and wellbeing of populations globally, especially those living in high-density urban areas; the impacts of air pollution are equally consequential. On March 24, 2020 India implemented lockdown in the country for 21 days to prevent the community spread of virus among people. The experimental data pattern has depicted explicitly the significant reduction in the PM and trace gases (PM10, PM2.5, NH3, SO2, NO, NO2, NOx and CO) concentrations across the megacity Delhi. Ultimately, the air quality analysis in the present study suggests that lockdown has helped us in circumventing the corona virus community spread besides a boon for air quality improvement in unimaginable limits that compels environmentalists to resolve and re-direct the environmental pollution issues in new dimensions. Therefore, a cleaner environment would prove to be an effective measure to halt and reduce the transmission of viral infections. Although mandating changes to economic or transportation activity or investing in clean technology would better protect human health from the effects of air pollution and thereby leading to a reduced community transmission of viral infections too.
