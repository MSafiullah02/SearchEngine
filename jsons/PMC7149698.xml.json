The parietal peritoneum covers the abdominal wall and diaphragm. The visceral peritoneum covers the abdominal organs (Fig. 26-1\n). The peritoneum consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells covering a basement membrane.1 The peritoneal mesothelial cells have the same embryological origin as vascular endothelial cells2 and produce surfactant that acts as a lubricant.3 The basement membrane is a fibroelastic tissue containing glycosylated proteins, mast cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes and it covers a well-defined network of elastic fibers. The basement membrane is absent in parts of the diaphragm, omentum, and mesentery.1 The absence of the basement membrane in the diaphragm allows large gaps between the mesothelial cells (\u2018stomata\u2019) to communicate directly with underlying lymphatic channels, facilitating absorption of fluid and particulate matter.",

Polymicrobial infections present a significant problem because of bacterial synergism. This appears to be most important in mixed infections with Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone (such as Bacillus fragilis) seem to cause minimal pathology in experimental models. However, when combined with Gram negative enteric bacteria, the resulting infection is considerably more severe.25 Ingesta, exfoliated cells, blood, gastric mucin, and bile salts are adjuvant substances that worsen peritonitis. Blood is an excellent growth medium for bacteria and hemoglobin interferes with chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Bile salts destroy peritoneal mesothelial cells and inhibit neutrophil function.",

Bile peritonitis is diagnosed based on cytological and biochemical analysis of peritoneal fluid. The diagnosis of uroperitoneum is based on a history of either blunt abdominal trauma, recent catheterization, or recent expression of the bladder. In the majority of cats with uroperitoneum, the peritoneal fluid creatinine and potassium levels are higher than those in the serum (see Chapter 3).35\n",

Primary peritonitis is more commonly reported in human than veterinary patients and is usually associated with diseases that cause ascites, such as cirrhosis.30, 31, 40, 41 In veterinary medicine, FIP is the most common cause of primary peritonitis.39, 42 FIP is caused by infection with a feline coronavirus and presents in two forms, the granulomatous (dry) form or the effusive (wet) form, which is the form that results in abdominal effusion and peritonitis.43 In a retrospective study on cats with peritonitis, four out of 65 cats had primary peritonitis resulting from the effusive FIP.44 There are numerous reports of primary peritonitis in cats due to other pathogens besides FIP; however, the true source of the infection in most cases is unclear.45, 46, 47, 48, 49\n",

Synthetic colloids (Hetastarch, Dextran 70) are administered as a bolus (5 mL/kg) with 20\u201330 mL/kg of crystalloid. When available, fresh frozen plasma provides albumin and clotting factors.

Although some clinicians use 0.9% NaCl to avoid administering potassium, it is clear that more balanced electrolyte solutions (lactated Ringer's, Normasol R) allow for a more rapid correction of acid\u2013base status without affecting normalization of serum potassium levels.69, 70 In cases of marked hyperkalemia, calcium gluconate (a functional antagonist of potassium) should be administered slowly, intravenously (0.5 mL/kg). Although it does not lower serum potassium, calcium changes the threshold potential and returns membrane excitability to normal for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Regular insulin (1 unit/kg) and/or glucose (1\u20132 g/unit of insulin) can also be administered. Animals are often also severely acidotic. Sodium bicarbonate can be administered (3\u20139 mEq/kg) to correct acidosis; however, this can paradoxically lower ionized calcium and so worsen the effects of hyperkalemia. Correction of the hyperkalemia and acidosis depends on re-establishing urine flow to allow effective potassium and acid excretion from the body. In animals with uroperitoneum this involves placement of a catheter to drain urine from the peritoneal cavity and ideally placement of a catheter into the bladder via the urethra. In cases where the urethra is completely transected a cystostomy tube is placed surgically or by using interventional radiology techniques.",

The omentum provides a rich blood supply, has absorptive capabilities, and stimulates angiogenesis.1 The omentum will also form adhesions to help seal off or isolate sources of contamination. Omentalization can be used when the source of the infection cannot be entirely removed, such as prostatic or pancreatic abscesses. The abscess cavity is located by palpation, intraoperative ultrasound, or aspiration. It is opened, drained, and the abscess cavity is gently debrided with a moistened gauze sponge. After thorough local lavage with a warm, balanced electrolyte solution, the omentum is packed loosely into the cavity and the abdominal incision is closed. The immunologic and angiogenic properties of the omentum promote local infection control and healing. The technique has been associated with some success in (six of 12; 50% survival) dogs with pancreatic abscesses.73 Results of a large clinical study of omentalization for abdominal abscesses in cats are lacking.",

Whilst the concept of treating the peritoneal cavity in a similar manner to any other contaminated wound seems reasonable, peritoneal lavage has both beneficial and detrimental effects.75 Peritoneal lavage does not necessarily decrease peritoneal bacterial contamination. Once bacteria have colonized and adhered to the peritoneum, they are difficult to remove by lavage.76, 77 Lavage fluid remaining in the peritoneal cavity dilutes complement and other opsonins and suspends bacteria away from neutrophils and macrophages, making phagocytosis more difficult. Lavage, then, should ideally be used to remove blood, purulent material, bile, mucus, and gross intestinal content from the peritoneal cavity but all fluid should be aspirated before the abdominal cavity is closed. The best fluid to use for peritoneal lavage has not been determined. The addition of antiseptics to lavage fluid is not recommended in clinical cases because of toxicity (povidone iodine) or a lack of perceived clinical efficacy in spite of benefits in some experimental models (chlorhexidine). The addition of antibiotics to lavage fluid has no benefit over parenteral antibiotics administered intravenously at the appropriate doses.",

            "text": "The use of closed-suction drains in generalized peritonitis has been reported in cats and dogs. Some type of suction or vacuum system is necessary for drains to be potentially effective because the peritoneal space within the abdomen is at a sub-atmospheric pressure. Even with experimental insufflation of air, the intraperitoneal pressure never exceeds atmospheric pressure.79 Unless either the intraperitoneal pressure becomes higher than atmospheric or air can enter the peritoneal cavity postoperatively through a vent, drainage from the peritoneal cavity will not occur without the use of a vacuum system. The use of drains within the peritoneal cavity is somewhat controversial because of the discrepancy between reasonable clinical results from their use and experimental studies clearly showing that the omentum and viscera rapidly encase drains inserted into the peritoneal cavity.80 It is therefore not clear if drainage occurs from the peritoneal cavity proper or, more likely, from the area around the encased drain. In an experimental study in dogs, sump-Penrose drains were found encapsulated and isolated from the peritoneal cavity at necropsy performed after 48 hours.5 Despite this isolation, the drains continued to remove radio-opaque contrast material from the peritoneal cavity. In a clinical study of closed-suction silicone drains for septic peritonitis, drains continued to accumulate fluid for up to eight days, seeming to indicate adequate function. However, it is not clear if closed-suction drains are encased to the same extent as sump-Penrose drains and are draining a localized area, or if they retain functional drainage of the peritoneal cavity despite being encased.81 This study reported 70% survival in a cohort of 30 dogs and ten cats with septic peritonitis managed with closed-suction drains. Drains were in place for a mean of 3.6 days with a range of two to eight days. The volume of fluid produced was variable but decreased with time. The drains remained patent until removal, as evidenced by ongoing fluid collection. However, it is unclear what percentage of the total peritoneal fluid volume they drained. No significant complications were reported with clinical use of the closed-suction drains.",

The falciform fat should be excised according to standard exploratory laparotomy technique (see Chapter 23), but omentectomy is not necessary or desirable. The linea alba is closed with non-absorbable suture in a simple continuous pattern with a gap of 1\u20133 cm between the edges (Fig. 26-6), depending on the patient's size. The subcutaneous tissues and skin are not closed. A sterile bandage consisting of a non-adherent contact layer, such as petrolatum impregnated gauze, laparotomy sponges, and surgery towels underneath routine bandage material is applied and changed at least daily. If the bandage becomes wet from peritoneal effusion or urine, or if the bandage becomes displaced, the bandage should be replaced as soon as possible. The bandage should be changed in the operating room with the patient sedated or anesthetized. During each bandage change, adhesions at the incision are digitally disrupted and the incision is checked for organ evisceration. The decision to close the peritoneal cavity is based on reassessment of the same factors used in selecting open peritoneal drainage or cytological analysis of the effusion. Closure is performed as a complete laparotomy.\n",
