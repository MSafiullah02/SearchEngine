            "text": "Zika virus has caused global concern due to the accumulating evidence suggesting that infection is associated with microcephaly and neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [1\u20134]. However, there are currently no approved antivirals against Zika infection [5]. Administration of polyclonal or purified neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to pregnant mice helps to clear the virus and alleviates the neurological disorders in their fetuses [6, 7], providing proof of concept that neutralizing mAbs can be used to treat Zika virus infections. Currently, multiple strategies have been reported to generate human neutralizing mAbs against Zika infection, including sequencing antigen-specific memory B cells [8, 9] or generating Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized memory B cells from Zika patient samples [10], and identifying functional mAbs from phage display na\u00efve antibody libraries [11]. In addition, murine mAbs against Zika virus have also been reported [12].",

Subsequently, the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes encoded by the sorted cells were determined at the single-cell level. The approach to determine the Ig genes from single cells was first reported by Tiller et al. [13]. Later, Scheid et al. modified this approach to sequence single gp140-binding memory B cells, which were isolated from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients [14]. Then the mAbs against human papillomavirus (HPV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were isolated from immunized or naturally infected human donors, respectively [15, 16]. During the epidemic of Zika virus, we and other groups also applied this strategy to isolate mAbs targeting Zika virus from Zika patients [8, 9].",

A separate space is also recommended for performing all experiments using EtBr-containing materials.Do not pull the comb out too soon, as it causes the wells to collapse. It will take 15\u201320 min to gel. If the gel cannot be used in 1 h, it is recommended to transfer the gel without comb into a tank containing 1\u00d7 TAE buffer.The primers used for the amplification of Ig genes are the same as reported (see Tables 2\u20138) [18]. However, after sequencing, cloning of the expression vectors was designed based on the pCAGGS vector.All primers are stored in small aliquots to avoid repeated freezing and thawing.The blood sample of the convalescent Zika patient was collected 20 days post onset of fever, headache, and dizziness. It is reported that after immunization, antigen-specific B cells with a memory phenotype could be detected in the blood within 1 week [19]. In the presence of antigens, memory B cells undergo affinity maturation, and their B-cell receptors have increased affinities for the antigen. Studies on memory B cells after smallpox vaccination in humans indicated that antigen-specific memory B cells initially declined postimmunization (1 year) but then reached a plateau ~tenfold lower than peak and were stably maintained for >50 years after vaccination [20]. Thus, considering the time that needed for affinity maturation, we recommend collecting the blood 1 month\u20131 year post onset of symptoms to isolate specific mAbs.When layering the sample, do not mix the density gradient medium solution and the diluted blood sample. Keep them in separate layers.The break should be turned off at this step. For other steps using centrifuging, set the break on.If the blood has been collected for >2 h, extend the centrifuging time to 30 min.Usually, 3\u20134 mL of solutions containing PBMCs will be pipetted out from 10 mL of the blood.For example, if the cell density is determined to be 1 \u00d7 106/mL at step 13 in Subheading 3.1, the total cell number is 1\u00d7 106/mL \u00d7 15 mL = 1.5 \u00d7 107. Thus, we need to add 1.5 mL freezing medium to resuspend the cells.Freshly prepared PBMCs exert higher efficiencies for Ig gene amplification than frozen cells. Thus, freshly prepared PBMCs are recommended for the isolation of mAbs. In case the following cell sorting cannot be performed immediately, the methods using the freezing cells are provided in Subheading 3.2. Memory B cells express CD19 and CD27, but not CD38. In this study, we focus on the IgG+ memory B cells.If fresh PBMCs are used here, please skip to step 8. If using frozen cells, please follow step 2.Before turning the tube right side up, it is recommended to aspirate the liquid left around the tube orifice.It is difficult to decant the entire buffer. Usually, ~50 \u03bcL of buffer will be left. Thus, we add 50 \u03bcL FACS buffer for 107 cells or 150 \u03bcL for 2 \u00d7 107 cells.There are three antibodies conjugated with PE-Cy\u00ae5. They are anti-human CD3/PE-Cy\u00ae5, anti-human CD16/PE-Cy\u00ae5, and anti-human CD235a/PE-Cy\u00ae5. Any of the three are suitable for preparation of the compensation beads for PE-Cy\u00ae5.The steps in this section are specific to, but not limited to, a BD FACSAria III cytometer.Here, we use the markers for T cells, NK cells, and platelets for negative selection, to exclude their disturbance.Here, we include FSC-A and FSC-H to exclude cell aggregates.We are not sure about the proportion of memory B cells that bind to Zika E protein. Thus, it is difficult to set the threshold to distinguish antigen-specific memory B cells from those targeting other antigens in the sample of Zika patient PBMCs. In previous work, we studied the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its receptor CD26, which is widely expressed on lymphocytes, including T cells. Here, we used the MERS-RBD, which is also tagged at its C-terminus with 6\u00d7 His like the Zika E protein, to stain PBMCs from a healthy donor. Then, anti-His/PE was applied to bind to the His tag. Through comparison between the results in Fig. 2B and C, we could determine the threshold to gate the Zika E-specific memory B cells, as indicated in Fig. 2D.The PCR reactions are performed in 96-well plates.The combined primers are used to amplify Ig genes in the PCRb. However, different primers in a single tube might disturb each other and reduce their annealing efficiency. Thus, in terms of the single cells that yield typical bands for the kappa or lambda chain but not for heavy chain in gel electroporation, we usually repeat PCRb using the separate primers. In addition, MgCl2 exerts effects on the activities of DNA polymerase (for sing-cell PCR). Varied concentrations of MgCl2, ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 mM, can also be applied to amplify the variable region of the heavy chain from single cell, whose light chains\u2019 variable regions have been sequenced.From PMBCs isolated from 10 mL whole blood of a convalescent patient, we finally sequenced 15 paired mAbs, which have been published previously [8].Here, we introduce the traditional method to double digest the PCR segments with two restriction enzymes and clone them into the same sites in the linearized pCAGGS vector using T4 ligase. However, other methods (e.g., In-Fusion reaction [21]) can be used.Here we displayed the results for Z6, Z20, and Z23.The steps in this section are specific to, but not limited to, a Biacore T100 system.In addition to SPR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is another typical method to assess the interaction between mAbs and antigens. However, for Zika E-specific mAbs, we found that some of them displayed relatively low response to the antigens coated on the plate (data not shown here). It is possible that Zika E proteins undergo some conformational changes when adsorbing to the plate, which results in the decreased binding to certain mAbs. In terms of SPR experiments, the mAbs were captured on the chip through interactions with protein A, which binds to the Fc region. Thus, the CDRs of mAbs orient to the buffer flowing over the chip surface. In addition, the Zika E proteins in the buffer of HBS-EP are label-free and more prone to be in its native conformation than those coated on the plate. Thus, we chose SPR assay to detect the interaction between mAbs and antigens.For example, if the original supernatant reaches to 1000 RU with 30 \u03bcL, then shorten the injecting time from 60 to 30 s, or dilute the supernatant with equal volume of 1\u00d7 HBS-EP buffer and load 60 s. If 30 \u03bcL of the original supernatant enables 200 RU, then extend the injecting time to 150 s.Due to the different binding kinetics between an antigen and its mAb, we set varied dissociation time. For example, mAb Z6 dissociates with Zika E with very low rate; thus we set 600 s for their dissociation. However, for both Z20 and Z23, they are ready to dissociate with the antigen, and 60 s was used for their dissociation (Fig. S2 G, J, and L in the paper [8]).Due to the different binding kinetics between mAbs and Zika E protein, the data could be fit by either a steady state affinity model or 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model.\n",

Then, the goat anti-hIgG antibody conjugated with HRP (1:1000) was used to incubate the membrane transferred with the mAbs. Here, we displayed the results for Z6, Z20, and Z23. The upper arrow indicates the heavy chain, and the lower arrow indicates the light chain. 293T represents the parallel culture supernatant of HEK 293T cells without transfections",
