Colonization is further influenced by mode of delivery and postpartum environmental exposures and medical procedures, infant genetic factors, medications and supplements, enteral feeding, and maturity of the infant innate and adaptive immune systems. Breakthroughs in recent decades in the analysis of complex communities of bacteria and viruses and studies in germ-free and gnotobiotic animals have vastly expanded our understanding of the importance of interactions between host and microbe. The composition of the microbial community of the intestinal tract and skin impacts inflammatory pathways and is thus important in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of disease processes (Box 1\n). Novel mechanisms by which the microbiota influences host immunity and inflammation have recently been described.1, 2, 3\nBox 1Diseases and conditions in which the microbiota plays a role in pathogenesis\n\n",

The roles of the skin microbiota in sepsis risk and the oral microbiota in pneumonia risk are less clear. Perhaps most compelling is the role of colonizing microbes in shaping and influencing the developing innate and adaptive immune responses in extremely preterm infants and the long-term impact of these host-microbe interactions. An additional layer of complexity is emerging with the realization that nutrients (eg, human milk, infant formulas and fortifiers, vitamins and minerals) are consumed by both host and bacterial cells, often with keen competition and overlapping effects. Host-microbe-nutrient interactions are likely to be particularly important in such processes as growth, brain development, immune development, and disease risk for the most preterm infants. In this article, we use the terms microbiota to refer to the composition of bacteria in a given anatomic niche and dysbiosis to mean an alteration in the microbiota associated with disease. There is evidence of significant colonization of the extremely preterm infant with yeasts, bacteriophages, and other viruses,4 but discussion of these microbes is beyond the scope of this article.",

Table 1\nsummarizes the primary bacterial taxa that colonize the preterm infant. It has long been believed that the fetus grows in a sterile environment and that colonization begins at the time of rupture of the fetal membranes. More recent careful studies have shown that the amniotic fluid is not sterile, suggesting that colonization of the fetal skin and gut begins in utero.5 The role of microbes in triggering preterm labor is perhaps the most clinically relevant observation related to this observation. Chorioamnionitis has long been recognized as a trigger of preterm labor and neonatal infection (particularly in preterm infants). The preponderance of evidence suggests a causal relationship between maternal periodontal disease and preterm labor.6 For instance, the presence of specific bacteria (eg, Peptostreptococcus micros or Campylobacter rectus) in maternal gingival plaque was associated with increased risk of preterm delivery.7 Treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy is associated with decreased risk of preterm labor.8 The demonstration of the same microbes in the amniotic fluid and periodontal plaques in women delivering preterm,9 the observation that the most common bacterium identified in amniotic fluid from women delivering preterm is Fusobacterium nucleatum (a common oral microbe in adults),10 and the observation that dental infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (a common bacterium in periodontal disease) causes preterm birth, low birth weight, and colonization of the placenta in mice11 suggests actual colonization of the placenta and fetus.",

These observations suggest that environmental factors and maturation of the host immune response are the primary shapers of the developing gut microbiota in preterm infants. It is worth noting how strikingly the fecal microbiota of the preterm infant differs from that of the healthy term infant with the former often containing 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher levels of \u03b3-Proteobacteria and the latter commonly dominated by bifidobacteria and Bacteroides.",

These results differ dramatically from studies of the fecal microbiota and raise the possibility that, although rare in the feces of preterm infants, the 2 genera of bacteria capable of consuming HMOs may be present in their small bowel.23 In this study, Helicobacter pylori and Ureaplasma were not identified; however, a different study of 12 neonates with an average gestational age of 27 weeks (\u00b10.5) found the predominant species in the first week of life to be Ureaplasma, with a predominance of S epidermidis in subsequent weeks. By the fourth week, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes each accounted for 50% of the total gastric organisms.24 The reasons for this disparity are unclear, but may represent differences in technique (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in the first study and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-amplified clones in the second), differences in population (both studies were performed in the United States, but diversity in maternal colonization with Ureaplasma may have played a role), or the relatively small numbers of infants analyzed.",

At birth the oral swabs did not show significant growth of culturable bacteria, but by week one, 21 infants were colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 6 infants had other pathogenic bacteria (S aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli), 56 infants were colonized with \u201cnonpathogenic bacteria\u201d (S epidermidis was most common followed by Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus), and 22 infants still showed no significant growth of culturable bacteria.

The stratum corneum, which functions as the epidermal barrier, is nearly absent at 23 weeks\u2019 gestation, has a few cornified layers at 26 weeks, and is not fully mature until approximately 34 weeks\u2019 gestation.28 When infants are born preterm, the epidermis matures fairly rapidly, and even the most immature neonate has functionally and histologically mature epidermis by approximately 2 weeks postnatal age.29 Studies of the skin microbiota of the extremely preterm infant are limited. Several studies have demonstrated that pathogens commonly colonize the skin of preterm infants (mostly staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadales, and Candida) and that MRSA colonization is more common in the preterm infant; however, these studies were not designed to analyze the broader skin microbiota.30, 31, 32 The previously noted study comparing changes over time in the saliva, skin, and feces included 1 infant with gestational age 24 weeks. The skin of this infant was dominated by staphylococci during the time of testing (day 8 to day 21) and did not differ from the older preterm infants.16 Environmental factors that influence the skin microbiota include parental skin, feeding type, environmental surfaces and caregiving equipment, health care provider skin, and antibiotic use.33\n",

            "text": "The incidences of NEC and sepsis are highest in the most preterm infants, likely due to immaturity of intestinal and skin barriers and immaturity of immune responses. Cases and outbreaks of NEC have been associated with a striking variety of organisms (Table 2\n), suggesting that there is not a single organism responsible. The evidence that the early or colonizing microbiota of the intestine influences the risk for subsequent development of NEC and/or sepsis has become quite compelling. The observation that NEC is most common in infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation and most commonly occurs at 30 to 32 weeks corrected gestational age34 suggests that maturation of the host immune response and/or maturation of the intestinal microbiota are important in NEC pathogenesis. The Paneth cells of the small intestine produce large quantities of antimicrobial peptides that shape the intestinal microbiota.35 It is not likely coincidental that Paneth cells increase in numbers and become immune-competent at 29 weeks corrected gestational age.36, 37 Lower fecal bacterial diversity and/or richness is common in extremely preterm infants and has been demonstrated in some studies of infants with NEC compared with matched controls,22, 38, 39, 40 although this is not universal.41, 42 Studies investigating the fecal microbiota before the onset of NEC compared with matched controls are summarized in Table 3\n.40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 These studies demonstrate the following: (1) colonization patterns differ between preterm infants who subsequently develop NEC and those who do not; (2) these differences are heavily influenced by maturation, NICU location, antibiotic exposure, and perhaps feeding type; (3) it remains unclear whether NEC risk is associated with the absence of potentially protective microbes (eg, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Veillonella species) or the dominance of potentially pathogenic microbes (eg, Enterobacteriaceae or Clostridium species); and (4) it remains unclear whether dysbiosis is the cause of NEC or a marker of alterations in host genetics or immune development. Two observations support the hypothesis that Enterobacteriaceae are important in the pathogenesis of NEC: (1) recognition of lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall of Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae by Toll-like receptor 4 triggers a proinflammatory response and an influx of lymphocytes that in animal models is essential to the development of NEC,55 and (2) Enterobacteriaceae have unique metabolic pathways by which they both trigger inflammation and use the products of the host inflammatory response as an energy source allowing them to outcompete other gut microbes.56\n",

Whether these recommendations are justifiable given the incidence, cost, and severity of NEC and the relative paucity of evidence of harm associated with probiotic administration is hotly debated. In addition, it has been widely reported that although probiotic products appear to be beneficial for preterm infants with birth weight greater than 1000 g, data supporting a benefit for extremely low birth weight infants are lacking.21\nTables 5 and 6\nsummarize the data available from the randomized controlled trials and the cohort studies for the smallest preterm infants, including unweighted totals and percentages.96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114 Although the level of support is not as compelling as that for larger preterm infants, these data suggest potential benefit and certainly no convincing evidence of harm for this population.",
