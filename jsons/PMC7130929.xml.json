The discipline of infectious disease also sought the opportunity for simultaneous antimicrobial susceptibility testing. These dreams have slowly matured into realities. Multiplex arrays are approved or in development for the diagnosis of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections direct from patient specimens with results obtained in under an hour. An array was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August, 2013 that can detect common bacterial and fungal agents of bloodstream infections, as well as several important antibiotic-resistant genes, within about an hour after the culture bottle turns positive. Approaches are being made to organism identification and susceptibility testing directly from a blood sample without the necessity for culture. Microbiology lines are available, starting with automated plate streakers and ending with molecular identification of organisms grown on solid media. Despite these molecular and technological advancements, humans must still view the culture plates, perhaps on a television screen, and select colonies to analyze.",

Thus, this article is a snapshot of rapidly changing diagnostic microbiology laboratory techniques and its clinical applications. Emphasis has been placed on tests with high market share in diagnostic microbiology and on those with technologies that are personally regarded by the authors as particularly interesting. The role of specimen processing in concentrating nucleic acid targets and removing inhibitors of amplification is largely neglected, despite its important role in the sensitivity of the assay. However, many new procedures are automated and include specimen processing as part of a hands-off procedure. Most techniques mentioned here involve real-time PCR (RT-PCR), unless otherwise specified. Because most RT-PCR platforms are closed systems, they decrease the incidence of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, and have allowed many nucleic acid amplification techniques to become commercially available. The authors have also attempted to select current citations to support salient points, and these selections are arbitrary. Failure to mention a publication, technique, or trade name should not be construed as denigrating that article, technique, or manufacturer.",

In the 1980s and 1990s, it was recognized that infection with HPV is necessary but not sufficient for the development of cervical carcinoma. More than 100 HPV genotypes exist, of which 13 are associated with a high risk of cervical carcinoma (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). More than 70% of sexually active women become infected with HPV. Most infections, even with high-risk organisms, resolve without apparent sequalae. Why others progress is still unknown.9 The Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) is FDA approved for primary screening, and to determine whether women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance should be subjected to culposcopy. It may be used with the Cytyc PreservCyt Solution for the Cytyc ThinPrep Pap Test (Hologic).10 In the first step, the patient specimen is allowed to react with a pool of RNA probes designed to hybridize specifically to the DNA of high-risk HPV strains. Antibody to RNA/DNA hybrids coats the wells of a microtiter plate and captures any hybrids. After washing away unbound specimen and reagents, detector antihybrid antibodies, each conjugated with multiple molecules of alkaline phosphatase, bind to each capture target, thereby amplifying the signal. A colorless substrate for the alkaline phosphatase is added and chemiluminescence develops proportional to the amount of second antibody bound.",

            "text": "More sensitive tests, typically involving target amplification, have been devised, but most clinical outcomes data are available with hc2. The need for more sensitivity has been questioned, because hc2 has already been shown to be sensitive, but not highly specific, for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or overt malignancy. The presence of high-risk DNA below the detection limit of hc2 seems to be associated with a low risk for malignancy.9 However, new information suggests that infections acquired in the early years of sexual activity may reactivate with aging.11 If this is supported by further studies, more sensitive assays might be indicated. There is also a suggestion that unusual HPV strains may cause cervical carcinoma or precursor lesions in restricted populations.12 Thus, the strains included in the assay may need periodic review. Amplification techniques are now available which can distinguish HPV-16 and HPV-18 from the other high-risk organisms, which has facilitated targeted follow-up algorithms, and outcomes data are increasing so that this unique probe technique is becoming less common. The use of hybrid capture as the basis a detection system in amplification assays is still possible, and used in some assays; however, it is not considered a method with high sensitivity.",

Affirm detects rRNA from Gardnerella vaginalis, used as an indicator for bacterial vaginosis (BV), C albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis. The sensitivity has been adjusted to avoid giving positive results with low concentrations of G vaginalis and C albicans, which often colonize the normal vagina using a lateral flow immunochromatographic enzyme assay. This assay maintains low sensitivity (requiring about 5000 copies of trichomonas nucleic acid to give a positive result), which may be ideal for Gardnerella but bad for Trichomonas species. It is formatted to be performed in a cassette superficially resembling the lateral flow tests used for the serologic detection of influenza or rotavirus antigens and was the first FDA-approved molecular test based on lateral flow. The methodology for lateral flow is as follows: after collection on a proprietary swab, the specimen is lysed to release the nucleic acids, buffered to stabilize the nucleic acids and establish stringency, and added to the cassette, which is incubated at the proper temperature for nucleic acid hybridization. The cassette contains 5 \u201cbeads,\u201d each coupled to a capture probe: 1 for each of the 3 analytes, plus positive and negative controls. Next, enzyme-linked detector probes bind to specific sequences on the target organism\u2019s rRNA. Unbound sample components and probes are washed away. A colorless substrate is converted to a blue product if sufficient target and detector probe have bound. A blue \u201cbead\u201d indicates a positive result.17\n",

The Affirm test has highlighted the fact that multiple infections are common. The role of the VPIII in the diagnosis of BV is the subject of debate, however, because the use of G vaginalis alone as an indicator of BV is not optimal. In addition, there have been criticisms of the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay, particularly for T vaginalis, and of the inability of the assay to highlight the presence of drug-resistant Candida spp. Automated NAAT assays (including the MAX Vaginal Panel assay by Becton Dickinson) resolve many of these problems.

Testing a pool of samples from up to 16 blood donor units is approved for blood bank testing. Recently, the FDA approved the inclusion of hepatitis B virus in this assay, and it has been renamed Ultrio Plus. It contains several HIV targets that allow it to detect HIV-1 (several strains) and HIV-2. Because test results are generally negative and high sensitivity is necessary, the inclusion of an internal control is essential.

When activated by incident ultraviolet light, the first fluorophore emits energy at an unmonitored wavelength. If the second probe is bound adjacent to it, the energy is transferred to the second fluorophore, which then emits light at the wavelength monitored by the sensor. At the end of the PCR assay, a melting curve for the amplicon\u2013probe complex can be generated. The melting temperature is characteristic of each amplicon\u2013probe combination. If there is a mismatch between the probe and the amplicon, the melting temperature decreases.28 The melting temperature difference has been exploited in a test that distinguishes between herpes simplex 1 and 2 (Roche). The PCR primers bind sequences common to both viruses within the HSV DNA polymerase gene. The amplicon detector probes match the HSV-2 sequence, which differs from that of HSV-1 by 2 bp. Melting curve analysis reveals a reproducible melting temperature for HSV-2 that is about 10\u00b0C higher than that exhibited by HSV-1.29 Occasional mutant HSV strains have been detected that have intermediate melting temperatures. These tests can be reported as positive for HSV, but the type is not clear. Types 1 and 2 could be distinguished by sequencing the amplicons, by using an assay using a different target sequence, or by the melting temperature of the amplicon, which is said to be 0.9\u00b0C higher for the HSV-2 variant than the type 1 variant.30\n",

MultiCode RTx assays use 2 unusual nucleotide bases iC (2-deoxy-5-methylisocytidine) and iG (2-deoxyisoguanoside) that base pair only to one another and that are efficiently incorporated into PCR products. iG is put at the 5\u2032 end of the RTx primers along with its linked fluorophore. The reaction mix contains iC covalently linked to a quencher. In the initial cycle amplification, the iG, with its attached fluorophore, appears at the 5\u2032 end of the primer and hence at the 5\u2032 end of the nascent amplicon strands. When these serve as templates for copying in the other direction, an iC, with its attached quencher is added to the 3\u2032 end of the new strand, opposite the iG and its fluorophore. The approximation of fluorophore and quencher decreases the fluorescence. In melting curve analysis, fluorescence increases as the amplicons melt, and the melting temperature allows determination of the nature of the analyte.31\n",

Time-consuming correlations between viral load and prognosis have to be redone for each new, more sensitive assay. Sequence differences between the numerous organism strains and the inherent mutability of the organisms also make accurate quantification difficult, especially for RNA viruses, such as HIV and HCV. One must target a stable sequence. However, the viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error prone and lack proofreading activity. Changes in the genetic sequence, particularly in the primer or probe-binding sites, may reduce the detected viral load.

            "text": "Interest has also recently been generated in the possibility of using Raman spectroscopy for the rapid identification of a variety of bacteria. Raman spectroscopy uses the interaction of light with molecules to measure functional group vibrations. When photons from an incident, focused laser interact with a molecule, they cause the molecule to transition to an excited vibrational state, accompanied by a corresponding energy loss in the photon; this energy loss results in the light undergoing a frequency shift, and hence a change in color, which is measured. The spectrum is unique for each bacterial species. It can be checked against a database for rapid identification of the pathogen. Raman spectroscopy is distinct from other current techniques because of its ease, low cost, and high speed. It provides information on the chemical composition and the structure of biomolecules within the microorganisms. Thus, slight changes in the chemical makeup of organisms can be determined by Raman spectroscopy and used to differentiate genera, species, or even strains. A study by Chouthai and colleagues,53 showed reliable, rapid, and accurate identification of Candida species using Raman spectroscopy. Detection of pathogens is possible from complex matrices, such as soil, food, and body fluids. Further, spectroscopic analysis may allow determination of the effect of antibiotics on bacteria.53, 54, 55\n",

A beam suspended at 1 end resonates at a specific frequency. If a mass is added to the beam, the resonant frequency decreases an amount related to the added mass. The beam is suspended in a vacuum and the bacteria, in growth medium, pass through a microchannel in the beam. This technology has been developed into the Life Scale Biosensor, which can make these determinations in a standard 96-well plate, including the minimum inhibitory concentration plates prepared by Sensititre (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Individual bacteria can be enumerated and their individual masses rapidly determined (in femtograms 10\u221215 g) can be determined rapidly as they pass through the microchannel in the beam. Two posters were presented at the 2016 ASM Microbe to demonstrate proof of concept. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using multiple gram-negative organisms that are generally used in clinical laboratories as antibiotic susceptibility testing control organisms. Resonant mass measurement and standard laboratory antibiotic susceptibility testing results were compared. More than two-thirds of these antibiotics demonstrated 100% essential agreement with the standard results after 3 hours or less, whereas the standard techniques required 16 to 24 hours. Two antibiotics were in less than 90% categorical agreement and required a longer incubation time. The results indicate that a rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing based on resonant mass measurement produces reliable antibiotic susceptibility testing results on gram-negative strains. Ongoing investigations are planned to extend these results to gram-positive strains and to validate the method on clinical samples from positive blood cultures.58, 59\n",

Lakes, CA) blood culture system provides organism detection and identification while the etiologic agent of sepsis is growing in a modified blood culture bottle and does so more rapidly than detection alone can occur in similar comparator blood culture bottles. When bacteria grow, they produce characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOC) that accumulate in the head gasses above the culture medium in the bottle; the spectrum of VOC produced is characteristic of a given genus and species of bacteria. An inexpensive, disposable array can be substituted for the top of a bottle or built into a proprietary bottle. This array consists of chemical indicators that change color differently when exposed to the VOC mixtures, allowing for the determination of the VOCs released. The first instrument using this technique was shown in Amsterdam at European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 2016. In a proof-of-principle paper, Lim and colleagues60 demonstrated that the SpecID fingerprint can detect and identification the VOC fingerprints of organisms in pure culture with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 99.4%, respectively. It could distinguish between strains of S aureus, suggesting that it may be used for epidemiologic purposes as well. Furthermore, detection was rapid, with organism identification with the arrays detecting growth almost 2 hours faster than the standard system.

            "text": "The T2 biosystem is recognized in the US market for their FDA-approved assay for the diagnosis of candidemia directly from a blood sample of a patient in about 5 hours. T2-weighted MRI is a small instrument that uses PCR, followed by hybridization on probe-decorated nanoparticle microclusters. Hybridization will induce changes in magnetic resonance signals, resulting in rapid identification of candida. One of the important features of this technique is direct use of blood samples by the instrument without any prior processing steps. It also benefits from high sensitivity that enables the system to detect a few CFU per milliliter of the target in whole blood. In a report from Mylanakis and colleagues,68 the performance of T2 system for rapid detection of Candida species directly from the bloods of patients with suspected candidemia was evaluated. The report indicates that T2-weighted MRI demonstrated an overall specificity per assay of 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.1%\u2013 99.6%) with a mean time to a negative result of 4.2 \u00b1 0.9 hours. Subanalysis yielded a specificity of 98.9% (95% CI, 98.3%\u201399.4%) for C albicans/Candida tropicalis, 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7%\u201399.6%) for Candida parapsilosis, and 99.9% (95% CI, 99.7%\u2013100.0%) for Candida krusei/Candida glabrata. The overall sensitivity was found to be 91.1% (95% CI, 86.9%\u201394.2%) with a mean time of 4.4 \u00b1 1.0 hours for detection and species identification. The subgroup analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI, 85.4%\u201396.6%) for C albicans/C tropicalis, 94.2% (95% CI, 84.1%\u201398.8%) for C parapsilosis, and 88.1% (95% CI, 80.2%\u201393.7%) for C krusei/C glabrata. The LOD was 1 CFU/mL for C tropicalis and C krusei, 2 CFU/mL for C albicans and C glabrata, and 3 CFU/mL for C parapsilosis. The negative predictive value was estimated to range from 99.5% to 99.0% in a study population with 5% and 10% prevalence of candidemia, respectively.68 The T2 bacterial panel is another assay for detection of bacterial pathogens directly from the blood of patients with suspected bacteremia/sepsis. It can detect Escherichia coli, K pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, A baumannii, S aureus, and Enterococcus faecium and is expected to be FDA cleared by 2018. The usefulness of this system in the clinical setting and its potential impact on patient outcome await data from clinical studies.",

The LOD was determined to be approximately 1 CFU/mL for the various cell types. This low LOD is consistent with pathogen concentrations typically found in infected whole blood samples. For this dataset, detection was made at 100% of the time for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E faecium, C albicans, and C glabrata down to 1 CFU/mL. For S aureus, detection was made at 100% of the time at or greater than 2 CFU/mL and greater than 80% of the time for 1 CFU/mL. However, less than 100% detection of S aureus was at least partly attributable to the inherent difficulty and accuracy associated with spiking certain gram-positive bacteria at very low concentrations. The Qvella blood identification system is designed to detect more than 90% of pathogens isolated from patients with sepsis. Clinical trial of this system is expected to start in the second quarter of 2018.",
