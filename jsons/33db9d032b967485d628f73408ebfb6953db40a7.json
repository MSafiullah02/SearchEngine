There is no drug or vaccine for human and animal coronavirus. The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19. The 3CLpro (Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response. This work presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme complex. Molecular docking study carried out using Autodock Vina. By screening several molecules, we identified three candidate agents that inhibit the main protease of coronavirus. Hispidin, lepidine E, and folic acid bound tightly in the enzyme, strong hydrogen bonds have been formed (1.69-1.80\u00c5) with the active site residues. This study provides a possible therapeutic strategy for CoViD-19.",

The binding affinity was -6.9 to -5.7 Kcal/mol except DHPEHP where the binding affinity was -7.2, but the length of the hydrogen bonds was always bigger than 2\u00c5. No hydrogen bond was formed with colchicine, Harmaline, Harmane, Harmine, Harmol, Methoxy, and Norharman.",

A number of 1903 drugs were tested as the Mpro inhibitors in a preprint manuscript, among them, Nelfinavir was proposed to be potential inhibitor against 2019-nCoV [45] . In another study, it was found by screening 8,000 clinical drug libraries that 4 small molecular drugs have high binding capacity with the main protease [46] . No binding manner or hydrogen bonds formation with active site residues has been discussed in these studies. It was declared that 10 commercial medicines may form hydrogen bonds with key residues of 2019-nCoV main protease [47] . According to articles published in Nature Communications and Nature reviews drug discovery (Sheahan et al, 2020 and Guangdi et al, 2020) [48, 49] , currently, only four drugs (Ritonavir, Darunavir, cobicistat, and ASC09F) are considered for treatment of 2019-nCoV as 3CLpro inhibitors. Through this study, we recommend to enter these molecules (Hispidin, Lepidine E and Folic acid) in the therapy of this disease especially that the studied molecules are known and all the necessary clinical experiments are already done, for the natural compounds, they are used in folk medicine to treat several diseases.",

The potent metabolites hispidin and folic acid that inhibits the main protease of 2019-nCoV might be an effective strategy to treat 2019 novel coronavirus infected individuals. Those natural molecules also might become drug candidates as anti-CoViD-19 drug. ",
