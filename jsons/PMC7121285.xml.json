            "text": "A few hundred bacterial cells obtained by touching a bacterial colony with a sterile toothpick can be used directly in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification procedure to identify and orient a plasmid insert (1,2). By combining this procedure with one in which asymmetrically amplified DNA is used for sequencing (ref.3 and Fig. 1), we have demonstrated that DNA amplified from a bacterial colony can be sequenced directly by the dideoxy chain-termination method to yield results as good as those obtained when purified template DNA is used for amplification (ref.4and Fig. 2). By end-labeling the primer that is used in limiting amounts during the amplification step and using it for sequencing, an entire insert of 300 nucleotides or less can be sequenced in one step. Inserts of larger size can be sequenced by using labeled primers that bind within the amplified single-stranded DNA sequence. The procedure is rapid and enables one to obtain sequences from as many as 20 clones in a single day.",

However, we have used many other primers successfully (ref. 7 and data not shown).The concentration of dNTPs in the asymmetric PCR was kept low (20 \u03bcM each) so that residual amounts would not interfere with dideoxynucleotide chain termination reactions (Innis et al., ref. 3). We have learned that when residual amounts do cause a problem (i.e., when short termination products cannot be seen on the sequencing gel), generally as a result of short (<200 nucleotides) inserts in the clone, two approaches can be used to solve this problem: (1) Additional cycles of the PCR (50-60 total) can be run to deplete the dNTPs and (2) The product from the asymmetric reaction (Section 3.1., step 6) can be passed through a BioSpin 6 column.\n",
