From the perspective of the green transformation of industries, thanks to prominent green input and green benefits, Shenzhen ranked No. 1 among the five major special economic zones in the capability for the green transformation of industries. The score obtained by Shenzhen in green input was nearly 7 times Hainan's score, while Shenzhen's score in green benefits was nearly 30 times and 11 times Hainan's score and Shantou's score, respectively.

This was mainly because those special economic zones were mostly in the industrialization or post-industrialization process; the advantages of the scale of new and high-tech and service industries had yet been fully tapped, and it was difficult for Shenzhen to maintain rapid growth on a large scale after many years of development; Shenzhen lagged behind Xiamen and Shantou in green control; Zhuhai was better than Shenzhen in green environment.

Only when innovation-driven development is strengthened can the green benefits from industrial development gradually become apparent. Zhuhai, Shantou and Hainan enjoy certain advantages in some fields relating to green input, green production, green control, green benefits and green environment, but they have a great gap with Shenzhen and Xiamen in the overall score. In order to narrow the gap more rapidly with Shenzhen and Xiamen in key links, it is necessary for them to take comprehensive measures to further develop green industries, optimize their industrial structure, increase their technical level and extend their industrial chain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Eliminate the Weaknesses in the Green Transformation of Industries, Enhance the Capability of the Special Economic Zones for Green Transformation"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "The building of the green industry evaluation indicator system based on cluster-grey correlation analysis", "authors": [{"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Gu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Shi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Chi", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Resource Development & Market", "volume": "", "issn": "4", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of Hainan's National Economic and Social Development", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of Shantou's National Economic and Social Development", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of Shenzhen's National Economic and Social Development", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of Xiamen's National Economic and Social Development", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of Zhuhai's National Economic and Social Development", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Building model of green industry evaluation indicator system based on factor analysis and empirical research", "authors": [{"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Zhou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Chi", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "Journal of Systems & Management", "volume": "", "issn": "2", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Evaluation research on regional green industrial development effects", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Zhu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Ma", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "Research on Economics and Management", "volume": "", "issn": "3", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Evaluation and analysis of green industrial development based on the grey entropy decision-making model-Take Fujian as an example", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Zhu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Hu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Q", "middle": [], "last": "Yao", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Logistics Engineering and Management", "volume": "", "issn": "1", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}}, "ref_entries": {"FIGREF0": {"text": "In 2015, 2.84 billion yuan were invested in environmental protection.
