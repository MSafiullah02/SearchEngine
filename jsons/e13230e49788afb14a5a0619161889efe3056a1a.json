The most direct method was to calculate the least-squares line of best fit for all the individuals' test values for the duration of the study. This method was sensitive to acute changes in function, but was not expected to detect long-term changes. The most complex method for calculating the expected rate of decline of function for each individual was the derivation of an equation based on a step-down regression analysis of the effect of 22 independent variables on the rate of decline of pulmonary function [27] . This equation was able to explain only 25% of the observed variation in individuals and was therefore discarded.

It should be noted that the control intervals used in the empirical randomization analysis were selected only to be free of infections with the particular virus under analysis, and that other respiratory illnesses and viral infections occurred throughout these control intervals. We tried a separate empirical randomization analysis in which simulated events were used only when they occurred in a six-month interval that had not been associated with any known viral infection. This analysis led to somewhat greater differences between Dr and D s, but because many fewer control intervals were available, there was no effect on the statistical significance. There were other arbitrary, but we hope reasonable, choices made regarding the specific ways the simulation approach was used.

However, because at least 50070 of such illnesses cannot be associated with a known infectious agent [7-9}, we elected to study only those illnesses that were associated with laboratoryproven viral infections.

These viruses typically affect the lower respiratory tract during primary infections in childhood, whereas reinfections in normal adults usually are confined to the upper respiratory tract [41] . Gross et al. [10] have reported that in patients with COPO parainfluenza virus may be associated with viremia and persistence of the virus in pulmonary secretions for two to five months, findings which suggest an unusual pathogenic potential for this virus in patients with COPO. We found that infection with respiratory syncytial virus was uncommon in patients with COPO, but we did observe some acute adverse effects of infection with respiratory syncytial virus in our patients.

Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with hyperreactive airways may be more sensitive to further bronchospastic effects of viral infections. Because smoking has been associated with an increased rate of pulmonary deterioration in susceptible patients with underlying reactive airways [27, 43] , we expected to confirm the report of Fridy et al.
