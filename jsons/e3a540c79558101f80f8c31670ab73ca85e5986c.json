VLM forms an ionophore that specifically modulates potassium ion transport across biological membranes. [28, 29] Many peptide antibiotics act as ion channels.

Such an NRPS system would contain four distinctive modules. Each module would be responsible for the selection, activation, epimerization (when necessary), and incorporation of a precursor (also called building block: D-Hiv, L-Val, L-Lac, or L-Val) in a linear fashion, to form a tetradepsipeptide basic unit covalently tethered as an ester to the active-site serine of the C-terminal iterative TE domain. Two additional rounds of basic unit buildup would generate a linear 12-building block intermediate stalled on the TE. Subsequently, TE would cleave off the intermediate and catalyze the head-to-tail cyclization to afford the mature VLM product (Scheme 2). Alternatively, a terminal peptidyl carrier protein-condensation (PCP-C) didomain might be substituted for the TE for basic unit buildup and cyclization-a mechanism seen in the biosynthesis of enniatins. [39] Considering that a typical NRPS module is encoded by an average 4.5 kb DNA, the putative VLM NRPS assembly line would be expected to require approximately 18 kb of DNA. Genes involved in regulation and self-resistance would also be antici-pated in the putative vlm gene cluster.

This modular organization is consistent with the biosynthesis of the tetradepsipeptide basic unit D-a-hydroxyisovaleryl-D-valyl-L-lactyl-L-valyl. Module 1 is the initiation module that contains four functional domains, adenylation (A; designated as VLM1A1), hypothetical transaminase (TA), hypo-thetical dehydrogenase (DH 2 ), and PCP. The presence of these two hypothetical domains in module 1 correlates well with a proposed mechanism for the generation of the biosynthetic precursor D-Hiv (Scheme 3). According to a study of enniatin biosynthesis in Fusarium sambucinum, D-Hiv was postulated to be derived from L-Val by sequential transamination (catalyzed by an uncharacterized TA) and dehydrogenation (catalyzed by a purified discrete D-Hiv DH 2 ). [44] Generation of precursor D-Hiv in VLM biosynthesis might follow the same route, catalyzed by discrete TA and DH 2 enzymes yet to be discovered, or by the integral hypothetical TA and DH 2 domains in this module. Module 2 contains four standard NRPS domains: C, A (designated as VLM1A2), PCP, and epimerase (E). Module 3 contains four domains: C, A (designated as VLM2A3), hypothetical DH 2 , and PCP. This hypothetical DH 2 domain is speculated to act as a L-lactate dehydrogenase to convert pyruvate into L-Lac which is then acylated onto PCP (Scheme 3). [44] Generation of lactate from pyruvate is a common biochemical reaction in many microorganisms that undergo fermentation. However, dedicated L-Lac DH 2 has not been characterized from any known natural product biosynthetic pathway. Module 3 is split into two proteins, a phenomenon increasingly found in natural product biosynthetic pathways.

Phylogenetic display of the alignment indicates that VLM1A1 and VLM2A3 form a distinctive branch whereas VLM1A2 and VLM2A4 cluster with GrsA_A, which serves as a model A domain with a defined substrate specificity for Phe and a known structure; [47] DhbE, a stand-alone A domain which activates the carboxyl acid DBH (2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid) from the bacillibactin biosynthetic pathway, [48] is distantly related to all of them. At substrate specificity level, VLM1A2 and VLM2A4 contain conserved NRPS codes [49, 50] (DALWLGGTFK and DAFWVGGTFK, respectively) that are predicted to specify for L-Val. In contrast, extracted NRPS codes from VLM1A1 or VLM2A3 (AALWIADSGK or VVIWIAEQHK, respectively) do not yield any predictable substrate. Remarkably, both VLM1A1 and VLM2A3 have the highly conserved Asp at position 235 (first position in the NRPS codes; numbered by GrsA_A sequence) replaced by an Ala or Val. Similarly, DhbE also has the conserved Asp residue replaced by an Asn. This finding suggests that VLM1A1 and VLM2A3, together with DhbE, might represent a divergent group of A domains that specify for a class of hydroxyl acid substrates other than proteinogenic amino acids or carboxyl acids. In the proposed model for VLM biosynthesis (Scheme 2) module 1 and 3 are responsible for the incorporation of D-Hiv and L-Lac, respectively. The A domains in these two modules might have adapted themselves to select and activate hydroxyl acids. The fact that D-Hiv and L-Lac were identified by feeding experiments as the biosynthetic precursors for VLM biosynthesis [25] [26] [27] supports the hypothesis that both D-Hiv and L-Lac might have been synthesized from the VLM assembly line before being activated by their respective A domains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 632, "end": 636, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[49,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1817, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1827, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "Additional biochemical experiments are needed to prove the VLM1A1 and VLM2A3 substrate specificities for D-Hiv and L-Lac, respectively. Immediately following module 4 is a C-terminal iterative TE domain (designated as VLM2_TE). Terminal TE domains are known to control the termination, release, and cyclization of growing chains in the biosynthetic process of many nonribosomal peptides and polyketides. [51, 52] An unsolved mystery regarding the biosynthesis of symmetric cyclo(depsi)peptides is the control of repetition of the basic units. As shown in Scheme 1, VLM contains a three-repeating sequence of a tetradepsipeptide basic unit (designated as a 3 4 mode), whereas montanastatin (C 36 H 60 N 4 O 12 , M W = 740.9) [18] contains the exact same tetradepsipeptide basic unit that repeats only twice (a 2 4 mode). This observation raises the question of whether VLM and montanastatin are produced by the same biosynthetic pathway with relaxed control of basic unit repetition, or by two independent pathways, each of which has a stringent control of basic-unit repetition. A low level of montanastatin was detected by LC-MS in the wild-type strain of S. tsusimaensis but not in the St-nrps \u00c0 mutants. This result suggests that montanastatin is likely the shunt product of VLM, produced by the same VLM biosynthetic pathway with a relaxed TE control of basic unit repetition. In comparison to VLM and montanastatin, enniatin A has a 3 2 mode, whereas cereulide and PF1022A have a 3 4 and 2 4 mode, respectively. Not included in Scheme 1 are additional known symmetric nonribosomal peptide natural products-bacillibactin, enterobactin, and gramicidin S [39] -which have a 3 2, 3 2, or 2 5 mode, respectively. Iterative TE domains in the pathways for the biosynthesis of these symmetric oligomeric products are believed to hold the basic unit until an appropriate number of units are condensed and then proceed with cleavage and cyclization. [51] However, the exact mechanism of controlling the number of repetitions remains unknown. An amino acid sequence alignment (data not shown) of VLM2_TE with DEBS3_TE (accession no. Q03133), SrfA-C_TE (accession no. Q08787), Bs-EntF_TE (accession no. P45745), Ec-EntF_TE (accession no. P11454), CesB_TE (accession no. AY691650), and GrsB_TE (accession no. P14688) showed that VLM2_TE contains a standard catalytic triad, Ser80/His207/Asp107 (residues numbered corresponding to those of SrfA-C_TE) and a conserved substrate-binding motif, Gly-Xxx-Ser-Xxx-Gly, where Xxx stands for any amino acid. [53] No residues stand out to suggest a correlation between con-served amino acid residues, domain, or motif, and the unique oligomerization function of VLM2_TE and other TEs (Bs-EntF_ TE, Ec-EntF_TE, CesB_TE, and GrsB_TE) that are from the pathways for the biosynthesis of oligomerized natural products VLM, bacillibactin, enterobactin, cereulide, and gramicidin S, respectively.

The construct was first transformed into E. coli S17-1 cells and then mobilized into S. tsusimaensis cells by conjugation. [56] Four independent apramycin-resistant conjugants were selected and were verified by Southern blot analysis for the correct integration of plasmid DNA into the host chromosome. Wild-type S. tsusimaensis and the four mutants YC02-38a/b/c/d were then grown in the fermentation medium for 6 days at 30 8C; their mycelia and the HP-20 resin were collected by filtration and the whole mass was lyophilized and extracted twice with two volumes of methanol. Methanol extracts were pooled and a portion was further fractionated by an Oasis HLB Plus SPE cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). A fraction eluted by methanol (90 %) was subjected to LC-MS analysis. LC-MS spectra were obtained with an Agilent 1000 LC/MSD Trap SL instrument (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The eluents used contained formic acid (0.1 %) in water (eluent A) or in acetonitrile (eluent B). A 15 min gradient from 10 % eluent B to 90 % eluent B was achieved in a 2.1 110 mm Zorbax SB-AQ column (Agilent) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min \u00c01 .
