The Andersen impactor is known as a standard for culturable bioaerosol analysis.28 Five-minute sampling periods were used. The pump flow rate was adjusted in the bronchoscopy room to 28.3 Lpm using a TSI Mass Flowmeter 4199 (TSI Inc, Shoreview, MN) and checked between patients. The total volume of air sampled was used to calculate the culturable bacterial concentrations. The Andersen samplers were loaded with 90-mm petri dishes containing trypticase soy agar media to which 5% defibrinated sheep blood was added (Oxoid, Ontario, Canada). All dishes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. All colonies were enumerated according to the total count method.29 The limit of detection was 7 CFU/m3 air for the Andersen impactor. The cyclonic Coriolis \u00b5 sampler was used at a flow rate of 150 Lpm. Fifteen milliliters of sterile 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4 (Life Technology, Ontario, Canada), were placed in the conical vials. A sampling time of 10 minutes was used to obtain an adequate detection limit of 1,200 genomes. As with the Andersen impactor, > 1 sample was taken for some patients.",

Although bronchoscopy has been identified as a high-risk procedure for HCWs,10, 15, 35, 36 this recognition had until now been based on risk guesstimate and epidemiologic studies, but actual exposure had never been documented as it is here. Sampling of the ambient air of the 2 bronchoscopy rooms yielded a wide diversity of bacteria. Many sources of bioaerosols were identified, including outdoor air, medical staff, patients, and resuspension from surfaces. During the background and medical procedure periods, the concentrations and diversity of bacteria in the 2 rooms were noticeably different. According to Brandl and Mandal,37 the main factors affecting the levels and diversity of airborne microorganisms in the indoor air of hospitals are the lack of cleanliness of the hospital, human activities, organic materials brought in from outdoors, and the efficiency of the hospital ventilation system. In general, the predominant genera of airborne bacteria reported in hospitals by other researchers are Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium.37, 38, 39 This was confirmed by our study, because at least 1 species of Staphylococcus spp was identified in every sample. Microorganisms from environmental and human sources were anticipated, and their presence was confirmed by our investigations.",

Patients undergoing bronchoscopy cough numerous times, especially when the bronchoscope is being inserted. Because it is well known that coughing produces a high number of aerosol particles,17, 19, 20, 21, 40 it would seem logical to attribute a proportion of the microorganisms found in the ambient air to the patient's respiratory system. Short-term variation in, or sporadic appearance of, specific bacteria cannot be attributed to the HCWs because they are present during all bronchoscopies. Certain bacteria most definitely originate from the patients, such as the Streptococcus pneumoniae found in room B during the second bronchoscopy. The fact that culturable bacteria from patients were found in the air 1.5 m from their mouths indicates that HCWs in closer proximity can be exposed to some pathogenic microorganisms.",

Nosocomial pathogens can persist on inanimate surfaces.41 Like dust, microorganisms deposited on the floor or other surfaces can be resuspended in the air as a result of people moving around, rolling stretchers in and out of the room, or any other air disturbance that might occur.42, 43 Pathogens present in the air can therefore originate from previous patients, which underscores the importance of thorough room cleaning. The higher concentrations measured during the waiting/preparation period may well be explained by bacteria from the floor being resuspended in the air by the rolling of stretchers and by nurses walking around the room during that period.",

Mycobacterium spp and influenza A and B viruses were not detected. Pathogens present in the air are undoubtedly dependent on patient pathology, and the absence of any specific pathogens from the samples collected in this study does not mean they will always be absent. The identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp, and Corynebacterium sp shows that culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora were present in the air of the rooms during bronchoscopy procedures. HCW exposure to bioaerosols needs to be managed by implementation of prevention protocols and by providing them with appropriate personal respiratory protection if necessary. As previously pointed out, the main problem is not the treatment of known tuberculosis patients, but that of patients admitted for other problems with unsuspected or undiagnosed tuberculosis.15, 44 Because HCWs never know what is hiding in the lungs of their patients, emphasis must be placed on prevention and protection.",

In fact, given the distance between the sampling zone and the HCWs, the concentrations measured may well have been reduced as a result of dilution or sedimentation of the particles. The implication is that a sampling zone located closer to a patient's mouth would have revealed higher concentrations and perhaps the presence of other strains of microorganisms. Sample size was also a limitation of the study. Our presence in the room needed to be accepted by the medical staff. Only 1 sampling day was allowed in each hospital, and the number of bronchoscopy procedures was limited on those days. Still, in this study, the number of bronchoscopies necessary to be statistically representative (P \u2264 .05) with an acceptable error of 20% was calculated to be 14.45 Nevertheless, this study still raises concerns about the occupational hazards to which HCWs are exposed. It provides clear evidence of the presence of culturable opportunistic bacteria originating from the respiratory tract of patients in the air of bronchoscopy rooms. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the air of these rooms is to be expected from time to time, depending on patient pathology.",
