Resulting sequences were compared to representative reference sequences of standard HRV genotypes [10, 16] with FASTA [17] using a 95% homology cutoff for genotype determination. Remaining sequences that were unmatched under this definition were then compared with each other to determine sets of sequences with 100% homology but no defined matching genotype. These sequence groups were sequentially numbered as \u201cundetermined genotype\u201d clusters 1 through 6 for HRV-A (Au1 through Au6) and 1 through 4 for HRV-C (Cu1 through Cu6).

The majority of previously conducted comparative studies of HRV-C are among children or adults presenting for ambulatory or hospital-based medical care [15, 18, 20, 21]. In contrast, our study used prospective, active surveillance in a community childcare setting to examine instances of mild to moderate respiratory illness. In this context, we found few differences by HRV species in our analysis, including no differences in fever or healthcare visits and no evidence of increased cough or wheezing among children with HRV-C. A substantial proportion of children with HRV-C were reported to have decreased activity levels during their illness compared to children with HRV-A (40% vs 27%, respectively); however, this did not result in increases in missed childcare or parental absenteeism from work.",

We found no evidence of room-to-room spread of distinct HRV-B genotypes as we did with HRV-A. HRV-B prevalence among asymptomatic children was notably higher (10/32; 31%) than among symptomatic children. This may indicate that HRV-B is less likely to cause clinically significant respiratory illness than HRV-A or -C infections. This finding corresponds with other studies, including a study in patients with HRV illness that found no cases of HRV-B among 22 children [22]. However, given the single time point for asymptomatic swab collection at enrollment, we cannot rule out the impact of larger HRV-B circulation patterns on this difference.",

Our results agree with previous studies detecting HRV through RT-PCR, which have similarly detected HRV in 12%\u201335% of asymptomatic children [5, 23, 24]. Our high rate is unsurprising in this setting given the frequent detection of HRV overall, and the fact that we have documented year-round exposure to HRV in the childcare centers included in the study. Previous studies have shown high rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission between individuals with previous exposure to HRV such as older children and adults [25]. It is likely, given the frequent overall exposure to HRV in childcare attendees, that rates of asymptomatic HRV transmission are high in this setting as well. This high rate of detection of HRV among asymptomatic children, coupled with the frequent coinfection with other viruses observed here, highlights the difficulties with determining the role of HRV in causing the common cold. Even though decades of human challenge studies have demonstrated that experimentally administered rhinovirus results in upper respiratory symptoms and transmissible disease, it is nevertheless difficult in observational studies to determine causation following a molecularly detected HRV. While not possible in the context of our study, evaluations of host response [26\u201328] to both HRV infection and especially HRV coinfections may present a way forward in understanding this complex system, as it has with studies of the microbiome.",

Interestingly, HRV-A12 has been previously identified as a long-shedding strain by a prospective study of HRV infections in healthy young children [29]. Similar patterns of a limited number of apparent highly transmissible strains responsible for a disproportionately high number of infections have been documented in historical studies of HRV epidemiology [3, 30\u201333].

Although our use of weekly sampling allowed us to define the strain-specific duration of HRV in new detail, our finding that most HRV infections last 2 weeks or less indicates that studies with more frequent sampling are needed to fully define the dynamics of naturally occurring rhinovirus infection in young children. This finer level of detail will ultimately be required to describe the transmission networks of HRV in high-prevalence settings, such as childcare or group living environments.
