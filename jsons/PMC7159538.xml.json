            "text": "The discovery of the Tn antigen was a milestone in the history of the glycosciences, and its unusual expression was among the first to be associated with a human disorder. The Tn syndrome or Tn polyagglutinability syndrome was first described in 1957 by Moreau et al.1 They observed an unusual antigen on the erythrocytes of a patient with a rare, acquired hemolytic anemia that was associated with the polyagglutinability of erythrocytes in the cold and independent of the ABO(H) blood\u2010group status.1 It had been shown earlier in 1925 by Huebner2 and also in 1927\u20131928 by Thomsen3\u20135 that stored erythrocytes from normal donors can occasionally become agglutinated. However, that phenomenon was caused by bacterial glycosidases (neuraminidases) that uncovered the carbohydrate T antigen (Gal\u03b21\u20103GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr; Scheme 1), also termed the Thomsen\u2013Friedenreich or TF antigen. This observation itself was seminal in the field, since it led to the discovery of neuraminidase and of the bacterium Vibrio cholera as a source for the enzyme. The exposed T antigen could be bound by preexisting antibodies, as defined in 1930 by Friedenreich.6 By contrast, the Tn syndrome was characterized by the immediate agglutination in the cold of freshly collected blood samples. This agglutination is now thought to result from the presence of circulating cold agglutinins of the immunoglobulin M type. The Tn antigen was subsequently shown to be a truncated form of a major type of glycosylation in animal glycoproteins with the simple structure GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr (Scheme 1). The historical naming of the Tn antigen derived from the observation by Moreau et al. that it was similar yet distinct from the T antigen; hence, the designation \u201cT antigen nouvelle\u201d or Tn antigen.1, 7 In the \u201ccluster of differentiation\u201d nomenclature, the Tn antigen is designated CD175, and its sialylated version (sialyl Tn) CD175s. The disaccharide T antigen is termed CD176.8\u201311\n",

An elegant strategy for Tn\u2010antigen synthesis was devised by Paulsen and H\u00f6lck, who pioneered the use of a nonparticipating azido group at C2 of the GalNAc donor. Thus, 3,4,6\u2010tri\u2010O\u2010acetyl\u20102\u2010azido\u20102\u2010deoxy\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010galactopyranosyl chloride underwent a Koenigs\u2013Knorr type of reaction with N\u2010benzyloxycarbonyl derivatives of serine or threonine in the presence of silver carbonate and silver perchlorate as promoters to form the \u03b1 anomer stereoselectively (Scheme 2 a).22 The C2 azido group was then converted through reductive acetylation into the naturally occurring acetamide group, and the protecting esters were cleaved to generate GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser and GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Thr, respectively. Similar reactions with the Fmoc derivatives of Ser and Thr were described later by Kunz and Birnbach.23 The use of the C2\u2010azido halo donor promotes a highly selective \u03b1\u2010glycosylation reaction. To generate the disaccharide T antigen, the azido group of the first product in Scheme 2 a was reduced, and the sugar was selectively O\u2010deacetylated and benzylidenated to give a derivative that reacted with tetra\u2010O\u2010acetyl\u2010\u03b1\u2010d\u2010galactosylpyranosyl bromide to yield the disaccharide. Subsequent removal of the protecting groups provided the N\u2010acetylated Gal\u2010GalNAc\u2010Ser/Thr building block.",

Over the years, a variety of approaches have been used to detect the Tn antigen. These approaches, each of which has advantages and limitations, may be broadly subdivided into three categories: chemical, lectin\u2010based, and antibody\u2010based. The direct chemical approach typically involves the \u03b2\u2010elimination strategy,14, 15 in which N\u2010acetylgalactosaminitol is generated by alkaline degradation of glycopeptides in the presence of NaBH4 with the simultaneous modification of the linking amino acids (Ser to 2\u2010aminoacrylic acid or dehydroalanine and Thr to 2\u2010aminocrotonic acid). The identification of N\u2010acetylgalactosaminitol by gas chromatography following acetylation, often in association with the detection of modified Ser or Thr amino acids, is taken as chemical evidence for the presence of Tn antigen on glycopeptides or glycoproteins. Although such approaches are appropriate when sufficient amounts of material are available, it is difficult to perform this type of analysis on the small amounts present in cells or tissues. A variation on this strategy has been to use galactose oxidase without prior neuraminidase treatment to oxidize potential nonreducing terminal GalNAc residues in the Tn antigen at the C6 hydroxy group, and then to reduce with radiolabeled NaB[3H]4.43 The presence of radiolabeled GalNAc is then indicative of the Tn antigen. Of course, radiolabeled Gal can also be produced if the nonsialylated T antigen is present.",

            "text": "However, historically the dominant strategies for detecting Tn antigen are lectin\u2010 and antibody\u2010based. A huge number of different GalNAc\u2010binding lectins from plants and animals have been used to explore expression of the Tn antigen. The lectins used include the plant lectins Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA),44\nMarrubium candidissimum agglutinin,45\nMaclura pomifera lectin (MPL),46\nSalvia horminum agglutinin (SHA),47\nSalvia sclarea agglutinin (SSA),48\nSalvia bogotensis lectin,49\nArtocarpus integrifolia lectin (jacalin),50\nBauhinia purpurea agglutinin (BPA),51, 52 the B4 isolectin of Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA\u2010B4),53\nSoja hispida lectin,54\nMoluccella laevis lectin (MLL),55 and the snail\u2010derived Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA).48, 56, 57 The absence of binding of some lectins has also been used to explore the potential expression of the Tn/STn antigens (STn antigen=sialyl\u2010Tn antigen, Neu5Ac\u03b12\u20106GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr). For example, Springer et al. showed that erythrocytes from patients with Tn syndrome had diminished binding to the lectins Vicia graminea and Arachis hypogoea (peanut agglutinin, PNA), which bind to sialic acid and the T antigen,58 respectively. Furthermore, Tn\u2010expressing cell lines, such as Jurkat leukemic cells and human colon carcinoma LSC cells,59, 60 bind well to HPA, but do not bind well to PNA even after desialylation;61 this behavior is consistent with the expression of Tn antigen in those cells. Two of the most common plant lectins used to explore Tn expression are VVA\u2010B4 and HPA. For example, VVA\u2010B4 has been used to explore the expression of Tn antigen in many different cancer cells, including those of the pancreas, breast, lung, and prostate.62, 63 HPA has been widely used since the early 1980s to study Tn\u2010antigen expression. For example, the clonality of the expression of Tn antigen in blood cells was established by Vainchenker et al.,64 who used fluorescently labeled HPA to show expression of the Tn antigen by erythroid and granulocytic cell colonies derived from a patient with Tn syndrome. Tn expression in platelets of a patient with Tn syndrome was also studied by using binding by HPA along with galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4 reduction to identify Tn expression on platelet glycoprotein GPIb.43 However, the use of HPA to identify Tn\u2010antigen expression is problematic, because HPA also binds to the Cad antigen NeuAc\u03b12\u20103(GalNAc\u03b21\u20104)Gal\u03b21\u2010R, blood group A antigen Fuc\u03b11\u20102(GalNAc\u03b11\u20103)Gal\u03b21\u2010R, and Forssman glycolipid.65, 66 In general, most of the plant and animal lectins that bind GalNAc cross\u2010react with nonreducing and terminal GalNAc residues that are either \u03b1\u2010 or \u03b2\u2010linked, as seen for VVA\u2010B4, which also binds Cad (Sda) antigen.67 Thus, studies in which lectins are used to define the expression of the Tn antigen should be carried out cautiously, and evidence should be supplemented by corroborating chemical, immunological, and/or genetic/molecular data.",

It is estimated that 24 unique ppGalNAcT genes occur in the human genome and 18 in that of mice.89\u201391 The human genes are located on chromosomes 1\u20134, 7\u20139, 12, and 18. The ppGalNAcTs are transmembrane proteins consisting of 600\u2013800 amino acids and are thus larger than most other glycosyltransferases. The transferase activity is located in the N\u2010terminal domain, and the C\u2010terminal domain contains an R\u2010type lectin domain.92 Although all ppGalNAcTs (EC 2.4.1.41) seem to catalyze the same general reaction, expression of ppGalNAcT isoforms or isozymes is tissue\u2010specific in adult mammals, and the ppGalNAcTs display distinct, yet overlapping substrate preferences.93 The activity of all ppGalNAcTs (except for T10) appears to be enhanced if there is a Pro residue at the +3 position relative to Ser/Thr. Pro residues at the \u22123, \u22121, and +1 positions enhance activity to various degrees depending on the ppGalNAcT isoforms.94\u201396 The C\u2010terminal R\u2010type lectin domain has some homology to the lectin domain of ricin, which recognizes and binds carbohydrates. It was suggested that the catalytic and the lectin domains of ppGalNAcTs function in concert to direct the selection of glycosylation sites. This proposal is in agreement with a hierarchical addition of core GalNAc residues to the protein.90 Mucin 1 (MUC1), for example, is a protein composed of 1000 amino acids whose molecular mass is increased to over 2 million Da by the addition of hundreds of O\u2010glycans. The extreme efficiency of its O\u2010glycosylation is not only due to the high activity of ppGalNAcTs and their wide distribution along the Golgi apparatus of epithelial cells, but also to their lectin domain. Binding to previously formed glycans by their R\u2010type lectin domain enables these enzymes to slide along the protein and thus more efficiently attach GalNAc to one Ser/Thr residue after another.97\n",

Core 1 glycans are usually either sialylated by ST3Gal\u2010I to yield sialyl\u2010T antigen,101 which can then be further sialylated by ST6GalNAc\u2010III or IV to yield disialyl\u2010T antigen (DiSia3,6Core 1),102 or alternatively, the core 1 O\u2010glycan disaccharide can be modified by ST6GalNAc\u2010II to the 2,6\u2010sialylated core 1 O\u2010glycan (Sia6Core 1),103 or elongated to form extended core 1 O\u2010glycans, or branched by the core 2 \u03b26\u2010GlcNAcT104 to form core 2 O\u2010glycans. The core 3 structure GlcNAc\u03b21\u20103GalNAc\u03b11\u2010Ser/Thr is mostly found in the gastrointestinal tract and is usually elongated to form complex core 3 O\u2010glycans.105 ST6GalNAc\u2010I is expressed at high levels in the bovine submaxillary gland, but is hardly found in other tissues.106 Therefore, STn is not detectable in normal tissues other than the submaxillary gland of cows and sheep. If formed, STn is a terminal structure that is not an acceptor for other glycosyltransferases.",

The T\u2010synthase transfers Gal from the donor UDP\u2010Gal in the presence of a divalent cation to GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr in glycoproteins through the formation of a \u03b2\u2010glycosidic bond to form the core 1 structure, Gal\u03b21\u20103GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr or T antigen. Thus, the T\u2010synthase is an inverting glycosyltransferase, since it forms a \u03b2 linkage from the \u03b1\u2010linked Gal residue in the donor UDP\u2010Gal.107 The enzyme was assayed originally in BHK cell homogenates,108 in crude preparations of pig and rat colonic mucosa,109 and in partly purified form from rat liver.110 The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from rat liver in 2002.100 The purified enzyme is an 84/86 kDa disulfide\u2010bound homodimer, but the 42/43 kDa monomer was observed and was active as well. The reason for the two homodimer forms, which differ in their molecular mass, is unclear. On the basis of the N\u2010terminal sequence of the rat T\u2010synthase, the cDNA for the human T\u2010synthase was cloned.99 It encodes a 363 amino acid (aa) type\u2010II transmembrane protein. Northern\u2010blot analysis revealed that there are two different transcripts of human T\u2010synthase with sizes of 2.0 and 7.0 kb. The transcript of 2.0 kb is probably the mature and active form, as only the 2.0 kb transcript is found in rat testes. Whether the transcript of larger size is just an incomplete splicing form or has its own function is unclear. The orthologues from various species, including chimpanzee, cow, dog, rat, mouse, bird, frog, and zebra fish, as well as the invertebrates Drosophila and C. elegans, were either cloned or identified.111 From their aligned protein sequences, a high homology, especially between the mammalian proteins, was observed. T\u2010synthase is unique in that it shares minimal homology with conserved motifs of other \u03b23\u2010galactosyltransferases. Remarkably, there is only a single gene for T\u2010synthase in humans and other mammals. The human gene (C1GALT1) resides on chromosome 7p14\u2010p13 and consists of three exons, of which the second exon is the largest. Interestingly, mammalian T\u2010synthase is not N\u2010glycosylated, unlike most other glycosyltransferases, which contain N\u2010glycosylation sites in their primary amino acid sequences; by contrast, the T\u2010synthases from C. elegans\n111 and Drosophila\n99, 112 contain N\u2010glycosylation sites.",

We termed these sequences human C1GALT1 pseudogenes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (pC1GALT\u20101, \u20102, \u20103, and \u20104; see the Supporting Information for sequence alignments). In contrast to the functional gene, all pC1GALTs consist of a single \u201cexon\u201d with many missense mutations and DNA\u2010fragment deletions. The sequence of pC1GALT\u20101 on chromosome 5 is the most conserved; it exhibits 93 % identity to the cDNA of C1GALT1. pC1GALT\u20102 on chromosome 12 is 91 % identical to the cDNA of C1GALT1. pC1GALT\u20103 on chromosome 8 is only 80 % identical to the cDNA of C1GALT1. The first 130 bases of pC1GALT\u20103 do not match exon I (220 bp) of C1GALT1, which accounts for the major overall differences between pC1GALT\u20103 and C1GALT1. pC1GALT\u20104 on chromosome 15 is the least conserved with 71 % homology to the functional gene. It lacks the first approximately 100 bp at the 5\u2032 end of exon I and 200 bp in the 3\u2032 portion of exon II. The mutations and deletions in the four pseudogenes result in many stop codons and open\u2010reading\u2010frame (ORF) shifts, which lead to non\u2010ORF DNA sequences. Neither reverse nor complementary sequences of the pseudogenes contain any ORF, which indicates that they are not other genes or parts of other genes and further suggests that they are pseudogenes. Searches of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the database gave three hits that perfectly matched pC1GALT\u20101 and two matches to pC1GALT\u20102. These matches indicate that pC1GALT\u20101 and pC1GALT\u20102 on chromosomes 5 and 12, respectively, are probably transcriptionally active in certain tissues. Given the similarities of the four pseudogenes to human C1GALT1, it is likely that pC1GALT\u20103 and 4 on chromosome 8 and 15 are evolutionarily the oldest, whereas pC1GALT\u20101 on chromosome 5 is the most recent. The \u201csingle\u2010exon\u201d nature of these pseudogenes suggests that they resulted from reverse transcription of the mRNA of human C1GALT1 and subsequent integration into the human genome. The existence of four nonfunctional genes may not only testify to the evolution of human C1GALT1, but may also be important for the regulation of human C1GALT1 expression, particularly as some of these pseudogenes appear to be transcriptionally active.",

The treatment of such cells with a proteasome inhibitor leads to the accumulation of inactive T\u2010synthase protein aggregates. Interestingly, this inactive T\u2010synthase can be co\u2010immunoprecipitated with Grp78, an ER chaperone that binds exposed hydrophobic regions in misfolded proteins. However, the binding of T\u2010synthase to ER chaperones such as Grp78 does not lead to correct folding, and the presence of the functional Cosmc chaperone remains essential.",

Overexpression of MUC1 can interfere with integrin\u2010mediated adhesion to the ECM.261 Alternatively, the glycosylation of MUCs, such as epiglycanin (MUC21),262 may lead to masking of other tumor cell\u2010surface antigens263 so that the immune system does not recognize the cells and tumor proliferation is therefore promoted. Loss of C3GnT in engineered mice leads to decreased expression of MUC2 and susceptibility to colitis and colorectal cancer.124 This observation indicates that mucin glycosylation may have a barrier and protective function. However, it is disturbing that we know so little about the specific requirements and biological roles of distinct glycan structures (core 1 versus core 3) in these large mucins.

The dimeric T\u2010synthase can then move to the Golgi apparatus, where it functions to add galactose residues from the donor UDP\u2010Gal to the Tn\u2010antigen precursor of O\u2010glycans. Normal O\u2010glycans may be sialylated to generate the sialylated core 1 O\u2010glycans, or may be elongated to extended core 1 structures or core 2 O\u2010glycans (see Scheme 3). Right: In the absence of functional Cosmc, the newly synthesized T\u2010synthase in the ER is misfolded, retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the 26S proteasome. The lack of functional T\u2010synthase in the Golgi apparatus leads to expression of the Tn and sialyl\u2010Tn antigens on the cell surface and secreted glycoproteins.61, 83, 134\n",

Typical mucins contain large numbers of Ser, Thr, and Pro residues in the backbone polypeptide and an abundance of GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr modifications. In normal mucins, the GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr residues are modified to contain different core glycans, as shown in Scheme 3. However, upon cellular transformation, the modification of GalNAc\u03b11\u2010O\u2010Ser/Thr may be compromised, and cells may generate tumor\u2010associated mucins containing the tumor\u2010associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) Tn, sialyl\u2010Tn, and T. One mechanism for the expression of the Tn and sialyl\u2010Tn antigens on mucins is the loss of function of the chaperone Cosmc (Figure 1), but other factors could also lead to elevated expression of these TACAs, as discussed in the text.",
