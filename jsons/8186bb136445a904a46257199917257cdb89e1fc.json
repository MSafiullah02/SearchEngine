There were, however, foci of moderate to severely increased FDG activity with an SUVmax of 8.6 (SUVmax ranging from 1.5 to 8.6 in the left lung and 1.2 to 8.3 in the right lung) in both lungs (a, MIP image; b-d, axial fused PET-CT; red arrows) corresponding to the multiple peripheral bilateral pulmonary patchy ground-glass opacities on CT (e-g, axial CT; green arrows) with hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax of 4.5). Despite lack of typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the morphological pattern on computed tomography was highly suggestive of a COVID-19 infection, given the recent outbreak of this novel coronavirus globally [1] .",

Four days later, the suspicion of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lung infections was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction showing COVID-19. Increased FDG activity has been recently reported in COVID-19 pulmonary infection [2, 3] . However, in this case, the patient did not have any specific symptoms to suggest a COVID-19 infection. With the pandemic status of COVID-19, it is not unexpected that patients with cancers who are referred for [18F]FDG PET-CT have already been exposed to or contacted this virus. Therefore, nuclear medicine centers should follow institutional screening processes and should follow their jurisdictional safety recommendations when scanning any potentially infected COVID-19 patients (https:// www.who.int/publications-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-outbreak-rights-roles-and-responsibilities-of-healthworkers-including-key-considerations-for-occupational-safetyand-health, https://www.eanm.org/covid19-info-centre/).
