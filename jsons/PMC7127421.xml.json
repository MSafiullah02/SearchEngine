Hospital-based physicians and nurses (hereafter called health professionals) in critical care also regularly deal with dying patients, severe injury and threat. After a critical incident, the immediate stress reactions enable health professionals to adequately deal with these situations, but a prolonged stress response could eventually cause health problems (Selye, 1976).",

Strictly speaking, in the first month after a critical incident, post-traumatic stress symptoms do not allow a PTSD diagnosis. From two days to four weeks after a critical incident, severe post-traumatic stress symptoms refer to acute stress disorder (ASD), that requires at least 3 dissociative symptoms, together with marked avoidance and arousal, whereas the PTSD diagnosis is more strict with regard to the number of avoidance/numbing symptoms (at least 3) and arousal symptoms (at least 2), but requires no dissociative symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, American Psychiatric Association, 2011, Bryant et al., 2010).",

However, the threatening aspect of the stimulus is maintained in defensive coping, which is often reported after critical incidents, such as withdrawal, or denial (Acker, 1993, Birmes et al., 1999). Though in the short-term defensive coping can be protective against overwhelming emotions, it ultimately has been proven to be ineffective and may prevent normal recovery (Ehlers and Clark, 2000, Gersons and Olff, 2005). In turn, enduring post-traumatic stress responses cause many health professionals to reduce their work hours or even to switch jobs (Laposa and Alden, 2003, Laposa et al., 2003). Additionally, poor and non-empathic behavior toward patients may also originate in traumatic experiences (Jonsson et al., 2003).",

In a study among emergency room, intensive care, and general floor nurses, however, none of them was in the clinically significant range for PTSD (Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004). In a third study among emergency medicine residents in four different stages of their training, 11.7% met PTSD criteria and 30% had one or more symptoms in all three symptom clusters; in all clusters, the number of symptoms significantly increased with years of experience (Mills & Mills, 2004).",

In addition, several situational and personal factors may have contributed to the mental health effects found in previous studies. In an extensive review, three factors consistently contributed to development of PTSD: a psychiatric history, childhood abuse, and a family psychiatric history. Factors like gender, age, and race are related to PTSD in some populations but not in others, while socio-economic status, education, intelligence, previous trauma, childhood adversity, trauma severity, social support, and life stress predict PTSD more consistently across different populations, but to a varying extent. Overall, factors operating during or after the incident, like trauma severity, lack of social support and additional life stress have somewhat stronger effects than pre-trauma factors (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). None of the studies in the latter review, however, comprised mental health effects of potentially traumatizing incidents that are part of health professionals\u2019 jobs.",

Hospital administrators as well as health professionals themselves often seem to underestimate the impact of critical incidents on their personal and occupational life. The same phenomenon was observed among medical students with a near 15% rate of moderate to severe depression; possibly partly resulting from work-related critical incidents. Despite seemingly good access to health care, the depressive students hesitated to seek counseling because they feared this would indicate inadequate coping skills. Besides, they thought that if they would seek help others might question their ability to handle responsibilities, disrespect their opinions, and regard them as dangerous to their patients (Schwenk, Davis, & Wimsatt, 2010). These stigmatizing perceptions may be common with respect to post-traumatic stress symptoms in other health professionals as well, and underlie their denial, that seems even stronger than among firefighters and police officers.",

We also manually searched the reference lists from relevant publications, and the Journal of Traumatic Stress (special issues included). Finally, we screened the European Traumatic Stress Research Database for relevant ongoing studies. Inclusion criteria for eligibility were as follows: peer reviewed articles; published from inception to 2009; written in English, French or German; based on original research; and included a clearly defined control group. If more than one study reported on the same data, the paper with the most complete and relevant information was selected. Excluded were studies with military or mental health providers representing the high-risk group and articles that primarily reported on secondary traumatic stress, vicarious trauma, or compassion fatigue.",

Observed heterogeneity initiated further analyses in an attempt to explain the findings. Ideally, there is no heterogeneity at all (I\n2 = 0). When heterogeneity is high, the analytical approach requires applying a random effects model, which involves the assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not identical.

Another paper was excluded because additional data could not be obtained from the author. Two studies reported on the same data, so the paper with the most complete and relevant information was selected. Consequently, 10 articles remained from the initial search for meta-analysis.

These ten studies reported on the effects of treating SARS patients, treating victims of terror, or treating patients in critical care units with high morbidity and mortality. The outcomes reported for post-traumatic stress symptoms are consistent with effects reported in ambulance and emergency workers (Alexander and Klein, 2001, Jonsson et al., 2003, Marmar et al., 1996). For example: in an empirical study on ambulance workers (Alexander & Klein, 2001), means (and SD) on the Impact of Event Scale was 15.5 (15.7) after a work-related disturbing incident, compared to 19.8 (13.4) in a study among nurses who treated SARS patients (Chen et al., 2005). One study on the effect of critical incidents (Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004) had inconsistent results (SMD = \u2212.26). In this study however, the observed negative effect implies that critical incidents not only have an impact on critical care nurses, pooled for intensive care unit and emergency department, but also on the control group comprising general floor nurses, and that the impact on general floor nurses may even be larger. Comparison of the three separate groups showed that both emergency and general floor nurses had higher scores than intensive care nurses, although this difference was not significant. We hypothesize that working in a highly structured ward and being well trained and prepared, as intensive care nurses are, may reduce the impact of critical incidents. In general medicine however, these incidents are less common, and thus relatively unexpected and potentially more influential. Uncommonness of critical incidents does not explain any difference between intensive care and emergency nurses, but unexpectedness may also play a more prominent role in the emergency nurses. However, in the other study comparing intensive care nurses and general medical/surgical nurses (Mealer et al., 2007) being an intensive care nurse was the only variable that remained significantly associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms after controlling for confounding variables.",

In the latter study, all nurses had elevated depression scores, but both general floor nurses and emergency nurses had significantly higher scores for depression than intensive care nurses. Hence, in critical care nurses the effect of critical incidents in general on anxiety and depression is not unambiguous and needs further study. Overall, the mental health effects of treating SARS patients are fairly straightforward. The somewhat ambiguous effects of more regular critical incidents however were confounded by the control group chosen, which appeared not to be \u2018low-risk\u2019 at all. The impact of critical incidents on general floor nurses may be at least as big as on emergency and intensive care nurses. In addition, effect sizes could also have been influenced by the questionnaires used; in SARS studies the Davidson Trauma Scale and the Impact of Event Scale (15 and 22 item versions) were used; in the other four studies the PTSD Symptom Scale (modified) and the PTSD 10-Question Survey were used.",

In the remaining studies on the association of treating victims of terror or patients in critical care units, SMDs were remarkably lower for post-traumatic stress symptoms (.19) and even negative for anxiety and depression (\u2212.13 and \u2212.14, respectively). One reason for the larger impact of treating SARS patients may be that, because much about the disease was unknown, health professionals initially were insufficiently equipped to treat these patients. Another explanation may be that the threat of SARS was not restricted to patients, but also involved colleagues, health professionals themselves, and even their family members. Luce et al. (2002) demonstrated that people who were only professionally involved with victims of a bomb attack had much lower scores on the PTSD Symptom Scale than those with both professional and civilian involvement at the same time. These results are consistent with the idea that professionals are resilient to critical incidents to a certain extent. However, personalization and identification with patients or their family members may change their evaluation and thereby change the impact of the concerning incident (De Boer et al., submitted for publication).",

This influence was small in the first 4 weeks after the incident (SMD = .20) (Chan and Huak, 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Kerasiotis and Motta, 2004, Mealer et al., 2007, Styra et al., 2008, Su et al., 2007, Weiniger et al., 2006), compared to medium (SMD = .52) in the period ranging from 4 weeks to 26 months after the incident (Lin et al., 2007, Luce et al., 2002, Maunder et al., 2006, McAlonan et al., 2007). This is remarkable, as short-term effects after critical incidents are often larger than longer-term effects (Bonanno, 2004); also without treatment, most people spontaneously recover over time (Sijbrandij et al., 2007). The cumulative effect of regular exposure to critical incidents possibly contributes to this higher longer-term effect (Michael and Jenkins, 2001, van der Ploeg and Kleber, 2003). An alternative explanation may be that health professionals in the control groups of short-term SARS studies (four of the seven short-term studies) did not treat SARS patients but nevertheless believed that living in a SARS-affected area was very risky. This would reduce the difference between these intervention and control groups. In the long-term studies, health professionals in the control groups of SARS studies (three of four long-term studies) are more likely to be confident that they had been at low-risk during the outbreak.",

Because pre-exposure levels of distress were measured only in some of the included studies, bias may have emerged. Health professionals\u2019 experience and training level can be important in this respect as well. In a study among emergency medical residents, post-traumatic symptoms increased with years of training/exposure (Mills & Mills, 2004), while relatively untrained general floor nurses had more post-traumatic stress symptoms than intensive care and emergency nurses (Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004). The latter result can be compared with findings from the burnout literature, where the incidence of burnout in physicians decreased with age (Peisah, Latif, Wilhelm, & Williams, 2009). This may be due to training and/or professional experience, but may also be a \u2018survivor\u2019 effect; those who had more problems may have left before reaching seniority. In future studies, the influence of these possible mediators in the relationship between critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospital-based health professionals should be established (Fig. 3\n).",

Preventive measures to be taken by supervisors are to acknowledge the need for support and establish a climate that allows workers to express their feelings and health concerns.

In addition, \u2018man-made\u2019 incidents may have higher impact than natural disasters. In a review, prevalence of PTSD after terrorist attacks for example, was estimated to be approximately 28% (Gidron, 2002).

            "text": "Some questions remain to be addressed in future research with proper control groups and longitudinal designs. Firstly, the relative impact of different kinds of incidents needs further research. It seems that treating SARS patients has more impact than other incidents. Effects of rare incidents however are less likely to accumulate than frequently occurring critical incidents. In addition, the smaller effect found for \u2018frequently occurring incident in the critical care environment\u2019 was not in line with the effect found in one study with a control group of general floor nurses who had even higher scores than intensive care and emergency nurses (Kerasiotis & Motta, 2004). Secondly, the varying effects on different health professionals must be further explored. In one study among physicians, effect size for post-traumatic stress symptoms was almost absent (.02) (Weiniger et al., 2006). In another study the frequency of \u2018scores >30\u2019 on the Impact of Event Scale (indicating PTSD) was almost equal between nurses and physicians (19.4% and 18.8% respectively; p = 1.00) (Chan & Huak, 2004). Between nurses and different \u2018other workers\u2019, median scores on the Impact of Event Scale did not differ in one study (p = .16) (Maunder et al., 2006), but differed significantly among (eight) groups in another study (scores on PTSD Symptom Scale; p < .01) (Luce et al., 2002). Thirdly, the relationship of critical incidents with anxiety and depression did not hold in subgroup analysis, and thus requires additional research with subgroups that are large enough to allow firm statistical inferences. Finally, the influence of possible mediators in the relationship between critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms/PTSD in health professionals should be established by including pre-exposure symptom levels, as well as variables that may increase vulnerability like psychiatric (family) history, previous trauma, social support, and additional life stress (Brewin et al., 2000).",
