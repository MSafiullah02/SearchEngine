            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients with high-risk or advanced hematological disorders [1]. An HLA-matched sibling donor is considered the first choice. Approximately 70% of patients do not have a suitably matched sibling donor (MSD) available for transplantation. Alternatives such as matched unrelated donors (MUDs) can be identified for only 50% to 60% of patients, with the donor search and procurement process requiring a median of 4 months [2]. For patients who do not have suitable MSDs or MUDs, alternative stem cell sources include unrelated single or double umbilical cord blood transplants, HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUDs), and HLA haploidentical family members. Despite the expansion of MUD registries and cord blood banks, donor availability can often be uncertain particularly for under-represented ethnic minorities, which may be subject to prolonged and unproductive registry searches [3]. The use of haploidentical donors reduces this uncertainty to a large degree, as almost all patients have an immediately available related donor with whom they share a single HLA haplotype. This not only facilitates a reduced time to transplantation, but also provides a more reliable source of donor stem cells or lymphocytes in the event further interventions are required.",

The combination of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has only been described in the setting of haploHSCT for sickle cell disease [4]. In our institution, we established a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisting of fludarabine (Flu), reduced-dose busulfan (Bu), and total body irradiation (TBI) (total dose 200 cGy) combined with ATG and followed by PTCy and cyclosporine for the prevention of graft rejection and GVHD for haploHSCT recipients. We previously reported the use of this protocol in MUD transplants wherein lower rates of severe acute GVHD were demonstrated compared with non\u2013ATG-based regimens [5]. In the present study, we report the use of this protocol in 50 consecutive patients who underwent haploHSCT at our center.",

            "text": "HaploHSCT was initially described in the late 1950s. This was historically associated with high rates of graft rejection, severe acute GVHD, and worse outcomes when compared with MSD transplants [9]. An important milestone in haploHSCT was the use of T cell\u2013replete grafts in combination with post-transplantation high-dose cyclophosphamide [10]. In the setting of haploHSCT, PTCy decreases the risk of GVHD and graft rejection by targeting and inducing cell apoptosis of alloreactive T cells rapidly proliferating early after transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and preserving nondividing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 10, 11, 12, 13. PTCy may be associated with high rates of severe acute GVHD if used alone, with 4 of 5 patients receiving single-agent PTCy succumbing to fatal, steroid-refractory GVHD in 1 single-center report [14]. Therefore, post-transplant immunosuppression commonly includes additional agents such as calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus, and/or mycophenolate mofetil 13, 14. HaploHSCT using unmanipulated T cell\u2013replete PBSC grafts with PTCy, calcineurin inhibitors, and mycophenolate mofetil as GVHD prophylaxis have been associated with increased rates of acute and chronic GVHD and have shown commensurate outcomes with acceptable NRM when compared with other donor sources 12, 15, 16. ATG has also been extensively studied as a method to prevent graft rejection, acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD in MSD and MUD transplants 17, 18, 19. However, its effectiveness in modulating severe acute and chronic GVHD is offset by a higher rate of infectious complications, including CMV and EBV reactivation 20, 21, 22.",

High incidence of CMV reactivation was noted in our study; however CMV-related mortality was very low. T cell\u2013replete haploHSCT recipients have a lower incidence of infections than T cell\u2013depleted haploHSCT patients do because of improved immune reconstitution; the incidence of CMV reactivation has been reported to be 60% [12]. The best approach to prevent CMV reactivation in the setting of haploHSCT is not well established. The use of novel agents such as letermovir as prophylaxis may be potentially useful avenues of research [28].",

            "text": "EBV-related PTLD after allogeneic HSCT is associated with mortality rates as high as 50% to 90% 29, 30. Based on European data, the incidence of PTLD after allogeneic HSCT was 3.2%, varying from 1.2% in MUDs to 2.8% in mismatched related donors (including haploidentical and mismatched related donors). In the context of ATG-based conditioning, the incidence of PTLD has been reported to be 9.7% [31]. The risk of developing EBV-PTLD is predominantly related to the degree of T cell depletion or impairment, as EBV-infected B cells are held in check by cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. This loss of this mechanism leads to uncontrolled B cell proliferation and the development of PTLD [32]. Although the incidence of EBV reactivation and PTLD in our patients was high, all patients responded well to rituximab monotherapy and no PTLD-related deaths occurred. The observed high rate of EBV reactivation and PTLD may be attributed to T cell impairment between donor and recipient secondary to HLA mismatch, the use of dual T cell depletion with PTCy and ATG, and the high rate of CMV reactivation. Patients were monitored closely with weekly PCR-based testing for EBV. This may have led to a higher rate of detection of EBV reactivation. EBV seromismatch has been described as a risk factor for PTLD development, and the selection of an EBV-matched donor may affect rates of reactivation in a manner similar to CMV [31]. There are no clear guidelines for the monitoring and preemptive treatment of EBV reactivation or PTLD in haploHSCT.",

The focus of this report is to demonstrate the applicability of this novel conditioning regimen in a broad selection of patients. While a longer follow-up would certainly be more informative for outcomes such as chronic GVHD and longer-term complications, the lower incidence of acute GVHD grade II to IV was encouraging. The incidence of NRM was of considerable concern and has been attributed to infective complications, particularly after viral infections. We have implemented a reduction in the ATG dose in an attempt to mitigate the infection risk. Finally, the proportion of older (35% over 65 years of age) patients may explain lower tolerance to infectious and other post-transplant complications. Future modifications to this protocol may also include more aggressive antiviral prophylaxis and therapy.",

This approach produced consistent donor cell engraftment with low rates of acute GVHD; however, this was tempered by high rates of viral reactivation and consequently, NRM. HaploHSCT may be used when a suitable HLA-matched donor is not available or when allogeneic HSCT is needed urgently. Prospective studies are needed to compare the outcomes of different conditioning regimens in haploHSCT and the outcome of allogeneic HSCT using alternative graft sources.",
