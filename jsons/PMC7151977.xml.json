Over the next 50 years, the field of infection control developed slowly, initially focused on surveillance for health care\u2013associated infections (HAIs), then incorporating the science of epidemiology to elucidate risk factors for HAIs. However, three pivotal events signaled the beginning of a new era in health care epidemiology\u2014the Institute of Medicine's 1999 report on errors in health care, which included HAIs1; the 2002 Chicago Tribune expos\u00e9 on HAIs,2 which was the beginning of the mainstream media's interest in this topic; and the publication in 2004 and 2006 of dramatic reductions in bloodstream infection rates by simply standardizing the process of central venous catheter insertion.3, 4 This new era in health care epidemiology is characterized by consumer demands for more transparency and accountability, increasing scrutiny and regulation, and expectations for rapid reductions in HAI rates.5 The paradigm shifted from viewing most HAIs as an unpreventable \u201ccost of business\u201d to the vast majority being preventable. Accordingly, the focus for hospital programs shifted from infection control to infection prevention, which required rapid identification of infections and timely actions to analyze them, as well as playing an active role in the implementation of interventions for infection reduction.",

Once these rates have been established, an outbreak can be identified when its rate of occurrence is significantly higher than the endemic rate. The importance of surveillance was demonstrated nearly 3 decades ago by the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control, which found a 32% reduction in HAIs in hospitals with active surveillance programs compared with hospitals without such programs.8 Data from hospitals in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System demonstrated that from 1990 to 1999, nosocomial bloodstream infections decreased by 44% in medical intensive care units (ICUs), 32% in pediatric ICUs, and 31% in surgical ICUs.9 As hospitals gained experience in standardization of patient care processes (e.g., central venous catheter insertion, head of bed elevation), further reductions in HAIs have been observed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that in the time period 2008 through 2011 there was a 41% reduction in central line\u2013associated bloodstream infections and a 17% reduction in surgical-site infections, with only a 7% reduction in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in the time period 2009 through 2011.10 Over the past several years, many hospitals have begun to monitor compliance with process measures, because feedback to health care workers on compliance with best practices more forcefully drives compliance than simply providing feedback on infection rates.11, 12\n",

These areas include ICUs, cardiothoracic surgery units, and hematology/oncology units. However, with the current scrutiny on HAIs, hospital-wide surveillance (i.e., concurrent surveillance throughout the hospital) is becoming more prevalent and has been mandated in some states. As more hospitals implement electronic medical records, hospital-wide sur\u00adveillance has become less daunting from a resource perspective. For example, collection of device days (denominator data), which previously required a daily review of patients, often by an infection preventionist, can now be accomplished via extraction of data entered into the electronic record by the bedside nurse as part of the daily patient nursing assessment. It is important for hospitals to consider implementing surveillance outside of the ICU setting because the proportion of patients with invasive devices is increasing, and in many hospitals interventions to reduce infection have primarily been targeted to ICU patients. Although the rates of infection may be lower in the non-ICU setting, given that ICU beds typically make up a minority of beds in most hospitals, the burden of infections in the non-ICU setting may actually be higher.",

Although isolation guidelines are based on current understanding of the mechanisms of the transmission of organisms, few well-controlled studies have been performed to demonstrate their efficacy. Because HAIs are relatively uncommon events, any study designed to demonstrate efficacy requires sample sizes that are often prohibitively large. Thus, studies evaluating the efficacy of infection prevention interventions often lack the power to allow one to conclude confidently that there has been a lack of effect (i.e., such studies have a high probability of type II error).",

Conversely, failure to isolate a patient with a transmissible disease may lead to morbidity and mortality and may ultimately be expensive when one considers the direct costs of an investigation of an outbreak and excess length of stay and the indirect costs of lost productivity. The practice of isolating patients has moved from the requirement for separate infectious disease hospitals to separate wards for these patients and, ultimately, to providing precautions in the general hospital environment. In 2006, the American Institute of Architects, in its Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, made single-patient rooms the standard.14 Hospitals that have single-patient rooms exclusively are able to isolate patients with transmissible diseases without disrupting patient flow.15 However, existing facilities often still have a significant proportion of double-patient rooms.",

These expectations, along with continued media attention, have propelled infection prevention programs into a new era of much greater scrutiny and a demand for higher accountability. Despite the increasing severity of illness of hospitalized patients, the greater prevalence of invasive technologies, and a higher prevalence of immunocompromised patients, some are calling for hospital epidemiologists to achieve the goal of eliminating HAIs (getting to zero). It is important that the infection prevention community acknowledge that most HAIs are preventable and respond with a strong commitment to decrease HAIs to the irreducible minimum. However, unreasonable expectations can lead to adverse unintended consequences.45\n",
