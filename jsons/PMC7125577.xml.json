Many emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola hemorrhagic fever, are caused by RNA viruses. Our current knowledge of the diversity of RNA viruses in vertebrates is rather fragmentary and biased. A large proportion of known vertebrate RNA viruses were isolated from humans or species of economical or medical importance, mainly mammals and birds. Relatively few viruses have been documented in other vertebrate species. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, more and more novel RNA viruses have been found through meta-genomic or meta-transcriptomic approaches [1]. Moreover, paleovirological studies discovered a large number of ancient RNA viral relics, namely endogenous RNA viral elements, within vertebrate genomes, providing important insights into the deep history of RNA viruses [2]. However, much remains unknown about the diversity of RNA viruses in vertebrates. A recent study by Shi et al. [3] greatly expands our understanding of the diversity of RNA viruses in vertebrates.",

They identified a total of 214 novel RNA viruses and found that many viral families or genera that had been known to infect mammals, birds, and/or reptiles were also present in fishes and/or amphibians. The identification of these RNA viruses greatly extends the host distribution of vertebrate-associated RNA viruses (Figure 1\n). For example, the host distribution of the Astroviridae family was extended from mammals and birds to nearly all the major lineages of vertebrates; viruses related to influenza viruses were identified in jawless fish, ray-finned fish, and amphibians; the Filoviridae and Arenaviridae families were found to infect fish. Moreover, Shi et al. [3] discovered two novel viral groups that infect vertebrates: one distantly related to Astroviridae and plant viral family Potyviridae and the other falling within the diversity of a putative new viral family Chuviridae that is thought to infect arthropods [4].",

First, RNA viruses underwent more co-divergence with their vertebrate hosts than simply expected by chance; but they also underwent frequent host-switching. Second, the genome organizations among RNA viruses of the same family or genus appear to be generally conserved; but they also exhibit certain degree of variation, ranging from change in genome length to change in segment numbers. Therefore, the evolution of RNA viruses in vertebrates might be more complex than previously appreciated.",

There are several possible evolutionary scenarios: i) RNA virus underwent water-to-land transition simultaneously with the colonization of terrestrial environments by their vertebrate hosts [5]; ii) RNA viruses of fish infected tetrapods through host-switching well after the conquest of land by vertebrates; or iii) tetrapod RNA viruses arose through cross-species transmission from these of non-vertebrate origin. Phylogenetic analyses show that fish viruses tend to fall basal to tetrapod viruses, indicating possibly aquatic origins of tetrapod RNA viruses [3]. However, viruses from lungfish are more closely related to these from ray-finned fish, which is inconsistent with the host evolutionary relationship and thus makes the scenario of simultaneous terrestrialization less likely. However, based on the data available, we still have no definite answer for the mystery of tetrapod RNA virus origin.",

[3] are from China; iv) virus discovery through direct NGS might be inefficient due to low abundance of certain viruses [8]; v) the virus discovery strategy used by Shi et al.
