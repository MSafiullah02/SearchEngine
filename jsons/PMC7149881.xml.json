Not infrequently, within this heritage, there often is a legacy of personal or familial exposure to psychological trauma in the immediate or most distant past, or both. Psychological trauma and PTSD occur across the full spectrum of gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural groups in the United States (Pole, Gone, & Kulkarni, 2008). Psychological trauma and PTSD are epidemic internationally as well, particularly for ethnoracial minority groups (which include a much broader range of ethnicities and cultures and manifestations of PTSD than typically recognized in studies of PTSD in the United States; de Jong, Komproe, Spinazzola, van der Kolk, & Van Ommeren, 2005; de Jong, Komproe, & Van Ommeren, 2003). The scientific and clinical study of PTSD and its treatment among gender and ethnoracial majority and minority groups is of great importance, especially given the disparities, adversities, and traumas to which they have been subjected historically (Miranda, McGuire, Williams, & Wang, 2008)\u2014and to which they are still exposed in health and health care, education and income, and adult criminal and juvenile justice (Ford, 2008).",

In addition, there is sufficient diversity (in norms, beliefs, values, roles, practices, language, and history) within categorical ethnocultural groups such as African Americans or Latinos to call into question any sweeping generalizations about their exposure and vulnerability or resilience to psychological trauma (Pole et al., 2008).",

One partial antidote for this problem is for clinicians and researchers to be curious about these issues and to ask study participants or clinical patients to self-identify their own racial, ethnic, and cultural background and to essentially educate them about their unique characteristics and associated belief systems and traditions (Brown, 2008; Brown, Hitlin, & Elder, 2006). It also is important to carefully assess factors that are associated with differential exposure to adverse experiences (such as racial-ethnic discrimination) or differential access to protective resources (such as income, health care, education, police protection), rather than assuming that each member of an ethnocultural group is identical on these crucial dimensions. However, when systematic disparities in exposure to stressors or deprivation of resources are identified for specific groups, such as persons from indigenous cultures\u2014the original inhabitants of a geographic area who have been displaced or marginalized by colonizing national/cultural groups\u2014are found to have a generally increased risk of discrimination, poverty, addiction, family violence, and poor health (Harris et al., 2006, Liberato et al., 2006), it is crucial not to mistakenly conclude that those persons are less resilient than others when they are confronted with traumatic stressors. Commonly, the very opposite is true: persons and groups who are subjected to chronic stressors or deprivations tend to be more resilient than others, but they also are more exposed to and less protected from traumatic stressors (Pole et al., 2008).\n",

Racism may constitute a form of psychological trauma in and of itself, increasing the risk of exposure to psychological trauma, and exacerbating its impact by increasing the risk of PTSD (Ford, 2008). As of yet, few systematic studies have directly examined racism as a risk factor for exposure to psychological trauma, although the connection is increasingly recognized (Carter & Forsyth, 2009; Hunter & Schmidt, 2010; Miller, 2009). Perhaps, the Holocaust and other forms of genocide have been the most investigated to date. Studies of survivors of the Holocaust and other types of ethnic annihilation provide particularly graphic and tragic evidence of the infliction of psychological trauma en masse in the name of racism (Staub, 2005; Yule, 2000). Studies are needed that systematically compare persons and groups who are exposed to different types and degrees of racism in order to test whether (and under what conditions) racism is a form of, or leads to exposure to other types of, traumatic stressors (Ford, 2008).",

This study more precisely operationalized racism than any prior study, utilizing two psychometrically validated measures of race-related stressors and PTSD. However, as in the Pole et al. (2005) study, the stressors/traumas and PTSD symptoms were assessed by contemporaneous self-report, so the actual extent of racism experienced by the participants cannot be definitely determined. The Loo et al. (2005) study also did not control for traumatic stressor exposure other than that which was related to racism. In order to extend the valuable work these studies have begun, it will be important to utilize measures based on operationally specific criteria for categorizing and quantifying exposure to discrimination (e.g., Wiking, Johansson, & Sundquist, 2004) as a distinct class of stressors that can be assessed separately as well as concurrently with exposure to psychological trauma.",

Racism can also indirectly reduce access to protective factors (adequate nutrition and other socioeconomic and community resources) that protect against the adverse effects of stressors (such as poverty, pollution, disaster) and traumatic stressors (such as accidents, crime, or violence). Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath provided just such an example. It is important to determine whether PTSD is the product of either the direct or indirect effects of racism, or both, particularly given its demonstrated association with other psychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and with increased risk of physical illness (such as cancer and cardiovascular disease) in ethnoracial minorities (e.g., among American Indians; Sawchuk et al., 2005).",

Racial disparities in access to education are due both to direct influences (such as lower funding for inner-city schools that disproportionately serve minority students) and indirect associations with other racial disparities (such as disproportionate juvenile and criminal justice confinement of ethnoracial minority persons). Racial disparities in education are both the product of and a contributor to reduced access by minorities to other socioeconomic and health resources (such as income, health insurance, adequate nutrition) (Harris et al., 2006). When investigating risk and protective factors for PTSD, it is essential therefore to consider race and ethnicity in the context not only of ethnocultural identity and group membership but also of racism and other sources of racial disparities in access to socioeconomic resources.",

When family and community relationships are severed\u2014as occurs with massive political upheaval, war, genocide, slavery, colonization, or catastrophic disasters\u2014racial and ethnocultural groups may find themselves scattered and subject to further victimization and exploitation. For example, there continue to be massively displaced populations in Central and South America, the Balkans, central Asia, and Africa. When primary social ties are cut or diminished as a result of disaster, violence, or political repression, the challenge expands beyond survival of traumatic life-threatening danger to preserving a viable life, community, and culture in the face of life-altering losses and suppression of those very factors needed to maintain (Garbarino and Kostelny, 1996, Rabalais et al., 2002). Ethnoracial groups that have been able to preserve or regenerate core elements of their original cultural norms, practices, and relationships within intact or reconstituted families may actually be particularly resilient to traumatic stressors and protected against the development of PTSD. For example, persons of Asian or African descent have been found to be less likely than those of other ethnocultural backgrounds to develop PTSD. Whether this is due to factors other than ethnicity per se, such as having cultural practices and beliefs that sustain family integrity and social ties, is a question that has not been scientifically studied and should be a focus for research (Pole et al., 2008).",

A culturally competent (Brown, 2008, Brown, 2009, Brown et al., 2009) approach to treating PTSD (Ford, 2008) begins with a collaborative discussion in which the therapist adopts the stance of a respectful visitor to the client\u2019s outer and inner world\u2014clarifying the client\u2019s expectations and preferences, and the meaning of sensitive interpersonal communication modalities (such as spatial proximity, gaze, choice of names, private versus public topics, synchronizing of talk and listening, use of colloquialisms, providing advice or education). PTSD therapists thus must avoid stereotypic assumptions and become both a host and guest in the client\u2019s psychic world in order to ensure that assessment and treatment are genuinely collaborative and sensitive to each client\u2019s ethnocultural traditions, expectations, goals, and preferences (Parson, 1997, Stuart, 2004). At times, it is helpful to involve other members of the family or culture in assisting with the treatment. Religious beliefs and spirituality are other dimensions of culture that have not yet been given sufficient focus in most psychotherapy but must also be assessed and understood by the therapist (Walker, Courtois, & Aten, 2014).",

            "text": "Girls and women also may be systematically subjected to extreme forms of psychological and physical trauma as a result of their gender being equated with second-class citizenship and social norms that permit or even encourage exploitation. Sexual exploitation of women and girls is an international epidemic, including abuse and molestation, harassment, rape and punishment of rape victims, forced marriage, genital mutilation, and sex trafficking or slavery (Box 11.2\n). Physical abuse or assault of women and girls is tolerated\u2014and in some cases actually prescribed as a form of social control\u2014in both mainstream cultures and subcultures that span the globe and include most religions and developed as well as developing or preindustrial societies.Box 11.2\u201cMaking the Harm Visible\u201d: Sexual Exploitation of Women and GirlsWomen from every world region report that the sexual exploitation of women and girls is increasing. All over the world, brothels and prostitution rings exist underground on a small scale, and on an increasingly larger scale, entire sections of cities are informally zoned into brothels, bars, and clubs that house, and often enslave, women for the purposes of prostitution. The magnitude and violence of these practices of sexual exploitation constitute an international human rights crisis of contemporary slavery. In Prostitution: A Form of Modern Slavery, Dorchen Leidholdt, the coexecutive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, examines the definitions of slavery and shows how prostitution, and related forms of sexual exploitation, fit into defined forms of slavery.In some parts of the world, such as the Philippines, prostitution is illegal but well entrenched from providing \u201crecreational services\u201d to military personnel. In \u201cBlazing Trails, Confronting Challenges: The Sexual Exploitation of Women and Girls in the Philippines,\u201d Aida F. Santos describes the harmful conditions for women and girls in prostitution in the Philippines, with problems related to health, violence, the legal system, and services. In other regions, such as northern Norway, organized prostitution is a more recent problem, stemming from the economic crisis in Russia. In \u201cRussian Women in Norway,\u201d Asta Beate H\u00e5land describes how an entire community is being transformed by the trafficking of women for prostitution from Russia to campgrounds and villages across the border in Norway.Political changes combined with economic crises have devastated entire world regions, increasing the supply of vulnerable women willing to risk their lives to earn money for themselves and their families. Aurora Javate de Dios, president of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, discusses the impact of the Southeast Asian economic crisis on women\u2019s lives in \u201cConfronting Trafficking, Prostitution and Sexual Exploitation: The Struggle for Survival and Dignity.\u201d Economic globalization controlled by a handful of multinational corporations located in a few industrialized countries continues to shift wealth from poorer to richer countries. In her paper \u201cGlobalization, Human Rights and Sexual Exploitation,\u201d Aida F. Santos shows us the connection between global economics and the commodification and sexual exploitation of women and girls, especially in the Philippines. Structural adjustment programs implemented by international financial institutions impose loan repayment plans on poor countries, which sacrifice social and educational programs in order to service their debt to rich nations and banks. Fatoumata Sire Diakite points to structural adjustment programs as one of the factors contributing to poverty and sexual exploitation in her paper \u201cProstitution in Mali.\u201d Zoraida Ramirez Rodriguez writes in \u201cReport on Latin America\u201d that the foreign debt and policies of the International Monetary Fund are primary factors in creating poverty for women and children. These forces leave women with few options, increasing the supply of women vulnerable to recruitment into bride trafficking and the prostitution industry.Social problems such as sexual and physical abuse within families force girls and women to leave in search of safety and a better life, but often they find more exploitation and violence. Physical and sexual abuse of girls and women in their families and by intimate partners destroys girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sense of self and resiliency, making them easy targets for pimps and traffickers who prey on those who have few options left to them. These factors are evident in many of the papers from all world regions in this volume, such as Jill Leighton and Katherine DePasquale\u2019s, \u201cA Commitment to Living,\u201d and Martha Daguno\u2019s, \u201cSupport Groups for Survivors of the Prostitution Industry in Manila.\u201dGovernment policies and practices also fuel the demand for prostitution, as they legalize prostitution or refuse to enforce laws against pimps, traffickers, and male buyers. In Making the Harm Visible, we see how countries with governmental structures and ideological foundations as different as the Netherlands and Iran, both promote and legalize sexual violence and exploitation of girls and women. In \u201cLegalizing Pimping, Dutch Style,\u201d Marie-Victoire Louis exposes the liberal laws and policies that legalize prostitution and tolerate brothels in the Netherlands. At the other extreme, religious fundamentalists in Iran have legalized the sexual exploitation of girls and women in child and temporary marriages and the sexual torture of women in prison. Sarvnaz Chitsaz and Soona Samsami document this harm and violation of human rights in \u201cIranian Women and Girls: Victims of Exploitation and Violence.\u201dGlobal media and communication tools, such as the Internet, make access to pornography, catalogs of mail-order brides, advertisements for prostitution tours, and information on where and how to buy women and girls in prostitution widely available. This open advertisement normalizes and increases the demand by men for women and girls to use in these different forms of exploitation. Donna M. Hughes describes her findings on how the Internet is being used to promote the sexual exploitation of women and children in \u201cThe Internet and the Global Prostitution Industry.\u201d In this milieu, women and girls become commodities\u2014bought and sold locally and trafficked from one part of the world to another.How do we make the harm of sexual exploitation visible? In a world where sexual exploitation is increasingly normalized and industrialized, what is needed to make people see the harm and act to stop it? The women in Making the Harm Visible recommend four ways to make the harm of sexual exploitation visible: listen to the experiences of survivors, expose the ideological constructions that hide the harm, expose the agents that profit from the sexual exploitation of women and children, and document harm and conduct research that reveals the harm and offers findings that can be used for policy initiatives.Reprinted with permission from the Introduction to Making the Harm Visible, Edited by D.

The finding that girls and women are more often subjected to sexual and intrafamilial traumatic stressors, while boys and men more often experience physical, accidental, combat, and assaultive traumatic stressors is consistent with stereotypic sex roles that are found in many (but not all) cultures that assign females to the role of subservient helper and caregiver, while males are assigned to the role of leader and warrior. There are biological foundations for these differences\u2014such as due to distinct levels of the sex-linked hormones estrogen and testosterone, and brain chemicals that differentially affect females and males (oxytocin and vasopressin; see Chapter 5). However, biology need not dictate a person\u2019s or a group\u2019s destiny, so it is inaccurate to assume that males or females must always fill these sex role stereotypes, particularly when there are severe adverse consequences, such as the epidemics of abuse of girls and women and of boys and men killed as violent combatants or as the \u201cspoils of war.\u201d",

Studies with adults and children of both genders who have sustained TBI demonstrate that they are as likely to develop PTSD as persons in equally severe accidents or assaults who have not (McMillan, Williams, & Bryant, 2003). Fewer studies have been conducted with persons with severe than mild TBI, but they have not been found to be less likely to develop PTSD, as was originally hypothesized\u2014due to not being able to experience or later recall the psychologically traumatic aspects of the injury as vividly as a person who does not lose consciousness or have amnesia. A subsequent study confirmed that adults with TBI were less likely to report acute traumatic stress symptoms immediately after the injury and to recall having felt helpless when interviewed several weeks later but that 3 months after the accident, they were equally likely to report PTSD symptoms as injury survivors with no TBI (Jones, Harvey, & Brewin, 2005).

She presented [for medical evaluation] in early childhood with behavioral problems of aggression. She settled in a residential school from age 12 to 13 before an act of arson. She later revealed that she had experienced inappropriate sexual behaviors with peers at school. She complained of intrusive thoughts and images, along with depressive symptoms. At times she shows sexually inappropriate behavior and self-harm.\u201d\u201cA 40-year-old man with a moderate learning disability who had been sexually assaulted by a care[giver] presented [for medical evaluation] in [an] acute state with disturbance of appetite, sleep, loss of skills, and emotional numbness, but the abuse was revealed only months later. On being exposed to the perpetrator at a later date, he showed a deterioration in mental state with acute symptoms of anxiety, and later developed a depressive disorder requiring medication. His level of functioning never returned to that prior to the traumatic event.\u201dA third case illustrates the therapeutic gains that a PTSD perspective can provide:A 32-year-old woman with learning disabilities and pervasive developmental disorder had been diagnosed at age 11 with schizophrenia and subsequently had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. For 20 years after the first psychiatric diagnosis and hospitalization, she had been psychiatrically hospitalized more than 50 times due to episodes of acute suicidality complicated by auditory command hallucinations (i.e., she believed she was hearing voices telling her to kill herself) and compulsive self-harm behavior (she used sharp objects to cut virtually every area on both arms and legs). Treatment included high doses of antipsychotic, antiseizure, antidepressant, and antianxiety medications and two courses of electroconvulsive therapy, with periods of relative stabilization sufficient for her to live in an assisted living residential home and on two occasions to live in an independent apartment with in-home daily case management and nursing care. Each period of improvement was relatively brief, lasting no longer than 3\u20136 months, at which time she experienced severe worsening in the apparently psychotic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, requiring multiple rehospitalizations and progressive loss of social and cognitive abilities. For several years, family therapy was conducted, and the patient\u2019s history of traumatic stressors was assessed gradually in order not to lead to further destabilization. In addition to potential episodes of sexual assault as an adolescent and young adult, her mother disclosed that her biological father had been severely domestically violent during the patient\u2019s first 2 years of life, until the mother ended that relationship. When PTSD was confirmed and accepted by the treatment team and the patient and her family as the primary diagnosis, the patient felt that she finally understood why she was experiencing the cyclic surges in distress and was able to utilize affect regulation skills (taught using Dialectic Behavior Therapy and Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy; see Chapter 7). Over the next year, her medications were carefully reduced to the lower therapeutic range for attentional problems and anxiety, with a sustained improvement in mood and social and cognitive functioning such that she was able to successfully work as a skilled volunteer in an assisted living center for older adults.",

Morrell-Bellai, Goering, and Boydell (2000) identify poverty as a core risk factor for homelessness, because the socioeconomic benefits provided by a diminishing societal safety net and the typically insufficient employment wages provided by marginal jobs force people to rely on an increasingly limited pool of subsidized housing or to become homeless. Associated risk factors include a lack of education, lack of work skill, physical or mental disability, substance abuse problem, minority status, sole support parent status, or the absence of an economically viable support system (Fischer and Breakey, 1991, Morrell-Bellai et al., 2000). Snow and Anderson (1993) found that the most common reasons for homelessness reported in a survey of men and women living \u201con the street\u201d were family-related problems such as marital breakup; family caregivers becoming unwilling or unable to care for a mentally ill or substance-abusing family member; escape from a dysfunctional and/or abusive family; or not having a family to turn to for support.",

In addition, Ford and Frisman (2002) found that one in three of these homeless women with children had experienced a complex variant of PTSD involving problems with dysregulated affect or impulses, dissociation, somatization, and alterations in fundamental beliefs about self, relationships, and the future (i.e., \u201ccomplex PTSD\u201d or \u201cdisorders of extreme stress\u201d; Ford, 1999).

Extremely poor women, whether homeless or not, have elevated rates of lifetime PTSD or other mental illness, and a history of such disorders is associated with having grown up in family and community environments with violence, threat, and anger (Bassuk et al., 2001, Davies-Netzley et al., 1996). However, homelessness per se may confer additional risk: homeless mothers and their children have higher lifetime rates of violent abuse and assault than equally impoverished housed mothers (Bassuk et al., 1998). Thus, poverty puts people at risk for traumatic violence, but not having a stable residence compounds this risk and the likelihood of developing PTSD.",

            "text": "When political power is used to repress free speech and citizens\u2019 self-determination, there is an increase in the risk to members of that nation or community and its neighbors and associates of psychological trauma. Domestic violence (see Box 10.5) is a microcosm that shares much in common with large-scale political repression, because physical, psychological, and economic power is used to entrap, systematically break down, and coercively control the thoughts as well as the actions and relationships of the victim. On a larger scale, political repression involves similar psychological (and often physical as well) assaults by the people and institutions in power on the people, families, communities, and organizations that are deprived of access to political power and socioeconomic resources\u2014and therefore also on their fundamental freedoms and values. Without access to self-determination and the resources necessary to sustain independence, people are vulnerable to not just traumatic exploitation and violence but also to the traumatic loss of their intimate relationships, their families, their way of life, and their values (Box 11.4\n).Box 11.4The Lost Boys of Sudan: Complex PTSD in the Wake of Societal BreakdownIn the book What Is the What?, by Dave Eggers (2005), Valentino Achak Deng (a fictional character based upon a real person) provides an autobiography that includes his trials and tribulations in his current home in Atlanta, Georgia, after a traumatic journey of many years as a \u201clost boy\u201d fleeing from his family\u2019s home in a rural village in Southern Sudan to refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. Valentino graphically describes a relentless series of traumatic experiences that include his village becoming a war zone, the deaths of family and friends, starvation and continual threats of being killed while traveling by foot with thousands of other \u201clost\u201d children to escape Sudan, witnessing brutal acts of violence by children as well as adults (e.g., a boy beating another boy to death in a fight over food rations), and being robbed and beaten unconscious in his own home in Atlanta by a predatory African American couple.Valentino is a good example of a person who suffers from chronic and complex PTSD, yet is extremely articulate, intelligent, and resourceful. Valentino struggles with both unwanted memories and the need to keep his memories so that he ultimately can make sense of what has happened to him: What Is the What? By writing his autobiography, he did what the therapy for children or adults with PTSD is intended to do: making sense of, rather than attempting to avoid, memories and reminders of traumatic experiences as a part\u2014albeit horrible or tragic\u2014of one\u2019s complete life story (see Chapters 7 and 8Chapter 7Chapter 8).For example, in trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy, the therapist helps the child to write (or in other creative ways to depict, such as by drawing pictures; using puppets, dolls, or action figures; or using collage or music) a \u201cstory\u201d of what happened to them before, during, and after traumatic experience(s) and to share this \u201cstory\u201d with a parent who can help the child with feelings of guilt and fear so that the traumatic memory can be \u201cover\u201d in the child\u2019s mind. Because Valentino was not able to get that kind of help, his autobiography as an adult (the book) is a kind of second attempt to achieve a sense of resolution by telling his story. But we see how this is very difficult to do when current life involves new problems and dangers that interfere with achieving a sense of safety. Whether Valentino succeeds in achieving some degree of emotional resolution about what he and his loved ones have suffered is an open question. What is clear is that he never stops trying to do so.It also is apparent that Valentino\u2019s ethnic identification and heritage as an African man from the Dinka tribe is very important as a protective factor enabling him to retain a small but significant fragment of his sense of personal identity and his intimate ties to his family and community. He experiences an odyssey as a victim fleeing the scene of horrific trauma, an initially reluctant but eventually drug-induced savage combatant, and a refugee \u201cstranger in a strange land\u201d when he is able to escape to what seems like an entirely different planet in the cosmopolitan urban setting of Atlanta and the southern United States. It is the psychological trauma that he experiences on this odyssey, and the chronic stressors and societal breakdown and oppression that led him\u2014and millions of others of all ages and a multiplicity of ethnocultural groups\u2014on this journey of crisis and survival, and not his ethnicity or cultural background that is responsible for the profound symptoms of PTSD that he develops.",

Historically, genocide has occurred often when conquering nations not only dominated and subjugated other nations but sought to eradicate their core culture and its leaders and teachers and to kill off or enslave the entire population. Examples in the twentieth century include the Armenian genocide in Turkey, the Holocaust\ninflicted on Jewish people in Europe by the Nazis, the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Bosnia and Serbo-Croatia in the 1980s, and the massacres and mass starvation and epidemics perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994, in Sudan beginning in 2003, and in Somalia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe most recently. Genocide was first used as a term in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin, combining the words genos, from the Greek for \u201crace\u201d or \u201ckind,\u201d and cidere, which is Latin and can be translated as \u201ckill\u201d (Brom & Kleber, 2008). In 1948, the term was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and defined by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) as follows:[Genocide is] any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:a.Killing members of the group;b.Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;c.Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;d.Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;e.Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

For example, the physical exertion and pain involved in torture, untreated physical illnesses, insufficient sleep, starvation, exposure to extreme temperatures, and forced labor may accelerate the aging process (Brom & Kleber, 2008). Genocide also often includes separating individuals from their families and community groups. This not only deprives the survivor of crucial social support but engenders a sense of isolation, distrust, and shame and of being permanently psychologically damaged (Herman, 1992). Survivors also are faced with a choice of holding to their allegiance to their family, nation, culture, and racial identity, despite the punishment inflicted by the perpetrators, or abandoning these basic commitments and rejecting themselves and people like them. Faced with this impossible choice (as epitomized in William Styron\u2019s classic novel, Sophie\u2019s Choice), survivors often believe that they failed utterly and let down not only themselves but their family and culture no matter how resiliently they coped and the integrity of their efforts. Survivor guilt is an expression of a sense of grief, powerlessness, and failure, including questioning why they survived and others did not.",

Several treatment modalities have been developed, but little consensus exists concerning the standard of practice, and treatment effectiveness has not been scientifically validated by treatment outcome studies (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008). A key element that is widely agreed upon is to pay careful attention to not inadvertently replicating in benign ways aspects of torture in the treatment (such as by pressing a survivor to recount traumatic memories without the survivor\u2019s informed and voluntary consent; by encouraging or discouraging political, family, and social activities except as initiated by the survivor; or by behaving in authoritarian ways rather than seeking to be collaborative with the survivor). It also is best to use medical, psychiatric medication, and psychotherapy modalities to address the PTSD symptoms of impaired sleep, nightmares, hyperarousal, startle reactions, and irritability. Quiroga and Jaranson (2008) also recommend using groups for socializing and supportive activities to reestablish a sense of family and cultural values, and supporting the traditional religious and cultural beliefs of the survivor. Currently, nearly 250 torture survivor treatment centers exist worldwide, 134 of them accredited by the International Rehabilitation Council of Torture Victims (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2008). Most of these centers also involve the survivors\u2019 families and communities in developing shared approaches to recovery and reparation of the harm done to all.",

            "text": "The controversy concerning the use of torture on detainees in the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d has led to deep concern on the part of not only the public at large but specifically by mental health professionals. The issue is that psychiatry and psychology professionals who are in the military or consult to the military have been involved in the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists at high-security facilities such as the military base at Guantanamo Bay and the military prison in Iraq, Abu Ghraib. As a result, guidelines for mental health professionals working in these or similar facilities in which prolonged detention and interrogation may involve practices that constitute torture have been developed by a special committee of the American Psychological Association\u2019s Division (56) on Trauma Psychology (Box 11.5\n).\nBox 11.5Excerpts from American Psychological Association Division 56 Task Force Examining Psychologists\u2019 Role in Interrogation from the Perspective of TraumaThe involvement of psychologists in national security interrogations in places like Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, CIA black sites, and other undisclosed secret prisons has become a matter of considerable controversy. The issue has not only been addressed in the popular media as evidenced by articles in venues such as the New York Times, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and Psychology Today, but it has also received widespread attention in diverse professional publications as Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, British Medical Journal, Journal of Psychiatry & Law, Psychiatric News, Military Medicine, The Chronicle of Higher Education, \u2026 and Congressional Quarterly.The APA Council of Representatives \u2026 included in its \u201cunequivocal condemnation\u201d all techniques considered torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Geneva Conventions; the Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, the McCain Amendment, the United Nations Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment an \u201cabsolute prohibition against mock executions; waterboarding or any other form of simulated drowning or suffocation; sexual humiliation; rape; cultural or religious humiliation; exploitation of fears, phobias, or psychopathology; induced hypothermia; the use of psychotropic drugs or mind-altering substances; hooding; forced nakedness; stress positions; the use of dogs to threaten or intimidate; physical assault, including slapping or shaking; exposure to extreme heat or cold; threats of harm or death; isolation; sensory deprivation and overstimulation; sleep deprivation; or the threat [of these] to an individual or to members of an individual\u2019s family. Psychologists are absolutely prohibited from knowingly planning, designing, participating in, or assisting in the use of all condemned techniques at any time and may not enlist others to employ these techniques.We have come to the conclusion that the United States\u2019 harsh interrogation-detention program is potentially trauma-inducing both in general (e.g., indefinite detention, little contact with lawyers, no contact with relatives or significant others, prolonged absence of due process, awareness that other prisoners have been tortured, lack of predictability or control regarding potential threats to survival or bodily integrity) and in terms of some of its specific components (e.g., prolonged isolation, waterboarding, humiliation, painful stress positions). In other words, these potentials for trauma extend beyond the narrow procedures that meet international definitions of torture. The evidence for risk of psychological trauma to detained enemy combatants is particularly compelling and well grounded in formal research, but there is also suggestive anecdotal and theoretical evidence of trauma induction in interrogators and the broader society. We were particularly struck by the fact that the potentially traumatic elements include not only activities designed to extract information from prisoners but also much of the detention process as it is currently conceived, beyond much oversight, or compliance with international law. Given the pervasiveness of these traumatogenic elements, it is questionable whether psychologists can function in these settings without participating in, or being adversely affected by, heightened risk for trauma. Nonetheless, as a group of psychologists with expertise in preventing traumatic stress and ameliorating debilitating posttraumatic sequelae, we believe that certain steps could \u2026 minimize the risk of psychological trauma. They are as follows:1.We believe that the risk of traumatic stress and negative posttraumatic sequelae will be reduced if psychologists adhere to both the APA Ethical Standards and subsequent refinements of APA policies pertaining to interrogation, detention, and torture. Such adherence would be more likely if the APA ethics code were revised to incorporate, as enforceable standards, the specific interrogation and torture-related policy refinements that have occurred since 2002.2.Psychologists should promote situations that maintain the risk of traumatic stress at acceptably low levels and avoid situations that heighten the risk for traumatic stress occurring. Among other things, this means that psychologists should not provide professional services in secret prisons that appear to be beyond the reach of normal standards of international law or in settings in which torture and other human rights abuses have been credibly documented to be permitted on the basis of local laws. It also suggests that psychologists should not support or participate in any detention or interrogation procedure that constitutes cruel or inhumane treatment or that otherwise has been shown to elevate risk of traumatic stress (e.g., prolonged isolation).3.If psychologists work in settings in which detention and interrogations are conducted, then they should conduct or seek an assessment of the potential traumatic features of the treatment of detainees before, during, and after interrogation. This assessment can be informal or formal, depending on whether other systems of oversight are in place. This assessment should include an examination of the social psychological factors that could elevate risk of trauma. Because not all psychologists have expertise in assessing traumatic stress risk and/or social psychological factors, the assessment should be conducted by psychologists who have this specific expertise. Such assessments could inform decisions not only by psychologists but also by others working in facilities in which detention and interrogation occur. It is recommended therefore that APA advocate for appropriate governmental authorities to appoint an independent oversight committee for each facility of this type and that the oversight committees include psychologists identified by APA as having relevant expertise.4.If psychologists work in settings in which risk of traumatic stress is found to be elevated then they should (i) formally recommend alterations that could reduce the traumatogenic potential of the detention and interrogation process (n.b. some recommendations may be aimed at policy makers rather than local authorities); (ii) conduct or seek an assessment of posttraumatic stress symptoms and associated features (e.g., depression, dissociation) in detainees, interrogators, and other directly or indirectly involved staff; (iii) recommend appropriate psychological interventions for any detainees or personnel found to be suffering from clinically significant psychological difficulties; and (iv) refuse to participate in any activities that significantly increase risk of traumatic stress. If a psychologist working in such settings does not have specific expertise required to meet some of the above recommendations, then she or he should consult with psychologist(s) who have this expertise to make the appropriate determination.5.Because some detainee abuses have been credibly linked to an absence of appropriate training and/or expertise, psychologists should advocate for, participate in designing, and/or assist with providing appropriate and comprehensive training to all personnel involved in interacting with detainees. This training should include (i) clear ethical guidelines emphasizing the prohibition of causing harm and the importance of protecting detainee rights, (ii) a research-based overview of the nature and consequences of traumatic stress and posttraumatic impairment as they relate to the interrogation and confinement process and all parties involved in layperson terms with practical implications, and (iii) detailed review of research on false confessions, in layperson terms, with practical implications for enhancing the validity and utility of information gathered in the course of interrogation and detention. Because not all psychologists have expertise in these specific matters, APA should develop standardized training materials that cover the current state of psychological knowledge and practices on these important topics, and ensure that these materials are regularly updated by qualified psychologists in consultation with experts from other fields such as law enforcement, the military, and human rights.6.Because protecting human rights reduces the risk for traumatic stress and posttraumatic impairment, psychologists should collaborate with legal, military, and other colleagues to advocate for due process for all detainees, including providing clear guidelines about finite lengths of detention prior to formal hearing or trial and enforcing the recent Supreme Court decision to reinstate habeas corpus and other international standards of human rights. Psychologists\u2019 support for these actions should not come from a blanket support for adherence to law but rather from an informed judgment that these \u2026 laws reduce the risk for harm. Psychologists should be prepared to disagree with any future international laws or US Supreme Court decisions that heighten risk for traumatic stress.7.Psychologists should support increased transparency during the detention and interrogation process. Such increased transparency could reduce the likelihood of traumatizing practices, increase the likelihood that traumatizing practices will be identified and stopped as early as possible, and protect ethical psychologists and other workers within the system from being falsely accused of acting unethically. We recognize that this recommendation raises an apparent conflict with the goal of secrecy commonly endorsed by national security organizations. We concur that full transparency is unreasonable and counterproductive. Yet, we do believe that increased transparency is a safeguard against traumatizing practices. Though the details of resolving this conflict are beyond the scope of this task force\u2019s expertise, we believe that reasonable, knowledgeable intelligence experts, in consultation with psychologists, can construct a system of oversight that will both retain credible independence from the military chain of command and guard classified information. One suggestion may be to establish a greater presence of psychological expertise within a framework of oversight protection.8.If psychologists are going to continue to be involved in interrogations, then it will be important to continue to segregate the function of interrogation consultant from that of mental health provider to reduce risk of perceived or actual betrayal by the detainee. It is unknown whether betrayal of trust due to dual roles can constitute a direct form of traumatization under these circumstances, but it is likely that betrayal in this context could exacerbate traumatic stress that occurs of other aspects of detention and interrogation (especially in light of the ways that such detention appears to disrupt attachment as outlined in the body of our report). Maintaining separate roles also may enable the psychologist to more effectively assist detainees with traumatic stress reactions by fostering a trusting therapeutic relationship.9.Psychologists should advocate for extra protections for detainees who are from vulnerable populations such as minors, ethnic minorities, or other groups that have limited access to socioeconomic or political resources or are potentially subject to societal discrimination or prejudice because such groups may be more likely to receive coercive interrogations and/or excessive force and less likely to be sympathetically viewed by the general public. For this purpose, psychologists may work within sponsor/authorizing organizations to institute developmental, gender, and culture sensitivity trainings for interrogators and should review evidence concerning the impact of different forms of traumatic stressors and differential sensitivity to the interrogation/detention setting/process on different (and particularly vulnerable) ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds. Such psychologists should, to whatever extent possible, guard against such information being used to exploit vulnerable populations and instead emphasize ways to enhance safety and psychological well-being in the interrogation process. If psychologists lack relevant expertise to meet the recommendations, \u2026 they should seek or advocate for outside expert consultation.10.Psychologists should collaborate with colleagues from a variety of professions and organizations, including the military and intelligence organizations, to conduct ethical research on several aspects of the detention and interrogation process, especially its potential for inducing trauma. Recent reviews suggest that most of the interrogation procedures used today have not received recent rigorous study (Intelligence Science Board, 2006). Furthermore, very little of the recent study has been directed toward understanding the psychological effects of interrogation on not only the detainees but also the people working within and outside the interrogation and detention system.\n",

Thus, both prior to and during the displacement, refugees often suffer psychologically traumatic experiences, including having their community or homes attacked or destroyed due to war; racially, gender-based, or ethnically targeted genocide or terrorism; institutionally orchestrated deprivation and violence; along with torture, atrocities, rape, witnessing violence, fear for their lives, hunger, lack of adequate shelter, separation from loved ones, and destruction and loss of property (Weine, 2008).",

            "text": "Estimating the number of refugees is very difficult. A minimum estimate that is probably much lower than the actual number is calculated by the United Nations based on the number of persons in resettlement camps or individually recognized by a host country. Based on this definition, there were 16 million refugees worldwide in 2007 (www.unhcr.org) (Figure 11.1\n).UNHCR\u2019s \u201cGlobal Trends 2011\u201d report details for the first time the extent of forced displacement from a string of major humanitarian crises that began in late 2010 in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and was quickly followed by others in Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and elsewhere. In all, 4.3 million people were newly displaced, with a full 800,000 of these fleeing their countries and becoming refugees. \u201c2011 saw suffering on an epic scale. For so many lives to have been thrown into turmoil over so short a space of time means enormous personal cost for all who were affected,\u201d said the UNHCR Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. \u201cWe can be grateful only that the international system for protecting such people held firm for the most part and that borders stayed open. These are testing times.\u201dWorldwide, 42.5 million people ended 2011 either as refugees (15.2 million), internally displaced (26.4 million), or in the process of seeking asylum (895,000). Despite the high number of new refugees, the overall figure was lower than the 2010 total of 43.7 million people, due mainly to the offsetting effect of large numbers of IDPs returning home: 3.2 million, the highest rate of returns of IDPs in more than a decade. Among refugees, and notwithstanding an increase in voluntary repatriation over 2010 levels, 2011 was the third lowest year for returns (532,000) in a decade.Viewed on a 10-year basis, the report shows several worrying trends. One is that forced displacement is affecting larger numbers of people globally, with the annual level exceeding 42 million people for each of the last 5 years. Another is that a person who becomes a refugee is likely to remain one for many years\u2014often stuck in a camp or living precariously in an urban location. Of the 10.4 million refugees under UNHCR\u2019s mandate, almost three-quarters (7.1 million) have been in exile for at least 5 years awaiting a solution.Overall, Afghanistan remains the biggest producer of refugees (2.7 million), followed by Iraq (1.4 million), Somalia (1.1 million), Sudan (500,000), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (491,000).Around four-fifths of the world\u2019s refugees flee to their neighboring countries, reflected in the large refugee populations seen, for example, in Pakistan (1.7 million people), Iran (886,500), Kenya (566,500), and Chad (366,500).Among industrialized countries, Germany ranks as the largest hosting country with 571,700 refugees. South Africa, meanwhile, was the largest recipient of individual asylum applications (107,000), a status it has held for the past 4 years.UNHCR\u2019s original mandate was to help refugees, but in the six decades since the agency was established in 1950, its work has grown to include helping many of the world\u2019s internally displaced people and those who are stateless (those lacking recognized citizenship and the human rights that accompany this).The Global Trends 2011 report notes that only 64 governments provided data on stateless people, meaning that UNHCR was able to record numbers for only around a quarter of the estimated 12 million stateless people worldwide.Of the 42.5 million people who were in a state of forced displacement as of the end of last year, not all fall under UNHCR\u2019s care. Some 4.8 million refugees, for example, are registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Among the 26.4 million internally displaced, 15.5 million receive UNHCR assistance and protection. Overall, UNHCR\u2019s refugee and IDP caseload of 25.9 million people grew by 700,000 people in 2011.http://www.unhcr.org/4fd9e6266.htm, accessed 4/14/15\n",

            "text": "Natural disasters of several magnitudes greater have occurred in less developed and affluent areas of the world. For example, the tsunami that struck on December 26, 2004, in the wake of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake killed an estimated 250,000 people along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean, including 130,000 Indonesians. Another half a million Indonesians were displaced from their communities. Studies of survivors of this tsunami from Indonesian areas such as Aceh and North Sumatra (Frankenberg et al., 2008), as well as from Thailand (van Griensven et al., 2006) and Sri Lanka (Hollifield et al., 2008), have demonstrated that posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression are suffered by hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of people who experienced psychological trauma due to the tsunami (Box 11.6\n).\nBox 11.6Refugee Posttraumatic Stress in the Wake of Mass Natural Disaster\nFrankenberg et al. (2008) reported a unique study of the impact of a massive natural disaster: the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck the day after Christmas 2004. Unlike most research on mental health after disasters, this study began with a survey of a representative sample of persons in the host country (Indonesia) almost 2 years before the disaster. This \u201cNational Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS)\u201d provided a registry of respondents and predisaster data on health and socioeconomic characteristics of people throughout Indonesia. The \u201cStudy of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR)\u201d attempted to recontact 39,500 persons interviewed in 585 communities by the SUSENAS.The study also was able to determine the extent of damage caused to each community by the tsunami. The researchers got data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor collected 1 year prior to the tsunami, and again immediately after the tsunami, to assess the degree to which the pretsunami ground cover visible in the first image had been replaced by bare earth in the second image. Communities with at least 20% loss of ground cover were classified as heavily damaged (15% of the 585 surveyed communities). Those with some loss of ground cover were categorized as moderately damaged (50% of all locales), and 35% with no loss of ground cover were classified as undamaged by the tsunami. Community leaders\u2019 and field observers\u2019 estimates of damage strongly correlated (r=0.84 and 0.79) with these satellite-based estimates.One in three of the survey respondents (average age 36 years old) heard the tsunami wave or people screaming. Fewer sustained injuries (3%), lost a spouse (3%), lost a parent or child (5%), or witnessed family or friends \u201cstruggle or disappear\u201d (6%), but 25% lost a family member or friend, 25% lost their home, and 15% lost their farming land, livestock, or equipment.Posttraumatic stress was assessed by asking every respondent 15 years or older to answer seven of the items from the PTSD Checklist (see Chapter 6), as follows:Since the tsunami, have you ever experienced (never, rarely, sometimes, or often) and do you now experience (no, sometimes, often):A.Repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, dreams, or experiences of THE tsunamiB.Feeling very upset when something reminded you of THE tsunamiC.Avoiding activities or situations because they reminded you of a stressful experienceD.Feeling as if your future will somehow be cut shortE.Trouble falling or staying asleepF.Feeling irritable or having angry outburstsG.Being \u201csuper-alert,\u201d watchful, or on guard\nExposure to probable traumatic stress due to hearing the wave or screams, being injured, or seeing friends or family members \u201cstruggle or disappear,\u201d doubled the severity of PCL-C scores. Consistent with this finding, compared to the sleep difficulties reported before the tsunami, after the tsunami, there was a large increase in the likelihood of sleep difficulties only in the most heavily damaged areas. PCL-C scores increased the most in the worst damaged locales, followed by the moderately damaged ones, with little change in the nondamaged communities. PCL-C scores averaged 5.77, 4.71, and 2.98 for the heavily, moderately, and undamaged areas, respectively, at the time of the interview and had been 33% higher at their peak after the tsunami (based on respondents\u2019 recollections). This is consistent with other studies that have reported persistent PTSD symptoms among the worst exposed persons but a substantial decline in PTSD symptom severity over time even among heavily exposed persons (see Chapter 2).Women reported higher PCL-C scores than men, but primarily only in the heavily damaged areas. Age was a factor in all communities: persons younger than 30 years reporting an increase after the tsunami and persons 50 years and older reporting lower PCL-C scores after the tsunami. Interestingly, respondents who had a parent alive before the tsunami had lower PCL-C scores after the tsunami, but marital status, education, and income were not related to posttsunami PCL-C scores. Property damage also correlated with posttsunami PCL-C scores.As Frankenberg et al. (2008) noted, these findings probably understate the severity and widespread nature of the harm, including posttraumatic stress, caused by a massive disaster such as this tsunami. However, the study provides the strongest evidence to date that a disaster that is not only life threatening for many but that displaces tens or hundreds of thousands of persons from their homes, families, neighbors, and way of life has the strongest adverse impact on communities that are most directly affected.Another study (van Griensven et al., 2008) conducted 8 weeks after the tsunami in six southwestern provinces of Thailand (where more than 8000 persons died or were unaccounted for and another 8500 were injured) included random samples of 371 displaced persons and 321 nondisplaced persons from the most heavily hit area and 368 persons from less damaged areas. Even though the extent of death and destruction was less in the worst-hit areas of Thailand than in Indonesia, symptoms of PTSD were reported by 12% of displaced and 7% of nondisplaced persons in the most damaged area of Thailand (and by 3% in the less damaged areas). Anxiety or depression symptoms were reported by three times as many persons, with similar proportions depending on displacement and the severity of damage to the community. Thus, this study adds to the findings of the study from Indonesia by demonstrating that displacement from home and community was a factor in PTSD and related symptoms soon after a mass natural disaster.The Thailand study also resurveyed participants from the worst-damaged area 7 months later (9 months after the tsunami) and confirmed that displaced persons continued to be more likely than nondisplaced persons to suffer from PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Consistent with other studies (Ford, Adams, & Dailey, 2007) of postdisaster recovery (including the Indonesia study), as the first anniversary of the disaster approached, about 40% of each group had recovered sufficiently to no longer report severe symptoms.Whereas the Indonesia study examined the extent of damage to participants\u2019 homes and (for most) the source of their incomes (farmland, animals, and equipment), the Thailand study inquired directly as to whether respondents had lost their source of income and found that loss of livelihood was the strongest correlate of PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Thus, the Thailand study showed that losing not only home or community but also one\u2019s ability to generate an independent income through gainful work may contribute to the development and persistence of PTSD and related anxiety and depression symptoms. The defining characteristics of becoming a refugee in the wake of disaster therefore include (i) exposure to life-threatening catastrophe; (ii) loss of or separation from family and friends, (iii) loss of home and community; and (iv) loss of one\u2019s personal or family livelihood. Each of these factors may result in acute posttraumatic distress, and the combination of several places people at risk for persistent PTSD.",

Relatively stable and affluent countries in Asia (such as Pakistan, due to Afghan refugees), the middle east (such as Lebanon and Syria, due to Palestinian refugees), and Africa (such as Kenya and South Africa), as well as most European and British Commonwealth nations and the United States, have had a large influx of refugees. The half of all refugees who are resettled in cities experience economic pressures due to poverty and low-wage work and must live in communities that are crowded, segregated economically and culturally, and often adversely affected by crime, gangs, drugs, AIDS, and troubled schools (Weine, 2008). Another half of all refugees are resettled in suburban and rural areas, which are more isolated (www.unhcr.org). In either case, refugees often face prolonged separations from family, friends, and loved ones, as well as the burden of having to find a way to subsist while saving money to bring others to their new home and to provide support to those back home who have stayed behind.",

To deliver culturally appropriate services, many programs involve traditional healers, socialization or mutual support groups, multifamily groups, and culturally based activities (Weine, 2008). Services also tend to be provided by staff who themselves are members of the refugees\u2019 ethnic community, in collaboration with traumatic stress specialists and mental health professionals. The traditional model of Western professional \u201cexpert\u201d doctor or consultant who unilaterally tells local staff or clients how best to do assessment, diagnosis, or treatment has been justly criticized as culturally insensitive and potentially harmful rather than helpful (Weine, 2008). Instead, the joint experience and expertise of the refugee client, local professional and paraprofessional alike, traditional healers, and traumatic stress professionals are taken together in a team approach that validates the client\u2019s and local helpers\u2019 cultures and traditions. This approach enhances the providers\u2019 ability to make a true cross-cultural assessment of symptoms and diagnoses, to adapt interventions to reflect different cultural beliefs and practices, and to engage not just individual clients but families and communities in recovery from PTSD. Such an approach is consistent with new theoretical views of refugee traumatic stress, which include \u201cthe concepts of cultural bereavement, cultural trauma, family consequences of refugee trauma, community trauma, and social suffering\u201d (Weine, 2008). This more culturally grounded view of refugees\u2019 experiences of traumatic stress and recovery from PTSD has led to the development of innovative therapy approaches (such as incorporating personal testimony and reconciliation into treatment) that address refugees\u2019 psychological vulnerabilities but strongly acknowledge their (and their families\u2019 and communities\u2019) hopes and strengths (Weine, 2008).",

The American Red Cross dispatched DMH providers from local and adjacent communities to provide mental health support and stress reduction assistance. National volunteers recruited from across the country arrived within a few days to augment that mission. Concurrently, ICISF-trained volunteers, some of whom were already part of military mental health systems, also arrived to provide assistance. Other agencies, such as FBOs, also organized support for victims. In Washington, the military was the gatekeeper for volunteers and worked closely with the American Red Cross to coordinate mental health support. In New York, civilian authorities collaborated with the American Red Cross. As family assistance centers were set up to aid grieving families, national DMH volunteers continued providing mental health support. Because the terrorist attacks created a crime scene, access was controlled and NGOs needed official standing to provide assistance. Incorporating lessons learned from 9/11, a similar event today would be different in several ways: all NGOs and government agencies would organize their response under the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the NRF, thus creating a more centralized, coordinated response and reducing overlapping or competing activities on the part of NVOADs. Because of ongoing coordination and outreach efforts since 9/11, a greater array of disciplines and specific types of expertise would be available through NGOs. The benefits of these efforts were seen during the responses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.\n",
