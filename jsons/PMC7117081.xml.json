The most consistent proposed mechanism of disease is that of autoimmune priming by an environmental antigen (such as a virus or bacteria) which triggers the production of myelin autoantigens that share antigenic determinates with the causative pathogen.\n5\nHistorically, this process has been divided into two phases: the priming/activation phase and the recruitment phase.\n6\nThe former phase is defined by activation and expansion of T cells with spread to the CNS. In the latter phase, production of cytokines and chemokines by activated T cells recruits additional immune cells to the CNS leading to primary injury of white matter.\n7\nAlthough more nuanced than described, for the scope of this review, the authors will focus on the clinical aspects of the disease and its interface with emerging literature on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody.\n",

Cell count with differential is helpful for evaluating pleocytosis (>5 white blood cell [WBC]/\u03bcL), and if present, with a neutrophilic or lymphocytic predominance which can be useful in discriminating most bacterial versus viral infections, respectively. In most cases of ADEM, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC counts can range from 0 to 268 WBC/\u03bcL, but are rarely reported beyond the latter range with the mean between 15 and 50 WBC/\u03bcL.\n1\n3\n7\n10\nProtein counts in the CSF are typically normal or mildly elevated (0.40\u20130.60 g/L), although the range can be broad, between 0.10 and 2.7 g/L.\n1\n3\n5\n10\nGlucose levels in the CSF are almost uniformly normal.

Over the past two decades, considerable amounts of antibody-associated limbic encephalitides have been identified, some with clinical overlap with ADEM. The most broadly described entity, anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis, can be differentiated from ADEM by features such as the presence of movement disorders, epilepsy, waxing and waning behavioral and personality changes, autonomic instability, and language disturbances. In addition, the course of this disease is more variable than that of ADEM, presenting over multiple weeks or even months. Other limbic encephalitides to consider are anti-Hu, anti-Ma2, anti-GAD, anti-AMPA, anti-GABA B, anti-GABA A, anti-mGluR5, anti-D2 receptor, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2, and anti-DPPX.\n19\nImaging in these disorders is variable but can include medial temporal lobe T2 hyperintensities, cortical ribboning, and white matter lesions. For patients presenting with status epilepticus at presentation, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin may indicate Hashimoto's encephalopathy (also known as steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis) is warranted.\n",

Clinical and neuroimaging features that may indicate a diagnosis ADEM rather than MS include are listed in\nTable 2\n. In a retrospective study of neuroimaging in pediatric patients diagnosed with ADEM and then MS, Callen et al identified three factors that predicted a higher likelihood of developing MS: \u22652 periventricular lesions, presence of black holes, and absence of diffuse bilateral lesion restricted diffusion.\n22\nAlthough less studied, neuroimaging of patients with ADEM and MOG antibodies has also been reported with important differences including more widespread distribution of lesions, increased frequency of longitudinally extensive lesions in the spine (>3 vertebral segments), and a higher likelihood of complete reversal of signal on subsequent scans in patients with MOG antibody compared with idiopathic forms of ADEM.\n20\nDistinguishing ADEM from MOG-associated ADEM and other demyelinating disorders is essential in guiding therapy and providing prognostic information to patients and families as the interventions for each disorder are increasingly nuanced.

Additionally, the potential for post-ADEM epilepsy also seems to be higher in this group, although larger scale longitudinal studies are needed.\n30\nSeveral studies are now ongoing to better define the course and treatment of monophasic and multiphasic forms of MOG antibody-associated disease.\n",
