            "text": "Inflammation assists in defense against microbial infection and in healing of injury and is often associated with tumor growth. Strict regulation of the inflammatory response is essential for normal tissue function. Inappropriate down\u2010regulation of the inflammatory response may lead to permanent tissue damage, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, progenitor cell retention in the bone marrow and leukocyte homing to lymphoid organs during physiologic or pathologic processes are strictly regulated [1, 2]. Chemokines have been identified as crucial players in the regulation of leukocyte homing and leukocyte extravasation during inflammatory processes [2]. The biologic activity of chemokines depends on their interaction with 7\u2010transmembrane\u2010spanning GPCRs and ACKRs [3, 4, 5\u20136]. In addition, chemokine availability in vivo also depends on the interaction of chemokines with specific matrix and cell\u2010associated GAGs [7, 8\u20139]. Regulation of chemokine activity occurs at multiple levels, including gene duplication, classic transcriptional and translational regulation of ligand and receptor expression, alternative splicing, and enzyme\u2010mediated post\u2010translational modification [10]. Up\u2010 and down\u2010regulation of chemokine activity is crucial during the initiation and resolution of an inflammatory response, respectively, and during the migration of progenitor or mature leukocytes between lymphoid organs or between lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues [2]. Alteration of chemokine receptor expression is a crucial mechanism in maturation and differentiation of lymphocytes and dendritic cells and consequently, in their homing to particular organs or tumors [1, 11]. At an initial stage, inflammation can be enforced by a positive regulatory mechanism via an enhanced chemokine production and synergism between chemokines to augment the local leukocyte influx rapidly. For instance, CXCL8/IL\u20108 can synergize with CC chemokines in leukocyte recruitment to enhance the inflammatory response [12, 13]. Post\u2010translational chemokine modification is more frequently, but not exclusively, observed on inflammatory chemokines [2, 14, 15\u201316]. Post\u2010translational modifications, such as NH2\u2010 and COOH\u2010terminal proteolytic processing (e.g., by MMPs or the aminopeptidase CD13 and the DPP IV/CD26) and N\u2010 or O\u2010linked glycosylation, have been detected on natural chemokines and have different consequences for their biologic activity, going from no effect to decreased or increased activity and altered receptor specificity [2, 14, 17]. For some chemokines, e.g., CXCL8, proteolytic NH2\u2010terminal cleavage results in enhanced biologic activity [18, 19, 20\u201321]. CXCL7/neutrophil\u2010activating protein\u20102 even requires NH2\u2010terminal truncation to become chemotactically active [18, 22, 23\u201324]. Moreover, proteolytic cleavage differently affects the binding and signaling capacity of some chemokines (e.g., CCL5/RANTES) through their various cognate receptors [25, 26, 27, 28\u201329]. Furthermore, a receptor antagonist can be generated by proteolytic cleavage. CCL8/MCP\u20102(6\u201376), for instance, which is the result of proteolytic processing of CCL8(1\u201376), is devoid of chemotactic activity and acts as a monocyte chemotaxis antagonist, diminishing inflammation [17]. Glycosylation has been described for the CC chemokines CCL2/MCP\u20101, CCL5, CCL11/eotaxin, and CCL14/HCC\u20101, as well as for XCL1 and CX3CL1 [15]. In addition to truncation and glycosylation, citrullination, i.e., deimination of arginine to citrulline, has been identified as a natural chemokine modification. Citrullinated CXCL8 and CXCL10/IP\u201010 were isolated from cell conditioned medium [30, 31]. The enzymes responsible for the conversion of peptidylarginine to peptidylcitrulline are peptidylarginine deiminases and play an important role in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis [32]. Whether chemokine citrullination also affects disease outcome or disease progression in such patients needs further investigation.",

CD26 was first described in 1966 as enzymatic activity hydrolyzing glycyl\u2010prolyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010naphthylamide from rat liver [35]. It is a serine type peptidase that removes dipeptides from the NH2\u2010terminal end of peptide chains if the penultimate residue is proline or alanine, but under certain conditions, other amino acids may be accepted [36, 37\u201338].",

Remarkably, many substrates activate GPCRs, although their structural characteristics are quite diverse [42]. The best studied function of CD26 is regulation of the incretin hormones that control the glucose metabolism, but hematopoiesis, immunity, and cancer biology are also influenced by CD26. Apart from its catalytic activity, CD26 interacts with several proteins, for instance, adenosine deaminase, the tyrosine phosphatase CD45, fibronectin, collagen, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and the HIV gp120 protein [36]. In addition to indirectly facilitating entry and the cytopathic effect of X4 HIV strains [43], which is most probably mediated via CD26\u2010cleaved CXCL12/SDF\u20101 with reduced receptor (CXCR4)\u2010binding capacity, CD26 is a major entry factor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus [44]. The role of CD26 within the immune system is a combination of its exopeptidase activity and its interactions with different molecules. This enables CD26 to regulate HPC/HSC homing, engraftment, and growth; to serve as a costimulatory molecule influencing T cell activity [45, 46]; and to modulate leukocyte chemotaxis and mobilization [47, 48].",

Furthermore, modulated expression of CD26 on malignant hematologic or solid tumor cells has been reported and may be of help in cytologic diagnosis [50]. As an adhesion molecule binding the extracellular matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin, CD26 might promote adhesion, migration, and metastasis of tumor cells [51]. Absence of CD26 is associated with tumor development in certain cancers (e.g., expression of CD26 is decreased during ovarian carcinoma and melanoma progression), whereas its presence is also correlated with aggressive clinical behavior in other tumor types, including T cell malignancies [52]. The multifunctional nature of CD26 can explain these seemingly contrasting effects.",

CD26 was characterized originally as a T cell subset marker, present on 10\u201360% of resting T cells [55]. Systematically lower CD26 levels were detected on CD8+ compared with CD4+ cells [55]. Expression of this membrane antigen is strongly up\u2010regulated after activation [56] and therefore, is a suitable marker for activated T cells, which when expressing high levels of CD26, constitute a subpopulation of CD45RO+ memory T cells and produce IL\u20102 in response to mitogenic or alloantigenic stimulation [38]. This unique population of CD4+ cells is the only one that responds to recall antigens, induces synthesis of IgG in B cells, and activates MHC\u2010restricted cytotoxic T cells [38]. Furthermore, CD26 may function in an alternative pathway of T cell activation [46]. Up\u2010regulation of CD26 expression on HPCs by G\u2010CSF and GM\u2010CSF may affect chemokine activity (vide infra) [54]. However, as these growth factors are substrates for CD26, this may also provide a negative\u2010feedback loop for the activity of these CSFs [39].",

Soluble CD26 activity acts as a biomarker for several pathologic conditions. For instance, the level of CD26 enzymatic activity in plasma is an independent prognostic factor for survival of colorectal cancer patients [57]. In addition, plasma CD26 activity is a predictor of the onset of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in apparently healthy Chinese [58]. Recently, CD26 has been suggested to be an adipokine, potentially linking obesity to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome [59]. For a long time, the enzyme releasing CD26 from cellular surfaces remained unknown. However, R\u00f6hrborn et al. [60] recently demonstrated that several MMPs can cleave CD26, setting free the extracellular catalytic domain. MMP9 is involved in CD26 shedding from adipocytes, and MMP1, MMP2, and MMP14 release CD26 from human vascular smooth muscle cells.",

            "text": "We can conclude that CD26 and its substrates highlighted in this review, namely chemokines, are often expressed under similar conditions (e.g., inflammation, hematopoiesis, and malignant transformation). Indeed, large numbers of CD26+ T cells have been detected in peripheral blood and/or inflamed tissues of patients with multiple sclerosis, Graves\u2019 disease, tuberculoid leprosy, and rheumatoid arthritis [45, 61]. In rheumatoid arthritis, CD26 expression is increased on T cells infiltrating the synovial cavity [62], together with enhanced levels of several chemokines [63]. Inflammatory stimuli, up\u2010regulating the expression of CD26, are also well\u2010known inducers of chemokine transcription. For instance, in differentiated adipocytes, TNF\u2010\u03b1 increases the release of CD26 [59] and the expression of 34 chemokines, including the CD26 substrates CCL5, CXCL2/GRO\u2010\u03b2, CXCL11/I\u2010TAC, and CXCL12 [64]. In fibroblasts, IFN\u2010\u03b3 alone or in the presence of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and/or IL\u20101\u03b2 induces coexpression of CD26 and its substrate chemokine CXCL10 [65]. Furthermore, mesothelial cells, lining the abdominal cavity, express basal levels of CD26, and CD26 expression/activity is up\u2010regulated by factors present in malignant ascites [66], which contain many inflammatory and constitutive chemokines that are substrates of CD26.",

            "text": "CD26 inhibitors are currently applied to inhibit the most prominent studied function of CD26, namely, its role in glucose homeostasis through proteolytic inactivation of the insulinotropic hormones (incretins), glucose\u2010dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and GLP\u20101. These peptides are released in response to food in the intestinal lumen and potentiate the production and release of insulin and glucose clearance. Cleavage by CD26 completely inactivates the incretins. Following evidence in animal models of Type 2 diabetes for the therapeutic benefit of CD26 inhibitors stabilizing the incretins in vivo, CD26 inhibitors and CD26\u2010resistant GLP\u20101 analogs are now approved therapeutics for diabetic patients. By prolonging the incretin effect, these therapeutics improve glucose tolerance. In addition, CD26 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin) improve pancreatic islet cell function in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as prolonged activation of the \u03b2\u2010cell GIPR induces proliferation and reduces apoptosis [69]. Currently, sitagliptin is also considered as add\u2010on therapy for treating patients with autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes, as inhibition of CD26 and its T cell\u2010activating properties may preserve or increase \u03b2\u2010cell mass [70]. Treatment with drugs from the incretin family is as efficient as the other known oral antidiabetic drugs, and it is safer than sulfonylurea treatment when comparing the incidence of hypoglycemic events [71]. The safety profile of CD26 inhibitors is, in fact, very good, as only few serious adverse events are reported, and their number was comparable with the placebo group. In contrast to CD26 inhibitors, GLP\u20101 analogs have an effect on body weight (decreased food intake) and are contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe renal failure. In addition, in diabetic patients who also suffer from coronary heart disease, it was claimed initially that treatment with sitagliptin improved their heart function and coronary artery perfusion. However, recently, completed, larger\u2010scale studies failed to demonstrate that CD26 inhibitors lowered the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events over several years of use in individuals with Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease [67]. The fact that CD26 inhibitors might act cardioprotective is not surprising because of the large spectrum of peptides (including several cardioprotective peptides) metabolized by CD26, indicating that CD26 inhibitors are multitarget drugs having multiple effects. The effect of CD26 inhibitors has also been evaluated in other pathologies in which CD26 is considered important. For instance, the CD26 inhibitor sitagliptin had a protective effect in a rat model of induced colon carcinogenesis, reducing the number of precancerous lesions in the sitagliptin\u2010treated animals [72]. Analogously, sitagliptin treatment was shown to reduce melanoma growth in mice as a result of delayed chemokine processing (vide infra) [73]. The latter study explores the possibility of therapeutic intervention blocking chemokine processing by CD26. Indeed, chemokines are very good substrates (rapidly cleaved) by CD26, as is discussed below.",

Several cytokines and chemokines are characterized by the presence of such an NH2\u2010terminal XP motif. Although most cytokines were reportedly not cleaved by CD26 [74], recently, IL\u20103 and hematopoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin, G\u2010CSF, and GM\u2010CSF, were identified to be sensitive to CD26 truncation [39]. However, a number of chemokines were discovered previously as the first CD26 substrates with immune functions (\nFig. 1\n). The difference in susceptibility to CD26 cleavage between cytokines and chemokines is probably partially based on the difference in size of these proteins; cytokines are, in general, larger proteins compared with chemokines. In addition, chemokines have an NH2 terminus, which is flexible in structure and therefore more easily fits in the active site of proteases, including CD26. In the late 1990s, CCL5, CXCL10, and CCL11 were the first chemokines described as CD26 substrates [26, 27]. Over the years, CXCL6/GCP\u20102, CXCL12\u03b1/SDF\u20101\u03b1 and CXCL12\u03b2/SDF\u20101\u03b2, CCL22/MDC, CCL3L1/LD78\u03b2, CXCL9/Mig, and CXCL11 followed [27, 77, 78, 81, 82, 85, 95, 98]. More recently, CXCL2 and post\u2010translationally processed and activated CCL14(9\u201374) were discovered as additional chemokines sensitive to CD26 cleavage [75, 94]. Contrasting data have been published regarding the susceptibility of CCL4/MIP\u20101\u03b2 to cleavage by CD26 [85, 88]. The dissimilar susceptibility published might be a result of the different chemokine concentrations used for incubation. Oligomerization, at higher concentrations [85], might limit CD26 cleavage and therefore, mask potential cleavage of CCL4 by CD26. Further in\u2010depth investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

Resistance of the MCPs is a result of the presence of a pyroglutamic acid at the NH2 terminus, which is the result of post\u2010translational conversion of the glutamine residue and renders these chemokines fully active [99]. Recombinant CCL8 with an NH2\u2010terminal Gln, instead of the pyroglutamic acid present in natural CCL8, was indeed cleaved by CD26 [26, 99].

The removal of these proline residues may render proteins susceptible to aminopeptidases and thus, more prone to degradation during an inflammatory response. For example, intact CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL14(9\u201374) are resistant to cleavage by aminopeptidase N/CD13 as a result of the presence of a proline residue on the penultimate position. Upon cleavage by CD26 and the removal of this proline residue, these chemokines become efficient substrates for CD13 (unpublished results in \nFig. 2A\n) [80, 93].",

            "text": "For most chemokines, CD26 cleavage leads to reduced chemokine activity and occasionally, to the generation of a receptor antagonist. Proteolytic cleavage of CXCL12\u03b1 by CD26 results in reduced binding affinity for CXCR4 and the loss of its calcium\u2010dependent signaling and chemotactic properties for peripheral blood lymphocytes [81, 82\u201383, 104]. These data may explain why CD26+ peripheral blood lymphocytes are less efficiently attracted by CXCL12\u03b1 than CD26\u2212 peripheral blood lymphocytes [82]. Analogously, CD26 inhibition on T cells has been reported to prolong protein kinase B and ERK\u20102 signaling via CXCR4 upon stimulation with CXCL12 [105]. In parallel, CD26\u2010truncated CXCL12 also loses its chemotactic effect on CXCR4\u2010expressing HPC/HSCs and thus, its capacity to function as a retention signal in the bone marrow [84, 106, 107]. Moreover, truncated CXCL12 blocks the response of HPCs to intact CXCL12. Accordingly, chemotaxis of HPCs to CXCL12 is enhanced when pretreating HPCs with a CD26 inhibitor or when using CD26\u2212/\u2212 mouse bone marrow cells [48, 84]. In addition, removal of the NH2\u2010terminal Lys\u2010Pro dipeptide clearly lowers the heparin\u2010binding affinity of CXCL12\u03b1 [108]. Analogously, CD26\u2010mediated truncation of CCL11 results in a 30\u2010fold reduced chemotactic potency on eosinophils [90]. However, CCR3 binding is only 6\u2010fold diminished. As a result, CCL11(3\u201374) is able to desensitize and partially antagonize CCL11\u2010induced chemotaxis [90]. Both NH2\u2010terminally truncated isoforms of CCL22 generated by CD26 show reduced lymphocyte chemotaxis, which is explained by reduced CCR4 binding and signaling. In contrast, monocyte binding and chemotaxis remain unaffected, indicating the possible involvement of another receptor, apart from CCR4, in these processes [95, 96]. Biologic inactivation, as a result of CD26 cleavage, is observed for the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 [77, 78]. Truncated CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are unable to induce chemotaxis of CXCR3A\u2010transfected cells at concentrations 30\u2010fold higher than the minimal effective concentration of their intact counterparts. CXCL10 and CXCL11 retain weak CXCR3\u2010binding properties and partially antagonize chemotaxis induced by their intact counterparts. Surprisingly, CXCL9\u2010 and CXCL10\u2010mediated angiostatic activity remains unchanged after processing by CD26 [77]. Nevertheless, upon further truncation by CD13, the angiostatic activity of CXCL11 is impaired as well [80]. CCL14, a CC chemokine that is constitutively expressed by a variety of tissue cells and abundantly present in plasma, depends on proteolytic processing for its activity. Processing into CCL14(9\u201374) by plasmin or urokinase plasminogen activator is necessary for CCL14 to become an agonist for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (with a specific activity comparable to that of CCL5 and CCL3/LD78\u03b1) [109, 110]. However, further cleavage by CD26 (possibly in combination with CD13) generates an inactive variant [93, 94]. Therefore, a subtle equilibrium between these enzymes determines the fate of CCL14.",

CCL5 is the first identified CD26\u2010processed chemokine that has been studied in detail [25, 26\u201327, 29]. The activity of CCL5(3\u201368) is down\u2010regulated regarding signaling assays and chemotaxis tests on monocytes and eosinophils. CCL5(3\u201368) even acts as an antagonist in in vitro monocyte chemotaxis assays. In contrast, its lymphocyte chemotactic activity remains unaffected [25, 27, 29, 89]. These apparently contradictory results for CCL5(3\u201368) are explained by a loss of CCR1 (expressed on monocytes)\u2010 and CCR3\u2010binding and \u2010signaling potency but an even moderately increased interaction of CCL5(3\u201368) with CCR5 functionally expressed on lymphocytes [28, 29]. Thus, CD26 appears to modulate CCL5 to a T cell\u2010specific chemoattractant. Changed receptor selectivity is also observed for CCL3L1, the nonallelic variant of CCL3. The latter only differs from CCL3 in 3 aa, among which, the Pro\u20102 residue making CCL3L1, in contrast to CCL3, a substrate for CD26 [85]. Cleavage by CD26 enhances the binding and signaling of CCL3L1 to CCR1 (strongly) and CCR5 (moderately) [85, 86]. In accordance, CCL3L1(3\u201370) acts as an extremely potent monocyte (CCR1) and lymphocyte (CCR5) chemoattractant. Truncation has the opposite effect on binding and signaling via CCR3, the third receptor recognized by CCL3L1 [86]. As a result of impaired binding and signaling of CCL3L1(3\u201370) to CCR3, eosinophils with undetectable expression of CCR1 only migrate in response to intact and not to truncated CCL3L1. If eosinophils show high expression of CCR1, which is the case for \u223c20% of the donors [111], however, the reduced signaling of truncated CCL3L1 through CCR3 is over\u2010ruled by the enhanced response of CCR1 to CCL3L1, making CCL3L1 and truncated CCL3L1 equal stimulators of CCR1+ eosinophil chemotaxis. The closely related chemokine CCL4 retains its CCR5\u2010dependent activity upon CD26 cleavage [87]. Moreover and in contrast to full\u2010length CCL4, it becomes active on CCR1 and CCR2 [87].",

Indeed, the activity of the only neutrophil chemoattractant being cleaved by CD26, i.e., CXCL6, remains unaffected. In contrast, eosinophil migration mediated through CCR3 will be reduced in the presence of high concentrations of CD26, as the activity of the 3 eosinophil\u2010attracting chemokines CCL5, CCL3L1, and CCL11 is strongly decreased upon CD26\u2010mediated cleavage. However, in case eosinophils show high expression of CCR1, the reduced signaling of truncated CCL3L1, CCL5, or CCL11 through CCR3 might be counteracted by the response of CCR1 to truncated CCL3L1. The effect of CD26 on the migration of monocytes and lymphocytes will depend on the monocyte/lymphocyte subtype (the specific chemokine receptor spectrum expressed) and the chemokine involved. CCR5\u2010mediated migration of Th1 lymphocytes will be increased (CCL5, CCL4, CCL3L1), whereas CXCR3\u2010dependent migration of these cells will be decreased (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11).

CCL5(3\u201368) becomes even a CCR5\u2010specific ligand, explaining its enhanced anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity [27, 28]. Interestingly, HIV\u20101 experiments, with cell lines that express different levels of CD26 on their membrane, have shown an inverse correlation between the IC50 values of intact CCL5 and the expression of CD26 on the cell line to be infected [28]. These data suggest that intact CCL5 has very poor antiviral activity but may be rapidly converted into the more potent antiviral isoform CCL5(3\u201368) upon truncation by soluble or membrane\u2010bound CD26 [28]. In addition, intact CCL4 behaves as a rather specific CCR5 agonist. However, processing of CCL4 by CD26 generates a CCR1 and CCR2 ligand with retained CCR5 interaction and anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity [87]. A third CD26\u2010susceptible CCR5 ligand is CCL3L1. Although it only differs in 3 aa from its nonallelic variant CCL3, CCL3L1 is a much more potent inhibitor of infection with R5\u2010tropic HIV strains [125, 126]. The importance of CCL3L1 in the protection against HIV infection is illustrated by the association of low copy numbers of the CCL3L1 gene with an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection and progressing rapidly to AIDS [127, 128].

            "text": "Through the modification of chemokines, CD26 activity was shown to influence disease progression and therapeutical efficacy. CXCL10(3\u201377) was found in plasma of HCV patients and correlates with the development of chronic HCV infection and pegylated IFN\u2010\u03b12/ribavirin treatment failure. The measurement of the concentration of CXCL10 in the plasma of chronic HCV patients using ELISAs specifically discriminating between CXCL10(1\u201377) and CXCL10(3\u201377) showed that the dominant form of circulating CXCL10 in these patients is the truncated, antagonistic isoform CXCL10(3\u201377) [132]. Furthermore, the concentrations of antagonistic CXCL10(3\u201377) and CD26 activity are significantly higher in patients who do not respond to therapy with pegylated IFN\u2010\u03b12/ribavirin. CD26\u2010mediated cleavage of CXCL10 is suggested to result in perturbed lymphocyte trafficking to the liver in chronic HCV patients [133]. Later on, follow\u2010up of patients with acute viral HCV infection showed that those patients who develop chronic infection have higher plasma concentrations of truncated CXCL10 compared with those patients who spontaneously resolve infection. This suggests that a disturbed CXCL10 gradient inhibits the development of an efficacious innate and adaptive host immune response to HCV and favors the evolution of viral persistence [134]. Likewise, following BCG therapy for treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder carcinoma, CD26 cleavage of CXCL10 might limit the migration of CXCR3\u2010expressing NK cells and T cells and thereby, counteract the antitumor response. Elevated CXCL10 levels are detected in the urine upon treatment [135], but differential CXCL10 measurements showed that a substantial part of the CXCL10 lacked the NH2\u2010terminal dipeptide. HCV patients and patients with bladder carcinoma treated with BCG might benefit from the use of CD26 inhibitors, as these may enhance the efficacy of therapy. Barreira da Silva and colleagues [73] nicely showed how delayed tumor (B16F10 melanoma and CT26 colon carcinoma) growth in CD26\u2212/\u2212 mice can be explained by enhanced CXCR3+ lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor tissue as a result of decreased proteolytic inactivation of CXCL10. Moreover, the combination of immunotherapy (intratumoral injection of CpG, adoptive cell transfer, and checkpoint blockade) with sitagliptin treatment clearly enhances tumor rejection and the response to current therapeutical approaches. However, the beneficial role of CD26 in S\u00e9zary syndrome illustrates that the opposite can also be true [136]. The accumulation of CXCR4+ T lymphoma cells in the skin is associated with impaired CD26 expression, which is suggested to result in reduced inactivation of CXCL12 (abundantly expressed in the skin) and accelerated CXCL12\u2010mediated homing to the skin. As a result of the broad spectrum of substrates cleaved by CD26, in addition to its immune\u2010related functions as a costimulatory and adhesion molecule (vide supra) [36], the antitumoral effect of CD26 inhibition cannot be generalized. Indeed, CD26 expression in different tumor types has been associated with good as well as poor prognoses, depending on the mechanism (and CD26 substrates involved) underlying tumor development and progression [51].",

            "text": "A role for CD26 in the regulation of HPC trafficking has been ascribed to its effects on the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 axis, which is considered to be responsible for retaining HPCs in the bone marrow and for efficient bone marrow engraftment. CD26 has been shown to be involved in G\u2010CSF\u2010induced mobilization. It is expressed by a subpopulation of human cord blood CD34+ cells and negatively regulates CXCL12\u2010induced chemotaxis of these cells [54]. Expression of CD26 on CD34+CD38\u2212 cells is enhanced upon treatment with G\u2010CSF, resulting in a decreased chemotactic response to CXCL12 [54]. When CD26 is inhibited (diprotin A, a first\u2010generation CD26 inhibitor) or absent (CD26\u2212/\u2212 mice) during treatment with G\u2010CSF, mobilization of HPC in mice is reduced dramatically, providing evidence for an in vivo role for CD26 in G\u2010CSF\u2010induced mobilization of HPCs [47, 137]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that G\u2010CSF, by up\u2010regulating CD26 expression on CD34+ cells, induces the cleavage of CXCL12, resulting in inactivation of CXCL12 and a loss of its function as a retention signal for HPC. Alternative proteases, such as neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, have also been suggested to influence HPC mobilization through degradation of CXCL12 and might cooperate with CD26 [138, 139]. The constitutive HSC mobilization seen in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms has been, at least partially, ascribed to the predominance of CXCL12 truncation products [CXCL12(3,4,5,6\u201367)] within the bone marrow plasma compared with the bone marrow plasma of healthy controls, which contains significantly more intact CXCL12 [140]. Further research showed that inhibition (diprotin A) or loss of endogenous CD26 activity on donor HPCs results in increased homing efficiency and engraftment capability (a CXCR4\u2010dependent process [141]) in lethally irradiated congenic mice [48]. Interestingly, glypican\u20103, which is coexpressed with CD26 on HSC/HPCs, blocks CD26 activity and serves as an endogenous regulator of CD26, important for HSC maintenance in the bone marrow [142, 143]. Glypican\u20103\u2212/\u2212 HSC/HPCs exhibit a decreased potential to migrate to CXCL12 and to home to and reside in the bone marrow. In addition, endogenous TFPI, an important mediator in the coagulation cascade and a ligand for glypican\u20103, enhances glypican\u20103\u2010mediated inhibition of CD26 activity [142]. Thus far, glypican\u20103 and TFPI are the first endogenous CD26 inhibitors with clinical relevance described.",

Although the dosing schedule of sitagliptin needs improvement [145], this pilot study reveals that CD26 is a promising target for improving the engraftment capacity, allowing for the use of HPCs from sources containing only limited cell numbers, such as cord blood. Effects of CD26 inhibition on HPC maintenance and trafficking are believed to be linked to inhibition of CXCL12 inactivation; however, the hematopoietic growth factors GM\u2010CSF, G\u2010CSF, IL\u20103, and erythropoietin have recently been shown to be negatively regulated by CD26 truncation as well [39]. Furthermore, plenty of proteins involved in hematopoiesis with a putative CD26 truncation site await investigation and might also be involved [40, 41].",

Modification by CD26 affects the biologic activity of many chemokines. However, rather than being characterized by 1 common effect, the consequences of NH2\u2010terminal chemokine truncation are highly diverse. Either no difference or drastic alterations in chemotactic activity can be observed, the latter being mediated by changes in chemokine receptor recognition, specificity, and signaling. Besides chemokine receptors, chemokines tend to bind to and be regulated by many other molecules, such as GAGs and microbial proteins. The effect of CD26 cleavage on the affinity of a chemokine for these molecules needs further exploration. Furthermore, binding to such chemokine\u2010binding molecules might affect the chemokine's susceptibility to CD26 cleavage and therefore, might constitute an additional dimension of regulation of chemokine activity.",

Furthermore, its potential regulatory function in many physiologic and pathologic processes has been illustrated using rodents treated with CD26 inhibitors or CD26 knockout rodents. Leukocyte, HPC, or tumor cell migration is up\u2010 or down\u2010regulated in the absence of CD26, depending on the chemokines involved in the process. Although in vivo data are limited, the first in human evidence supporting an important role for CD26\u2010mediated regulation of chemokine\u2010dependent cell trafficking has been published recently. Increases in CD26 activity and in concentrations of CD26\u2010inactivated CXCL10 have been associated with reduced responsiveness to therapy in HCV patients as a result of an impaired CXCL10 gradient and hence, reduced lymphocyte trafficking. In addition, provisional data showed that treatment with sitagliptin, a CD26 inhibitor approved for treatment of patients with Type II diabetes, resulted in increased HPC homing to the bone marrow upon transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies. Therefore, the control of CD26 activity might offer a potential add\u2010on therapeutic strategy to modulate chemokine activity, thereby enhancing or decreasing immune responses in inflammation and tumorigenesis.",

(A) The consequences of CD26\u2010mediated cleavage of various chemokines on their biologic activity based on in vitro data (capacity to induce signal transduction and chemotaxis) are summarized, taking into account the specific chemokine receptor involved. The horizontal line depicts the basal activity of the intact chemokine (via the receptor indicated). Chemokines positioned above the horizontal line turn into more active isoforms (via the receptor indicated) upon cleavage, whereas for those chemokines under the horizontal line, the activity (on the receptor indicated) is reduced upon cleavage. (B) Based on studies that use mice treated with CD26 inhibitors or CD26 knockout mice, an important role for CD26 (depicted as scissors) in the regulation of CCL11\u2010, CXCL10\u2010, and CXCL12\u2010mediated leukocyte trafficking has been elucidated. Only when CD26 is inhibited or knocked out (right), intradermal (i.d.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CCL11 (a) or CXCL10 (b) results in the directional extravasation and migration (solid arrows) of CCR3+ eosinophils and CXCR3+\u2010activated T cells, respectively. In the case of physiologic CD26 concentrations (left), CCL11 and CXCL10 are cleaved and inactivated rapidly, and no directional extravasation and migration can be detected (dashed arrows). Analogously, the antitumoral [B16F10 melanoma (b)] influx of activated T cells is strongly limited, as a result of CD26\u2010dependent abrogation of the CXCL10 guidance gradient. In addition, the efficacy of the human immune response to HCV infection is highly dependent on the degree of CD26 activity in the blood. Higher CD26 activity has been associated with lower concentrations of active CXCL10 and a lower probability to resolve infection spontaneously or to respond to therapy, suggested to be a result of less efficient CXCL10\u2010mediated lymphocyte trafficking to the liver (italics indicate that evidence is based on association with CD26 activity instead of direct CD26 inhibition). Transplanted HPCs (c) show increased homing efficiency and engraftment capability when CD26 on these cells is inhibited or knocked out (right, solid arrow). (i.v., intravenous) In contrast, mobilization of HPCs from the bone marrow to the blood upon subcutaneous (s.c.) G\u2010CSF injection (d) is strongly reduced when CD26 is inhibited or knocked out (right, dashed arrow). The effect of CD26 on homing and mobilization of HPCs has, at least partially, been explained by CD26\u2010dependent inactivation of CXCL12, the chemokine that is responsible for HPC retention in and recruitment to the bone marrow.",
