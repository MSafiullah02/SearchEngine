By the end of the 1950s the Soviet Union and China were rivals, spurring the Chinese arms race. Chinese research into atomic weapons culminated in the testing of the first Chinese atomic bomb in 1964.",

The plan was not met with universal approval in the Communist Party but its implementation demonstrated Mao's authority over the fortunes of the nation. In 1956 he launched the doctrine of letting a 'hundred flowers bloom', encouraging intellectual debate. However, the new freedoms took a turn Mao did not expect and led to the questioning of the role of the party. Strict controls were reimposed and free-thinkers were sent to work in the countryside to be 're-educated'.",

Neither the resources nor trained personnel were available for this huge task. Backyard blast furnaces were set up to increase production of iron and steel. The Great Leap Forward was a disaster. It is believed that 30m. died from famine. Soviet advice against the project was ignored and a breakdown in relations with Moscow came in 1963, when Soviet assistance was withdrawn. A rapprochement with the United States was achieved in the early 1970s.",

Population estimate, Dec. 2016: 1,382,710,000. China has a fast-growing ageing population. Whereas in 1980 only 5\u00c12% of the population was aged 65 or over and by 2010 this had increased to 8\u00c12%, by 2030 it is expected to rise to 17\u00c12%. Long-term projections suggest that in 2050 as much as 27\u00c16% of the population will be 65 or older. The population is expected to peak at 1\u00c142m. around 2028 and then begin to decline to such an extent that by around 2050 it will be back to the 2011 level. China is set to lose its status as the world's most populous country to India in about 2022.",

From 1988 peasant couples were permitted a second child after four years if the first born was a girl, a measure to combat infanticide. In 1999 China started to implement a more widespread gradual relaxation of the one-child policy. In Dec. 2013 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved a resolution allowing couples to have two children if either parent was an only child. The one-child policy was formally abandoned altogether from 1 Jan. 2016.",

The official 'Modern Standard Chinese' is based on the dialect of North China. Mandarin in one form or another is spoken by 885m. people in China, or around 70% of the population of mainland China. The Wu language and its dialects has some 77m. native speakers and Cantonese 66m. Around 400m. people in China cannot speak Mandarin. The ideographic writing system of 'characters' is uniform throughout the country, and has undergone systematic simplification. In 1958 a phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) was devised to transcribe the characters, and in 1979 this was officially adopted for use in all texts in the Roman alphabet. The previous transcription scheme (Wade) is still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mainland China is administratively divided into 22 provinces, five autonomous regions (originally entirely or largely inhabited by ethnic minorities, though in some regions now outnumbered by Han immigrants) and four government-controlled municipalities.

Compared with the 2000 census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 (5\u00c174%), while the ethnic minorities increased by 7,362,627 (6\u00c192%).

China also holds the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, at more than US$3\u00c105trn. in April 2017, although they have been falling since 2014 as the central bank strives to boost the currency in the face of large capital outflows. It is among the top recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal. In 2005 China made the transition from net receiver of foreign aid to net donor and has established itself as a key player in Africa's economic development, becoming the largest export partner of sub-Saharan Africa in 2013. According to the World Bank, China's cumulative FDI stock in Africa totalled nearly US$34\u00c17bn. in 2015, up from US$14\u00c17bn. in 2011. In 2010 China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy after the USA. New sectors like e-commerce and online financial services are gaining momentum in an economy long dominated by export-oriented sectors. Rising trade tensions between the USA and China, however, pose a threat to longer-term prospects. The first steps from a centrally-planned towards a more market-oriented economy were taken by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. He opened the economy to foreign trade and investment, decentralized industrial management and allowed private sector development. In 2001 China became a member of the World Trade Organization, establishing trade relations with many countries. Private entrepreneurs and foreign investors have played an important role in developing the manufacturing sector, China's principal growth engine. Even before 1978 the economy was heavily skewed towards manufacturing, but following the market-oriented transition output increased significantly. During this period there was a structural shift away from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), although these still remain an important part of the economy. Between 1997 and 2003 the government oversaw reform of SOEs, with many poorly performing businesses privatized or liquidated. Stronger firms were restructured and often listed on the stock market. Many more recent enterprises are labour-intensive as distinct from the capitalintensive SOEs. Growth has been fuelled by low added value and labourintensive exports. However, Chinese firms are predicted to become increasingly competitive with higher added value producers, such as South Korea.",

GDP growth averaged 7\u00c19% in the second quarter of 2009, up from a two-decade low of 6\u00c11% in the first quarter of that year. FDI also recovered rapidly, averaging 4\u00c11% of GDP annually between 2009 and 2013. Growth was rooted in a stimulus package of 4trn. yuan (US$586bn. or 13% of 2008 GDP), including fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, as well as an expansionary monetary policy. Central government committed 1\u00c118trn. yuan, with the rest coming from local government, banks and SOEs. Although exports declined by around 17% in 2009, other countries fared worse and China's share of world exports increased to nearly 13\u00c16% in 2016 (up from 3% in 1999), making it the world's largest merchandise provider. GDP growth in 2010 stood at more than 10% but moderated between 2011 and 2014, reflecting the global economic slowdown and diminishing dividends from past reforms. In Aug. 2015 a devaluation of the yuan sent the Shanghai stock exchange plummeting by nearly 40%, which was swiftly followed by a surge in capital outflows. The stock market meltdown lasted until Feb. 2016, with trading halted altogether for two days in Jan. that year. Nonetheless, the Shanghai exchange subsequently began a recovery and had stabilized (at around 3,000 points) by Feb. 2017. Despite stock market turbulence, the property market, which constitutes a quarter of China's GDP and is vital to the banking sector (as it accounts for a substantial amount of its collateral), remained buoyant. GDP growth declined to 6\u00c19% in 2015 (the slowest rate in 25 years) and fell again to 6\u00c17% in 2016 as China attempted to reduce its reliance on exports, increase domestic consumption and develop its service sector.

Both supported independence although Chen Shui-bian made friendly gestures towards China and distanced himself from colleagues who wanted an immediate declaration of independence.
