Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were inoculated with SARS coronavirus for 3, 7, 24, 48, and 72 hr, respectively, and were observed under electron microscope. It was found that the SARS coronavirus entered the cells through membrane fusion instead of endocytosis, and then the nucleocapsids assembled in the RER and matured by budding into the smooth vesicles, which were derived from the Golgi apparatus. The smooth vesicles fused with the cell membrane, and the mature particles were released. A special phenomenon was that some virus-like particles appeared in the nucleus. We propose a scheme of the life cycle of SARS coronavirus and discuss the mechanism of its replication in Vero E6 cells.",

The emerging disease is highly infectious and the mortality rate is high. As of June 27, 2003, a total of 8,456 SARS cases had been reported, and 809 patients died (available at the WHO [2003] website). A new human coronavirus had been identified that met the Koch's postulates and linked etiologically to the outbreak of SARS [Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003] . The complete sequence of two strains of the SARS-associated coronavirus (HCoV Tor2 isolate and SARS-CoV) had also been described [Marra et al., 2003; Rota Paul et al., 2003] , and aspects of significance were outlined for ''the postgenomic era'' [Holmes Kathryn and Enjuanes, 2003 ]. Previously, some preliminary studies on SARSassociated coronavirus (CoV) morphology and morpho-genesis were published Zhang et al., 2003a] . In the present article, we describe further results on the life cycle of the SARS CoV in vitro by electron microscopy, and discuss the mechanism of its replication in Vero E6 cells.",

The N protein has RNA-binding site and ribosome-binding site, causing the virus RNA to bind with the ribosome and begin translation. It is of great importance for virus assembly that the N protein can recognize the genomic RNA and interact with other proteins [Nelson et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002] . Furthermore, since the N protein has a nuclear localization signal (NLS), it may enter the nucleus and arrest the cell in G 2 -M phase [Laude and Masters, 1995; Marra et al., 2003 ].

This process might be induced by the S protein [Garoff et al., 1998; Rossen et al., 2001] . In the end, the host cells are disrupted and the virions are released. It was thought that all the processes of coronavirus replication, assembly, and maturation took place in the cytoplasm [Beesley and Hitchcock, 1982; Stuart et al., 1983] ; whereas, our study indicates that virus-like particles appear in the nucleus after a long time of infection. This phenomenon had not been reported previously in coronavirus studies, suggesting that the SARS coronavirus might have some morphogenetic peculiarities. The SARS coronavirus N protein (422 amino acids) aligns well with the N proteins from other representative coronaviruses. However, a short lysine rich region (KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ) appears to be unique to SARS. This region is suggestive of a NLS [Marra et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2003] . It is possible that the SARS CoV N protein has a novel nuclear function, which could play an important role in this phenomenon. Some other RNA viruses, for example, Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 has been found to exist in the nucleus . Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these virus-like particles are SARS coronaviruses, since their appearance also resembles that of the perichromatin granules.",
