To identify the causative organisms, it is important to collect sputum and conduct washed sputum culture. Actually, however, washed sputum culture is seldom conducted in the primary care setting [1, 2]. It is considered that the clinical condition of pneumonia is essentially an infection caused by diverse pathogenic organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and various viruses in addition to pathogenic bacteria [3]. Tests that can detect these diverse organisms in the sputum of children are also seldom performed.",

TBPM-PI was shown to be effective in such cases for which hospitalization is recommended. In particular, for the four cases that had only bacterial infections, the average fever, which was 38.9\u00b0C at the start of treatment, normalized the following day, showing rapid clinical efficacy. Until now the treatment of such cases of pneumonia was generally considered to depend on hospitalization of the child to administer intravenous antimicrobials. We can treat some patients with pneumonia of moderate degree with oral cephems and high-dose penicillin. The sensitivity of oral cephems to S. pneumoniae decreased recently, and some children have difficulty in taking high-dose oral penicillin. Thus, we have the superiority of TBPM-PI for the treatment of mild to moderate pneumonia in outpatients. We should administer TBPM-PI carefully, with consideration of its cost and the development of resistant bacteria. The treatment with oral cephems or high-dose penicillin is sometimes not efficacious for pneumonia caused by some resistant organisms, such as penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. We administer TBPM-PI as a second choice of antimicrobial agents for pneumonia in children in cases in which oral cephems or high-dose penicillin is not effective. Appropriate use of carbapenem is important for preventing resistant bacteria.",
