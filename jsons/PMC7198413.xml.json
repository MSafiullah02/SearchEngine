Thirty-five species of bats are now recognized to be present in Japan (Matsue et al., 2006); the genera Pipistrellus, Myotis, Rhinolophus, Eptesicus, and Miniopterus inhabit throughout the country. Bats can serve as reservoirs for various viral zoonotic pathogens such as rabies virus in Desmodus bats in South America, Nipah virus and Hendra virus in Pteropus bats in India and Australia, and SARS coronavirus in Rhinolophus bats in China (Calisher et al., 2006). Other zoonotic bacteria, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Leptospira spp., have also been detected in Myotis bats in the Netherlands and in Artibeus, Phyllostomus, and Sturnira bats in Peru (Muhldorfer, 2013).",

Several Bartonella spp. are known to cause human diseases including cat-scratch disease (B. henselae), trench fever (B. quintana), and Carri\u00f3n's disease (B. bacilliformis). Blood-sucking ectoparasites have been shown to play an important role in the transmission of Bartonella species among their hosts: cat fleas transmit B. henselae between cats (Chomel et al., 1996) and lice transmit B. quintana between humans (Bonilla et al., 2009). There are evidences that bats also serve as a reservoir for pathogenic Bartonella species. B. mayotimonensis was first detected in the aortic valve of a patient with endocarditis in the USA (Lin et al., 2010); subsequently, it was detected in Myotis bats in Finland (Veikkolainen et al., 2014), the USA (Lilley et al., 2017), France, and Spain (Stuckey et al., 2017b). Interestingly, the citrate synthase gene (gltA) sequence of Bartonella strains from Myotis bats in Georgia is closely related to that of Bartonella DNA identified in forest workers in Poland (Urushadze et al., 2017).",

The genus Miniopterus is insectivorous and is distributed worldwide, with the exception of polar regions (IUCN, 2019). In previous studies, Bartonella bacteria have been isolated from Miniopterus bats: 49/87 (56.3%; Kosoy et al., 2013) in Kenya; 24/27 (88.9%; Urushadze et al., 2017) in Georgia; and 6/14 (49.3%; Lin et al., 2012) in Taiwan. Although we used almost similar procedure for the isolation of Bartonella as reported in the previous studies, the prevalence in Miniopterus bats in Japan found to be lower than those in Kenya, Georgia, and Taiwan. It is suggested that the prevalence of Bartonella in Japanese Miniopterus bats examined may be basically lower than other countries. With regard to other bat genera, Bartonella has been reported in 140/445 (31.4%) of Myotis bats, 10/172 (5.8%) of Pipistrellus bats, 5/53 (9.4%) of Eptesicus bats, and 47/120 (39.2%) of Rhinolophus bats (Stuckey et al., 2017a). Thus, the rate of Miniopterus individuals carrying Bartonella bacteria is relatively high compared with other insectivorous bat genera. Miniopterus form large colonies, especially in winter, and show considerable inter-individual contact (Serra-Cobo and L\u00f3pez-Roig, 2017). In the present study, we found many colonies consisted of several dozens to hundreds of individuals in the sampled tunnel. Furthermore, ectoparasitic bat flies (Nycteribia sp. and P. jenynsii) were recovered from the bats. The high colony density of Miniopterus and the presence of ectoparasitic bat flies may have contributed to the higher prevalence and horizontal transmission of Bartonella bacteria within the population.",

Here, the comparisons of the gltA and rpoB sequences between bat isolates and type strains of Bartonella species yielded similarities for both genes that were lower than the suggested cut-off values for species identification in Bartonella. In the homology analysis among representative strains, genotypes I to IV showed high sequence similarities for the gltA and rpoB, whereas genotype V showed low similarities with other genotypes. From the BLAST search, the gltA and rpoB sequences of genotypes I to IV showed the highest similarity (>99.7% for gltA and >99.2% for rpoB) with three strains from Miniopterus bats in Taiwan. However, genotype V showed low similarity (89.0%) with strain 44,544 from Myotis for the gltA and 89.1% with B. quintana FullerT for the rpoB sequence.",

Genotypes I to IV found in the present study formed a lineage with strains from Miniopterus in Taiwan, suggesting that these strains are specific to Miniopterus living in Japan and Taiwan. However, genotype V formed a monophyletic clade clearly separate from any bat-associated Bartonella strains. Thus, Japanese M. fuliginosus may harbor a unique Bartonella lineage which has not been found in any other bat species.",

The phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated sequences of five genes showed that genotypes I to IV were closely related to the isolates from Miniopterus in Taiwan, as in the phylogenetic tree for the gltA. These data suggest that Miniopterus bats in both Japan and Taiwan harbor Bartonella bacteria with high genetic similarities. However, strain bat 24-1 of genotype V formed a clearly independent clade that was separate from other bat isolates and other known Bartonella species. These results suggest that M. fuliginosus in Japan harbor two novel Bartonella species: one is similar to species found in Taiwanese Miniopterus and another is specific to Japanese bats.",

In the present study, we identified bat flies belonging to Nycteribia sp. and P. jenynsii on Miniopterus bats; these bat fly species are known as blood-sucking obligate ectoparasites. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of bat flies as transmission vectors of Bartonella bacteria among M. fuliginosus.",
