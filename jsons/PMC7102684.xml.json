Moreover, polysaccharides/glycans and lipids are constantly synthesized and metabolized by concerted effort of at least hundreds of proteins from inorganic elements and small organic molecules without a template in living organisms. Furthermore, polysaccharides are heterogeneous biomolecules containing far more structural information than that are carried by protein-, nucleic acid-, and lipid-combined.2, 3 Such paradigm is applicable to all living systems including animals, plants, fungi, and microbes.4, 5, 6, 7 Thus, polysaccharides are positioned to serve important energy, structural, and biological functions in all living organisms.",

The individual plant cell makes a cell wall enriched in cellulose, non-cellulosic polysaccharides and lignin. The non-cellulosic polysaccharides are heterogeneous.4 Spatially and temporally controlled heterogeneity in the physicochemical properties of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides is observed at the tissue and individual cell levels, which plays important role in defensing and survival of the plants. It has been found that the herb polysaccharides have important biological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, immunomodulatory, and other activities8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 with lower toxicity and side effects. Therefore, the isolation, characterization, and biological activity testing of polysaccharides in herbs have become a hot research field in China.20\n",

Most of the non-cellulosic polysaccharides are polar macromolecules that are readily soluble in water. Thus, the traditional polysaccharide extraction method is a water leaching extraction method, which is usually extracted by hot water leaching, and the polar macromolecular compound polysaccharide is dissolved in a polar solvent such as water to extract by using the principle of \u201csimilar compatibility.\u201d In addition, according to the structure and properties of polysaccharides, some auxiliary means are introduced.20 On the basis of traditional water extraction, acid\u2013base extraction method, enzymatic extraction method, microwave-assisted extraction method, ultrasonic assisted extraction method and ultrahigh-pressure extraction method have been developed.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Then the separation and purification process of the polysaccharide is generally carried out from the water extracted materials by removing the non-polysaccharide components first. Common methods for polysaccharide purification include precipitation, gel chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, macro porous resin column chromatography, ultrafiltration, and other methods alike.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Most of the polysaccharides obtained by the extraction, separation and purification techniques at this stage are still crude products because the quality of polysaccharides is difficult to control. First, the medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Second, the extraction methods used vary from lab to lab. Third, unlike DNA, RNA, and proteins, the non-template synthesized polysaccharides are never pure compounds no matter how many procedures have been used for purification. The obtained polysaccharides are always associated with either narrow or wide molecular weight ranges. The biological activities of the polysaccharides purified by the same starting materials vary as well. Therefore, special attention has to be paid during the extraction, separation and purification of herb polysaccharides.35, 36, 37, 38 The advantages and disadvantages of each method are shown in Table 1\n.",

During the past few decades, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the development of bioactive polysaccharides from the traditional Chinese Herbs. The main focus of these studies has been the purification of the polysaccharides from the traditional Chinese herbs, which are followed by monosaccharide compositional analysis, structural characterization and biological activity studies (Fig. 1 and Table 1, Table 2, Table 3\n). The polysaccharides from Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, Ophiopogon japonicus have been systematically studied by many different research groups. Both structural and biological information obtained are plentiful and accountable.",

The information reviewed here may be helpful in the definition of structure and function relationships necessary to design biological active polysaccharides with potential for the therapeutical use or to be used as ingredients in functional foods. Both advantages and disadvantages of polysaccharides as drugs rely on its complicated molecular structures, multiple biological functions, and multiple molecular targets. Thus, there is a great need for further clarifying the active ingredients in the polysaccharides and its molecular targets responsible for the observed drug effects. In addition, how to comprehend the pharmacodynamics of these polysaccharides, how to standardize the quality of polysaccharides, and how to perform reliable pharmacokinetic studies of polysaccharides also should be addressed in the near future. The relatively inexpensive polysaccharides from the traditional Chinese herbs should be useable for the development of novel therapeutic agents, functional food, or adjuvants for preventing or treating different pathological conditions as those fungal polysaccharide-based drugs approved and used in China.6, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126\n",
