Old traditional management included grazing early and late in the growing season, mowing in August and light or no fertilizing. The tree cover was the most important factor deciding the composition of vegetation. Time since abandonment was not completely correlated to tree cover, as some plots had a dense canopy and others were situated in the open. The total species number decreased with number of years since abandonment in plots > 0.001 m2and <lo0 m2. The highest species number in 1 m2 plots was recorded in the managed site, with 38 species of phanerogams. Fourtyeight % of the indicators of traditional management present in the managed site was recorded in the site which had been abandoned for 30 years. Frequencylog area curves made it possible to group species according to persistence in the sward. As a result, a group of functional indicators of rare hay meadows in the region was distinguished.",

Grasslands were once widespread in western Europe, but are now greatly reduced in extent as a result from changes in agricultural land-use practices (Keymer & Leach 1990; Willems 1990) . The grasslands may have high species numbers, up to well above 60 per m2 (Willems 1978 (Willems , 1982 Kull & Zobel 1991) . Old, traditionally managed hay meadows are rare in western Norway at present (0vstedal 1985; Lundekvam & Gauslaa 1986; Losvik 1988a Losvik , 1988b Losvik , 1993a Rosef 1996) . Earlier they were common elements of the agricultural landscape, but most of them are now either cultivated in a modern way or abandoned (Losvik 1996a ). The few old, traditionally managed hay meadows which are left, are mostly situated on phyllittic soils and have high species diversity. No investigation in the region has so far studied what happen to the species diversity and species composition when such meadows are abandoned.",

The species group indicators of traditional management was preliminary defined in Losvik (1993b) , and later (Losvik 1996b ) was shown to comprise species occurring in less than 60 YO of 548 plots (1-16 m2) of hay meadow vegetation analysed in western Norway by 6 different authors 1972-1991. These species are often low-statured, creeping, slender andor with rosettes, and mostly stresstolerators (Grime 1974 (Grime , 1979 ) and hemicryptophytes, annuals or biennials (Raunkiaer 1934) . The number of the indicators is usually low in abandoned sites (see data in Losvik 1981; Persson 1984; Austad & Skogen 1990; Borgegaard & Persson 1990) . Modern management, including medium or heavy fertilizing, also reduces species number in general (see e. g. During & Willems 1984; Willems et al. 1993) , and especially the indicators of traditional management (Losvik 1988b (Losvik , 1993a (Losvik , 1996b . As a consequence, indicators of traditional management are becoming increasingly more rare in the region. Common species are defined as being more frequent than indicators of traditional management in the agricultural landscape, tolerating medium quantities of fertilizer. These groups of species is considered to be more useful in choosing areas for hay meadow conservation, than the plain use of total number of species, as it reveals direct information on the number of target species, namely the indicators of traditional management in the sites.",

            "text": "Traditional management includes grazing by sheep for about 14 days in MayIJune and in September/October each year. Until about 50 years ago, mixed grazing by cattle and sheep was common, but later sheep alone were used. Stocking rates are about 300 sheepgrazingdaysha and year (including lambs), less in dry years. After the spring grazing period, dried leftovers of manure and twigs of trees are removed by raking. The grass is mown in August, using a small reaper and different forms of scythes. August may be rainy (Semme 1954) , but the farmers usually awaits a period of dry weather to allow drying of the grass on the ground. The grass is turned on the spot twice a day till it is dry, allowing seeds to be spread evenly thoughout the grassland. Usually no commercial fertilizers or wintermanure are applied, but some nutrients are recycled through urine and faeces during grazing, particularly when mixed grazing, involving higher grazing intensity than at present, was practised (Brelin 1979) . The main features of these management practices were common in western Norwegian out-lying hay meadows till about 1945 (Byrkjeland 1958) . As long as the whole hillside was managed, there was a scattered treelayer of pollards (mostly Fraxinus excelsior) or coppiced trees (Corylus avellana and Alnus incana). These trees and characteristic forest herbs and grasses often grew near outcrops or heaps of rocks, cleared away from the meadows, and functioned as centres of natural afforestation as management ceased. At the study site this has resulted in a mosaic-like pattern of patches with (1) a high, dense sward of grasses and herbs, lacking a tree layer, (2) a scattered field layer and a more or less closed canopy of trees, and (3) a low dense field layer in areas in the open which are situated close to small outcrops, narrow paths, ant-heaps and springs.",

This reduction has, at least partly, been compensated for by longer grazing periods. The low-lying part (about %) of site A was lightly fertilized (about 100 kg fertilized ha.year, type varied) in June from about 1950 till 1990 (in the 60ties at most 200 kg fertilizer/ha.year). The soil is rich in minerals (base saturation: 54-76 %), and poor in organic matter (C: 2.3-3.8 %), nitrogen (0.3 1-0.47 %) and phosporous (0.2-0.5 mg/100 g dry matter) with pH 5.1-5.6 (Losvik 1988a) . The site has a rather high species diversity (Losvik 1985 , 33-38 species of phanerogams/l6 m2), compared to other grasslands in south-west Norway (0vstedal 1985; Lundekvam & Gauslaa 1986; Losvik 1988a Losvik , 1988b Losvik , 1991 Losvik , 1993a Hundt & Vevle 1990 ). Species such as Cynocurus cristatus, Briza media, Trifolium dubium and Linum catharticum, which are rare in western Norwegian grasslands at present (Losvik 1996b) , are abundant in the site. An assembly of uncommon grassland species of which usually only a few are recorded from each hay meadow site in western Norway, such as Leucanthemum vulgare. Euphrasia stricta. Rhinanthus minor, Polygala vulgaris, Centaurea jacea, Pimpinella saxifraga, Carum carvi, Danthonia decumbens, Lotus corniculatus and Platanthera chlorantha, are here found together in an area of about 1 ha. The traditional management has lowered the content of N and P in the soil and resulted in high species diversity, as have also been recorded in other studies (e. g. Kowalsky 1964; van der Maarel 1971; Silvertown 1980; Zoller & Bischof 1980; Collins & Barber 1985; de Leeuw & Bakker 1986 ). At the time of the investigation, the managed site had a scattered tree layer of Fraxinus excelsior, Alnus incana, Taxus baccata and old individuals of planted Prunus domesticus. Sites B, C and D were abandoned 1985 , 1975 and 1965 . Site C was grazed by sheep the whole summer for some years after the mowing ceased. In site D light grazing might have occurred for some years after abandonment, as sheep from neighbouring parts went trough broken fences. Site B was lightly fertilized in the 1950ties.",

            "text": "The ordination results confirmed that low tree cover was important for the indicators of traditional management and the common species, while the additional species may tolerate well both abandonment and a high tree cover, even if the species may be present also in the traditionally managed hay meadows. With the assumption that the vegetation in sites B-D was about the same as in site A when they were managed, DCA indicated that open abandoned areas gradually became poorer in nutrients with time while areas with a closed tree canopy became richer (see Figs l b and lc, plots B1, D7, D9-10). Austad & Skogen (1990) recorded both rather poor Betula pendula forest and rich forest types with e. g. Ulmus glabra in abandoned meadows in a hillside in Sogn. In Losvik (1981) it is concluded that successional trends in abandoned hay meadows take different courses according to nutrient content in the soil. mown, soil analysis will be necessary to prove that the differences in vegetation resulted from differences in soil nutrients. A theory would be that litter of trees, here mainly ash (Fraxinus excelsior), decomposes more rapidly than the grass sward of the open areas, releasing more nutrients to the soil in the studied time span of abandonment. Bearing these statements in mind, an interesting interpretation of the CCA result may be that tree cover, according to the distribution of species in the diagram, seemed to be positively correlated to nutrients, while abandonment in general seemed to be negatively correlated to nutrients. In an abandoned area, tree cover, and with it the area which is in shade will increase with time. But the increase is not evenly distributed in space, as some areas are open for a considerable time span, and as such may be poorer in nutrients than areas with a tree canopy. This implies that the composition of the vegetation in an abandoned area is dependent not only on time since abandonment, but also on the local extent of the tree cover. The occurrence of seedlings of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in at least 7 out of 10 plots of 0.1 m2 in sites B -D (Fig. 5b) indicate that the open areas of these sites is really in a transitional phase, during which the content of nutrients in the soil may be lower than in areas with a closed canopy. The rate of increase in species number with increase in plot size is an appropriate measure of richness, instead of using number of species in one plot size (Kilburn 1966; van der Maarel 1988a; Leps & Stursa 1989) . But this rate ought to be constant along the curve, and as the species-area curves differed too much in shape in this study, only differences in species numbers between sites at the different plot sizes were compared. Singh et al. (1996) curves were close to linear, while in sites B-D, with a large turnover of species, the curves were exponential. The form of the curves is dependent on density of individuals and plant unit areas. In the traditionally managed hay meadow the species were mostly small with individuals of the species quite evenly distributed. The much smaller variance in plots of site A compared to site D (Fig. lc) demonstrated that in site A the vegetation was more homogenous (van der Maarel & Sykes 1993) . Wherever the analysis would have started, comparatively many species would have been added by increasing the area (Fig. 3a) . In the abandoned meadows, the plant unit area was probably larger and there was a tendency for a few species to dominate in the plots. Both invaders and persistent agricultural landscape species had a contemporary scattered presence in the plots. Thus the linear log area curves may indicate homogenous stands, while exponential specieslog area curves may indicate succession or disturbance. Continuos increase of the curve at and even above the investigated plot sizes is recorded e. g. by Hopkins (1955) and Barkman (1989) . Both tree cover and management was important in deciding the species richness in the investigated chronosequence. In a wooded meadow in Estonia Kull & Zobel (1991) also found the highest species richness where tree canopy cover was lowest (see also Pausas 1994) , and highest species richness in sites with the most regular long-term mowing as compared to cases of cessation of mowing. For semi-natural grasslands van der Maarel (1988a) argued that grazing animals and mowing imply disturbance and to some extent stress, which enable more species to coexist than on a similar area without grazing or mowing. The reasons for the high mean species richness in site A compared to the other sites may be complex (see e. g. Giller 1984 ), but the management itself undoubtedly plays a major role in providing light and gaps for all the species at the right time and place throughout the growing season. In the abandoned sites less light penetrated into the lowest part of the field layer and this resulted in exclusion of low-growing species (Kull & Zobel 1991) . The species may either disappear after a gradual reduction in population size, or there may be a collapse in the occurrence of the species. Some of the species in this study (Appendix 1, group la) may have experienced such rapid (in less than 10 years) disappearance. The species diversity decline in sites B-D in 10-20 years was 21% -57 % in plots of 0.01 m2 -10 m2 (Table 1) . However, when the whole investigated area in each site was considered, the total number of species increased in all the abandoned sites (Appendix 1, 2) . This clearly demonstrated that use of total species number is very dependent on plot size and that it may be rather useless in choosing hay meadows for conservation. High species turn-over rates during the first 50-60 years of a sere was reported e. g. by Houssard et al. (1980) . Much more rapid decline in species diversity, 70% in 10-15 years, was reported from chalk grassland by Willems (1990) . In time sites B-D will turn into deciduous woodland with a closed canopy and the indicators of traditional management and common grassland species will even- 1.7) 19(4.5) 5 O( 6.8) 3 5( 9.8) tually be lost. The fact that the mean total number of species in plots of site A was higher for areas > 0.001m2 and < 100 m2 than in the other sites, and at the same time total species number of the whole investigated area in site A was smaller than in the other sites, showed that in site A most species were represented by a large number of individuals which were quite evenly distributed over the whole area of the site. This can easily be seen from Appendix 1, as it appears that in site A 28 species are present in all 10 plots of 100 m2 each, while in sites B-D the numbers are 1, 19 and 4, respectively.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the number of indicators of traditional management was highest in site A, both when total number in investigated plots and when mean number at all investigated plot sizes were considered (Appendix 1 and 2, Fig. 3b ). The usefulness of the group indicators of traditional management as functional indicators in choosing hay meadows in the region for conservation is thus demonstrated (see also McIntyre & Lavorel 1994). Common grassland species are quite frequent in the studied abandoned sites. They thrive when biomass is no longer removed, resulting in increased nitrogen levels in the soil. The additional species occur very scattered in the whole chronosequence, and are thus generally infrequent in small plots. In larger plots the difference, mainly between site A and site D become visible. In site D more forest species have established than in the other sites. As site C had been abandoned for a longer time than site B, more forest species had established there, and at the same time more light demanding species persisted (Appendix 1,2) probably a result from the period with grazing after cessation of mowing, and thus species richness was higher there than in site B. Similar species overlap, occurring when competitive exclusion has not yet had time to drive subordinate species to extinction is advocated also by Palmer (1994) . Higher species richness in grazed areas as compared to abandoned grassland was reported by RegnCll (1980) . The groups of species used in the present study differs from guilds sensu Pianka (1983) in that no species can be a member of different groups, moreover it is no rea-son to believe that species within one group interact more intensively, mainly by competition, than species from different groups (van der Maarel 1988b). The species of group 1 differed in their ability to persist in the abandoned hay meadows. The groups la and lb comprised some of the most rare hay meadow species in western Norway at present. In abandoned hay meadows they are often recorded close to or at refuges like outcrops or heaps of stones on dry or shallow ground in the open, where the field layer is low and scattered. Some of them are annuals which are dependent on gaps in the sward for germination of their seeds. For example Pimpinella saxifraga is known to be very sensitive to increased density of the sward (Grubb 1990) . These species will presumably not be able to survive the closing up of the canopy where they grow at present, and thus they face extinction at their sites in the near future. At sites in western Norway where these species have been recorded during the last 20 years, they probably will experience a collapse extinction as indicated by the differences in the frequencyarea curves. Hay meadows which have been abandoned less than 20 years ago are getting increasingly rarer, and so are the rare species within these groups. Other species in these groups are as vulnerable to abandonment as the rare species, but are generally more common because they tolerate the low or medium quantities of fertilizers used in the westem Norwegian small scale and part time farming system. Thus a smaller group of species, tolerating neither fertilizing nor abandonment may be delimited and used as indicators in choosing hay meadows for conservation (Appendix 1, 2: *). These species occur in less than 23 % of analysed hay meadow plots in western Norway published 1972 (Losvik 1996b , while indicators of traditional management occurred in less than 58 % of the plots. Several rare hay meadow species, not recorded in the plots of this study, such as Botrychiurn lunaria, Dianthus deltoides, Galiurn verurn. Gymnadenia conopsea and Lychnis viscaria, will have to be added to complete this list of indicators of rare hay meadows.",

The groups comprised indicators of traditional management which are more common than species of groups la and lb, as a result from their tolerance of shade and/or light fertilization. Unusual long stalks, bringing them up towards the top of the field layer were observed in individuals of Potentilla erecta and Lotus corniculatus in the studied abandoned sites. Many border and forest species do in fact occur even in the traditionally managed hay meadow site. These species are usually growing close to stone heaps and below trees. They constitute a species pool and are able to expand as soon as the hay meadow is abandoned. The existence of a forest and border line species pool in managed hay meadows must be an old feature, as the whole of these landscapes were used very intensively under the old traditional management regimes, and thus the present forest species must have had refuges somewhere in the managed landscape.",
