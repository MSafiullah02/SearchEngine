Our study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Antwerp/Antwerp University Hospital (AIRPOLLUTIC trial, 17/12/162). A total of 3191 patients were mechanically ventilated within the first 48 h of admission for the duration of at least 48 h. After exclusion of patients living outside of Belgium (n = 512), removal of patients with no data on smoking status (n = 414) and elimination of children (< age 18 years) (n = 262), our final study population comprised 2003 patients (Fig. 1).",

Instead of testing associations with lagged exposures in separate models, distributed lag (nonlinear) models [DL(N)Ms] provide a flexible methodology to capture the temporal pattern of the association by entering different lags in one and the same model. The primary study outcome was the duration of ventilation in days. The association between ventilation duration and air pollution exposure was investigated by negative binomial regression, using a separate model for each of the four pollutants. Potential delayed effects of air pollution on ventilation duration up to 10 days before ICU admission (lag0 to lag10) were allowed by using DLNMs [15], with lag0 representing the day of admission, lag1 the day before admission and so on. The exposure\u2013response function was modeled using a natural cubic spline with 5 df. Seasonality and long-term trends were modeled using a natural cubic spline of time (day of the study period) with 6 df per year. Models were additionally adjusted for indicator variables for day of the week and for known determinants of duration of ventilation such as sex, age (modeled with a natural cubic spline with 3 df), BMI (kg/m2), disease severity (SAPS3), smoking status (non-smoker/active smoker), origin of the patient before ICU admission (emergency department/other) and admission diagnosis (non-respiratory/respiratory non-infectious respiratory infectious).",

In an effort to account for exposure misclassification in patients who were admitted to the hospital some days before ICU admission (e.g., 6 days at home, 4 days in the hospital, then ICU admission), we performed an analysis where we combined the daily exposure values derived at the home address with the daily exposure values derived at the hospital. Alternatively, we excluded patients coming from another hospital ICU to account for possible exposure misclassification (resulting in n = 1755). In another secondary analysis, we accounted for possible confounding due to respiratory comorbidities by excluding all patients with preexisting lung disease including COPD and asthma (resulting in n = 1672) and by excluding all patients with preexisting respiratory and neuromuscular comorbidities (n = 1463). We then further restricted the study population to patients who left the ICU alive (n = 1027) to account for early death. Finally, to differentiate between short- and long-term effects, we added annual average air pollution levels (as a proxy for long-term exposure) to our main model. Reported estimates represent the lag-specific and cumulative (lag0\u201310 days) percentage change (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) in ventilation duration for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollution exposure.

Excluding patients who had been hospitalized in another hospital ICU, days prior to admission to our ICU, also did not change our effect estimates substantially (Table 3). Restricting our analysis to patients without preexisting COPD and asthma resulted in stronger associations for all pollutants: 16.9% (95% CI 8.1\u201326.5) for BC, 11.5% (95% CI 2.4\u201321.5) for PM2.5, 11.4% (95% CI 2.5\u201321.0) for PM10, and 10.5% (95% CI 1.8\u201319.8) for NO2 even after excluding all patients with respiratory and neuromuscular comorbidities. Further restricting the study population to patients without preexisting comorbidities, leaving the ICU alive, resulted in a further increase in cumulative effect estimates for BC and NO2 and similar (although no longer significant) estimates for PM2.5 and PM10. To differentiate between short- and long-term effects, we added annual average air pollution levels (as a proxy for long-term exposure) to our main model but found it not to be associated with the duration of ventilation.",

Short-term ambient particulate air pollution is independently associated with daily all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality [19, 20]. As such, air pollution has important molecular and physiological effects on the lung, an organ frequently failing in the critically ill. A few recent studies have demonstrated some effects of air pollution on the occurrence of (only) the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated mortality. Long-term ozone and PM2.5 exposure are associated with an increased risk for ARDS among older adults in the USA [21] and in patients at risk for ARDS (e.g., trauma patient, active smoker) [22]. Rush et al. [23] described how chronic exposure to high levels of ozone and PM results in higher mortality rates in ARDS patients, and most recently, Reilly et al. [24] added long-term exposure to low to moderate levels of sulfur dioxide, NO2 and carbon monoxide to the risk factors for ARDS in trauma patients.",

Significant associations were observed for lag0, representing the day of ICU admission, but positive estimates (close to significance for BC and PM2.5) were also observed for lag1. A similar lagged pattern (lag0 and lag1) has been shown in a recent study investigating the association between the short-term effect of ambient air pollution (PM1 and PM2.5) and hospital admission for respiratory diseases [25]. The mechanism of this lagged pattern is not completely understood, but (pulmonary and/or systemic) oxidative stress and inflammation might be plausible biological mechanisms. For example, in a prospective panel study, increased blood levels of C-reactive protein and ICAM-1 were observed for an increase in PM10 and ultrafine particles with a delay of 1\u20132 days [26]. In 3996 individuals of the Framingham Heart Study, elevated exposure to relatively low levels of ambient air pollution for a few days was associated with higher levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation (including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2) [27]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that acute air pollution-induced inflammation processes occur, at least in the lung, since this is the primary site of inflammation. The effects of air pollutants on the lung originate from extracellular activation of the inflammatory response and/or oxidative stress-mediated inflammation in airway epithelial cells [28].",

Indeed, duration of ventilation-related conditions such as cognitive impairment, depression, neuro-myopathy and pulmonary function alterations (e.g., reduced diffusion capacity) can persist in the ICU survivor, resulting in a long-term need of medical, psychological and/or physiotherapeutic care, causing considerable economic burden [32, 33].

However, considering the higher age and expected preexisting health problems in our study population, we may assume that a considerable portion of time before admission was spent at the home address. Furthermore, a number of patients had been admitted to our hospital some days before ICU admission, thus generating some exposure misclassification. However, it is reasonable to assume that the exposure misclassification is random, resulting in an underestimation of effect estimates [37, 38]. Moreover, our findings stayed robust after accounting for possible exposure misclassification and excluding patients coming from another hospital ICU.
