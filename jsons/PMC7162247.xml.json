Before the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak coronavirus diversity was poorly documented, especially at the genomic level. However, coronavirus research has been invigorated since the sequencing of the first SARS\u2010CoV isolate (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003). For example, in the wake of SARS, two novel human coronaviruses were found [HKU1, GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) accession AY597011 (Woo et al., 2005); and NL63, GenBank accession NC_005831 (van der Hoek et al., 2004)]. Also notable are the release of new genomic sequences for SARS\u2010CoV among carnivores, artiodactyls, humans and Chiroptera (Guan et al., 2003; Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Tu et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2006).",

Owing to the perceived potential of the 29\u2010nucleotide region as a clue to the animal origins and subsequent adaptation of SARS\u2010CoV to human hosts, this 29\u2010nucleotide region garnered media attention as early as May 2003 as a \u201c29\u2010nucleotide deletion\u201d in human SARS\u2010CoV that enabled animal to human transmission (Bradsher and Altman, 2003; Enserink, 2003).",

The key difference between direct optimization and multiple alignment is that in direct optimization evolutionary differences in sequence length are accommodated, not by the use of gap characters, but rather by allowing insertion\u2013deletion events between ancestral and descendant sequences. In direct optimization, evolutionary base substitution and insertion\u2013deletion events are treated with the same edit costs that are used in standard studies using static alignment followed by search for a set of optimal tree(s). However, in direct optimization, alignment is dynamic in that a novel set of putative sequence homologies is considered each time a novel topology is considered. The best set(s) of homologies is discovered by searching for the topology(ies) that minimizes the global cost of substitution and indel events.",

Unlike Snijder et al. (2003) who used an equine torovirus outgroup (as the taxonomy suggests might be suitable http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/index.htm), we could not verify the suitability of an outgroup from outside the coronaviruses. Our investigation using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) [default values as implemented in GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (i.e., expect = 10)] indicated to us that no arterivirus or torovirus genome in GenBank bears significant nucleotide similarity with any coronavirus. As outgroups, we used genomes and partial genomes from non\u2010SARS coronaviruses (1, 2). We choose many candidate outgroup taxa to maximize host and antigenic diversity. Clades formed by antigenic group 1, group 2, and group 3 coronaviruses have significant branch lengths between each other and the SARS\u2010CoV clade. Finding the ingroup root when the available outgroups are markedly divergent can be challenging. The divergence can be a result of rapid mutation rates, recombination events, inadequate sampling, multiple evolutionary origins, or a combination of these phenomena. Thus we performed several experimental searches in which a random outgroup selected from non\u2010SARS taxa was used. The results of these searches were assessed to see whether our phylogenetic and host evolution results were affected by outgroup choice. To perform these randomization experiments, we output an implied alignment (Wheeler, 2003) resulting from each parameter set and best tree. (POY3 commands: \u2010phastwincladfile  $IMPLIEDALIGNMENT.phast \u2010topodiagnoseonly  \u2010topofile  $ALIGNMENTPARAMETERS.TREE). Next, for each implied alignment we used 1000 replicate new technology tree searches (TNT command: XMULT 2) (Goloboff et al., 2003b). In each search replicate, we randomly deleted a subset of the outgroup taxa and assessed: (1) whether the most basal taxon in the SARS ingroup was stable, and (2) whether the most basal taxon of the SARS ingroup was ever an isolate from an animal host (scripts available from the authors).",

Thus, the non\u2010SARS coronaviruses can serve as outgroups to SARS\u2010CoV. This can be revisited if and when data on viruses closely related to SARS\u2010CoV become available. Alternatively, other researchers used a torovirus and/or okavirus outgroup(s) to place SARS\u2010CoV as sister to group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003; Li\u00f3 and Goldman, 2004). However, based on the data in GenBank, toroviruses and okaviruses bear little sequence similarity to any coronavirus. The danger in use of such distant outgroups is well documented (Wheeler, 1990; Graham et al., 2002). In essence, distant outgroups act as if they are random sequences resulting in spurious attraction to the longest branch available among the ingroup. Indeed the branch lengths between the major clades of coronaviruses in the 83 and 157 isolate datasets of this paper are long. This problem is addressed in the 114 isolate data set. The best approach going forward is to extend sampling of diverse coronavirus genomes to search for outgroups of SARS\u2010CoV in humans, especially from Chiroptera, carnivores and non\u2010human primates.",

Before the SARS epidemic, the small number of animal coronaviruses that had been sequenced were selected primarily from animals of agricultural importance or model organisms. This lack of sampling of coronaviruses from wild animals is changing as viral surveys of Chiroptera, camelids and bovids are published and in preparation (Chu et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2007; Jina et al., 2007; Zhang, X et al., 2007).",

The concentrated changes test (CCT; Madison, 1990) whether a change in one character (e.g., insertion or deletion of the 29\u2010nucleotide region) and a change in another character (e.g., host phenotype) co\u2010occur on the same branches of a tree more often than expected by chance. In the case of the 83 isolate data set we observe a significant correlation between the presence of this 29\u2010nucleotide region and carnivore hosts. In the case of the 157 isolate data set we observe an insignificant correlation. In the case of the 114 isolate data set we do not observe changes that strictly co\u2010occur. However, we do observe that host shifts in the 114 and 157 isolate data set that host shifts occur in the region of the tree in which changes in the 29\u2010nucleotide region occurred more basally. Thus, the presence of the 29\u2010bp region may predispose or be part of a suite of genomic changes associated with host shifts. In light of these results, it is of interest to implement a relaxed concentrated changes test.

The recent outbreak lineage of H5N1 has spread from Asia to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa during the period of 1996\u20132005 and has not yet arrived in North America. In contrast, SARS\u2010CoV spread not only from Asia to Europe but also North America in a matter of months (November 2002\u2013March 2003).
