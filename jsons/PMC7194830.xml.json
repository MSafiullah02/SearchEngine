Since then, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated 1 696 588 confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including 105 952 deaths as of 12 April 2020 [1]. Due to an exponential spread in 213 countries, it was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Coronavirus is one of the major pathogens that primarily targets the human respiratory system [2]. Respiratory aerosol, droplets, and contact are considered the main routes of transmission. Currently, COVID-19 patients remain as the primary source of infection [3]. Early detection and correct diagnosis have become crucial to prevent the spread of infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to confirm the microbiological diagnosis [4]. We reported a case of a 34-year-old man, presented with sudden development of fever and breathing difficulty. Later, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 positive case by reverse-transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) assay from the COVID swab test.",

Same afternoon at 17:00, he suddenly developed fever and shortness of breath and admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. On admission vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 105/70 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats/min, body temperature 38.2 \u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation on room air 96%. Besides, the COVID swab test for RT-PCR was negative. He had no history of sore throat, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, and cough. Moreover, he did not have any history of traveling to COVID prone areas or no history of direct contact of COVID positive patients.",

He received supportive treatment. Laboratory test results did not reveal leukocytosis or leukocytopenia. Chest X-ray revealed ground-glass opacity in the right middle and lower zone of the lung. After seeing the chest X-ray, he became highly suspected of having COVID-19, and subsequently, the swab (nasal and throat) test for RT-PCR was done again in the afternoon where the result was positive. After that, he was treated with chloroquine and azithromycin, oxygen for hypoxia, and intravenous fluid for correction of low BP. After treatment with antibiotics, his fever and difficulty with breathing initially improved on 21 March. On 22 March, when fever and breathing difficulty continues to worsen, the patient was moved to the intensive care unit for better management where intubation was not needed.",

Furthermore, Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in the lungs rather than in the upper respiratory tract [7,8]. The result of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test more likely depends on the viral load of the specimen. Hence, there are chances of false negatives on occasion for oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs tests, affected by-the site from where the sample was taken, the experience of the operator, and the actual quantity of virus. In that case, the Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen test can be considered for more accuracy with a consideration of higher exposure risk. In addition to the above specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in a patient's sputum or stool swab by RT-PCR assay and blood for antibody test [9]. Combination with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test and other detective methods such as a specific antigen, IgM antibody, or the next-generation sequencing, may also conducive to diagnosis.",
