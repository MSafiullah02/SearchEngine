DNA sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of Cag7-ct383 of H. pylori 51 shared 98.4% and 97.4% identity with H. pylori 26695 and J99, respectively.

The Cag7-ct383 protein level in the L. lactis transformant reached a maximum at the early stationary phase without extracellular secretion. The oral administration of the L. lactis transformant into mice generated anti-Cag7 antibody in serum in five of five mice. These results suggest that L. lactis transformant expressing Cag7-ct383 protein may be applicable as an oral vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic immunity to H. pylori.",

            "text": "As infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes the most common gastroduodenal human diseases, antibiotic therapy is used to eradicate H. pylori infection (Crespo & Suh, 2001; Czinn, 2004) . However, current therapeutic regimens have produced unsatisfactory results due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori and a high reinfection rate after successful eradication (Zendehdel et al., 2005) . This has led to a requirement to develop a vaccination method to prevent infection by H. pylori. In this context, several cellular components of H. pylori, including the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) (Prinz et al., 2003) , adhesin (Xu et al., 2005) , urease (Lee et al., 2001) , vacuolating cytotoxin A (Liu et al., 2004) , neutrophil-activating protein (Satin et al., 2000) , catalase (Chen et al., 2003) , and Cag12 (Kim et al., 2006b) , have been selected as putative antigens for the vaccination against H. pylori. Among these putative antigens, CagA and Cag12 are known to be the protein components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) that builds a needle-like structure on the H. pylori. Significant advances in our understanding of the pathogenic role of the cag pathogenicity island (cag-PAI) in H. pylori have revealed that the type 1 H. pylori strains, which are mainly associated with several severe forms of gastric diseases, can be distinguished from type II strains by the presence of cag-PAI (Rohde et al., 2003; Backert & Selbach, 2008) . The cag-PAI consists of 32 genes and encodes the T4SS. Helicobacter pylori uses T4SS to inject the CagA protein and possibly other factors into gastric epithelial cells, in a manner similar to T4SS of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which transfers oncogenic DNA and effector proteins to host cells during infection (Tanaka et al., 2003; Llosa & O'Callaghan, 2004) . Although the protein components of H. pylori T4SS, as well as the precise mechanisms by which T4SS mediates its diverse effects on host cells, remain obscure, it has been shown by microscopic techniques that the VirB10-homologous protein HP0527 (Cag7) covers a central hollow needle region of T4SS of H. pylori as a major component of T4SS-associated needlelike structure surface filament (Rohde et al., 2003) . Helicobacter pylori Cag7 likely has the potential to be used as a vaccine antigen, in that Cag7 is localized on the surface of T4SS, which is detected in all strains of type I H. pylori in association with their pathogenicity. However, Cag7 of the T4SS has not been tested as a vaccine antigen that induces protective immunity against H. pylori.",

Although L. lactis lacks the ability to colonize in vivo, this bacterium has been shown to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal and systemic immune system via mucosal routes (Steidler et al., 2000) . Lactococcus lactis has approximately the same size as biodegradable microparticles that can be taken up by M cells in gut-associated immune tissues, thus supporting the capability of L. lactis to act as an effective oral vaccine vehicle. Furthermore, the phosphopolysaccharide produced by L. lactis is nontoxic but can function as a B-cell mitogen (Kitazawa et al., 1996) . Recently, several research groups have reported that L. lactis can be genetically engineered to express bacterial or viral antigens, including the HIV Env antigen (Xin et al., 2003) , Brucella abortus L7/L12 antigen (Ribeiro et al., 2002) , human papillomavirus Type 16 E7 antigen (Bermudez-Humaran et al., 2002) , Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein MSP3 antigen (Theisen et al., 2004) , Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae SpaA antigen (Cheun et al., 2004) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid antigen (Pei et al., 2005) , and tetanus toxin fragment C (Robinson et al., 2004) .",

The 1152 bp of the 3 0 -region (3874-5025 nt) of the cag7 (HP0527) gene of H. pylori, which encodes the C-terminal 383 amino acid (ct383 aa, 41.4 kDa) of Cag7 protein, including the VirB10-homology region (VHR, 373 aa) and an additional 10 aa of the 3 0conserved region (TCR), appeared to be highly conserved among these three strains. It was therefore expressed in the live delivery vehicle L. lactis using the Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle vector (pMG36e). Sequentially, the L. lactis transformant expressing the Cag7-ct383 protein was orally delivered into mice to examine whether it could elicit a systemic humoral immune response against Cag7 protein of H. pylori.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , the amino acid sequence of Cag7 of H. pylori 51, which was deduced from the DNA sequence of the cag7 gene of H. pylori 51, showed 82.4% and 74.6% identity with the individual amino acid sequences of H. pylori 26695 and J99 counterparts, both of which were previously published in the GenBank databases. When the amino acid sequence of Cag7 (1674 aa) of H. pylori 51 was aligned with those of H. pylori 26695 and J99, the 5 0 -repeat region and the middle repeat region showed a significant difference among these three strains. In contrast, the 5 0conserved region (FCR), the TCR, and the VHR showed a high degree of identity, with the highest degree of identity in the FCR being $98.9% between 51 and 26695, and $98.9% between 51 and J99. On the other hand, when the entire deduced amino acid sequence of Cag7 was analyzed for hydrophobicity by the method of Kyte & Doolittle (1982) , the major hydrophobic regions appeared to be located within the FCR and the VHR, and the rest of the molecule appeared to be hydrophilic (Supporting Information, Fig.  S1a and b) . It should be noted that three independent PCR products for the cag7 gene were sequenced to exclude a possible occurrence of sequence errors due to the poor fidelity of the Taq polymerase and that there were no sequence differences among three independent PCR-amplified DNA products of the cag7 gene. The DNA sequence data of cag7 gene of H. pylori 51 were submitted to the GenBank databases under the accession number FJ998174.",

Under these conditions, the majority of GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein produced in the E. coli transformant appeared to remain in a soluble form without secretion (data not shown). Subsequently, the soluble form of the GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein contained in the cell lysate of the E. coli transformant was purified using Glutathione-Sepharose 4B. As shown in Fig. 2a , the synthesis of the GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein with a molecular mass of 67.4 kDa was detected on 10% SDS-PAGE. Approximately 120 mg of GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein was obtained from 60 mL of culture fluid under the above purification conditions. To raise a rat polyclonal antibody against the Cag7 of H. pylori 51, the purified GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein (30 mg) was mixed with Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant and injected intramuscularly into the rat. To evaluate generation of the anti-Cag7 antibody by Western blot analysis, the rat was bled 7 days after quaternary immunization. The antiserum, in 10 000fold dilution, appeared to detect the GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein (67.4 kDa) in the cell lysate as well as the purified protein that was used as the antigen (Fig. 2b ). In addition, the antiserum was able to recognize specifically the individual intact Cag7 proteins ($219 kDa) derived from the three H. pylori strains (26695, J99, and 51) (Fig. 2c) . Under these conditions, the rat preimmune serum failed to recognize the GST-Cag7-ct383 or the intact Cag7 protein (data not shown). It is worth noting that the antiserum could detect a minor protein band with a molecular mass of 61 kDa. As this additional protein band was predicted to be a cleaved or truncated GST-Cag7-ct383 protein, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-GST antibody to examine this prediction. As shown in Fig. 2d , the 61-kDa protein band detected by the rat antiserum was also recognized by anti-GST antibody, confirming that it was a truncated or cleaved GST-Cag7 fusion protein. These results indicated that the rat antiserum, raised against the GST-Cag7-ct383 fusion protein, could specifically recognize the Cag7 protein. In addition, these results demonstrated that the ct383 aa of Cag7, including the VHR (373 aa), was able to stimulate a humoral immunity to generate anti-Cag7 antibody.",

Whereas the oral administration of L. lactis transformant producing Cag12 in mice resulted in the successful generation of the anti-Cag12 antibody in serum in two of five cases (Kim et al., 2006b) , the oral administration of L. lactis transformant producing HpaA in five mice failed to generate the anti-HpaA antibody in serum (Kim et al., 2006a) .

As shown in Fig. 5 , none of these recombinant proteins expressed in the L. lactis transformants was secreted extracellularly. At the same time, the amount of Cag7-ct383 protein located in the soluble fraction appeared to be fivefold higher than that located in the insoluble envelope fraction, whereas approximately half of the Cag12 protein produced in the L. lactis transformant was located in the soluble fraction. However, the HpaA protein produced in the L. lactis transformant was mostly located in the insoluble fraction, which was previously reported to consist of the insoluble portion of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane (Tai et al., 1997) .

Recently, in relation to the pathogenicity of H. pylori, the cag pathogenicity island (cag-PAI), which is $40 kb in length, has been investigated (Rohde et al., 2003; Backert & Selbach, 2008) . The 32 genes, encoding components of the T4SS that builds a needle-like structure on the H. pylori surface, are known to span the cag-PAI. The Cag7 protein encoded by the cag7 gene located in the cag-PAI is known to cover the surface of T4SS of H. pylori. In the present study, the ct383 aa region ($41.4 kDa) of H. pylori Cag7 has been selected as the putative vaccine antigen and is expressed in L. lactis, which can deliver heterologous proteins to mucosal as well as systemic immune systems via mucosal routes. The Cag7 protein used in this study is thought to fulfill the criteria that are important for a vaccine antigen, i.e. it is a cell surface molecule as a component of the T4SS by which H. pylori injects virulence factors, including the CagA protein, into gastric epithelial cells (Tanaka et al., 2003; Llosa & O'Callaghan, 2004) . Furthermore, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Cag7 of H. pylori 51 with those of H. pylori 26695 and J99 counterparts revealed that the FCR, the TCR, and the VHR of Cag-7 protein possessed a high degree of identity (495.5%) among these three strains. This highly conserved nature in the amino acid sequence of Cag7 protein among different H. pylori isolates also supports the potential of the Cag7 protein as a vaccine antigen against H. pylori. Several studies have revealed that the B-cell epitopes on native antigen proteins are predominantly composed of hydrophilic amino acids rather than hydrophobic amino acids, because protruding regions on the surface of the antigen protein are generally recognized as Fig. 5 . Cellular localization of Cag7-ct383 (a), Cag12 (b), and HpaA (c) in Lactococcus lactis transformant. After cultivation of L. lactis transformant expressing Cag7-ct383, Cag12, or HpaA for 24 h, the culture fluid was concentrated to obtain the extracellular secretion fraction, and the cells were subjected to fractionation into the soluble fraction and the envelope fraction as described in Materials and methods. After equivalent amounts of the individual fractions were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to the Immobilon-P membranes, the membranes were probed with individual antibodies. Cag7-ct383, Cag12, and HpaA protein were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system. the epitopes (Dong et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2008) . On the other hand, the immunodominant sites for helper T cells tend to be regions that can be folded as a-helices and helices that are amphipathic, possessing a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side separated in space (Berzofsky et al., 1987; Berzofsky, 1988) . These two sides may serve to interact with the major histocompatibility molecule on the antigen-presenting cell and with the T-cell receptor, respectively. As hydrophobicity analysis revealed that the ct383 aa region of H. pylori Cag7 protein had a hydrophobic part between both hydrophilic ends in its primary structure, a decision was made to choose the Cag7-ct383 aa region as the vaccination antigen.",

The vector plasmid pMG36e contains a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, the start of an ORF, and a transcriptional terminator, and is known to be a constitutive expression vector for the inserted gene in L. lactis (Van De Guchte et al., 1989) . When the expression level of the Cag7-ct383 protein in the L. lactis transformant was compared by Western blot analysis during the culture period for 120 h, the expression level of the Cag7-ct383 protein (41.4 kDa) exhibited no significant variation between the early log phase and the late log phase, with the maximum level expression occurring at the early stationary phase, thus demonstrating its constitutive expression regardless of the population growth phases. In our previous studies, the expression level of the H. pylori HpaA protein by the vector plasmid pMG36e in the L. lactis transformant remained constant irrespective of the population growth phases (Kim et al., 2006a) , whereas the expression level of the Cag12 protein appeared to vary during the growth phases in the L. lactis transformant, reaching a maximum level at the early log phase and decreasing to the basal level at the stationary phase (Kim et al., 2006b) . As the vector plasmid pMG36e is a constitutive expression vector, these previous and current results suggest that the Cag12 protein, but not HpaA and Cag7-ct383, produced in L. lactis may be unstable during the stationary phase. The oral administration of the L. lactis transformant expressing the Cag7-ct383 protein into mice generated the anti-Cag7 antibody in the serum of five of five mice, demonstrating that the systemic humoral immune response was successfully induced against the Cag7-ct383 protein delivered by L. lactis via the mucosal route. The experimental approaches including the optimal vaccination condition and protection experiment against H. pylori infection still remain to be determined.",

The Cag7-ct383 protein was detected mainly in the soluble fraction, whereas half of the Cag12 protein was located in the soluble fraction. In contrast, HpaA protein was mainly detected in the insoluble envelope fraction. As our previous studies revealed that oral administration of the L. lactis transformant producing Cag12 in mice resulted in successful induction of a humoral immune response to Cag12 in two of five cases (Kim et al., 2006b) and the oral administration of L. lactis transformant producing HpaA in five mice failed to induce humoral immune response to HpaA (Kim et al., 2006a) , these previous and current results suggested that the antigenic protein expressed in the recombinant L. lactis in an intracellular soluble form might be more efficient in eliciting a humoral immune response compared with the antigenic protein expressed as an intracellular insoluble form upon oral administration of the recombinant bacterial cells. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the difference in their capability of inducing a humoral immune response might simply reflect the fact that these Cag7, Cag12, and HpaA are completely different proteins.",

In addition, L. lactis transformant possessing the recombinant plasmid pMG36e/cag7-ct383 was able to synthesize the 41.4-kDa ct383 aa region of the Cag7 protein without extracellular secretion. Oral administration of the recombinant L. lactis expressing Cag7-ct383 to mice appeared to generate the anti-Cag7 antibody in serum, suggesting that it might be used as an oral vaccine to induce protective immunity to H. pylori.",
