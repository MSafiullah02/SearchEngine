We interpreted the urine results in the context of the presence of MERS-CoV RNA and antibodies in each respectively same-time collected nasal swab and serum sample (data in Farag, 2015) . In none of the 23 urine samples, MERS-CoV RNA could be detected while of the corresponding 23 nasal swabs 11 camels tested positive using both tests. The same urine samples were analysed for the presence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies using micro-array technology (Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013; Reusken, Mou, et al., 2013) . We found MERS-CoV specific antibodies in 16 of 23 urine samples while all camels showed such evidence for a (previous) MERS-CoV infection in serum. Based on the observed relative fluorescence, the overall reactivity of the antibodies in sera was higher than of those present in urine (Data not shown). The specificity of the antibodies detected in the serum samples was confirmed by virus neutralization (Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013) .",

These results are in line with data obtained from another field study and experimentally infected dromedaries, indicating the absence of MERS-CoV in camel urine (Adney, 2014; Ali, 2017) . It should be noted that failure to detect the virus in urine in the former field investigation (Ali, 2017) , in contrast to our study, was not linked to dromedaries with MERS-CoV RNA in their nasal swab. Together the studies imply the absence of a role of camel urine in MERS-CoV transmission to humans. However, to establish unequivocally that urine does not play a role in zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV a large cohort study may be needed including animals of different age groups and at different stages of infection with simultaneous and longitudinal sampling of urine, serum and swabs. In the absence of results of such a systematic study, prudence towards consumption of raw camel urine is still indicated.",
