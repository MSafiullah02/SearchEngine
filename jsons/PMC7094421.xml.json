The phase 1 study represented the period in which patients were recruited for the preliminary RCT,11 and the phase 2 study comprised the period of subsequent recruitment for the extended trial. The gap period of nonrecruitment was the time taken to plan the phase 2 study and to apply for external funding to continue with the research project. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the 2 recruitment periods were identical. In brief, the inclusion criteria were preterm infants (1) with birth weight <1500 g, (2) who received less than half of the total daily fluid intake or <75 mL/kg/day of milk feeds by the oral route on day 14 of postnatal age, and (3) with parental consent for entering into the study.11 Infants were excluded if they had the following: (1) lethal congenital abnormalities or chromosomal disorders; (2) congenital cyanotic heart disease; (3) anatomic obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies, such as intestinal malrotation with or without volvulus, stenosis, or atresia, gastroschisis, exomphalos and Hirschsprung\u2019s disease; (4) NEC; or (5) undergone major gastrointestinal surgery within the first 14 days of life.11 The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong for both phase 1 and phase 2 studies, and written parental consent was obtained before randomization and enrolment for each case.",

Cholestatic jaundice is conventionally defined as serum conjugated bilirubin concentration >34 mmol/L (ie, >2 mg/dL) in newborns.2, 19, 20, 21 Although the cut-off value is considered arbitrary and does not necessarily correlate with any specific hepatic pathology, it has been extensively used in neonatal studies.2, 19, 20, 21 The incidence of PNAC in VLBW infants who failed to attain half the expected volume of enteral feeding on day 14 for the past 3 consecutive years was found to vary between 35% and 43%. We made the assumption of decreasing the incidence from 40% to 20% after introducing oral erythromycin, and it was determined that 91 infants would be required in each arm (ie, a total of 182 infants) of an RCT to detect a significant difference at the 5% level and with a power of 80%. Because our experience in the phase 1 study indicated that we could recruit 56 infants with gastrointestinal dysmotility within a period of 19 months, we expected to complete the recruitment of the extra 126 infants within a 43-month period. We managed to enroll the full quota of patients in 50 months (phase 2 study). The delay was most likely due to the substantial drop in admissions to the NICU at the Prince of Wales Hospital during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in March 2003 in Hong Kong because we admitted 2 of the sickest preterm infants born to mothers with SARS-associated coronavirus infection.22 The NICU statistics suggested that the general public took at least 6 to 9 months to regain confidence to give birth at the Prince of Wales Hospital and, hence, could explain the slight delay of the recruitment process.",

Third, we considered starting prokinetic treatment on day 15 of life to be optimal because oral erythromycin was used in this study as a \u201crescue\u201d treatment.

The prevalence in the current study was 41% and is within the range of our estimation. Our results suggested that the incidence of PNAC in the placebo group was doubled compared with infants treated with erythromycin. Thus, the number of VLBW infants with gastrointestinal dysmotility needed to be treated to prevent 1 case of PNAC is estimated to be 5 (95% CI: 2\u20138). This result represents a robust treatment effect. In contrast to PNAC caused by surgical-induced short gut syndrome or intestinal failure in which the infants usually have prolonged parenteral nutrition resulting in hepatic failure and death, advanced liver injury associated with gastrointestinal dysmotility of prematurity is infrequent.1, 2 This observation could be confirmed by the mild to modest increase in serum alanine aminotransferase and the marginal significant increase in conjugated bilirubin concentrations. However, it is important to note that significantly more infants in the placebo group had abnormally raised alanine aminotransferase levels indicating a degree of hepatic damage (Table 2). Furthermore, clinical signs and biochemical parameters may sometimes be deceiving because these indicators do not necessarily correlate closely with disease severity at the late stage of deterioration,1 and rapid decompensation of hepatic function can occur unexpectedly after a relatively short course of parenteral nutrition.1, 36 One infant in the placebo group developed life-threatening hepatic failure with markedly deranged clotting profile, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and frank hematemasis. This infant also had multiple pathologic fractures secondary to osteopenia and substrate deficiency rickets, yet he survived after tolerating full enteral feeding and cessation of hyperalimentation. To date, there is no definitive treatment for PNAC apart from stopping parenteral nutrition, and the only solution to arrest the progression of liver disease is to achieve full enteral nutrition as soon as it is practicable.1 Predictably, the hepatic function in all affected infants was reversible and recovered within 2\u20134 months after stopping parenteral nutrition.",

This finding could be translated into substantial savings both in human resources and cost for preparation of parenteral nutrition and, more importantly, infant exposure to complications of intravascular lines such as the repeated trauma of line insertion10 and recurrent sepsis.8, 9 The principal organisms responsible for septicemia in the current and previous studies in preterm infants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (Table 3).37 Because colonization of indwelling lines with these microorganisms is common after repeated infusions and bactericidal activities of phagocytosis and intracellular killing of coagulase-negative staphylococci in neutrophils are defective during long-term parenteral nutrition,38 shortening the need for hyperalimentation and elimination of intravascular lines could have been responsible for the significant decrease in incidence of recurrent septicemia in erythromycin-treated infants. Recurrent sepsis in the presence of PNAC could result in more rapid deterioration of hepatic function and damage of liver parenchyma by inhibiting hepatocellular bile acid transport and activation of hepatic macrophages via locally produced procholestatic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1.39, 40, 41 Thus, decreasing recurrent sepsis could have the additional benefit of interrupting the vicious cycle for causing further intrahepatic cholestasis and destruction of liver tissue.1\n",

            "text": "In accordance with our previous findings,10, 11 VLBW infants with functional gastrointestinal dysmotility achieved half, three-quarters, and full enteral feeding significantly earlier after treatment with high-dose oral erythromycin compared with the placebo. Nonetheless, there are controversies concerning the effectiveness of erythromycin in promoting enteral feeding.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 To date, of the 8 RCTs reported in the English literature, 3 used erythromycin as a prophylactic prokinetic agent and 5 as rescue treatment.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Of the prophylactic studies, 2 of the 3 RCTs did not reveal any benefit,17, 18 but the third study by Oei and Lui demonstrated that erythromycin-treated infants had significantly fewer episodes of large residual gastric aspirates and were able to attain full oral feeding more quickly.13 Prophylactic studies of such nature, however, do not necessarily reflect the efficacy of erythromycin as a prokinetic agent because infants with protracted feed intolerance are not specifically targeted for treatment. Five RCTs used erythromycin as rescue treatment in preterm newborns with feed intolerance.11, 12, 14, 15, 16 Two of the 5 trials, including our preliminary RCT,11 found erythromycin to be beneficial.11, 12 Our previous study using the same high-dose (12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 14 days) as the current trial revealed that oral erythromycin could shorten the time for achieving full enteral nutrition and that there was a nonsignificant trend of an increased risk for developing PNAC in placebo infants.11 A recent study by Nuntnarumit et al also suggested that the use of an intermediate dose of oral erythromycin (10 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by 4 mg/kg every 6 hours for the next 5 days) could significantly reduce the number of withheld feeds and the time to full feeding.12 In contrast, low-dose rescue treatment (3 mg/kg administered every 6 hours intravenously,16 and 6\u201315 mg/kg/day given orally14, 15) was not useful in facilitating enteral feeding. Two of the latter trials were small, involving no more than 15 patients in each group, and, therefore, might not have adequate statistical power to detect subtle differences in feeding.14, 15 In the third RCT, the infants did not have protracted feed intolerance because the mean time to attain full enteral feeding ranged between 13.6 and 16.4 days in the erythromycin and placebo groups, respectively.16 These investigators concluded that a larger RCT would be warranted to address this important issue. Another plausible explanation for the discrepancy of results between studies could have been related to the different dosages used. It is possible that a higher dosage (ie, an intermediate or a high dose) is required for effective stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract.12, 42\n",

            "text": "Although the exact mechanism in which erythromycin facilitates advancement of enteral feeding is not fully understood, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the prokinetic action is mediated via the motilin pathway principally at the levels of the stomach and proximal small bowel.51, 52, 53 Stimulation of this pathway results in increase in the proximal gastric tone,54 greater amplitude and more frequent antral contractions,55, 56, 57, 58 suppression of pyloric contractions and consequently reducing outlet resistance,52 and increase in the frequency of duodenal contractions.59 Recent studies have indicated the presence of 2 main types of motilin receptors.60 The neural motilin receptors on cholinergic neurons respond to low-dose (1\u20133 mg/kg) erythromycin and predominantly enhances the phase III migrating motor complexes, whereas the smooth muscle motilin receptors respond to higher doses of erythromycin and are mainly responsible for producing sustained antral contractions and facilitating antroduodenal coordination.30, 32, 53, 58 Despite reports suggesting that gut immaturity could have been a crucial factor for the lack of response to erythromycin in infants <32 weeks gestation,51 the current evidence from clinical trials suggests that this could not fully explain the bedside findings.10, 11, 12, 13 There is now evidence to suggest that the development of the gastrointestinal neuroendocrine network is mostly complete by 25 weeks gestation and that the distribution of motilin in the gastrointestinal tract at 20 weeks gestation closely resembles the pattern of distribution in adults.61, 62 Thus, preterm infants at very early gestations are already equipped with the essential anatomic and physiologic apparatus necessary for proper functioning of the bowel. In addition, exposure of the immature bowel to milk or exogenous motilin can result in earlier detection of phase III motor activity than would normally be expected for the gestational age.63, 64, 65 In human studies, a case series performed in preterm infants at 23\u201330 weeks gestations demonstrated that the use of intravenous erythromycin (0.75 mg/kg) could significantly increase antral clusters of contractions. The antral motility index was increased 4-fold and, thus, suggested the presence of functioning motilin receptors at very early gestations.66 In another study, the same group of investigators studied different doses (10 mg vs 3 mg) of erythromycin administered orally and showed that 10 mg but not 3 mg significantly increased gastric emptying.31 It was proposed that a decrease in the pyloric tone coupled with an increase in tone of the proximal stomach could have been responsible for the prokinetic effect.31 A recent crossover study further indicated that oral erythromycin (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) enhanced antral contractility and increased whole gut transit time measured by ultrasonography and the carmine red dye method, respectively.32 In contrast, Jadcherla and Berseth using low-dose oral erythromycin (0.75\u20133 mg/kg) failed to initiate phase III motor migrating complexes in patients <31 weeks gestation but could induce them in a dose-dependent manner in infants \u226532 weeks.67 ElHennawy et al also reported in a RCT that low-dose oral erythromycin (1.5 mg/kg) was unable to induce stronger or more frequent antroduodenal contractions compared with untreated patients and that the transit time from duodenum to anus was similar between the 2 groups.15 Thus, the cumulating evidence suggests that the action of erythromycin for promoting enteral feeding is probably dose as well as age dependent. Because there are clinical data to support that an intermediate or a high oral dose of erythromycin10, 11, 12 is more effective than lower doses14, 15 for rescue treatment, we speculate that the lower intragastric doses are probably insufficient in providing adequate drug concentrations either locally or systemically for exerting the desired prokinetic effects. The time of introduction of milk feeding 9 days (median) prior to commencement of erythromycin and the use of this prokinetic agent as rescue rather than prophylactic treatment could have the advantage of accelerating and allowing time for bowel maturation such that the gut may become more susceptible to prokinetic drug stimulation.63, 64, 65\n",

            "text": "No major adverse effect was encountered with oral erythromycin. In particular, none of the studied infants had infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis within the study period. The relatively low incidence of pyloric stenosis in Chinese babies68 coupled with erythromycin administration not earlier than day 13 of life29 have probably minimized the risk of developing this complication. Thus far, none of the other RCTs encountered this problem.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Because the incidence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is estimated to be 1\u20133 cases per 1000 live births,69 an 8-fold increase in risk because of erythromycin29 would substantially increase the incidence to 8\u201324 cases per 1000 livebirths (ie, 1 case in 41- to 125-treated infants). This prevalence should have been detected by this or the combination of clinical trials.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Therefore, the effect of erythromycin on infantile hypertropic pyloric stenosis is likely to be small, and the benefits probably outweigh its risks. Three infants developed transient ventricular ectopics (Table 2). The infant in the erythromycin group developed the dysrhythmia on day 5 and before administration of prokinetic treatment, whereas the other 2 infants developed ventricular ectopics before and during placebo treatment. All patients recovered spontaneously within 12 hours of onset. No definitive cause was found. The QTc intervals before and during drug administration were similar between the 2 groups. The use of erythromycin was also not associated with an increase risk of NEC. The prevalence of NEC in the NICU has been significantly improved after introduction of new hand hygiene measures70 and remained at a very low level during the study period. Importantly, the stool culture surveillance showed that the pattern of microorganisms did not change significantly between erythromycin-treated and placebo infants. One culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a placebo infant, and the emergence of Stenotrophomonas species was associated with the use of carbapenem antibiotics in these patients (Table 4). There was no outbreak of infection and NEC or emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms within the 69-month study period.",

            "text": "There are limitations in this study. First, the RCT was performed in a single center, and the results may not be generalizable to other NICUs. However, the strong treatment effect suggests that the data are robust, and attending neonatologists should be able to observe similar beneficial effects in their own population. One could also argue that the majority of PNAC cases were mild and question whether an antimicrobial agent in therapeutic dose should be initiated for treatment of such a benign condition. However, a life-threatening case with hepatic failure was observed during the study period. In addition, the duration for requirement of parenteral nutrition and the incidence of recurrent septicemia were significantly decreased. The absence of any major adverse effects such as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias should justify the use of oral erythromycin as a \u201crescue\u201d measure for infants with moderately severe gastrointestinal dysmotility. Undoubtedly, the future development of a new generation of macrolide analogues devoid of antibiotic activity but retaining motilinomimetic properties would be a distinct advantage.71, 72 Second, much effort had been focused on identifying multidrug-resistant organisms in both blood and stool cultures because the study was performed in an intensive care setting. However, these conventional microbiologic culture techniques might not be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes of microflora in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies suggested that the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents in the early perinatal period could disturb normal developmental gene expression, impair maturation of the bowel protective barrier, interfere with the proper formation of the mucus gel layer overlying the gut epithelium, and change the pattern of microbial colonization in the gastrointestinal tract.73, 74 Such modulating effects on the critical suckling-weaning transitional period could have long-lasting consequences because changes in the microbiota and gut mucosal barrier might potentially be associated with increased susceptibility to infection or developing inflammatory or atopic diseases in later life.74 In this aspect, microbial genomic analysis or DNA microarray analysis would be of value in future studies to identify any alteration of the bowel microbiota and long-term effects of antibiotics on the gut microenvironment.",

            "text": "In summary, this is the largest RCT of oral erythromycin for assessing its prokinetic effect in preterm infants and is also the first study to assess clinical outcomes systematically. Our findings suggest that the use of a rescue high-dose oral erythromycin could effectively reduce the incidence of PNAC by 50% in VLBW infants with moderately severe gastrointestinal dysmotility. In addition, the treatment is also associated with an earlier time (10.1 days) to achieve full enteral feeding, decreasing the requirement for parenteral nutrition, and reducing the number of recurrent septicemia. No major adverse effects or life-threatening complications were encountered. The findings also demonstrate the importance of using the medication appropriately in a sufficiently \u201chigh-dose\u201d and as a \u201crescue\u201d therapy. These favorable data should strengthen the confidence of neonatal clinicians in using oral erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in moderate to severe cases. Although the current evidence suggests that the use of oral erythromycin at the antimicrobial dose is probably safe and does not readily promote the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, the sample size may still be inadequate to detect subtle adverse effects or outcomes in the long-term. Thus, oral erythromycin in a sufficient dosage can be considered after day 14 of life as a rescue treatment in preterm infants who fail to establish adequate enteral nutrition and in whom anatomically obstructive pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract have been excluded. We, however, caution against prophylactic or routine use of erythromycin as a prokinetic agent because the data from prophylactic RCTs have not been convincing and its safety profile, especially its influence on bowel microbiota and gut protective barrier, needs to be further addressed.",
