ORF8a and ORF8b are predicted to encode two small proteins, 8a and 8b, and ORF8 a single protein, 8ab (a fusion form of 8a and 8b). To understand the functions of these proteins, we cloned cDNA fragments covering these ORFs into expression plasmids, and expressed the constructs in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Expression of a construct containing ORF8a and ORF8b generated only a single protein, 8a; no 8b protein expression was obtained. Expression of a construct containing ORF8 generated the 8ab fusion protein. Site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic treatment revealed that protein 8ab is modified by N-linked glycosylation on the N81 residue and by ubiquitination. In the absence of the 8a region, protein 8b undergoes rapid degradation by proteasomes, and addition of proteasome inhibitors inhibits the degradation of protein 8b as well as the protein 8b-induced rapid degradation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus E protein.",

Subgenomic mRNA8 from most SARS-CoV isolates obtained from animals and patients at early stages of the SARS epidemic contains a single ORF8 with potential to encode a single protein, 8ab [7] . A 29 nucleotide deletion between T27867 and A27868 for strain SG2774 (accession number AY283798) was found in strains collected from human isolates at late stages of the outbreak, resulting in the splitting of the single ORF8 into two overlapping ORFs, ORF8a and ORF8b ( Fig. 1 ) [1, 8] . The deletion of the 29 nucleotides and the formation of two overlapping ORFs were predicted to be the consequence of adaptation of SARS-CoV from animals to humans [7, 9] . Experimental infection of civets with SARS-CoV isolates BJ01 (without the 29 nucleotides) and GZ01 (with the 29 nucleotides) showed that animals infected with strain BJ01 tend to have a higher average temperature and slightly stronger antibody responses [10] . Two recent studies have shown that the putative protein 8b can downregulate the SARS-CoV E protein in virus-infected cells and induce DNA synthesis in cells expressing the protein [11, 12] . However, more detailed characterization of the expression, biochemical properties and functions of the products encoded by these two mRNA isoforms has yet to be done.",

Expression of the protein was also observed in Cos-7 cells, as a Flag-tagged protein. Similarly, translation of ORF8ab was observed in all the translation systems used. In contrast, protein 8b was expressed only when ORF8b was separately cloned. When constructs containing the two overlapping ORFs ORF8a \u2044 ORF8b and the single ORF8ab, respectively, were expressed, expression of proteins 8a and 8ab were observed. Protein 8ab was shown to be an N-linked glycosylated protein, and the glycosylation site was identified to be the N81 residue. Proteins 8b and 8ab could be modified by ubiquitination, and in the absence of the 8a region, protein 8b undergoes rapid degradation by proteasome. Addition of the proteasome inhibitors inhibits the degradation of protein 8b as well as the protein 8b-induced rapid degradation of the SARS-CoV E protein. In addition, glycosylation could also stabilize protein 8ab. Furthermore, proteins 8b and 8ab could bind covalently and noncovalently to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin. As no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) was found, they may represent a novel group of ubiquitin-binding proteins.",

Owing to the deletion of 29 nucleotides [between T27867 and A27868 for strain SG2774 (accession number AY283798)], two overlapping ORFs (ORF8a \u2044 ORF8b) were found in most human isolates (Fig. 1 ). ORF8a and ORF8b are predicted to encode two small proteins, 8a and 8b, whereas ORF8 encodes a single protein, 8ab, representing a fused form of proteins 8a and 8b. To understand the functions of these proteins, cDNA fragments covering these ORFs were cloned into pFlag, giving rise to five constructs either with or without a Flag-tag at the N-terminus (Fig. 1) . These constructs were then expressed in both in vitro expression systems and in intact cells. When constructs p8a \u2044 b, pF-8a \u2044 b, pF-8b and pF-8ab were expressed in TnT transcription-coupled translation wheat germ extracts in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine, single protein bands of approximately 5.3, 6.5, 10.2 and 14.4 kDa, representing untagged protein 8a, Flag-tagged protein 8a, Flag-tagged protein 8b and Flag-tagged protein 8ab, respectively, were detected ( Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4) . Expression of the same four constructs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine gave rise to the same four products (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4) . In addition, a series of bands (ladder bands) with increases of approximately 10 kDa were detected when pF-8b and pF-8ab were expressed in the system (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4) . The patterns of these bands suggest that they may represent ubiquitinated forms of proteins 8b and 8ab. To determine whether these bands are related to the 8b region, immunoprecipitation was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to protein 8b. As shown in Fig. 2B , the 10.2 kDa protein 8b and the 14.4 kDa protein 8ab, together with their corresponding ladder bands, were precipitated with the antibodies (lanes 7 and 8). The fact that these bands were efficiently immunoprecipitated by the antibodies to protein 8b suggests that proteins 8b and 8ab may be modified by ubiquitination.",

This ORF was previously speculated to be translationally silent [14] , and no antibodies against the protein have been found in patients [16] . Although ORF8b was located downstream of a weak transcriptional regulatory sequence (CUAAUAA ACUCAUG) [1] , no additional subgenomic mRNA starting from this position was identified. If protein 8b was synthesized from ORF8a \u2044 ORF8b, it would be unlikely to be translated by the conventional ribosomal scanning mechanism. Protein 8ab was found to be post-translationally modified by N-linked glycosylation on the N81 residue. Although the same residue is present in protein 8b, glycosylation of protein 8b was not detected. Glycosylation plays a fundamental role in the oligomerization, sorting, transport and folding of proteins [18] . During glycosylation, glycan residues are transferred to Asn of the target sequence motif Asn-X-Ser \u2044 Thr on a nascent peptide by oligosaccharyltransferase in eukaryotic cells [19] . The glycan is the 'admission ticket' for proteins to undergo folding or oligomerization, sorting and transport [18] . Substitution mutation of the N81 to an Asp in protein 8ab made the protein more susceptible to degradation. In the absence of the 8a region, protein 8b was also rapidly degraded, as the protein was not glycosylated, although it contains the potential target sequence motif for glycosylation. It is therefore speculated that glycosylation may assist in folding of protein 8b. In general, the folding process happens in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus [20, 21] . In the ER, the calnexin-calreticulin cycle is involved in the folding process of glycosylated proteins [22] . In this process, calnexin and calreticulin bind transiently to glycosylated proteins, and subsequently form a complex with cochaperone ERp57 [23] . The three-protein complex folds glycosylated proteins by forming the appropriate disulfide bonds [24] . Protein 8ab is rich in cysteine residues in the 8a region, and may attain the correct conformation by forming disulfide bonds in this region.",

The noncovalent binding of proteins 8b and 8ab to ubiquitin suggests that the two proteins may contain a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). UBDs are able to bind to ubiquitin noncovalently and covalently [25] . So far, nine UBDs, such as the ubiquitin-binding motif and ubiquitin-associated domain, have been identified [26] [27] [28] . Many UBDs were initially discovered by homol-ogy search with the identified UBDs [25, 29, 30] . However, proteins 8b and 8ab do not share homology with any known UBD, suggesting that they might contain a novel UBD. As proteins 8b and 8ab but not protein 8a are conjugated with polyubiquitin and form complexes with monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin, the novel UBD is probably located in the 8b region. Ubiquitin conjugation of UBDs could facilitate the formation of complexes between a UBD and free mono \u2044 polyubiquitin. It is generally believed that UBDs are able to bind to other ubiquitinated proteins [25] , disrupting the function or transportation of polyubiquitinated proteins [27, 28] . As ubiquitination and degradation of cellular proteins by proteasomes may play an important role in maintaining a constant level of these proteins in cells [30, 31] , a wider effect of proteins 8b and 8ab on cellular ubiquitinated proteins would be expected.",

            "text": "Another intriguing and essential issue is whether splitting of the single ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b by the deletion of 29 nucleotides is evolutionarily advantageous. The following considerations and clues provided by this study would suggest that it is beneficial to the virus. First, as splitting of the single ORF8 results in the formation of a bicistronic mRNA species, expression of the downstream ORF8b would be regulated by various translational control mechanisms. Evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo expression of constructs containing the two separate ORFs suggests that the downstream ORF is either silent or expressed at a low level. It is unclear at the moment whether this ORF is expressed in virus-infected cells. One recent study found positive staining in some of the SARS-CoV-infected cells with polyclonal antibodies to protein 8b, suggesting that the protein may be expressed [11] . Second, the data presented in this study show that the 8b region may contain multiple functional domains, such as for ubiquitin binding, ubiquitination and glycosylation, involved in the regulation of the stability, host-virus interaction and biochemical properties of protein 8ab. However, no functional domain has so far identified in the 8a region of the protein. Although protein 8a would certainly be expressed from the bicistronic mRNA8, the absence of the 8b region would result in the loss of the functions assigned to the 8b region of protein 8ab. Finally, as ubiquitination and the binding to mono \u2044 polyubiqutins, as well as ubiquitinated cellular proteins, may regulate cellular signaling pathways involved in the host antiviral response, silencing the expression of protein 8ab may constitute a viral strategy to evade the host antiviral defense mechanisms. More systematic studies of the functions of these proteins are required to address this issue further.",

Briefly, five fragments spanning the entire IBV genome were obtained by RT-PCR from Vero cells infected with the Vero cell-adapted IBV p65. The PCR products were purified from agarose gels and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or pGEM-T Easy (Promega) vectors. Subsequently, fragment A was removed from pCR-XL-TOPO by digestion with NheI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pKT0 vector. Plasmids were digested with either BsmBI (fragment A) or BsaI (fragments B, C, D and E). The digested plasmids were separated on 0.8% agarose gels containing crystal violet. Bands corresponding to each of the fragments were cut from the gels and purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Fragments A and B, and fragments C, D and E, were first ligated with T4 DNA ligase at 4\u00b0C overnight. The two reaction mixtures were then mixed and further ligated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The final ligation products were extracted with phenol \u2044 chloroform \u2044 isoamyl alcohol (25 : 24 : 1), precipitated with ethanol, and detected by electrophoresis on 0.4% agarose gels.",
