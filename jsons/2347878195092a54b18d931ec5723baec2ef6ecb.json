Some attempts to standardize and give 72 recommendations are on the way (Schinke et al., 2020). Artificial intelligence and digital-based platforms 73 can potentially provide immediate help, and consequently, recommendations or psychological 74 interventions can be provided.75In planning for the post-COVID-19 pandemic, sport related organizations must consider a regular 76 built-in infection control measure of risk-benefit evaluation and the available resources needed to 77 administer it in a team training environment. Essential travel after re-opening should be evaluated and 78 decided on a case-by-case basis, balancing benefits, risks, and risk mitigation options, which might be 79 affected by the damaged post-pandemic economy.",

However, a number of potential issues remain to be addressed for elite 48 athletes, one of which being a widespread concern about mental health issues (World Health49Organization, 2020 b).
