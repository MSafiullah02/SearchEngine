            "text": "In March 2003, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of SARS (Ksiazek et al., 2003). The virus has been demonstrated to induce fever, edema, and diffuse alveolar damage in severely affected individuals (Poutanen et al., 2003). Similar to other coronaviruses in structure, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, 29.7 kb nucleotides in length, that encodes four viral structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, the matrix (M) protein, the small envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003). The gene encoding for the 46-kDa SARS-CoV N protein directly precedes the 3\u2032-UTR of the viral genome (Rota et al., 2003). For coronaviruses, the N protein plays an important role during viral packaging, viral core formation, and viral RNA synthesis (Narayanan, Chen, Maeda, & Makino, 2003). The SARS-CoV N protein shares homology with N protein from other members of the coronavirus family. However, it contains a short lysine-rich sequence (362-KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ-381) near the carboxyl terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal that has not been found in the N proteins of any other known coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003). This suggested that the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein might have novel functions in pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV N protein has been reported to form a dimmer by self-association (He et al., 2004), to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway (He et al., 2003), and to induce actin reorganization in COS-1 cells (Sutjit et al., 2004).",

A short lysine-rich region near the carboxyl terminus of SARS-CoV N protein has been identified as a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (Marra et al., 2003). Since C/EBP and NF-\u03baB regulatory elements are required for the expression of COX-2 gene activated by N protein. It is reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV N protein function may through binding to C/EBP and NF-\u03baB regulatory elements. To confirm this speculation, we conducted electrophoresis mobility shift assay to define protein\u2013DNA binding between N protein and COX-2 promoter. 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 3A and B, lanes 1\u20133) or a plasmid containing the N gene (Fig. 3A and B, lanes 4\u20136). Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells and EMSA was performed with 4 \u03bcg of nuclear extract in binding buffer. To assure the specific binding of transcription factors to the probe, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were added prior to the addition of labeled probe (Fig. 3A and B, lanes 1 and 4). To determine whether N protein was specific bound to the promoter, rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody was incubated with nuclear extracts before adding the binding buffer (Fig. 3A and B, lanes 3 and 6). DNA probes used in this study contained either the C/EBP element (Fig. 3A) or the NF-\u03baB-A elements (Fig. 3B) from COX-2 promoter. Samples were then electrophoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. Results from EMSA using C/EBP probe showed that a specific protein\u2013DNA complex was supershifted in cells transfected with plasmid expressing N protein (Fig. 3A, lane 6).

The COX-2 promoter region (\u2212155 to \u22122) containing C/EBP binding sequences, excluding NF-\u03baB site was also amplified from anti-N protein precipitation by PCR using C/EBP-specific primers (C/EBP-CP1 and CP2) (Fig. 4C, lane 2). All amplified products from immunoprecipitated DNA were specific for cells transfected with plasmid expressing N protein and were the expected sizes, comparing PCR products from immunoprecipitation with PCR products amplified directly from input DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4; Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3).

To determine the roles of different regions of N protein in the activation of COX-2 gene expression, we carried out a functional analysis of the protein by deletion mutagenesis. Sequential N-terminal deletion mutants of the SARS-CoV N protein were generated by deleting nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the N protein gene and inserting the truncated gene into vector pCMV-Tag2 (Fig. 5A). The function of each mutant N gene was evaluated by luciferase assay following transfection of 293T cells with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene driven by the COX-2 promoter. Results from luciferase activity assays (Fig. 5B) showed that deletion of amino acids from 1 to 61 (N\u03941), 1 to 136 (N\u03942), or 1 to 204 (N\u03943) from the N terminal of the protein, respectively, had no effects on its function in terms of COX-2 gene activation, whereas deletions of amino acids from 1 to 269 (N\u03944) significantly decreased the level of reporter gene expression. Further deletion from 1 to 333 (N\u03945) entirely abolished luciferase activity. These results suggested that sequences located from amino acids from 204 to 269 are essential for the activation of COX-2 gene by N protein.",

In addition, the region from amino acids 204 to 269 at N terminal of the protein appeared to be essential for the activation of COX-2 expression. Based on our results and previously reported findings, it is reasonable for us to suggest that N protein activates COX-2 gene expression by binding either directly or indirectly to NF-\u03baB and C/EBP regulatory elements on COX-2 promoter. Results from electrophoresis mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein activated COX-2 gene expression by binding directly to C/EBP and NF-\u03baB regulatory elements on the promoter. It is most likely that amino acids from 136 to 204 of N protein were involved in the protein\u2013DNA or protein\u2013protein binding.

Our results suggested that the N protein is a three-domain protein, with the N-terminal amino acids 136\u2013204 as the DNA-binding domain, amino acids 257\u2013263 (KKPRQKR) at the middle as the nuclear localization signal domain, and the C-terminal amino acids 169\u2013422 as the dimerization domain.",

COX-2 gene is regulated through interactions between NF-\u03baB and C/EBP factors (Thomas et al., 2000). This study demonstrated that both NF-\u03baB site and C/EBP site were involved in the activation of COX-2 by the N protein of SARS-CoV. The ability of virus infection to activate multiple signaling cascades (such as PKR, MAPK, iPLA2, and NF-\u03baB) and how these pathways are integrated in the regulation of individual target gene expression have been discussed previously (Steer & Corbett, 2003). However, the details of molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of COX-2 regulated by the N protein need further investigation.",
