However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.",

SARS-CoV infection results in severe and potentially fatal lung disease [1, 2] . Although the majority of patients recovered after 1-2 weeks of debilitating febrile illness, a substantial proportion (up to one-third) developed severe inflammation of the lung, requiring ventilator support and intensive care. Many patients in this group deteriorated into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality of this group of patients is high [3] . Manifestations in other organ systems are characteristic. Lymphopenia [4] , gastrointestinal symptoms [5] , impaired liver function [6, 7] , and impaired renal function [8] are common. The possibility of viral infection in multiple organs has been raised and viral replication in the lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract was reported [9, 10] . In addition, prolonged shedding of virus was found in some convalescent patients [11] . However, chronic infection by SARS-CoV has not, to date, been documented in humans. Moreover, asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV is rare [12] .",

Virus particles can also be seen budding through the cytoplasmic membrane (B).

These reports thus reflect the terminal stages and are likely to represent only the more severe end of the spectrum of SARS. Treatment and co-morbid conditions might also modify the pathological changes. Diffuse alveolar damage at different stages of organization is the most consistent finding in the lungs of SARS patients in the terminal stage (Figures 2A-2F ). Multinucleated syncytial cells ( Figures 2G and 2H ) are characteristic, although these cells are rare. Apart from when secondary infection occurs, the lack of a prominent inflammatory response is also distinctive. SARS-CoV is explicitly detected in the alveolar lining cells ( Figures 2I and 2J ) [10, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . No specific pathology is identified in the gastrointestinal tract ( Figure 3) [5], urinary system [8] , or other organ systems [28] , apart from that related to end-stage multi-organ failure or those changes secondary to treatment. It is important to note that in some organs such as the liver, while definitive and distinct morphological and functional changes are observed, SARS-CoV may not be unequivocally demonstrable [29] .",

Both acute and organized stages of diffuse alveolar damage were seen when the macaques were sacrificed on the sixth day after a heavy dose of the virus. SARS-CoV was detected in the alveolar epithelial cells and in the intra-alveolar syncytial cells.

In a mouse model of alveolar damage induced by acid aspiration, the balance of the renin-angiotensin system appears to affect the development of DAD. ACE2, which acts as a negative regulator of the local renin-angiotensin system, protects the mouse lung against experimental damage [47, 48] . SARS-CoV co-infection in these damaged animals downregulates ACE2 in the lungs of infected mice and the severity of lung damage can be alleviated by blocking the system [49] . Exciting as these findings appear, the case of a new coronavirus, NL63, immediately provides an example that other factors are acting in the overall mechanism of lung damage. NL63 utilizes the same ACE2 protein as its receptor in the lung. However, infection with NL63 results in only minor cold symptoms and alveolar damage is rare [50] . The insert/deletion genotype of the ACE gene was associated with DAD after SARS-CoV infection in a small cohort of 44 patients [51] . This association was, however, not replicated subsequently in a larger series [52] . We also could not detect any association between the ACE2 genotype and disease severity in SARS-CoV infection [53] .",

With the observation of characteristic lymphopenia in SARS, it has been postulated that the SARS-CoV may similarly trigger an exaggerated hyper-cytokinemic response in patients with DAD after viral infection [20] . Current understanding indicates that patients with a more intense immune response are those at risk of a poor outcome, as the immune system also mounts a profound reaction to the bystander, the lung parenchyma, and causes DAD [76] . SARS patients have variable humoral responses to individual epitopes [66] . However, early sero-conversion and high peak total SARS-CoV IgG levels were associated with more severe disease in a cohort of 325 patients [77] . Hence, particularly strong humoral responses to SARS-CoV infection might not be protective but, perhaps, might be harmful to the host.

In another cohort of 22 SARS patients, immune activity against antigens from lung epithelial cell lines and endothelial cell lines was found in some patients' sera obtained approximately 1 month after infection [78] . Moreover, high levels of these autoimmune activities in the sera were shown to be cytotoxic to lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells in culture. Autoimmune antibodies may be important in mediating tissue damage at certain stages of the disease. The cause of the autoimmunity is not fully understood. These autoantibodies may be the result of humoral responses to innate antigens exposed accidentally during direct damage of the lung and, perhaps, the endothelium by SARS-CoV. Alternatively, autoimmunity may be due to crossreactivity of antibodies against some specific epitopes of the SARS-CoV proteins.",

Most cytokines showed only transient and short-lived activation in patients after SARS-CoV infection [82] . Even in patients who developed DAD, most cytokine concentrations were not significantly increased [83] . In contrast, circulating concentrations of several chemokines, including CXCL9 (chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 or monokine induced by \u03b3 -interferon), CXCL10 (chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10 or interferoninducible protein-10), and CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2 or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), were markedly increased in SARS patients [82, 84, 85] . Remarkably, the circulating concentration of CXCL10 measured early after infection is an independent prognostic indicator of disease outcome [86] . These chemokines therefore appear to be important elements of the pathogenesis of SARS.",

Global gene expression profiles, generated by cDNA microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after in vitro exposure to SARS-CoV, also reveal the importance of chemokine activation. Within 1 day after exposure to the virus, a number of chemokines (including CXCL10, CXCL9, and CCL2) were activated [90] . PBMCs and macrophages do not support productive infection as viral replication is abortive and no infectious virus is produced. The roles of these cell types in the pathogenesis of SARS remain to be clarified. Nonetheless, these easily obtainable cell types provide convenient experimental models and allow some insight into the patterns of host responses to the infection to be studied. Similar findings were also reported in other cell types, such as dendritic cells, where the cytokine expression profiles are predominantly of inflammatory chemokines CCL3 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 3), CCL5 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 5), CXCL10, and CCL2. Unlike the usual response of dendritic cells to viral infection, anti-viral cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1 (interferonalpha), IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 , and IL-12B, were not activated [58] .",

The difference in genetic makeup between individuals is mostly accounted for by single base differences (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). Many studies have shown an association between SNPs and predisposition to ARDS, and survival after sepsis or other insults [91, 92] . In the context of predisposition to ARDS after trauma, among parameters such as circulating concentrations of IL-1, tumour necrosis factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and the genotype of PAI-1, insertion alleles at the promoter of PAI-1 were associated with high concentrations of PAI-1 in the plasma and a poor survival rate [93] . In addition to PAI-1, other genetic polymorphisms, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) [94] , CD14 [95] , surfactant protein [96] , and HLA genotypes [97] , are also associated with predisposition to, severity, and outcome of ARDS. Although SASR-CoV utilizes ACE2 as its receptor and ACE2 is known to be an important protector of lung damage in experimental ARDS, we and other groups found no solid association between alleles of the two ACE genes (ACE and ACE2 ) and the severity of ARDS after SARS infection [52, 53, 98] .",

Among 37 Taiwanese SARS patients, HLA-B * 4601 was associated with both predisposition to infection and severity of infection [99] . However, the association of this allele was replicated in another Chinese community of Hong Kong involving 90 SARS patients [100] . HLA-B * 0703 was found to be a predisposition allele in the latter study. It should be noted that this latter allele is rare and is found in \u223c3% of the general population. Hence, this allele cannot be considered a major predisposition factor for SARS infection [100] . Immunogenotype may play a role in determining the severity of host responses. There is considerable variability in the prevalence of immunogenotypes among different populations and the significance of detecting so-called 'predisposing' alleles in clinical practice is questionable. More studies are needed to uncover fully the real genetic determinants for both predisposition to infection and the host-pathogen interaction after infection with the virus.",
