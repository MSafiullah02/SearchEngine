It is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Healthcare workers in affected countries were exposed to the regular use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as the N95 mask, gloves, and gowns. Our aim was to study the prevalence of adverse skin reactions to PPE among healthcare workers in Singapore during the SARS outbreak. Healthcare staff in the National Skin Centre and Tan Tock Seng Hospital were surveyed using questionnaires. Of those asked to participate, 322 (94.7%) agreed. 14.3% of the respondents were doctors, 73.0% nurses, and 12.7% other ancillary staff. Mean age of respondents was 32.4 years, with the majority being women (85.7%) and Chinese (53.7%). 109 (35.5%) of the 307 staff who used masks regularly reported acne (59.6%), facial itch (51.4%), and rash (35.8%) from N95 mask use. 64 (21.4%) of the 299 who used gloves regularly reported dry skin (73.4%), itch (56.3%), and rash (37.5%).

These are generally used to protect against highly transmissible respiratory infections such as tuberculosis. 'N' stands for NIOSH -the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the USA, and '95' indicates its filter efficiency. Hence, the mask is 95% efficient at filtering out particles of size 300 nm and above. The SARS coronavirus is 100 nm in size, but when expelled from patients, is usually larger because it is enveloped in saliva as droplets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gowns"}, {"text": "The masks are made of polypropylene fabric, using a nonwoven technology that increases the density and filtering function (4) . The most common adverse reaction reported to the N95 mask was acne, and this has 2 plausible explanations. First, a hot and humid microclimate is created in regions of the face covered by the mask, which predisposes to a flare-up of acne. Secondly, occlusion of pilosebaceous ducts due to local pressure on the skin from the close-fitting mask could result in a flare-up of acne (5) . Itch and rash were reported frequently as well with most cases probably due to irritant contact dermatitis from components of the mask. True allergic contact dermatitis may occur to adhesives used in the masks or to mask components such as rubber straps or metal clips. Patch testing would be necessary to determine the true incidence of such cases. As for the 8 cases who reported pigmentation with mask use, a possible cause is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or perhaps even pigmented contact dermatitis. A few patients also suffered from pressure-related effects of mask use, as illustrated by answers such as 'scar at nosebridge' and 'redness of nosebridge' in the questionnaires. Skin reactions to gloves included complaints of dry skin, itch, and rash. Type I immunoglobulin E-mediated natural rubber latex hypersensitivity is an important, often undiagnosed, occupational health hazard for healthcare workers, especially in those with high exposure. Rates of sensitization ranging from 3% to 17% have been reported in the west. The most common clinical manifestations include contact urticaria, presenting with pruritus, erythema and/or wheals, eczematous lesions, rhinitis, and occupational asthma. In a recent study conducted in Singapore, a prevalence rate of latex sensitization of 9.6% was reported among healthcare workers (6) . Latex sensitization could explain the symptoms reported by some individuals in our study, while a more likely explanation could be the increased frequency of hand-washing and exposure to soaps by healthcare staff, resulting in an irritant contact dermatitis of the hands. As would be expected, few respondents reported adverse skin reactions with the use of gowns.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1856, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gowns"}, {"text": "Our study provides evidence of a high frequency of adverse skin reactions, with prolonged use of PPE, the N95 mask and rubber gloves in particular. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been described elsewhere in the dermatological literature. It is important to note, however, that the reported skin reactions could not be verified and documented by investigators, but were purely based on the subjective assessment of the healthcare staff themselves. In addition, we were unable to determine the severity of the skin reactions through the self-administered questionnaires although it would be reasonable to conclude that most reactions were of mild to moderate severity as most staff continued to use the equipment and few sought formal treatment with a physician. This study nonetheless provides an insight into the frequency of dermatological problems, which could arise from prolonged use of PPE.
