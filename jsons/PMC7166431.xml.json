The results revealed that HRV is not only a major viral etiology of pneumonia but also the second leading cause of bronchiolitis after RSV, corroborating previous studies.2, 3, 17, 18 Unlike RSV, HRV showed similar incidence rates between the bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases. Many prospective long\u2010term studies have shown that RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis is associated with later development of asthma.19, 20 However, a recent cohort study suggested that infants wheezing as a result of HRV infection may be at greater risk of subsequent asthma compared with RSV, PIV, and influenza virus\u2010infected counterparts.21 Therefore, HRV is not only a cause of lower respiratory tract illness but also represents a significant pathogen associated with wheezing, and routine detection of rhinovirus should be performed in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections, especially wheezing. Furthermore, HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infection cases were much numerous than HRV\u2010B cases in both pneumonia and bronchiolitis groups. Previous research indicated that HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infections were more prevalent than HRV\u2010B18, 22 and caused more severe respiratory illnesses.22, 23 Besides, Nakagome et al10 infected bronchial epithelial cells under air\u2010liquid interface conditions with rhinovirus and found that HRV\u2010B has slower replication and lower cellular cytotoxicity compared with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C. This might explain why HRV\u2010B is detected at a lower frequency and causes a milder disease.

Patients with HRV single infection presented more often a history of eczema than the RSV and HRV + non\u2010RSV groups, which accorded with findings in a multicenter study.6 Furthermore, the COAST study evaluated the relationship between HRV illness and allergic sensitization and showed that allergic sensitization may precede rhinovirus associated wheezing but not RSV infection.30 This may be partly explained by that more and more children develop allergies with age, which makes them more sensitive to HRV infection.",

HRV single infection patients with pneumonia were more likely to have a history of wheezing compared with the RSV single infection and HRV + non\u2010RSV infection. An Italian cohort study showed that the rate of recurrent wheezing is higher after hospitalization with HRV bronchiolitis than with other respiratory viruses during a 1\u2010year follow\u2010up period.31 Moreover, a study performed in the United States demonstrated that HRV wheezing in the first 3 years of life is a much stronger risk factor for asthma development at the age of 6 years compared with RSV associated wheezing or aeroallergen sensitization.32 Taken together, HRV infection in early life is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing disease and asthma development. Compared with children infected with RSV alone, cases with HRV alone and HRV coinfection had similar LOS values. Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen and tachypnea were not different among the HRV single infection and the other three groups. Our findings corroborated studies performed in Netherland and Spain,27, 33 but were in contrast with previous reports showing that hospital duration in children with HRV single infection is shorter7 or longer than 28 that of children with RSV infection. Patients with HRV single infection had a higher frequency of fever and slightly elevated leucocyte amounts in HRV\u2010infected patients with pneumonia compared with the RSV and HRV + RSV groups, similar to findings by O. Adams.17 This might be associated with large amounts of IL\u20108 released during HRV infection; IL\u20108 is known as a neutrophil chemotactic factor and induces chemotaxis in neutrophils and other granulocytes.34 Of note, pneumonia cases associated with HRV + non\u2010RSV infection frequently presented in summer, which may be due to viruses other than HRV and RSV. HRV single infection\u2010induced bronchiolitis more likely in winter than the other three infection groups, indicating that rhinovirus is an important pathogen that causes bronchiolitis in winter.",

We found that both Th1\u2010type (IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102, and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and Th2\u2010type (IL\u20104, IL\u20106, and IL\u201010) cytokines significantly increased in HRV or RSV infected patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Previous studies demonstrated that HRV infection causes a massive upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the host,37 and Th2\u2010type cytokines may reflect a chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract.38 Th2\u2010type cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u201010, and IL\u201013 favor HRV infection by increasing the expression of ICAM\u20101.34 A research in the UK demonstrated that the IL\u20104/IFN\u2010\u03b3 ratio in infants with acute bronchiolitis elevated in nasal lavage fluid sample on both days 1 to 2 and days 5 to 7 of disease compared with infants suffering from upper respiratory tract infection alone.39 Moreover, a recent study showed that the majority of HRV\u2010infected infants display a high Th2 response, while the majority of RSV\u2010infected infants show a Type\u20101 response.40 In the current study, Th2/Th1 ratios were higher in HRV and RSV associated bronchiolitis compared with pneumonia and control cases, reflected by increased IL\u20104/IFN\u2010\u03b3 and decreased TNF\u2010\u03b1/IL\u201010 ratios, which suggested that excessive Th2 or deficient Th1 response may be associated with the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis. The reason why IL\u20106/IL\u20102 ratios were not significantly different between bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases in both HRV and RSV groups is difficult to explain. However, it may be explained by that IL\u20106 represents a potent mediator of cellular communication, is crucial for the regulation of innate and adaptive inflammatory responses,41 and is positively associated with illness severity in RSV and HRV associated lower respiratory tract infection.42, 43 Taken together, an imbalanced Th1/Th2 response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis and may be one of the reasons for asthma development.",
