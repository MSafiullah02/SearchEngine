            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening disease caused by a new member of a diverse group of large, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses of the family Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV) [1]. Although in the 2 years since the discovery of SARS much has been learnt about its pathogenesis, epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis, progress has been less rapid in other areas, particularly in establishing an antiviral treatment for patients. Steroids with or without ribavirin have been widely employed in the treatment of SARS but have not been very effective [2, 3]. However, several studies have reported that type I interferons (IFNs) can inhibit SARS replication in vitro [4] and, specifically, that IFN-\u03b2 exhibits the most potent anti-SARS-CoV activity in Vero cells, showing levels of inhibition at concentrations of 1,000 IU/ml or greater [5, 6, 7, 8]. IFN-\u03b1 has been tested in non-human primates experimentally infected with SARS, but the actual therapeutic efficacy of post-exposure treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 has yet to be established [9]. With regard to the antiviral activity of IFNs, we have previously reported that simultaneous treatment with IFN-\u03b2, at various concentrations, and 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b3 acted synergistically against SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells [10]. Similar synergistic antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 against SARS-CoV has also been demonstrated by others [11] under different experimental conditions, namely using higher doses of IFN-\u03b3 in combination with IFN-\u03b2. However, recently, Paragas et al. [12] have reported that a combination of IFN-\u03b1 consensus 1 and IFN-\u03b3 did not exhibit any synergistic antiviral activity against SARS-CoV.",

Our specific goal was to determine whether combinations of both IFNs would produce enhanced antiviral effects that could, indirectly, suggest potential combination IFN therapy strategies for the treatment of SARS-CoV. The effect of combinations of both IFNs against SARS-CoV were analysed by yield reduction assay. Specifically, African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells) were seeded into 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 104 cells per well) and cultured overnight. Triplicate cell cultures were treated with concentrations (1-100,000 IU/ml) of recombinant IFN-\u03b2 (rIFN-\u03b21a, specific activity 270 MIU/mg; Rebif\u00ae, Ares-Serono, Basel, Switzerland) or natural IFN-\u03b1 (nIFN-\u03b1, leukocyte IFN, specific activity 200 MIU/mg; Alfaferone\u00ae, Alfa-Wasserman, Bologna, Italy), either alone or in combination with rIFN-\u03b3 (specific activity 20 MIU/mg; Imukin\u00ae, Boehringer Ingelheim, Reggello-Firenze, Italy) 24 h before infection with SARS-CoV [multiplicity of infection = 0.1 TCID50/cell (50% tissue culture infectious dose)]. Infection with SARS-CoV (HSR1 strain) [13] was allowed to develop for 72 h, depending on the time required for specific cytopathic effects to become clearly visible by optical microscopy [10, 13]. Culture supernatants were then collected and titration of SARS-CoV was performed in Vero cells by determination of the TCID50 using the method of Reed and Muench [14].",

Previous studies have suggested that MxA, a type-I-induced protein, is not the critical factor that mediates inhibition of SARS-CoV, despite its high-level induction by IFN-\u03b2 as well as by a mixture of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 [10, 16]. Hence, in order to discover a possible mechanism responsible for the observed synergism between type I and II IFNs, we examined the expression of two other well-known IFN-inducible proteins: 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase [17] and p56 (also known as IFIT1) [18]. The mRNA copy content of their genes was measured in untreated versus IFN-treated Vero cells by a real-time 5\u2032-exonuclease reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan\u00ae) assay using the ABI 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy). Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted from 5 \u00d7 106 Vero cells using phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent (Trizol\u00ae, Gibco BRL, Grand Island, N.Y., USA), following the manufacturer's instructions, and was transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). Next, the following primer pair and probes were added to the Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) at 300 and 100 nm, respectively, in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl: 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase [19] forward 5\u2032-TCAG-CGAGGCCAGTAATCTTG-3\u2032; reverse 5\u2032-TCAGCCA-TTGCCAGCATATTT-3\u2032; probe 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-5\u2032-TCCAGTTGACCCAACCAATAATGT-GAGTGG-3\u2032-6-carboxy-tetramethyl rhodamine (TAMRA); p56 forward 5\u2032-TGAAGAAGCTCTAGCCAACATGTC-3\u2032; reverse 5\u2032-GAGCTTTATCCACAGAGCCTTTTC-3\u2032; probe 6\u2032-FAM-5\u2032-TATGTCTTTCGATATGCAGCCAAGTTTTACCG-3\u2032-TAMRA). Co-amplification of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA housekeeping gene (TaqMan endogenous controls, No. 4333768F, Applied Biosystems) was used to normalise the amount of total RNA present. Considering that the different IFN preparations have different specific activities (IU/mg protein), Vero cells were exposed to 5 ng/ml of either IFN-\u03b1 (1,000 IU/ml), IFN-\u03b2 (1,350 IU/ml), IFN-\u03b3 (100 IU/ml) or both type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2) and IFN-\u03b3 (5 ng/ml each) for 18-20 h.",

It should be emphasised that our in vitro study has thus far been performed only in Vero cells. We were unable to obtain viral progeny from other human cell lines, including Caco and Huh7, employed by others [5, 22, 23]; thus, we were unable to assess the activity of the various IFNs in a proper human system. Further, no firm conclusions or extrapolations can be drawn from the IFN inhibitory concentration values obtained with regard to potential therapeutic concentrations of IFNs that might be expected to be required in a clinical situation. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that further investigation may be warranted to determine the role of IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2 plus IFN-\u03b3 as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of SARS-CoV infections.",
