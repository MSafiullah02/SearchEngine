            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in their most severe forms are still major challenges in modern intensive care medicine that significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients. A recent epidemiological study indicate that ALI leads to 75,000 deaths annually in the United States [1]. Respiratory failure is caused by an excessive inflammatory response to both pulmonary and extrapulmonary stimuli, including pneumonia, acid aspiration, ischemia-reperfusion and sepsis [2]. Inflammatory mediators can disrupt the pulmonary capillary barrier, leading to the influx of a protein-rich edema with severe consequences for gas exchange and the functional integrity of remote organ systems [3]. Excessive infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into the lungs has been identified as a pivotal event in the early development of ALI.",

PMVECs can be stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 to express adhesion molecules such as intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) for leukocytes and other inflammatory cells. Increased expression of adhesion molecules on PMVECs leads to leukocyte recruitment via interactions with their cognate ligands on leukocytes at the sites of atherosclerosis. PMVECs play an important role in initiation and development of pulmonary inflammation procedure as well as early target cells [4].",

Recently, it was reported that there are some active compounds in RG which could scavenge radical, inhibit the leukocytes adhesion to venular wall or protect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microcirculatory injury. As so far, among 26 identified ginsenosides, Ginsenoside-Rb1, \u2212Ro, \u2212Rg1, \u2212Rc, and -Re are highly abundant. In particular, Ginsenoside Rb1 makes up 0.37-0.5% of ginseng extracts [5]. Cell culture studies have shown that Ginsenoside Rb1 can inhibit LPS-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. We previously identified that Ginsenoside Rb1, which is isolated from Notoginseng and Ginseng in Chinese herbal medicine efficiently can attenuate LPS-induced intestinal injury by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation [6]. However, the effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 on lung microcirculatory injury has not been reported thus far.",

The present experiment demonstrate that Ginsenoside Rb1, the main ingredient of RG, may be specifically capable of attenuating the LPS-induced lung injury.",

The endothelial permeability thus increases due to the structure damage of the endothelial cells as well as to the enzymatic cleavage of adherent junction proteins [25], which eventually results in the transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelial lining into the surrounding tissues and the loss of plasma into extravascular space leading to severe hypoxemia and life-threatening edema in the lung [26,27]. The result of the present research demonstrated that treatment with Ginsenoside Rb1 reduced the accumulation of neutrophils in rat lung tissue exposed to LPS.",

            "text": "Histological examination and MPO assay in lung tissue showed more extensive neutrophil infiltration in the ALI group. Meanwhile, LPS is known to cause pulmonary inflammation in association with neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary microvasculature, followed by adhesion and activation [28,29]. We therefore studied the effects of Ginsenoside Rb1 on expression of the adhesion molecule required for neutrophil recruitment in lung tissue. Expression of ICAM-1, which is an important adhesion molecule for neutrophil activation, markedly increased in the vascular endothelium after LPS infusion [30]. The sepsis-associated organ injury is further complicated by the implication of overproduction of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8, which are believed to be pro-inflammatory factors, are produced by activated monocyte/macrophages, and acts mainly to attract neutrophils and monocytes [31]. These chemokines are all associated with the influx, accumulation and activation of highly destructive cells involved in local inflammatory processes. As Wang has reported Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced excessive accumulation of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood [32]. We have acquired the similar outcomes in this study, Ginsenoside Rb1 alleviated remarkably the overproduction of inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8). In contrast, Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly attenuated the expression of these proinflammatory molecules compared with LPS infusion alone. Thus, these findings suggest that Ginsenoside Rb1 possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties, and hence is able to suppress LPS-induced pulmonary tissue inflammation and injury. In line with these findings, the result of electron microscopy in the present study showed the gap of intercellular junctions apparently increased at 60 min after LPS infusion, whereas the endothelial cells themselves remained intact with Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment, implying that LPS-induced plasma leakage observed in the present situation was mainly inhibited by Ginsenoside Rb1.",

In this study, LPS-induced over phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 was notably suppressed by Ginsenoside Rb1, in vitro.
