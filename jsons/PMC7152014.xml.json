Ruminant neonates are born virtually without Igs and therefore the colostral Igs are essential for survival. Probably due to this unique function, Igs represent the major protein fraction of colostrum, accounting for 70\u201380% of its total protein content (Butler, 1998, Marnila and Korhonen, 2002).",

To this end, scientific and commercial attention has been focused on the development of bovine-derived Ig products that contain specific antibodies targeted for prevention or treatment of microbial infections in humans (Korhonen et al., 1998, Korhonen, 2002). Such preparations have been described as \u2018immune milk\u2019. This concept dates back to the 1950s when Petersen and Campbell first suggested that orally administered bovine colostrum from hyperimmunized cows could provide passive immune protection for humans (Campbell and Petersen, 1963). Since then, a large number of animal and human studies have been carried out to demonstrate that these preparations can be effective in the prevention or treatment of human and animal diseases caused by various pathogenic microbes (for reviews see Weiner et al., 1999, Korhonen et al., 2000a, Lilius and Marnila, 2001, Hoerr and Bostwick, 2002, Korhonen and Marnila, 2006, Mehra et al., 2006). This article reviews the current state of knowledge about the properties of bovine Igs, their utilization as ingredients for immune milk preparations, and the application of these preparations for the prevention and treatment of various microbial infections in humans.",

The molecular weight of each light chain is around 23 kDa and of the heavy chains 53 kDa. The molecular weight of the complete Ig molecule varies around 160 kDa. Both the light and heavy chains contain domains referred as constant regions (CL, CH) and variable regions (VL, VH). The light chains are attached to the heavy chains by a disulphide bond, and also the two heavy chains are held together by two disulphide bonds near a hinge region which gives the molecule structural flexibility needed in antibody\u2013antigen interactions (Nezlin, 1998a). The two identical antigen-binding sites needed in these interactions are formed by the N-terminal region of one heavy chain and the variable region of one light chain. The VL-region determines the immunological specificity. Antigen binding occurs by the interactions between the antigen and these regions. The Ig classes and subclasses are determined by the genes encoding the constant regions of heavy chains (Butler, 1998). The bovine IgG molecule occurs dominantly in two sub-classes: IgG1 and IgG2.",

This secretory IgA (SIgA) has a molecular weight of about 380 kDa, and is more resistant to proteolysis and therefore more stable in the gastrointestinal tract than antibodies without the secretory component. IgM is a circular pentamer consisting of five subunits similar to those of monomeric IgA or IgG, which are linked together in a circular mode by disulphide bonds and a J chain: the molecular weight of IgM is approximately 900 kDa (see Fig. 10.2\n).

Colostrum and human milk protect the neonate intestinal mucosa against EPEC infections by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells (Carbonare et al., 1997). This effect has been shown to be mediated by colostrum and milk SIgA (C\u00e1mara et al., 1994; Carbonare et al., 1997, Carbonare et al., 2005, Fernandes et al., 2001, Corr\u00eaa et al., 2006), and by oligosaccharides present in human milk (Cravioto et al., 1991). M-cells in intestinal epithelia have specific receptors for SIgA, and antigen-SIgA-receptor complex can be transcytosed by M-cells into lymphoid tissue for antigen presenting and induction of mucosal immune responses (Woof and Kerr, 2006).",

Many bacterial toxins must first be actively transported via receptors inside the host cells to cause cell death. Blocking the toxin may prevent its internalization in host cells. Also, Igs can inhibit or reduce the production of toxins and other harmful components by inhibiting bacterial metabolism and by blocking enzymes and receptors. This blocking may also reduce the ability of pathogens to produce structures needed in adherence to epithelia. Specific Igs can protect against viral infections by binding viruses and preventing the virus replication by blocking the receptor mediated internalisation of viruses in the host cells. Specific Igs augment the recognition and phagocytosis of antigens by leukocytes (opsonisation). Divalent or polyvalent binding of an Ig to antigenic structure results in conformational change of the Ig molecule, which process again enables the Fc portion to bind to the corresponding Fc receptors on the leukocyte surface. This receptor binding leads to various immune cell effector functions depending on the cell Ig and leukocyte type. Leukocytes are an integral part of normal milk and colostrum and are of vital importance in defending the mammary gland against pathogens (Korhonen et al., 2000b).",

These chemical methods are, however, economically not suitable for large scale-production of Igs although they yield rather pure Ig fractions. Other challenges in isolation of active Igs from colostrum has been its complex composition and the sensitivity of Igs to heat treatments. With the rapid development of new chromatographic and membrane-separation technologies in the last thirty years, it is now possible to isolate individual milk proteins on a large-scale. Based on these techniques, a great number of pilot- or industrial-scale methods have been developed and patented for fractionation and isolation of Igs from colostral or cheese whey (for reviews see Korhonen, 2004, Korhonen and Pihlanto, 2007). With these methods, the recovery rate of Igs has varied from 40% to 70% of the level present in the starting material (Elfstrand et al., 2002). Specific chromatographic techniques, such as immobilized metal chelate chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography and cation-exchange chromatography have been applied to improve the yield and purity of immunoglobulin preparations further (Fukumoto et al., 1994, Akita and Li-Chan, 1998). Microfiltration (MF) combined with ultrafiltration (UF) of bovine, equine and caprine colostrum has led to IgG/total solids purity of more than 90% (Piot et al., 2004). Using cheese whey, a 0.1 \u03bcm membrane and the concept of selective membrane separation through pH manipulation, Mehra and Kelly (2004) produced an Ig-rich preparation with a protein composition similar to that produced from colostral whey. Korhonen et al. (1998) used various MF methods, such as UF, MF and reverse osmosis, and a cation-exchange resin as a molecular sieve, to concentrate Igs from colostral whey. The Ig level of the final freeze-dried concentrates varied from 45% to 75%. Expanded Bed Adsorption Chromatography (EBAC) is a new technology which has been applied to isolate Igs from cheese whey using an adsorbent with tailored ligand chemistry (Nielsen et al., 2002). EBAC provides significant advantages over conventional packed bed column chromatography, and an Ig-purity from 50% to 70% can be achieved with this up-scalable method.",

Igs may inhibit or retard the activity of renneting enzymes of bacterial origin. In normal milk this is not noticed due to the relatively low Ig concentration but in case of mastitic milk, or if the Ig concentration of milk is increased, e.g. by adding colostrum, renneting may be retarded. The antimicrobial properties of Igs may adversely impact upon fermentation processes. A retarded fermentation by dairy starters is noted in colostrum and mastitic milk, which contain increased amounts of Igs.Also, high Ig concentrations may adversely affect the antibiotic residual tests based on microbial growth, causing false positive results (Korhonen,2004). Igs contribute to cream formation by agglutinating fat globules,which process accelerates the ascent of cream to the surface. This phenomenon is attributed primarily to IgM, which have been termed cryoglobulins or \u2018cold agglutinins\u2019. The agglutination property of Igs can, however, be inactivated by heat treatment (pasteurization) and mechanical agitation.",

In high temperature/short time (HTST) pasteurization (72 \u00b0C/15 sec) about 25\u201340% of the Ig activity is lost, whereas ultra high temperature (UHT) treatment (138 \u00b0C/4 sec) and evaporation processing destroy most of the specific immune activity of milk due to Ig denaturation (Li-Chan et al., 1995). In contrast, other studies (Mainer et al., 1997, Mainer et al., 1999) have reported that bovine milk Igs could resist the HTST pasteurization treatment without affecting their structure. Only 1% of IgG, 2% of IgA, and 14% of IgM concentrations were denatured in laboratory experiments. Also, the HTST pasteurization had little effect on the activity of bovine colostral IgG as the original rotavirus neutralizing activity was reduced by only 0.5%. In a recent study by McMartin et al. (2006), it was demonstrated that a rapid heat inactivation of IgG started at temperatures higher than 65\u00b0C, and at 81\u00b0C, as much as 90% of the virus neutralization activity of Igs was lost in less than two minutes. On the other hand, heating moderate or high quality colostrum at 60\u00b0C for at least 120 min had no effect on mean IgG concentration or titer of neutralizing antibodies against bovine viral diarrhea virus Type 1. In storage stability studies, it has been observed that bovine IgG added into UHT-treated milk retained its specific immune activity for over several months (Fukumoto et al., 1994). Also, Ig molecules seem to retain their specific activity well in milk powder, irrespective of the storage temperature (Mehra et al., 2006). Further, bacterial fermentation of milk by yoghurt or probiotic bacteria have not been found to reduce significantly the activity of colostral antibodies added in milk during a storage period of 50 days of at 4\u00b0C.

The antibody titre against certain antigenic pathogens or structure, e.g. virulence factor, can be raised up to several hundred times by immunizing the cow before parturition with vaccines containing the antigens (Korhonen et al., 1995). The resulting immune colostra and products made thereof have fundamentally different antimicrobial properties and efficacies against pathogens than normal colostrum and these two concepts have, therefore, to be differentiated. This is emphasized by the fact that the normal colostrum and preparations made from it are, in most countries, regarded as food or dietary supplement, whereas the Ig containing preparations from immunized cows are often regarded as pharmaceuticals, e.g. in the EU and USA, or their regulatory status is not defined (Scammel, 2001; Hoerr and Bostwick, 2002, Mehra et al., 2006).

Furthermore, the ingested Igs are subjected to degradation by intestinal proteases. In the stomach, the enzymatic hydrolysis by pepsin, fragments the IgG molecule to F(ab\u2032)2, Fab/c, pFc and Fv fragments (Nezlin, 1998a). In the small intestine, trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase and elastase initially degrade the antibodies to F(ab\u2032)2, Fab and Fc fragments. The secretory piece of milk SIgA protects this Ig form against digestion by proteolytic enzymes. Of the SIgA present in human colostrum, 20\u201380% passes undegraded through the gut of the human infant. Also, bovine IgG1 makes an exception since it is rather resistant to trypsin. Bovine colostrum and mastitic milk contain a compound which inhibits trypsin activity. The resulting F(ab\u2032)2 and Fab fragments retain at least part of the neutralizing and adhesion inhibiting activities in the intestine. Pacyna et al. (2001) supplemented whole milk with immune colostrum containing specific Igs against rotavirus. When 100 ml of this supplemented whole milk was administered to 105 children three times a day for six days, the anti-rotavirus Ig activity was detected by the ELISA method in 521 of 602 fecal specimens obtained during the study. Kelly et al. (1997)\ndemonstrated that 10%\u201330% of orally administered bovine anti-Clostridium difficile Ig concentrate could be recovered from the stools of human infants and adults in the form of F(ab\u2032)2 and Fab fragments.

Mitoma et al. (2002) immunized cows with a fusion protein prepared by a fusion of a saliva-binding alanine-rich region of a cell surface protein antigen (Pac) and a glucan binding domain of the glucosyltransferase-I cell surface protein from S. mutans. The immune colostrum preparation effectively prevented dental caries development in a rat model when given as concentrate once a day for 55 days, together with cariogenic diet. Shimazaki et al. (2001) examined the effect of immune colostrum containing Igs against the same fusion protein on adult subjects after an antibiotic (cetylpyridinium chloride) treatment. The immune preparation inhibited significantly recolonization of S. mutans in the saliva and plaque as compared to the control group, and the ratios of S. mutans to total streptococci in saliva and plaque were lower than in the control group. Wei et al. (2002) studied the combined effect of specific colostral Ig preparation against caries streptococci with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103 (LGG). LGG added in milk was earlier shown to reduce the risk of caries in day-care children (N\u00e4se et al., 2001). The LGG-bacteria and specific Igs in LGG-fermented milk synergistically inhibited adhesion of S. mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite particles. The Igs remained active in UHT milk and in LGG fermented milk over the whole period of expected shelf-life of these products. Thus, the rinsing with bovine immune whey indicates favourable effects on human dental plaque by controlling S. mutans in the human oral cavity and it may be beneficial to combine specific bovine milk antibodies against mutans streptococci to probiotic LGGcontaining milk products.",

The most important virulence factors are the toxins A and B, which are associated with the development of the disease. Outbreak of C. difficile infection often results from antibiotic treatments. In animal models, bovine immune colostrum preparations have been effective in the treatment of experimental C. difficile diarrhea. Van Dissel et al. (2005) used a preparation made of milk from cows immunized against C. difficile toxins and whole cell C. difficile as a supportive treatment for two weeks after a standard antibiotic treatment in an uncontrolled cohort study. Nine of 16 patients had a history of relapsing C. difficile diarrhea. After the regimen in 15 patients, the C. difficile toxins had disappeared from feces, and during the follow-up period of 11 months, none of the patients had another episode of C. difficile diarrhea. Numan et al. (2007) assessed the efficacy of C. difficile immune milk preparation in aiding the prevention of relapses in C. difficile patients. The immune milk was administered orally 5 g/day, divided into three equal doses for 14 days starting two weeks after standard treatment with oral metronidazole or vancomycin. In 109 disease episodes, 11 (about 10%) were followed by a relapse, whereas in contemporary controls the relapse rate was 20\u201325%. Young et al. (2007) evaluated the safety of the same immune milk administered to 77 C. difficile patients, similarly as in the previous study. Adverse effect monitoring, physical examinations and haematological and biochemical assessments showed no adverse effects in this group. Mattila et al. (2008) immunized cows with a whole-cell vaccine made of two toxigenic C. difficile strains and the immune whey preparation was made from the colostra of these cows. In a controlled double-blind randomized study, 18 patients with C. difficile associated diarrhea received orally 1.6 g of Ig in 200 ml volume twice per day for 2 weeks, and 20 patients received 400 mg of metronidazole twice per day. A\nC. difficile culture and toxin test was made on days 0, 14 and 28, respectively. At day 14, 100% of the metronidazole group and 83% of the immune colostrum group, respectively, responded positively to the treatment. The authors concluded that the immune colostrum treatment is somewhat less effective than the standard treatment with antibiotics but, on the other hand, it does not cause antibiotic resistance problems and does not alter the normal colonic bacterial flora as antibiotics do. In future, by optimizing the dosage, the treatment time, and the antigens used in immunizing the cows, the efficacy of bovine milk Ig preparations could be improved and this treatment strategy could also be used as a supportive treatment together with conventional antibiotics.",

This progress has facilitated and boosted manufacture of Ig concentrates as dietary supplements or ingredients. Some of these preparations are being marketed with health or nutrition function claims attached, even though the clinical evidence is limited or not reported at all. More scientific research is therefore needed in this field to substantiate the claimed health benefits. As for immune milk preparations, there are already a few commercial products on the market with quite well established clinical evidence about the efficacy. The main limitation of the clinical use of bovine milk antibodies for humans is that, as proteins of another species, the Igs can be used only orally against gastrointestinal pathogens. An interesting attempt to overcome this limitation is a transchromosomic calf that has been cloned for producing humanized polyclonal Igs. As a result of five sequential genetic modifications and seven consecutive cloning events, this calf was reported to have full human IgG 10\u201320% of total serum IgG. After hyperimmunization of this calf with an anthrax protective antigen, both full human IgG and chimeric IgG were found to be effective in a toxin-neutralization assay (Kuroiwa et al., 2009).",

In the case of diseases that can be controlled also by conventional means, e.g. dental caries, this regulatory approach has slowed down the development of immune milk preparations in many countries. However, in the case of severe diseases caused by bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics, such as C. difficile, the regulatory status of a pharmaceutical has delayed but not hampered completely the progress of such product development (Hoerr and Bostwick, 2002;\nMattila et al., 2008). Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have accepted the safety of hyperimmune milks on the basis of clinical studies that show no adverse health effects from these products (Gingerich and Mcphillips, 2005, Krissansen, 2007).",

The prevention of diarrhea would improve the nutritional status and health in general. The emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogen strains puts emphasis on the need to develop alternative ways to prevent and treat gastrointestinal infections. In developed countries, the control of gastrointestinal microbial flora has become an integral part of health promotion. It is concluded that synergistic effects of Igs with probiotics and other milk bioactives, such as lactoferrin, may open new prospects for developing novel means to prevent microbial diseases by nutritional intervention.",
