            "text": "The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.",

All of them belong to the Coronaviridae, a family of viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. Similar to other RNA viruses, this family is characterized by significant genetic variability and high recombination rate that enable them to be easily distributed among humans and animals worldwide. As a result, numerous coronaviruses exist within human and animal populations without causing life-threatening diseases. However, occasionally, the genetic recombination of viruses within random intermediate hosts produces contagious strains that are highly pathogenic to humans. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 is genetically and structurally related to SARS-CoV, it is becoming increasingly clear that it has its own unique features that contributed to the rapid spread around the globe.",

            "text": "As of April 6, 2020, a total of 1,285,257 cases of COVID-19 occurring in at least 170 countries and territories were reported, with approximately 5.4 % of fatality rate (70,344/1,285,257) . A prior overview from China that included 72,314 confirmed, suspected, and asymptomatic patients revealed several important epidemiological features of COVID-19. In general, the majority of confirmed cases are aged 30-79 years-old (86.6%) [1] . Among the 1,023 deaths, the majority were among patients of \u226560 years of age, with the \u226580 age group characterized by the highest fatality rate (20.3%) among all age groups. Ref. [1] Relatively fewer cases were reported among young children (0-9 years-old). Ref. [1] While more males were affected by the disease, the male-to-female ratio varies when focusing on different population scales (1.06:1 in China overall, 1.04:1 in Hubei province and 0.99:1 in Wuhan city). Fortunately, for the most affected patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presentation has been mild. Moreover, while this pathogen has been extraordinarily contagious, no deaths have occurred in mild or even severe cases. As to be expected, the fatality rate reached 49% among patients that were classified as critical cases.",

Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed in the human gastrointestinal epithelial cells, it is believed that the viral shedding at the gastrointestinal tract and fecal-oral transmission is highly plausible. Ref. [7] Indeed, it was reported that the rectal swabs showed positive results even after the nasopharyngeal tests were constitutively negative [8] . Besides, the live virus was also detected in stool samples of diseased patients. This evidence strongly indicate that stool can be contagious for a long time after the discharge of patients based on two negative nasopharyngeal swabs. Thus, adding rectal swabs to the discharge criteria should be considered for the prevention of both nosocomial and community spread of COVID-19.",

However, the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT are variable and nonspecific [16] [17] [18] . The most common patterns of COVID-19 on chest CT scans include multiple GGO lesions (56.4%), and bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%), and the other patterns consist of local patchy shadowing (28.1%), and interstitial abnormalities (4.4%). Severe cases tend to yield more prominent radiologic findings on chest CT scan, such as more bilateral patchy shadowing (82%), more multiple GGO lesions (60%), and more local patchy shadowing (55.1%) than non-severe cases. No CXR or chest CT abnormality was identified in 17.9% of non-severe cases and 2.9% of severe cases [1] [2] [3] . Pure GGO lesions can be found in the early stages. Focal or multifocal GGO lesions may progress into consolidation or GGO lesions with superimposed interlobular/intralobular septal thickening as crazy-paving pattern during disease progression, and the expansion of consolidation represented disease progression [19] [20] [21] . Pure consolidative lesions were relatively less common. Pulmonary cavitary lesion, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy are rarely reported [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, interestingly, it was also reported that asymptomatic patients could show early CT changes [23] . Conversely, as mentioned earlier, another study has shown positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of CT changes [24] . Despite the limited number of cases available for thorough radiographic study, we can observe the trend of varied presentations of COVID-19 pneumonia. Asymptomatic patients showing positive CT findings undoubtedly pose challenges for the current diagnostic protocol, especially those patients who have false-negative RT-PCR results.",

Typically, after the first to second week of the onset, lesions progress to bilateral diffused pattern with consolidations. By contrast, both ground-glass opacification and consolidation were present relatively early in SARS [6] . This again could be indicative of the significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity between these two diseases, especially at early or asymptomatic stage. In conclusion, correlating imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings to assess patients may be essential to facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 1 ). Whereas several human coronaviruses that cause mild respiratory diseases, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, were estimated to circulate in the human population for centuries, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were zoonotically transferred from other mammalian species in the last 20 years [12] [13] [14] [15] . Horseshoe bats are the natural reservoirs of these novel coronaviruses, and the intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to the human were identified to be the masked palm civet for SARS-CoV, and dromedary camel for MERS-CoV (Table 1 ). The recent metagenomics study has detected the most similar coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 in the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica), one of the species presumably smuggled to the Huanan wet market in Wuhan [25] .

However, there are several clinical trials on potential antiviral therapies taking place. The therapies can be divided into two categories depending on their target. One is acting on the coronavirus directly, either by inhibiting crucial viral enzyme responsible for genome replication, or by blocking viral entry to human cells. The other is designed to modulate the human immune system, either by boosting the innate response, which has a particularly important role against viruses, or by inhibiting the inflammatory processes that cause lung injury. Most of these drugs were originally designed for other pathogens and were promptly repurposed for the current COVID-19 trials. At the same time, several trials were initiated to test the specific vaccines and antibodies specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we summarize the ongoing therapeutic options that may lead us to combating the novel pathogen (Figure 2 ). Remdesivir (GS-5734) is by far the most promising drug that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activities against RNA viruses. It is a prodrug, whose structure resembles adenosine. Ref. [42] Therefore, it can incorporate into nascent viral RNA, and further inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This results in premature termination of the viral RNA chain and consequently halts the replication of the viral genome. Remdesivir was originally developed by Gilead Sciences (USA) against the Ebola virus, and has undergone clinical trial during the recent Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo [43] . Although it has not been shown to be effective against Ebola in this trial, it proved its safety for humans, which allowed it to enter clinical trials immediately in the conditions of COVID-19 emergency [43] . Importantly, it has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activities against different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in vitro and in vivo [44, 45] . In a recent in vitro study, remdesivir was also shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [46] .",

It is believed that the administration of the recombinant human Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (rhACE2) can decrease serum level of angiotensin II by directing the substrate away from the related enzyme, ACE. Like mentioned earlier, this could prevent further activation of ACE2 receptor and thereby preserve the pulmonary vascular integrity and prevent ARDS [59] . APN01, originally developed by Apeiron Biologics, has already undergone phase II trial for ARDS. A small pilot study in China (NCT04287686) is now evaluating the biological and physiological role of rhACE2 in COVID-19 pneumonia, especially as a treatment of ARDS. Later, Apeiron Biologics has initiated a placebo controlled, double blinded, dose-escalation study to access the safety and tolerability of intravenous APN01. It is believed that by measuring plasma level of angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7, the bioproducts interfered by the potential drug, the biological and physiological role of rhACE2 in COVID-19 pneumonia could be evaluated.",

Similarly, in a small open-label non-randomized clinical trial from France, hydroxychloroquine demonstrated positive effect in combination with azithromycin [62] . In the wake of this evidence, the U.S. FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in the USA. It is noteworthy that the latest study found no evidence of clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of 11 patients with severe COVID-19 [63] , thus, larger randomized controlled trials are needed for further evaluation",

The classical pathway of IL-6 signaling occurs through IL-6 receptors, which are expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and other leukocyte populations [77] . Besides binding to the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R, CD126), IL-6 can also bind to the soluble form of IL-6 receptor created by proteolytic cleavage of mIL-6R or alternative splicing of mRNA. An elevated level of circulating IL-6 is associated with a faster decline of lung elasticity and more severe bronchoalveolar inflammation. Hence, specific blockade of IL-6-regulated signaling pathways represents a promising approach to attenuate inflammation-associated damage [78] . Moreover, it is reported that in the tuberculosis model in mice, IL-6 blockade did not lead to an increase of bacterial burden in the lung. On the contrary, neutralizing TNF\u03b1 antibodies resulted in a significant increase in mycobacterial colony units.",

We also speculate on several mechanisms contributing to the novel profile of COVID-19 pneumonia, including its high transmissibility caused by unvaried ACE2 structure at the viral binding site among different populations, and its unique progression pattern, in which patients could be asymptomatic, yet presenting positive radiographic or laboratory findings.",

Most of them are based on repurposing the therapeutic agents previously designed for other applications. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. Whereas the vaccines and therapeutic antibodies aimed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 are also being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, drug repurposing happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety, and have demonstrated their action against other viruses, including the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These drugs target different viral infection response pathways, or directly interfere with the virus replication cycle as summarized in Figure 2 . As for now, some of them have already demonstrated promising results in the initial clinical trials performed in the wake of the pandemic and have been approved for a wider use.",

In the era of big data, more systematic approaches to identify the potential agents for drug repurposing can be applied. Noteworthy is the recent study by Zhou et al., whereby an integrative analysis of interactome networks associated with human coronaviruses and drugs targeting the components of these networks was applied to reveal 16 novel candidates for drug repurposing [86] .",
