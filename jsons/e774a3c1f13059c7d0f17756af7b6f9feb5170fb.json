Urinary isatin concentrations in patients with Parkinson's disease tend to increase according to the severity of disease. We have developed a rat model of Parkinson's disease induced by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The distribution of the pathological lesions of JEV-rats resemble those found in Parkinson's disease. Significant behavioral improvement was observed in JEV-rats after isatin, L-DOPA and selegiline administration using a pole test. Both isatin and selegiline prevented the decrease in striatum DA levels of JEV-rats. The increased turnover of DA (DOPAC=DA) induced by JEV was significantly inhibited by isatin, but not selegiline. These findings suggest that JEV-infected rats may serve as a model of Parkinson's disease and that exogenously administered isatin and selegiline can improve JEV-induced parkinsonism by increasing DA concentrations in the striatum.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Several previous reports have shown that stress can induce a decrease in MAO inhibitory activity (Clow et al., 1988) .

MAO inhibitory drugs such as selegiline have been widely used in clinical practice, originally for depressive illness, anxiety and for Parkinson's disease. There is, however, virtually no information regarding the detailed central nervous system (CNS) function of isatin. Some experiments suggested that isatin can serve as a marker of stress and anxiety Tozawa et al., 1998) . We previously reported that exogenously administered isatin increased dopamine (DA) levels in the rat striatum (Hamaue et al., 1999a) and recently demonstrated that a significant increase in urinary isatin excretion was present in patients with Parkinson's disease (Yahr' s classifications III, IV, V) (Hamaue et al., 2000) .

Isatin is thought to be a portion of tribulin that is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B. Other portions of tribulin, the ethyl and methyl esters of indoleacetic and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, selectively inhibit MAO-A (Medvedev et al., 1996) . Pathways for the synthesis and metabolism of isatin have not been established. One possible source would be via the action of the gut flora. It has been suggested that dietary tryptophan may be converted into indole by the gut flora and then transported to the liver where it is oxidized. Urinary isatin excretion is significantly reduced in germ free rat urine (0.22 mg=ml) compared with the urine of control rats (0.66 mg=ml) .

An inverse relationship was demonstrated between plasma NE levels and kidney MAO activity in SHRSP and WKY. Parvez and Parvez (1973) reported that catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) activity was related to the amount of substrate present in normotensive rats. It was assumed that the relative increase in red cell COMT activity was due to an increased level of circulating catecholamines. A compensatory increase in COMT and MAO activity may be an important factor in the control of plasma catecholamines in normotensive rats. In brain and kidney extracts (Hamaue et al., 1992) , tribulin-like activity was found to be significantly higher in SHRSP than in WKY. Tribulin activity was also significantly greater in the extract of SHRSP urine than in that of WKY (Hamaue et al., 1992) . It has been suggested that impairment of the central adrenergic neurons is associated with blood pressure control and MAO activity in SHRSP (Minami et al., 1988) . Thus, it is important in the regulation of monoamine concentrations (Blaschko, 1973) . Although mechanisms other than enzyme concentration have been postulated for the regulation of MAO activity in vivo, evidence of short term regulation of the enzyme is scarce. Normal human urine inhibits MAO (Glover et al., 1988) . This inhibitory activity is also present in SHRSP urine (Hamaue et al., 1992) .

It also appears to increase vigilance and reduce slow wave sleep (Chocholova and Kolinova, 1981 ), yet Yumiler (1990) found some indirect evidence to support that isatin acts as a benzodiazepine receptor blocker in vivo.

Isatin also attenuates ANP-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in the rat brain, heart and kidney (Glover et al., 1995) . Recent studies also suggest that the anxiogenic effect of isatin may be explained by its antagonism to ANP (Battacharya et al., 1996) .

Among the toxic factors, exogenous toxins such as MPTP and endogenous toxins such as free radicals or tetrahydroisoquinoline (Yoshida et al., 1990) have been implicated. Viruses can also selectively attack the substantia nigra and induce parkinsonism (Duvoisin and Yahr, 1965; Kristensson, 1992) . Post-encephalitic parkinsonism is well documented (von Economo, 1917; Yahr, 1978) . Walters (1960) described a 54-year-old woman who manifested symptoms of parkinsonism while convalescing from meningoencephalitis due to Coxsackie B virus. Influenza A virus (Hudson and Rice, 1990) , poliovirus (Bojinov, 1971) and measles virus (Alves et al., 1992) have also been suspected from case reports as possible viral causes. Fishman et al. (1980) reported an experimental model with a selective attack on the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus induced by a strain of mouse hepatitis virus which is a coronavirus that causes persistent CNS infection. Recently similar features have been described in rats infected with influenza virus (Takahashi et al., 1995) . JEV is a positive-strand enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family of the flaviviruses and is the most common cause of arthropod-borne human encephalitis worldwide. Goto (1962) detected parkinsonian sequelae in 11.6% of 143 unselected patients five years after they had Japanese encephalitis. The parkinsonian syndrome after Japanese encephalitis differs from that which follows encephalitis lethargica in several respects. In general, parkinsonism following Japanese encephalitis is mild, develops in the acute phase and occasionally improves slightly over a long period. Recently, it was reported that MRI abnormalities were seen mainly in the substantia nigra and putamen in a case of typical parkinsonism following Japanese encephalitis (Shoji et al., 1993) . Patients without a clear history of encephalitis who follow the clinical course and have pathologic findings consistent with postencephalitic parkinsonism have been reported (Gibb and Lees, 1987; Geddes et al., 1993) . Although there were no Lewy bodies found in the substantia nigra in the JEV-treated rats, the pathologic findings otherwise resembled those of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical data using anti-TH antibody suggested that the function of the dopaminergic system might have deteriorated with age in the absence of ongoing or persistent JEV infection. McGeer et al. (1988) showed that the rate of neuronal cell degeneration was considerably higher in parkinsonian patients than could be accounted for on the basis of normal agerelated neuronal degeneration alone. It seems likely that neuronal cell degeneration progressed more rapidly in the JEV-treated rats than in the controls. This observation raises the possibility that post-encephalitic parkinsonism as well as Parkinson's disease is a continuing degenerative process rather than an acute illness on which the effects of aging or decompensation are superimposed. Such late deterioration might be due to a resurgence of viral-mediated damage (Appel et al., 1992) , although our model does not support this view.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 140, "text": "(Burns et al., 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 141, "end": 166, "text": "Calne and Langston, 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 167, "end": 188, "text": "Ballard et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 189, "end": 201, "text": "Cohen, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 202, "end": 228, "text": "Nagatsu and Yoshida, 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 229, "end": 249, "text": "Dexter et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 250, "end": 272, "text": "Riederer et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 273, "end": 296, "text": "Adams and Odunze, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 424, "end": 446, "text": "(Yoshida et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 550, "end": 575, "text": "(Duvoisin and Yahr, 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 576, "end": 594, "text": "Kristensson, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 652, "end": 666, "text": "Economo, 1917;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 667, "end": 678, "text": "Yahr, 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 854, "end": 877, "text": "(Hudson and Rice, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 891, "end": 906, "text": "(Bojinov, 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 925, "end": 945, "text": "(Alves et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1036, "text": "Fishman et al.

Why neurons of the subtantia nigra remain susceptible to JEV infection longer than in other parts of the brain is unclear. One possibility is that virus receptors on the substantia nigra neurons persist longer. Certainly, the capacity of viruses to attack specific tissues selectively depends on an interaction between viral genes or proteins and host factors. An immune mechanism following an infection or other factors could be associated with the destruction of the substantia nigra.

Also, isatin or selegiline significantly increased striatum DA levels in the JEV-infected rats. Selegiline was found to be a potent inhibitor that is more active against MAO-B than MAO-A. Selegiline competitively inhibited the MAO-B activity of the rat brain in a dose-dependent manner (Tipton et al., 1976) . This drug is frequently used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Berry et al., 1994; Gerlach et al., 1996) . As a MAO-B inhibitor and a derivative of amphetamine, selegiline can alter catecholaminergic neurotransmission resulting in a neuroprotective effect (Bursey and Eichenbaum, 1996) . The dose of selegiline used in the treatment of parkinsonism (5-10 mg daily in tablet) is considered to be low enough to block MAO-B selectively while leaving MAO-A activity unaffected (Knoll, 1978) . We medicated the JEV rat with 0.2 mg=kg selegiline. Selegiline recovered movement function. The striatum DA concentrations in JEV-infected rats were increased by selegiline medication. These results suggest a high efficacy and a therapeutic role in Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, both MAO-B inhibitor isatin and selegiline prevented the decrease in striatum DA levels in JEV-rats. The increased turnover of DA (DOPAC=DA) induced by JEV was significantly inhibited by isatin, but not by selegiline. The effect of isatin on DA turnover may be one of its main roles as an endogenous MAO-B inhibitor. Hence, isatin could be a new treatment for Parkinson's disease as an endogenous MAO-B inhibitor, despite the fact that isatin is unlikely to be directly related to the etiology of Parkinson's disease
