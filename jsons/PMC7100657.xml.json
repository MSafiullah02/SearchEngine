Left ventricle (LV) status was assessed by ventricle volumes and Teicholz EF. End-systolic and -diastolic LV volumes were estimated by long- and short-axis measurements. Stroke volume was calculated as the difference between end-systolic and -diastolic LV volumes. Cardiac output was estimated by multiplying the calculated stroke volume by the heart rate. Cardiac index (CI) was obtained by dividing cardiac output by body surface area (BSA). Systolic index (SI) was obtained by dividing stroke volume by BSA.

It has been showed that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were responsible for the depression of myocardial cell contractility in vitro induced by human septic shock serum [18]. In contrast, serum from septic shock adults that induced a decrease of cardiomyocyte contractility in vitro had high levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10; however, the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were not increased [16]. IL-6 isolated from serum obtained from children with meningococcal septicemia impaired in vitro myocardial contractility [26]. TNF-\u03b1 added to IL-6 had negative inotropic activity in vitro after prolonged exposure (>48 h) [27]. Our data add to the evidence that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 are involved in myocardial contractile dysfunction associated with septic shock. Moreover, we observed greater levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 in patients with catecholamine-refractory shock, and there was an association between TNF-\u03b1 levels and mortality. In children with septic shock, serum levels of TNF and IL-10 measured at admission to the PICU were related to the severity of organ failure and mortality [13]. Taken together, these findings suggest that inflammation is associated with disease severity and outcome of children with septic shock. Interestingly, experimental studies have showed that in addition to the systemic release of cytokines, cardiomyocytes can also generate cytokines locally in the heart in response to Gram-positive sepsis and lipopolysaccharide administration, which could aggravate sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction [14, 17, 20]. However, evaluation of cytokine production by cardiomyocytes is not clinically feasible.",

In children with sepsis, flow cytometric analysis showed a greater percentage of monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells exhibiting NF-\u03baB activity compared with controls. Moreover, a positive correlation has been observed between the percentage of cells exhibiting NF-\u03baB activity and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 [15]. In contrast, NF-\u03baB activity, as evaluated by gene expression of its inhibitor, I-\u03baB\u03b1, was not associated with myocardial dysfunction or mortality in our study. In theory, I-\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA quantification would be a more accurate marker of the transcriptional strength of NF-\u03baB [5]. EMSA, which visualizes the binding of NF-\u03baB to synthetic oligonucleotides, does not necessarily reflect the transcriptional power of NF-\u03baB because it can be modified after NF-\u03baB DNA binding by phosphorylation or interaction with cofactors [5]. However, several substances can influence I-\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA levels, such as corticosteroids, which lead to increased transcription of the gene for I-\u03baB\u03b1 [2]. Because most patients (14 of 20) had received corticosteroids before entry in the study, this may have altered I-\u03baB\u03b1 gene expression.",
