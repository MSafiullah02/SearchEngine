For several decades, the most widely recognised cause of viral gastroenteritis in dogs has been canine parvovirus (CPV), but there has been a recent surge in identification of new viruses in association with canine diarrhoea. Altogether, at least seven novel viruses have been characterised from diarrhoeic faecal samples in the past few years. These are listed in Fig. 1\naccording to their viral family, alongside the four canine gastroenteric viruses identified prior to 1980: CPV, canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV), canine rotavirus and canine distemper virus.",

This was the means by which CPV and CECoV were first characterised in the 1970s (Binn et al., 1974, Thomson and Gagnon, 1978). The use of molecular methods, such as PCR, later enabled a more focussed approach to virus identification, with some canine viruses being discovered by screening for related viruses of other species. This is exemplified by the identification of canine norovirus by screening samples using a broadly reactive primer pair targeting caliciviruses (Martella et al., 2008).",

Co-infections with other viruses are common and elucidating which virus, if any, is inducing disease can be problematic. The suggestion that a newly identified virus may cause gastrointestinal pathology often comes from understanding related viruses in other species; for example, if a similar virus is known to cause gastroenteritis in humans, it may be suspected that related canine viruses will induce the same pathology in dogs. Another reason to suspect a novel virus is a cause of canine gastroenteritis typically arises from epidemiological studies. Identification of the virus in diarrhoeic samples at a significantly higher frequency than in faecal samples from healthy dogs suggests that the novel virus could be the cause of clinical disease. Nonetheless, definitive evidence that a virus can cause gastrointestinal pathology requires experimental infections. Experimental infections have confirmed that CPV, CECoV, canine rotavirus and canine distemper virus induce gastroenteritis in their hosts (Dunkin and Laidlaw, 1926, Keenan et al., 1976, Johnson et al., 1983, Meunier et al., 1985, Pratelli et al., 2004), but similar experiments are yet to be performed for the viruses discovered over the past decade.",

A single serological survey for CaAstV has so far been conducted, in which the proportion of dogs in Italy that had previously been exposed to CaAstV was studied. Canine serum samples were screened for CaAstV-specific antibodies using a single strain of CaAstV and a seroprevalence level of 59% (32/54) was detected (Martella et al., 2011). It is suspected this may be an underestimate of the total seroprevalence, since this virus is genetically diverse and it has been predicted that more than one serotype of CaAstV is circulating (Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015).",

In contrast, a study of French breeding kennels and a study of Hungarian shelter dogs found no significant association with gastroenteritis (Grellet et al., 2012, Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2016). To complicate the issue further, co-infections with other gastroenteric pathogens are common (Toffan et al., 2009, Castro et al., 2013, Caddy and Goodfellow, 2015).

Noroviruses of other animal species (bovine, porcine and murine) typically cause only mild disease unless immunocompromised animals are infected (Scipioni et al., 2008). The first CNV case exhibited signs of gastroenteritis (Martella et al., 2008), but this particular dog was co-infected with CPV and it is not possible to attribute clinical signs to CNV alone. However, CNV was detected in faecal samples for 22 days in this first reported case, indicative of active infection in the gastrointestinal tract, and CNV has been detected in association with gastroenteritis in the absence of other detectable pathogens (Martella et al., 2009). Furthermore, a Portuguese survey found the prevalence of CNV to be significantly higher in dogs with diarrhoea (40%) than in healthy controls (9%) (Mesquita et al., 2010). It is possible that CNV identification in healthy controls could represent subclinical shedding following an active clinical infection; people shed human norovirus for an average of 4 weeks after infection, although clinical signs typically resolve in a few days (Atmar et al., 2008). In summary, the evidence that CNV causes gastrointestinal disease is still limited and, to definitively confirm the pathology induced by CNV, experimental infections will be required.",

To evaluate the prevalence and association of CaSaV with disease, 200 healthy and 200 diarrhoeic dogs were screened for the virus in the initial report (Li et al., 2011). Only two positive cases were identified; one dog with diarrhoea and one without. To date, CaSaV has only been identified in one subsequent report, in which faecal samples from dogs in Japan were examined (Soma et al., 2015). The two positive cases in this study were from dogs with gastrointestinal disease, but no data on viral prevalence in healthy dogs was reported. Overall, this indicates that the prevalence of sapoviruses in the canine populations studied is low and it is not possible to speculate on disease association at present.",

This strongly suggests that CVV serosurveys are detecting antibodies to the canine-specific vesivirus. The first CVV serosurvey was conducted in Tennessee, the same state in the USA as the first identified CVV case, and 76% seropositivity was detected (Schaffer et al., 1985). A low seroprevalence to CVV was reported in UK samples tested in the same seminal study (2/25, 8%). The most recent UK study identified a comparable seroprevalence of 15/102 (15%) (Caddy et al., 2014b).

(2013a) examined histological samples from dogs with similar pathological findings and were able to identify a further three circovirus-positive cases. A single case report of canine circovirus from Italy described post-mortem identification of hepatitis and haemorrhagic mesenteric lymph nodes (Decaro et al., 2014). Moreover, the closely-related fox circovirus has been associated with meningoencephalitis (Bexton et al., 2015).
