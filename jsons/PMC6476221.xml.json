A case report is the first effort for many doctors, and other health professionals to convey a message to the entire medical profession by the means of specialized journal and remain essential to the art of medicine.[2] The purpose of the case report is to expand our knowledge on clinical manifestation, diagnostic approach, or therapeutic alternative of a disease, ultimately, to improve the quality of care provided to our patients. A case report that is worth reading should, therefore, contain both practical and educational messages.[34]",

Muslim scholars have reported case histories as well, particularly, Abu Bakr Mohamed Ibn Zakariya Al-Razi (865\u2013929 AD), where he left a large collection of case reports in his 25-volume medical encyclopedia \u201cKitab Al-Hawi.\u201d[5]",

Although case reports are considered the lowest in the hierarchy of evidence-based practice in the medical literature [Figure 1], it provides essential information for unfamiliar events and shared individual experiences, for better understanding and optimizing patient care. This approach might generate an idea or hypothesis, but it will not be confirmed unless we conduct further confirmatory quantitative experimental or observational study designs such as clinical trials or cohort studies. Despite that, case report provides the medical community with information which cannot be picked up by any other designs. Just to name a few, in 1819, James Parkinson published a case report entitled \u201cAn essay on the shaking palsy\u201d[6] and lead to the discovery of Parkinson's disease. And in 1981, a case report was published in the literature as \u201cPreliminary communication on extensively disseminated Kaposi sarcoma in a young homosexual man\u201d[7] few years later, HIV from this case report was discovered. Furthermore, in 2012, Ali Zaki reported an article in New England Journal of Medicine titled \u201cIsolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia\u201d which ultimately, lead to the discovery of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.[8] All those previous examples show how important is case report in the advancement of medical practice. The case report might be in the tail of the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine but if properly selected and appropriately reported it might stand a better chance of publication in high impact journals than even a clinical trial.",

This variation is influenced by many factors ranging from the author's knowledge base to his writing skills. The Peer review process will detect this variation to assure the quality of reporting through critical appraisal. It will assess the report, provide a valuable, supposedly constructive, feedback and helps the editor in a decision regarding the publication. This assessment should be as objective as possible to reach an unbiased decision. Therefore, several schemes were formulated to evaluate the quality of the case report. One of which is the Piersons 5-component scheme which relays on five major components, each component is scored from 0 to two, with a possible total score of 10 and lowest score of zero. The five major components are uniqueness, documentation, interpretation, objectivity, and educational value.[11] If the calculated score is more than 8, then this report is worth publishing. A score from 6 to 8, indicate possible publication with caution about validity. Any score <6, indicate the insufficient quality of the case report. Further details about this evaluation scheme are explained in Table 3.",
