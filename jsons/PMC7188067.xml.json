In New York, hospitals rapidly phased out elective surgeries, allowing for emergent cases only, and were mandated to increase their bed capacity, emphasizing ICU-level care.2,3",

This stratification limits our department\u2019s case load to spinal pathologies with acute neurologic deficit, intracranial vascular pathologies, infections, and trauma.

She was found to have bilateral subdural hematomas with significant mass effect. Before the pandemic, we would have admitted this patient for operative management without debate; in this case, due to the pervasiveness of COVID-19 in our hospital and the patient\u2019s medical history, we extensively discussed following her as an outpatient until the cases of COVID-19 decreased or her neurological condition deteriorated. She was ultimately admitted for surgery because her neurologic status deteriorated while she was at the hospital.

Additionally, with small staff pools, any staff member infected, and thus unable to perform their duties, may have a high impact on the service\u2019s ability to function. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to lay out proper protocols for protection and to be both conscientious about the safety of and cognizant of transmission by specialists throughout the hospital.",
