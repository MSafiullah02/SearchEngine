We now demonstrate in vitro that pyronaridine tetraphosphate is an inhibitor of Lysotracker accumulation in lysosomes (IC 50 = 0.56 \u03bcM). Further, we evaluated synergy between pyronaridine and artesunate (Pyramax\u00ae), which are used in combination to treat malaria. Artesunate was not found to have lysosomotropic activity in vitro and the combination effect on EBOV inhibition was shown to be additive. Pyramax\u00ae may represent a unique example of the repurposing of a combination product for another disease.",

The most recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has killed more than 2200 people (4) . Even with approval of a vaccine for prevention of EVD (5) there is still an urgent need to advance development of filovirus-specific antiviral therapeutics. A clinical trial (NCT03719586) investigated ZMapp (a monoclonal antibody cocktail) (6) ), remdesivir (a small molecule), MAb114 (a monoclonal combination) (7)) and REGN-EB3 (monoclonal antibody combination) (8) . These results showed that the antibodies REGN-EB3 and mAb114 had overall statistically similar survival rates of 71% and 66%, respectively. Unfortunately, ZMapp and remdesivir were less effective with a 51% and 47% survival rates, respectively (9) . With remdesivir showing no statistically significant clinical efficacy the search for antiviral small molecules continues.",

Previously we evaluated pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine in vitro for its anti-EBOV activity (Zaire strain) in the type I IFN-deficient Vero 76 cell line (19, 20) and no antiviral activity was observed at any concentration below the 50% cytotoxicity concentration. In HeLa cells all three drugs demonstrated selectivity (12, 14) . These observations support the hypothesis that their antiviral activity could be partially acting through or on the type I IFN-related innate immunity pathway (15) . We also tested a combination of pyronaridine with tilorone in HeLa cells and evaluated the data with the BRAID model which suggested they are likely synergistic (21) . Based on published data for tilorone and quinacrine, which are well known to be lysosomotropic agents, it was suspected that this may also be important. In addition, pyronaridine is used as an antimalarial in combination with artesunate (Pyramax\u00ae). We had previously determined that artesunate also has micromolar in vitro inhibitory activity against EBOV (22) . We now assess whether pyronaridine accumulates in lysosomes and if there is any effect with artesunate or its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin against EBOV when combined with pyronaridine in vitro. 5 ",

Each model includes several metrics to evaluate and compare predictive performance as previously described in a relevant publication (29) , including Receiver Operator Characteristic, 6 Recall, Precision, F1 Score, Cohen's Kappa (33, 34) , and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (35) . Applicability is representative of the overlap between the training and the test set. It is the quotient of the total number of ECFP6 fingerprints of the test molecule represented in the model divided by the total number of ECFP6 fingerprints of that test molecule. Generation and interpretation of prediction scores has been previously described (36, 37) . The model consisted of curated data from a key paper from Nadanaciva et al.

Pyronaridine and DHA similarly shows an additive effect in HeLa and Huh 7 cells, both with a parallel reduction in toxicity based on the BRAID analysis ( Figure S4) . A secondary analysis using Synergyfinder ( Figures S5-S6 ) also suggests that this combination indirectly potentiates pyronaridine in HeLa cells, but in Huh 7 cells these interpretations are ambiguous ( Figure S7 ).",

More recently, combinations of approved drugs found in these and other studies have suggested synergistic combinations (44) (45) (46) (47) . To date, none of these many efforts for EBOV have resulted in a clinical antiviral candidate. Several small molecule antivirals were felled at the hurdle of animal models, specifically the transition from mouse to the guinea pig model.

            "text": "Efforts to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of EBOV drug discovery have involved our efforts to identify several molecules using ML which have progressed through in vitro and in vivo testing (12-15, 17, 51) . We have also previously used these ML models to predict in vitro efficacy for drugs that were then tested against EBOV (12, 22) . The mechanism for these three compounds against EBOV is unknown. Others have demonstrated that compounds with physicochemical properties such as a basic pKa (> 6.5) and cLogP of > 2 tend to be lysosomotropic (38) and they accumulate in the lysosomes. We have now taken an ML approach to predict potential for a lysosomotropic mechanism using published in vitro data (38, 39) along with ECFP6 molecular fingerprints and a Bayesian algorithm. We have now performed several in vitro studies to validate the predictive ability of this model as well as infer the potential mechanism of one of these EBOV drugs. Pyronaridine clearly is a potent lysosomotropic agent, more so than all the other molecules tested. There is a strong correlation between published anti-EBOV activity and the lysosomotropic property (Table S2 ) for a large number of drugs. All of the compounds that were considered actives in our model were researched to identify whether they had been previously tested against EBOV and or MARV either with a psuedovirus/VLP and or a competent virus inhibition assay. 21 of 23 of these compounds had been tested previously and all inhibited these viruses, with AC 50 s almost all in the nM to low \u00b5M range. This is certainly not a comprehensive list of all lysosomotropic compounds, but this strongly supports the 1 4 notion that the lysosomotropic characteristic is directly related to the antiviral activity of the compounds within this model. Artesunate which is also similarly active against EBOV was found not to share this physiological characteristic. The initial combination of these two drugs to form Pyramax\u00ae was to avoid drug resistance of Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of Malaria and has been extensively reviewed (52) . The combinations of these two molecules are additive in inhibiting EBOV replication in vitro but with a reduced cytotoxicity as compared to the individual treatments (Figure 2 and 3). Previous work has suggested that it is possible to identify pairs of drugs that block EBOV infection in vitro via the same methodology as used here (47) This current study has implications outside of EBOV, with the increased interest in antivirals for testing against SARS-CoV-2, and in particular the heavy focus on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have shown low micromolar activity in vitro against this virus (54) (55) (56) (57) . Pyronaridine has recently also been shown to have some limited activity against SAR-CoV-2 in Vero cells (54) , but Vero cells may not be as appropriate as human cells to test compounds such as pyronaridine (low in vitro selectivity index, but high in vivo antiviral activity). Based on our previous findings, this leaves the distinct possibility that there has been an underestimate of pyronaridine's 1 5 antiviral inhibition potential. Our current data also suggests that we should be testing artesunate versus additional viruses as well as in combination with pyronaridine.",
