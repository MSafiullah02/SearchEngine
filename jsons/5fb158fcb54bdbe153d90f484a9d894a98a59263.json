For example, in previous work performed in the animal shelter used in the study described here, Giardia spp. were detected in approximately 10% of the healthy dogs tested (M.R. Lappin, unpublished data, 2010) . Enteric coronaviruses also have the potential to cause diarrhea. These viruses colonize many cats that enter animal shelters or humane societies and are often acquired while the cats are housed in the facility. For example, when cats in a California animal shelter were tested for coronaviruses in feces on entry and on day 7, the prevalence rates were 33% and 60%, respectively. 1 In a different study of cats housed in the animal shelter used in the current study, coronavirus RNA was amplified from 31.8% of cat feces collected on entry. a Clostridium perfringens is a bacterium harbored in the gastrointestinal tract of many dogs and cats that has the capability to produce enterotoxins and cause diarrhea. In a different study of cats housed in the animal shelter used in the current study, C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in the feces of 18.2% of the cats on entry. a In addition, this organism was cultured from feces of 58.5% of client-owned dogs in the city where the current study was performed and from 36% of dogs housed in a French animal shelter. 2, 3 Each of these organisms can be harbored by healthy animals and then have clinical illness exacerbated by stress, diet change, or other immune-suppressive events.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 397, "text": "Lappin, unpublished data, 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 780, "end": 781, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1471, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1473, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Regardless of the cause, presence of diarrhea in cats or dogs housed in animal shelters can delay the adoption process, drain limited shelter resources, and in extreme cases, result in euthanasia of the animal.

The majority of cats in the stray room had behavioral evidence of domestication and the majority of the cats in the feral room did not.

In addition, the differences in the parasite prevalence rates (23.1% in the feral room; 9.2% in the stray room; P 5 .0066) emphasize the differences in case management before entering the shelter. However, we believe that by dividing the study into 2 periods where the SF68 supplemented room and placebo supplemented rooms were switched and inclusion of the parasitism rates in the analysis should have adequately accounted for these variables. Although no studies have been done to demonstrate the stability or sensitivity of SF68 in the environment after gastrointestinal transit, the cages were cleaned and disinfected daily and so the 7-day period should have been adequate to allow any residual organism to die.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the dogs, statistical differences were not noted but this may have merely related to the low number of dogs that had diarrhea for !2 days over the course of the study (1 in each group). As stress diarrhea is common in dogs that are boarded, this finding was unexpected. The median duration of stay for the SF68 and placebo groups was 2 and 3 days, respectively. Therefore, the opportunity to detect diarrhea that continued for !2 days in the dog population was low. The shelter staff was also requested to collect all abnormal feces (FS!4) from any animal included in this study because the dogs defecated at irregular times during the day. As there were several shelter employees that cleaned the runs during a 24-hour period, it is possible that some diarrhea samples were discarded unintentionally. Other reasons for this low occurrence of diarrhea are purely speculative. It is possible that stress to dogs housed in these 2 rooms was minimal as there are only 14 runs per room and the runs are large. The shelter staff anecdotally believes that the dog diarrhea rate in the study period was lower than in previous years. The major change compared with previous years is that in this study, a consistent ration was fed. In previous years, food donations from multiple sources were used and so the dog rooms were rarely fed the same diet consistently and some diets donated may have been of low quality. A larger study in dogs will be required to further evaluate for effects of SF68 on diarrhea rates in shelters or other stressful environments. There have been several other studies of SF68 administration to dogs or cats housed in research facilities that suggested this probiotic has potential immune-enhancing effects. In 1 study, puppies fed SF68 were compared with a placebo group and were shown to have statistically greater total plasma IgA concentrations (P .05), numerically greater fecal IgA concentrations (P 5 .056), and increased canine distemper virus-specific plasma IgG and IgA concentrations over time after vaccination. 10 Healthy cats fed SF68 had greater CD41 lymphocytes counts compared with cats fed a placebo on week 22 of the study. 11 Lastly, cats with chronic feline herpesvirus-1 infection fed SF68 had less conjunctivitis over time than cats fed a placebo. 9 However, in each of these studies, the positive effects were only evident after long-term supplementation of the probiotic. The maximum amount of time an individual cat in the study described herein was fed the probiotic was 6 days.
