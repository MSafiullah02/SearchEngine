[1] [2] [3] [4] An online survey that used snowball sampling techniques and collected data from 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China in January-February 2020 found that over 50% rated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as moderate or severe.",

            "text": "Symptoms of anxiety were rated as the most common psychological problem. Self-reported poor physical health status and the presence of a chronic illness were associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. 4 A recent \"rapid review\" of evidence published in February 2020 identified 24 studies that Compared to COVID-19, these outbreaks were much more limited in scope. Pre-quarantine characteristics associated with less favourable psychological status among adults under quarantine included history of mental illness, young age, less education, female sex, and number of children, although results were not consistent across studies. Factors during quarantine associated with worse outcomes included the duration of quarantine, access to supplies and information, financial resources, fear of infection and complications, degree of social isolation, and boredom. 2 No randomised controlled trial (RCT), however, has tested an intervention to improve mental health symptoms from quarantine. [1] [2] [3] Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. [5] [6] [7] Onset typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and approximately 80% of people with SSc are women. 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SSc can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Common manifestations include Raynaud's phenomenon, skin thickening, dyspnea and cough, gastroesophageal reflux and other gastrointestinal symptoms. [5] [6] [7] Disease presentation is extremely heterogeneous, and the course of the disease is highly unpredictable. [5] [6] [7] People with SSc commonly experience diminished hand function and mobility limitations, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, pruritus, symptoms of depression, and body image distress from disfiguring aspects (e.g., skin tightening, pigment changes, hand contractures, telangiectasias). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Many people with SSc are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (> 40% have interstitial lung disease) 14 and common use of immunosuppressant drugs. 15 Although recommendations differ across the world, most countries have advised that people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as SSc, engage in strict isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Items are scored on a 5-point scale (range 1-5), and response options include \"never\", \"rarely\", \"sometimes\", \"often\", and \"always\". 72 : The full MSBS 81 is a 29-item measure of state boredom with items on five factors that load onto a single higher-order factor. 72 The 8-item MSBS is a short version with scores that correlate very closely to scores from the full MSBS (r = 0.96). 82 Item responses are on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and assess the degree to which each item reflects the respondant's experience currently. Total scores range from 8 to 56 with higher scores reflecting greater boredom. The MSBS-8 was translated into French by the SPIN Team using a well-accepted forward-backward translation method. 83 Physical activity (IPAQ-E) 73 : The 4-item IPAQ-E is a short-form version of the full IPAQ 84 designed to assess physical activity over the last week, including time spent sitting, walking, and in moderate and vigorous physical activity. 73 Compared to other short-form versions of the IPAQ, the IPAQ-E has examples of exercise specific to older adults. The full IPAQ has excellent reliability and moderate validity across many different countries, 84 This may be a conservative power and sample size estimate. First, in cluster RCTs, ICC values for individual patient outcomes are typically lower than our 0.05 estimate. [88] [89] [90] If the true ICC is lower than our 0.05 estimate, this will result in greater power than estimated.

Depression symptoms (PHQ-8) 69 : PHQ-8 items measure depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) with higher scores (range 0 to 24) indicating more depressive symptoms. The PHQ-8 performs equivalently to the PHQ-9, 74 which is a valid measure of depressive symptoms in patients with SSc. 75 The PHQ-8 is available in French and English. 76 Stress (PSS) 70 : The 10-item PSS measures the degree that respondents appraise their lives as stressful; items are designed to reflect the degree that they find their life circumstances in the last 4 weeks to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, or overloaded. Items are scored on a 5point scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total scores (range 0 to 40) are computed by summing individual items scores, and higher scores reflect greater perceived stress. The PSS has been validated in many medical and non-medical populations, 77 including in French. 78Loneliness (ULS-6) 71 : The 6-item ULS-6 is a short version of the 20-item ULS, which is designed to assess subjective feelings of loneliness and social isolation.71 Respondents indicate the degree to which feelings described in each item apply to them. Items are scored on a 4point scale from 0 (never) to 3 (often); total scores range from 0 to 18.
