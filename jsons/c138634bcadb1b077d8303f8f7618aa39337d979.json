All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition the prevalence of respiratory virus infections and the viral month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respira-genotypes circulating throughout Indonesia. The absence tory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza of this information is a barrier to the development of ap propriate public health interventions, including immuni zation policies and health protection measures. Respira tory virus incidence and prevalence data throughout Indonesia are also very limited and have not been well doc umented. Only a few reports are available [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] that dem onstrate the presence of influenza viruses in patient popu lations randomly selected from various studies. The pre sentation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been reported in children [7-10] but not in adults. There is no information about the presentation of other respiratory vi ruses, including their seasonal epidemic patterns and their association with specific clinical findings. Prevalence in formation is also required to direct approaches for secur ing appropriate clinical services for infected patients. Moreover, there are few data about respiratory viral infec tions in adults with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia, because most studies have been performed in children. The preva lence, clinical profile, and epidemiology of respiratory vi ruses in adults are different from those in young people [11] . Additionally, the relationship between the geograph ical distribution, season, and respiratory virus species is not fully understood in adults. Consequently, there is a clear need to further study the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults with ARI. Based on these conditions, a cross-sectional study of adults with influenza-like illness (ILI), ARI, or severe ARI (SARI) was performed at the Dr. Moewardi General Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Surakar ta, Central Java, Indonesia, to determine the prevalence of a select group of human respiratory viruses, including the influenza A virus, the influenza A H1 virus, the influenza A H3 virus, the influenza A H5 virus, the influenza B virus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4, RSV A, RSV B, human rhinovirus (HRV), entero virus (EV), human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and adenovirus. This study aimed to describe the viral genotypes, evaluate the epidemic season ality, and determine whether specific characteristics were associated with these infections. The clinical presentation and coinfection with torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV) were also investigated.",

The nucleic acids were then aliquoted, and one aliquot was reverse-transcribed using a Superscript III First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit with random hexamers (Invitrogen). All DNA and cDNA were used immediately for nested multiplex PCR for 19 respiratory viruses as described previously [14] . Briefly, each nested multiplex PCR assay detected several pathogens: group 1 contained influenza A-and B-specific primers and subtype H1N1-, H3N2-, and H5N1-specific primers; group 2 contained primers for the parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4a, and PIV 4b); group 3 contained primers for RSV A, RSV B, HRV, and EV; group 4 contained primers for HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HMPV, and group 5 contained primers for HBoV, ad enovirus 1, adenovirus 2, adenovirus 3, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Molecular detection was per formed by PCR using a AmpliTaq Gold \u00ae 360 DNA Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen). Internal amplification controls were included in each molecular assay to exclude false-negative results. The correspond ing positive controls and one negative control (sterile water) sam ple were included for each group simultaneously. To prevent PCR contamination, the reagent preparation, sample processing, and nested PCR assays were performed in rooms separate from where the amplified products were analyzed. Aerosol-resistant pipette tips were used throughout the assays. The PCR products were sub jected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet illumination. All sam ples were tested at least twice.",

TTV may disrupt the mucociliary escala tor, similar to other respiratory viruses [35] ; however, its pathological mechanism remains poorly understood. In the present study, the detection of TTV was associated with ARI and hospitalization and, intriguingly, all TTVpositive ARI patients were hospitalized. Single infections with TTV were not detected in nasal and throat samples from patients with exacerbations of asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. In addition, single infections with TTV were not detected in nasal and throat samples from pa tients with pneumonia. However, 8 pneumonia samples were positive for coinfection with TTV and a respiratory virus. We also found that coinfection with TTV and a hu man respiratory virus was associated with the incidence of ARI. Additional studies are warranted to further inves tigate the association of age with the contribution of TTV to viral respiratory diseases, especially when coinfected with a respiratory virus.",

Moreover, prior to this study, there were only limited data about the molecular epidemiology profiles of respi References ratory viruses in Indonesia, and none of the data were derived from adult patients with ARI. HMPV, HRV, ad enovirus, HCoV-OC43, and HPIV-3 were also detected for the first time in Indonesia. However, our study had several limitations. We only tested for specific acute up per respiratory infection etiologies, including common human respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria; this limitation reflects a limited budget for etiological diag nosis, which is a common situation in hospitals in devel oping countries. The data collection was also limited to one tertiary hospital over a 1-year period due to the lim ited budget; therefore, the seasonal patterns for the vi ruses were derived from one season, and the number of study patients may have been insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Additional surveillance studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to confirm and extend our findings.",
