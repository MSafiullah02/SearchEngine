Their main tasks will be\n\u25e6 to provide an overarching perspective to One Health and Global Health Security and as such connect both worlds.\u25e6 to help predict potential biological events that could impact public health security in the future and to detect gaps in research in the fields of zoonoses, emerging infectious diseases and AMR, including the ecological and environmental factors which impact on these diseases.Establishing a focused scientific agenda on OHS and on AMR as a framework of the 6th World One Health Congress, June 2020, Edinburgh and engage the broader scientific community and the public health and global health security communities.The need for increased connections between One Health Science and Global Health Security and thus more attention for One Health Science with an impact on Global Health Security in governments and international institutions and subsequently increased inter-sectoral collaboration.Further discussion and work on \u201cpeace time\u201d preparedness elements: syndrome surveillance in humans and animals, pathogen discovery (identification platforms for humans and animals), diagnostic development and distribution platforms, mathematical modelling, animal models, pathogenesis study platforms for new infections, preventive intervention platforms, therapeutic discovery platforms and communication strategies.The need for the establishment of a network of spokespersons on science-related vaccine issues that unites vaccination advocates worldwide",

It is relevant to note that SARS, as the first novel pandemic threat of the new millennium, has clearly demonstrated that previously unknown pathogens can emerge from a wildlife source at any time in any place and without warning, threaten the health, well-being and economies of all societies. There was a clear need for countries to have the capability and capacity to maintain an effective alert and response system to detect and quickly react to outbreaks of international concern, and to share information about such outbreaks rapidly and transparently. Responding to pandemic threats requires global cooperation and global participation. Combined with the growing globalization of health risks and the importance of the human-animal-ecosystem interface in the evolution and emergence of pathogens, the best solution appears to be a One Health approach.",

Since 1970, new infectious diseases of humans have been discovered at an average rate of 1 every 8 months. Influenza pandemics are an economic issue: the World Bank has suggested that a low level pandemic could globally reduce production by almost 1% of gross domestic product, a moderate pandemic by almost 2% and a serious pandemic by as much as 5%, which would result in a serious economic recession. Zoonotic diseases that start to spread among humans are also a societal issue: SARS in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 have shown how quickly panic, stigmatization and mistrust towards governments and the scientific community can arise (even during clearly moderate epidemics). Effects may be long-lasting and have long-term consequences for populations\u2019 support of health measures. This emphasizes the important role of communication in health issues. Zoonotic diseases have security implications: 80% of known biological weapons have a zoonotic origin. Antimicrobial resistance develops and spreads at the animal human interface and is a major challenge to the future health of mankind. According to the World Bank the cumulative impacts by 2050 are $100 trillion and 10 million human deaths annually. Agriculture and aquaculture contribute to direct transmission of resistant strains and AMR dispersion, reduced efficacy threatens both health and food production.",

The possibility to combine data from a wide range of applications and domains changes how problems can be framed and how potential solution pathways can be identified and applied.

This has led to a series of large-scale outbreaks causing high mortality, morbidity and significant economic shocks (e.g. the West African Ebola virus outbreak) leading to mobilization of significant resources in response. Analysis of global trends in EIDs suggest that they are increasing in a non-linear manner and that their economic impact is increasing exponentially [2]. Thus, new strategies to deal with their underlying drivers would be more cost-effective as a strategy to combat this rise in pandemic risk.",

The OIE, jointly with FAO, has implemented a post rinderpest eradication strategy which has led to the sequestration and destruction of rinderpest virus material to avoid a laboratory accident or deliberate release; approval of several safe and secure rinderpest holding facilities to store remaining stocks of virus; and a ban on research involving the handling or manipulation of rinderpest virus, unless approved by OIE and FAO. The OIE has also worked on strengthening surveillance networks that can detect the possibility of deliberate release of biological agents (as well as natural disease outbreaks) and has developed guidance for its member countries on how to investigate suspicious animal or health events which might indicate some nefarious activity. This also involves engaging with the law enforcement sector.",

In that way, we aim to make science evolve, thus improving health and security. There is a clear need for the identification and prioritization of research gaps in the fields of zoonoses, emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance, including the ecological and environmental factors which impact on these diseases, and advocate the resulting scientific research agenda - both at the scientific and the policy level. We need to create synergies and facilitate the sharing of data between researchers and research groups in order to mend the prioritized research gaps and translate these novel data to anyone who might benefit from them.",
