These experiments showed that footpad inoculation of HEV in 4\u2010week\u2010old rats consistently resulted in the ipsilateral infection of DRG (\u223cL4\u2013L6) and spinal motoneurons at lumbar levels at day 3 p.i. and in the contralateral infection of layer V of the hind limb area in the primary motor cortex at day 4 p.i. Infected rats showed a relatively constant onset of encephalomyelitis, with an average survival of about 6 days. Fatal infection with HEV can be protected against by cutting the proximal segment of the sciatic nerve within 1 hour after inoculation (Hirano et al.,1995). Moreover, no anterograde propagation of HEV has been found along spinal ascending pathways throughout the periods examined (Bai et al.,2006; unpublished data). Consistent with the results in the previous experiments, the present study showed that at day 4 p.i. HEV\u2010positive cells were observed in only a certain population of neurons with different sizes in layer V of the primary motor cortex (Fig. 1A,B). The fluorescence signals for HEV showed a punctate pattern and were located in the cell bodies and the primary dendrites of pyramidal cells (Fig. 1C). By contrast, less intense staining was also seen in the putative axons (arrows in Fig. 1C).",

Under EM, intracellular virus was identified as spherical particles inside vesicles or as electron\u2010dense materials in the process of budding into the intracellular membranous cisternae, as reported previously (Clarke and McFerran,1971; Mengeling et al.,1972; Yagami et al.,1986). Enveloped virus particles were spherical, with an electron\u2010lucent or \u2010dense center, and the outer surfaces of the viral envelopes were often covered by a layer of well\u2010defined projections, forming a typical \u201ccorona\u201d profile (Fig. 2F1,2).

Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus\u20101 and pseudorabies virus, also exploit exocytosis for egress from the host neuronal cells, but their subsequent entry into the synapse\u2010linked neurons occurs exclusively by fusion of the virus envelope with the axonal membrane (Card et al.,1993; Diefenbach et al.,2008). Because of the direct penetration by fusion of herpesviruses, only virus nucleocapsids can gain access to the axoplasm (Dolivo et al.,1978; Marchand and Schwab,1986; Card et al.,1993). On the other hand, rhabodoviruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and rabiesvirus, are released from the host neuronal cells by directly budding from the membrane of the neurons and subsequently endocytosed within vesicles by adjacent axonal terminals (Iwasaki and Clark,1975; Dal Canto et al.,1976; Charlton and Casey,1979; Superti et al.,1987; Lewis and Lents,1998; Sun et al.,2005).",

J shows a virus\u2010containing coated vesicle (arrow) in the motoneurons attaching to the membrane. Virus particles without any vesicular structures are found extracellularly in the synaptic cleft. m, Neuronal cell body; t, axonal terminal. In L, coated vesicles (arrowheads) containing virus particles are seen both in the neuronal cytoplasm (m) and in an adjacent axonal terminal (t). In addition, many virions are accumulated in the dilated synaptic clefts, and some of them are seen trapped in the coated invaginations (arrows) of the axonal membrane. Scale bars = 200 nm in H (applies to A\u2013H); 400 nm in inset H (applies to insets A\u2013H); 1 \u03bcm in I,K; 100 nm in J,L.",

HEV is retrogradely transported inside vesicular structures by microtubules along the axon into the neuronal cell body (boxed area b in A, enlarged in B).

The progeny virions were released from the host cells by fusion of the coated vesicles with the plasma membrane and subsequently taken up by the next\u2010order neurons by way of the membranous\u2010coating\u2010mediated endocytosis (boxed area d in A, enlarged in D).
