The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.",

HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 strains of coronavirus cause mild respiratory diseases in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family that can infect human and several animal species . The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus and mostly resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% sequence homology (Chan et al., 2020a) . Currently, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced to human by an unidentified intermediary animal and then it has spread from human-to-human.",

The Coronavirus Study Group of the International J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the new pathogen as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya, 2020) . The predecessor SARS-CoV first emerged in 2002. During its course of infection from 2002 to 2003, 774 deaths were recorded out of the 8000+ infections spread across 37 countries (Peiris et al., 2004) . This was closely followed by the emergence of MERS-CoV at Saudi Arabia in 2012, which caused 858 deaths among the 2494 known infected cases (Zaki et al., 2012) . Similar to its antecedents, the SARS-CoV-2 appeared in December 2019 from the animal kingdom and spread to human populations. The COVID-19 is known to show symptoms slowly over an incubation period of around 2 weeks. During this time the virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract, forming lesions (Chan et al., 2020b) . The general symptoms observed in the infected individuals are fever, cough, dyspnoea and lesion in the lungs . In the advanced stage, the symptoms of this virus show pneumonia which progresses to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which results in to the need for life-support to sustain the patient's life (Heymann and Shindo, 2020) .",

An illustration about the structure and binding of S protein to ACE2 has been depicted (Fig.1) . The simplest and most direct approach to combat SARS-CoV-2 would be to neutralize the virus from entering cells as this has been utilized in previous viruses of its kind (Walker and Burton, 2018) . The key advantage here is the host ACE2 protein does not change, so there is no fear about advantageous mutations that may hinder drug development (Karakus et al., 2020) .

The viral RNA replication is the most unusual and critical step carried out by the virus for its survival inside the host body. The tools that are required for the process of replication are open reading frames (ORFs), two replicase genes (rep1a and rep1ab), a slippery sequence (5'-UUUAAAC-3') and two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Both these polyproteins contain the most important proteins of the virus that are the Nsp proteins (Nsp1-11and Nsp1-16), these proteins are a common occurrence in these virus types (Baranov et al., 2005) . Recently, it has been found that, the Nsp 15 protein not only has a vital role in replication but also attacks the immune system of the host during viral replication (Youngchang et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020). Further these Nsp proteins (Nsp1/2, Nsp2/3 and Nsp3/4) assemble to form the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) which creates an environment inside the host body suitable for RNA synthesis and replication. Also, these Nsps have various roles in RNA replication of the virus. Nsp12 codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domain, Nsp13 is encrypted with RNA helicase domain and RNA 5'-triphosphase, Nsp14 encodes exoribonuclease (ExoN) which helps in replication conformity and finally Nsp16 encodes 2'-Omethyltransferase activity. These evidences prove that Nsp protein has a vital role in keeping the virus alive inside the host body by promoting basic synthesis, replication and translation.",

These changes found in SARS-CoV-2 include, an absent 8a, longer 8b and shorter 3b segments and different Nsp 2 and 3 proteins . Nsp 2 of SARS-CoV-2 consists of mutation that is probably associated with the ability of the virus to be more contagious (Angeletti et al., 2020) . In addition, the orf8 and orf10 proteins are also different in SARS-CoV-2. It may be beneficial to understand the biological function of these proteins. Further, it has been found that more pathogenic viruses contain a furin like cleavage site in the S protein, which is not present in SARS-CoV but present in the SARS-CoV-2 (Coutard et al., 2020) . This may be the reason for increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 binds the same receptor as SARS-CoV, namely, ACE2 with much higher strength; this could be the reason for the increased transmission rate and its capacity to affect other species with such ease. The S protein has S1 on its N terminal and S2 at its C terminal, and the RBD is present at the S1 region. The S2 domain of the S protein consists of the fusion protein, a second proteolytic site (S2\u2032), followed by an internal fusion peptide (FP) and two heptad-repeat domains preceding the transmembrane domain (TM) and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f internal FP is identical between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Coutard et al., 2020) .",

This cleavage induces a conformational change that activates S2, this is followed by the insertion of the FP into the membrane and membrane fusion occurs facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. Since the nucleotides are conserved in RBD binding motif that is associated with ACE2, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same mechanism as well. Once the virus enters the cell, ACE2 gets cleaved and shed by ADAM17 into the extra membrane space. Reduced ACE2 has been known to be concomitant with alveoli injury and increases pulmonary vascular permeability (Li and Clercq, 2020) . This could be due to the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE2, which is a negative regulator of the reninangiotensin pathway. Angiotensin II stimulated ATIR results in the lung pathology associated with respiratory distress (Li and Clercq, 2020) . Once the virus translates its proteins in the cell, the ORF3a protein is produced and codes for a Ca 2+ ion channel that is similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It interacts with TRAF3 and activates the transcription of the NF-kB pathway, resulting in the transcription of the pro-IL-1B J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f protein also activates the inflammasome pathway through NLRP3, and this protein is longer in SARS-CoV-2 . The extra nucleotides present in this virus need to be further studied to figure out if that has caused an added advantage. The E protein forming an ion channel, is also conserved in the two viruses and is involved in the overproduction of cytokines through the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . All these pathways combined together cause a cytokine storm resulting in respiratory distress a common symptom of COVID-19. Another pathway involved in SARS-CoV includes the JNK pathway; which is activated by ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF7a which may lead to an increased production of pro-inflammatory factors, escalating lung damage (Liu et al., 2014) . The JNK pathway can also be considered as a target for SARS-CoV-2 as it also involves the proteins that are analogous in both viruses.",

The first coronavirus found to invade the porcine brain was HEV 67N, and it shares >91% homology with HCoV-OC43 (Li et al., 2016) .

Although, useful at that time, it is now essential to develop specific tests for COVID-19. The viral nucleic acid detection is primarily used in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis . CDC has recommended the collection of upper respiratory nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for the diagnostic tests (CDC, 2020) . The CDC detection assay targets the N region and consists of one test for beta-coronaviruses and two unique probes for SARS-CoV-2. The Charit\u00e9 algorithm comprises of probes for E protein and RA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Once both are positive, the sample is again tested against specific SARS-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f CoV-2 RdRp (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) . Contrastingly, the E protein with RdRp was also detecting SARS-CoV, and so, these assays can be used to test for the SARS-CoV-2 when there are no traces of SARS-CoV (Cordes and Heim, 2020) . When the commercially available Real Star kit, Virus +Rox Vial kit and Super Script III Onestep RT-PCR System with Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase were compared for their efficiency, the RealStar Kit did not have any unwanted signals and exceeded the other two in its performance (Konrad et al., 2020) . These methods can also be compromised due to inadequate sample volume, inaccuracies in methods of testing, not collecting samples at the appropriate time window, and contamination. Similar issues have been identified as potential problems that may diminish the precision of the tests (Lippi et al., 2020) . Moreover, these tests are also expensive, hence cheaper alternatives have been developed to track the symptoms of COVID-19 using smart-phone surveillance (Dorigatti et al., 2020) . Imaging techniques can also be utilized as a diagnostic method in COVID-19. Additionally, chest CT scans have been facilitated to detect lung abnormalities in this SARS-CoV-2 infection .",

Clitoria ternatea has been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f identified as a metalloproteinase inhibitor, ADAM17, a metalloproteinase that is involved in ACE shredding can be targeted using this plant, as ACE-2 shredding has been associated with an increased formation of viruses (Maity et al., 2012) . The plants Glycyrrhiza glabra (Nourazarian, 2015) and Allium sativum (Keyaerts et al., 2007) have been known to target the viral replication of SARS-CoV, arising as promising candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Clerodendrum inerme Gaertn , another herb has been found to have the potential to inactivate the viral ribosome, this can be further investigated for its utility as a drug targeting SARS-CoV-2 protein translation (Olivieri et al., 1996) . Similarly, Strobilanthes Cusia (Tsai et al., 2020) Verbascum thapsus reduced infections caused by influenza viruses. The molecular mechanism by which these plants target influenza virus can be studied to understand if they attack any molecules overlapping between SARS-CoV-2 and the Influenza viruses. Hyoscyamus niger was found to be a bronchodilator and also had inhibitory effects on Ca 2+ channel (Gilani et al., 2008) . This could be used to target the orf3a Ca 2+ channels that trigger various downstream pathways upon viral infection. Most importantly, various medicinal plants have shown inhibitory effects against ACE, and these include Coriandrum sativum (Hussain et al., 2018) (Yarnell, 2018; Arora et al., 2011; Coon and Ernst, 2004) .

Upon binding, the virus fuses with the membrane and enters the cell, followed by translation, and replication of the proteins. ORF3a, ORF8b,E proteins and the NF-KB pathway activates the inflammasome pathway through various means, leading to the activation of cytokine.

Its not yet clear how SARS-CoV-2 affects the immune system. During viral infection, host factors elicits immune response against the viruses. T cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ play a significant antiviral role to combat the pathogens and elevate the risk of developing autoimmunity/inflammation (Cecere et al., 2012). The CD4+T cells advance the production of viral-specific antibodies by activating T cell-dependent B cells. However, CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic and kill virus infected cells. The CD8+ T cells account for about 80% of total inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium in SARS-CoV infected patients and play a critical role in clearing coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune injury (Maloir et al., 2018). In addition, T helper cells make proinflammatory cytokines via NF-kB signaling (Manni et al., 2014). The cytokines, IL-17 recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the infection site showing inflammation and activates other downstream cascades of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-\u03b2, and MCP-1(Bunte and Beikler, 2019). It was observed that, T cell apoptosis was induced by a novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV protein mediated by Bcl-xL (Yang et al., 2005). From the experimental evidences it was shown that T cell response to S protein and other structural proteins (including the M and N proteins) is long-lasting, persistent and provides evidence for designing new drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 composed of viral structural proteins, which can induce dominant, effective, and long-term memory cell responses against the virus. However, earlier studies have also reported a crucial role of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (Chen et al., 2010), while Janice et al. (2012) also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4+ T helper cells. Moreover,",

The antiviral effects of medicinal plants have played a tremendous role at different stages of viral growth(Akram et al., 2018). Plant derived pharmacological formulations marked a major contribution for viral infections(Cragg et al., 1997).Based on the availability of suitable, efficient and rapid bioassay systems, the antiviral compounds have been used for rapid screening from plant extracts and fractions(Scior et al., 2012). Instead of synthetic antiviral drugs, medicinal plants deliver basic raw materials for important antiviral drugs(Moghadamtousi et al., 2015). Synthetic drugs have been replaced by medicinal plants, as life-saving drugs(Gurib-Fakim, 2006) in various viral diseases. Unfortunately, the usage of these J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f medication have been passed down to generations by word of mouth and most of them have been lost over time, due to the lack of proper documentation. Research on these herbs and medicinal plants may help to promote their usage in clinical settings to prevent or treat various illnesses.
