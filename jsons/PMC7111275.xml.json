De Clercq in 1986 of broad-spectrum antiviral activity of (S)-HPMPA [9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine] and PMEA [9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine] led to a new family of nucleotides designated as acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANP) [1], [2], [3], [4],. ANPs are nucleotide analogs that are characterized by the presence of a phosphonate group linked to a pyrimidine or purine base through an aliphatic linker. Three of these are approved drugs for the treatment of severe/fatal infectious diseases and represent three different types of ANPs: (i) HPMP derivatives such as (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine (HPMPC, cidofovir (Vistide\u00ae)] which is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients [5]; (ii) PME derivatives such as PMEA [adefovir (in its oral prodrug form, adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera\u00ae)] for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections [6], and (iii) PMP derivatives such as PMPA [tenofovir (in its oral prodrug form, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread\u00ae)] is used for the treatment of HIV infections (AIDS) and hepatitis B virus [7]. From these data, it appears that small chemical alterations in the acyclic side-chain lead to marked differences in antiviral activity and the spectrum of activity of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates against various classes of viral agents [1].",

In our search for antiviral compounds, we synthesized a new class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates based on a 4-phosphono-but-2-en-1-yl base motif in which the oxygen heteroatom has been replaced with a double bond having trans stereochemistry [8]. We have shown that this modification allows mimicry of the three-dimensional geometry provided by the backbone of PMEA, PMPA, and CDV while maintaining an electronic contribution similar to that brought by the oxygen atom [8]. Several new derivatives are efficiently activated by human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK), and the best substrates were converted to bis-(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester phosphonate prodrugs and found to be active against several herpes viruses in cell culture.",

[17], [18] have demonstrated good activity in various RNA viral infections. In a first attempt, we struggled to introduce the pyrazine moiety through direct N-alkylation of 10 with the corresponding (E)-4-phosphono-but-2\u2032-en-1\u2032-yl bromide (9), in the presence of K2CO3 in anhydrous DMF, (Pathway A). Unfortunately only the bis(POM)-but-1,3-dienyl phosphonate 9\u2032 resulting from undesired bromine elimination was obtained, (Scheme 3\n). Thus, we decided to reach the pyrazine phosphonate analogs 13, 14 following the same strategy developed for the cytosine derivatives, (Pathway B). Starting from the 3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide 10, the N\n1-Crotyl-3-oxo-pyrazine-N\n3-bis-Boc-carboxamide 11 was obtained in 49% yield, via the two step crotylation/N-Boc-protection. Next, N\n1-crotyl-3-oxo-pyrazine-N\n3-bis-(Boc)-carboxamide 11 in CH2Cl2 was treated in the presence of bis(POM)-allylphosphonate 1 and (NHC)RuCHR Nolan's catalyst 3 to give the desired product 12 in 22% yield. To obtain the carboxamide 14, we first applied our previous described methods, using ceric ammonium nitrate and CH3CN\u2013MeOH (1:1). Surprisingly, the methylester 13 was isolated as the major compound in 47% yield. Thinking that the presence of the undesired product 13 was due to the use of methanol as co-solvent, the preparation of the desired amide 14, was achieved in CH3CN using ceric ammonium nitrate in 25% yield.",

Starting from 15, the protection of both nitrogens provided compound 16, in quantitative yield, which is directly used in the next step. An attempt to selectively Boc deprotect at the N\n1 position of 16 to 17 failed and gave the unexpected free amide derivative 18. Alternatively, we decided to successively alkylate the N\n1 position of the 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide in the presence of crotyl bromide and Cs2CO3, followed by the protection of the free nitrogen in dry THF in the presence of Boc2O and DMAP at room temperature to give the desired triazole 19 in 34% in two steps (Scheme 4\n). N\n1-crotyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-bis-Boc-carboxamide 19 was then subjected to the olefin cross metathesis reaction, with bis(POM)-allylphosphonate in CH2Cl2 to obtain the desired compound 20 in 16% yield. The bis-Boc groups were cleaved according to the previous procedure, by treatment with CAN in a mixture of CH3CN\u2013MeOH (1:1) to give the free ANP analog 21 in 42% yield (Scheme 4).",

The introduction of the azide group could be easily performed from the key intermediate previously described. The olefin cross metathesis of bis(POM)-allylphosphonate with (E)-1,4-dibromobut-2-ene catalyzed by catalyst 3 afforded (E)-4-bromo-bis(POM)-allylphosphonate (9) in 88% yield. Then, the introduction of azido on 9 with sodium azide in DMSO\u2013THF\u2013H2O (5:2:1) afforded (E)-4-azide-bis(POM)-allylphosphonate 22 in 69% yield (Scheme 5\n). Among the modifications on the base moiety, carboxylic acid is an unavoidable function. In a first attempt, following our previously described method C, in the presence of propiolic acid under microwave irradiation, we observed the formation and isolation of the unexpected decarboxylated product 23 in 16% yield [25], [26]. To circumvent this decarboxylation, Hall et al. reported boronic acid catalysis (BAC) for the activation of carboxylic acids, to lead to a classic dipolar [3 + 2] cycloaddition with several azides [27]. To obtain the desired (E)-4-(4-carboxylic acid-[1,2,3]-triazol-1-yl)methyl-bis(POM)-but-2-enylphosphonate derivative 24, we selected the BAC of the azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition, which was converted in 58% yield in the presence of 2-nitrophenylboronic acid at room temperature.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, \u2026 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque (VZV) formation by 50%. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105 cells/cm3) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds.

Following five days incubation (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2), total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy96 well extraction kit from Qiagen. Replicon RNA and an internal control (TaqMan rRNA control reagents, Applied Biosystems) were amplified in a single step multiplex Real Time RT-PCR Assay. The antiviral effectiveness of the compounds was calculated by subtracting the threshold RT-PCR cycle of the test compound from the threshold RT-PCR cycle of the no-drug control (\u0394CtHCV). A \u0394Ct of 3.3 equals a 1-log reduction (equal to 90% less starting material) in Replicon RNA levels. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was also calculated by using the \u0394Ct rRNA values. RS-446 (2\u2032-C-Me-C) was used as the control and tested at 10 \u03bcM. To determine EC50 and EC90 values [31], \u0394Ct values were first converted into fraction of starting material and then were used to calculate the % inhibition.",
