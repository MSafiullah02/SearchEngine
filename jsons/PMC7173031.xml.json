Quasispecies was developed as a general theory to understand the dynamics of the first replicative molecules in the context of the origin of information and early evolution of life.4 Quasispecies dynamics, characterized by a continuous process of mutant generation, competition and selection, has also provided an interpretation of the great adaptive potential of pathogenic RNA viruses, and has evidenced the need to use combination antiviral therapies and to design polyvalent antiviral vaccines for the control of viral disease (review by Domingo et al.3). An understanding of quasispecies dynamics has opened new antiviral strategies through virus entry into error catastrophe, also termed lethal mutagenesis (review by Eigen5).",

            "text": "HIV-1 is a human retroviral pathogen whose populations participate of quasispecies dynamics10 (review by Crandall11) and that includes two disparate phases in its replication cycle.12 As integrated proviruses, cDNA copies of HIV-1 RNA replicate as cellular genes, with the high fidelity copying inherent to cellular DNA polymerases endowed with proofreading-repair activities and subjected also to post-replicative repair pathways.13 Upon expression from integrated sites, viral RNAs are processed to direct the synthesis of multiple proteins to culminate in the formation of retroviral particles whose first replicative step upon entering a new host cell is the error-prone copying of genomic RNA into DNA by the retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT).12 This replication cycle favours the existence of a second type of genetic memory in HIV-1 which differs from the replicative memory described for FMDV, a picornavirus whose RNA replication cycle does not include a DNA step. Integrated DNA copies of the HIV-1 genome constitute a reservoir of viral sequences that upon cellular activation can contribute new mutant distributions to the replicating pool of the virus.11., 12. Several anatomical compartments (including lymph nodes) and cell types (resting CD4+ lymphocytes, macrophages, and others) are potential reservoirs for HIV-1.14., 15., 16. Viruses in reservoirs can evolve more slowly than those circulating in the plasma of the same patient, and they can maintain for months or years the genotype exhibited when they entered the reservoir. This genotype can be either wild-type or drug-resistant, independent of the genotype currently dominant in the plasma.17., 18. Integrated proviruses are not affected by the selective pressure of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI), whilst their expression, following activation of the host lymphocyte, may be sensitive to protease inhibitors (PRI).11., 12. Also, some anatomical sites may provide a barrier to the antiretroviral pressure, due to limited access of some drugs (i.e. PRI).17., 18. Viruses from such reservoirs could re-emerge and occupy the circulating quasispecies as documented by phylogenetic analyses of consensus sequences.19 Re-emergence could be a consequence of structured treatment interruptions.20., 21., 22.\nFigure 1\nshows a flux diagram of HIV-1 infection that takes into account the different cellular types that contribute to (and can represent sources of) memory in the circulating HIV-1 quasispecies (quantitative data23., 24., 25., 26., 27., 28.). Here we provide direct experimental evidence of the occurrence of memory in HIV-1 quasispecies, and we present a mathematical model to distinguish replicative memory from transiently non-replicative (or reservoir) memory operative in HIV-1. We discuss the implications of the two types of memory for retrovirus adaptation.",

The possible contribution of non-replicative (reservoir) memory was studied by means of sequence analysis of retrospective viral samples from two patients (cases 1 and 2). Consensus nucleotide sequences were used to deduce the amino acid substitutions present at each codon of the protease (PR) and the first 220 codons of the RT (Table 2). Sequential HIV-1 sequences from case 1 showed a progressive accumulation of resistance mutations after a five year exposure to AZT (in monotherapy from April 1992 to December 1995, and in combination with ddI until May 1997). This accumulation of nucleoside-resistance mutations (Table 2) led to selection of multinucleoside-resistant genomes encoding the insertion T69SSS in sample 5.97. The shift to a HAART combination (d4T+3TC+RTV) resulted in the absence of this insert-containing genotype in a sample collected only two months later. Interestingly, this sample (7.97) and the following one (3.98) exhibited a mutation pattern in the RT very close to that of the first available sample of this patient (11.94). HIV-1 proviral DNA collected in August 1998 conserved some of the mutations found in the RT-coding region prior to May 1997. The re-emergence of the initial genotype is not evident for the consensus sequence of the PR-coding region, although a shift to a consensus sequence lacking the key substitutions N37S and R41K was observed in sample 7.97 (Table 2). The different behaviour of the RT and PR genes could be due to the absence of a selective pressure acting on the PR, resulting in their independent evolution, or to intra-patient recombination events. Different phylogenetic approaches were used to analyse consecutive consensus sequences in order to evaluate the possibility of a re-emergence of viruses that could have been hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments from November 1994 until July 1997. NJ, UPGMA, MP and ML methods produced the same overall tree topology for consensus sequences of pol and env regions (Figure 2(a) and (b)). The phylogenetic relationships are highly consistent and show a clear separation between two groups of isolates: 7.95/12.95/9.96/5.97/8.98-DNA (genomes with a progressive accumulation of nucleoside analog-resistance mutations, and the proviral sequence), and 11.94/7.97/3.98 (the ancestral genome and those present after its re-emergence).",

            "text": "Case 2 was a patient with a poor adherence to treatment, who showed large fluctuations in viral load as a response to different HAART regimes during the period of study (Table 1). After the interruption of a regime composed of ddI+d4T+RTV+SQV in September 1997, large fluctuations both in viral load and mutational pattern were recorded in consensus sequences from October 1997 to September 1998 (Table 1, Table 2). The amino acid substitutions in PR and RT suggested the occurrence of two progressive re-emergence events. Sample 8.98 would be the result of the re-emergence of viruses related to those in sample 10.97 (with some definitory amino acid replacements, such as V32I and V82A in the PR, and K70R and K122E in the RT), and sample 9.98 would result from the re-emergence of sequences from sample 1.98 (with signature substitutions L10I, I62V, G73S, I84V and L90M at the PR, and M41L and L210W at the RT). Most of these amino acid replacements are related to drug resistance to PRI or RTI.29., 30. A phylogenetic analysis of the sequential consensus sequences using MP, NJ, UPGMA and ML indicated isomorphic topologies for pol and env in all cases (Figure 2(c) and (d)). The phylogenies show a clear clustering of samples 10.97/8.98 distant from the cluster formed by samples 1.98/9.98/1.99, consistent with a double process of re-emergence of genomes hidden in reservoirs.",

To evaluate the possible presence of replicative memory in HIV-1, a detailed phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequential clonal sequences from case 3. In this patient, key mutations in HIV-1 related to decreased sensitivity to inhibitors were maintained at all time points, yet dominance of genomes encoding the RT insertion T69SSS was lost within a six month interval (from January to June 1995), probably as a result of the switch from AZT+ddC treatment to ddI monotherapy. The re-introduction of AZT (in combination with 3TC) was associated with selection (from June to August 1995) of a virus whose consensus sequence contained the RT insert (Table 2). MP analysis of 693 bp long sequences of 120 molecular clones spanning the PR-coding region and the first 130 codons of RT for six sequential samples (Table 1) using HIV-1 CAM-1 as the reference sequence showed a separation (statistically supported by bootstrap re-sampling) between sequences harbouring the dipeptide insertion (either Ser-Ser or Ser-Gly) and those without any RT insertion (Figure 3). Sample 2, which as sample 1 had a consensus sequence with T69SSS RT (Table 2), contained one clone (2-17) without insertion, which clustered with all clones (except three) from sample 3. Conversely, sample 3, with a consensus sequence without RT insertion (Table 2), harboured three clones (3-3, 3-5 and 3-8) with a T69SSS genotype. These minority sequences from sample 3 clustered with all the insert-containing sequences from samples 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, minority genomes without insertion were present in populations dominated by insertion-coding genomes, and, conversely, minority insertion-coding genomes were present in populations dominated by viruses devoid of the insertion. These results suggest the presence of a replicative memory in HIV-1 quasispecies.",

We introduce the quality factor q\nj (q\nj\u2208[0,1]): the fraction of faithful copies of j; the rest, 1\u2212q\nj, are mutants from j to other components k. The constant rate of mutation from j to k is termed \u03bckj. We assume \u03bckj to be a constant \u03bckj=\u03bc, with \u03bc in the range from 10\u22125 to 10\u22123. The differential equation satisfied by n\nj(t), assuming a constant population size and no degradation, is:4., 31., 32.\n(1)dnj(t)dt=(kjqj\u2212k\u0304(t))nj(t)+\u2211k\u2260j\u03bcjknk(t)where \u2211j=13nj(t)=\u03ba is the total population size, k\u0304(t)=\u2211j=13kjnj(t)/\u03ba, and the rates of reproduction, quality factors, and mutation rates are not independent quantities, but are related by the identity:(2)kj(1\u2212qj)=\u2211k\u2260j\u03bckjIn the case of three viral species, and from equality (2), we have:(3)dn1(t)dt=(k1\u22122\u03bc\u2212k\u0304(t))n1(t)+\u03bcn2(t)+\u03bcn3(t)\n(4)dn2(t)dt=(k2\u22122\u03bc\u2212k\u0304(t))n2(t)+\u03bcn1(t)+\u03bcn3(t)\n(5)dn3(t)dt=(k3\u22122\u03bc\u2212k\u0304(t))n3(t)+\u03bcn1(t)+\u03bcn2(t)where:k\u0304(t)=k1n1(t)+k2n2(t)+k3n3(t)n1(t)+n2(t)+n3(t)In the case of only two species contributing to the quasispecies, the equations are slightly different, and condition (2) implies:(6)dn1(t)dt=k1\u2212\u03bc\u2212k1n1(t)+k2n2(t)n1(t)+n2(t)n1(t)+\u03bcn2(t)\n(7)dn2(t)dt=k2\u2212\u03bc\u2212k1n1(t)+k2n2(t)n1(t)+n2(t)n2(t)+\u03bcn1(t)The system of equation (1) can be written in a more compact form: \u1e45=Mn\u2212k\u03041n, where the dot means a time derivative, and we have introduced the matrix M. We are interested in the steady-state quasispecies solution.31 A solution is provided by diagonalizing the matrix M, which means finding a diagonal matrix \u03bb and a non-singular matrix O, such that \u03bb=OMO\n\u22121 and M=O\n\u22121\u03bbO. If the quasispecies is made up of N different components, the late time limit of n\nj(t), which we denote by n\u0304j, is given by:(8)limt\u2192+\u221enj(t)\u2211i=1Nni(t)\u2261n\u0304j\u2211i=1Nn\u0304i=Oj1\u22121\u2211i=1NOi1\u22121where we have assumed that component 1 of the quasispecies is fitter than the rest N\u22121 (k\n1>k\nj>0). The columns of the matrix O\n\u22121 correspond to the components of the eigenvectors of M. Therefore, the computation of the relative fractions (given by equation (8)) requires only the largest eigenvalue \u03bb1 and its corresponding eigenvector v\u03021, which is the first column of the matrix O\n\u22121.",

We start at time t\n0 with only viral components 1 and 2 present, at arbitrary initial conditions n\n1(t\n0) and n\n2(t\n0), respectively (the late time limit does not depend on the initial conditions). Rates of reproduction are k\n1=1.0>k\n2 (all values of k\ni are relative to the highest one, which is always considered as k=1.0). From time t\n0 to time t\n1 we let the system evolve, and assume that t\n1 is sufficiently late so that n1(t1)=n\u03041 and n2(t1)=n\u03042 are the quasispecies values for the corresponding choice of parameters k\n1 and k\n2, respectively. The evolution from t\n1 to t\n2 is characterized by n\u03041 and n\u03042. At a later time t\n2 the system is exposed to a selective pressure, with component 1 being affected and component 2 not affected. In the particular case of dynamics of HIV-1 in vivo such selective pressure can be identified with an antiviral treatment, so that 1 is sensitive to the treatment, whereas 2 is resistant. This corresponds to the situation k\n2=1.0>k\n1. After a short period \u03b4, that is, at t\n2+\u03b4, the selective pressure is withdrawn, expecting to recover k\n1=1.0>k\n2, with k\n2 at t\n2+\u03b4 being larger than the initial k\n2 value at t\n0, which means that component 2 has become fitter. With these new values for k\n1 and k\n2 we let the system evolve to a sufficient late time t\n3. At t\n3, n\n1(t\n3) and n\n2(t\n3) have reached their new quasispecies values (as the value of the constants has changed). In particular, n\u03041(t3)<n\u03041(t1) and n\u03042(t3)>n\u03042(t1). The value n\u03042(t3)/\u03ba corresponds to the level of \u201cmolecular\u201d or replicative memory of component 2. The evolution from t\n3 to t\n4 is characterized by these quasispecies values. At a later time t\n4 we apply a second selective pressure (a different antiviral treatment), which favours a new component 3 to move from a reservoir to the bloodstream (thus the circulating quasispecies includes now three components). We assume that component 1 is sensitive to the treatment, components 2 and 3 are resistant, and 3 is fitter than 2 (this is the reason why component 3 has moved from a reservoir compartment to the bloodstream), so k\n3=1.0>k\n2>k\n1. If this second treatment is maintained after t\n4, component 3 will remain the majority in the quasispecies, and will be recognized as the consensus sequence. This corresponds to the situation reported for cases 1 and 2, where the re-emergence of ancestral \u201ccomponent 3\u201d genomes was detected as the consensus sequence, following a long dominance of \u201ccomponent 1\u201d genomes. If we discontinue this second treatment at a time t\n4+\u03b4, the system will recover the fitness ratio k\n1=1.0>k\n3>k\n2 and, at a later time t\n5, sufficient for the system to reach its steady-state, we will obtain new quasispecies values for this set of parameters: n\u03041(t5),\nn\u03042(t5) and n\u03043(t5). The quasispecies level n\u03043(t5)/\u03ba would correspond to the contribution of non-replicative (or reservoir) components to the quasispecies memory.",

In the present study we have used such procedures to provide evidence for the presence of memory in HIV-1 quasispecies from three patients subjected to successions of well defined selective antiviral pressures. Case 1 documented the re-emergence of viral genomes that could have been hidden in cellular or anatomical body compartments for 32 months. These memory viruses lacked all the nucleoside resistance mutations, including the insertion T69SSS, that had progressively accumulated in the circulating quasispecies. The introduction of a potent HAART regime (d4T+3TC+RTV) would have eliminated most of the circulating viruses while ancestral, probably fitter, viruses would have moved from the reservoirs to the bloodstream. A previous clonal analysis51 did not provide evidence that minority members of the replicating quasispecies survived the treatment, although such minority could have been below the detection level of the analysis. Case 2 revealed that re-emergence of viral genomes can occur in two consecutive rounds, as a result of treatment interruption or incomplete adherence. In case 3, MP analysis of molecular clones indicated that minority genomes without an RT insertion in sample 2 (5% of the total quasispecies) became majority (85%) in sample 3, probably due to their higher fitness after six months in the absence of AZT+ddC therapy and in the presence of ddI. Minority genomes that maintained the T69SSS genotype in sample 3 (15% of the total quasispecies) were likely selected by the re-introduction of AZT (together with 3TC) and restored a quasispecies dominated by viruses with the RT insertion in sample 4 (collected two months after sample 3; Table 1). The inserts in RT were probably maintained during the rest of the infection due to the multi-nucleoside resistance they confer to HIV-1.57., 58., 59., 60. Therefore, minority components of the mutant spectra of a HIV-1 quasispecies can be maintained in memory as a record of the previous evolutionary history, and can become dominant when the same (or a similar) selective pressure that originated them is reintroduced. The case analysed here has shown the presence of minority memory genomes in samples 2 and 3 that then originated the majority of mutant spectrum in samples 3 and 4, respectively.",

The presence of memory HIV-1 genomes, harbouring constellations of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors different from those mutations present in dominant genomes, confer the virus a selective advantage to respond more rapidly whenever a change in treatment is implemented. Probably, inhibitor-based environmental fluctuations favoured the identification of the two kinds of memory genomes in the cases studied. However, it must be considered that other environmental fluctuations (either internal, due to physiological alterations, or external, such as treatment interruptions) may also favour memory genomes as selective reservoirs to gain dominance in the replicating pool of viruses.",

It is based on the theory of quasispecies, and considers a three-component model in which the third component comes from a latent reservoir after activation by a biological stimulus (opportunistic pathogen or other). The distinction between the contributions of both memory sources is not obvious, because the irruption of a third (non-replicative) component from the latent reservoir may resemble the rise of a replicative minority genome to participate in the multi-component dynamics of the circulating HIV-1 quasispecies. The numerical solution of the time evolution of the system of equations (involving the three components) has shown that both replicative and non-replicative memory produce minority genomes in the steady- state, which to a first approximation (due to the small value of \u03bc when compared to k\nj) are proportional to \u03bc (for \u03bc=10\u22123, they are 1.02\u00d710\u22123 and 1.17\u00d710\u22123, respectively; Figure 4).

However, other RNA viruses (several picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, etc.) may target different organs and cell subsets providing a complex mosaic of quasispecies distributions. Our model will apply whenever slower replicating mutant distributions can increase their replication rate (for example, as a result of immune-escape or local physiological alterations that increase permissivity to viral replication) and enter into competition with other mutant distributions. Additional studies on quasispecies memory of non-retroviral RNA viruses in vivo are needed before applicability of the model presented here can be assessed.",

Groups of clones with identical sequences are labelled as sample-letter-number: the letter is consecutive for each group in one sample and the number indicates how many identical clones belong to that group. Sample 1 (February 1994) showed four groups of identical sequences: 1-A5 (clones 1-1, 1-4, 1-7, 1-14 and 1-16), 1-B3 (1-3, 1-9 and 1-12), 1-C3 (1-8, 1-18 and 1-19) and 1-D2 (1-13 and 1-15). Samples 2 (January 1995) and 3 (June 1995) had all their clonal sequences different from each other. Sample 4 (August 1995) showed five groups of identical sequences: 4-A3 (4-2, 4-6 and 4-20), 4-B2 (4-4 and 4-12), 4-C2 (4-7 and 4-16), 4-D2 (4-8 and 4-9) and 4-E3 (4-10, 4-14 and 4-15). Sample 5 (September 1995) had three groups of identical sequences: 5-A2 (5-4 and 5-12), 5-B2 (5-7 and 5-20) and 5-C2 (5-14 and 5-18). Sample 6 (May 1996) showed one group of identical sequences: 6-A2 (6-4 and 6-5). Therefore, the 120 clones were represented by 100 different sequences in the clustering. Five defective clones detected in sample 5 were 5-2, 5-9, 5-11 and those in group 5-C2. Colour code: blue, sequences with the RT insertion T69SSS; green, sequences with the RT insertion T69SSG; red, sequences without RT insertions.
