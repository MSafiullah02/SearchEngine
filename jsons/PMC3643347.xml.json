            "text": "In recent years the use and the overuse of antibiotics to treat Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs) has resulted in the development of resistance patterns across widespread areas. Most URTIs are self-limiting viral infections due to rhinovirus, para-influenza virus, corona virus and adenovirus and resolve without prescription drugs. There is sufficient evidence to support the viral origin of most of these illnesses. However, even some of the bacterial illnesses are also self-limiting and antibiotic treatment is unnecessary. Acute bacterial sinusitis develops in 0.5-2% of cases of viral URTI. Recognizing viral or bacterial diseases (for which specific therapy is available) is important. Therapy addressing specific symptoms is the mainstay for most URTIs (viral). Antibiotics have no role in the management of common cold or any mild URTI except when it is due to bacterial infections like streptococcal pharyngitis, bacterial sinusitis, epiglottitis, pertussis or diphtheria.[1]",

The study was conducted retrospectively in a north Indian city in 200 patients visiting a dental clinic, who could provide information about the medicines used, in the previous episodes of URTI. The data was collected on a questionnaire performed by the investigator, by interviewing the patients on antibiotic usage in URTI on a non-prescription basis, for a recall period of six months. Data on the source of information for the patient about the drug, awareness about the cost difference of generic or branded drugs, dose and duration of the drug for which it was taken and any adverse effect experienced with its use, were also collected.",
