In pregnant queens, viraemia usually leads to embryonic death, stillbirth or viraemic kittens, which will fade rapidly. In latently infected queens, virus is usually not transmitted to the fetuses, but single kittens in a litter may become viraemic after birth. 9 In these cases, transmission has taken place from individual mammary glands, where sequestered virus remains latent until the mammary gland develops during the last period of pregnancy.",

Once the rapidly dividing bone marrow cells become infected, virions are produced at high rates and viraemia develops within a few weeks. Often viraemia develops several months after constant exposure to shedding cats. 11 It eventually leads to infection of the salivary glands and intestinal linings, and virus is then shed in large quantities in saliva and faeces. 12 A functioning immune system will frequently control both the development and maintenance of viraemia, which then is termed 'transient'. These 'regressor' cats are generally not at risk of developing disease. In a multi-cat household in which there is no control of FeLV infection, 30-40% of the cats will become persistently viraemic, 30-40% will exhibit transient viraemia, and 20-30% will seroconvert without ever having been detectably viraemic. About 5% will follow an atypical course of infection, with antigenaemia but no viraemia. 11 A cat that has overcome viraemia remains latently infected; infectious virus can be recovered from some provirus-positive cells (eg, when bone marrow cells are kept in culture for several weeks). 14 This virus reactivation also takes place in vivo, when latently infected cats experience immune suppression or chronic stress. 15 It is not clear how often this happens, but it is believed to be rare.",

The risk of such latent persistence leading to eventual FeLV re-excretion and/or development of disease must be extremely low, since recovered cats have the same life expectancy as naive cats. Local foci of infection or latent virus may also be the source of p27-antigenaemia in cats from which infectious virus cannot be isolated -the so-called 'discordant' cats. 37 The clinical signs of FeLV infection usually develop in viraemic cats, sometimes after several years of viraemia. 8",

Courtesy of Tadeusz Frymus Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a process of clinical decision-making that allows clinicians to find, appraise and integrate the current best evidence with individual clinical expertise, client wishes and patient needs (see Editorial on page 529 of this special issue, doi:10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.001). This article uses EBM ranking to grade the level of evidence of statements in relevant sections on clinical signs, diagnosis, disease management and control, as well as vaccination. Statements are graded on a scale of I to IV as follows: \u271c EBM grade I This is the best evidence, comprising data obtained from properly designed, randomised controlled clinical trials in the target species (in this context cats); \u271c EBM grade II Data obtained from properly designed, randomised controlled studies in the target species with spontaneous disease in an experimental setting; \u271c EBM grade III Data based on non-randomised clinical trials, multiple case series, other experimental studies, and dramatic results from uncontrolled studies; \u271c EBM grade IV Expert opinion, case reports, studies in other species, pathophysiological justification. If no grade is specified, the EBM level is grade IV. Further reading Roudebush P, Allen TA, Dodd CE, Novotny BJ. Application of evidence-based medicine to veterinary clinical nutrition.

Inactivated vaccines are recommended \u271c Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive or bone marrowsuppressive drugs should be avoided. \u271c All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. \u271c All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure (outdoor access, FeLV-endemic area) should be vaccinated against FeLV.\u271c Kittens should be vaccinated at 8-9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later.",

As the immune response in immunocompromised cats is decreased, more frequent boosters may be considered (in asymptomatic cats). The vaccination of FeLV-positive cats against FeLV is of no benefit whatsoever. \u271c Cats with chronic disease Acutely ill cats should not be vaccinated, but those with chronic illness such as renal disease, diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism should be vaccinated regularly if they are at risk of infection. \u271c Cats receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs Vaccination should be considered carefully in cats receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. Depending on the dosage and duration of treatment, corticosteroids may suppress the immune response, particularly its cell-mediated arm. The use of corticosteroids at the time of vaccination should be avoided. Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) affects cats worldwide. Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has dropped considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for identifying viraemic carriers and to vaccines.",
