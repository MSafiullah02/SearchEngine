Such systems generate recommendations so as to encourage safety throughout the entire process, from blood donation through monitoring of recipients. Several directives from the European Union relate to the regulation, monitoring and safety of blood products, with the haemovigilance component helping to direct member nations\u2019 reporting of serious transfusion\u2010related adverse reactions and events 3. Therefore, haemovigilance systems are widespread in European nations, with prime examples being the United Kingdom with its voluntary Serious Hazards of Transfusion reporting system (99\u00b75% participation in 2013) 4, and the Netherlands with its Transfusion and Transplantation Reactions in Patients haemovigilance programme (98% participation in 2013) 5.",

In the USA, TACO was the only event in which reporting was performed for components combined (RBCs, platelets, plasma). In secondary analyses, adverse event rates from active surveillance in the USA were compared with the rates generated from the passive haemovigilance programme; in these instances, the rates were given using several denominators (per patient, per unit and per transfusion\u2010related hospital stay).",

Countries that reported zero events were included and, in such instances, a one\u2010sided exact Poisson 97\u00b75% confidence interval was used for the country\u2010specific rate. Heterogeneity was assessed using a gamma density function (shape parameter = 2, scale = 0\u00b75) for the variance of the random intercept (between\u2010country variance) in the Poisson model. This Rate Index of Heterogeneity (RIH) is unit\u2010independent, encompasses a range from 0% to 100% heterogeneity and is directly derived from the underlying random\u2010effects Poisson model for assessment of rates.

Moreover, in some countries such as New Zealand, both non\u2010severe and severe allergic reactions are reported17 (perhaps reflecting their higher rates as shown in Fig. 1) while in the USA, reporting of non\u2010severe allergic reactions is not required 48. Other reasons for differences in rates may be variations in hospital\u2010specific reporting practices and the mandatory/voluntary nature of the reporting.",

Rate differences may be a reflection of the resources afforded for testing of alloantibodies and the feasibility of longitudinal observation. Information regarding follow\u2010up procedures or standardization of procedures would enhance the interpretability of rates. Alternatively, haemovigilance programmes may reconsider the usefulness of expending resources to capture such data when the likelihood of consistent, meaningful information is low. Perhaps periodic systematic testing in high users of transfusion would be more appropriate such as in patients with sickle\u2010cell disease or cancer, or in participants of cardiovascular disease registries.",

The requirements include the demonstration of the pathogen in the transfused component, or in the donor at the time of donation, or in an additional component from the same donation, or in an additional recipient of a component from the same donation 48. Also required is documentation that there are no other potential exposures to the pathogen that could be identified in the recipient and either evidence that the recipient was not infected with the pathogen prior to transfusion or evidence that the pathogen strains are related by molecular or extended phenotypic comparison testing 48. This is a difficult target to reach when such in\u2010depth testing is not usually conducted with each transfusion. Therefore, the pooled rate of transfusion\u2010transmitted bacterial sepsis was very low (0\u00b783/1 million RBC units). There are few published reports of prospective surveillance for comparison purposes. Barrett and colleagues51 found a bacterial contamination rate of 3\u00b72/100 000 RBC units, while Dzieczkowski and colleagues37 reported this rate to be 14\u00b71/100 000 RBC units.

Likewise, electronic capture of pre\u2010 and post\u2010transfusion blood pressures could assist the detection of hypotensive reactions. Some have already merged records from transfusion and apheresis medicine with the main electronic medical record 53, 54, 55. The SCANDAT2 is a successful example of linked donor and recipient health information in Sweden and Denmark 55.
