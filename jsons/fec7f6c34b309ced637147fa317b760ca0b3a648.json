Generally speaking, the S glycoprotein facilitates viral binding to susceptible cells, causes cell fusion, and induces neutralizing antibodies. Of the 2 functional subunits containing several antigenic sites, S1 and S2, the S1 monoclonal antibody appears to occur most efficiently because it has a higher level of neutralizing activity [14, 15, 16] .",

The M proteins from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, MHV, FCoV, IBV, TGEV, and BCoV are targeted to the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus. Reverse genetic studies and virus-like protein (VLP) assembly studies suggest that the M protein encourages assembly by interacting with the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and S glycoproteins at the budding site and by creating a network of M-M interactions capable of excluding some host membrane proteins from the viral envelope [17] .",

Most of the protein is localized at the ER, Golgi, and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the site of intracellular trafficking, where it takes part in CoV assembly and budding. According to published studies, 3 roles have been proposed for the CoV E protein: a) the interaction between the cytoplasmic tails of the M and E proteins which suggests that E participates in viral assembly; b) its hydrophobic transmembrane domain is essential for the release of virions; and c) it is implicated in the virus's pathogenesis [11, 18] .",

The receptor binding domains (RBD) sites within the S1 region of a coronavirus S protein vary depending on the virus; some have the RBD at the N-terminus of S1 (MHV), and others (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have the RBD at the C-terminus of S1 [16] . To gain entry into human cells, many \u03b1 coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, TGEV, PEDV, FIPV, CCoV) employ aminopeptidase N (APN) as their receptor, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 utilize angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, MHV enters through CEACAM1, and MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) [18] . After the receptor binding, the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol. This is usually accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by a cathepsin, TMPRRS2, or another protease, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (16) .",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PEDV, for example, cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets that lead to significant morbidity and mortality and results in economic losses [22] . The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) results in the development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [23] . FIP has wet and dry forms and is similar to the human disease sarcoidosis. FIPV is macrophage tropic and may cause aberrant cytokine and/or chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, which results in a lethal disease [23] . The cattle industry has experienced significant losses from bovine coronaviruses (BCoV) that caused significant losses in the cattle industry, and its infection spread a variety of ruminants including elk, giraffe, deer, and camels [3, 15, 24] . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) affects the urogenital tract of chickens, causing renal disease. Egg production is significantly reduced by the infection of the reproductive tract with IBV, causing substantial industrial losses every year [20] . The most intensely studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes a variety of conditions in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections. Thus, MHV is an excellent model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses [22] .",

However, it was not until after the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were discovered in the 1960s and the coronavirus genus was defined that these 3 animal diseases were found to be related [1] . An organ culture of human embryonic trachea taken from a schoolboy with a cold was described by Tyrrell & Bynoe as the first human coronavirus (B814) in 1965 [25] . When examined by an electron microscope, the virus was found to resemble avian IBV. Hamre & Procknow recovered 5 virus strains in tissue culture taken from medical students with colds around the same time [26] . Almeida & Tyrrell examined the prototype strain HCoV 229E, and its morphology was found to be identical to that of B814 and IBV [27] . Using the organ culture technique, 6 further strains were subsequently recovered including the prototype strains HCoV OC43 as well as 3 strains considered antigenically unrelated to either OC43 or 229E [1] .",

This disease spread to Hong Kong in late February, and, within days, international air travel spread the virus over a wide area, seeding outbreaks in Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and elsewhere. In July 2003, at the end of this outbreak, 8422 cases had been recorded, 916 (10.8 %) of them fatal, in 29 country across 6 continents [28] . The point of initial emergence of SARS-CoV an animal reservoir were the live animal markets in Guangdong, where diverse animal species are held, traded and sold to restaurants in response to the demand for exotic food [28] . Small mammals, such as civet cats, sold in these markets were found to harbour viruses closely related to SARS-CoV, and the initial interspecies transmission to humans probably came from these markets [29, 30] . MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia. Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV. As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans [28] .",

When the homology of SARS-CoV-2 and these coronaviruses is less than 75%, it would be presumed that SARS-CoV-2 is not the same virus like the coronaviruses arising from these wild animals [50] . It is also clear from these results that the 2 viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus RaTG13, are closely related [50] . It was also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not come directly from pangolins (24) , so the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin coronavirus and whether the pangolin is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigation [51, 52] .",

S2 subunit is the \"stem\" of the structure, which contains other basic elements needed for the membrane fusion [53] . The spike protein is the common target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect the human respiratory epithelial cells through interaction with the human ACE2 receptor (Figure 3) . Indeed, the recombinant Spike protein can bind with recombinant ACE2 protein [54, 55] . The ACE2 protein is reportedly present in type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes, enterocytes of all parts of the small intestine, the brush border of the proximal arteries, and veins of all tissues studied, and arterial smooth muscle cells [54] . This localization of ACE2 explains the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV for the lung, small intestine, and kidney. However, notable discrepancies include virus replication in colonic epithelium, which has no ACE2, and no virus infection in endothelial cells, which have ACE2, other receptors, or co-receptors such as LSIG that explain such discrepancies [54] .",
