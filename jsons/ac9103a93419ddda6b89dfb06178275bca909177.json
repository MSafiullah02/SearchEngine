With a significantly reduced amount of computation time, the new search method achieves the same accuracy as searches based on the widely used Covariance model (CM) [13] . The new algorithm yields about 24 to 50 times of speed up for the search of pseudoknot-free RNAs with 90 to 150 nucleotides; it gains even more significant advantage for larger RNAs or structures including pseudoknots. In addition, for all the conducted tests, including the searches of medium to large RNAs in bacteria and yeast genomes, parameter k \u2264 7 has been sufficient for the accurate identification.",

We introduce a simple greedy algorithm for tree decomposition that practically runs fast on structure graphs. Given a structure graph H, undirected edges are selected such that removals of these edges from the graph result in an outerplanar graph. The removals of these edges are done by first removing an edge (but not the endpoints) that crosses with the maximum number of other edges, and then repeating the same process until the resulting graph contains no crossing edges. Note that two edges (u, v) and A simple recursive algorithm can find a tree decomposition of tree width 2 for the remaining outerplanar graph. Then for each removed edge (u, v), in the tree we place v in every node on the (shortest) path from a node containing v to a node containing u. The tree decompositon shown in Figure 2 (b) is obtained by first removing crossing edge (3, 5) . Then a tree decomposition for the remaining outerplanar graph is built, which is extended to the tree decomposition for the original graph by placing vertex 3 (in the bold font) in node {1, 5, 4} on the path from node {1, 4, 3} to node {1, 8, 5}.

For training sequences representing distant homologs of an RNA family, we could effectively divide data into groups so that a different but related structure model was built for each group and used for searches.

But the computation time used by the new method was significantly reduced. Figure 6 (a) and (b) respectively show the sensitivity comparison and specificity comparison between the two search methods on pseudoknot-free RNA structures. These structures were from eight RNA families: Entero CRE, SECIS, Lin 4, Entero OriR, Let 7, Tymo tRNA-like, Purine, and S box, in the increasing order of their length. The tree decomposition based algorithm performed quite well for k = 6 and larger values. Figure 6 (c) and (d) respectively show the sensitivity comparison and specificity comparison between the two search methods on RNA pseudoknot structures. These were from six RNA families: Antizyme FSE, corona pk3, HDV ribozyme, Tombus 3 IV, Alpha RBS, and IFN gamma, in the increasing order of their lengths. As for pseudoknot-free structures, the tree decomposition based searches for pseudo- knots achieved the same performance as the CM based method for parameter values k \u2264 7. Figure 7 shows the speed up by the new method over the CM based method, for (a) pseudoknot-free and (b) pseudoknot structures. It is evident that for k = 7 the new method was about 20 to 30 times faster than the other method on pseudoknot-free structures. On the pseudoknot structures, typically on Alpha RBS and Tombus 3 IV containing more than 100 nucleotides, the new method was 66 and 38 times faster, suggesting its advantage in the search of larger and more complex structures. Figure 8 compares the search results obtained by the two methods on three types of RNA pseudoknots in virus, bacteria, and yeast genomes. Parameter k = 7 is used for the parameterized algorithm. Both methods achieve 100% sensitivity and specificity. It clearly shows that the new method had a speed-up of about 30 to 40 times over the other method for searches in virus and bacteria genomes. With the new method, searching genomes of a moderate size for structures as complex as tmRNA gene (see Figure 5 ) only took days, instead of months. Searching a larger genome such as yeast for larger structure like telomerase RNAs was also successful, a task not accomplishable by the CM based system within a reasonable amount of time.",

The running time for algorithm GENSUBGISOMO is O(k t t 2 n), for map width k, tree width t, number of vertices n in H. For each row in the table, the compliance with subgraph isomorphism needs to be validated and a score computed according to formula (1) (by looking up pre-computed values of functions S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ). The former step needs O(t 2 ) and the latter O(t 2 + 2t log 2 k) (note that the rows of a table can be ordered to facilitate binary search by the computation for its parent node). It takes O(knN ) time to preprocess the target sequence of length N to construct the sequence graph. Simultaneously, this step pre-computes the values of functions S 1 , S 2 . The values of function S 3 can then be pre-computed, using time O(k l i=1 l 2 i )= O(knN ), where l i is the length of ith loop and l is the number of loops in the structure. Summing up the times needed by the preprocessing, tree decomposition, and ALGO-RITHM GENSUBGISOMO gives us a loose upper bound O(k t nN ), or O(k t N 2 ), for the total time for the structure-sequence alignment.",
