In a multicenter trial, Ranieri and colleagues randomized 37 patients to receive a strategy directed at ventilating between the upper and lower infl ection points on the pressurevolume curve (Figure 9 .1), versus a higher volume, lower peak endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy targeted at achieving normal blood gas tensions in the control group [6]. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples showed a local and systemic infl ammatory cytokine response at 36 hr among those in the control group, whereas the experimental strategy appeared to diminish this response [6] . In addition, a landmark multicenter trial has brought about the understanding that specifi c strategies for mechanical ventilation can have an important infl uence on outcomes in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In 2000, the ARDS Network investigators demonstrated a 22% relative reduction in mortality among adult patients with ARDS on conventional mechanical ventilation who were randomized to receive relatively small tidal volumes (6 mL/kg ideal body weight) compared with those who were ventilated with larger tidal volumes (12 mL/kg ideal body weight) [13] . Collectively, these observations on the benefi ts of tidal volume reduction have led to the expectation that high-frequency ventilation would have an important role in the clinical arena because of its unique ability to provide adequate gas exchange using very low tidal volumes in the setting of continuous alveolar recruitment. Theoretically, high-frequency ventilation provides the ultimate open-lung strategy of ventilation, preserving end-expiratory lung volume, minimizing cyclic stretch, and avoiding parenchymal overdistension at end inspiration by limiting tidal volume and transpulmonary pressure (Figure 9 .2) [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "Data supporting the feasibility of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) come from the observation that delivering very tidal volumes small at high frequencies can overcome the need for adequate bulk gas fl ow in the lung. In the early 1970s, while attempting to measure cardiac performance in large animals by assessing the myocardial response to pericardial pressure oscillations, Lunkenheimer and colleagues found that endotracheal high-frequency oscillations could produce effi cient CO 2 elimination in the absence of signifi cant chest wall excursion [1, 2] . These investigators determined that CO 2 elimination was related to changes in the frequency of oscillation as well as the amplitude of the vibrations [1] . In general, CO 2 was cleared optimally at a frequency between 23-40 Hz, with smaller animals requiring higher frequencies [1] . Several years later, Butler and colleagues observed that gas exchange could be supported in humans at a frequency of 15 Hz, hypothesizing that this would enhance diffusive gas transport while minimizing dependence on bulk convective gas fl ow in the airways [3] . In their study, a series of patients, 9 years of age and older, were successfully ventilated with a piston pump calibrated to deliver tidal volumes in the range of 50-150 mL, and a single 2.5-kg infant was supported with a tidal volume of 7.5 mL using the same device [3] .",

There is also a growing quantity of clinical data that support these observations. A recent singlecenter cohort study demonstrated that among 332 patients who did and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Highfrequency oscillatory ventilation is the most widely used form of high-frequency ventilation in clinical practice today. In HFOV, lung recruitment is maintained by the application of relatively high mean airway pressure, while ventilation is achieved by superimposed sinusoidal pressure oscillations that are delivered by a motor-driven piston or diaphragm at a frequency of 3-15 Hz [7, 14] . High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is the only form of highfrequency ventilation in which expiration is an active process. As a result, alveolar ventilation is achieved during HFOV with the use of tidal volumes in the range of 1-3 mL/kg, even in the most poorly compliant lungs [14] .",

Although direct bulk fl ow can account for ventilation of proximal alveolar units even at very low tidal volumes, it is now believed that Pendelluft, or mixing of gases among alveolar units with varying time constants, contributes signifi cantly to gas exchange at high frequencies [15] [16] [17] . In addition, effi cient gas mixing likely occurs along the parabolic inspiratory gas front in high-frequency oscillation, because this provides an increased area along which radial diffusion can occur [15, 16] . Finally, axial asymmetry of inspiratory and expiratory gas fl ow profi les creates separation of fresh gas and exhaled gas so that inspiratory gas fl ow travels down the central axis of the airway, while expiratory fl ow is distributed along the airway wall [15, 16] .",

Alveolar recruitment is positively correlated with the mean airway pressure (Paw) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I : E) [20] . Although most of the research using HFOV has focused on the use of higher frequency ranges, CO 2 elimination can probably occur at many potential combinations of f and Vt 2 , with higher frequency ranges providing conditions of lowest lung impedance and, consequently, a lower pressure cost of ventilation [21, 22] .

Most of the experience with HFOV in the clinical arena involves the SensorMedics 3100A (SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, CA), which is approved for use in infants and children. Almost 20 years of study using this device in the laboratory have provided clinicians with a fundamental understanding of its performance characteristics. Using in vitro models as well as alveolar capsule techniques in small animals with open chests, several investigators have reported that mean airway pressure and \u0394P are signifi cantly attenuated by the tracheal tube, that alveolar pressure is inhomogeneously distributed during HFOV, and that the I : E ratio is an important determinant of alveolar pressure [20, [23] [24] [25] . Specifi cally, early data from surfactant-defi cient small animals, as well as from large animals and humans, seemed to indicate that limitation of expiratory time using an I : E ratio of 1 : 1 would promote alveolar gas trapping, especially at lower mean airway pressures [20, [26] [27] [28] . This observation led to the suggestion that HFOV be applied in the clinical setting with an I : E ratio of no greater than 1 : 2.",

Once adequate alveolar recruitment is achieved, it may be possible to capitalize on pulmonary hysteresis, evident in many regions of the lung early in the course of disease (see Figure 9 .1) [30] , by carefully adjusting the Paw downward as long as the oxygenating effi ciency is preserved. Alternatively, after a brief period of aggressive volume recruitment, the Paw can be dropped to a point that is known to be above the closing pressure, with the expectation that adequate tidal volume will be preserved [30] . Adequacy of lung recruitment is verifi ed by ensuring that both hemidiaphragms are displaced to the level of the ninth posterior rib on chest x-ray [14] . A typical sequence of steps for addressing hypercarbia once an appropriate degree of lung infl ation as well as patency of the tracheal tube are verifi ed would be (1) increasing the \u0394P in increments of 3 cm H 2 O until power is maximized, (2) decreasing the frequency in increments of 0.5-1 Hz, and (3) partially defl ating the tracheal tube cuff, if available, to allow additional egress of CO 2 [31] [32] [33] .

Following laboratory investigations that demonstrated adequate gas exchange at lower intrapulmonary pressures and reduced incidence of pulmonary air leak with the use of HFOV in surfactantdefi cient small animals [37, 38] , a substantial amount of data have accumulated on the use of HFOV in humans for the management of the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The fi rst large randomized, controlled trial with premature infants comparing high-frequency ventilation using a piston oscillator with conventional mechanical ventilation was published in the pre-surfactant era by the HIFI Study Group in 1989 [39] . The study was designed to evaluate the effect of high-frequency ventilation on the incidence of chronic lung disease of prematurity and included 673 infants weighing 750-2,000 g who had been supported less than 12 hr on conventional ventilation for respiratory failure in the fi rst 24 hours of life. Infants randomized to receive HFOV were administered an FiO 2 and Paw equal to those administered on conventional ventilation. Infants who had not already been tracheally intubated were administered an FiO 2 equal to that received before intubation and a Paw of 8-10 cm H 2 O. Hypoxemia was fi rst addressed by increasing the FiO 2 and then by increasing the Paw [39] . Overall, the investigators did not incorporate alveolar recruitment into the HFOV strategy, and the study was unable to show a signifi cant difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease or in 28-day mortality between the two groups. However, it did show a signifi cant increase in the incidence of air leak as well as highgrade intraventricular hemorrhage among the infants who were randomized to receive HFOV [39] .",

            "text": "Two additional large multicenter trials were recently published in an effort to clarify the role of high-frequency ventilation in the management of RDS in preterm infants [40, 41] . Unlike the HIFI trial and subsequent studies that produced confl icting results [42, 43] , these two trials were produced by centers with a great deal of experience with the use of HFOV in neonates, and each emphasized alveolar recruitment as part of the strategy for high-frequency ventilation. In a well-controlled study, Courtney and colleagues used a strategy in the conventional ventilation arm that targeted a tidal volume of 5-6 mL per kg body weight and ventilated infants in the HFOV arm at a frequency of 10-15 Hz [40] . These investigators were able to show that infants randomized to receive HFOV with the 3100A were successfully separated from mechanical ventilation earlier than those assigned to a lung-sparing strategy of conventional ventilation, and, among the infants assigned to highfrequency ventilation, there was a signifi cant decrease in the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [40] . By defi ning a disease threshold in the study infants, adhering to lungprotective protocols for mechanical ventilation, and extubating from the assigned ventilator according to specifi c criteria, this study identifi ed a set of circumstances in which HFOV may be used with clear benefi t in preterm infants with RDS [40] . In contrast, Johnson and colleagues included healthier patients, used fewer defi ned protocols, and used more aggressive ventilator strategies [41] . In both study arms, the investigators targeted a PaCO 2 of 34-53 torr, whereas Courtney and colleagues used a ventilation strategy that allowed permissive hypercapnia [40] . For those infants who were supported on HFOV, Johnson and colleagues initiated therapy at a frequency of 10 Hz, and, if maximizing amplitude (\u0394P) did not achieve adequate clearance of CO 2 , the frequency was subsequently reduced [41] . Finally, Johnson's group transitioned the majority of B A study infants to conventional ventilation for weaning after a median time on HFOV of 3 days, a relatively small portion of the total duration of mechanical ventilation [41] .",

The discovery that ventilator-induced lung injury is evident on histopathology specimens from these patients [45, 46] has continued to focus attention in recent years on applying lung-protective strategies of mechanical ventilation to infants with CDH. As a result, numerous centers have reported case series of infants with CDH in whom the application of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation has been associated with an improvement in survival [47] [48] [49] . Several retrospective studies of HFOV in infants with CDH have also reported improved survival, with dramatic reductions in PaCO 2 and concurrent improvements in oxygenation [48, 49] . At least one center using HFOV without the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in infants with CDH has reported an overall survival rate comparable to that of infants who were supported with conventional ventilation and ECMO, although no survival benefi t specifically attributable to the use of HFOV was identifi ed [45] . Nonetheless, some of the best survival statistics for CDH are reported in one recent single-center historical experience in which these infants were managed with conventional ventilation. This report documented a signifi cant increase in survival from 44% to 69% among all infants with this condition during a period in which fl ow-triggered pressure support ventilation with permissive hypercapnia was used. Even higher survival rates were noted in those without coexisting heart disease [50] .",

Centers that report success with HFOV in the management of infants with CDH have found that it is important to limit Paw to \u226420 cm H 2 O in order to avoid alveolar overdistension [17] .

The investigators randomized 200 neonates with severe hypoxic respiratory failure and PPHN to receive therapy with HFOV alone or conventional ventilation combined with iNO [51] . Crossover as a result of treatment failure resulted in combined therapy with HFOV and iNO. The study concluded that signifi cant short-term improvements in PaO 2 occurred during combined treatment with HFOV and iNO among patients who failed either therapy alone [51] . This combination was particularly effective among patients with severe parenchymal disease attributable to RDS and meconium aspiration [51] .

In general, each concluded that HFOV may be applied safely as rescue therapy for pediatric patients with severe hypoxic lung injury and that its use is associated with improvement in physiologic end-points such as PaCO 2 and oxygenation index, OI = (Paw \u00d7 FiO 2 )/PaO 2 ) \u00d7 100. In addition, there were no reports of worsening air leak [35, 56] . Each of these studies applied HFOV after recruiting the lung, but one of them [35] modifi ed the HFOV protocol for patients with active air leak by dropping the Paw below the leak pressure following recruitment, raising the FiO 2 as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation, and tolerating hypercarbia as long as the arterial pH remained above 7.25.",

The investigators randomized 70 patients to receive conventional ventilation using a strategy to limit peak inspiratory pressure, or HFOV at a frequency of 5-10 Hz, using an open lung strategy in which the lung volume at which optimal oxygenation occurred was defi ned (SaO 2 \u226590% and FiO 2 <0.6), and, in patients with air leak, airway pressure was then limited while accepting preferential increases in FiO 2 to achieve saturations of \u226585% and pH \u22657.25 until it resolved [34] . The study found no difference in survival or duration of mechanical ventilatory support between the two groups, but signifi cantly fewer patients randomized to receive HFOV remained dependent on supplemental oxygen at 30 days compared with those who were randomized to receive conventional ventilation, despite the use of signifi cantly higher Paw in the HFOV group [34] . The OI, used often in the pediatric literature to quantify oxygenation failure, was shown in this study to discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors after 24 hours of therapy. In addition, the time at which changes in OI were noted to occur infl uenced the likelihood of survival: an OI \u226542 at 24 hr predicted mortality with an odds ratio of 20.8, sensitivity of 62%, and specifi city of 93% [34] . Post hoc analysis revealed that outcome benefi ts were not as great for those who crossed over to the HFOV arm [34] , supporting the suggestion by numerous studies that HFOV may be most successful if employed early in the course of disease, using a strategy that emphasizes alveolar recruitment [9, 37, [56] [57] [58] .",

Global measures of alveolar plateau pressure, tidal volume, and pulmonary mechanics that are available from breath to breath when using conventional ventilation are not provided on the high-frequency ventilator console, and the operator must often use intuition when adjusting ventilator settings, risking sudden and clinically signifi cant derecruitment or alveolar overdistension. In recent years, respiratory impedance plethysmography (RIP) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have emerged as two promising means by which pulmonary mechanics and alveolar recruitment can be assessed noninvasively at the bedside during HFOV.",

In RIP, two elastic bands with Tefl on-coated wires embedded in a zigzag distribution along their circumference are applied to the patient. One is typically placed around the chest, 3 cm above the xiphoid process, and the other is typically placed around the abdomen. Each of these two bands produces an independent signal, and the sum of the two signals is calibrated against a known volume of gas. Use of this technique in association with HFOV has been validated in animal models [64, 65] . In a large animal model of acute lung injury managed with HFOV, Brazelton and colleagues have demonstrated that RIP-derived lung volumes correlated well with those that were obtained using a supersyringe (r 2 = 0.78) and that RIP is capable of tracking global changes in lung volume and creating a pressurevolume curve during HFOV [64] . With a newborn animal model, Weber and colleagues were able to demonstrate that RIP is capable of detecting relative changes in pulmonary compliance that were induced by saline lavage [65] . Experience with RIP in human subjects is limited to investigations of its application in conventional phasic ventilation. One study with adult patients [66] and another with pediatric patients [67] have utilized RIP to quantify the relative degree of derecruitment that is associated with closed, in-line techniques for endotracheal tube suctioning compared with open suctioning techniques. Each study was able to demonstrate a potential role for RIP in tracking global changes in lung volume at the bedside.",

The electrodes sequentially emit a small amount of electrical current that is received and processed by the other electrodes in the array.

Well-aerated areas, which conduct current poorly, are associated with high impedance, whereas fl uid and solid phases (including atelectatic or consolidated lung) would be associated with lower impedance [70] . The impedance values that are generated are referenced to a baseline measurement and represent relative rather than absolute changes in electrical properties [69] . This process creates a tomogram that depicts the distribution of tissue electrical properties in a cross-sectional image (Figure 9 .6), and the thickness of the slice of thorax that is represented in the image varies between approximately 15 and 20 cm, depending on the circumference of the chest [69, 71] .

Theoretically, this technology can create opportunities for therapeutic intervention by dynamically tracking the regional differences in alveolar recruitment that make portions of the lung highly susceptible to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, there are important limitations to the presently available technology. For instance, substantial bias may be introduced into the EIT image because of the tendency for electrical current to follow the path of lowest impedance rather than the path of shortest distance between the transmitting and receiving electrodes [70] . This phenomenon may account in large part for the variation between EIT measures of regional lung impedance and CT measures of regional lung density [76] . In addition, because EIT measures impedance changes that are relative to baseline values, changes in baseline regional intrathoracic impedance resulting from sources other than alterations in gas volume and distribution could lead to errors in the interpretation of EIT-derived data. Despite these limitations, several investigators have reported that EIT reliably detects regional alterations in pulmonary blood fl ow [78] and extravascular lung water [79] . In summary, identifying a useful role for EIT as an adjunct to HFOV at the bedside will depend on additional technical modifi cations to make it suitable for reliably detecting very small regional tidal volumes at high frequency in the electrically hostile environment of the intensive care unit.",

Some investigators have reported successfully extubating infants directly from HFOV [40, 41, 57] , but this is diffi cult to accomplish in the older pediatric and adult patient, who may be less likely to tolerate a degree of sedation that would allow spontaneous respiration while on HFOV and in whom spontaneous breathing may signifi cantly depressurize the circuit, resulting in recurrent alveolar derecruitment. In general, when clinical improvement occurs to the point that Paw may be reduced to \u226420 cm H 2 O, FiO2 is reduced to \u22640.4, and the patient tolerates endotracheal suctioning without signifi cant desaturation, it is appropriate to undertake a more detailed evaluation of the patient's response to phasic ventilation provided by conventional means [17] . This may be done by hand ventilating (with the aid of an in-line pneumotachometer, if necessary) while noting the pressures, tidal volume, and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio necessary to sustain satisfactory oxygen saturation. It is common to fi nd on transition to conventional ventilation that the patient will demonstrate satisfactory gas exchange on a mean airway pressure several cm H 2 O below the last Paw on HFOV.",

The diffi culty in proving signifi cant clinical outcome benefi t in pediatric and adult patients may be due in large part to the diverse potential etiologies of respiratory failure in these populations as well as a wide range of approaches to their medical management applied over a relatively long period of mechanical ventilatory support.

Applying this concept with greater precision in the clinical arena will depend on developing bedside technologies capable of both identifying the critical opening pressure in a majority of lung units and tracking regional changes in lung volume that follow changes in HFOV settings. Electrical impedance tomography is a promising technology that may ultimately be incorporated into the design of future trials that are powered to evaluate the benefi ts of specifi c HFOV protocols.",
