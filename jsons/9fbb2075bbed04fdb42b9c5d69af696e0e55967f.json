Among them, the Singapore models 1 and CDDEP models 2 are popular. These models are available for several countries, including India. Some India-specific studies are also available based on early data. A study by Ranjan 3 estimated a final epidemic size of 13,000 cases and expected that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020. This study considered three models: (i) exponential model, (ii) logistic model, and (iii) SIR model. Menon 4 described four studies based on SIER (Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, and Recovered) model. These are: (i) ICMR study that suggested 100 cases at the peak for every 10,000 people under optimistic scenario, amounting to 1.35 crore infected, (ii) Michigan study that predicted 16 cases per 100,000 population in the absence of any intervention, (iii) Hopkins study, which originates from IndiaSIM model, which predicted 1 crore to 2.5 crore affected in India at its peak, and (iv) Cambridge model that considered 21-day lockdown and expected a decline immediately thereafter. The author rightly said that none is believable. In any case, these were early efforts when data availability was scanty.",

This decline in the rate of increase could be the direct result of social distancing and lockdown. We expect this decline will continue for quite some time except towards the end, after reaching to 0.1%. The rate of decline of increase is expected to slow down at this level because some cases will continue to crop up. When this is used for projection, the cumulative number of cases is likely to be 1,27,000 by the end of May and 1,75,000 by the end of June 2020. With this trend, the number of new cases is likely to peak to nearly 3300 per day during the fourth week of May after which it will decline, and the expected shape of the epidemic curve is shown in Figure 1 .

This underscores the importance of our in-built immunity, either due to vegetarian diet in a large segment of population or due to highly prevalent BCG vaccination 17 .The second is that the case-fatality is not less than 5% as is generally considered 18 . When the cases with known outcomes are considered, the case-fatality is nearly 10%. This may eventually decline as our medical care system learns to manage these cases and new strategies such as convalescent plasma therapy 19 and drugs such as Remedesivir 20 succeed. ",

We are also not using the reproduction number (R 0 ) that is commonly used for infectious disease modeling. This may look like a limitation but the projection is based on the trend seen for more than 50 consecutive days. This is substantial to study the trend and projection that predicts much less suffering and loss of life in India compared with most European countries and the U.S. We hope that we have been able to capture the salient feature of this trend and the projection will be largely true that could bring the relief in sight.",

According to this model, the peak is expected with nearly 3300 cases per day in the fourth week of May. The number of cumulative cases will never decrease but a plateau is likely around the first week of June with only less than 100 new cases per day. The peak number of active cases is expected to be around 75,000, after which the cases with outcome (recovery or death) will be more than the number if new cases. This defines the peak requirement of the medical care facilities. The case-fatality is likely to be around 10% unless therapies such as plasma or Remedesivir succeed.",
