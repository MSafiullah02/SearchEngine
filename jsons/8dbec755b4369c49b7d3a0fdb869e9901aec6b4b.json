However, there has been a more limited evaluation of the impact of race on immediate perioperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes among different races. Study Design The 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database was queried to identify patients aged \u2265 18 and body mass index \u2265 35 who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with known information on race. We then evaluated the effect of five different races on four different 30-day outcomes. Results Of the total 106,932 patients (79.5% White, 19.3% African American (AA), 0.5% Asian, 0.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander), 30-day rates of postoperative complication, readmission, reintervention, and reoperation were 6, 3.8, 1.3, and 1.2%, respectively. After controlling for other covariates in multivariate logistic regression and selecting White as reference, AA was the only race associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.13; confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.2) and readmissions (OR 1.47; CI 1.3-1.6). AA and American Indian or Alaska Native were also associated with higher re-interventions (OR 1.31; CI 1.15-1.51 and OR 2.11; CI 1.03-4.34). Furthermore, AA was associated with lower 30-day reoperations (OR 0.83; CI 0.7-0.9). Conclusion This study found significant racial differences in short-term outcomes following bariatric surgery. Factors underlying these disparities are unclear and warrant further investigation.",

Based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports, Asian adults had the lowest obesity prevalence in 2017 while non-Hispanic black adults (39%) had the highest, followed by American Indian/Alaska Native (38.7%), Hispanic (32.4%), and non-Hispanic White adults (29.3%) [1] . Among proposed etiologies for this disproportionate distribution are socio-economic factors and their effects on nutrition [9] , genetic differences [10] , and possible ethnic differences in fat metabolism [11] . Additionally, there is evidence of gender disparity with female dominance [12] and unequal utilization of bariatric surgery with fewer African Americans undergoing these procedures compared with Whites [13] despite a higher obesity rate in the former. Furthermore, there is evidence of disparate long-term response to bariatric procedures especially disproportionate success in weight loss among different races [14] [15] [16] . While there are numerous studies on these aspects of disparity in metabolic and bariatric surgery especially related to longterm outcomes, there has been limited evaluation of the impact of race on the short-term postoperative outcomes of these procedures, which constitutes the primary aim of this study.",

They additionally showed significantly higher mortality rate in Black patients who had SG. Although race and specifically non-Hispanic Black race has been reported as an independent predictor of mortality [19] , the mortality rate in this study was 0.1% and we did not find any significant difference in this variable among racial groups in our study population. Additionally, we also observed significantly longer length of stay in African Americans in this study (Table 4 ), a disparity that has been reported in other fields of surgery as well, and one that Wahl et al. [20] successfully eliminated in a study between Black and White patients undergoing colorectal surgery with enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. Tiwari and colleagues [21] have also used a database with more than 37,000 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass over 4 years and reported race as a risk factor affecting postoperative outcomes in these patients. They also reported that a 30-day readmission was significantly higher in non-Hispanic Blacks compared with non-Hispanic Whites. African American race has been reported as an independent risk factor for readmission in many other studies as well [22] [23] [24] . In this study, the majority of readmissions (78%) were associated with the metabolic and bariatric procedure.

However, we found results in univariate analyses that are comparable with previous studies. For instance, occurrence of PE was 1.93 times higher in AAs compared with Whites in our study, which may be secondary to a biological predilection, although this is unknown, and is especially puzzling since there were no significant differences in the preoperative rates of venous thromboembolism. This is comparable with the results of a study by Turner and colleagues [25] using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2007 and reported increased rates of certain postoperative complications including 2.5 times higher PE in African American patients. Venous thrombosis was the third most common reason for readmission in AA patients in this study. Notably, preoperative IVC filter was significantly higher in AAs compared with White patients, while the preoperative rates of DVT or PE were not different between these two racial groups. However, over 80% of AAs who had IVC filter preoperatively received it in anticipation of the bariatric procedure as opposed to a pre-existing filter (18%). These findings are not easily explained. The higher mean preoperative BMI in the AA group and possibly anticipated longer operation times could perhaps account for the significantly higher rates of preoperative IVC filter placement in AAs compared with Whites even though the preoperative PE and DVT rates were similar between the groups. In addition to postoperative outcomes, there were some differences in the patient characteristics, comorbidities, and perioperative factors (Tables 1, 2, and 3) among different races that were adjusted for in the multivariate logistic regression. For instance, despite LSG being the most common procedure performed in all racial groups, LRYGB was performed with even lower rates in AAs compared with Whites, which is similar to what was reported by Worni and colleagues [26] on the trends of LRYGB among different races from 2002 to 2008. However, this difference in the two procedures declined to the point that they were performed in almost equal proportions in Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander patients.",
