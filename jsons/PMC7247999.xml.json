They were surprised by what they found: an improvement of overall morale, instead of an expected decline (Uchida et al., 2014; see also Quarantelli, 1985). Similarly, through nationally representative panel data of French residents, we find that the perception of both health and well-being during the Covid-19 epidemic has improved in comparison to previous years. We name this counterintuitive phenomenon the \u201ceye of the hurricane\u201d paradox: the vast majority of individuals who are not infected by the virus may be seeing their general health and sense of subjective well-being in a more positive light than they normally would. There are, however, divergences across social groups that reflect socioeconomic inequalities. Particularly, manual workers deviate from the prevailing trend, as their level of self-reported health declines over the lockdown period.",

Self-assessed health is ranked on a five-point scale ranging from \u2018very bad\u2019 to \u2018very good\u2019. To capture subjective well-being in a holistic way, we constructed an index combining panelists\u2019 responses to six different questions regarding how often they have felt \u2018nervous\u2019, \u2018low\u2019, \u2018relaxed\u2019, \u2018sad\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018stressed out\u2019 over the previous two-week period on a five-point scale from \u2018never\u2019 to \u2018always\u2019. Negative feelings are inverted to enable the construction of an additive index, which was then normalized between 0 (lowest) and 1 (highest). \u2018Lockdown-related stress\u2019 was based on the response to the question \u2018Does the lockdown take a toll on you?\u2019 measured on a 0 to 10 point scale from \u2018not at all\u2019 to \u2018enormously\u2019.",

However, this dramatic rise was not felt uniformly across French society. This is particularly the case among blue-collar workers for whom the proportion of those feeling good or very good has declined since the lockdown began (Fig. 1\n, top-left panel). To some extent, this may be related to their exposure to risk during the epidemic, as we also find that the incidence rate of Covid-19 is higher among manual workers, reaching 11.2 percent in our latest survey (early May), as opposed to 6.2 percent in the rest of the population.2\nThe gap in self-assessed \u2018good/very good\u2019 health between blue-collar workers (55 percent) on the one hand and managers and farmers (90 percent) on the other is impressive. Farmers are the occupational category that fares the best, in continuity with surveys from the two preceding years. Overall, with the remarkable exception of manual workers, the rise in the level of self-reported good health is widespread and reflects the pre-existing hierarchy of working conditions among occupations.",

Although it shrinks slightly (but not significantly) as the lockdown progresses, the gap between income groups remains relatively constant before and after the start of the lockdown. In sum, the epidemic seems to trigger health inequalities that are occupation-specific rather than income-related. Apparently, for low-income earners, health risks are concentrated among blue-collar workers. Other socioeconomic factors have an impact as well, given that good health is significantly less prevalent among the most financially vulnerable (i.e. people who say they cannot afford an unexpected \u20ac400 bill), women, older people and respondents living in smaller homes (after controlling for all other relevant variables, see Appendix A).

Although clerks exhibit a steep upswing, the generalized increase is less marked than that for general health (bottom-left panel, Fig. 1). Why such uniformity across social groups when it comes to subjective well-being? From a comparative perspective, the robustness of the welfare system may be a factor (France has the highest level of social spending among OECD countries), as the state granted rather generous unemployment benefits to full-time employees who were temporarily laid off (chomage partiel, at least 84% of former salary) during the crisis.",

Moreover, new regional disparities emerge during the lockdown. Controlling for the average level of subjective well-being in each survey (i.e., accounting for an overall change due to Covid-19) and the average level for each individual (e.g. accounting for low-income survey participants or residents in Paris being less happy in general), we show in Fig. 2\nthat residents in the Paris region experienced a sizeable and significant decrease in their subjective well-being score compared to the rest of the country (the drop amounts to around 7% of the overall average). Perhaps housing constraints and the paucity of green spaces in Paris exacerbate the negative impact of the sudden disappearance of the most attractive features of la capitale -- its dynamic cultural, artistic and entertainment life. Without theatres, museums, cafes and street life, Paris may be more suffocating than your average French town. Under such conditions, the Simmelian blas\u00e9 character of Parisians looks to have been shaken for once.",

This measure has not changed significantly over the three waves of our survey. To some extent, we find that it reflects work-hours and type of workplace (Fig. 3\n). The longer respondents\u2019 work-hours are, the stronger the sentiment is that the quarantine exhausts them. This is especially true for those who spend long working days at home in front of their computers or answering the phone. This flies in the face of arguments praising the advantages of home-working (e.g., Bloom 2014), which may protect one from the virus but seems to entail psychological costs. Such costs are even higher for teleworkers who rarely went outside during confinement. For teleworkers who leave home only once a week or less, each additional hour of daily work means an increase of stress levels by around 4% compared to teleworkers who go out more frequently.",

While instances of this phenomenon - have been observed in the aftermath of other socially disruptive events, only research conducted elsewhere during the worldwide Covid-19 crisis may tell us to what extent this may be a culturally-specific reaction. Likewise, only further survey waves once the pandemic is over will allow us to assess whether such a change is a temporary shock or the beginning of a new normal.",
