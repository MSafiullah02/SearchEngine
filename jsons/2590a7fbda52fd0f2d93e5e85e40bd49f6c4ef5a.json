These methods rely on antigen-antibody interactions, and they can be adapted to allow direct detection of the virus (antigen detection) or to identify the host's immune response to the virus infection (antibody detection). The methods are also used to identify and characterize virus isolates following in vitro or in vivo propagation. Although molecular detection is often more sensitive than antigen detection, immunological methods still have an important role in the study of the epidemiology, pathology, and assessment of clinical disease associated with viral infection. The development of simple, rapid, and often relatively inexpensive antigen detection test kits has revolutionized both clinical care and laboratory practice. An understanding of various detection methods is increasingly important in the design and interpretation of epidemiologic studies. The vast array of laboratory tests now permits enhanced detection of viral antigens, although the clarification of the classic issue of \"causation\" of disease remains blurred.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The significance of detection or lack of detection of a virus or viral antigen remains difficult to interpret. Isolation of a virus from a normally sterile site, such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood, is generally highly significant and usually establishes the etiology of the infection. The identification of certain viruses, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens, also is diagnostic because an asymptomatic carrier state has not been shown to exist. However, prolonged and generally asymptomatic excretion or shedding of other viruses can make the determination of the effect of a particular virus on the disease process very difficult. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenoviruses, and enteroviruses are shed in disease states but also may be shed asymptomatically for prolonged periods of apparent good health. An additional complicating factor is the differentiation of primary infection from reactivation of disease, a problem common to the study of infections with viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV) or CMV, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients or patients infected with HIV. Interpretation of laboratory results in such situations requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Failure to detect a virus or viral antigen does not necessarily mean that the virus was not present previously or did not cause disease.

It was another several decades before diagnostic viral serological methods were developed, including complement fixation in the 1930s and hemagglutination inhibition in the 1940s [2] . Immunofluorescent methods for detecting virus antigen were developed in the 1950s by labeling virus-specific antibodies with a fluorescent reporter such as fluorescein isothiocyanate [3] . A little more than one decade after the initial description in 1959 of the radioimmunoassay [4] for detecting human plasma insulin, the method was adapted for virus antigen detection [5] . The radioisotope used as a reporter was replaced later during the 1970s with enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase that allowed colorimetric detection [6] . The method was also readily modified (see below) to allow detection of antibody. A further modification of immunoassay detection methods followed with the use of substrates that allowed detection of the antigen-antibody interaction via measurement of a chemiluminescent reaction. The diagnostic procedures used for evaluation of specific viral infections are presented in individual chapters of this book.

When the immune response is the production of antibody, the generated antigen-specific antibody can bind directly to the antigen. The portion of the antigen recognized by and specifically interacting with the antibody molecule is called an epitope. An antigen may have more than one epitope. When this occurs the epitopes either may be distinct molecular structures (and thus distinct epitopes) or they may be the same molecular structure (the same epitope) repeated many times. The portion of the antibody interacting with the antigen is called a paratope. The ability of the epitope and paratope to bind to each other is the basis of the specificity of an antigen-antibody interaction. The binding of antibody to antigen is thought to be the result of electrostatic and van der Waals bonding over short distances, with the kinetics of the reaction following the law of mass action.

These include the temperature of the reaction conditions and the ionic strength of the solutions used in the assay. As noted above, antibody affinity and concentration are particularly important when developing an antigen detection assay. The relative concentration of antigenspecific antibody is lowest in postinfection sera. It can be increased through hyperimmunization with the antigen to generate polyclonal antisera, and the relative concentration can be increased further by affinity purification of the antibody. The highest relative concentrations are reached through the generation of monoclonal antibodies, and selection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic assays is now widely used in the development of antigen detection assays [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 908, "end": 911, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principles of Antigen-Antibody Interactions"}, {"text": "Another factor that can influence the assay development is nonspecific interactions between the antibody and other substances in the reaction mix (e.g., attachment to the reaction vessel, other microbial antigens).

Many of the low-affinity interactions can be removed by washing steps, use of blocking reagents and use of lower concentrations of antibody, but each antibody used in a diagnostic assay should be evaluated for the presence of these nonspecific reactions.

Knowledge of the restrictions of the diagnostic assay to be used is also important; many antigen detection assays are only approved for use when applied to a limited number of clinical sample types. For example, some influenza antigen assays should only be used with nasal swabs while other assays are approved for detection of influenza in a broad array of respiratory samples types, including nasal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, and bronchoalveolar lavage [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 923, "end": 926, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Specimen Collection"}, {"text": "The clinical syndrome caused by a virus and its pathogenesis of infection determine the specimen(s) that is most appropriate for virus identification. Viruses that primarily cause disease at a mucosal surface or cause vesicular skin lesions generally can be identified in specimens taken from those sites. However, viruses causing generalized or congenital disease or causing symptoms in an internal organ (e.g., central nervous system) often can be identified in specimens taken from multiple different sites. Viruses that cause respiratory tract disease such as influenza viruses, RSV, and rhinoviruses are most frequently identified in samples of respiratory secretions; viruses that cause gastroenteritis, such as rotaviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses, are identified in fecal specimens; and viruses that cause generalized or congenital diseases, such as measles, CMV, and mumps, are identified from respiratory secretions, urine, and blood. However, antigen detection methods may not be available for some of these different sample types.

Some factors that influence the likelihood of successful virus identification include the type of virus, the site from which the sample was obtained, the test being used, the age of the patient being sampled (e.g., younger children shed influenza viruses longer than adults), and the immune competence of the patient (e.g., immunocompromised hosts shed HSV from genital lesions longer than do immunocompetent adults) [12] . A serum sample should be collected early in the course of illness for potential use in identification of a viral infection.

Although the detection of antibodies to specific viral proteins remains an important element of viral epidemiology, the ability to isolate and/or characterize viral pathogens initially is critically important. The performance of any diagnostic test in a reproducible, sensitive, and specific manner is crucial in the study of viral diseases. Combinations of various techniques, including centrifugation-enhanced tissue culture, antibody-antigen detection, and detection of viral nucleic acid, can be used to supplement classic tissue culture methods. Methods for the detection of virus-specific antigens have allowed rapid identification of a wide variety of viruses (Table 3 .1). Specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated to biochemical markers may provide high levels of sensitivity and specificity [13] . The key to the success of the assays outlined below is the use of reliable virus-specific antibody.

Immunofluorescence (IF) assays are widely used for the rapid detection of viruses in clinical samples and for definitive identification of a virus in tissue culture that may allow viral antigens to be sought before or after cytopathic effect (CPE) is evident. In the direct IF test ( Fig. 3.1) , the virus-specific antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye such as fluorescein isothiocyanate or, less commonly, rhodamine isothiocyanate is allowed to react for a short time with cells obtained from a clinical specimen or from an inoculated cell culture. After allowing time for an antigen-antibody reaction to occur, the slides are washed and examined microscopically for direct visualization of the fluorescence of the infected cells in the specimen. In the indirect IF test, two different antisera are used: an unlabeled virus-specific antibody capable of binding to a specific viral antigen is used first and is followed by a fluorescein-labeled, species-specific antibody directed against the species in which the first antibody was raised. If a reaction occurs between the first antiserum and the clinical specimen, the second antibody will bind to the antigen-antibody complex and fluorescence of the virus-infected cells can be detected. The two IF methods each have advantages and disadvantages. Both tests allow an assessment of the quality of the sample in that samples that do not contain cells are poor quality and cannot be interpreted. The indirect IF is usually more sensitive because several fluorescein-conjugated molecules potentially are able to bind to each virus-specific antibody molecule attached to the viral antigen, resulting in amplification of the fluorescence. The direct IF test may offer enhanced specificity due to lower background fluorescence. The indirect IF method requires more reagents and more time to perform. Whether monoclonal or polyclonal antisera are optimal for use in either test method is still debated. The use of monoclonal antibodies generally provides the lowest background but may be limited by the high specificity of these reactions. This problem can usually be overcome by using a pool of monoclonal antibodies. The use of IF for the direct detection of viral antigens in clinical samples and the confirmation of viral growth in cell cultures has increased with the widespread commercial availability of relatively inexpensive antibodies specific for many of the herpesviruses and respiratory viruses. The IF method has the advantage of allowing rapid viral diagnosis in properly obtained specimens [17] [18] [19] [20] . When working with large numbers of clinical specimens, the time required for sample collection, processing, and interpretation of the stained slide becomes substantial. The enthusiasm for this technique in clinical specimens has varied due to the time and degree of technical competence required to read such samples, the availability of other, the less labor-intensive antigen detection methods, and the frequency of falsenegative results obtained because of the dependence of the assay on having a high degree of viral antigen expression in the clinical sample. Nevertheless, the appropriate use of this test can result in reliable and sensitive rapid diagnosis from clinical samples. The use of IF for the detection of RSV in pediatric patients by an experienced laboratory can detect up to 90-95 % of the samples positive by culture [21, 22] , although many laboratories report rates of 60-80 % [23] [24] [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 137, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2702, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2703, "end": 2707, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2708, "end": 2712, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3552, "end": 3556, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3557, "end": 3560, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3614, "end": 3618, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3619, "end": 3623, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3624, "end": 3628, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 433, "text": "Fig. 3.1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Immunofluorescence Techniques"}, {"text": "The combination of IF techniques with cell culture has increased the sensitivity of cell culture while providing a positive result in a shorter time period.

For some viruses, such as CMV or VZV, specific antibodies directed toward early or nonstructural antigens permit the rapid diagnosis within 48 h, well before CPE would be visualized under routine cell culture conditions [26, 27] .

This technique, pioneered by Coons [28] in 1942, has been used to study the structure and function of a variety of viral proteins and continues to be utilized in both the research and clinical laboratories. It has been used both for detection of viral infection of a monolayer prior to the appearance of cytopathic effect and in rapid screening assays for drug resistance [29, 30] . This method utilizes reagents similar to those used in the IF assay except that the fluorescent marker is replaced by an enzyme. When enzyme-specific substrates are provided, a colored precipitate forms at the site of reaction. Typical enzymes used to detect viral antigens include alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase. A major drawback of alkaline phosphatase-based reagents is their lack of stability; a major drawback of peroxidase as a marker is the fact that this enzyme is endogenous to some mammalian tissue, thus requiring either elimination of the endogenous enzyme or use of a nonmammalian enzyme, glucose oxidase [31] . Advantages of immunoenzymatic staining compared to IF staining include the virtual permanence of stained preparations and the ability to view slides using an ordinary light microscope. Both direct and indirect staining with immunoperoxidase and other enzymes have been utilized to detect many viruses. Refinements have been developed that allow even greater sensitivity than that seen with indirect staining without the need to conjugate enzyme to an antibody. For example, a modification of these techniques has been a fourlayer sandwich technique involving (1) virus-specific antibody raised in species X, (2) an excess amount of a second antibody raised against the species X antibody, (3) a complex of peroxidase and antiperoxidase antibody (raised in species X), and (4) reducing substrate for peroxidase [32] . The second antibody acts as a bridge, binding to both the virus and the antiperoxidase antibody. Similar unlabeled assay methods have been described for alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase and glucose oxidase-antiglucose oxidase [33, 34] . The sensitivity of antigen detection has been further improved by more recently developed signal amplification methods, including avidin-biotin complexes (binding of 4 biotins per streptavidin), chain polymer-conjugated technology where multiple enzyme and antibody molecules are attached to an inert molecule such as dextran, and the use of tyramine conjugates as substrates for horseradish peroxidase that allow signal amplication as much as 100-fold [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 489, "end": 493, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 494, "end": 497, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1139, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1956, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2202, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2206, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2666, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunocytochemical Staining"}, {"text": "Radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques have been valuable for the detection of many compounds in laboratories and clinical medicine.

Variations in RIA methods have been developed, with the most common being the direct and indirect solid-phase RIA. In the direct solid-phase RIA, antigen or antibody are captured on a solid support and detected by radiolabeled (usually 125 I) antibody or antigen, respectively.

The principal biological systems used for neutralization assays are tissue culture, embryonated chicken eggs, and adult and suckling mice [46] .

The detection of specific IgM antibody may be used to suggest a recent infection in a single serum specimen. Detection of specific IgM antibody in the neonate is useful to diagnose congenital infections, because maternal IgM antibody does not cross the placenta. IgM antibody also is useful to detect acute disease in a variety of other clinical situations, including infection with CMV, rubella, hepatitis A and B, and EBV.

The development of newer techniques, such as EIA, for antibody determination is replacing some of the older methods, such as complement fixation, but an understanding of the available methods is important prior to choosing a laboratory test to evaluate a specific question. Problems specific to serodiagnosis of a viral infection include the broad cross-reactivity among some virus groups, such as the coxsackie A viruses that cross-react with antibodies to coxsackie B and echoviruses. Another serious limitation of this approach to diagnosis is the failure of some individuals, particularly young children or immunocompromised patients, to mount a detectable antibody response to a specific infection.

The antibody titer is expressed as the highest serum dilution that neutralizes the test dose of virus. As a bioassay, neutralization assays are highly specific and quite sensitive. For many viral agents, the neutralizing antibody level is directly correlated with immunity, an important clinical and epidemiologic endpoint. Disadvantages of the assay include the time required to obtain a result and the relatively high cost, due to the labor intensity and requirement for cell culture and titered viral stocks. Neutralization assays may be carried out in a variety of systems and the endpoint measured by a number of different procedures. Different neutralization systems include plaque reduction neutralization, sometimes using complement enhancement, where the number of virus plaques in control wells are compared with the number seen in cultures inoculated with the virus-serum mixture; microneutralization, an assay performed in microtiter plates requiring small amounts of sera; and colorimetric assays. Colorimetric assays rely on markers indicating metabolic inhibition of the virus in cell cultures or on antigen-antibody reactions with antibody tagged or reacted with enzyme-linked antibodies. Colorimetric assays are generally analyzed by measurement of optical density and have the advantage of being less time-consuming and costly to set up and analyze than other assays. Colorimetric assays often are more sensitive than assays relying on inhibition of CPE [60] . The type of assay used to assess antibody is very important, particularly in the evaluation of susceptibility to vaccine-preventable or epidemic viruses such as measles or rubella, where low levels of antibody may be predictive of protection. Direct comparison of various laboratory methods used for the detection of virus-specific antibody may be important in designing studies or evaluating study results. For example, analysis of CMV antibody using neutralization by plaque reduction has shown poor correlation with CMV antibody using EIA [61] .

First developed in 1909 by Wasserman and coworkers [63, 64] for the detection of syphilis antibodies, CF has been adapted to test for antibodies to many bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals and man. The CF test relies on competition between two antigen-antibody systems for a fixed amount of complement, with the result ultimately demonstrated by the lysis of erythrocytes. The serum is heated at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate any complement that may be present. Antigen and a known amount of complement are added to dilutions of serum. The complexes formed between the initial antigen and antibody bind the available free complement, thus preventing further reaction of the complement in the second step of the assay. In the second step, a hemolytic indicator system using red blood cells (RBCs), which have been reacted with hemolysin to sensitize them to complement, is used to detect the free complement. The RBCs are reacted with hemolysin, or antibody to the RBC, and added to the assay. Lysis of the RBCs occurs if free complement is present. Thus, the presence of hemolysis at the conclusion of the assay is indicative of the absence of specific antibody, whereas the formation of clumped RBC (often referred to as a \"RBC button\") indicates a positive test reaction. Antibody titers can be calculated using standard endpoint determinations. Antibodies detected by CF are primarily of the IgG class and develop during the convalescent stages of illness. The greatest application of the CF test lies in the demonstration of a rise in antibody in convalescent compared with acute sera. The CF test has been widely used for the serodiagnosis of many human viral pathogens because of its broad reactivity and effectiveness in detecting changes in antibody titers and it is often the standard against which new methods are compared. The CF test has largely been replaced in many laboratories by enzyme immunoassays, but it continues to maintain its usefulness in some circumstances because reagents are relatively inexpensive and readily available and the test is rapid, reliable, and relatively easy to perform [65] . Another advantage of this assay is that many antigens can be easily tested in the same sera samples simply by changing the antigen but keeping all other reagents and conditions the same. The CF test is also adaptable to microtiter and automated methods. Despite the widespread use of the CF assay over time and in many epidemiologic studies, the assay has some unique problems: (1) the test relies on a cascade of interactions involving multiple biological reagents that must be carefully monitored; (2) it is relatively insensitive because high concentrations of antigen are required to produce CF complexes and the assay is unable to detect small changes in antibody concentrations or low levels of antibody that may be predictive of protection in other assay systems (such as VZV or measles) [66, 67] ; and (3) sera containing antibodies to host cell components or anti-complementary sera will not give a valid result.

While HAI may be used to identify an unknown virus with virus-specific antisera, it also is useful for the detection of virus-specific antibodies in the serum. HAI may be used to evaluate antibody titers of influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rubella, arboviruses, and some strains of picornaviruses and noroviruses [68, 69] . In this assay, serial dilutions of sera are allowed to react with a defined amount (4 HA units) of viral hemagglutinin. Subsequently, agglutinable RBCs are added and the ability of the virus to agglutinate the RBCs is measured. Properly treated sera containing antibody specific to the virus will prevent agglutination of the RBCs, resulting in formation of RBC buttons in the test wells; sera lacking specific antibody will result in RBC agglutination. Nonspecific viral inhibitors can give rise to false-positive results in some systems, requiring that the sera be properly prepared prior to use. The specificity of the assay varies somewhat with the particular virus, with influenza and parainfluenza virus systems being more specific than the arbovirus system [69] . For example, the HAI test can identify specific strains of influenza viruses, whereas it identifies only the group-specific antigens of the arboviruses (with neutralization tests required for strain identification). Advantages of the HAI assay are its simplicity, the low cost for reagents and equipment, and speed of the assay. Disadvantages of this assay include the fact that the system only works with those viruses that cause hemagglutination and that nonviral-specific serum components may also inhibit hemagglutination, thereby invalidating the test results. The immune adherence hemagglutination method is another method that has been used in the clinical laboratory. After an initial reaction between viral antigens and specific antibodies is allowed to occur, complement is added and binds to the antigen-antibody complex, if present. Human erythrocytes then are added and reaction to the antigen-antibody-complement complex with the C3b receptor causes hemagglutination. This method, commonly used as a microtiter procedure, has a well-defined endpoint and is rapid, inexpensive, and more sensitive than CF [70] .

The most commonly used immunoassays employ a fourlayer approach: antigen is bound directly to a surface, the unknown serum sample is then added, an enzyme-conjugated antihuman IgG or IgM is added next, and an indicator system is used to determine the amount of reaction between the enzyme-linked antibody and the antigen-serum reaction. As discussed in Sect. 5.5, this method has gained widespread use due to its sensitivity, specificity, safety, simplicity, low cost, and ability to be automated. The system lends itself to automation because of readily available microtiter diagnostic systems and because multiple tests for different antigens may be run by varying only the initial antigen in the system. Clinical specimens from various sources besides serum or plasma, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk, also may be tested in this system. The EIA test may also be read visually and so is useful in developing countries unable to afford the photometric reader used in developed countries to accurately quantitate the antibody content. Difficulties inherent in immunoassay techniques include those associated with obtaining and standardizing purified, sensitive, and specific IgG and IgM reagents. Although many of these reagents are commercially available, there can be variability in the specificity of the reagents so that during assay development the reagent specificity should be assessed.

Furthermore, analysis by immunoblot will not differentiate maternal from fetal HIV infection in many cases. Despite these problems, the immunoblot assay is widely used today in laboratories around the world as the \"definitive\" confirmatory test for HIV, and it is also used as a confirmatory test in some circumstances for the serological diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection [88] . It also has been used to differentiate type-specific serological responses to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 [89] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1122, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1509, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunoblot"}, {"text": "Virus infection is usually identified by either detection of the virus or identification of a serological response to the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Laboratory Tests"}, {"text": "For some viral infections, both are required. However, the interpretation of the viral diagnostic assays must be made in the context of the assay sensitivity and specificity along with seasonal, clinical, and other epidemiologic factors. Difficulties arise in interpretation of serological tests when only a single convalescent serum sample is obtained and a high antibody titer is found or if high titers are present in both acute and convalescent sera without a fourfold rise. These results can reflect either current infection or persistently high antibody levels from a previous infection. Significance may be attached to these findings if the disease is a rare one in which the presence of antibody is unique, if the test reflects a short-lasting antibody, or if specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody can be demonstrated. A rapid drop in antibody titer in a subsequent specimen is also suggestive of a recent infection. Sequential testing of other family members also may be useful, since they may be in different stages of apparent or inapparent infection with the same virus. In an epidemic setting, comparison of the geometric mean antibody titer of sera collected early in illness from one group of patients with that from another group of patients convalescing from the same illness may permit rapid identification of the outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interpretation of Laboratory Tests"}, {"text": "At times, a virus may be identified or an antibody rise demonstrated that is not, in fact, causally related to the illness.

Ultimately, the ideal diagnostic test will be rapid, easy to perform, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific and will not require the use of specialized equipment.

The change in the surface thickness is magnified through addition of a second virus-specific antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by addition of a substrate such as tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).
