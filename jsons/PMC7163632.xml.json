            "text": "\nSesbania is a genus of approximately 60 species of tropical legume of which 40 have so far been reported to nodulate (Sprent, 2001). Many species occur naturally in wet or flooded soils and these have considerable potential as green manure in wetland rice production due to their ability to fix large quantities of N2 (James et al., 2001 and references therein). Sesbania nodules may be induced by a variety of rhizobia, including Azorhizobium spp. (Dreyfus et al., 1988; Gon\u00e7alves and Moreira, 2004; Moreira et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008), Ensifer spp. (syn. Sinorhizobium spp.) (De Lajudie et al., 1994; 1998; Boivin et al., 1997; Chen and Lee, 2001; Sharma et al., 2005), Mesorhizobium spp. (McInroy et al., 1999; Bala et al., 2002; Odee et al., 2002; Vinuesa et al., 2005) and Rhizobium spp. (Rana and Krishnan, 1995; Wang et al., 1998; Wang and Mart\u00ednez\u2010Romero, 2000; Chen and Lee, 2001; Bala et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2005; Vinuesa et al., 2005). In addition to the \u2018standard\u2019 rhizobial types, strains of the genus Agrobacterium (which are now, rather controversially, included in the genus Rhizobium; Young et al., 2001; Farrand et al., 2003) have also been isolated frequently from Sesbania nodules (Tan et al., 2001; Bala et al., 2002; Odee et al., 2002). The present study concerns one of these, Rhizobium strain IRBG74, isolated from root nodules of Sesbania cannabina (Retz.) Pers. (Biswas et al., 2000). This strain has been used to promote the growth of rice, as one of a group of plant growth\u2010promoting rhizobacteria (Biswas et al., 2000). On the basis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence, it is most closely related to the plant pathogen Rhizobium radiobacter (syn Agrobacterium tumefaciens) (Tan et al., 2001). Biswas and colleagues (2000) tagged IRBG74, isolated from rice roots, with a gusA reporter gene and found that it not only expressed gus activity on plates containing X\u2010Gluc (5\u2010bromo\u20104\u2010chloro\u20103\u2010indolyl\u2010beta\u2010D\u2010glucuronic acid), but could also nodulate S. cannabina. Although plant growth was strongly promoted, both acetylene reduction and 15N isotope dilution assays found no activity associated with rice roots (Biswas et al., 2000). On the other hand, using both PCR and Southern hybridization, Tan and colleagues (2001) detected a nifH gene in IRBG74, one of the components required for nitrogenase production. Although some rhizobia occasionally express nitrogenase activity in culture, only the genus Azorhizobium (Dreyfus et al., 1988; Moreira et al., 2006) and some nodulating species of Burkholderia (Elliott et al., 2007) can grow on the products of nitrogen fixed ex planta. There are many reports of isolation of agrobacteria from nodules, but few have established whether or not these strains are capable of inducing nodules, and even if they can, whether or not the nodules are effective in fixing nitrogen.",

            "text": "The species R. radiobacter (Young et al., 2001) now includes the two former agrobacteria, Agrobacterium radiobacter (avirulent) and A. tumefaciens (tumour forming) (Willems, 2006). Although in the laboratory sym genes have been mobilized into R. radiobacter and the recipient strain was able to form N2\u2010fixing nodules on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1987), there is little published evidence that any Agrobacterium or Agrobacterium\u2010like strains can fix nitrogen in the wild, even if they induce nodulation (De Lajudie et al., 1999; Mhamdi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). Arguably the best evidence prior to the present study comes from recent work on two strains of the causal agent of hairy root disease, Rhizobium rhizogenes (syn. Agrobacterium rhizogenes), ATCC11325T and 163C, isolated from tumours on apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) and Prunus persica (L) Batsch respectively. These strains have been shown to harbour both sym and vir genes (Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2005). Moreover, the sym plasmid in both cases had nodD and nifH genes that were phylogenetically close to known bean symbionts, and the strains were able to produce tumours/hairy roots on tomato or nodules on common bean. However, although the bean plants accumulated significantly more N than uninoculated control plants without added N, the total N accumulated was half that of plants inoculated with Rhizobium etli CFN42, and there was no confirmation via either acetylene reduction assays (ARA) of nitrogenase activity or 15N\u2010based techniques that symbiotic N2 fixation was responsible for this N accumulation (Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2005).",

Finally, we compared the ability of all these bacteria to nodulate S. cannabina with that of IRBG74. The symbiotic properties (i.e. host range and nodA sequences) of IRBG74 and the other Sesbania symbionts are discussed in the context of a molecular phylogeny of Sesbania.",

To explore these phylogenetic relationships further, two housekeeping genes, fusA and rpoB, were included in a concatenated analysis of nine rhizobial strains for which the three sequences (i.e. 16S rRNA, fusA, rpoB) were available. These nine strains included three of R. radiobacter (NCIMB 9042, NCIMB 13307 and NCIMB 4034). From the inferred tree, IRBG74 clustered with a high bootstrap value (89%) with these three strains (Fig. S1), congruent with the 16S rRNA sequence analysis.",

To resolve this, DNA:DNA hybridization studies were carried out against strains of R. radiobacter (the type strain, NCIMB 9042, NCIMB 13307 and NCIMB 4034) plus the type strains of closely related organisms identified by the analysis using the three housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, fusA, rpoB). The degree of hybridization of IRBG74 to the R. radiobacter strains NCIMB 13307 and NCIMB 4034 was 57% and 44% respectively. Against type strains of R. rubi, R. vitis and R. huautlense, hybridizations were much lower (8%, 5% and 8% respectively). None of these values approached the upper threshold value (70%) for the definition of a bacterial species (Wayne et al., 1987). Moreover, strain IRBG74 did not form tumours on tobacco, and no virD2 or ipt gene homologues could be amplified by PCR, thus indicating the absence of the Ti plasmid. Therefore, these data support IRBG74 being placed within a species distinct from the other former Agrobacterium species now housed in the genus Rhizobium (Young et al., 2001).",

It is represented in the present study by strains Ss121 and Se127 isolated, respectively, from nodules of Sesbania sericea (Willd.) Link and S. exasperata growing in seasonally flooded regions of Venezuela (Vinuesa et al., 2005). The 16S rRNA sequence from another Rhizobium strain, SIN\u20101, originally isolated from S. bispinosa (Jacq.) W.F. Wight nodules by Rana and Krishnan (1995), suggested that it was also closely related to R. huautlense (Fig. 1).

Mesorhizobium huaukii strain KFR647, however, did not produce a PCR product for nodA despite nodulating S. cannabina and its original host, S. sesban (L) Merr. (Table 3, Fig. S4D). It did, however, produce a PCR product for nodD (GenBank accession number FJ514244), which was closest to other mesorhizobial strains, particularly Mesorhizobium loti. In the case of the azorhizobia, the nodA sequence of A. doebereinerae Br5401 (GenBank accession number FJ223128) was 95% similar to that of A. caulinodansORS571 (Lee et al., 2008), and neither of the Azorhizobium sequences clustered with any nodA sequences from the other known rhizobial genera.",

Burb., S. grandiflora (L) Pers., S. macrantha Welw. ex Phillips and Hutch., S. madagascariensis Du Puy and Labat and S. pachycarpa DC.), formed ineffective nodules on S. herbacea (Mill.)

Ineffective nodules were much smaller (< 2 mm in diameter), and white inside. Figure 2A\u2013F show that effective nodules had structures similar to those reported for other Sesbania spp. (Harris et al., 1949; Ndoye et al., 1994; James et al., 1996; 2001), i.e. the nodules had a central infected zone containing both infected and uninfected cells, an uninfected cortex with a ring of sclereid cells separating the inner and outer cortex, and a relatively transient meristem (Fig. 4C, and see the effective S. virgata nodule in Fig. S4A formed by A. doebereinerae Br5401), indicating an intermediate type of nodule between the classical determinate and indeterminate types (Ndoye et al., 1994; Den Herder et al., 2006). In contrast, the \u2018nodules\u2019 on S. rostrata, S. sesban and S. virgata (Fig. 2G and H) were root outgrowths formed at lateral root bases, and these contained no sign of infection within their central tissues.

IRBG74 wild\u2010type (WT) and glucuronidase (GUS)\u2010tagged strains was carried out under both flooded (Fig. 3) and non\u2010flooded conditions (Fig. 4). Plants were harvested at 7 and 15 dai and stained with X\u2010Gluc to detect the location of the bacteria on the roots. All four species examined, i.e. S. cannabina (Fig. 3A), S. bispinosa (Fig. 3B), S. rostrata (Fig. 3C) and S. sesban (Fig. 3D), showed clear evidence of root colonization by IRBG74GUS by 7 dai with particularly intense staining at lateral root junctions (e.g. Fig. 3A, C and D). Staining was also intense in the root hair zone close to root tips, even on S. bispinosa (Fig. 3B), which is known to be infected via cracks at lateral root junctions (Rana and Krishnan, 1995). Both WT and GUS\u2010tagged strains induced visible nodules on S. cannabina by 15 dai (Fig. 3E and F); the WT (control) strain showed no blue staining after treatment with X\u2010Gluc (Fig. 3F). Functional nodules were also formed on S. bispinosa by IRBG74GUS (not shown), but only small \u2018bumps\u2019 were formed on S. rostrata and S. sesban by 15 dai (as described previously for the WT strain; Fig. 2G and H). Under non\u2010flooded conditions, IRBG74 infected S. cannabina via root hairs (Fig. 4A and B), and nodule development thereafter was as described previously for other Sesbania spp., i.e. with the development of an apical meristem containing newly divided cells being penetrated by infection threads which \u2018released\u2019 bacteria into symbiosomes (Fig. 4C). These bacteria subsequently developed into bacteroids as the host cells expanded (Fig. 4C and D). Using an antibody raised against pea Lb (Fig. 4D), which had previously been shown to recognize Lb in N2\u2010fixing nodules on S. rostrata infected by A. caulinodans (James et al., 1996), nodules on S. cannabina infected by IRBG74 were shown to contain this O2\u2010carrying protein, which is essential for the functioning of the symbiosis. Functional nodules were not formed on either S. rostrata or S. sesban after inoculation by IRBG74 under non\u2010flooded conditions. However, there was clear evidence of infection of these species by IRBG74 in both root hairs and epidermal cells (Fig. 4E and F), with massive colonization of the \u2018nodule\u2019 and root surfaces by the bacteria, and even the formation of infection thread\u2010like structures within S. rostrata root hairs (Fig. 4E).",

Surprisingly, however, was the fact that A. doebereinerae strain Br5401, although it could not form effective N2\u2010fixing nodules on S. cannabina, was capable of promoting dry matter accumulation to a level equal to that of the symbiotically effective strains (Table 3), thus suggesting that it has plant growth\u2010promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) properties, although, it should be noted that at the time of harvest (30 days) the S. cannabina plants were showing symptoms of N\u2010deficiency (i.e. yellowing of the leaves). The plants inoculated with M. huakuii KFR647 showed highly variable nodulation ranging from no nodules through root bumps to partially effective nodules (Fig. S4D), and the mean dry weight accumulation was not significantly different to uninoculated S. cannabina (Table 3).",

Here, we repeated and extended the analyses of Tan and colleagues (2001) to include additional data (Fig. S1). A concatenated approach was deployed using two universally conserved protein\u2010coding genes, rpoB and fusA, which are useful alternatives to 16S rRNA sequences in determining the relationship between both divergent and highly related lineages (Santos and Ochman, 2004). The phylogenetic tree derived from the concatenated sequence matrix under a maximum likelihood approach offered the opportunity to infer a phylogeny based on the total evidence, from which the underlying species tree could be estimated. This tree supports the phylogeny estimated from the 16S rRNA sequence, namely that strain IRBG74 clusters, with high bootstrap support (89%), with three validly described strains of R. radiobacter, including the type strain NCIMB9042. However, the inferred tree does not identify whether IRBG74 is a strain of R. radiobacter or a unique species. To accomplish this, DNA\u2013DNA hybridization, which remains the \u2018gold standard\u2019 to differentiate between these alternatives, was used. Our data demonstrated that against closely related strains of the Rhizobium genus, the DNA\u2013DNA similarity was greatest against two strains of R. radiobacter, NCIMB9042, and NCIMB4034 (a recently described strain that has been used as a PGPR in agricultural systems; Humphry et al., 2007), although neither of these strains is diazotrophic. Nevertheless, the similarity was significantly lower than the 70% threshold (Wayne et al., 1987) required for designating IRBG74 as a strain of R. radiobacter or, indeed, any of the other species examined. These observations therefore support the inclusion of IRBG74 as a novel species within the R. radiobacter\u2013R. rubi clade, and, to our knowledge, is the first N2\u2010fixing bacterium to be identified from among these species. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, because there are potential issues (which have yet to be resolved) in using DNA hybridization to circumscribe bacterial species in isolates with large accessory genomes (Young et al., 2006). Moreover, this study was on a single strain (i.e. IRBG74), and several strains should be studied before a robust species description can be developed.",

Alignment of the nifH and nodA sequences against homologous genes in GenBank revealed that both were most closely related to homologues present in members of the genus Ensifer, particularly those that had been isolated from Sesbania spp. The nifH gene of IRBG74 showed highest similarity to homologues from E. saheli strain ORS609 (also isolated from S. cannabina; De Lajudie et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997), whereas the nodA gene sequence was most similar to those of E. saheli bv. sesbaniae strain ORS611 and E. terangae bv. sesbaniae (although it did also hybridize with the nodA gene from E. saheli ORS609). The other Rhizobium strains isolated from Sesbania nodules (Ss121, Se127, SIN\u20101 and DUS1110) also contained nifH and nodA genes that were very similar to those of the Ensifer symbionts, and a phylogenetic relationship between the nifH genes of Rhizobium symbionts of Sesbania and those of E. saheli was previously noted by Vinuesa and colleagues (2005). It therefore appears that although the core genome of IRBG74 is essentially \u2018agrobacterial\u2019, its accessory symbiosis\u2010related genome is similar to that of a wide range of Rhizobium/Ensifer Sesbania symbionts.",

This phenomenon is most likely explained by the high mobility of the plasmid\u2010borne genes in Rhizobium and close relatives such as Ensifer (Turner et al., 2002; Bailly et al., 2007). In the case of Agrobacterium, this mobility has been exemplified in laboratory experiments in which strains have had rhizobial sym plasmids mobilized into them, and the genetically modified Agrobacterium strains thus formed have consequently shown a limited ability to nodulate legumes (Hirsch et al., 1985; Mart\u00ednez et al., 1987; Van de Wiel et al., 1988). Interestingly, and in spite of the apparent ease with which Agrobacterium can acquire sym genes in the laboratory, fully effective N2\u2010fixing agrobacterial symbioses with legumes had not been demonstrated and/or discovered (Mhamdi et al., 2005; Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) until the present study of strain IRBG74, which is therefore the first confirmed naturally occurring agrobacterial symbiont of legumes to be fully described in both genetical and symbiotic terms.",

There appears to be no obvious geographical link between those species that do nodulate and those that do not, other than that all of the Asian Sesbania spp. nodulated effectively. Indeed, our data suggest that symbiotically effective N2 fixation is observed only with those species that can also nodulate with Rhizobium or Ensifer. Host range in rhizobia is determined by \u2018decorations\u2019 on the structure of the lipoprotein oligosaccharide \u2018nod factors\u2019 transcribed by the nodulation genes, such as nodA (Sprent, 2001; Kobayashi and Broughton, 2008), and so it is likely that the host range of IRBG74 (and the other symbionts in this study) is reflected more in its nodA than its core genome phylogeny. The nodA phylogenies suggest that the Rhizobium isolates studied here have acquired their symbiosis\u2010related genes by lateral gene transfer from an Ensifer sp. (Fig. 3B), with a potential candidate being E. saheli. In the case of IRBG74, this is further supported by the fact that the type strain of E. saheli, ORS609, which was originally isolated from S. cannabina (De Lajudie et al., 1994), has a similar host range (e.g. it is capable of effectively nodulating many of the Sesbania species tested positive in the present study for symbiotic nodulation with IRBG74, such as S. bispinosa, S. formosa, S. grandiflora and S. pachycarpa; Boivin et al., 1997). On the other hand, unlike ORS609 (Boivin et al., 1997), strain IRBG74 was unable to form effective nodules with those Sesbania spp. that establish symbiotic partnerships with azorhizobia (S. rostrata, S. virgata; Table 3) and mesorhizobia (S. punicea, S. sesban), thus suggesting that although they share similarities in their nodA sequences, the nod genes of IRBG74 are not identical to those of ORS609.",

Unfortunately, the sequence of nodA from KFR647 could not be obtained, but its nodD gene sequence was different from the aforementioned Ensifer\u2010Rhizobium clade, and the nodA sequence of M. plurifarium Sp45, which only forms ineffective nodules on S. cannabina, was also distant from this clade, thus lending support to the suggestion that S. cannabina has a preference for Ensifer/Rhizobium symbionts with plasmid\u2010borne symbiosis\u2010related genes. On the other hand, S. cannabina may not be typical in this respect, as other studies of Sesbania have demonstrated that both mesorhizobial and (sino)rhizobial symbionts are found within the same species, e.g. in S. sericea (Vinuesa et al., 2005) and S. sesban (Bala et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2005). Of the two species that are known to nodulate with Azorhizobium, S. rostrata appears to be more capable of forming effective symbioses with other rhizobia (such as E. saheli and E. terangae; De Lajudie et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997), than S. virgata, which seems to be capable of forming effective symbioses only with A. doebereinerae (Gon\u00e7alves and Moreira, 2004; this study). Sesbania punicea also appears to be highly conservative in its choice of symbiont, as evidenced by the lack of nodulation with IRBG74 (this study) or even with the other mesorhizobial strain from S. sesban, M. huakuii KFR647 (E.K. James, unpubl. data), and the data so far obtained about this species suggest that it can nodulate only with M. plurifarium (Vinuesa et al., 2005). Interestingly, the highly selective nature of S. virgata and S. punicea with regard to symbionts in comparison with other Sesbania spp. was illustrated by a rhizobial soil \u2018trapping\u2019 study in Brazil in which they were the only Sesbania spp. that failed to nodulate in uninoculated soils (Veasey et al., 1997). In contrast, good nodulation was obtained with the relatively more promiscuous S. exasperata, S. sesban and S. tetraptera Hochst. ex Baker.",

However, the crack entry infection process via adventitious roots that leads to the initial formation of aerial stem nodules on S. rostrata has also been observed in flooded roots of this species (Ndoye et al., 1994; Goormachtig et al., 2004) and S. bispinosa (Rana and Krishnan, 1995), and it also probably occurs on the other hydrophytic Sesbania spp. regardless of the type of rhizobial symbiont. The present study of Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) sp. IRBG74 suggests that a crack entry infection probably occurs with S. cannabina under flooded conditions, whereas under non\u2010flooded conditions, as in S. rostrata (Goormachtig et al., 2004), it nodulates via a \u2018standard\u2019 root hair infection pathway. It remains to be seen if the other Sesbania spp. in this study also switch from crack entry under flooded conditions to root hair infection under the non\u2010flooded conditions described by Goormachtig and colleagues (2004) for S. rostrata. However, given that the subsequent nodule development and structure of N2\u2010fixing Sesbania nodules is so distinctive and uniform across the genus (this study, Harris et al., 1949; Dreyfus and Dommergues, 1981; Ndoye et al., 1994; Boivin et al., 1997; James et al., 2001), it is possible that all the hydrophytic species share common strategies in terms of rhizobial infection.",

Although this is by no means the first report of a non\u2010pathogenic Agrobacterium strain being isolated from nodules (e.g. Mhamdi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006), the fact that IRBG74 possesses a sym\u2010plasmid with symbiosis\u2010specific genes (e.g. nodA) and can effectively nodulate its original host and fix N2 to the benefit of the growth of the plant to the same degree as \u2018conventional\u2019 rhizobia, is a novel observation. Indeed, it could be argued that despite its core genome being that of Agrobacterium (Tan et al., 2001; this study), IRBG74 behaves in all respects (including its infection processes) like typical legume\u2010nodulating rhizobia, and thus supports the recent decision to incorporate all Agrobacterium strains into the genus Rhizobium (Young et al., 2001). It is likely that as further rhizobia are isolated from more legumes, particularly those in the tropics, the incidence of potentially genuine symbiotic \u2018Agrobacterium\u2019 isolates will increase (e.g. see Bala et al., 2002).",

            "text": "This is also the first study to compare a nodulation gene (in this case, nodA) within a range of Sesbania symbionts. The nodA gene phylogeny, which groups the bacteria into three distinct clades (ie. Azorhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium[Agrobacterium]/E. saheli), also appears linked to these microsymbionts' host range. Indeed, the present study, together with data from previous published work, have indicated three definable \u2018groups\u2019 of Sesbania spp. in terms of their propensity to nodulate with symbionts harbouring particular nodA gene types. Groups 1 and 2 consist of only one species each, i.e. the two South American species, S. punicea and S. virgata, which both have a high specificity for a very narrow range of symbionts (M. plurifarium and A. doebereinerae respectively) harbouring nodA sequences that are very different from each other and from the other Sesbania symbionts examined in the present study. Group 3, on the other hand, is a large group that contains several non\u2010selective (\u2018promiscuous\u2019) species that can nodulate with a wide range of symbionts in the Rhizobium[Agrobacterium]/E. saheli clade harbouring similar nodA genes (as well as, in some cases, with M. huakuii and A. caulinodans). The species in Group 3 include S. cannabina and S. sesban, and given their ability to nodulate effectively with strain IRBG74 (this study) and/or S. saheli ORS609 (Boivin et al., 1997), probably also include S. exasperata, S. formosa, S. grandiflora, S. macrantha and S. pachycarpa. This group also includes S. herbacea, the original source of R. huautlense (Wang et al., 1998), but which can also nodulate with Mesorhizobium strains and IRBG74 (Wang and Mart\u00ednez\u2010Romero, 2000; this study), and S. sericea, which, along with S. cannabina and S. exasperata, nodulates with R. huautlense strains (Vinuesa et al., 2005). Although both the Group 1 and 2 species are South American in origin, the three nodulation groups appear to be independent of geography, as other South America spp. are present in Group 3 (e.g. S. exasperata) and, indeed, the Group 3 species come from all parts of the tropical world. This therefore leaves open the possibility that the nodulation preferences (and nodA types) are actually linked to plant phylogeny, and this is demonstrated by a tree inferred from nrDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 and 2 sequences of several Sesbania spp., including all those used in the present study (Fig. 5). This preliminary study has shown that although the genus is monophyletic (F.T. Farruggia, unpublished), it contains two distinct clades that appear to match the symbiont preference/nodA groups described above. For example, both the selective species, S. punicea and S. virgata, are present in one of the clades, whereas all the promiscuous species and/or those species that can nodulate with IRBG74 and other members of the Rhizobium[Agrobacterium]/E. saheli nodA group of Sesbania symbionts are in the other clade. Further studies of nod genes of symbionts from other members of the 60 plus species in the genus should confirm if the heterogeneity in symbiont preference is, indeed, linked to the molecular phylogeny of Sesbania.",

The plants were grown under sterile flooded conditions in glass tubes (as for the experiment using the GUS\u2010tagged IRBG74 strain; see above). The plants were harvested at 60 dai, and were scored for presence of nodules, plant health (i.e. green shoots), ARA and nodule structure.
