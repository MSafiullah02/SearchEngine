Cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock have also been reported, with associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In another study from China, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) were more likely to exhibit elevation of troponin-T (TnT) levels (n = 36, 54.5%) compared with patients without CVD (n = 16, 13.2%). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels developed complications more frequently, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 30, 57.7% vs. n = 16, 11.9%), malignant arrhythmias (n = 6, 11.5% vs. n = 7, 5.2%) including ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, acute coagulopathy (n = 25, 65.8% vs. n = 17, 20.0%), and acute kidney injury (n = 14, 36.8% vs. n = 4, 4.7%), compared with those with normal TnT levels [3] .",

Besides myocardial infarction and heart failure, arrhythmias are generally one of the three major risks associated with viral infections, due to myocarditis, proinflammatory effects, and an increased sympathetic stimulation.

Arrhythmias may be attributed to direct myocardial injury or occur secondary to metabolic derangement, hypoxia, neurohormonal changes, or inflammatory stress in the setting of acute viremia. However, a malignant arrhythmia in the setting of elevated cardiac markers should raise suspicion of underlying myocarditis. Given that hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities that are common in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown. Improved understanding of this is critical, primarily in guiding decisions on whether additional arrhythmia monitoring is needed (e.g., mobile cardiac telemetry) after discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or wearable cardioverter defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought to be secondary to COVID-19.",

            "text": "It is unclear which medications may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Off-label use of some medications is currently being investigated. While no specific treatment is recommended, safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may be requested from electrophysiology (EP) providers. Hydroxychloroquine is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause druginduced long-QT syndrome [5] . The clinical arrhythmic toxicity (syncope and torsade de pointes) is largely limited to chronic use (due to the agent's long half-life of 40 days), use of multiple concomitant QT-prolonging medications (e.g., azithromycin), metabolic derangements, renal failure, or in the setting of an acute overdose. To date, HCQ has been widely tolerated in most populations as an antimalarial medication and is safely used in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus populations without electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Because the proposed HCQ therapy for COVID-19 is relatively short (e.g., 5-10 days), the risk of arrhythmic toxicity is likely quite low. There are specific precautions to be considered for select patients, however; patients with known congenital long-QT syndrome and patients with severe renal insufficiency should have the dose reduced (50% for CrCl <10 ml/min), whereas patients on QT-prolonging drugs and electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) should have these conditions corrected prior to use, with regular monitoring.",
