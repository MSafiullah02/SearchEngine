Drawing on distinctions between simulation, ritual, and play, it shows that the engagement of actors in the imaginary of simulations, which they describe as 'realism', reflectively reverses the oppositions between humans and nonhumans, active and passive, fiction and reality that shape ordinary life. Borrowing from the anthropology of hunting societies, it argues that simulations of bird diseases, considered as signs of future species extinction, rely on cynegetic techniques of power, in which humans and animals symmetrically shift perspectives, and not only on pastoralist techniques, in which humans are above the population they monitor and sometimes sacrifice.",

The stated objective of these exercises is to 'rehearse' a disaster situation in order to better prepare for it (Armstrong 2012). Actors in a simulation treat the expected disaster as if it had happened in order to immerse themselves in the reality it should produce (Seligman, Weller, Puett & Simon 2008). As such, simulations offer opportunities for social anthropology to combine science and technology studies with the ethnography of rituals. Enacting the imaginary of coming catastrophes, simulation creates an extraordinary setting for performances separated from ordinary life.",

Both techniques use worst-case scenarios, written by disaster-management professionals trained in fiction writing. If simulation is a regular activity for scientists working on computers, it also shapes the stage of extraordinary performances for ordinary citizens involved in drills (Sismondo 1999). However, the distinction between these two forms of simulation is not between reality and fiction, since those who write scenarios for these two kinds of simulation constantly play on the shift between virtual and actual. They rely on the memory of previous catastrophes and the anticipation of future disasters to inform a realistic engagement in the present of the simulation. If scenarios are considered as shared forms or schemes",

Influenza viruses emerging from birds have been considered as potentially causing future pandemics, because birds (particularly waterfowl in south China) have been identified as the reservoir in which flu viruses mutate before spreading successfully between humans (Shortridge & Stuart-Harris 1982) . Among other techniques such as early warning systems and stockpiling vaccines, preparing for the next pandemics therefore involves simulating the transmission of pathogens from birds to humans (Caduff 2015; Lakoff 2007) . Arguing that a human pandemic is a symmetrical threat to the extinction of a bird species, I then consider another bird disease for which Chinese experts organize simulations: botulism. This disease, which doesn't affect humans, is considered a potential disaster for black-faced spoonbills because it kills migratory birds when they concentrate in wetlands on their flyways (Wilson 2010: 76) .",

Global health has been extended to animals and the environmentan approach called 'One World, One Health' -thus requiring an interspecies approach towards the ethical issues involved (Hinchliffe 2015) . One of the most debated questions in the anthropology of pandemic preparedness is the adequacy of the notion of sacrifice to describe how some populations are separated from others and killed or left to die for the sake of public health. In exercises of triage, some patients are prioritized over others through the framework of urgency (Nguyen 2010; Redfield 2013) . In the management of human populations, migrant workers are considered as a threat by educated experts using viral connectivity as a metaphor of modernity (MacPhail 2014; Mason 2016) . In the management of zoonotic pathogens, the notion of sacrifice seems even more obvious, since animals are massively killed to eradicate the reservoir of emerging infectious diseases; and in the management of wild animals, some individuals are sacrificed to protect the species (Van Dooren 2014). Other descriptions, however, have been proposed of the entangled relations between animals and humans in the 'hotspots' or 'sentinel devices' where emerging pathogens connect them in productive ways (Brown & Kelly 2014; Fearnley 2015; Keck & Lakoff 2013; Lezaun & Porter 2015; Lowe 2010) . While sacrifice separates some living beings from others to eradicate pathogens, sentinels instantiate relations between living beings through the anticipation of future pathogens.",

But they don't take the perspective of animals because they consider simulations as pastoral techniques of biopower, therefore bypassing what the anthropology of hunting societies shows about ritual action. In this article, I define a cynegetic practice of simulation that is always mixed with forms of planning, combining two different forms of anticipation. I call 'avian preparedness' this mix of cynegetic becoming-animal and pastoralist care for populations initiated by microbiologists, considered both as 'virus hunters' (Perrey 2012 ) and as 'microbe farmers' (Caduff 2015: 76) .",

Pandemic or extinction scenarios, I argue, connect humans and animals in realistic ways to play on the imagination of what could happen if a pathogen emerges. Using animal reservoirs as mirrors in which anxieties about pandemics are reflected, humans exchange their perspectives with animals in an imagined future where their relations are reversed. Simulations can thus be situated in an anthropological space between play and ritual. Roberte Hamayon (2015: 97) has called 'simulation' the way shamans in Mongolian hunting societies imitate the movements of animals in a ritualized setting to prepare for the uncertainties of hunting. In an article entitled 'Dissimulation and simulation as forms of religious reflexivity' , Michael Houseman proposes to move away from a definition of ritual as a collective action based on a shared secret to study 'the emergent properties of ritual simulation generally ' (2002: 77) . He draws on two cases taken from hunting societies of Central Africa, one in which male novices are symbolically killed and the other in which a goat is actually sacrificed. He asks: how do participants come to believe in a series of speeches and actions -the novice's death and the goat's consent to sacrifice -that are obviously false? He answers that ritual action creates an extraordinary space of reflexivity with regard to the ordinary relations that constitute the group. While the ritual for male novices is a 'dissimulation' , in which the relations between initiated and uninitiated are constantly reversed in such a way that the moment of death becomes uncertain, the ritual of goat sacrifice, says Houseman, is a simulation of consent, in which the silencing of the goat through the consumption of herbs mimics the consent of male hunters to their initiation. The ritual is reflexive in the sense that it stages the condition of the ritual itself -the secrecy known by initiators and unknown by the initiatedthrough the manipulations of daily relations between humans and nonhumans, whose asymmetries are reflected as in a mirror.",

As hubs for the intense circulation of persons and commodities in Asia, but also as repositories of Chinese traditional relations between humans and birds, they have prepared for the catastrophic effects of a bird flu outbreak. But while the Hong Kong government regularly culls its poultry and sends warning signals from the Chinese border, Taiwan and Singapore rarely had to cull their poultry and rather invested in scenarios for the simulation of pandemic.

By looking at the relations between humans and birds in these three contexts through their common exposure to emerging pathogens, this article also analyses the relations between national states in Asia as they have to manage a common disaster. Since simulations of bird diseases connect relations at different scales, from the microbiological to the biopolitical, this article combines science studies, ethnography of rituals, and political economy through an anthropology of 'more-than-human' relations (Helmreich & Kirksey 2010; Kohn 2013; Sagan 2011) .",

Gavin then moved to Singapore in 2012, where he had more freedom to continue his fundamental research, and more funding from international institutions. He had shifted from the sentinel post, where the new strains of avian influenza emerged, such as the H5N1 virus in 1997 (Keck 2010) , to a place where he could simulate the evolution of flu viruses in high-tech computers.

It showed that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated among pigs and humans as early as 1911, thus challenging the commonly held view that Spanish flu jumped from birds to humans in 1918. In the context of the new H1N1 'swine flu' , this article stressed the need for intensified surveillance of pigs to detect emerging flu viruses before they become pandemic. 'If future pandemics arise in this manner' , Gavin and his team concluded, 'this interval may provide the best opportunity for health authorities to intervene to mitigate the effects of a pandemic or even to abort its emergence' (Smith, Bahl, Vijaykrishna, et al. 2009: 11712) .",

This software, called BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) or MSA (Multiple Sequence Analysis), calculates the probability that genetic sequences derive from one another.

In the construction of a phylogenetic tree, biological knowledge is necessary because some correlations proposed by the computer make no sense in an evolutionary perspective, as they can be due to errors in sequencing or genetic deletion. To decide which correlations to take into account and which to consider as irrelevant, virologists use other software (such as Bootstrap, Jukes Cantor, or Tamura) providing the probability of correlations based on a given scenario. As for other techniques of preparedness, probability is not enough to simulate a coming disaster: it requires a work of imagination (Lakoff 2007) . Peter Galison has shown that computer simulation emerged in the field of particle physics as a 'subculture' among experimenters and theoreticians under the 'Monte Carlo' programme funded by NASA in the 1960s to simulate a nuclear explosion. Simulation replaces experimentation when the data needed for the theory are too numerous and complex to be processed with traditional instruments, creating a 'trading zone' in which different professional groups share a common language or 'pidgin' (Galison 1997: 50) . Similarly, bioinformatics produces new images shared by microbiologists, computer scientists, and public health executives in the anticipation of epidemics. Software such as Bootstrap can be considered as an accessory or decoy to trap the live bird viruses through the sequences that have been stored in Genbank.",

Make a tree so big you can never print it on a sheet of paper: it will be good starting material before reducing the inquiry' . Gavin and his team explained that in contrast to other virologists working on flu viruses, they had decided to use the eight segments of the virus's RNA, 2 not just the two segments that shape the H and N proteins, usually considered to be the most significant markers of antigen evolution. They could thus build eight parallel evolutionary trees which, by their similarities, gave an indication of the real evolution of the whole flu virus. There was nothing secret in the images of pandemic viruses built by these microbiologists, unlike simulations of nuclear explosions built indoors by particle physicists (Gusterson 1996) : all the phylogenetic trees produced by Gavin and his team were publicly available on websites.",

Gavin said that when a virus jumps from one species to another, it inaugurates a new set of lines, as the 'immunity pressure' of the environment creates an 'evolutionary bottleneck' in which this mutation can replicate. Drawing back these lines then lead him to what he named 'The Most Recent Common Ancestor' . 'I love those trees' , he added.

But I was mostly intrigued by the way Gavin and his team turned sequences into images through an anticipatory mode of reasoning that I call 'reverse scenario' . Natasha Schull proposes the term in her work with on-line gamblers, to describe the way they 'cope with the necessarily uncertain futures of any hand by returning them to a point in the past and confronting them with a branching diversity of outcomes that might have emerged from it' (2015: 56). It applies well to the practices of 'virus hunters' who use 'reverse engineering' to reconstruct potentially pandemic pathogens such as the 1918 H1N1 virus (Caduff 2015: 105; Napier 2003: 2) . Just as a gambler speculates how much he could have won if he had played this or that card, Gavin imagines what could have happened if the H1N1 virus had been detected in pigs prior to 1918 or 2009. Virus sequencing allows him to trace potential connections between birds, pigs, and humans, and to imagine other futures of cross-species transmission. Yet we don't know how birds (and pigs) are actually involved in the construction of pandemic scenarios, because we don't see how virologists take virus samples from birds. We thus need to turn from desktop simulations to 'real-ground' exercises organized by public health officials and birdwatchers.",

'There are 50 million passengers every year at Singapore Changi Airport' , he told me, 'so there is a high probability that emerging infectious diseases will come to Singapore. We need to be prepared' . During the SARS crisis in 2003, he said, 238 people were infected by the new coronavirus, with thirty-three deaths. They were all treated at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which had been designated by the government as an isolation hospital for SARS patients. At the peak of the crisis, all schools in the country were closed for ten days, and home quarantine was established for more than 6,000 people known to have come into close contact with a SARS-infected person. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said publicly that SARS could possibly become the worst crisis Singapore had faced since independence. When a journalist asked him if he was being alarmist, Goh responded: 'Well, I think I'm being realistic because we do not quite know how this will develop. This is a global problem and we are at the early stage of the disease' (Zolli 2012) .",

Mr Wong was a former policeman in charge of organizing exercises for emerging infectious diseases in hospitals. The first national exercise for influenza in Singapore was organized in 2006, after the first cases of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 were suspected in Thailand. Called 'Sparrowhawk' , it was organized in two stages: a table-top discussion and assessment of pandemic response plans among six hospitals in the country between April and June; and a practical exercise on 21-2 July, in which the six designated hospitals had to manage potential patients and share information about their circulation. Mr Wong explained that a thousand people were involved in the real-ground drill, mostly volunteers from grassroots organizations and nurses from training institutions. While patients moved from one hospital to another, some hospitals assessed the behaviour of others and gradually raised the number of casualties. The main question, according to Mr Wong, was: 'If there are 200 casualties in one hospital, which resources do they need?'",

To explain the improvement between 'Sparrowhawk' exercises in 2006 and 2008 in Singapore, an official leaflet notes, 'The exercises were activated unannounced to inject greater realism. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Staff turned up without prior justification at the general ward of the exercise hospital and \"triggered\" the simulated case of human infection with avian influenza' (UNSIC 2008: 56) .

On 17 July 2013, the Agriculture and Veterinary Authority (AVA) organized a drill in one of the poultry slaughterhouses on the border with Malaysia. There are no authorized poultry farms on the territory and only five chicken farms for eggs, which constrains Singapore to import and slaughter 40 million live chickens from Malaysia every year.

The scenario for the exercise was the following: 1,500 chickens had been infected with H5N1 and should be killed and destroyed, according to emergency response plans. About 100 employees of the slaughterhouse, mostly Indians, had to be screened for their temperature, take an antiviral drug, and then wear personal protective equipment (boots, cap, mask, glasses, gloves) on the back of which their name was written. The 'affected' chickens were placed in green cages on belts, immersed in water, and electrocuted. Their cadavers were then placed inside two layers of biohazard bags to be incinerated. Dr Yap Him Ho, Director of the Quarantine and Inspection Group, declared on television, 'To make sure that AVA is prepared for any incursion, the main thing we want to do for this exercise is to train our officers, as well as the other parties that are involved in the contingency planning, to be familiar with the steps of the procedures' (Straits Times 2013).",

I was also intrigued by the fact that while the Hong Kong government organized many such exercises on the human side, they had never simulated bird flu in poultry farms, because outbreaks occurred regularly in farms on its territory. While Singapore authorities actually killed poultry for a disease that remained virtual, Hong Kong authorities simulated the transmission of bird flu from chickens to humans because it was already circulating among birds.

Rather, simulations display openly contradictions that public health administrations have to solve, often by the use of sacrifice in operations of culling (of infected poultry) or triage (of suspected patients). They create a tension between two techniques of power: those of biologists and simulators who follow viruses as they mutate between species, which I describe as cynegetic, and those of public health officials who have to protect some populations against others, which I call pastoral. To support this hypothesis, I will now turn to simulations organized by birdwatchers.

Species that fly from Japan and Korea to Australia, along what came to be called the East Asian-Australian flyway, have been shown to have declined owing to the urbanization and development of the Chinese coast. Climate change is also supposed to damage the places where wild birds feed and roost on their migratory routes. Among the bird species affected by these changes, one of the most charismatic is the black-faced spoonbill, a waterbird breeding in Japan and Korea in the summer and migrating to south China in the winter. In the 1990s, the number of these birds was estimated to be 2,000, but thanks to the conservation efforts shared by the countries to which they migrate, it increased to 3,000 at the end of the 2000s. Wetlands have been developed in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Fujian as shelters on their flyways. Images of spoonbills abound in schools, environmental agencies, and natural reserves, often portrayed as funny birds smiling to the public. To understand how reverse scenarios of disasters enter the management of spoonbills in China, we have to go beyond these anthropomorphic images, and look at how they actually perform in simulations.",

The Wild Bird Society of Tainan consequently organized a campaign to vaccinate spoonbills against botulism, and used decoys to train their staff on how to safely handle the birds. Since then, drills have been regularly organized for bird protectors to learn how to manipulate fake spoonbills with caution. These decoys are also used to attract spoonbills for GPS monitoring. Carved in wood and painted in black and white, they are posted in the wetlands close to traps. Decoys are different from images of spoonbills on posters: wildlife managers interact with them as if they were alive, because of their accurate mimicking.",

By contrast with lures, which attract birds based on their appetites, decoys attribute intentions to prey (Schaeffer 1999: 64) . In England, duck decoys take the form of pondside wooden houses into which ducks are attracted by a fake dog, because hunters have observed that ducks swim towards the dog to signal that it has been seen. In the same way, the fake spoonbill is used as a decoy because it creates a situation of communication with the bird. But at the same time, the fake spoonbill is used as a dummy by birders who train to manipulate spoonbills in risky situations, as in epidemic simulations. The use of spoonbill decoys mixes hunting techniques and pastoral techniques because decoys are considered both as intentional agents and as objects that should be manipulated with care.",

Birdwatchers had found shelter in a Taoist temple on the banks of the marshes, and they turned on some Buddhist music to soothe the birds. With very calm gestures, a man equipped with gloves and a mask sewed a GPS satellite tracking device around the waist of the spoonbill, while a woman held it gently but firmly. Five other birdwatchers watched them with amusement, taking pictures and making comments on the bird's reactions. The man explained to me that he had to be cautious because it was a young spoonbill, so the weight of the satellite tracking device had to be imposed on its body in such a way that it would not hamper its growth or unbalance its flight. How to build techniques of monitoring that do not kill animals considered as indexes of the fate of their species is a major concern for wildlife managers, who often talk about the sacrifice of individual animals when they die as the result of an improper monitoring device (Benson 2011) . But Taiwanese birdwatchers focused the discussion on how to properly release these birds so that they would not be sacrificed but become sentinels of a threatened species.",

In Hong Kong and Taiwan, Buddhist associations entered into discussion with birdwatching societies because many birds were found dead after they were bought in bird markets and released in surrounding natural parks. These associations had to warn through posters that releasing birds could cause the death of birds, because they were released in an improper environment, and the death of humans, since some of the birds found dead after the release carried avian flu (Severinghaus & Chi 1991) .",

While the ritual introduced the bird into a cycle of life and death, the simulation used the decoy to produce signs of future threats for birds and humans. The black-faced spoonbills were released in the Taijiang National Park with the hope that they would fly over to Hong Kong or the Fujian coast, where their signals could be captured. It should be noted that the Taiwan Straits are also the sites of military exercises or drills through which threats coming from China are mitigated. To prepare for an attack from the People's Republic of China, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control was organizing exercises simulating the use of bioweapons in a public space, such as SARS, smallpox, and avian flu virus (Rollet 2010: 311) . The release of a black-faced spoonbill in the same Chinese straits mimics and reverses the scenario of an avian flu outbreak from China. Instead of carrying information on the potential war between two long-term enemies, it produces signals on the changes of bird habitats that concern birds as well as humans. While in the public health simulations birds are considered as carriers of infectious diseases, birdwatchers' simulations frame them as living beings with which humans share pathogens as signs of communication.",

Huge amounts of money (an estimated US$2 billion) are spent in bets on those which will return, welcomed as heroes if they are first, killed if they are too slow. 4 This is neither a ritual nor a simulation but a gambling practice through which birds crossing the sea between China and Taiwan are qualified as political signifiers. The reverse scenario of the game, producing strange identifications between humans and birds, tells the story of a pigeon successfully returning home while others fail and die in the Taiwan Straits.",

These three types of simulation displace the problem of sacrifice: that is, the definition of those who deserve to live and those who will die. Microbiological surveillance of viruses moves away from the site of emergence where birds are killed to prevent the spread of pathogens to humans, and traces continuities between humans and animals as a reservoir where viruses silently mutate. Simulations of epidemics don't address the problem of triage between humans in a situation of exception, but rather configure new relations between humans and animals through accessories in a performance. Exercises of vaccinating and releasing potentially sick birds don't raise the issue of how many birds can die for the sake of the species, but rather reflect on how to handle a bird with care in a political environment where they carry signals of threat. In the reverse scenarios of simulations, birds appear not as sources of infection that must be eradicated, but as sentinels with which humans can communicate to imagine potential futures.",

The use of computer software, accessories, and decoys in the three types of simulations I have analysed blurs the sharp opposition between humans and nonhumans. These objects can be considered as decoys because they carry the intentions that humans attribute to animals and shift their perception from inanimate objects to living beings. While scenarios of bird-generated epidemics play on the asymmetries between humans and birds, the horizon of the simulation (the extinction of the human or of a bird species) integrates them as common actors of a game. Simulations can thus be considered as reflexive rituals because they display the uncertainties of the beings they play with and help to mitigate their threats. Framing simulation as an operation unfolding between the spheres of mimetic play and reflexive ritual, and at the same time performing a series of subject-object reversals, I have argued for the need to approach this key apparatus of preparedness through a lens that allows for the mixing of pastoral and cynegetic techniques.",

En s'appuyant sur les distinctions entre la simulation, le ritual et le jeu, il montre que l'engagement des acteurs dans l'imaginaire des simulations, qu'ils d\u00e9crivent sous le terme de \u00ab r\u00e9alisme \u00bb, renverse r\u00e9flexivement les oppositions entre les humains and les non-humains, l'actif et le passif, la fiction et la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qui organisent la vie quotidienne. En empruntant les concepts de l'anthropologie des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de chasseurs, il montre que les simulations de maladies aviaires, lorsqu'elles sont per\u00e7ues comme des signes d'une potentielle extinction d'esp\u00e8ce, recourent\u00e0 des techniques de pouvoir cyn\u00e9g\u00e9tiques, dans lesquelles des humains et des animaux\u00e9changent sym\u00e9triquement leurs perspectives, et pas seulement\u00e0 des techniques pastoralistes, dans lesquelles les humains sont au-dessus de la population qu'ils surveillent et parfois sacrifient.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Keck is a researcher at the Laboratoire d'anthropologie sociale (Coll\u00e8ge de France, EHESS, CNRS, PSL).
