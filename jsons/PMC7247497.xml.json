The latest data show that in China, although the government took effective measures to stop the virus from spreading, GDP in the first quarter of 2020 fell by 6.8% in comparison with an increase of 6.1% in 2019 (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2020). At same time, it is obvious that this worldwide disaster has also brought a huge crisis to firms not only in China but also in most countries, which has attracted attention to research on what firms should do to survive unexpected disasters in the future. This sudden crisis requires firms worldwide and in China to formulate and implement proper strategies for crisis management.",

However, previous studies on crisis management focus more on topics such as organizational capabilities (Andreou et al., 2017, Parker and Ameen, 2018), corporate response (Runyan, 2006; Hale, Dulek, & Hale, 2005), human resource management (Harvey and Haines Iii, 2005, Lee and Warner, 2005, Sanchez et al., 1995), and corporate social responsibility (Bundy & Pfarrer, 2015). These research findings are undoubtedly significant for firms\u2019 crisis management, but marketing innovation, as a significant form of innovation, has received less scrutiny in research on crisis management, with the exception of Naidoo (2010). Further analysis of Naidoo (2010) finds that it focuses on empirically revealing the link among marketing orientation, marketing innovation capabilities, competitive advantages, and firm survival in the context of general economic crisis, and defines marketing innovation capabilities as incremental improvement in terms of marketing tactics (i.e. marketing mix) rather than in perspective of marketing strategy. It fails to identify the typology of marketing innovation strategies in crisis. In addition, it also fails to investigate how a firm should design, choose, and implement proper marketing innovation strategies as a response to the crisis of Covid-19 in particular, which is quite different from the general economic crisis in the history.",

For example, people must isolate themselves at home and decline physical contact to prevent infection; thus, firms must pay more attention to developing and strengthening their online business by rapidly marketing innovations. Furthermore, among all affected countries, China was the first country to be hit heavily by COVID-19 crisis, and the first to manage to recover as well. Thus practices of firms in China provide sufficient evidence of marketing innovation strategies that are significant contributing factors for firms\u2019 survival during the COVID-19 crisis. Besides, study of firms in China could provide firms in other countries lots of experience in dealing with the crisis and recovering in its aftermath. Hence, to address the above research gap, this study is intended to focus specifically on firms in China, and explores what kind of marketing innovation strategies firms should adopt and how firms should choose and implement specific marketing innovation strategies more effectively to respond to the rapidly changing consumption patterns of customers to survive and recover from the sudden COVID-19 crisis.",

This study develops a typology of the marketing innovation strategies of firms under crisis management in two dimensions: motivation for innovations and the level of collaborative innovations. In this typology, four marketing innovation strategies are identified as proactive responses to the COVID-19 crisis based on the successful experiences of firms in China. Furthermore, this research explores how firms should properly choose and implement specific marketing innovation strategies based on an in-depth analysis of firms\u2019 external factors, internal advantages (i.e., dynamic capabilities and resource dependence), and their own characteristics, which enriches the literature related to crisis management and provides new scenarios for research on marketing innovations.",

In the three months since the end of Jan. 2020, China\u2019s economy has been heavily influenced by the COVID-19 crisis. People are showing great concern about health and safety, which has resulted in fundamental changes in their preferences and purchasing patterns. Firms in China have been highly affected and are seeking new market opportunities during the ongoing crisis. A survey of 995 firms from China shows that approximately 85.01% of them face the risk of bankruptcy because of the significant drop in operating income and the lack of cash flow if the crisis cannot be addressed successfully within three months (Zhu, Liu, & Wei, 2020). Another survey on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on business management shows that firms generally face a sharp reduction of orders, cost pressures such as rent, wages and taxes, a general increase in the prices of raw materials, insufficient demand, and difficulty in finding alternative suppliers (Wen, Wei, & Wang, 2020). Furthermore, due to home quarantine, consumers\u2019 purchasing activities have largely decreased. According to Kantar's market research, consumers' consumption attitudes have tended to be more conservative after the outbreak of COVID-19 and they prefer to reduce unnecessary expenses (Kantar, , 2020a), which resulted in a sharp decline in firms\u2019 revenue in the first quarter of 2020.",

Overcoming difficulties during the crisis and transforming the crisis into an opportunity are common choices of all firms in China. Among the surviving firms in China, a majority perform fairly well in marketing innovations to adapt quickly to turbulent, uncertain, and ambiguous environments. For example, weak consumer demand is one of the greatest challenges in the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, based on deep insight into the changes in consumers' psychology and behaviors during home isolation, many retailers and even some leading manufacturers choose to use e-commerce livestreaming as a new channel that can be adapted to the policy of home quarantine and makes it more convenient for consumers to obtain access to the products or services they need.",

Especially in times of environmental turmoil such as natural crises, firms need to realize the need for innovations to resist destruction (Danneels, 2002, Schumpeter, 1950). In the context of sudden disasters such as the COVID-19 crisis, technological innovations always require a long research and development cycle (Bushee, 1998), while marketing innovations (compared to technological innovations) can be implemented relatively quickly to adapt to the new and changing demand of customers. Therefore, marketing innovation is an effective strategy for firms\u2019 survival during the COVID-19 crisis (Naidoo, 2010). Thus, the rest of this study will identify and discuss the feasible marketing innovation strategies chosen by firms in China to provide access to consumers more effectively and stimulate more consumption and will provide valuable insights for firms to survive and recover from the COVID-19 crisis.",

            "text": "The first dimension describes the motivation for innovations. This dimension highlights the degree of impact a firm is suffering during the crisis. Prior research suggests that risk-taking activities are responses to firms\u2019 performance feedback (Chen and Miller, 2007, Chrisman and Patel, 2012, Joseph et al., 2016). According to the behavioral theory of the firm (Cyert & March, 1963), if a firm\u2019s performance is lower than its expected level, the firm has a strong incentive to initiate problemistic search. That is, the firm looks for solutions to its key problems (March, 1988), thereby increase R&D investment, conduct M&A, or engaging in other risk-taking behaviors (Xu, Zhou, & Du, 2019).When a firm\u2019s performance is higher than the expected level, the firm will have sufficient resources and abilities to start a slack search. That is, the firm may take advantage of its slack resources and turn them into long-term competitive advantages (O'Brien & David, 2014). Therefore, during the COVID-19 crisis, according to the various degrees of impact, firms usually have different motivations for innovation. In other words, firms in China may have problemistic searches or slack searches for their own choices in the COVID-19 crisis. To survive the crisis, highly affected firms tend to choose problemistic searches and manage to innovate their marketing strategies to keep their existing business and retain their current user groups. In comparison, other firms that have not suffered sharp shocks tend to prefer slack searches and make full use of any possible new opportunities in the COVID-19 crisis to devote themselves to marketing innovations to expand their business or gaining more consumers.",

This depends on whether a firm has enough resources and capabilities to innovate independently. For any firm, innovations are critical but challenging tasks, and they usually involve seeking new ideas, new tools, or new opportunities to upgrade existing businesses or to create new business (Subramaniam & Yountt, 2005). If a firm\u2019s own business can be upgraded or it can develop a new business with its own resources and capabilities, it may choose to achieve marketing innovations independently. Otherwise, a firm may tend to choose to co-innovate with other firms by sharing complementary resources and competencies with each other (Rothwell & Dodgson, 1991; Doz, Olk, & Ring, 2000; Grandori & Soda, 1995).",

            "text": "The two dimensions mentioned above represent four prototypical marketing innovation strategies (see Figure 1\n). A firm that is suffering from the COVID-19 crisis can choose and implement a specific marketing innovation strategy that suits it best based on this framework to overcome risks and seize opportunities. As shown in Figure 1, the first upper left quadrant represents a strategy that focuses on problemistic search and independent innovations, which can be called the responsive strategy in the COVID-19 crisis. It occurs when a firm must achieve marketing innovations for its existing business (for example, innovating its market channels) to restore its performance. Firms that have been hit hard by the crisis may prefer this specific responsive strategy because they usually have stronger motivation for a problemistic search to find new solutions to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. When choosing this strategy, firms need to deploy their own resources and perform marketing innovations to adapt to the new demand pattern of their target customers to realize the survivability of their existing businesses. Since consumers do not have the opportunity to consume offline due to home quarantine during the COVID-19 crisis, firms whose orders of products or services were acquired only by interaction with consumers offline are significantly influenced. In response, they may manage to establish a new e-channel of marketing to survive. One example of this responsive strategy is that firms take advantage of rapidly emerging Internet platforms where transactions can be made without traditional interpersonal contact and transfer all (or at least part of) traditional business to online channels (e.g., Chen and Zhao, 2020, ChinaSSPP.com., 2020a, Lu, 2020). As a result, e-commerce livestreaming is becoming increasingly popular during the COVID-19 crisis for online retailing, which has emerged in the last several years. At the beginning, online celebrities shared their experiences of product consumption, which gradually evolved into product recommendations in collaboration with firms (Cunningham, Craig, & Lv, 2019). During the COVID-19 crisis, Peacebird, a clothing brand, has rapidly adopted this specific strategy, inviting superstars, online celebrities, and even corporate CEOs to sell goods in live broadcasts and develop a new virtual connection with their existing customers (Zhou, 2020). Relevant evidence shows that with this marketing innovation strategy, the average daily retail sales of Peacebird exceeded 8 million during the COVID-19 crisis (ChinaSSPP.com, 2020a).",

In this specific strategy, the firms have also been hit hard by the crisis, but they have insufficient resources and capabilities to rapidly upgrade their business independently, such as channel transfer, due to their business restrictions. Thus, based on the motivation of problemistic search, firms that use this strategy tend to adopt collaborative innovations and share complementary resources and competencies with other firms. This strategy can not only earn profits from new business by leveraging existing resources but also contributes to revitalizing existing business for the firm. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, residents seldom drive their cars, so there is almost no business for gas stations (Finance.sina, 2020a). The product characteristic of gasoline makes it almost impossible to be sold and fueled online. This situation forced Sinopec to analyze its business strategy very carefully, and it discovered that it was becoming more difficult for residents to buy food outside as they did before the crisis (Finance.sina, 2020b). Thus, Sinopec cooperated with local food suppliers and launched a new contactless service based on its widespread gas station outlets in communities that makes it very convenient for people to buy fresh food regardless of whether they need to fuel their cars (Cuba, 2020). This cross-border collaborative innovation provides Sinopec with new opportunities to develop diverse businesses and overcome the bottleneck faced by the original refueling business during the crisis (Ocn.com, 2020).",

The key for firms that adopt this specific strategy is to develop new businesses by combining their internal advantages of digital resources with the external complementary resources of their partners. In this way, they can develop new markets and acquire new customer groups. Taking the Tik Tok short video platform as an example, its users previously shared their lives on the platform in the form of short videos. During the crisis, this type of social media platform gained great market growth (199IT, , 2020). At the same time, firms such as museums and movie theaters were unable to generate revenue because of home quarantine. It is extraordinarily hard for these types of offline firms to build a new online business. Therefore, Tik Tok seized upon the needs of potential users and launched new services such as online exhibitions, online movie playback, and online education in the livestreaming sector (199IT, , 2020).",

This transfer provides the opportunity to maintain the normal operation of their existing business while responding successfully to the rapidly changing purchasing patterns of customers during the COVID-19 crisis. Taking the clothing brand Peacebird as an example, its core business is offline retailing in large shopping malls (ChinaSSPP.com, 2020b). During the crisis, some of this firm's offline stores were forced to suspend business due to the sharp reduction of offline consumer demand (Zhou, 2020). Relying on sensitive insights into marketing demand, the firm quickly reorganized and configured the inventory of closed stores, transferred offline store employees to online marketing teams, and provided employees with targeted online marketing knowledge training (ChinaSSPP.com, 2020a). Finally, with the help of livestreaming and social media platforms to reach consumers, Peacebird completed a successful channel transformation and survived the crisis (Zhou, 2020). Similarly, the China Construction Bank launched an online \u201ccloud studio\u201d to provide financial services to customers through WeChat applets (Lu, 2020) , and China Evergrande Group, a real estate company, implemented projects to obtain signatures on smart phones and conduct housing transactions online across the country (Chen & Zhao, 2020).",

Because of the constraints of these firms\u2019 own resources and capacities, they must develop their new businesses through collaboration with external firms to create collective value as a system (Lusch et al., 2010, Gandia and Gardet, 2019).

To solve this problem, Sinopec seized its customers\u2019 new demand opportunity, i.e., the demand for fresh food with no physical interpersonal contact; it quickly cooperated with the fresh food retailer Freshippo of the Alibaba Group and launched grocery shopping with contactless distribution at its widespread gas station outlets (Cuba, 2020).

On the basis of its gas station outlets, Sinopec makes full use of the resources and logistics of Freshippo of the Alibaba Group in the fresh food supply chain to achieve business innovations. Furthermore, this new business drives the demand of the existing consumer base for refueling business to some degree, enabling the original refueling business to be revitalized (Ocn.com, 2020).",

The concentration of resources by the Chinese government made it possible to strictly control the spread of the epidemic. Effective governance provided an external environmental guarantee for the potential effectiveness of the proper marketing innovation strategies of firms. Furthermore, Chinese culture is collectivistic (Hofstede, 1980, Triandis, 2018). In controlling the COVID-19 crisis, everyone in a firm, from the top to the bottom, gathers together to seek ways to overcome difficulties and survive the crisis. Taking livestreaming as an example, popular CEOs of many firms go into live broadcast rooms and present good selling points for their offerings, which embodies the collectivistic nature of Chinese culture. Therefore, when firms in other countries attempt to learn from the experience of firms in China and explore effective marketing innovation strategies, they may have to make certain adjustments based on the institutional system of their own country and the cultural characteristics of their employees and customers.",

            "text": "This study has certain limitations that call for future research. First, by exploring and identifying the marketing innovation strategies of firms in China during the COVID-19 crisis, this article combines crisis management with marketing innovation theory to demonstrate that marketing innovations can help firms in the COVID-19 crisis survive and recover based on an in-depth case analysis. However, there is no empirical test of our conclusions. Future empirical studies are needed to test and extend the findings of this research. Second, to obtain a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of crisis management during the COVID-19 crisis, future research should pay more attention to the generalization of the findings of this study by exploring the possible influences of the institutional system and cultural characteristics of the host countries. Finally, this research focuses only on how marketing innovation strategy contributes to the survival and growth of firms in crisis management. Future research should further explore the joint effects of other functional innovation strategies, such as human resource management, financial management, operations management, and information management, with marketing innovations to build a holistic framework to guide firms in surviving any crisis in the future.",
