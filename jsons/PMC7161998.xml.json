Good inhibitors for each enzyme were selected, resynthesized as pure compounds, and reevaluated for determination of IC50 or K\ni values (Table 1, Scheme 2). In the screening for \u03b1\u2010glucosidase (bakers\u2019 yeast) inhibition, about two\u2010thirds of reaction products were found to be more potent than 4 (see Supporting Information for overall library inhibitory activities). Briefly, \u03b1\u2010glucosidase was inhibited to a greater extent when the compound contained a fused\u2010aromatic ring (e.g. 17 and 25) and a heteroaromatic component (e.g. 19\u201321). It is worth noting that the enzyme was more interactive with a bicyclic than a tri\u2010 or mono\u2010cyclic aglycon (e.g. 16 vs. 25 vs. 10). The \u03b1\u2010glucosidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was also investigated with the same library. The results were similar to those with bakers\u2019 yeast. The most potent one against yeast \u03b1\u2010glucosidase was compound 24, with a K\ni value of 53 nm and a 600\u2010fold selectivity for \u03b1\u2010 over \u03b2\u2010glucosidase. Interestingly, the IC50 values of compounds 15\u201317 for \u03b1\u2010glucosidase were about two\u2010to\u2010three orders of magnitude different. These results suggest that, while a lipophilic binding pocket exists that allows a bicyclic ring such as indole or naphthalene to fit, the specific orientation of these bicyclic rings is also very important.",

A dimethylamino group attached to the aromatic ring could enhance the inhibitory activity (e.g. 11 and 29), as documented previously.26 In particular, structures with a trans\u2010cinnamic moiety were shown to significantly inhibit this enzyme, especially those with meta\u2010halogen substituents (e.g. 12, 13, and 26). Because the trans\u2010cinnamic moiety has a board range of biological properties, including hepatoprotective,31 antimalarial,32 and antioxidant,33 our finding suggests a new application of trans\u2010cinnamic acid and its derivatives. The most inhibitory was reaction product 28 (up to 67 % inhibition), with a K\ni value of 1.2 \u03bcm.

However, in anti\u2010JEV infection, compounds 36\u201338 were more potent than NN\u2010DNJ. Compound 37 (Figure 3) appeared to be less cytotoxic and more potent with IC50=4.7 \u03bcm and IC90=9.2 \u03bcm for DEN\u20102 (Table 2). In the present studies, compounds 36\u201338 with chain lengths of nine, ten, and twelve carbons, respectively, were found to be optimal for the antiviral activity. A similar effect was also noticed against varicella zoster virus.39 Longer alkyl chains, such as, the decyl chain in compound 38, provided a modest increase in potency in cell\u2010based assays, but also resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity, presumably due to the disruption of the lipid bilayer.36\n",

            "text": "From a structural perspective, the alkylated iminocyclitol can be viewed as consisting of two distinct molecular elements: 1) an imino sugar head group and 2) an N\u2010alkyl side chain. The head group is recognized by the ER\u2010\u03b1\u2010glucosidase. The role of the tail, as shown for NN\u2010DNJ, is unclear but it might be able to insert into the membrane to increase its local concentration near the membrane\u2010associated ER glucosidase.40 In recent studies, N\u2010nonyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NN\u2010DGJ), a galactose\u2010type iminocyclitol, was found to still have anti\u2010HBV12 and anti\u2010BVDV13 activities, although it lacks the ability to inhibit \u03b1\u2010glucosidase. These observations suggest that NN\u2010DNJ might possess a different antiviral mechanism. Nevertheless, we found that NN\u2010DGJ did not inhibit either JEV or DEN\u20102 in our cell\u2010based assay system.16 The weaker \u03b1\u2010glucosidase inhibitors 39\u201341, derived from core 4 with eight to ten carbons (Scheme 3), were then evaluated, and we found that 39\u201341 at 10 or 50 \u03bcm did not inhibit either JEV or DEN\u20102 infection (data not shown) in the cell\u2010based assay.",

The structure\u2013activity relationship of iminocyclitols revealed that the acetamido group at the C1 position is crucial, and that the active site pocket of \u03b2\u2010hexosaminidase does not tolerate larger substituents. The methyl group at the ring nitrogen enhances the inhibition activity, whereas aromatic ring substituents cause a decrease in inhibition activity. Our alternative approach to increasing potency is to probe a distant aglycon\u2010binding site of \u03b2\u2010hexosaminidase.

These intermediates were either deprotected under acidic conditions or hydrogenolyzed to give primary amines 50\u201356. In our first attempt to generate a library from compound 50 by amide\u2010bond formation as mentioned above, the high\u2010throughput screening showed no compounds with significantly enhanced inhibitory activities (data not shown). Thus, inhibition studies of compounds 51\u201356 against human placenta N\u2010acetyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010hexosaminidase were carried out. 4\u2010Methylumbelliferyl N\u2010acetyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010glucosaminide (4\u2010MU\u2010GNAc) was used as the substrate. The apparent K\nm and V\nmax values for each substrate were calculated from the Lineweaver\u2013Burke double reciprocal plot of [1/v]/[1/S]. The K\ni values were determined from a replot of the K\nm app versus the inhibitor concentration. Compound 54 is the most potent competitive inhibitor with a K\ni value 2.6 nm (Figure 4). Interestingly, in varying the linkage from N\u2010propyl to N\u2010octyl of compounds 50\u201355, we observed a trend in human \u03b2\u2010hexosaminidase inhibition. Compound 54, with a heptamine moiety, was the strongest inhibitor. In an attempt to further optimize the inhibitor, the linker was replaced by an ethylene glycol chain (hydrophilic linker) to give compound 56 (K\ni=60 nm) and by moderate N\u2010alkyl chains to give compounds such as 57, 58, and 59 (K\ni=180, 250, and 160 nm, respectively). However, these modifications had a negative effect; this indicated the important role of the amino group and the lipophilic chain in compound 54. As the crystal structure of human \u03b2\u2010hexosaminidase B is now available,43 its complex with 54 was modeled to reveal a narrow hydrophobic cleft in the active site, which is mainly enclosed by the side\u2010chain groups of residues W424, Y450, A447, and L453 and the backbone of residues K425 and D426 (Figure 5). The amino group at the terminal site is expected to be largely protonated when binding to the enzyme. It presumably forms a salt bridge with the secondary aglycon binding site of the enzyme.44 It appears that the alkyl linkage is long enough to bring the amine end near enough to have hydrogen\u2010bond interactions with the backbone carbonyl of K425 and A447 and a possible ionic interaction with the carboxyl group of D426.",

Autogrid tool in Autodock 3.0.5 was applied to produce energy grids (50\u00d750\u00d750 in xyz directions with 0.375 \u00c5 spacing) of various types of compound atoms. These grip maps were centered at the active site where the \u03b4\u2010lactone bound. During docking experiments, each compound was kept flexible and the protein was kept rigid. Solis & Wets' local search method with LGA was applied to generate available conformations of compound structures within the active site. The conformational search was conducted by utilizing 0.2 \u00c5 quaternion and 2\u00b0 torsion steps. For each compound structure, a maximum of 5\u00d7106 energy units were evaluated, and 50 poses were selected from 2.7\u00d7105 generations per run. Plausible docking modes were selected from the most abundant cluster (RMSD=2.0 \u00c5), which had the strongest affinity energy. Pictures of the final simulated complex were generated in MGLTOOLS.",
