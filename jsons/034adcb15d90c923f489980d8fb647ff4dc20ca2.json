Stability analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable if a certain threshold quantity, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), is less than unity. On the other hand, if R 0 > 1, it is shown that a unique endemic equilibrium appears and a Hopf bifurcation can occur which causes oscillatory phenomena. The model may have up to three positive equilibria. Numerical simulations suggest that when R 0 > 1 and the media impact is stronger enough, the model exhibits multiple positive equilibria which poses challenge to the prediction and control of the outbreaks of infectious diseases.",

Some factors, such as media coverage, density of population and life style, may affect the incidence rate directly or indirectly.",

However, there are several reasons for using non-linear incidence rates such as saturating and nearly bilinear. For instance, Yorke and London [20] showed that the incidence rate \u03b2(1 \u2212 cI )I S with positive C and time dependent \u03b2 is consistent with the results of the simulations for measles outbreaks. In order to avoid the unboundedness of the contact rate, Capasso and Serio [4] used a saturated incidence function of the form \u03b2SI 1+\u03b2\u03b4I , \u03b4 > 0. To incorporate the effect of the behavioral changes of the susceptible individuals, Liu and coworkers [10, 11] used a non-linear incidence rate given by kI l S 1+\u03b1I h with k, l, \u03b1, h > 0. Ruan and Wang, [14] showed that endemic models with such non-linear incidence rates exhibit various bifurcations include Hopf, homoclinic, and even Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. There have been many models using variety of different non-linear incidence functions to study the disease transmission, we refer the reader to Levin et al. [9] for a more detailed summarization.",

SARS [7, 15, 19] as a new emerging infection disease, it was first appeared in Guangdong province, China in November, 2002. Then in the following year the SARS coronavirus spread rapidly throughout Asia and certain other part of the world [16, 18] . For SARS in the cities of Beijing, Hongkong and Toronto, the spreading and outbreaks all experienced a typical process for people to see how the media coverage and the public alerting plays a role in the whole course of the spreading. For the case in Beijing, it was not clear of the existence and type of such disease until April 21, 2003 [16] . During this period, more susceptible individuals might have been exposed to and infected with the disease unconsciously due to the luck of knowledge of the disease. This fact suggests us to consider the following question: How does the media coverage affect the spreading and control of the infectious diseases like SARS?",

In Section 2 we develop a SEI model to incorporate the media impact to the spreading of the infectious diseases such as SARS. We calculate the reproduction number in Section 3 and prove the local and global stability of the disease free equilibrium. The model in general can have up to three positive equilibria, we shall restrict ourselves to the case when the media impact is small enough that there exists at most one endemic equilibrium. In Section 5 we shall study the local and global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number R 0 > 1 and m is small. We also study the Hopf bifurcation of the endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number is larger enough. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the results on the impact of media and related control and prediction issues.",

The other two thicker curves represent the cases when m = 0.000001 and m = 0.000006, respectively. As shown in Table II , if \u03b3 = 0.05, we have R 0 = 1.188 and R H 0 = 5.52. For all the cases, the endemic equilibrium is a spiral sink which is local asymptotically stable. The population in each compartment approaches its equilibrium value. From the simulation results in Fig. 2 , one can see that the effective media coverage (larger values of m) stabilizes the oscillation, and less number of the individuals become infected in the course of transmission.

For further study, it would be ideal to consider more realistic contact transmission rates to reflect the impact of media coverage and alertness.
