Italy is one of the most involved Country and the outbreak changed dramatically medicine leading in a mandatory reorganization of health care facilities Systemic immunosuppression resulting from tumour and anticancer treatments makes oncological patients more vulnerable to infections, therefore, it's imperative to reduce time spent in hospitals and/or in public environment in order to minimize the epidemic impact.",

            "text": "Regarding pancreatic cancer (PC), the ESMO recommendations in the COVID-19 era [1] consider as \"high priority to treat\" newly diagnosed resectable PC and locally advanced PC (LAPC). Since, radiotherapy (RT) is an essential component of oncological curative therapy, in this era a shorter RT should be preferred to conventional schedule and, when possible, surgery delayed [2] . The surgical related length of hospitalisation, the high risk of pulmonary and postoperative morbidity [3] are unfavourable circumstances to be weighted. As response to pandemia, in several hospitals, surgery has been suspended and possibly relocated to surgical COVID free hubs, impacting on maintaining appropriate waiting times. Therefore, for resectable and borderline PC a neoadjuvant short RT course may reduce the hospitalization period [4] . To overcome the intrinsic radioresistence of PCs, it is essential to safely reach the tumour target with high doses by avoiding surrounding high radiosensitive structures. Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), compared to traditional photon-beam RT, has a peculiar physical selectivity in releasing the dose to the tumour with minimal damage in surrounding tissue [5] , decreasing postradiation morbidity. Further CIRT, compared to photons has a higher relative biological effectiveness . and revealed the ability to suppress metastatic cancer cells capability [6] . CIRT is also effective in eliminating retroperitoneal microinvasion, reducing tumour size, perivascular/lymphatic involvement and improving the resectability rate. Japanese [7] and Italian [6] neoadjuvant short course CIRT trials (8 fractions of CIRT and surgery after 4 weeks) showed no detrimental effect in delaying and safely performing surgery.",
