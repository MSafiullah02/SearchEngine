First, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (see (Mizumoto et al., 2020)) is critical to attempts to estimate the likely burden of severe outcomes (including mortality (Fauci et al., 2020)) when the virus spreads through a population. Second, understanding the possible role of transmission by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts (Fraser et al., 2004). Given that 86% of the cases were undocumented (i.e., mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic) in Wuhan prior to travel restrictions and may account for 79% of infection in severe, symptomatic cases (Li et al., 2020), asymptomatic cases are also likely to play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19.",

We divide incidence i into two categories \u2013 i\na and i\ns \u2013 corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they may differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, Ra and Rs, respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015), g\na(\u03c4) and g\ns(\u03c4). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person (Svensson, 2007), shape the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007). The differences in the generation-interval distributions between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases can be caused by the differences in the natural history of infection irrespective of their transmissibility: Individuals with asymptomatic infections may recover faster and have short generation intervals, or have persistent infection and long generation intervals (cf. (Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007)).",

We assume that generation intervals are gamma distributed, and we set the dispersion to be equal to the squared coefficient of variation (the reciprocal of the gamma shape parameter, see Supplementary Materials). We assume that epidemic growth rate r and the generation-interval distribution of symptomatic case are known, using parameter values that are consistent with earlier COVID-19 models (Park et al., 2020): 1/r\n = 7 days, G\u00afs=8 days, and \u03ba\ns\n = 0.5.

When G\u00afa is long compared to G\u00afs, then we are effectively assuming a longer mean for the overall generation interval. This assumption leads to a larger estimate of R0 for a fixed value of r (see (Park et al., 2019)). Conversely, when G\u00afa<G\u00afs, generation intervals are shorter, leading to lower estimates of the epidemic strength R0. Both of these effects are stronger when the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z increases (and disappear as z\n \u2192 0). Therefore, when R0 is estimated without explicitly accounting for asymptomatic spread (white, dashed line in Fig. 1B), it can be over- or under- estimated depending on the relative duration of infection between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The qualitative effects of z and G\u00afa/G\u00afs on q and R0 remain robust when we assume narrower (\u03ba\ns\n = \n\u03ba\na\n = 0.3; Figure S2) or wider (\u03ba\ns\n = \n\u03ba\na\n = 0.8; Figure S3) generation intervals.",

Our reproductive number findings fit into a broader framework linking epidemic speed, strength, and generation intervals \u2013 for a given observed speed increases in the mean generation interval imply larger reproduction number (Wearing et al., 2005, Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007, Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007, Powers et al., 2014, Park et al., 2019).",

However, if asymptomatic cases tend to resolve quickly, then current estimates of R0 may be over-estimates of the underlying strength (Fig. 1B), and asymptomatic cases may be driving a larger fraction of secondary cases than we would expect without accounting for their differences (Fig. 1A). The importance of these effects depends on the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic transmission as well as the proportion of incident cases that are asymptomatic (and therefore the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z). The biases in the estimates of R0 will necessarily bias estimates of the amount of intervention required to control the epidemic. Note that cases do not have to be completely asymptomatic for our qualitative results to apply. People with mild symptoms unlikely to be diagnosed in a particular time and place (sometimes referred to as subclinical cases) are expected to affect transmission patterns in the same way.",
