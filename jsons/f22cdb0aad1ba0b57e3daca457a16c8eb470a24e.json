The overall impact of these illnesses on physical function is less well defined for the geriatric population where commonly used markers of altered functional state, such as school and work absenteeism, are not relevant. Although ARTIs have a significant social and economic impact in the young healthy adult, they are not a major cause of serious morbidity and mortality. However, nursing home studies have shown that certain pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and parainfluenza, can cause serious clinical illnesses, prolonged bed rest, and death.2~~ Although precise data are lacking, it is generally accepted that viral respiratory infection rates decrease with increasing These infection rates are generally derived from relatively healthy, older people living independently in the community and may underestimate the incidence of ARTI in frail elderly individuals who are most likely to develop serious sequelae. The development of senior daycare centers in recent years has provided an attractive alternative to the institutionalization of the very frail elderly. 6 Many of the daycare attendees require help with basic activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and toileting, and thus there is much hands-on contact between staff and participants. Because of some similarities between children's daycare and senior daycare, we postulated that ARTI may be a significant problem for seniors in daycare.

This may have been an important factor in our study because elderly daycare participants were visited by preschool children, a group known to have high rates of respiratory infections. It is also possible that elderly individuals who attend daycare are more debilitated and thus more susceptible to infection. The rate of infection found in our study may also be caused, in part, by the intensity of our direct surveillance and the fact that winter months accounted for 9 of 15 months of study.
