            "text": "The early detection of foodborne microbial agents is a critical concern in many interdisciplinary research fields. Among diverse pathogenic microorganisms, foodborne pathogens have accounted for the largest number of domestic and global outbreaks and are responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Foudeh, Fatanat Didar, Veres, & Tabrizian, 2012; Turner et al., 2016). Foodborne pathogens can also originate from the marine environment and include toxic algae, as well as harmful bacteria that could become a huge threat to human health (Visciano et al., 2016). The biotoxins that accumulate in contaminated seafood and the co\u2010occurring pathogens that proliferate during harmful algal blooms may be passed on to higher trophic levels in the marine food network and eventually to humans (Oh et al., 2016). Such pressures on human healthcare have stimulated the development of several diagnostic methods for the identification of microbial pathogens with high precision, short turnover time, and ease of operation (Foudeh et al., 2012; Law, Mutalib, Chan, & Lee, 2014).",

Attributed to the ability to quickly make several copies of genetic materials, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used as a molecular diagnostic method in biomedical and biochemical research (Clerc and Greub, 2010; Craw and Balachandran, 2012; Law et al., 2014; Niemz et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Visciano et al., 2016; Zhang & Ozdemir, 2009). Despite providing high sensitivity and selectivity of DNA amplification, the conventional PCR technique has limitations in realizing downstream detection or separation processes directly after PCR (Adessi et al., 2000; Lazcka, Campo, & Mu\u00f1oz, 2007). Advances in lab\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip (LOC) techniques have enabled the miniaturization and integration of several functional components of PCR, allowing timely detection of biomolecular targets with a better analytical performance. Among several variations of PCR, solid\u2010phase PCR (SP\u2010PCR) is a promising method for developing integrated LOC platforms because it enables amplification followed by immediate detection of DNA. This advantage allows the rapid on\u2010site detection of amplicons in a time\u2010saving manner by overcoming multiple manipulations required for post\u2010analyses of PCR products (Khodakov & Ellis, 2014; Mercier, Slater, & Mayer, 2003; Shin, Perera, Kim, & Park, 2013).",

Hoffmann, M. Trotter, Stetten, Zengerle, & Roth, 2012; J. Hoffmann, S. Hin, Stetten, Zengerle, & Roth, 2012; Kersting, Rausch, Bier, & von Nickisch\u2010Rosenegk, 2014). Most of the reported SP\u2010PCR LOC platforms have focused on the surface modification of solid substrates for the immobilization of solid\u2010support primers. Despite the noticeable improvements highlighted in these systems, disadvantages remain, which need to be overcome. Specifically, a microarray platform for the genotyping of human mutation genes was developed (Damin, Galbiati, Ferrari, & Chiari, 2016). However, that platform requires the synthesis of a copolymer coated onto the substrate surface for the immobilization of primers, which demands extensive and time\u2010consuming preparation steps. An organosilanization method was also introduced to immobilize primers (J. Hoffmann, S. Hin et al., 2012). Although this approach is compatible with SP\u2010PCR, the reproducibility of the coating chemistry depends on highly controlled operative conditions. Besides, the use of bulky apparatuses for the plasma activation of the substrate surface before the coating procedures used in both the abovementioned studies may not meet the conditions of resource\u2010poor laboratories. These shortcomings hamper the realization of an SP\u2010PCR microdevice.",

For the fabrication, the polycarbonate (PC) microdevice was hot embossed to contain microchambers. The amine groups of polyethyleneimine (PEI) were first coated onto PC via aminolysis to form the urethane linkages without requiring prior surface oxidation of PC. The PEI\u2010coated PC was then activated with glutaraldehyde (GA) to produce a reactive surface for the covalent tethering of amine\u2010modified primers. The microdevice was used for the simultaneous amplification and detection of two major foodborne pathogens, namely Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Furthermore, to examine the universal applicability of the microdevice, we applied the platform for the detection of a representative harmful marine microalga, Cochlodinium polykrikoides (C. polykrikoides). After on\u2010chip PCR, the amplicons were directly detected inside the microchambers by fluorescence imaging without having to take out the amplicons. The surface modifications of the PC substrates were characterized by water contact angle measurements, and the density of the coated amine functional groups was also assessed by fluorescence measurements. The feasibility of the SP\u2010PCR microdevice as a portable platform for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes was evaluated via fluorescence measurements directly inside the microchambers immediately after PCR in a consecutive manner.",

The water contact angle of the pristine PC was approximately 80.1\u00b0 \u00b1 0.96\u00b0, which decreased significantly to 32.8\u00b0 \u00b1 4.55\u00b0 after PEI treatment and then increased slightly to 53.5\u00b0 \u00b1 5.41\u00b0 after GA activation. These results were in accordance with those reported in other studies (Gunda, Singh, Norman, Kaur, & Mitra, 2014; Jankowski, Ogo\u0144czyk, Lisowski, & Garstecki, 2012; M. Jang, C. K. Park, & Lee, 2014; M. Jang, S. Park, & Lee, 2014). As shown in Figure 2, changes in the wettability of the substrate surface after each coating step confirmed the successful modification of PC with PEI and subsequently with GA. The PC surface was rendered hydrophilic after the PEI treatment due to the presence of positive charges of dense amine groups decorated on the surface of PC. Amine functional groups were previously reported to directly react with the carbonate backbones of PC chains to form stable urethane linkages (M. Jang, S. Park et al., 2014). This advantage simplifies the modification procedure by getting rid of prior surface oxidation by plasma, allowing the microchambers to be chemically modified even after sealing the microdevice. The next step of activating PEI\u2010coated PC with GA made the surface relatively hydrophobic compared with the earlier PEI treatment alone, probably due to the existence of hydrocarbon chains of GA. Sodium cyanoborohydride was used to reduce the Schiff base bonds formed between aldehyde and amine groups to stable and irreversible secondary amine bonds. The reducing agent targets Schiff bases while sparing free aldehyde groups for the conjugation of amine\u2010modified oligonucleotides (Migneault, Dartiguenave, Bertrand, & Waldron, 2004).",

As shown in Supporting Information Figure S1, the surface amine density increased with the increase in the PEI concentration and the modification time but decreased after 45 and 60 min of coating with 10% PEI. This reduction probably occurred because a higher PEI concentration and longer modification time might have resulted in the stronger polymer entanglement of PEI chains, reducing the interactions between the amine groups of coated PEI and FITC, as well as the final amine density of PEI coated on the PC surface (Pan et al., 2014). The amine density reached 37.13 \u00b1 0.91 nmol cm\u20132 after 60 min of modification with 5% PEI, which was the highest measured density and was significantly different from the other treatments (P < 0.05).

As shown in Figure 3c, the strong green fluorescence of the immobilized amplicons with a low signal background after washing indicated that the PC surface modified with PEI and GA could capture amine\u2010modified PCR amplicons. Control experiments were also performed to evaluate the inherent autofluorescence property of PC (Piruska et al., 2005). The pristine microchamber did not display noticeable fluorescence signals (Figure 3d) even after coating (Figure 3e). From those results, we could conclude that the amine\u2010modified PCR amplicons were successfully captured on the PEI\u2010GA\u2010coated microchambers, as demonstrated by the green fluorescence signal. The surface of PC was successfully modified with PEI and GA within approximately 3 hr without preactivation with plasma, which was not time\u2010consuming as well as did not require extensive coating steps or long\u2010time synthesis of chemicals used for the modification process.",

Also, PEI was more effective than 3\u2010aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in functionalizing the PC surface with amine groups and forming more stable bonds against hydrolytic cleavage (Supporting Information Figure S2c). This was probably because PEI has much higher amine content with the ratio of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines being 1:2:1, as compared with primary amine\u2010bearing APTES.

Primary amines functionalized on PC were reported to suffer from hydrolytic cleavage during the amplification reaction (M. Jang, C. K. Park et al., 2014), which could return PC to its innate hydrophobic characteristic. However, this tendency was mediated in case of PEI, as demonstrated through the ignorable hydrophobic recovery of PEI\u2010coated PC after 30 PCR cycles (Supporting Information Figure S3). This was probably because interactions between PEI and PC take place at both primary and secondary amines (Lee & Ram, 2009), resulting in more stable urethane linkages between PEI and PC.",

Figure 4a,b displays the schematic of the thermal stability test of the surface coating and the immobilized amplicons, which was amplified off\u2010chip from 10 ng (3.25 \u00d7 106 copies) DNA template. As shown in the fluorescence images in Figure 4c,d, the fluorescence intensities were relatively identical before and after thermal treatment. On the basis of the statistical analyses (Supporting Information Figures S2\u2013S4), the continuous changes in temperature during the thermal cycling program resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in the fluorescence intensity after thermal treatment (P > 0.05). Since 85.3% of the fluorescence signal remained after 45 thermal cycles, the linkages between the surface coatings and the immobilized amplicons were highly stable under the thermal cycling conditions. The thermal\u2010induced fluorescence decrease in this study was comparable or even lower to that reported from a study using a copolymer coated on silicon substrates (Damin et al., 2016). A greater loss of fluorescence (31.1%\u201355.6%) under thermal cycling conditions was also reported for the immobilization of DNA on cyclic olefin copolymer or polymer, polypropylene, polydimethylsiloxane, and glass using 1,4\u2010diphenylene diisothiocyanate, a homobifunctional cross\u2010linker (J.

As shown in Figure 5b, the existence of immobilized amplicons was confirmed through the distinct fluorescence signals of Alexa 647 designed for Salmonella spp. and Alexa 488 designed for both S. aureus and C. polykrikoides. The signals indicated that all three targets were successfully amplified and remained covalently attached to the microchambers after the withdrawal of the solution and the subsequent washing steps. The negative controls of each target displayed no fluorescence signal, confirming the absence of nonspecific adsorption of fluorescence\u2010labeled reverse primers. The result also indicated the multiplexing ability of the microdevice, which was comparable to other multiplexing schemes, as presented in Table 1. In addition, the number of desired targets can be increased by fabricating more reaction chambers on the same substrate. As mentioned above, two typical reactions that take place during SP\u2010PCR are liquid\u2010phase and solid\u2010phase amplifications. Liquid\u2010phase amplification usually proceeds efficiently because of the free diffusion of the aqueous primers and outcompetes the solid priming reactions hampered by the steric hindrance of dense solid\u2010support primers (Adessi et al., 2000). To achieve a high efficiency of solid\u2010phase amplification performance, an asymmetric balance of the aqueous forward and fluorescence\u2010labeled reverse primers was adopted. The addition of floating forward primers at a low concentration is advantageous in reducing the steric constraint commonly associated with SP\u2010PCR (Adessi et al., 2000; Khan, Poetter, & Park, 2008) as well as minimizing the competition between the aqueous and surface\u2010grafted primers. In this study, different ratios of aqueous forward and fluorescence\u2010labeled reverse primers were examined, and the ratio of 1:4 was found to suit our experimental setup (Supporting Information Figure S5). Since fluorescence signals independently originate from the fluorescence dyes labeled on the reverse primers regardless of successful amplification of DNA, additional controls were performed to exclude the possibility of nonspecific physical adhesion of the fluorescence\u2010modified reverse primers to the engraved surface of the microchambers. The obtained results demonstrated that nonspecific adhesion of fluorescence\u2010modified primers did not occur either for the pristine and modified microchambers (Supporting Information Figure S6). Also, a procedure of step\u2010by\u2010step surface coating followed by the immobilization of amine\u2010modified primers is crucial for realizing on\u2010chip SP\u2010PCR (Supporting Information Figure S7).",

For comparison, homogeneous PCR, which was normal on\u2010chip PCR, was also performed similarly to evaluate the efficiency of SP\u2010PCR. The collected on\u2010chip PCR products were captured by the PEI\u2010GA\u2010coated microchambers, which were then washed to measure the fluorescence signals of the immobilized amplicons. To confirm the accuracy of dilutions, off\u2010chip PCR reactions were first carried out using a commercial thermal cycler, and the amplicons were analyzed using gel electrophoresis. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S8, the intensities of target bands decreased with decreasing concentration of DNA template, confirming the precision of the dilution series. Figure 6 shows the sensitivity comparison between SP\u2010PCR and homogeneous PCR and their corresponding fluorescence images. As shown in Figure 6a, the efficiency of SP\u2010PCR was generally lower than that of the homogeneous PCR probably due to the steric interactions between the freely diffusing primers and solid\u2010support primers in SP\u2010PCR, as mentioned above. Despite this lower efficiency, the fluorescence signals of the immobilized amplicons in SP\u2010PCR were clearly observed compared with homogeneous PCR. The lowest amount of DNA template at which fluorescence signal can still be observed was 32.5 copies of gDNA. The signals increased with increasing amount of DNA template and almost remained stable when the amount of DNA template was 3.25 \u00d7 105 copies, indicating the saturation of the surface coating with the amplicons.",
