However, to understand the functions of these genes, attention has now turned to the proteins they encode -the \"proteome\". Proteins are responsible for the functional diversity of cells, they perform most biological functions, and it is at their level that many regulatory processes take place, many disease processes occur, and most drug targets are found.",

This is the largescale study of protein expression, structure and function. It aims to correlate the structural and functional diversity of proteins with underlying biological processes, including disease processes. Proteomics has created opportunities to identify, investigate and target proteins that are differentially expressed in health and disease. Clinical research is poised to benefit enormously from these studies, with the potential to develop better diagnostic and prognostic tests, to identify new therapeutic targets and ultimately to allow patient-individualised therapy. 1, 2 Here we describe proteomics technology, how it is being used to study disease, and its potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of a range of conditions.",

Some of these proteins have not previously been associated with drug resistance, and further studies are under way to determine their potential as novel drug targets for treating resistant disease.",

Chloroquine has been one of the most successful drugs to treat malaria but has been rendered virtually ineffective in many parts of the world by the widespread emergence of chloroquine resistance. Proteomics technologies are playing a major role in identifying potential therapeutic targets in Plasmodium species, as well as hostpathogen interactions and protein-drug interactions. 18 Advances to date include the identification of differences between Plasmodium species, identification of immune targets for vaccination and immune protection, and better understanding of the cellular target(s) of chloroquine and mechanisms of chloroquine resistance.",
