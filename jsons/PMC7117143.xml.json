            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) belongs to the genus lentivirus of the family retroviridae. FIV was first isolated in 1987 in the United States and has been reported to induce crucial immunodeficiency in infected cats, which is similar to that in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people (Pedersen et al., 1987). FIV is now widely spread among domestic cats throughout the world including Europe, the United States, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan (Ishida et al., 1989, Lin et al., 1995, Malik et al., 1997, Nakamura et al., 2000, Steinrigl and Klein, 2003, Yamamoto et al., 1989). FIV-infected cats show various degree of immunological impairment resulting in the clinical symptoms including gingivitis, stomatitis, upper respiratory tract infections, myelosuppression and opportunistic infections (Bendinelli et al., 1995, Pedersen and Barlough, 1991, Shelton et al., 1990). Because of the prevalence and various clinical outcomes, FIV infection has been considered as one of the most problematic diseases in small animal practice. A number of antiviral drugs such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, have been shown to inhibit FIV replication in experimentally and naturally FIV-infected cats (Arai et al., 2002, Egberink et al., 1990, Hartmann et al., 1992). However, severe hematological side effects of their antiviral drugs and insufficient clinical improvements in FIV-infected cats were also reported (Arai et al., 2002, Hartmann et al., 1992). Therefore, no effective antiviral therapy for FIV-infected cats has been established.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) homologous to the target transcripts (Fire et al., 1998). The dsRNAs are processed by RNase III-like enzyme Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21\u201323 nucleotides (Bernstein et al., 2001). These siRNAs form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which leads to the degradation of homologous target RNA (Zamore et al., 2000). Introduction of siRNAs can induce the sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian cells (Elbashir et al., 2001). Recent studies have demonstrated that RNAi can be exploited to target a variety of human viruses including HIV-1, poliovirus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (Ge et al., 2003, Gitlin et al., 2002, Jacque et al., 2002, Jiang and Milner, 2002, Randall et al., 2003, Shlomai and Shaul, 2003, Wang et al., 2004). These findings indicate that RNAi represents a promising gene therapeutic approach to control viral infection.",

In contrast, endogenous expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated by viral vectors has been shown to induce persistently the sequence-specific gene silence in a variety of primary cells as well as in experimental animals (Rubinson et al., 2003, Xia et al., 2002). To use the RNAi technology as a strategy of gene therapy for the control of FIV infection, both development of effective delivery method of siRNAs into feline lymphoid cells and achievement of sustained inhibitory effect are required. Lentivirus vector is now recognized to be the most efficient delivery method into non-dividing primary cells. However, it has not been used for clinical practices because the safety of lentivirus vector-mediated gene transfer has not been fully established. On the other hand, retrovirus vector has been applied for several human gene therapy clinical trials (Edelstein et al., 2004). There have been a number of reports indicating the therapeutic effect of retrovirus vector-mediated transfer of antiviral genes in HIV-infected people (Deeks et al., 2002, Wong-Staal et al., 1998).",

Total RNA from each sample was subjected to reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with a TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, a master mixture containing all reagents required for RT-PCR was prepared: 1\u00d7 TaqMan buffer A, 0.2 \u03bcM dNTPs, 5 \u03bcM magnesium chloride, 0.25 U of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase per \u03bcl, 0.4 U of RNase inhibitor per \u03bcl, and 0.05 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase per \u03bcl. Total RNA extract (200 ng of total RNA per tube) was added to the master mixture. This mixture was used for assays of FIV RNA and \u03b2-actin mRNA used as an internal control to give a final probe concentration of 200 nM and a final concentration of each primer of 900 nM, and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 50 \u03bcl.

For application of RNAi technology to therapeutic purposes of naturally FIV-infected cats, sequence diversity of FIV genome should be considered. The sequence used for preparation of G4-siRNA, which efficiently inhibited the replication of FIV in this study, is highly conserved among various strains of FIV (Kakinuma et al., 1995). Therefore, it is highly plausible that the siRNA such as G4 inhibits the replication of various field strains of FIV as well as Petaluma strain.

These results indicated that siRNA homologous to FIV gag gene could specifically inhibit the replication of FIV in chronically FIV-infected cells. Transfection with G4-siRNA at a higher concentration (1 \u03bcM) resulted in inhibition of the replication of FIV by 96%, whereas its inhibition was by 48% at a lower concentration (40 nM). As a large amount of viral transcripts would be generated de novo in CRFK/FIV cells, enough amount of siRNAs might be required to efficiently inhibit the replication of FIV in the cells.",

This result is consistent with previous reports describing that the silencing effect of siRNA rapidly faded away in continuously dividing mammalian cell lines (Elbashir et al., 2001). On the other hand, Song et al. demonstrated that inhibition of the replication of HIV-1 in non-dividing primary monocyte-derived macrophages by transfection with siRNA targeted HIV p24 sustained at least 15 days after transfection (Song et al., 2003). As CRFK/FIV cells were rapidly proliferating, the short-term effect of siRNAs shown in this study might be due to the dilution of siRNAs in the cells.",

Retrovirus vector can infect primary cells and induce the sustained expression of transferred gene. Therefore, we examined the effect of the retrovirus vector-mediated transfer of the shRNA in feline T-cell line. The amount of FIV RNA and RT activity in the culture supernatant of the FL4 cells were markedly decreased even 2 weeks after transduction with a retrovirus vector which express shRNA specific to FIV. This result suggests the therapeutic effect of the retrovirus vector-mediated delivery of FIV-specific shRNA in cells infected with FIV. However, the retrovirus vector-mediated FIV-specific shRNA transfer could not achieve complete inhibition of FIV replication even after the selection by antibiotic. As for the reason, there might exist a small number of cells in which the amount of shRNA was not enough to inhibit FIV replication even in cells after antibiotic selection. As another possibility, FIV clones to escape from the shRNA might exist in FL4 cells because it is not a cloned cell line.",

However, the transduction efficiency of a same retrovirus vector used in this study containing a fluorescence marker gene, ZsGreen, into feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 5\u20136% at MOI 10 whereas more than 90% into FL4 cells (data not shown). Further investigation is necessary to improve the transduction efficiency of the retrovirus vector in primary T cells. Another candidate of target cells for RNAi gene therapy to control FIV infection is hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Development of antiviral gene therapy strategies that target HSC has been proposed as a long-term treatment for AIDS induced by HIV infection. In theory, permanent resistance to HIV infection can be achieved through the introduction of antiviral genes into pluripotent HSC because of their capacity of self-renewal as well as proliferation and differentiation into lymphoid lineage. Recently, HSCs transduced with siRNA construct directed to HIV were shown to allow to mature into T-lymphocytes in vivo in SCID-hu mouse thy/liv grafts and these HSC-derived siRNA-expressing T cells and macrophages showed marked resistance to HIV infection (Banerjea et al., 2003). Although isolation and purification system of feline HSC has not been established, viral vector-mediated transfer of anti-FIV shRNA into HSC will be a useful gene therapy strategy for the control of FIV infection in cats in future.",
