In terms of policy instruments, it refers to \u201cthe deliberate and conscious attempt to define policy goals and to connect them to instruments or tools expected to realize those objections\u201d (Howlett et al. 2015, 292; see also Majone 1975; May 2003; Howlett 2019a). Within policy studies, policy design has been linked to research addressing policy implementation and policy instruments (May 2003), policy ideas and policy formulation (e.g., Linder and Peters 1990a, b; 1991; James and Jorgensen 2009), and governance (Howlett 2009, 2014; Howlett and Rayner 2007). Those who subscribe to the manner of thinking advocated by political science, among them the authors of this article, regard policy design as involving (1) politics; (2) conflicts\u2014concerning the values pursued and the evidence that can be used\u2014which originate from differences among policy paradigms (Hall 1993) and from variances in the social and political construction of both the problem and the target population (Schneider and Sidneu 2009); and (3) the engagement of social actors and citizens (Peters 2018).",

The fact that humans are \u201cdisproportionate information processors\u201d (Jones 2001, p. 23; see also Jones and Baumgartner 2005) can likewise lead to policy over- and under-design. We also make information the primary focus of this article, directing attention to variations among policy designs with regard to their quality of information (Stone 2002, 22).",

This divergence from the standard assumption has gained solid support among scholars (e.g., Simon 1973; de Leon 1999; Hargrove 1975; Rittel and Weber 1973; Walker et al. 2001, 2010; Kwakkel et al. 2010; Howlett 2019a; Mathijssen et al. 2007; Daviter 2019). Studies have also demonstrated that policy actors interpret scientifically validated information according to their belief-system and mental models (e.g., Sarewitz 2004; Weible et al. 2008; Kahan 2016; Heikkila et al. 2020); that there are contextual frictions in the conversion of this information into policy (e.g., Bennett and Howlett 1992; Jasanoff 1987; Radaelli 1995; see also Daviter 2015); and that when science truly leads policy making, nationally established ideas may place policies on trajectories that ignore countervailing new information until the latter becomes overwhelming (Baekkeskov 2016). Note that, some policies emerge from a process that is not designed (Howlett and Mukherjee 2014), and therefore may involve no relevant evidence, and that ideological designs are characterized by the absence of real evidence (Peters 2018, 50).",

We adopt this broad definition because \u201c[policy] problems are in part subjective and in part objective, and any policy solution to a problem will have clear distributional effects\u201d (Baumgartner and Jones 2015, 7). Information quality is defined as information on costs, timescales, benefits and risks that is accurate, timely, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented and accessible to policy designers. It can be measured, for example, by using a questionnaire comprised of 16 dimensions, namely accessibility; the appropriate amount of information; believability; completeness; concise representation; consistent representation; ease of manipulation; freedom from error; interpretability; objectivity; relevancy; reputation; security; timeliness; understandability; and value-added (Strong 2009). Operational definition of these dimensions could be found elsewhere (Wang and Strong 1996; Najjar and Schniederjans 2006). Information quality includes therefore both objective dimensions (e.g., accuracy) as well as subjective dimensions that are defined relative to the context of a policy designer performing a certain task which requires the information (e.g., timeliness) (e.g., Strong 2009; English 2001; Mai 2013; Gustavsson and W\u00e4nstr\u00f6m 2009).",

Misleading statistics may originate, for example, from errors in assumptions. Specifically, over-design may incur additional costs when actual conditions are less severe than assumed conditions, while additional failures may result from under-design when actual conditions are more severe than the assumed design conditions. Another example is a situation involving the mistaken assumption that a certain capacity of a policy-related element will follow the normal distribution in the event of a flood, when, in fact, it follows a gamma distribution, thereby leading to over-design. Alternatively, statistical errors may occur in sampling. The ineffectiveness of a sample affects trend detection: positive and negative autocorrelation lead to overestimation and underestimation, respectively, of a trend. Errors in trend detection can lead to either over-design or under-design, thereby misleading policy designers (Pathak et al. 2017). In addition to errors in assumptions and sampling, data gaps in big data pertaining, for example, to minority groups (Giest and Samuels 2020), can furthermore undermine the quality of information available to policy designers.",

Not surprisingly, information selection lies at the core of decision-making in the policy design process (Simon 1973). A major obstacle in executing this task is information overload (e.g., Edmunds and Morris 2000; Jansen 2008), which may be strategically induced (Persson 2018) by a variety of policy entrepreneurs (e.g., Maor 2017a) and other actors. Studies have also discussed information avoidance (Case et al. 2005) or filtering (Miller 1960) by decision-makers. In political science, Walgrave and Dejaeghere (2017) demonstrated that politicians partially outsource their information selection to procedures and/or staff members, personally apply rigorous rules of thumb concerning what they should attend to and what they should not, and compensate for the pressure and constant risk of error with a large dose of self-confidence. Given the limited capacity of the human brain and the fact that much information is noise (Gigerenzer and Todd 1999), focusing on the variance in the quality of information available to policy designers during a policy design process can give the terms under investigation an analytical value. Attention first turns to the definition of proportionate policy design.",

High-quality information (e.g., scientifically validated information; strong comparators) can be gathered when the policy problem has been effectively articulated and well posed in the first place; when the proposed design is based on an informed theory; and when policy goals are relatively clear. The abundance of information of varying quality requires policy designers to separate the wheat from the chaff, that is, to gather the information necessary to formulate stable policy rules and to allow for some degree of freedom to adjust policy incentives over time in order to increase social welfare. Yet it also requires that policy designers ignore some information, preferably low-quality, unnecessary information. The study of heuristics\u2014efficient cognitive processes that ignore information\u2014indeed shows that less information, computation and time can improve accuracy (Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009).

This process of ascertaining the intensity of the constraints within which the intended policy will be implemented has two facets, which vary along the temporal dimension. In cases of short-term policy goals, the aim of policy designers is to accurately gauge the intensity of current constraints and fully incorporate this information into the design process at the proper time. In cases of long-term policy goals, the aim of policy designers is to ascertain (1) which constraints cannot be modified; (2) which constraints can be ignored; and (3) which can be modified (and how) before implementation begins in order to increase the chances of policy success (e.g., by changing attitudes, ideas and norms). Thereafter, this information should be fully incorporated into the design process at the proper time. The same rationale may be applied to relationships among policy problem elements\u2014the substantive nature of the policy problem (Peters 2005; Peters and Hoornbeek 2017)\u2014if those are viewed as implicit or explicit forms of constraints. Gathering high-quality information regarding external and/or internal constraints is vital if policy designers need to accommodate abstract information or any information which is temporarily indistinguishable from random data (e.g., when the definitions of the policy problem and the viability of policy solutions are not stable across time; Rice and Fineman 2004).",

An example of a proportionate design for a simple problem and a simple solution is automobile speeding regulation (Howlett 2019a, 17). Another example is the design of the national electricity transmission systems in France and the UK in the middle of the twentieth century, which superimposed the national priorities upon the regional and local. This resulted in well-designed and efficient systems, in comparison with many other European countries in which local municipalities were allowed to maintain control, resulting in weak networks (Helm 2014). An additional example in the area of public bureaucracy is the design of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval policy, which at times relies on federal advisory committees. Drugs submitted to the FDA for review between 1989 and 2000 that underwent review by an advisory committee before approval were significantly less likely to encounter safety problems after they were released into the market (e.g., drug warnings and withdrawal from the market) than those which did not receive an advisory committee review, all else being equal (Moffitt 2014).

Policy designers may consequently find themselves relying on statistical models characterized by poor generalization ability. Over-adjustment occurs when an adjustment is undertaken for intermediate variables even though the total causal effect of policy instruments on policy outcome is of interest. Such an adjustment will often bias estimates of the total causal effect toward null (Schisterman et al. 2009).

Unnecessary adjustment during the policy design stage is a phenomenon that occurs when policy designers\u2019 control for a variable does not affect the expectations regarding the estimate of the total causal effect between a policy instrument and a policy outcome (adapted from Schisterman et al. 2009). Unnecessary adjustment in cases of technical problem-solving may occur, among others, in three cases: (1) adjusting for a completely irrelevant variable; (2) adjusting for a variable that causes solely negligible (policy) outcomes; and (3) adjusting for a variable whose only causal association with variables of interest is limited because it is not in the causal pathway identified. The result of adjustment for such variables is that the total causal effect of a policy tool on policy outcome remains unchanged (in expectation). Some unnecessary adjustment of variables could harm designers\u2019 estimates by decreasing the precision of the policy design. This, in turn, entails the risk of undermining policy reliability.

Increased complexity facilitates regulatory capture, for example, as politicians incorporate loopholes so that the policy only simulates effectiveness (as in the case of EU emissions Trading Schemes, see Helm 2010, 195). Second, the intermediate/final policy design becomes less flexible, limiting the possibility of making changes at a later stage of the policy design process, when high-quality information becomes available.

Furthermore, when considering the challenges for water infrastructure planning and design brought about by climate change, under-designed solutions may not only fail frequently, but these failures may be magnified by the uncertainty in the long-term frequency and magnitude of future extreme events (Huia et al. 2018).",

An example is the crime and punishment bubble in the USA in the 2000s (Jones et al. 2014), especially the over-criminalization of drug use and possession, which has been manifested by over 1 million drug possession arrests by police each year (FBI 2017). However, there are conditions under which the implementation of over-designed policies may lead to proportionate policy and, in rare cases, even to policy underreaction (Maor 2014b). This is most likely to occur when the implementation of over-designed policy is (significantly) undermined by the complexity of the design. Regarding policy effectiveness, although over-designed policies are not economical and involve wasted resources, they do not necessarily preclude the achievement of policy goals. Policy over-design that is implemented as planned does not undermine performance since its results may be more robust than proportionately designed policies. However, this policy may also cost more.",

Once this risk materializes, it is likely to generate policy underreaction in the short-term and, if sustained by self-reinforcing processes, negative policy bubbles (Maor 2016) in the long run. Furthermore, if a policy design involving financial assets does not include strict financial regulations (hence, under-designed policy), financial bubbles are highly likely to emerge. An example is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which underestimated the fact that carbon allowances are financial assets, potentially vulnerable to the behavior of traders and investors. This scheme led to episodes of speculation and price bubbles related to energy and environmental policy announcements (Cret\u00ed and Jo\u00ebts 2017). Importantly, as long as the risk of failure does not materialize, under-designed policies may be (wrongly) perceived by the public as proportionate. This is because such policies require substantial policy maintenance costs that may be hidden from public view. Under-designed policies entail also significant policy failure costs and have a short implementation due to the efforts saved. In addition to their poor operational performance, under-designed policies increase the risk of accidents, cause economic losses during negative events, and may incur liability lawsuits and voter dissatisfaction.",

Further, in certain policy areas, the harm of over-design is visible and salient only to concentrated groups (e.g., regulated businesses), whereas under-design has greater resonance with the public at large (e.g., Gilad et al. 2015, 457).

Such policy solutions will be expensive and costly, yet they may be effective in political terms (Bovens and \u2018t Hart 1996). Political executives who wish to underreact, for example, in areas of climate change and equal pay, may opt for policy solutions that are under-designed. They may do so by, for example, rejecting scientific information that counters their existing policy positions (e.g., Heikkila et al. 2020).

Future research should ascertain variance in the role of information quality in policy design at these levels of analysis, and it should also consider which factors and actors at each level can affect these variations, or are affected by them, in ways that increase the probability for over- and under-design. Developing multi-level theorizing and analytical techniques will be an asset for researchers and practitioners. Future research that takes advantage of these emerging approaches can enhance our understanding of how the parameters of information quality contribute to explaining under- and over-design across levels of analysis.",

Temporal variability of information quality can significantly influence the effectiveness and efficiency of information-driven processes involved in policy design. Future theorizing and empirical research must pay greater attention to the role of time in such processes; how and why such processes change and evolve over time; how the changes in the role played by businesses and civil society in such processes affect policy design outcomes; and how different macro-social factors generate such processes. The high level of interest in policy design improvement among practitioners may facilitate their cooperation in advancing the study of information quality in policy design processes.",
