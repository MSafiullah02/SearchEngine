Coyotes are considered seasonally monestrous (Hamlett, 1938, Gier, 1968) and socially monogamous (Andelt, 1985, Bekoff and Wells, 1986, Gese, 2001). While there is some regional variation in the actual breeding season, coyotes generally mate in mid- to late-winter, have a gestation period of 60\u201363 days, and deliver an average litter of three to seven pups in the spring (Hamlett, 1938, Gier, 1968, Knowlton, 1972, Gese et al., 1989). Typically, only the dominant male and female within a coyote social group produce a litter (Gese et al., 1989, Gese et al., 1996), although subordinate associates will help defend the pups and territory (Andelt, 1985, Bekoff and Wells, 1986, Gese, 2001).",

Like the wolf and dog, differentiating a pregnant coyote from a non-pregnant female can be difficult if based on serological assessment alone. Pregnant and pseudopregnant coyotes have similar patterns of serum progesterone secretion, and the absolute concentration levels vary widely among individuals (Carlson, 2006). Also, while mid-gestation prolactin levels in coyotes rise significantly above those observed in non-gravid diestrous females, the absolute values still overlap (Carlson, 2006). Thus, single blood sampling for progesterone or prolactin seems unreliable as a method of determining reproductive status in coyotes. The hormone relaxin, however, has not yet been explored in this species.",

            "text": "Relaxin is a polypeptide shown to affect the reproductive tissues of mammals, most commonly \u201ccervical extensibility and uterine contractibility\u201d (Sherwood, 1994). The source of relaxin synthesis varies among species, but the predominant sites are the corpus luteum, placenta, and uterus (Sherwood, 1994). Depending on the species, detection of relaxin in peripheral blood is not always restricted to pregnant females; however in the domestic dog it has been established as a pregnancy-specific hormone (Steinetz et al., 1987, Steinetz et al., 1989). The site of synthesis in the bitch has been elucidated (Tsutsui and Stewart, 1991, Klonisch et al., 1999) and primarily ascribed to the placenta, although the hormone can also be traced in the ovary and uterus. These latter tissues may be areas influenced by the paracrine deposition of relaxin. A clinical study of domestic dogs using the commercially available canine relaxin enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) ReproCHEK\u2122 (Synbiotics Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) reported detection of the hormone in maternal peripheral blood as early as 25 days after ovulation (Buff et al., 2001).",

Pre-partum plasma samples (n = 214) were collected from 82 females between day 10 of gestation and parturition. Post-partum sampling continued after the 2000\u20132002 breeding seasons with 44 females (n = 114) spanning 140 days, although sampling was suspended between days 28 and 60. Data were aligned by day of parturition (indicated by the vertical dashed line) and assumed a full term gestation of 62 days. During this study, the optical density measurements for non-pregnant females consistently remained below the 0.100 OD threshold as indicated by the horizontal dashed line. Solid line represents the median observed OD measurement.",
