            "text": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a notorious Gram-negative bacterium assigned as one of the most dangerous nosocomial pathogens (Huang et al. 2016). This serious health threat could cause multiple infection types of meninges, soft tissues, pulmonary, urinary and systemic tissues (McConnell et al. 2013) among which pneumonia is the main one (Fajardo Bonin et al. 2014). The mortality rate of A. baumannii-associated infections is as high as 70% and 60% for pneumonia and bacteremia, respectively (Fajardo Bonin et al. 2014). Recent reports on the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains could be considered as concerning alarm for the bacterium treatment (Pach\u00f3n and McConnell 2014). Since there is no commercially effective antibiotic against its rapid emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pan-drug resistant (PDR) strains of the pathogen, clinical management of these successful pathogens is difficult (Pach\u00f3n and McConnell 2014). Hence, researchers are motivated to benefit from alternative approaches such as active or passive immunization to combat with A. baumannii. For as much as this superbug is an opportunistic pathogen, it is known as a troublesome bacterium in immunocompromised patients (Ahmad et al. 2016). In the aforementioned case, the failure of active immunization is probable (Pach\u00f3n and McConnell 2014; Perez and Bonomo 2014; Ahmad et al. 2016) highlighting passive immunization via antibodies elicited against engaged antigens. In this respect, the antigens producing protective active and passive immunization could be assumed as appropriate. To date, a number of in silico, in vitro and in vivo investigations have been conducted to nominate or design protein antigens (Fattahian et al. 2011; Bentancor et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2012; Rahbar et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2013; Moriel et al. 2013; Fajardo Bonin et al. 2014; Hosseingholi et al. 2014; Badmasti et al. 2015; Chiang et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2015, 2016 Sefid et al. 2015; Garg et al. 2016; Singh et al. 2016; Jahangiri et al. 2017, 2018a, b Ni et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2018; Song et al. 2018; Bazmara et al. 2017), OmpA (Luo et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2013), OmpW (Huang et al. 2015), Bap (Fattahian et al. 2011), Omp22 (Huang et al. 2016) and FilF (Singh et al. 2016) are among protective antigens against this nosocomial pathogen. Amongst the antigens, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are considerable owing to their roles in antibiotic resistance, adhesion to host cells and pathogenicity of the bacterium in addition to their high immunogenicity (McConnell et al. 2013; Fajardo Bonin et al. 2014). OMPs are abundant on bacterial cell surface making them suitable target to be engaged as vaccine candidates (Fajardo Bonin et al. 2014). Although some promising immunogens such as OmpA have been remarked (Chen 2015), attempts toward unveiling new targets are in progress. Reverse vaccinology is known as a robust approach to introduce novel targets as appropriate vaccine candidates (Moriel et al. 2013; Chiang et al. 2015; Ni et al. 2017; Ahmad and Azam 2018; Solanki and Tiwari 2018). Oma87 in A. baumannii is one of the immunogenic proteins that has been assigned via reverse vaccinology as an appropriate vaccine candidate (Chiang et al. 2015). Although function of the OMP in A. baumannii as well as its role in pathogenicity of this bacterium remains to be explored, its expression and localization have been confirmed (Mendez et al. 2012; Chiang et al. 2015). In Pasteurella multocida, this protein is nominated as an appropriate immunogen which could confer protection against pasteurellosis in livestock (Kumar et al. 2013). However, no data about protectivity of A. baumannii Oma87 is available. These evidence persuade us to conduct the current study aiming at evaluation of Oma87 immunogenicity in murine model. In the present study, we expressed and purified the recombinant Oma87 of A. baumannii. The purified protein was then administered into mice in order to trigger antibodies. Active and passive immunizations were assessed in a murine model.",

ProtParam (Gasteiger et al. 2005) (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was harnessed to analyze some physicochemical parameters such as molecular weight, amino acid composition, instability index, theoretical pI, aliphatic index, grand average of hydropathicity and half-life of the protein in mammalian, yeast, and Escherichia coli. SignalP 4.1 (Petersen et al. 2011) (https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) was used to predict the signal peptide and its cleavage site.

PCR reaction was performed with pre-denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 35 thermal cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 40 s, annealing at 62 \u00b0C for 45 s, and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. Amplified PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The amplified gene was cloned into pET28a(+) between BamHI and XhoI restriction sites and was transformed to competent cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3) prepared by calcium chloride (CaCl2) chemical method. The selected clones were confirmed by both PCR and sequencing. The transformed cells were grown in LB supplemented with 70 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm. Then a single colony from an agar plate was transferred to 1 ml of ZYP-5052 medium [for 100 ml:93 ml ZY (10 g N-Z-amine AS Sigma cat. # N4S 17, 5 g yeast extract, 925 ml water), 0.1 ml 1 M MgSO4, 2 ml of 50 \u00d7 5052 (0.5% glycerol, 0.05% glucose, 0.2% \u03b1-lactose), 5 ml 20 \u00d7 NPS (6.6% of (NH4)2SO4, 13.6% of KH2PO4, 14.2% of Na2HPO4 in double-distilled water), plus antibiotic in a microtube and shake at 37 \u00b0C for 6\u20138 h. Over-expression of the protein was achieved by transferring 1 ml fresh culture of bacteria to 100 ml ZYP-5052 + kanamycin and then was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, cooling was carried out on the ice buckets after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2630 rcf for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer B (100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 8 M urea, pH 8) and then was sonicated (5 times, 15 s, 1 min interval) using a sonicator. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,760 rcf for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the debris. The supernatant was loaded on to the Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Germany) affinity column, pre-equilibrated with the buffer B and cell lysate slowly added (3\u20134 column volumes per hour) onto the column. The resin was washed twice with washing buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 8 M urea and 20 mM imidazole at pH 8), and the recombinant protein was eluted with 5 times 250 \u00b5l elution buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 8 M urea and 250 mM imidazole at pH 8). The elution fractions were monitored by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm. The purified protein was analyzed by 9% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Refolding of the purified recombinant protein was carried out via sequential dialysis against PBS (pH 7.4) containing 6, 4, 2 and 0 M urea + 0.5 mM l-arginine at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. The purified protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method (Bradford 1976) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. To validate the recombinant protein expression, western blotting with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-polyhistidine antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) was performed in which, 0.493 \u00b5g of the recombinant protein was loaded onto the SDS-PAGE.",

Based on the name of retrieved protein sequence as well as homology search, we found out that this OMP is BamA. Although its function in A. baumannii remains obscure, this highly conserved OMP has pivotal role in outer membrane protein assembly of Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, BamA structure in E. coli has already been unveiled (Gessmann et al. 2014). Immunoprotectivity of this highly conserved protein against A. baumannii had been recently demonstrated in a murine pneumonia model (Singh et al. 2017). An aliphatic index range of 42.08\u201390.68 revealed a thermostable protein (higher the aliphatic index shows higher the thermostability of the protein). Based on the calculated aliphatic index, Oma87 is a thermostable protein. GRAVY of a protein is related to its solubility properties. The calculated GRAVY (negative value) for Oma87 indicates that the protein is non-polar.",

            "text": "Since this is an outer membrane protein, hydrophobic stretches within these proteins could result in aggregation and formation of the inclusion body where it is overexpressed. Moreover, the existence of signal peptide could promote this phenomenon. Moreover, this protein has four cysteines could form disulfide bonds and therefore has high hydrophobicity. So, this protein was purified in denaturing conditions. Denaturing conditions could disturb structure of proteins consequently their structural epitopes. Hence, the refolding procedure was conducted; however, aggregates were again formed in dialyzing procedure. Based on literature review, adding l-arginine could be helpful for refolding the recombinant protein aggregates (Tsumoto et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2009). A high titer of IgG raised against rOma87 (BamA) reveals its high antigenicity. This finding was in accordance with the previous study on this protein (Singh et al. 2017). Although the amount of recombinant protein administered in the current study is the same as that used in boosters of previous study, the adjuvant as well as route of injection are different (Singh et al. 2017). Whole-cell ELISA results demonstrated that the antibodies triggered against rOma87 (BamA) could recognize the native protein expressed in A. baumannii. In addition, it is revealed this OMP is expressed under in vitro culture condition and is also exposed to these specific antibodies. In general, whole-cell ELISA shows lower absorbance in comparison to the purified protein antigen. It could be due to lower binding sites, exposed to anti-rOma87 antibodies, on bacterial surfaces. Since this antigen is an OMP, it is expected that all residues are not to be accessible for the antibodies raised against rOma87 (BamA). Moreover, other antigenic targets of bacterial cell surface are also present in whole-cell ELISA. It could be expected that removal of non-epitope regions of this immunogen will increase its antigenicity. Moreover, removal of signal peptide as well as non-exposed regions of this antigen could conduct antibodies triggering toward more efficient specific antibodies. Hence, determination of Oma87 (BamA) structure as well as its loops which are exposed in native form would be valuable. Although 3D structure of BamA had been predicted by Singh et al. (2017), topology prediction along with harnessing an integrative in silico approach could improve quality of the predicted model. Recently, structure of Omp34 (a promising antigen of A. baumannii) has been precisely predicted via harnessing an integrative in silico approach (Jahangiri et al. 2018a, b). Pierce into 3D structure of Oma87 (BamA) could help in assigning appropriate exposed antigenic determinant. Active and passive immunizations have been considered as options to be investigated against A. baumannii (McConnell and Pach\u00f3n 2010; Luo et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2015, 2016; Singh et al. 2016; Jahangiri et al. 2019). In the previous study conducted by Singh et al. (2017), active and passive immunization with this protein conferred 80% and 60% protection, respectively against intranasal challenge with LD of A. baumannii. In the present study, to avoid large quantity of bacteria in inoculums, porcine mucin was used. A large quantity of bacteria administration could result in a model of intoxication with endotoxins rather than a reliable infection model (Cross et al. 1993; Buras et al. 2005). Mucin could increase the virulence of bacteria in murine models. This may lead to employing lower doses of bacteria to establish murine sepsis model reflecting more accurately human sepsis. Active immunization showed full protection against 2 \u00d7 LD in the murine sepsis model. Moreover, the active immunization showed higher protection than passive immunization. This is in agreement with previous reports (Huang et al. 2015, 2016). It could be due to the presence of other immune system effectors in active immunization in addition to antibodies. Based on the obtained results and findings of Singh et al. (2017), it seems that the systemic immune response triggered by this antigen is more effective in sepsis model than pneumonia. It could be attributed to role of mucosal immunity had not been considered in the previous investigation. It could be predicted that triggering mucosal immunity could confer higher protection against murine pneumonia caused by A. baumannii. In a recent study on immunogenicity of Omp22, the immunized mice were challenged intraperitoneally with LD of A. baumannii. The survival rate of mice actively immunized with 20 \u00b5g of this OMP was less than 50%; while all mice immunized with 50 \u00b5g of rOmp22 were survived within the follow-up time. Moreover, anti-rOmp22 IgG titers in mice group received 50 \u00b5g of rOmp22 were significantly higher than IgG titers in mice received 20 \u00b5g of this OMP. In our study on rOma87, only 20 \u00b5g of this protein was administered to be investigated. So, it could be deduced that Oma87 (BamA) is a stronger antigen than Omp22 (Huang et al. 2016). Survival results of active and passive immunization imply that this antigen is expressed in the murine model infection. An appropriate vaccine candidate should be highly expressed in infection situation. Although the whole-cell ELISA and challenge results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo expression of Oma87 (BamA) in murine model, its expression level in human infections needs to be explored. The abundance of the protein on bacterial surface as well as its role in various phases of infection could impact on efficacy of the vaccine candidate.",
