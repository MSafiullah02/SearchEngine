His medications included an antihypertensive medication and a proton pump inhibitor. He was a lifelong nonsmoker and worked as a dentist. He had no family history of ILD. His physical exam was significant for dry inspiratory crackles at both bases and normal resting oxygen saturation. His pulmonary function was abnormal with a forced vital capacity of 57 % predicted and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 67 % predicted.

Although most patients with IPF experience a steady decline in lung function over time, some will decline quickly, while others seem stable for many years. Increasingly, we recognize that some patients may also have a more unpredictable course [2]. These patients experience periods of relative stability followed by acute episodes of worsening in their respiratory status [3]. Episodes of acute respiratory decline in IPF can be secondary to complications such as infection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or heart failure [3, 4]. Such episodes of acute respiratory deterioration have been termed AEx of IPF when the cause for the acute worsening cannot be identified. Acute exacerbations likely comprise almost 50 % of these acute respiratory events, and the clinical characteristics and prognosis are indistinguishable from acute exacerbations of known cause. This chapter will discuss only AEx of IPF.",

A survey of providers in the USA suggests that most clinicians believe AEx to be somewhat or very common [9]. The true incidence of AEx remains unknown, and the incidence may vary by country due to different genetic and environmental factors. Largely due to differences in case definition, patient population, sample size, and duration of follow-up, the range of AEx incidence in clinical studies ranges anywhere from 1 % to 24 % [3, 4]. The largest and probably most robust study of 461 patients with IPF that were followed longitudinally over 3 years found a 1- and 3-year incidence of 14.2 % and 20.7 %, respectively [4].",

A few risk factors have been identified, including lower baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted and having been a nonsmoker [4]. It seems likely that patients with more severe IPF are more likely to develop clinically significant AEx of disease, and this perception is supported by the increased incidence of AEx that was observed in the only study of advanced disease reported in the literature to date, namely, STEP-IPF [14]. Precipitating factors such as surgical lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have also been reported [11, 15\u201320]. The occurrence of AEx after videoscopic-assisted surgical lung biopsy is particularly intriguing, as the exacerbation appears to be more pronounced in the lung that was ventilated (i.e., the nonsurgical side receiving single lung ventilation) [19]. However, the precise relationship between these precipitating factors and AEx remains unclear.",

            "text": "Occult aspiration of gastric contents has been suggested as a possible trigger or cause of AEx of IPF. GER is nearly universal in patients with IPF [26, 27] and is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration [28, 29]. BAL pepsin levels, a biomarker for aspiration of gastric secretions, were shown to be elevated in a subset of patients with AEx of IPF [30]. In addition, patients with asymmetric IPF on HRCT scan had a higher rate of GER and AEx compared to patients with non-asymmetric disease, suggesting a role for GER and occult aspiration in a subset of patients with IPF [31].",

However, in a prospective study of AEx of IPF (n = 47), acute viral infection, as determined by the most current genomics-based methodologies, was found in only 9 % of this cohort [35].

Unfortunately, both warfarin and pirfenidone have subsequently been shown to have no impact on the rate of AEx, suggesting that the initial observations were inaccurate [51, 57].",

Perhaps we should be more critical of the use of corticosteroids to treat AEx of IPF. There are two distinct viewpoints regarding the role of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF. The first viewpoint is that AEx of IPF is histopathologically similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by DAD and acute lung injury [59] and should, therefore, be treated similarly to ARDS. In the ARDS literature, the mortality benefit of corticosteroids is unclear [60\u201365]. In one study, increased mortality was observed in ARDS patients treated with delayed corticosteroids (after 14 days) [65]. If we were to follow the ARDS paradigm, most clinicians would not use corticosteroids in the treatment of AEx of IPF. A second viewpoint for the role of corticosteroids in IPF is that some patients with AEx of IPF have organizing pneumonia on biopsy [49]. Organizing pneumonia is generally thought to be steroid responsive, and it may be that the pathobiology is different enough between ARDS and AEx of IPF to warrant continued use of corticosteroids. There remains equipoise on the efficacy of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF, and this treatment intervention should be studied more carefully [42].",

As many patients with AEx of IPF will not meet the current consensus criteria due to missing data, it may be more useful clinically to define AEx by less stringent criteria. It seems likely that the prevention and treatment of AEx of IPF must focus on both disease-specific (e.g., anti-fibrotic therapies) and non-disease-specific (e.g., vaccination, prevention of stress) areas. The next decade will hopefully answer many of the unresolved questions concerning AEx of IPF.",
