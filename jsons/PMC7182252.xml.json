For SOT, similar concerns regarding vaccine response in the early posttransplant period exist and chemoprophylaxis should be considered, although recommendations regarding the timing of this strategy are lacking.28 Season-long prophylaxis has been evaluated in a randomized trial of SOT and HCT and showed reduction in culture- or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza, although this approach is not universally used and may be targeted to periods of high influenza virus circulation.29 Antiviral resistance may emerge with widespread prophylaxis; drug resistance patterns of circulating strains should be considered when initiating prophylaxis and/or preemptive therapy.",

            "text": "In adult HCT and hematologic malignancy patients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, use of aerosolized ribavirin was associated with decreased mortality. Oral or IV ribavirin although not statistically significant as the effect was smaller.11\n,\n12 Of note, some data suggest pediatric HCT recipients with RSV have little morbidity and mortality even without ribavirin therapy.35 Current international guidelines recommend aerosolized or systemic (oral or IV) ribavirin with intravenous immunoglogulin (IVIG) in patients with RSV upper respiratory tract infection undergoing allogeneic HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients with risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection, and allogeneic HCT patients with lower respiratory tract infection.36 Recommendations for ribavirin administration for HCT and SOT recipients, and oncology patients are outlined in Table 21.1\n. Most data and guidance for use of ribavirin are in HCT and oncology; few studies have clearly demonstrated efficacy in SOT recipients, and most data are in lung transplant when both oral and IV ribavirin have been used,37 For HCT and oncology patients, high-risk situations include patients with lymphopenia; additional risk factors, such as smoking history and use of high-dose total body irradiation, could be used to further risk-stratify patients. In general, aerosolized ribavirin is reserved for subjects with virologically confirmed (BAL positive for RSV) lower respiratory tract infection. It is administered by small-particle aerosol from a solution containing the drug at a concentration of 20 mg/mL sterile water via aerosol for 2 to 20 hours/day, or at a concentration of 60 mg/mL water over 2 hours 3 times daily. Aerosol administration results in high levels of ribavirin in the secretions, with levels exceeding 1000 \u03bcM and little systemic absorption. The potential environmental release of ribavirin has caused concern in hospital personnel because of the potential teratogenicity of ribavirin and thus exposure is contraindicated in pregnant women because of its teratogenic potential. Administration of ribavirin via a ventilator, using a high-dose, short-duration method of drug delivery or with a vacuum-exhausted treatment hood, results in minimal or no detectable ribavirin in the rooms of treated children.",

The impact of other factors such as viral-specific risk scores, location of infection and viral load, need to be evaluated. In pediatric patients, diagnostic PCR should be considered on all transplant candidates, regardless of symptoms, and transplant delay should be considered, if feasible, with ongoing symptoms or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.",
