TB has remained consistently at number eight on the African ranking. These diseases spread most easily where there are weak health systems and poor infrastructure. However, all can be brought under control. Interventions such as spraying and (often impregnated) bed nets reduce the incidence of malaria. The development and distribution of anti-retroviral therapy means symptomatic AIDS illness can be suppressed. TB can be cured (WHO 2010) . The game changer for all these diseases would be the development of effective (or for TB, more effective) vaccines (PATH 2015) . Lower respiratory infections and diarrheal disease account for significant health loss in SSA, although their relative disease burdens are lower than 20 years ago. The expected improvement in living conditions and wealth will reduce incidence of diarrhea (e.g., clean water and hygiene) and respiratory infections (e.g., not using wood, coal, or paraffin for cooking and having better ventilated housing -the ventilation will also cut transmission of TB). Improvements in access to health care will reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality. Deaths from measles have fallen out of the top ten diseases.
