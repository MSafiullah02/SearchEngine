Several factors contributing to the emergence of recent epidemics have been identified, including genetic adaptations of the microbial agent, international travel, human susceptibility to infection, population growth, an aging population, climate and weather changes, and expanding vector habitats [2\u20135]. Four recent examples of disease emergences are the viral infections such as Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the recently described novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, which represent new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications [6\u20138]. However, the most important newest example of an emergent infectious disease is HIV infection, which emerged a century ago in a primate host(s), and subsequently spread within the human population.",

In this pre-HAART era, the coexistence of HIV infection and systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis was rarely observed given that these two diseases are CD4+ T cell\u2013mediated process and HIV targets CD4+ T cell, therefore reducing the risk of development of these rheumatic diseases. After the introduction of HAART, rheumatic complications had a significant decline, including DILS, ReA, PsA, and myositis [13\u201315] (see Table 1).",

In the first study, Yen et al. reported on the incidence of AIDS in a nation-wide HIV/AIDS patient (PLWHA) cohort in Taiwan and compared with the general population. An interesting observation was the lower risk for development of AS despite a high prevalence of HLA-B27 in Taiwanese people (5%). In contrast, PLWHA who received HAART had higher standardized incidence rates (SIRs) for psoriasis, AHA, and uveitis, while those that did not receive HAART had higher SIRs for Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, psoriasis, RA, SLE, and other autoimmune disorders. Lebrun et al. also conducted an epidemiologic study in a French nation-wide HIV cohort to estimate the prevalence of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (IADs) among patients living with HIV (PLHIV) in the HAART era (from January 2000 to July 2013), and to describe their occurrence according to HAART onset, the immune-virological status, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus coinfection. Published reports showed that several IADs including psoriasis, sarcoidosis, RA, ankylosis spondylitis (AS), Graves\u2019 disease, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis (MG), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and chronic inflammatory bowel disease were the most prevalent diseases. Majority of patients (59%) developed IAD after HIV infection with a mean delay of 10.6 \u00b1 6.4 years. In addition, in patients developing IAD after the diagnosis of HIV infection, 572 (70%) were on HAART and 419 of them (73%) had undetectable HIV viral load. Comparing data from the Taiwan and French studies, some geographical variability in terms of IADs is observed but both studies confirmed previous reports in the literature concerning the relationship between HIV/AIDS and rheumatic disorders.",

This was more striking for both psoriasis and PsA in sub-Saharan African countries in which the incidence and prevalence of both disorders were low despite the presence of the risk allele for psoriasis HLA-CW6. This, however, drastically changed following the advent of HIV in which both disorders were increasingly seen in African populations [12, 21\u201324]. A similar situation occurred in Asian populations in which both psoriasis and PsA were of low prevalence, only to increase following the HIV pandemic. Post-HAART, both psoriasis and PsA have diminished in Africa and Asia.",

On the other hand, the presence of low titer rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) in patients with HIV may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of RA. HIV patients may also exhibit a high proportion of RF and CCP antibodies, which decrease after initiation of HAART suggesting that HIV is capable of inducing autoantibodies [27, 28].",
