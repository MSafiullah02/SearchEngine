In Germany, in particular, traffic is increasing substantially, and between 1997 and 2015 passenger services are predicted to double (Table 1\n). This would mean an increase in air transport\u2019s share of the passenger transport market from 4% to 7% (Table 2\n). Such levels of actual and predicted growth have led to numerous enlargements of the infrastructure on the ground. Not only are measures to increase the capacities of airports in German conurbations being taken: the number of airports that can be used by larger jets (more than 100 passengers) will increase significantly across the country. This fact underlines the competitive nature of airport infrastructure provision.",

On the one hand, existing small airfields have been extended step by step, facilitating eventual conversion into regional or even international airports with scheduled traffic or charter flights. Dortmund, Friedrichshafen and, after unification in 1990, Erfurt are examples of this type of airport expansion in Germany. On the other hand, completely new airports have been built in regions which previously had no such facility (e.g. M\u00fcnster/Osnabr\u00fcck and Paderborn/Lippstadt). In the last few years, many other airfields and airports have been trying to establish themselves, at such a rate that it is necessary to consider whether this \u2018predict and provide\u2019 approach is sustainable (Graham and Guyer, 2000).",

The ownership of newcomer airports in particular is, however, often different from that of the established airports, which are traditionally owned by the local authorities and often also by the federal states. Only in Frankfurt, Hamburg and D\u00fcsseldorf do private investors hold shares. Three newcomer airports are privately owned or operated, all by foreign investors (Lahr and Schwerin/Parchim by PlaneStation Group plc/UK and Niederrhein by Airport Network BV/NL). In three cases, established airports have shares in neighbouring airports which they are trying to develop: Frankfurt and Hahn (called Frankfurt\u2013Hahn), D\u00fcsseldorf and M\u00f6nchengladbach (called D\u00fcsseldorf\u2013M\u00f6chengladbach) and Stuttgart and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden. The disadvantage of this for the smaller airports is their role as a dependent satellite airport, although they do benefit from better funding and support with know-how and second-hand equipment. Another very new type of ownership is the public\u2013private partnership (e.g. Nordholz and Bitburg).",

Four different corporate strategies were identified, often to be found in combination. The first type is the satellite airport, which alleviates the capacity problems of a nearby larger airport (e.g. M\u00f6nchengladbach). The second type is the 24-hour cargo airport (e.g. Nordholz and Lahr), which is located away from centres of population and offers unrestricted access for all aircraft (especially for noisy air freighters at night). The third type is what Cidell (2003) termed aeroplex, that is an airport or airfield in a rural area in combination with an industrial park (e.g. Zweibr\u00fccken or Memmingen). The last, but the most favoured, type is the low-cost hub (e.g. Hahn or Niederrhein).",

Niederrhein Airport, situated between Dutch and West German conurbations, will possibly develop in a similar way. All the other aspiring airports have problems with attracting airlines, however. An extreme example is the former Soviet airbase at Cochstedt, which has already been closed, in spite of federal state and local authority investment to the tune of \u20ac45 million. Here, the \u2018job-machine\u2019 failed, and other airports are likely to go the same way.",

At the moment there is one runway of only 1500 m, and combined with the difficult topographical situation this limits the operation of larger aircraft. In 2002, a Boeing 737\u2013700 (to Majorca) was only able to operate with payload restrictions, i.e. a reduced number of passengers. The airport operator, owned by the local authorities and the federal state of Hesse, is therefore planning to build a completely new 2500 m runway by 2008. The problem is that there are four nearby competitors: Paderborn/Lippstadt and Erfurt, and Frankfurt and Hannover, which both can be reached by high speed train (ICE) in 1.5 h. Nevertheless, Kassel-Calden is being promoted by the government of Hesse because Frankfurt, which is located in the same state, has increasing capacity problems.",

The problem in this case is that Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has only 1.8 million inhabitants, and neither local industry nor coastal tourism generate sufficient demand for air transport. The only two scheduled connections from Rostock-Laage and Neubrandenburg to Munich are both subsidised.

The problem in this case is that the airfield lies only 50 km to the south of Leipzig/Halle Airport (which has two runways of 3600 m and 2500 m) in Saxony, which has recently been enlarged and has spare capacity. This has resulted in a conflict between the two federal states, because Leipzig/Halle is trying to promote a daily turboprop-flight to London City (with a subsidy of \u20ac1 million per year), which might have to be discontinued due to an occupancy rate of only 40% in 2003.",

The situation in Germany is unique, as seven different air forces (and NATO) have given up redundant airbases since the end of the Cold War: US Air Force, Royal Air Force, Arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air (France), Canadian Air Force, Soviet/Russian Air Force, Luftwaffe (German Air Force) and Nationale Volksarmee (East German Air Force). As a result, there has been a sharp decline in the number of airbases. In 1990, 72 airbases with longer runways were still in operation, whereas today there are only 32 (Table 4\n). In addition, permanent civil operations are also allowed on a few German Air Force airbases (Bundeswehr, 2003). Twenty-nine airbases were converted for civil and general aviation and only 15 were closed, to be used for other kinds of development. Some of them were built over with industrial estates, but alternative use often poses problems for local authorities: they might be advised to look at the solutions in the UK, which has had much more experience in this sector (Gallent et al., 2000). A special problem, not only in the former GDR, is the neglected deposits of toxic waste (including ammunition), which is an obstacle to the re-use of airbases.",

Many communities came to terms with the negative aspects of airbases and benefited for decades from the advantages they offered, especially in West Germany. The closure of the sites in the 1990s thus came as a shock to them: \u201cthe loss of the revenue source was seen as disastrous\u201d (Cidell, 2003, p. 93). In the following years, local authorities made great efforts to stimulate the local economy. One of the first ideas was to convert the airbases into airfields or airports for civilian use, but in most cases the regional authorities overestimated the potential for this, tending to disregard the disadvantages of the airbases\u2019 location. As Cidell (2003) notes, the bases were originally sited for reasons of military strategy rather than for the needs of civil aviation. Cidell also ascertained that in the United States many bases which had been converted to another kind of use, but still contained runways, later took up the idea of a civilian airport again. In Germany the situation is exactly the same. At many former airbases which were converted to uses other than civil aviation, the option for a developing airport still exists and could be revived.",

It recommends enlarging satellite airports and integrating them into the regional transport system. Additionally, it suggests that international airports should give financial aid to the satellite airports in their region. Since these airports lie within the responsibility of the federal states, however, these objectives are not included in the latest national transport plan (Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing, 2003). For this reason, and due to coalition agreements between the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party, the Federal Government\u2019s statements remain fairly vague and inconsistent. On the one hand, they emphasise that the substitution of air transport by rail transport is necessary, while, on the other hand, they call for the extension of already existing airports as far as local and environmental conditions will allow.

It also demands better air traffic management at hubs and the use of bigger aircraft. In contrast, the European Parliament is more moderate. It supports legislation in favour of citizens suffering from aircraft noise, though EU legislation plays an important role in the support of newcomer airports.

This is often true, but the chances of attracting scheduled flights to a domestic hub like Frankfurt or Munich are very poor, since the established airports are strong competitors in this field and the ICE high speed train network is displacing more and more domestic flights. Hannover Airport is a good example: in 1992, eight domestic destinations were offered; in 2004 only three remained. Many domestic connections from small airports were also discontinued in the last few years, most of them to Berlin (from Kiel, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, Siegerland, Augsburg and Hahn). Small airports in Germany usually require subsidies to promote traditional scheduled flights.

Humphreys and Francis (2002, p. 253) noted this in the UK, but it applies to Germany, too. A particular problem for German airports which impedes the acquisition of new airlines and destinations is the dominating role of Lufthansa. Nearly every German carrier which owns aircraft suitable for scheduled flights to smaller airports (18\u201370 passengers) depends on the former flag carrier. Either they belong to the Lufthansa group (like Eurowings) or they are a franchise partner (Lufthansa Regional, formerly Team Lufthansa), or they are at least partners in the Lufthansa mileage programme. According to these criteria, only two small carriers are fully independent. Because other domestic or foreign carriers are normally not interested in operating regional aircraft, some airports have asked local business aviation carriers to offer scheduled flights (e.g. in Kiel, Neubrandenburg, Kassel and Siegerland), but they have had only limited success, due to the small and uncomfortable planes (e.g. Beech 1900, Metroliner or King Air 200) and size-related marketing problems.",

In recent years, nearly every small airport had several seasonal flights to Majorca or to other Mediterranean destinations, but that was a temporary boom. On account of the small catchment areas, the off-season demand was too low. It was often impossible to fill an aircraft with a seating capacity of over 100. This entailed expensive triangle flights, and in some cases positioning flights from the carriers\u2019 home bases were also necessary. Sometimes the planes were chartered by local travel agents who were unable to cope with the difficult circumstances, and this resulted in many flights being cancelled at short notice. In 2003, the main tour operators TUI and Thomas Cook also decided to withdraw from small airports, and to concentrate on flights from the airports in conurbations.

The demand for industrial estates near the airport is therefore also low. Many remote airports had the unrealistic dream of filling several air freighters every week, forgetting that even at the hubs most of the freight is carried as additional cargo on passenger jets. The newcomer airports are also often less successful than the data indicate, since most of the air cargo is only trucked to the next cargo hub (for example, at Hahn the figure is approximately 80%). Hopes of attracting integrators were also disappointed. These companies have already chosen their hubs in Europe (UPS in Cologne, FedEx in Paris, DHL in Brussels or TNT in Li\u00e8ge), but airports with free capacity might have the prospect of developing as a secondary hub, especially in the case of integrators having to relocate due to night flight or noise restrictions.",

Another positive fact is the variety of passenger types: this was confirmed by a survey of low-cost passengers at newcomer airports carried out by the author (Table 5\n).

The main problem is that they demand subsidies, which Ryanair\u2019s CEO freely admits: \u201cIt is an open fact that some airports pay us to fly there\u2026\u201d (Parliament of Ireland, 2003). Such financial aid (more than \u20ac100,000 per year for one destination) is not normally allowed in the European Union, but it is defined as a \u2018marketing grant\u2019. Additionally, the airlines demand lower landing fees. Full-service carriers have meanwhile taken airports to court on this issue. The European Commission also reviewed the legality of subsidies, and the following recent decisions may decelerate the success of the low-cost airlines:  \n\u2022Charleroi. In February 2004, the European Commission \u201ctook a major decision of significance for the future of air transport\u201d (European Commission, 2004a). It curtailed the advantages granted to Ryanair by Brussels South Charleroi Airport (BSCA) and the Walloon Region. Ryanair has four aircraft based in Charleroi, serving about 12 million passengers a year with 12 destinations. It has to pay back illegal subsidies amounting to more than \u20ac3 million. The Commission has not issued a general ban on agreements between regional airports and low-cost airlines, but decided that the following forms of aid could not be authorised: reduced airport charges, reduced ground handling fees, aid provided for existing routes and one-shot incentives provided for the opening of new routes which do not take account of the actual costs. In the future, subsidies for point-to-point European routes are only allowed for a five-year period: they must correspond to a \u2018maximum intensity\u2019 of 50% and, crucially, must be available to any airline.\u2022\nStrasbourg. In September 2003, the French appeals court at Nancy barred subsidies being paid to Ryanair by the Bas-Rhin Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The subsidies amounted to \u20ac1.4 million to set up two daily roundtrip flights between Strasbourg and London Stansted. In the suit lodged by Air France, the court ruled that this was illegal state aid and an improper use of public funds.\u2022\nAirport names. Many low-cost airlines renamed small airports to convey that they were less remote. In December 2003, the German appeals court at Cologne prohibited misleading advertising and denied Ryanair the right to call Niederrhein Airport \u2018Niederrhein (D\u00fcsseldorf)\u2019, but the prohibition applied only to this case and not to \u2018Hamburg\u2013L\u00fcbeck\u2019 or \u2018Leipzig\u2013Altenburg\u2019.\u2022\nPrice transparency. In September 2003, the German district court at Hannover ruled that low-cost airlines may not promote flights at dumping prices if they offer fewer than 10% of all seats at this price.\u2022\nAir passengers\u2019 rights. In January 2004, the Council and the European Parliament adopted the proposal of a new regulation to protect the rights of air passengers (European Commission, 2004b).

In some cases, non-existent airlines tried to fool airports by demanding subsidies in advance. Dependence on only one airline is often another disregarded risk (e.g. in L\u00fcbeck). Further disadvantages a small airport has to consider if it wants to run low-cost flights are: extremely short turnarounds (under 25 min), late arrivals due to the high utilisation of the planes (up to eight flights per day) and the need for sufficient public transport, taxi capacities and car parks. Since 2003, the chances of newcomer airports attracting low-cost airlines have been reduced, because the new German low-cost carriers Germanwings (Lufthansa group), Hapag Lloyd Express (TUI group) and Gexx decided to fly from established airports like Cologne, Hannover or Stuttgart.

            "text": "Assessing the sustainability of transport and, in particular, of aviation constitutes a new field of research (Graham and Guyer, 1999). Most existing studies analyse the transport sector as a whole (Black, 1998). In recent years, several catalogues of indicators have been developed, especially in Switzerland (Swiss Confederation, 2001), but they are difficult to apply if only a small element of the transport system is to be analysed. In checking the sustainability of newcomer airports, modified objectives (written below in italics) are required. A rough survey yields the following results:  \n\u2022Low-cost flights from newcomer airports do nothing to reduce traffic, emissions and noise. They encourage growth in mobility (Graham and Guyer, 1999). Several recent but non-representative samples from universities or consultants show that a major part of the low-cost traffic is additional traffic, since approximately 40% of the passengers only travel because of the low price.\u2022\nTravel distances and travelling time are increasing. Due to the low-cost boom, more and more passengers choose the cheapest rather than the nearest airport. For example, 40% of the passengers from London to L\u00fcbeck travel on to Hamburg. This means approximately 60 extra kilometres both in the air and on the ground.\u2022In contrast to most of the bigger airports, the modal integration of newcomer airports is bad. They provide large parking areas, but so far none of them has more than a bus connection to the cities they (purport to) serve.\u2022The assessment of land use should differentiate between airports with new (or enlarged) runways, terminals or parking areas on the one hand, and converted airports with an intelligent re-use of a former airbase on the other hand.\u2022One main goal of a sustainable process should be the participation of the public. Thus, the involvement of all stakeholders \u201cis a central element in achieving airport development objectives\u201d (Thomas and Lever, 2003, p. 208). Although many action groups against noise at the established airports are disappointed, these airports often have much better communication with local residents than the smaller ones. The most comprehensive participation programme in Germany was the \u2018mediation\u2019 on the expansion of Frankfurt Airport from 1998 to 2000.\u2022It should not be forgotten that airports in peripheral regions could be an instrument for ensuring social equity. They improve accessibility and contribute towards addressing the concern of the EU \u201cthat geographical location should not be the primary determinant of the life chances\u201d (Graham and Guyer, 1999, p. 166).\u2022It is essential to consider that sustainability \u201calso invokes a concern with long-term economic development\u201d (Graham, 2000, p. 77). The reduction of market distortions is therefore a main goal of economic sustainability. To avert high-cost but unused airport infrastructure, a realistic economic assessment of all investments and subsidies is required. In Germany, the state intervenes in many ways. It provides public funds for airport infrastructure and staff, \u2018marketing grants\u2019 for low-cost airlines, and financial support for scheduled flights to regional airports (in conformity with EU-law). It also provides the surface access, levies no taxes on jet fuel, and does not charge VAT on tickets for international flights. The next section expands on this economic development point.\n",

Whether aspiring smaller airports will generate the same number of jobs cannot yet be ascertained, as hardly any research has been done on this subject to date: it is indeed questionable whether they can provide jobs to the same extent (Graham and Guyer, 2000).

Yet an airport is only one of many location factors. Airports can contribute to economic development and their prestige value is high, but they do not guarantee the economic prosperity of a region.

            "text": "Although air transport within the EU has been liberalised to a great extent, the Council Regulation 2408/92 Access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (European Community, 1992) allows member states to subsidise routes to smaller airports. A member state \u201cmay impose a public service obligation\u201d (continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing) in respect of particular scheduled air services. It must either be a route to an airport in a \u201cperipheral or development region\u201d or a \u201cthin route to any regional airport.\u201d However, such routes must be \u201cconsidered vital for the economic development of the region\u201d (European Community, 1992, Article 4, 1 (a)). If a scheduled service complies with these requirements, the member state may pay a reimbursement to the air carrier. The rules are widely interpretable and nonspecific. For instance, except for 35 \u2018category 1 airports\u2019, every EU airport is a \u2018regional airport\u2019. Whereas other member states mainly subsidise routes to remote regions or to islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Azores, Hebrides), Germany (i.e. the federal states) supports air transport to regions with reasonable rail access, so criticism of the high subsidies for scheduled connections (e.g. Rostock\u2013Munich) may appear justified. That said, the access of disadvantaged areas (like Mecklenburg\u2013Western Pomerania) to wider networks is a basic social equity objective (Graham, 2003b).",

            "text": "The main reason for the uncoordinated process of airport capacity expansion in Germany is that the responsibility for aviation lies in the hands of the federal states. They do not normally dovetail their airport planning, and no detailed nationwide concept for air transport exists (in contrast to surface transport). It would seem, however, that some kind of airport development planning by the federal government is imperative. This would require a far-reaching legislative amendment, but a national strategy would be able to develop airport capacities more efficiently and could prevent the above-mentioned process. The main goal should be a comprehensive geographical approach instead of spatially limited federal state planning. No parallel development of neighbouring \u2018newcomer airports\u2019 should be allowed if none of them will have sufficient demand. In addition to the environmental impact assessment which is regulated by European and national law, assessments of the wider sustainability and economic development impacts of each airport should be made compulsory. State intervention and subsidies of any kind ought to be reduced. There does not appear to be a necessity to create more airport capacity outside the urbanised European core regions. Due to the fact that a \u201csubstantial number of airports \u2026 have adequate capacity for the foreseeable future\u201d (Graham and Guyer, 1999, p. 169), in many countries \u201cenough airport capacity exists but not where the airlines want it\u201d (Humphreys and Francis, 2002, p. 249). Like several NGOs, however, the state should also question whether new airports and runways are really required, and consider whether the forecasted demand for air travel is artificial due to the subsidised ticket prices. Airport capacity planning should always be demand-orientated, so aspiring airports should grow step by step in a suitable modular way. All this could reduce prestige-driven and ineffectual investments, land consumption and other non-sustainable impacts.",
