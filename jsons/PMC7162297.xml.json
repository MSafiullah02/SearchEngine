            "text": "At the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, there was a widespread belief that science and in particular medicine had progressed so far that Nature could be brought under complete control. It seemed that healthcare and pharmacology were in the position to prevent or to cure almost all diseases. In the 1980s, for example, the pharmaceutical industry stopped the search for new antibiotic drugs that would be badly needed nowadays in the light of the universal capabilities of bacteria to develop resistance factors. At about the same time previously unknown or unnoticed virus transmitted infectious human diseases appeared: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) and four related other strains of filoviridae, as well as severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) brought about by SARS coronavirus. Caused by prions and not by a virus is been bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Nevertheless, it gave rise to an equally serious new epidemic. These and other cases as well as the consequences of the \u201cantivaccination movement\u201d 1, 2, for example, the recent reoccurrence of pertussis and measles, revived a need of reliable models in epidemiology. In particular, the recent Ebola epidemic starting in December 2013 in West Africa 3 initiated a new boom in theoretical work on infectious disease dynamics 4. In PLoS Currents Outbreaks I counted 27 articles between the first publication on the recent Ebola epidemics on May 02, 2014 until March 09, 2015. In December 2014, researchers became aware that the predictions made 3 months earlier, in Fall 2014, apparently overstated the numbers of cases and deaths. A recent theoretical paper aims at an analysis of the prediction errors and provides suggestions how to make better forecasts 5. In this essay, we shall be concerned with the predictive power of one frequently used model denoted as susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010removed (SEIR) model, and try to analyze typical general problems of predictions from early stages of exponentially growing systems to the final outcomes of the processes. In the focus are the model inherent limitations of reliabilities and not the lack of information or external problems like insufficient data or the uncertainty about the effectiveness of intervention strategies or countermeasures.",

The determination of the second parameter C is tricky, in particular for small N\n0/C because the first and the second coefficient of the series expansion are needed and the equations for the fit of C are commonly ill\u2010conditioned. Unfortunately small N\n0 and large C, being tantamount to a few infected individuals\u2014in extreme but not uncommon cases we have N\n0 = 1\u2014and a comparatively large population of susceptible individuals, are almost always the case in the spread of epidemics. For very good reasons, Aaron King et al. 5 emphasize the requirement of highly reliable data and sophisticated high\u2010level stochastic methods for parameter estimations and potential error predictions from the early phase of an exponentially growing system to a final situation when the process is under control. The problem is very general and not restricted to epidemiology. The politically reasonable but scientifically unacceptable flaw in the predictions of the famous Club of Rome 7 is precisely of the same kind: You cannot extrapolate from the initial phase of an exponentially growing process to the final situation unless additional information is or additional data are available.",

The model describes infection dynamics in a population of initially susceptible individuals and attributes four different states to the people: S means susceptible to infection, E implies exposed and infected but not yet showing the symptoms and not being infectious, I stands for being infected, showing the symptoms and being infectious, and eventually R stands for the number of individuals being out of the game by either being recovered and immune to further infection or being dead.

Because of the conservation relation, s + i + e + r = C, the model has three independent variables. To take into account intrinsic stochastic effects, the SEIR model can be formulated as a renewal process 4 that is frequently used in theoretical epidemiology 8. To visualize fluctuations, we shall consider here the expectation values embedded in the one\u2010standard deviation band derived from numerical simulations of the chemical master equation of mechanism (3) 9. The results are shown in Figure 2: As expected the solution curves of the deterministic approach lie within the one\u2010standard deviation band but do not exactly coincide with the expectation values E(x), x \u2261 s,e,i or r\u2014exact coincidence can only be expected for first order or linear processes 10 and, indeed, the step (3a) is corresponding to a bimolecular second order reaction. The SEIR mechanism contains two\u2010step autocatalysis: S + I \u2192 E + I \u2192 2 I resulting from (3a) and (3b). One special property of an autocatalytic system concerns the requirement of a non\u2010zero concentration of the autocatalyst as no reaction will take place otherwise. In the language of epidemiology this fact is trivial: There is no outbreak without infectious individuals. Autocatalysis gives also rise to a number of features, which are uncommon in conventional chemical kinetics. One property that is relevant for the problem of prediction will be discussed in detail in the next paragraph. It concerns the longtime result, which in chemistry is commonly a single state that does not depend on initial conditions. In case of autocatalysis, however, the final state can be a one\u2010dimensional (1D) manifold and the particular marginally stable stationary points depend on the initial values of the variables (Figure 3; see also a somewhat humoristic but mathematically serious analysis of the equilibria of epimemiological models and their stability see 11). In the SEIR and as well in the simpler susceptile\u2010infectious\u2010recoverd (SIR) model,\n1The SIR model is distiguished from the SEIR model by the omission of the state \u201cexposed.\u201d It contains one\u2010step autocatalysis, S + I \u2192 2 I , and has many features in common with the SEIR model, in particular, the outcome of the SIR process depends also on the initial conditions (see next paragraph). the final outcome in the sense of the residual \u201csusceptibles,\u201d \nlim\u2061t\u2192\u221e S(t)  =  S\u221e, is a function of the number of initially infected people expressed by I(0).",

For simplicity, we replace the numbers of individuals by normalized variables s \u21d2 s/C, i \u21d2 i/C, r \u21d2 r/C such that s + i + r = 1.

Stability analysis yields stable points in the range \n0 \u2264 s\u00af < s\u00afcr and unstable points for \ns\u00afcr < s\u00af \u2264 1, where \ns\u00afcr = \u03b3/\u03b2. In Figure 4, it is shown how the initial ratio of susceptible to recovered or here better immune individuals determines the final number of people that were affected by the epidemic: The more susceptibles are initially present, the smaller is the number of individuals, which remain spared from the disease. Moreover, in the range \n0 \u2264 s\u00af < s\u00afcrno epidemic can occur and this has a straightforward consequence for vaccination: If the fraction of immune people, r/(r + s), is above 1 \u2212 \ns\u00afcr, the population cannot be invaded by the proliferating disease but, of course, the nonvaccinated individual can still be infected.

For R\n0 > 1, the epidemic is spreading whereas R\n0 < 1 implies that the infections are under control. The primary goal of politics and healthcare is to drive \u03b2(t) below one.

Trajectories of individual epidemics, \u03d1(t), calculated by the simple SIR model are shown on the unit simplex S\n3, \u03d1(t) = {s(t), i(t), r(t)} with s + i + r = 1. Every trajectory starts at t = 0 at the right end and progresses with increasing time to the left end that corresponds to the limit t \u2192 \u221e. The initial conditions are given by s\n0 = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, i\n0 = \u03b4, and r\n0 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1, with \u03b4 = 0.001 and \u03b1 = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4, or in other words a population of \u03b1 susceptible and 1 \u2212 \u03b1 immune individuals is infected by a small fraction of diseased people. The number of infectious individual increases, passes through a maximum at \ns\u00afcr = \u03b3/\u03b2, and for long times converges to limt\n\u2192\u221e\ni(t) = 0, the disease has disappeared. Parameters: \u03b2 = 3, \u03b3 = 1, and \ns\u00afcr = 1/3.",
