The structure also revealed that residues 168\u2010172 of the FGF19 are in close proximity with the NT at the interaction interface of FGF19 and G1A8. The Leu169 residue and the NT together form hydrophobic interactions with Tyr51 and Pro57 from light chain CDR (LCDR) 2 (Figure 2A\u2010C). The electron density for the FGF19 CT (residues 173\u2010216) is invisible, likely due to its intrinsic flexibility.32, 33A stretch of roughly 8 residues (residues 38\u201045) of the FGF19 NT engage extensive interactions with all six CDR loops from both the VH and VL of G1A8 through a mix of hydrophobic and polar contacts (Figure 2C and Table S2). The side chain of FGF19 NT residue Trp38 is anchored in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ala33, Ser52, Ser57, Tyr59, Gln102, and Leu104 from heavy chain CDR (HCDR) 1\u20103, while Arg45 of FGF19 on the other side engages salt bridge interactions with Glu103 and Asp52 from HCDR3 and LCDR2, respectively (Figure 2C). Indeed, an FGF19 Trp38Ala mutant had reduced binding affinity for G1A8, and Arg45Ala mutant completely lost the binding (Figure 2D), confirming the essentiality of these interactions. Arg45 also makes additional hydrogen bond interactions with Asn100 from HCDR3 of G1A8 (Figure 2C). G1A8\u2019s parental Ab 31A3 has a Val at this same position (Figure 1A); this difference likely accounts for 31A3\u2019s lower affinity than G1A8.",

The multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and lenvatinib are the only two FDA approved first\u2010line treatments for HCC. However, sorafenib lacks efficient inhibition activity against FGFR4,35 and lenvatinib shows much more potent inhibition activity for vascular endothelial growth factor receptors than for FGFRs.36, 37 It is therefore reasonable to surmise that these agents might be ineffective for the treatment of patients with aberrant FGF19\u2010FGFR4 signaling axis. Increased FGF19 expression was found in HCC patients, and as many as 48% of liver tumors were positive for FGF19 expression.15, 17 Moreover, after surgical resection of liver tumors, HCC patients still have higher serum FGF19 levels than healthy individuals,16 and most HCC patients experience disease recurrence even after tumor resection, suggesting that a supra\u2010physiological level of FGF19 might induce excessive cell proliferation and drive HCC development. Hence, a therapeutic strategy specifically targeting FGF19 that could inhibit the excessive cell proliferation induced by FGF19 during HCC development may also protect patients from HCC recurrence.",

The crystal structure of FGF19\u2019s CT tail bound to soluble KLB has been determined,41 whereas the structure of the ternary complex of FGF19\u2010FGFR4\u2010KLB is yet to be solved. A recently solved crystal structure of FGF23 in complex with its receptor FGFR1c and co\u2010receptor \u03b1\u2010klotho (KLA) revealed that KLA tethers FGFR1c and FGF23 to form a stable ternary complex. In the complex, the globular NT region and the rod\u2010like CT region of FGF23 are critical for binding to FGFR1c and KLA, respectively. Heparin sulfate (HS) is required for the dimerization of the 1:1:1 FGF23\u2010KLA\u2010FGFR1c complex; the FGF23 signaling through FGFR1c depends on both KLA binding and HS\u2010mediated dimerization.42 It remains to be determined whether FGF19, KLB, and FGFR4 form a ternary and/or quaternary complex in a similar manner. As FGFR4 is the essential and indispensable receptor for mediating both FGF19\u2019s physiological function in regulating bile acid metabolism and its tumorigenic activity in driving the pathogenesis of HCC,43, 44, 45 it is therefore especially important to uncover the structure\u2010function relationships that govern FGF19\u2019s tumorigenic and bile\u2010acid\u2010regulatory activities.",

The unique features of our NT\u2010targeting Abs likely result from their selective interruption of the FGF19\u2010FGFR4 interactions that is required for tumorigenesis. Building on the aforementioned structural and functional findings, we surmised that the interaction of FGF19\u2019s CT with KLB plays the most critical role in tethering receptors and implementing all of FGF19\u2019s activities; whereas the globular NT interacts with FGFR4 and may modulate the receptor dimerization, hence regulates downstream receptor signaling strength. Thus, Abs (ie, 1A6) targeting a region proximal to FGF19\u2019s CT may lead to a complete loss of FGF19\u2019s activities, including its physiological activity. Antibodies (ie, G1A8 and HS29) targeting the FGF19\u2010NT may only reduce receptor signaling strength to a level that can still maintain FGF19\u2019s physiological activity in bile acid metabolism (Figure S6).",
