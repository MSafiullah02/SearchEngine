Humans are infected through the skin (cutaneous anthrax), by ingestion (gastrointestinal anthrax), or by inhalation of anthrax spores (inhalational anthrax) [1]. The last often results from prolonged exposure to animal hides or carcasses or infected soil, and rarely by deliberate spore exposure in the bioterrorism setting. After inhalation the spores are ingested by alveolar macrophages and transported to regional nodes, where the spores germinate and release potent exotoxins. These toxins damage cell membranes, increase capillary permeability, cause pulmonary damage, and lead to shock and cardiovascular collapse.",

Treatment with IVIG inhibits complement-induced inflammation by decreasing complement deposition on the endomysial capillaries of muscle tissues [163], [164].
