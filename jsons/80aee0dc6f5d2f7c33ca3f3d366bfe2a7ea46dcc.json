The world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in the population, because of this the incidence of a number of pathologies has been increasing and thus is producing an increase in the number of individuals with systemic medical conditions that can affect oral health and subsequent dental treatment. The dental management of medically compromised patients can be sometimes problematic in terms of oral complications, dental therapy, and emergency care.

A log of needlesticks, sharps injuries, and other employee exposure events should be maintained. 3.

Written policies and procedures should be available to ensure reusable patient care instruments, and devices are cleaned and reprocessed appropriately before use on another patient. 2. Clean and disinfect/sterilize reusable dental equipment appropriately before use on any other patient, according to the manufacturer's instructions. If the manufacturer does not provide such instructions, the device may not be suitable for multi-use. 3. Wear appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) when handling contaminated patient equipment (e.g., examination or heavy duty utility gloves, protective clothing, masks, eye protection) to prevent exposure to infectious agents or chemicals. 4.
