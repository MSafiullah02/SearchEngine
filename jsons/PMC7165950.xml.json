            "text": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, negative\u2010stranded RNA virus of the filovirus family. Infection of humans with EBOV causes Ebola haemorrhagic fever. At present, neither antivirals nor vaccines are available to combat this lethal disease, and EBOV is classified as a category A priority pathogen (NIAID, 2011). Four EBOV species have been defined (Kuhn, 2008), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), and a fifth species has been proposed, Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) (Towner et al., 2008). African fruit bats are a natural reservoir of the second filoviral genus, Marburg virus (MARV), and have also been proposed as a natural reservoir of EBOV (Leroy et al., 2005). African fruit bats may transmit the virus to humans either directly or via an intermediate host (Groseth et al., 2007). Outbreaks of ZEBOV, SEBOV, CIEBOV and BEBOV have been recorded in Africa and were associated with case\u2010fatality rates of up to 90% in larger outbreaks. REBOV has been detected in swine in the Philippines and is believed to be apathogenic for humans with an intact immune system (Barrette et al., 2009; Hartman et al., 2010). The determinants accounting for the differential pathogenicity of the different EBOV species are poorly understood.",

            "text": "Innate defences of the host are crucial to successfully fight EBOV and other acute infections. The interferon (IFN) system is an integral part of the innate immunity against viral infections. Sensor molecules of the IFN system recognize viral components and induce signalling that triggers expression of IFNs (Baum and Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre, 2011). Subsequent binding of IFN to IFN receptors on uninfected cells activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)\u2010dependent signalling, which commandeers the cell to express IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs), which can function as antiviral effectors molecules (Schindler et al., 2007; Sadler and Williams, 2008). Ebola virus strains lethal in humans were found to be unable to produce fatal disease in adult mice. However, when essential components of the IFN system were inactivated in mice, fatal disease was observed (Bray, 2001). Similarly, adaptation of EBOV to efficient replication in adult mice (Bray et al., 1998) resulted in the generation of viruses with mutations allowing efficient interference with components of the murine IFN system (Ebihara et al., 2006). Thus, the IFN system is generally capable of restricting filovirus spread and pathogenesis. However, several EBOV proteins are well adapted to block processes essential for the establishment of a vigorous IFN response in human cells, potentially explaining why the IFN system frequently fails to protect humans from lethal EBOV infection, as discussed below.",

However, the antiviral effector molecules induced by IFN and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antiviral action are incompletely understood. Recent, groundbreaking studies attempted to close this gap (Schoggins et al., 2011) and identified novel ISGs, among them the tetherin and IFN\u2010induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) (Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008; Brass et al., 2009). Tetherin exhibits an unusual topology and restricts release of several enveloped viruses and filovirus\u2010like particles from infected cells, while IFITM proteins inhibit infection by filoviruses and other enveloped viruses at the stage of viral entry, as discussed below. In the present review, we will summarize current knowledge on EBOV interference with the IFN system. In addition, we will discuss how tetherin and IFITMs block filovirus infection.",

            "text": "The interferon system constitutes a major innate defence against infections by viruses and other pathogens. The components and signalling pathways of the IFN system have been described in several recent reviews (Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre and Biron, 2006; Baum and Garc\u00eda\u2010Sastre, 2010; Liu et al., 2011) and are only briefly summarized here. Three classes of IFNs have been defined according to the receptors bound by these cytokines. Type I IFN, including IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, are produced by many cell types as a direct result of viral infection. IFN\u03b3, the only type II IFN, is generated by activated T cells and NK cells. Type III IFNs, which include IFN\u03bb1\u20133, are incompletely characterized, but are believed to regulate the antiviral response. The IFN system integrates two major sensor and signalling networks. In cells exposed to viruses, receptors for pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns sense the presence of the invading pathogens. These receptors are located in the cytoplasm, like retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) and melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA\u20105), or in the extracytoplasmic space, like Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20103 and TLR\u20107/8/9, and, upon pathogen recognition, induce IFN regulatory factor (IRF)\u20103\u2010 and IRF\u20107\u2010dependent signalling cascades that lead to the expression of type I IFNs (Fig. 2). Secreted type I IFNs then bind to cells expressing the type I IFN receptor, which consists of two subunits, IFN\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2. Ligand binding to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 triggers receptor dimerization and signalling. STAT1 and STAT2 are integral components of the signalling pathway induced by IFNARs (Fig. 2). Homodimers of STAT1 bind to IFN\u03b3\u2010activated sites (GAS), while STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers recognize IFN\u2010stimulated response elements, resulting in the transcription of ISGs, many of which have antiviral activity, like the well\u2010characterized myxovirus resistance guanosine triphosphatases (Mx GTPases) (Haller et al., 2007; Sadler and Williams, 2008). However, the full spectrum of ISGs has only been recently characterized (Schoggins et al., 2011), and novel ISGs that target discrete steps in the viral life cycle, like IFITMs and tetherin, have been identified, as discussed below.",

The dimerization leads to the exposition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in STAT1, which is recognized by the nuclear import adaptor protein importin \u03b1, specifically importin \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b17 (karyopherin \u03b11, \u03b15, \u03b16; NP\u20101 subfamily of importins). Importin \u03b1 is then bound by the nuclear import factor importin \u03b2 (Sekimoto et al., 1997), which facilitates import of STAT dimers into the nucleus (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of VP24, which like STAT1 binds to importins \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b17 (Reid et al., 2006, 2007), the recognition of the PY\u2010STAT1 NLS by these importins is disrupted, and PY\u2010STAT1 is not imported into the nucleus. Blockade of nuclear transport of PY\u2010STAT1 is not because of a global inhibition of nuclear import, as VP24 does not bind to importin \u03b11 (karyopherin \u03b12; RchI subfamily), \u03b13 or \u03b14 (karyopherin \u03b14, \u03b13; Qip1 subfamily) (Reid et al., 2007) and does not affect nuclear import mediated by these factors.",

Predictions on VP24 structure offer insights into the mechanisms potentially underlying VP24 inhibition of importin \u03b1. (Lee et al., 2009). Thus, it was suggested that VP24, like importin \u03b1, importin \u03b2 and exportins (nuclear export factors important for recycling of importin \u03b1 to the cytoplasm), belongs to the ARM family of proteins. Furthermore, it was posited that binding of VP24 to importin \u03b1 mimics that of exportin, which also targets ARM repeat 10 (Lee et al., 2009). As a consequence, VP24 may block release of the autoinhibitory NLS of importin \u03b1, and this would inhibit binding of other proteins to the NLS binding site of importin \u03b1, including PY\u2010STAT1. Alternatively, targeting the ARM10 repeat of importin \u03b1 by VP24 may block binding of PY\u2010STAT1 because of competitive inhibition (Lee et al., 2009). In VP24, the amino acid residues 42 and 142\u2013146 were found to be crucial for the inhibition of IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced signalling and PY\u2010STAT accumulation in the nucleus (Mateo et al., 2010). The lack of inhibition of IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced signalling by a VP24 mutant with amino acid exchanges at these positions correlated with absence of importin \u03b15 binding, highlighting that binding of VP24 to importin \u03b15 is essential for IFN antagonism (Mateo et al., 2010).",

Adaptation of ZEBOV to lethal infection of mice was associated with mutations in VP24 and NP (Ebihara et al., 2006). However, both wild\u2010type VP24 and VP24 of the mouse\u2010adapted (MA) strain were able to bind to human and mouse NP\u20101 importins and to disrupt the interaction with PY\u2010STAT1 (Reid et al., 2007). Similar findings were documented for VP24 of REBOV, which is believed to be non\u2010pathogenic for humans, and it was shown that ZEBOV, REBOV and MA VP24 can suppress IFN\u2010\u03b2\u2010induced gene expression (Reid et al., 2007). Thus, alterations in VP24 interference with the IFN response might not account for the acquisition of virulence of MA ZEBOV in mice and for the lack of virulence of REBOV in humans, respectively.",

(2000) who showed that VP35 can functionally replace the influenza A virus (FLUAV) non\u2010structural protein 1 (NS1) protein, a viral type I IFN antagonist. VP35 was found to inhibit the virus\u2010induced activation of type I IFN promoters by targeting the transcription factor IRF\u20103. In contrast, activation of IFN promoters through exogenous IFN was not modulated by VP35 (Basler et al., 2003). Upon activation by viral infection, IRF\u20103 is phosphorylated by cellular kinases such as TANK\u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK\u20101) and I\u03baB kinase epsilon (IKK\u03b5) (Prins et al., 2009). Subsequently, IFR\u20103 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus where it activates transcription of ISGs (Fig. 4). VP35 blocks IRF\u20103 phosphorylation and therefore subsequent nuclear accumulation of IRF\u20103 (Basler et al., 2003; C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006). For this, VP35 binds to IKK\u03b5 and TBK\u20101 and inhibits substrate binding and kinase activity (Prins et al., 2009).",

Several amino acid residues (R305, K309, R312, K319, R322) in the central basic patch of the C\u2010terminal IFN inhibitory domain (IID) of VP35 were shown to be required for inhibition of virus\u2010induced activation of IFN\u2010regulated promoters and production of IFN\u2010\u03b2 (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006; Prins et al., 2010b), with R312 being of particular importance (Hartman et al., 2004; C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006). Mutations in the IID attenuate viral growth in cell lines (Hartman et al., 2006) and the C\u2010terminal basic patch residues are highly conserved between filoviruses, highlighting their importance for the function of VP35 (Hartman et al., 2004; Prins et al., 2010b). Notably, the disruption of the IRF\u20103 inhibitory activity of VP35 does not influence the function of VP35 in viral replication and transcription (Hartman et al., 2006), as amino acid residues essential for polymerase cofactor function of VP35 differ from those required for IFN antagonism (Prins et al., 2010a).",

Indeed, VP35 is able to bind dsRNA, but not single\u2010stranded (ss) RNA or dsDNA and mutations in the central basic patch of IID, which abrogate IFN antagonism were found to be incompatible with dsRNA binding (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2010; Prins et al., 2010b). The structure of VP35 IID in complex with dsRNA has been determined at the atomic level (Kimberlin et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010), and the protein was found to display a unique fold compared with known dsRNA\u2010binding proteins, including that of FLUAV NS1 (Leung et al., 2009). Interestingly, VP35 displays a bimodal dsRNA\u2010binding strategy. Upon dsRNA recognition, VP35 builds asymmetric dimers; one monomer binds the dsRNA phosphate backbone, whereas the other binds terminal nucleotides of the dsRNA molecule (Kimberlin et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010). This dsRNA\u2010binding mode of VP35 dimers seems to mimic that of RIG\u2010I, a key cellular sensor of dsRNA, and VP35 and RIG\u2010I might occupy overlapping binding sites on dsRNA (Kimberlin et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010). These findings suggest that VP35 may sequester dsRNA from recognition by RIG\u2010I and potentially other dsRNA\u2010binding molecules such as MDA\u20105 or Dicer (Kimberlin et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010). In addition, differences in the structural organization and dsRNA binding of ZEBOV and REBOV VP35 were identified, which might contribute to the differential pathogenicity of these viruses in humans (Kimberlin et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010), although it needs to be noted that both viruses are highly pathogenic in macaques.",

Subsequently, it phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 \u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which results in the arrest of protein synthesis from cellular and viral mRNAs (Garc\u00eda et al., 2007). In the context of EBOV infection, it was noted that the expression of VP35 and eIF\u20102\u03b1 phosphorylation inversely correlate and that autophosphorylation of PKR is disrupted in the presence of VP35 (Feng et al., 2007). Thus, VP35 inhibits PKR activation (Fig. 5). In fact, ZEBOV was shown to not only block, but to reverse activation of PKR (Schumann et al., 2009). Feng et al. (2007) suggested that VP35 inhibition of PKR might not involve interactions of these proteins and might not depend on dsRNA binding by VP35. Instead, a role of the N\u2010terminal sequences in VP35 was suggested. Subsequent work by Schumann et al. (2009) indicates that mutations in the IID can be sufficient to relief the block to PKR activation imposed by VP35 and that PRK antagonism by VP35 is therefore functionally separate from dsRNA binding and IRF\u20103 inhibition.",

The observation that several viruses encode RNAi silencing suppressors (RSS), like the NS1 protein of FLUAV or the Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101), underlines the potency of this cellular defence mechanism (Bivalkar\u2010Mehla et al., 2011). Haasnoot et al. (2007) demonstrated that EBOV VP35 is an RSS, which inhibits shRNA\u2010mediated suppression of reporter gene expression and rescues production of tat\u2010defective HIV\u20101 from suppression by RNAi. The RSS activity of VP35 was dependent on its dsRNA\u2010binding capability (Haasnoot et al., 2007), suggesting that VP35 may sequester and protect dsRNA from recognition by dicer, a central molecule of the RNAi pathway (Fig. 4). However, a subsequent study demonstrated that VP35 interacts with components of the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC) independent of the presence of siRNA (Fabozzi et al., 2011). Specifically, VP35 was found to interact with the two dsRNA\u2010binding proteins HIV\u20101 trans\u2010activation response RNA\u2010binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of PKR (PACT), which are part of the RISC complex, but not directly with dicer (Fabozzi et al., 2011). In addition, evidence was presented that also VP30 and VP40 act as RSS, and VP30 like VP35 was shown to bind to components of the RISC complex, while no such interactions were seen for VP40, which might employ a different strategy to inhibit RNAi (Fabozzi et al., 2011).",

EBOV\u2010GP1,2 is synthesized as a precursor protein, which is post\u2010translationally cleaved by subtilisin\u2010like proteases into its two subunits GP1 and GP2 (Volchkov et al., 1998). The large and heavily glycosylated, extracellular domain GP1 mediates attachment to the host cell; the smaller TM unit GP2 facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of host cell endosomes (Takada et al., 1997; Wool\u2010Lewis and Bates, 1998). A recent study demonstrated that GP1,2 also inactivates one of the cell`s innate defences against infection, the tetherin protein (Kaletsky et al., 2009). Vpu allows HIV\u20101 to evade tetherin by mediating cell surface downregulation and relocalization of tetherin into intracellular compartments (Van Damme et al., 2008). In addition, Vpu facilitates degradation of tetherin in lysosomal or proteasomal compartments (Douglas et al., 2009; Goffinet et al., 2009, 2010; Mangeat et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2009; Dub\u00e9 et al., 2010). In contrast, no evidence for downregulation, relocalization away from the cell surface or degradation of tetherin was observed in the presence of EBOV\u2010GP1,2 or MARV\u2010GP1,2 (Kaletsky et al., 2009; Lopez et al., 2010; Radoshitzky et al., 2010; K\u00fchl et al., 2011a). Furthermore, EBOV\u2010GP1,2 is active against tetherin homologues from different monkeys, in accordance with the ability of EBOV to infect several non\u2010human primates (K\u00fchl et al., 2011a). In contrast, tetherin antagonism by Vpu is limited to tetherin of human, chimpanzee and gorilla origin, and these species are infected by HIV\u20101 and Vpu encoding SIV, respectively (Goffinet et al., 2009; Jia et al., 2009; McNatt et al., 2009). Thus, Vpu and EBOV\u2010GP1,2 have a different specificity for tetherin and employ different strategies to counteract tetherin.",

(ii) A soluble \u0394\u2010peptide is released upon proteolytic processing of sGP by furin (Volchkova et al., 1999). (iii) The full\u2010length, membrane\u2010bound form GP1,2, which is incorporated into the virions, is produced by RNA editing of the primary transcript (Volchkov et al., 1995; Sanchez et al., 1996). (iv) Furthermore, a small soluble GP (ssGP) has recently been identified, but the function of this protein is at present unknown (Mehedi et al., 2011). In addition, the TNF\u2010\u03b1 converting enzyme induces shedding of GP1,2\u0394 from the surface of infected cells by cleaving GP1,2 near the TM domain (Dolnik et al., 2004). All different forms of the GP might play a role in combating the host\u2019s immune system as, for example the shedded form of GP might be able to act as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies (Dolnik et al., 2008). However, neither sGP nor GP1,2\u0394 are able to counteract tetherin (Kaletsky et al., 2009). In addition, a GP1,2 mutant that is retained in the ER failed to counteract tetherin, suggesting that the correct localization of the EBOV\u2010GP1,2 at sites of viral budding is crucial for tetherin antagonism (Kaletsky et al., 2009). Indeed, because of the expression of the GPI\u2010anchor, tetherin is localized to lipid rafts, which are used by HIV\u20101 and EBOV as platforms for budding (Ono and Freed, 2001; Bavari et al., 2002).",

Inhibition of filoviruses and SARS\u2010CoV was demonstrated employing lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the respective viral GPs and with replication competent virus (Huang et al., 2011), but the inhibitory efficiency was modest. In contrast to FLUAV, IFITM1 showed the most prominent antiviral effects against replication competent EBOV and MARV, while inhibition by IFITM3 was less efficient (Huang et al., 2011). Entry of MARV and EBOV was reduced by the expression of several IFITM orthologues of mouse and chicken, although with different efficacies compared to the human proteins (Huang et al., 2011). Depletion of IFITM3 by shRNA was sufficient to rescue entry of FLUAV pseudotypes, whereas a knockdown of both, IFITM1 and IFITM3, was required to increase entry of EBOV and MARV pseudotypes (Huang et al., 2011). Finally, a different study also detected inhibition of HIV\u20101 infection (Lu et al., 2011), which does not depend on low pH, and it is at present unclear which structure or process shared by the viruses listed above for host cell entry is targeted by IFITMs.",

Abrogation of S\u2010palmitoylation of IFITM3 by mutation of crucial cysteine residues inhibited IFITM3 clustering in membrane compartments as well as the antiviral activity of IFITM3 against FLUAV (Yount et al., 2010). The sites of S\u2010palmitoylation are highly conserved in members of the IFITM protein family, suggesting a general role in the antiviral activity. In addition, the sequence of the N\u2010terminus is distinct for the different IFITMs as IFITM1 is lacking an N\u2010terminal amino acid stretch present in IFITM2 and 3. Part of the N\u2010terminus might be crucial for their different antiviral activity (Siegrist et al., 2011). Indeed, the characterization of IFITM1/IFITM3 chimeras revealed that sequences within the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminus of IFITM3 are important for antiviral activity against VSIV (Weidner et al., 2010). Furthermore, Lu et al. (2011) could show that only IFITM\u20102 and IFITM\u20103 inhibit the HIV\u20101 life cycle at the step of viral entry, and that deletion of the N\u2010terminal region abrogated this ability.

            "text": "What is known about the mechanism underlying IFITM dependent inhibition of host cell entry of EBOV and other viruses? One possibility is that IFITMs interfere with receptor expression. However, IFITM proteins do not interfere with the level of surface expression of sialic acids and ACE2, the receptors for FLUAV and SARS\u2010CoV, respectively (Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011). IFITM expression is compatible with FLUAV access to low pH compartments, and inhibition of SARS\u2010CoV by IFITMs could be rescued by forcing the virus to fuse with the plasma membrane instead of an internal membrane (Huang et al., 2011). Thus, viruses might reach internal compartments in IFITM expressing cells in which fusion of viral and compartment membrane could normally occur, but membrane fusion might be blocked by IFITMs. One possibility could be that IFITMs interfere with the activity of cathepsins, pH\u2010dependent endo\u2010/lysosomal proteases essential for proteolytic activation of SARS\u2010CoV and filoviruses in vitro (Chandran et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2005). No appreciable decrease of cathepsin activity was observed in IFITM expressing cells (Huang et al., 2011). The endosomal membrane protein NPC1 has recently been reported as an essential host cell factor for EBOV entry (Carette et al., 2011; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011). According to the model of C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., NPC1 expression or activity is required for endosomal fusion after cathepsin\u2010mediated processing of GP1,2. It is conceivable that IFITMs interfere with NPC1 expression or activity. Furthermore, it is possible that a step in the filovirus life cycle different from membrane fusion could be affected by IFITMs, as it was reported that IFITM2 and 3 inhibit HIV\u20101 entry, whereas IFITM1 acts later in the viral life cycle by suppressing Gag translation (Lu et al., 2011). Thus, the mechanisms underlying inhibition of filoviruses and other viruses remain to be defined, including the possibility that IFITMs require cellular cofactors to exert their antiviral effects.",

VP24 and VP35 play key roles in suppressing the IFN response by preventing nuclear translocation of STAT1 and by targeting IRF\u20103 and IRF\u20107, respectively. Tetherin and IFITM proteins are novel ISGs, which could suppress EBOV infectious entry into target cells (IFITMs) and release of EBOV particles from infected cells (tetherin). Efficient suppression of EBOV release has so far only been demonstrated with VLPs and remains to be shown with infectious EBOV. For this, the sequences in GP1,2, which facilitate tetherin antagonism, need to be identified and altered, which should render EBOV susceptible to inhibition by tetherin. The GP2 subunit is an excellent candidate for these endeavours (K\u00fchl et al., 2011a). The mechanism underlying EBOV inhibition by IFITMs is at present unknown, and its elucidation might require the identification of potential interaction partners of GP1,2 and IFITMs in host cell endosomes. In addition, it will be interesting to determine to which extent basal (in the absence of IFN) expression of IFITMs and tetherin impact EBOV spread. A recent study demonstrated that basal tetherin expression is broader than initially appreciated and raised doubts concerning the sole regulation of tetherin expression by IFNs (Erikson et al., 2011). Moreover, the role of the IFN system in the EBOV infection of the potential reservoir host, fruit bats (Leroy et al., 2005), is of high interest. Thus, EBOV infection of these animals does not seem to induce disease (Swanepoel et al., 1996; Hayman et al., 2010), and it is tempting to speculate that the bat IFN system efficiently controls viral replication. Finally, the interesting insights into EBOV interference with the IFN system open new avenues to the development of filovirus inhibitors. Proof of concept comes from studies with HIV\u20101, which demonstrated that stabilization of antiviral effectors molecules of the IFN system or inhibition of viral IFN antagonists by small molecules can suppress viral spread (Cen et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Figure 5:  Countermeasures of Ebola virus against IFN\u2010induced antiviral proteins. Ebola virus infection commences with viral uptake and transport of virions into endosomal compartments, where the EBOV\u2010GP is activated by cathepsins. Subsequently, GP mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, allowing release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Subsequently, the viral genome is transcribed into mRNAs and replicated. Viral proteins are translated and transported to the cellular membrane for assembly of new particles, which eventually bud from the host cell membrane. Virus entry is inhibited by the IFN\u2010induced IFITM proteins. The exact step that is blocked by IFITMs remains to be defined. The protein kinase R, which senses dsRNA intermediates of viral replication, phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, which results in the arrest of translation of viral and cellular mRNAs. The tetherin protein tethers budding EBOV\u2010like particles to the cell surface and is counteracted by EBOV\u2010GP.
