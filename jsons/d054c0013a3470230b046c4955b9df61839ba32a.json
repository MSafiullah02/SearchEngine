Electroantennograms (EAG) were recorded on male moths in response to thirty compounds and the response profiles of each species were analysed by factorial correspondence analysis. A limited number of molecules were found active and the most effective stimuli were Z9 tetradecenes and Z l l hexadecenes. The species of the Mythirnnu genus were most sensitive to aldehydes. Tholeru decimulis did not respond to any of the molecules tested. The species belonging to the Murnestru and the Orthosia genera responded to a variety of molecules and no simple correlation was found between the genus and the EAG sensibility. Pheromone reception is discussed in relation to the taxonomy and the evolution of olfactory communication in Hadeninae.",

Global antenna1 responses to pheromone components (electroantennograms or EAGs; Schneider, 1962) have been extensively recorded. Commonly, EAG screenings of series of synthetic analogs or isomers are performed to draw the response profile of a moth species. Peaks of activity on the EAG response profile reveal the most active molecules, among which a key compound corresponds with the major constituent of the pheromone secretion. Thus, EAG technique has been extensively used for both characterization and identification of the sex pheromone components of moths .",

Although biochemical and behavioural studies are needed to determine the composition of the multicomponent pheromone blends, all the behaviourally relevant compounds are necessarily detected through sensory neurones and a good knowledge of the peripheral olfactory system is essential. A description of the differences and the similarities in the responses of the olfactory receptors of related moth species to a common set of pheromone compounds might provide information on many important aspects of pheromone communication in a taxonomic group: the chemical nature of detected pheromone compounds and their specificity, the sensory equipment and sensory coding in relation to pheromone blends, the evolutionary trends in the pheromone reception system. EAG recording procedures might be standardized and comparative studies are facilitated by multivariate methods in analysis of responseprofiles .",

Hadeninae are trifine noctuid moths characterized by their hairy eyes and the absence of spines on their tibia. They are active at night and polyphagous in general, but some of them can be more specialized. Larvae eat the aerial part of plants. Generally plurivoltines, they overwinter as pupae or larvae. Several species damage crops and integrated programmes including sex attractant trapping have been developed to control their populations. A better knowledge of pheromone signal processing by the olfactory system is needed to improve effectiveness and specificity of synthetic pheromone blends.",

Z9-14:Ac has been identified as the major component of the pheromone of M.biren (FrCrot et al., 1988) and it acts as an attractant for males of several Hadeninae species (Am et al., 1986) . Furthermore, Z9-14:Ac reduces the attraction of male M.brassicae (Struble et al., 1980) and M.suasa to synthetic pheromone blend sources. High EAG sensitivity to molecules not present in the female secretion is not limited to moths of the Hadeninae subfamily but might be a general phenomenon. Specific receptor cells for Z7-12:OH, a male behaviour inhibitor, have been found in a Plusiinae, Trichoplusia ni Hubner (O'Connell et al., 1983) . Disparlure is the sex attractant of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., and of the nun moth, Lymantria monacha L., which occur sympatrically in Europe. Sensilla trichodea of the gypsy moth house a receptor cell for (+)disparlure and a receptor cell for (-)disparlure (Hansen, 1984) . Pheromone gland extracts from female gypsy moths stimulate only the (+)disparlure cells while both cells are stimulated by the pheromone extracts from the nun moth. Female gypsy moths produce only (+)disparlure but female nun moths emit also (-)disparlure that does not modify the responses of male nun moths but that inhibits attraction to (+)disparlure of male gypsy moths under field conditions. In Hadeninae, as in other Lepidoptera, the presence of specific olfactory neurones enables male moths to detect heterospecific females and to distinguish them from their conspecific females.

Although the major component can be attractive to the male by itself, the complete behavioural sequence or the full competitiveness with females are rarely seen with single component stimuli. Furthermore, minor components contribute to the specificity of the pheromone blend. EAG response profiles are dominated by the strong responses to the key compound which is usually the major component of the female secretion. Close analogues of EAG-active compounds may produce strong antenna1 responses that could be misinterpreted in the absence of behavioural data. However, this does not affect the result of a comparative study as differences in the responses to analogues directly reflect differences of the nature andlor the abundance of receptor cell types and thus give information on the olfactory system under study. Minor components often elicit much weaker EAG responses that can be easily underestimated.

The necessity for sympatric species to avoid competition for communication channels and to reinforce their reproductive isolation may result in the evolution of different pheromone reception systems in closely related species. Variations of sensitivity inside a genus are useful for species characterization as illustrated in Mythimna, a very homogeneous genus with regard to the appearance and the biology of its members despite its subdivision in subgenera. Besides their common sensitivity to aldehydes, there were many more differences in the EAG response profiles between close species of the A limited number of molecules were found to be EAG-active in the investigated sample of Hadeninae species.

Furthermore, the EAG-active molecules presented an unity of chemical structure, and their biosynthesis probably involves only a few biosynthetic elementary steps, mainly a succession of desaturations and chain shortenings (Roelofs & Bjostad, 1984) . They were linear alkyl chains of fourteen or sixteen carbon atoms. Shorter chain lengths (C10 or C12) were less active. All the active molecules were monoenes of Z stereochemistry. The two saturated compounds were not effective stimuli. Although they were produced in significant amounts by the females in many species of Noctuidae, they are often not active in field trapping experiments. However, dodecyl acetate has been proven to modulate the close range search behaviour of male Trichoplusia ni (L.) (Bjostad et al., 1980) and to increase the responses of the two types of receptor cells when added to their respective key compounds, Z7-12:Ac and Z7-12:OH (O'Connell, 1985) . Thus, the contribution of saturated compounds to pheromone communication might be very variable from one species to another. Double bond positions were commonly located on carbon 9 in the C14 and on carbon 11 in the C16. Although an exception could be found in M.persicariae, double bond position and stereochemistry appeared to be stable traits of active molecules. Acetates and aldehydes were the most commonly active molecules. Alcohols were rarely effective stimuli, excepted in 0.munda. Similar conclusions have been drawn from an analysis of the list of known sex attractants and pheromone components of Hadeninae of the world wide fauna (Renou et al., 1986) . Hexadeceynl and tetradecenyl acetates are the most common attractants for male Hadeninae as for the majority of the trifine subfamilies of the Noctuidae. Sex attractants with shorter chains (decenyl and dodecynl acetates) are rare in the Hadeninae, unlike in the Noctuinae and in a quadrifine subfamily, the Plusiinae. Tetradecenals and hexadecenals are EAG-effective compounds in new world species of Leucania Ochsenheimer and Pseudaletia Franclemont, two genera closely related to the Mythimna (Renou et al., 1986) . Aldehyde attractants are common only in Hadeninae and Heliothinae.",

            "text": "The Hadenine genera were originally separated in several subfamilies by early authors. However, Hampson (1905) brought them all together into a single trifine subfamily defined by hairy eyes and unspined tibiae. Franclemont & Todd (1983) further recognized three tribes. The Glottulini comprised only Xanthopastis Hiibner, a genus regarded as being not closely related to the other Hadeninae (Kitching, 1984) . The Eriopygini included the genera Orthodes GuenBe, Tricholita Grote and others. The Hadenini contained the remaining genera, including all the species we investigated in this paper. High E A G responses t o Z11-16:Ald were recorded in an Eriopyga from Guadeloupe (Renou, unpublished data) but data on sex pheromone chemistry in Eriopygini are lacking. The EAG key compound of the neotropical species Xanthopastis timais Cramer is Z1 1 -16: Ald (Renou et al., 1986) and this aldehyde has been found in the female pheromone secretion (Lalanne-Cassou, unpublished data). Thus, sensitivity to aldehydes could have evolved independently in several lineages of Hadeninae. Catocalinae and some other quadrifines respond to polyenic hydrocarbons and to their epoxydes (Renou et a l . , 1988) . The position of Tholera decimalis, whose antenna1 sensitivity is, t o our knowledge, unique in Hadeninae but is common in Catocalinae and Geometridae, should be reinvestigated. Its sensitivity to alcene pheromones might indicate that the Tholera genus is at an early point in the Hadeninae line of evolution or that it is an isolated lineage having undergone parallel evolution with the Catocalinae. Single trichoid sensilla recordings are needed to determine the cell receptor types present on the antenna. Such recordings, coupled with detailed behavioural data on the role of pheromone compounds, will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of pheromone reception in moths.",

Pairs of closely related species (M. impura and M.pallens, or M. ferrago and M . albipuncta) occupied remote positions on the factorial map and had different key compounds. Conversely, two distant species such as M.albipuncta and M.pallens were close to each other on the map as they showed more similar EAG profiles and shared the same key compounds. M.obsoleta, the only species of the Leucania Ochsenheimer subgenus tested, was removed from the Mythimna of the Mythimna subgenus by the FCA. Z11-16:Ald was the key compound of M.obsoZeta as it was for some species of the Mythimna Ochsenheimer subgenus, but there could be a convergence of the pheromone structure in the two sub-genera.",
