            "text": "Our lives are shaped by constant encounters with an extraordinarily diverse and staggering number of microorganisms in our environment. Most of these microorganisms pose little threat to vertebrates such as ourselves, and many enrich our lives tremendously, either directly (e.g. commensal gut microbiota) or indirectly (e.g. nitrogen fixation, cheese, beer). However, some microbes have evolved to prey upon vertebrate hosts, either by feeding on us or hijacking our cells to generate countless copies of themselves. In the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen, vertebrates have evolved potent front line innate immune defenses that recognize conserved pathogen associated patterns as well as host\u2010derived \u2018danger\u2019 signals 1. These innate immune mechanisms rely on germline\u2010encoded receptors to recognize highly conserved and \u2018unchangeable\u2019 structural components that pathogens cannot easily mutate 2, 3, 4. Vertebrates have also evolved complementary adaptive immune mechanisms that are highly specific and establish immune memory such that future challenges of the same type will be abortive or blunted. Through an elegant series of stepwise DNA rearrangements, adaptive lymphocytes generate tremendous antigen receptor diversity using a limited number of germline\u2010encoded antigen receptor genes, resulting in clonally diverse populations with wide\u2010ranging specificities 5, 6, 7. The two classical adaptive immune cell types are B and T lymphocytes. B cells represent the humoral adaptive immune effector arm, secreting soluble antibody proteins directed against intact antigens to bind and neutralize pathogens 8. However, intracellular pathogens are often sequestered from antibody binding, and therefore must be eliminated using different strategies. T lymphocytes discriminate between host and pathogen via protein antigen fragments (peptides) presented in the context of cell surface\u2010expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules 9, 10, 11, 12. T\u2010cell antigen recognition is typified by T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) binding to MHC\u2010bound cognate peptide, and CD8 or CD4 coreceptor interaction with MHC class I and II, respectively. TCR and peptide\u2010MHC (pMHC) engagement results in a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately govern T\u2010cell fate and function. It is these interactions that usually determine whether antiviral T\u2010cell effector activity is pathogenic or non\u2010pathogenic.",

These interactions were dependent on TCR recognition of cognate pMHC and resulted in a highly polarized surface of engagement. The junctional interface between an antigen\u2010sensing T cell and APC is classically referred to as an immunological synapse. As the focal point for TCR signaling, this immunological synapse is thought to be an essential communication port. pMHC serves to nucleate synapse formation and establish an avenue for vectorial information to flow into T cells. Following pMHC engagement, an abundance of accessory and costimulatory molecules in and around the developing synapse allow APCs to ultimately authorize expansion, arming, and execution of T\u2010cell effector functions. The priming and regulation of T\u2010cell function is also heavily influenced by factors within the extracellular milieu; however, T\u2010cell function is by necessity predicated on TCR signaling.",

In 1998, Monks and Kupfer 16 provided seminal three\u2010dimensional (3D) evidence for specific interaction domains on the T\u2010cell surface during pMHC encounter. They showed that the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) is surrounded by a peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) to form an archetypal \u2018bulls\u2010eye\u2019 pattern that represents the mature immunological synapse structure 16. Classically, the cSMAC is rich in clustering TCRs cross\u2010junctionally engaging pMHC, whereas the pSMAC contains adhesion molecules such as leukocyte function\u2010associated antigen\u20101 (LFA\u20101) that physically stabilizes long\u2010term cell\u2013cell interactions. Several additional cSMAC constituents have been identified, including CD2, CD4, CD8, CD28, PKC\u2010\u03b8, Lck, and Fyn (reviewed in 17, 18). The formation of the immune synapse was classically believed to be critical for directional and specific intercellular communication, such as CD40\u2013CD40L interactions and delivery of effector molecules (e.g. lytic granule and cytokines) 19, 20, 21. Although the term immunological synapse was initially meant to describe a specific, highly dense region of TCR clustering with a peripheral adhesive ring, we now use the term more loosely to imply the contact interface through which cell\u2013cell communication occurs between T cells and their cognate pMHC\u2010bearing targets.",

This initial interaction phase was followed by the dynamic accumulation of pMHC\u2010engaged TCR within a central cluster surrounded by a ring of bound ICAM\u20101. A broad range of TCR\u2013pMHC affinities led to TCR clustering and Ca2+ signaling, indicating that cSMAC formation is a conserved feature of TCRs with different affinities. Lee et al. 23 provided similar evidence for cSMAC formation using a cell\u2013cell instead of planar bilayer system; however, this group also noted that TCR signaling occurred at the periphery of the immunological synapse and actually preceded cSMAC formation, raising questions about the importance of mature synapse formation in T\u2010cell activation.",

In particular, the directional secretion of effector molecules relies on polarization of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) to the immunological synapse 14. Interestingly, effector molecules are shuttled along the microtubule network toward the TCR\u2013pMHC\u2010driven synapse 13, 27. Many proteins are linked to MTOC polarization and the targeted release of effector molecules (reviewed in 28).",

This is partially a technical challenge in resolving protein microdomains within fixed or living tissues, but could also reflect the physiological infrequency of SMAC formation. By studying antiviral CD8+ T cells in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)\u2010infected brain, we demonstrated in vivo that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) polarize signaling (TCR, Lck), adhesion (LFA\u20101), and effector (perforin) molecules toward the contact surface with virally infected target cells 29 (Fig. \n1). In some instances, CTLs were able to form synapses with up to three separate targets simultaneously (Fig. \n1\nD). Because these studies were performed on static tissue sections, we were unable to observe the temporal relationship between CTL\u2010APC contact and the migratory behavior prior to arrest and polarization. Importantly, Barcia et al. 30 expanded upon our work by capturing 3D in vivo evidence of cSMAC and pSMAC formation along the contact interface of T cells and virally infected astrocytes in the brain. The formation of SMACs was specific to T cells engaging infected astrocytes and preceded T\u2010cell\u2010mediated clearance of these cells. Although these findings provide clear evidence that SMAC formation occurs in vivo, it remains unclear whether cSMAC generation is a functional necessity for cytolytic or helper T cells. In fact, Yang et al. recently concluded that mature immunological synapses did not appear to correlate with CTL\u2010mediated clearance of brain tumors 31, suggesting that SMAC formation is not a requirement for delivery of CTL effector functions.",

However, it is still debated whether long\u2010lived T\u2010cell\u2013APC interactions are required for priming and effector functions. Gunzer et al. 33 provided the first counterpoint to the stable immunological synapse paradigm by modeling in vivo tissue migration using a collagen matrix culture containing T cells and APCs. In this study, it was observed that T cells engaged in dynamic, short\u2010lived interactions with cognate pMHC\u2010bearing APCs instead of halting their migration and forming stable immune synapses 33. This observation led to the development of a serial encounter model in which a rapidly formed stable immunological synapse is not required after initial antigen encounter. Instead, a multitude of short\u2010lived serial TCR\u2013pMHC interactions occur, additively generating a cumulative activation signal 34. There is substantial evidence supporting the physiological relevance of serial antigen encounters during in vivo T\u2010cell priming 35, 36, 37. There are also data showing that TCR\u2013pMHC interactions can induce release of effector molecules in the absence of stable immunological synapse formation 38, 39, 40. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) imprinted transient TCR signals and remained active for TCR tolerance genes; however, more sustained TCR signaling was required for interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) expression 41. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for why transient TCR signaling induces tolerance in naive T cells. Thus, it appears that prolonged TCR signaling, whether achieved serially or continuously, is required for T\u2010cell priming and effector differentiation 42. Although serial TCR\u2013pMHC encounters can eventually generate a cumulative stop signal resulting in T\u2010cell arrest 36, 37, it remains unclear if the tight interactions observed after several hours of transient serial interactions are characterized by classic immunological synapse formation.",

Increasing the frequency of TCR engagements in vivo markedly enhances cell\u2013cell conjugate formation and migratory arrest, indicating a strong role for antigen dose in promoting rapid motility arrest 37. However, T cells operating in vivo often encounter priming and effector phase conditions in which cognate antigen is presented at a low level. This can occur when an APC is not infected or is simply presenting low levels of exogenously acquired antigen. In contrast, when T cells encounter infected target cells filled with antigen and densely covered in pMHC, the resultant engagement and TCR signaling may be strong enough to favor formation of a stable, mature immunological synapse. Recently, Moreau et al. 44 reported clear associations among TCR affinity, signal strength, and the formation of stable immunological synapses. Stable synapses were associated with the strongest TCR\u2013pMHC interactions, whereas dynamic interactions (referred to as kinapses) 45, 46 were observed in vivo with ligands of weak\u2010to\u2010moderate affinity. Importantly, kinapse interactions did result in T\u2010cell activation and proliferation, albeit with a delay proportional to the pMHC signaling strength 44.",

These interactions have been termed \u2018kinapses\u2019 to reflect the importance of movement (or kinesis) 45, 46. A kinapse represents a region of cell\u2013cell contact that serves to communicate information between the cells, but remains motile during signaling. Migrating T cells in vitro display motile synapses of TCR microclusters that move directionally along with the T cell, independent of cSMAC formation 51. Utilizing a transgenic mouse with green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2010tagged TCR, Friedman and colleagues 49 observed dynamic TCR trafficking in vitro and in vivo during naive T\u2010cell priming. In these studies, the authors found little evidence of extended TCR clustering or classic cSMAC generation upon antigen encounter. Moreover, upon antigen encounter, TCR internalization (which is evidence of TCR\u2013pMHC signaling) also occurred rapidly without generation of cSMAC structure. Even more importantly, T cells were shown to cluster TCRs, flux calcium, and then internalize their TCR clusters all while maintaining motile surveillance of pMHC\u2010presenting dendritic cells (DCs) 49. Similarly, Azar and colleagues, using a fluorescently tagged linker for activation of T\u2010cells (LAT) protein, found little evidence for distinct areas of large scale TCR signaling clusters along the T\u2010cell\u2013DC contact zone in vivo\n52. These authors also reported that activated effector T cells more frequently engage in kinapse\u2010like interactions with APC when compared with naive T cells. These data indicate that T\u2010cell activation state (naive, effector, memory) influences the type of cell\u2013cell contact zone (e.g. mature synapse versus kinapse) that is formed 52. The formation of motile versus fixed synapses may also be linked to the APC itself, as interactions between T and B cells were shown to facilitate classical fixed synapse formation, where T\u2010cell\u2013DC interactions were more brief and serial 53. Collectively, the aforementioned studies provide a framework for the relationship between TCR signaling and the T\u2010cell\u2013APC interface. Strong, high affinity TCR\u2013pMHC interactions are usually indicative of a T cell that has encountered a foreign peptide, which immediately authorizes the cell to activate. Following weaker TCR\u2013pMHC interactions, T cells use serial engagements and record cumulative signaling events to gather more evidence before crossing over a threshold and committing to activation. This helps to ensure that the serially engaged peptide warrants T\u2010cell activation.",

Neutralizing antibodies are also critical to clearance of many viral infections; however, their very nature as extracellular soluble effector molecules often precludes their ability to clear intracellular viral reservoirs.

LCMV virus is the prototypic model for T\u2010cell\u2010mediated viral clearance 55.

T\u2010cell entry into the CNS relies on selectins, chemokines, and integrins (reviewed in 70). LCMV infection is associated with massive type I IFN (IFN\u2010I) release 71, which plays an essential role in antiviral defense through induction of a myriad of antiviral proteins 72, 73 and by promoting adaptive immunity 74, 75. Our laboratory has shown that IFN\u2010I also leads to widespread increases in MHC I throughout the brain following LCMV infection, and this can be maintained indefinitely during states of persistent infection 76. Within the brains of mice persistently infected with LCMV, elevated MHC I expression was detected on endothelial cells and microglia. Endothelial cells have been reported to present antigen directly to T cells 77, and in one model, enhanced MHC I expression by CNS vascular endothelial cells facilitated the antigen\u2010specific entry of CD8+ T cells 78. It is known that TCR signaling events can link integrin and chemokine signaling to cytoskeletal changes required for motility 79, 80. Indeed, TCR signals can synergize with signals mediated by \u03b21 integrin 81, which is the very late antigen\u20104 complex that helps T cells gain access to the CNS. Thus, it is conceivable that pMHC\u2010dependent immunological synapse or kinapse formation with vascular endothelial cells may sensitize T cells to transmigrate, thereby increasing the homing specificity. However, it is important to note that bystander T cells of an irrelevant TCR specificity are known to traffic into sites of infection, including the brain 82, 83. Therefore, the general role of TCR\u2013pMHC interactions in the preferential recruitment of T cells to sites of infection remains unclear.

Up to 30% of CTLs were in active stages of cell cycle in the virus\u2010infected meninges. This dynamic observation of virus\u2010specific CTLs undergoing mitosis in the LCMV\u2010infected meninges has expanded our general understanding of T\u2010cell division programming. The traditional view of T\u2010cell proliferation is that the proliferative burst, which occurs within lymphoid organs during priming is a hardwired program 93 instituted by DCs 35. Contrary to this paradigm, we found that during LCMV meningitis, up to one third of antiviral CTLs depart lymphoid tissues and migrate through the blood while still in cell cycle 48. Peripherally cycling cells showed no overt differences in surface molecule expression or effector program from non\u2010cycling cells in circulation or the CNS. These cycling cells likely represent a stochastic vestige of the proliferative program initiated in secondary lymphoid tissues during CD8+ T\u2010cell priming. Using TPM, we observed that the number of motile CTLs in the LCMV\u2010infected meninges far outnumbered those that were stably arrested. We postulate that migrating CTLs integrate pMHC signals obtained from multiple infected target cells, which is consistent with the concept of serial signal integration. In the meninges, migrating CTLs often arrested briefly (approximately 10\u201315 min) to undergo mitosis before resuming their migration 48. Interaction with cognate pMHC was critical to advancing the CTL division program, but costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 were dispensable. These data extend upon the serial encounter model of cumulative TCR\u2013pMHC signal integration in lymphoid tissues to include the summation of signals accumulated systemically. In other words, antiviral T cells likely have the capacity to record and integrate signals obtained from multiple tissues. Another advantage of advancing the T\u2010cell division program serially is that antiviral T\u2010cell numbers can be modulated locally at sites of viral infection. Based on the signals delivered, T\u2010cell numbers can be easily increased to promote viral clearance or decreased to prevent immunopathology. Serial programming is more amenable to local control.",

At day 5 post\u2010infection, CTLs begin to survey the meninges, but the BBB remains intact and mice are asymptomatic 47. However, at 6 day post\u2010infection, CTL influx increases markedly and this coincides with a massive secondary recruitment of innate myelomonocytic cells (i.e. monocytes and neutrophils) that burst forth from meningeal vasculature, leading to vascular breakdown and seizure onset 47. This tidal wave of myelomonocytic recruitment into the CNS was precipitated in part by TCR\u2013pMHC interactions driving meningeal CTL to release chemokines such as CCL3, 4, and 5. From a survival perspective, we postulate that direct chemokine release by CTLs is critical to the development of rapid onset fatal convulsive seizures. This does not, however, negate the importance of cell death induced by classical CTL effector pathways like lytic granule secretion onto virally infected target cells, which does occur in this model 29. Depletion of myelomonocytic cells eliminates rapid onset seizures (on day 6) and extends survival, but mice eventually succumb to a disease that is likely mediated by CTLs. Additional studies are required to prove this definitively. In general, these data revised our understanding of how antiviral T cells contribute to immunopathological diseases.

Synaptically targeted delivery allows for strict communication between two \u2018authorized\u2019 partners, which spares the surrounding uninfected tissue from pathology and maintains the fundamental principles of antigen specificity within the adaptive immune system. However, although polarized delivery of lytic granules makes intuitive sense, and directional cytokine delivery by CD4+ T cells during humoral T\u2013B\u2010cell interactions must be antigen specific, there are situations in which directional delivery simply cannot accomplish certain goals. In the case of CD4+ T cells, relying solely on directional cytokine delivery precludes their ability to help cells that lack MHC II expression. As MHC II expression is far more restricted than MHC I, many cell types that could benefit from cytokine exposure would not be able to receive directional cytokine support. Importantly, Huse et al. 101 have shown that while some T\u2010cell\u2010derived cytokines (e.g. IFN\u03b3, IL\u20102) are targeted to pMHC\u2010expressing cells by an immunological synapse, others such as TNF and IL\u20104 are secreted multidirectionally (i.e. not only at the cell\u2013cell interface). Moreover, the chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 also appear to be multidirectionally secreted 101. Whether this is the case for chemokine production by antiviral CD8+ T cells remains unclear, but it seems reasonable to assume that meningeal TCR\u2013pMHC interactions drive CTLs to produce a cloud of chemokines within the LCMV\u2010infected meninges 47. In fact, even directional synapses have been shown to be \u2018leaky\u2019. Barcia and colleagues 102 recently demonstrated that CD8+ T cells within the virally infected CNS use directional (cSMAC\u2010containing) immunological synapses to release IFN\u03b3 and lytic granules toward targets; however, cell contacts lacking cSMAC structure (referred to as non\u2010Kupfer interactions) were also shown to result in IFN\u03b3 secretion. These non\u2010Kupfer interactions are still directional because they are regulated by TCR engagement. Using a clever in vitro technique to probe the true directionality of IFN\u03b3 release by CD8+ T cells, this same group showed that while antigen\u2010bearing target cells were directly exposed to IFN\u03b3 (evidenced by Stat1 relocalization), so were their non\u2010antigen\u2010bearing, unengaged neighbors 103. This observation implies that following formation of a TCR\u2013pMHC\u2010dependent contact interface, IFN\u03b3 can at least partially leak out into the surrounding extracellular area. This may be particularly relevant in immunoprivileged tissues where MHC I (and II) are not widely expressed. Within the virally infected CNS, many cells (especially neurons) express little to no MHC I 104, 105, making it difficult for T cells to directly engage them, even if they are infected. If nearby cells, such as microglia or DCs, present antigen to CD8+ T cells, IFN\u03b3 production can exert antiviral effects regionally as opposed to only on the pMHC\u2010bearing target cells.",

Immature APCs, with low costimulatory molecule expression, can nevertheless present pMHC complexes to T cells. TCR\u2013pMHC interactions on the surface of immature or tolerogenic DCs can result in T\u2010cell tolerance induction. T\u2010cell interactions with these immature DCs were shown to be shorter and less productive than those with mature APCs 108. Although these shorter interactions were deemed independent of CD80/86 influence, they nevertheless support an orchestrating role for APCs during T\u2010cell priming interactions. In addition to upregulation of classic costimulatory molecules, APC maturation itself results in increased T\u2010cell adhesiveness regardless of peptide presentation 109.

Although both PD\u20101 and CTLA\u20104 negatively regulate proximal TCR signals, they do so using distinct mechanisms 133. Studies have demonstrated that PD\u20101 and TCR co\u2010cluster upon pMHC engagement and coalesce within the cSMAC in stable immunological synapses 134, 135. Interactions between PD\u20101 and one of its ligands, PD\u2010L1, at membrane sites of TCR\u2013pMHC interaction serve to promote dephosphorylation of proximal TCR\u2010activating signals, which in turn blunts activation and effector functions. Dynamic in vivo studies of autoreactive CD4+ T cells have indicated that PD\u20101:PD\u2010L1 interactions disrupt TCR\u2010based stop signals, resulting in increased motility and decreased interaction times between CD4+ T cells and APCs 136. Overriding TCR\u2010induced stop signals was proposed as an important mechanism to prevent the development autoimmune disease. However, our recent work with antiviral CD8+ T cells in a model of chronic LCMV infection (using the clone 13 strain) 137 has shown that while PD\u20101 co\u2010associates with TCR at the immunological synapse, PD\u20101:PD\u2010L1 engagement promotes long\u2010term stable arrest. Instead of reducing the contact time between antiviral CD8+ T cells and APCs, PD\u20101 interactions stabilized cell contacts and immunological synapses, while remaining disruptive of proximal TCR signaling 135. In the LCMV clone 13 model of viral persistence, CTLs undergo active suppression to prevent severe immunopathology 138. We propose that motility paralysis imposed by the PD\u20101:PD\u2010L1 pathway decreases T\u2010cell scanning efficiency and facilitates continued engagement of regulatory pathways that negatively impact antiviral T\u2010cell function. Importantly, PD\u20101 blockade resulted in a rapid recovery of CD8+ T\u2010cell motility, signaling, and expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN\u03b3. PD\u20101:PD\u2010L1 management of TCR signaling quality was critical to maintaining a tolerable level of host\u2013pathogen interplay, as PD\u20101 blockade resulted in rapid initiation of viral clearance followed by IFN\u03b3\u2010mediated death of the host 135. It is interesting that PD\u20101 blockade triggers the synthesis and/or release of IFN\u03b3, which is a synaptically targeted cytokine 101. The molecular relationship between PD\u20101 signaling and IFN\u03b3 secretion is not clear, although TCR proximal signals driving IFN\u03b3 transcription are certainly involved, as PD\u20101 blockade has a rapid effect on IFN\u03b3 transcription 135. It is possible that PD\u20101 signaling blocks IFN\u03b3 shuttling to the target cell synapse, causing preformed intracellular IFN\u03b3 protein to freeze in transit for targeted release until PD\u20101 blockade unlocks the synaptic paralysis. Consistent with this model, PD\u20101 signaling has little effect on TNF\u03b1 production 135, which is a non\u2010synaptic multidirectional cytokine 101.

During some CNS viral infections, CTLs do employ lytic effector mechanisms; both perforin\u2010 and Fas\u2010dependent neuronal killing have been reported 156, 157. Certain pathogens may antagonize cytokine\u2010induced antiviral protein function, resulting in viral resistance and ongoing replication 158. The increased inflammation and pMHC expression associated with continued viral replication may override a T cell desire to act non\u2010cytopathically. However, in most cases, CTLs do not destroy infected neuronal networks, but rely instead on non\u2010cytopathic mechanisms 159 to clear viral infections. Interestingly, forced expression of neuronal MHC I leads to profound illness and death in LCMV carrier mice following adoptive immunotherapy 160. Nevertheless, adoptive immunotherapy requires CD8+ T cells and does succeed in clearing neuronal viral reservoirs from wildtype LCMV carrier mice in a TCR\u2013pMHC\u2010dependent manner without induction of overt pathology 154, 155. The CNS must therefore impose specific regulation on CTL by providing activating signals such as pMHC without eliciting the negative consequences lytic function. Initial adoptive transfer of anti\u2010LCMV memory cells into carrier mice results in robust secondary T\u2010cell expansion, rapid clearance of peripheral virus, and T\u2010cell trafficking into the virally infected CNS (Fig. \n2).

This diametric change in cytokine production was crucial to successful viral clearance, as TNF\u03b1 deficient memory T cells were unable to facilitate a reduction in viral load upon adoptive immunotherapy. Our data indicate that not only do transferred memory CTLs infiltrate the CNS of LCMV carrier mice, they also interact with CNS DCs to produce TNF\u03b1 that is required for successful immunotherapy. How CNS DCs specifically suppress directionally secreted IFN\u03b3 production while still eliciting TNF\u03b1 production is unknown, but it likely involves immunoregulatory molecules interacting with proximal TCR signaling to affect CTL secretory machinery.",

            "text": "LCMV clearance from the livers of immunotherapy recipients involves some degree of infected hepatocyte cytolysis, yet many cells are cleared non\u2010cytopathically through memory T\u2010cell cytokine production 161. Interestingly, Guidotti and colleagues 161 found that cytolysis was required to purge virus from non\u2010parenchymal liver cells and splenocytes, indicating that host cell factors may intrinsically regulate which T\u2010cell effector mechanism will most efficaciously clear a viral infection. CTL clearance of CNS coronavirus infection is also mediated by contrasting mechanisms. Bergmann et al. 162 reported that CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010derived cytolytic action (but not IFN\u03b3) was required to clear astrocytes, whereas IFN\u03b3 alone could only inhibit viral replication in oligodendroglia. In these examples of liver and CNS viral clearance, T cells presumably produce IFN\u03b3 during contact with tissue\u2010resident cell types, but somehow \u2018decide\u2019 when to abandon non\u2010lytic effector mechanisms and resort to lysing infected cells. The mechanisms that guide these fate decisions remain unclear. Very little TCR stimulation is required to induce CTL cytotoxicity, whereas stronger antigen encounters (i.e. TCR\u2013pMHC signaling) are needed to generate effector cytokine release 107. This model may explain why CTLs favor cytokine release following contact with infected hepatocytes that express high levels of pMHC; yet, this model is difficult to reconcile with observations in the CNS. Neuronal infection is certainly not associated with abundant MHC I presentation, which should favor engagement of lytic effector mechanisms, but these serial low peptide encounters within the CNS typically do not result in killing and instead bias antiviral T cells toward cytokine release and non\u2010cytopathic clearance. Following adoptive immunotherapy in LCMV carrier mice, we have observed juxtaposed antiviral CTLs and neurons, suggestive of a productive interaction (Fig. \n2\nE, F). However, our preliminary dynamic studies of CTL interactions with virally infected neurons suggest that the preponderance of these interactions is very rapid, and T cells for the most part remain highly motile (authors' unpublished observations). CXCL10, a CXCR3 ligand, is expressed by neurons in the virally infected CNS 163, and CXCR3 ligands suppress TCR activation and override stop signals to \u2018force\u2019 motility upon T cells 164. These findings might explain rapid migration along infected neurons with a lack of cytotoxicity, but it remains unclear how antigen\u2010specific T cells produce antiviral effector cytokines under these conditions of enforced motility. We have shown that LCMV infection of mice with a restricted T\u2010cell repertoire directed against OVA (OT\u2010I mice) results in establishment of a novel carrier state in which viral tropism is expanded to include astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in addition to neurons 165. Immunotherapeutic memory T\u2010cell transfer into OT\u2010I carrier mice results in uncharacteristic illness and death during viral clearance. OT\u2010I mice have Tregs with highly restricted TCR expression in addition to reduced Treg numbers. We found that co\u2010transfer of Treg cells with antiviral memory T cells significantly dampened pathologic T\u2010cell activity, while still allowing for eventual viral clearance in OT\u2010I carrier mice 165. The role for Tregs in the TCR diverse LCMV carrier model is unknown, but it is possible that only interactions with certain infected cell types require mediation by Tregs, and normal neuronal clearance (as observed in wildtype carrier mice) can unfold safely. Mechanistically, the role for cell\u2010mediated suppressive effects within the CNS remains unclear and in fact varies widely based on the model under investigation 139. How neurons dictate their preferred effector mechanisms from CTLs is still a mystery, although TCR\u2013pMHC interactions are a key element of the decision\u2010making process. Further work is needed to elucidate how these non\u2010pathologic T cells integrate the TCR\u2013pMHC interactions in the CNS with potentially unique molecular queues that bias T cells away from cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "The life of a T cell revolves around TCR\u2013pMHC interactions. In the beginning, the positive and negative selection synapses formed between T cells and thymic APCs (i.e. DCs and medullary thymic epithelial cells) result in clonal expansion of progenitors for further diversification and selection as well as clonal deletion, but do not result in effector differentiation or effector activity. TCR\u2013pMHC interactions regulate these diverse outcomes, potentially through accessory molecules or differential signaling 166, 167. Once in the periphery, tonic TCR signaling due to interactions with self\u2010peptides supports T\u2010cell survival 168, until the TCR encounters activating pMHC complexes. Mature APC encounter leads to TCR\u2013pMHC interactions that synergize with costimulatory molecules and the extracellular milieu to initiate the priming synapse and drive T\u2010cell proliferation and acquisition of specific effector functions. Following a successful priming synapse, T cells can form effector synapses that result in authorization to execute an effector program through cytokine/chemokine production and cytolytic granule release. Bifurcation of freshly activated T cells into memory or effector precursor cells can result from asymmetric division 169, 170; however, it remains unclear what role TCR\u2013pMHC signaling plays in directing asymmetric division. TCR\u2013pMHC interactions drive cell division in peripheral tissues 48, yet it remains unknown whether these division events are asymmetric. If indeed asymmetric division does occur within peripheral tissues, it could play an underlying role in generating tissue\u2010resident memory cells 171.",

Every time a TCR interacts with pMHC, the interaction results in information transfer through TCR proximal signals that depend on the TCR\u2013pMHC affinity and synaptic partners. Controlling the outcome of TCR\u2013pMHC encounters is paramount for pathogen clearance and immunopathology. In some target organs, CTLs kill directly without the requirement for APC interactions. Within the CNS, CTLs typically appear to favor non\u2010cytotoxic effector mechanisms. Understanding how TCR signals integrate with immunomodulators and secreted factors in the milieu to deliver varied effector programs will allow for a greater potential to manipulate and tune T\u2010cell responses to promote viral clearance while preventing undesirable immunopathology.",
