COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities have higher percentages of neutrophils, neutrophil ratio, inflammatory biomarkers, and lower percentages of lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, and albumin. This also suggests that patients with comorbidities have a high prevalence of progression to severe disease, and are more likely to induce bacterial infections and cause inflammatory storm. Therefore, for such patients, targeted diagnosis and management and early treatment of basic diseases are of great significance for reducing patient mortality and effectively preventing and controlling the epidemic (10, 11). The autopsy on patients died of COVID-19 Pneumonia demonstrated that the structure of myocardial cells in patients was intact, and only a small amount of monocyte infiltration in the intercellular substance was observed(12, 13).Our study also did not observe a significant increase in the biomarkers that directly cause myocardial damage in critical group.

Once the activation of inflammatory pathways in patients activated, it was very likely to quickly cause organ failure and eventually threaten life (16) . Immunological research (8, 17) showed that IL-6 is an important pathway to induce inflammatory storms, and patients with COVID-19 virus infection are different from the previous SARS virus, some patients may have early onset and are not severe or even mild symptoms. However, the activation of the later inflammatory storm may accelerate the patient into a state of multiple organ failure, especially in patients with comorbidities. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the AST, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products were significantly higher in the non-survivor group than in the survivor group.",

Our multivariate stepwise regression analysis shows that elevated AST, SSA, and D-dimer are risk factors of death in patients with comorbidities. This also reminds us that in the treatment of patients with severe pneumonia, we must not only strengthen the control of inflammatory factor storms, but also pay special attention to the treatment of basic diseases and the protection of organ functions.Patients with comorbidities in COVID-19 Pneumonia are a special kind of group, and these patients are often in serious condition at admission and have a risk of poor prognosis. Therefore, the evaluation of comorbidities and the establishment of the risk classification of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission can help to classified management and determine which patients are more likely to have serious adverse outcome in the progression of pneumonia. The results of this study also suggest that we need to pay attention to the treatment of patients' basic diseases in the future treatment, early intervention in inflammatory storms, and protection of other organs. This study still has many disadvantages. It is only a single-center descriptive study, focusing on the starting point and outcome of patients. In the future, it is necessary to expand the sample size and track the development of disease.",
