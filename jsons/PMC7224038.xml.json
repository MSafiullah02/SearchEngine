            "text": "Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions successfully controlling many serious infectious diseases and saving millions of lives globally each year [1]. However, as with any medical treatment or drug, vaccination can never be entirely risk free in terms of unwanted side effects. An important feature of vaccination is that unlike most therapeutic drugs, vaccines are given prophylactically to healthy individuals, often young children. When an event occurs shortly after vaccination in an otherwise healthy individual without an obvious cause, it is tempting to attribute its occurrence to the preceding vaccination. The assumption of a causal association with a vaccine from purely a temporal association is often incorrect as unrelated events will occur by chance irrespective of vaccination. It can be hard to disentangle these temporal associations when there is a strong perception that a temporal association is necessarily evidence of a causal association and the onset of the condition is insidious and its timing relies on patient or parental recall [2]. Even if only based on a temporal sequence of events, it is important that such safety concerns are rapidly investigated with robust epidemiological studies to allow mitigation procedures to be put in place if an association is confirmed or, if unfounded, to have the necessary evidence to sustain public confidence in the vaccination programme without which coverage drops and disease control is lost.",

The method only requires information on the timing of cases during a defined observation period and their vaccination status [5]. The cases act as their own controls as the incidence of the event in pre-defined risk periods following vaccination is compared to the incidence outside the risk period generating a relative incidence (RI) measure (Fig. 1). A significant advantage of the method is that confounding factors that do not vary over the observation period, such as co-morbidities or sociodemographic status, are automatically controlled for. Adjustment for time-varying confounders such as age is also possible by dividing up the observation period further into age categories. It has been demonstrated that the power of the SCCS method is nearly as good as a cohort study when uptake is high and risk intervals are short, and it is superior to that of a case-control study [6].",

For vaccinations given in the short age range in the first and second year of life or during a short calendar period to target ages, close matching of the controls on date of birth is required. Prior vaccination status is then compared between cases and controls using the date of onset in cases as a reference date. To obtain enough power to assess the required risk, multiple controls per case are often needed and defining appropriate criteria for the selection of controls can be problematic. While it is important to ensure that controls are similar to cases on characteristics such as age and geographical location that can independently affect vaccination status, over matching is a risk if too many extraneous variables are included in the matching, resulting in loss of efficiency and potentially introducing bias. A case-control study does not provide absolute risk estimates, rather it measures the odds of vaccination in cases compared to controls. However, as with the SCCS method, if the number of doses given to the population from which the cases are derived is known and if ascertainment is complete, then absolute risks can be estimated and the cases attributable to vaccination estimated from the magnitude of the odds ratio.",

Each case is matched to a population coverage estimate and this is then used to see if the number of cases vaccinated is greater than expected.

Because Pandemrix\u2122 was rolled out over a short period of time in the winter season of 2009/10 targeting children of different ages according to whether they had certain co-morbid conditions, it was necessary to have detailed information on dates of vaccination and dates of birth to estimate the population coverage for each narcolepsy case by age and time period. This was available from a representative subset of general practices in England, which also provided information on co-morbidities, the only other variable considered as a potential confounder [14]. In the first study assessing the risk of narcolepsy in children [14], both the SCCS method and the case-coverage design was used. The results from the SCCS method were found not to be clear as this method requires the incidence in a pre-specified risk period after vaccination relative to the baseline incidence to be compared. Because the duration of the risk period had not been defined at the time, the post-vaccination interval was found to be too short and resulted in the inclusion in the baseline period of four patients with symptoms more than 6 months after vaccination.",

The overall relative risk for GBS after seasonal vaccine was marginally increased at 1.22 (95% CI 1.01\u20131.48), with a somewhat larger relative risk of 1.84 (1.36\u20132.50) for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine but this was not significantly higher than the relative risk for seasonal vaccine [33]. The authors did not find any statistically significant differences by geographical region nor between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines. An earlier meta-analysis of studies using the SCCS method also found a small elevated risk of GBS after the monovalent H1N1 pandemic vaccine, with an RI of 2.42 (95% CI 1.58\u20133.72) in the 42 days following vaccination [34]. Similarly, Salmon et al. found an RI of 2.35 (95% CI 1.42\u20134.01) in a large study in the USA [35].",

Not only can the diagnosis be lengthy and complex, but admitted patient care databases, which are widely used for a non-biased ascertainment of cases in vaccine safety studies, are incomplete as patients experiencing narcolepsy may not be admitted and if they are admitted, the admission date is not an accurate reflection of the onset of the narcolepsy symptoms leading to misclassification bias. An important consideration when selecting cases is the awareness of the hypothesised association. This awareness may lead to an increased reporting of cases known to be vaccinated and has two aspects; public awareness and professional awareness. First, this heightened awareness may lead to vaccinated individuals presenting to healthcare institutions and being diagnosed earlier than unvaccinated cases leading to ascertainment bias. If a condition has an insidious onset making the recall of the first symptom difficult to determine, media attention may lead to a differential recall of the symptom-onset date in the vaccinated cases. Using source documents, which were created prior to any media attention in the country of study, can address this potential recall bias. Professional awareness is likely to occur even if media attention is low, as health professionals in the specialty will be aware of current topics of interest through professional bodies and literature. Differential misclassification bias will occur if cases known to have been vaccinated are more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of narcolepsy than unvaccinated cases. In the study from England, public awareness of the association was assessed by analysing Google searches for \u201cnarcolepsy\u201d in the period of interest and found there was little activity in the UK compared to Sweden (Fig. 2) [14].",

The evidence does not support an association between MS and the hepatitis vaccine, while for GBS and influenza vaccines the evidence suggests a small increased risk though it is much smaller than the risk from a natural influenza virus infection. The now established association between narcolepsy and Pandemrix\u2122 should act as a lesson for the vaccine safety community that sometimes unexpected but serious conditions can arise and need to be investigated rapidly however biologically implausible. The neurological vaccine safety issues outlined here demonstrate that rapid assessments of safety signals are needed to ensure that public confidence is maintained in national immunisation programmes. The confirmation of a signal and estimation of the magnitude of vaccine-attributable risk will require consistent results from a number of well-designed epidemiological studies, preferably conducted in different settings. As the experience with narcolepsy has shown, not all vaccine safety concerns can be anticipated on the basis of biologically plausible and thus predictable effects. As new vaccines are introduced, the basis of discussions on vaccine safety should be the acceptance that vaccination can carry a small risk but that this risk needs to be balanced against the enormous individual and public health benefits.",
