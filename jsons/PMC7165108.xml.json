As of April 12, 2020, more than 1.8 million people were confirmed to have been infected and tested positive for COVID-19, with over 114,000 deaths worldwide [2].

Its diameter is about 65\u2013125 nm, containing single strands of RNA and provided with crown-like spikes on the outer surface. SARS-CoV2 is a novel \u03b2-coronavirus after the previously identified SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which led to pulmonary failure and potentially fatal respiratory tract infection and caused outbreaks mainly in Guandong, China and Saudi Arabia. In COVID-19 research, many studies have demonstrated that bats are suspected as the key reservoir of the viruses by finding as much as 96.2% identical genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with bat CoV RaTG13 [3,7]. In this review, we hypothesize that since the COVID-19 virus has several complex immune-evasion components that contribute to its virulence, we suggest this more complete understanding can be used to develop an effective approach in the treatment of diseases caused by this virus.",

Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 has four main structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and also several accessory proteins [9]. The spike or S glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of about 150 kDa found in the outer portion of the virus. S protein forms homotrimers protruding in the viral surface and facilitates binding of envelope viruses to host cells by attraction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lower respiratory tract cells. This glycoprotein is cleaved by the host cell furin-like protease into 2 sub units namely S1 and S2. Part S1 is responsible for the determination of the host virus range and cellular tropism with the receptor binding domain make-up while S2 functions to mediate virus fusion in transmitting host cells [3,10,11].",

The process of CoV entering into the host cell begins through the attachment of the S glycoprotein to the receptor, the ACE2 in the host cells (such as in type II pneumocytes in the lungs) [15]. This attachment occurs in the binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors which are present at 331 to 524 residues, and can bind strongly to human ACE2 and bat ACE2 [13].

Furthermore, through mediation of MyD88, this introduction will trigger the activation of NF-\u03baB transcription factors and the pathogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway to induce proinflammatory proteins. Meanwhile, activation of endosomal receptors such as TLR-3 and TLR that could recognize the RNA or dsRNA genome of coronavirus leads to recruitment of TRIF adapter protein directly. TRIF subsequently activates the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors to induce proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2. Although the introduction of PAMP through TLR-4 can also recruit TRIF adapter proteins, the recruitment must be mediated by TRAM and TIRAM [15,[25], [26], [27]]. This secret of proinflammatory cytokines is the initial response in the first line of defense against virus infection. Furthermore, type I INF in turn will form complexes with its receptors, IFNAR and subsequently activate the JAK-STAT pathways. JAK1 and TYK2 kinases further phosphorylate STAT1 and 2 followed by its complexation with IRF9, and together they migrate into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and lead to suppression of viral replication and prevent the severity of the disease [25]. However, excess releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, and chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 from immune effector cells causes hyperinflammation which will eventually lead to ARDS [28,29].",

The composition of the viral RNA genome including SARS-CoV which has a 5 \u2032cap less than the host cell RNA makes it easy for immune system cells to recognize its presence and induce an immune response. To get around this, the virus developed a strategy of mimicking the host capping machinery. This strategy employs two non-structural proteins namely nsp 14 which initiates cap formation, and subsequently follows modifying the cap of viral RNAs by nsp 16 so that RNA viral seems similar to host cell RNA and avoids any PRRs recognition [27,34,35].",

            "text": "Other nonstructural proteins from coronavirus that also have the ability to prevent this virus from immune responses are nsp3 that encoded two functional proteins, macrodomains and PLpro (cleavage of nsps). Both of these proteins appear to be employed as actors in the evading of SARS-CoV from immune response-induce viruses. This possibility was supported by Fehr et al. in their in vivo study in BALB/c mice that were infected by SARS-CoV-lacking macrodomains. The findings of this study revealed that although there was an increase in expression of type I IFN, ISG15, CXCL10 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF, followed by significantly higher survival, there was no lung pathology development in the mice [36]. The finding is closely similar to other studies conducted in mice demonstrating a lack of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity in MERS-CoV. DUB is another role of PLpro to help coronavirus evade attack from a host's immune response by antagonizing the IFN response. From these findings, we hypothesized that the decline in function of the two proteins may lead to the direct introduction and sticking of immune troops to continuously infected cells and prevented the replication of the virus and the life cycle [37,38]. In addition to using nonstructural proteins, SARS-CoV could utilize its protein accessories to avoid immune responses. For example the gene segment located on ORF3b of this virus has the ability to antagonize the INF signaling pathway and cause inhibition of the effector cell activation cascade for eradication and inhibition of viral replication [39]. Equally of concern, the protein encoded in ORF6 could inhibit JAK-STAT signaling pathway by binding to karyopherin-\u03b12, and tethers karyopherin-\u03b21 on internal membranes to lead to blocking nuclear translocation of the transcription factor STAT1 [27].",

Accordingly, the therapeutic approach that can be done is to use another \u03b2-coronavirus approach such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV treatments. Some possible therapies can be given according to the approaches including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. Aerosol inhalation of alpha-interferon twice per night also could be used. In some cases coronaviruses (such as MERS-CoV) have commonly used combinations of interferon-\u03b1 combined with ribavirin [40,41]. This therapy seems to be able to give results at the beginning of therapy, that is 14 days after being diagnosed, but this effect disappears when entering day 28. Furthermore, Loutfy et al. found that the combination of interferon with steroid drugs can accelerate lung repair and increase oxygen survival levels. Therapy using interferon-\u03b1 is still confusing. Other studies have concluded that this therapy does not have a beneficial effect on patients [38,42].",

Furthermore, the existence of mapping and genomic characterization of these proteins has increasingly answered the puzzle in the development of this vaccine [44,45]. Research by Yang et al. that used combined DNA demonstrated protein S could activate the immune response through T cell production that subsequently form antibodies which can neutralize the virus in mice. Another study shown that this strategy was effective to elicit protective immunity producing neutralizing antibodies in mice [46,47]. Further studies with closely similar results conducted by Gao et al. and He et al. that used reconstructed vaccine which originated from S1 fragment of SARS-CoV revealed that it could stimulate immune response and induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies to blocking S protein binding and prevent SARS-CoV entry [48,49].",
