In humans there are 18 \u2423 and 8 \u2424 subunits which are involved in focal adhesion complexes comprising over 20 signaling and adaptor proteins, regulating actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility [10] . Binding of an integrin receptor to its ligand results in largescale conformational changes such as separation of the cytoplasmic domains of the \u2423 and \u2424 subunits which causes cytoskeletal rearrangements and activation of downstream signaling [11] . According to the current concept, integrins act as specific sensors for dynamic changes in the microenvironment that occur during tissue development, inflammation, and tumorigenesis, and modulate cellular responses to these changes [6, 7, 9] .",

Pulmonary EC express an array of innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), as well as cytokine, growth factor and histamine receptors, involved in the regulation of dynamic interactions of the epithelium with the environment. Integrin receptors are significantly represented in pulmonary epithelium. Eight different integrin heterodimers are expressed in airway EC, i.e. \u2423 2 \u2424 1, \u2423 3 \u2424 1, \u2423 6 \u2424 4, \u2423 9 \u2424 1, \u2423 5 \u2424 1, \u2423 v \u2424 5, \u2423 v \u2424 6, \u2423 v \u2424 8 [7] . These heterodimers recognize a range of ECM proteins: collagen I, tenascin C, laminins 5, 10, 11, osteopontin, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and others [7] . It is known that lung epithelial integrins are critical for maintaining epithelial integrity, repair of damaged cells, and regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation [7, 15] . The expression of integrin receptors in the respiratory epithelium is tightly regulated, and rapid increase in \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrin level in response to injury has been dem-onstrated [16] . Accordingly, integrin receptor ligands such as Fn, Vn, tenascin C, and osteopontin are rapidly induced at sites of epithelial damage or injury [7] .",

Lung epithelial integrins are known to provide co-stimulatory signals towards growth factor receptors, regulating cell survival and proliferation [reviewed by 7 ]. However, the co-stimulatory functions of pulmonary integrins appear to be wider and involve the cross talk with other receptors. We have recently found that \u2424 1 integrins in human bronchial EC provide costimulatory signals that increase TNF-induced proinflammatory responses [17] .

On the other hand, the resulting integrin-mediated signaling is potentially important for innate immune and inflammatory responses to the pathogen.

In these cases, integrin receptors recognize the common arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence that is present in ECM proteins, such as Fn or Vn [30] . The resulting integrin-mediated signaling does not seem to depend on the type of the interactions, as both direct and indirect binding to integrins lead to tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, recruitment of adaptor molecules, and cytoskeletal rearrangement required for bacterial engulf-ment, as well as induction of proinflammatory cellular responses. However, the number of known microbial ECM-binding adhesins greatly outweighs those that bind integrins directly.",

More specifically, it is the signaling via the Src family of PTKs that is necessary, since Src inhibitors and certain Src-deficient cell lines show decreased S. aureus uptake [46, 47] . Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is another PTK whose inhibition results in decreased S. aureus invasion, suggesting a role of FAK as a signaling intermediate between integrins and Src [48] . The serine-threonine protein kinase integrinlinked kinase (ILK) is attached to the actin cytoskeleton, and is also necessary for S. aureus uptake, emphasizing the importance of actin remodeling for the internalization of bacteria [49] . In addition, S. aureus binding to integrins via FnBP can activate actin remodeling that results in increased bacterial motility on the cell surface preceding the internalization [50] .

It has been known since the 1980s that S. pyogenes is capable of binding Fn, and that the attachment to ECM proteins may be important in invasion of the epithelium [53, 54] . This is now understood to be due to numerous FnBPs present on the surface of S. pyogenes , particularly M1 protein and PrtF1/SfbI [55] . Cue et al. [56] found that S. pyogenes binding of Fn via M1 protein was critical for invasion of EC, and that this process was abrogated by antibodies to \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrin. Using integrin inhibitors, it was demonstrated that the invasion of EC by streptococci was mediated by formation of integrin \u2423 5 \u2424 1-Fn-M1 protein complexes [57] . However, M1-/SfbI+ strains of S. pyogenes are also capable of invading EC in an integrinmediated fashion suggesting the redundancy in the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis [58, 59] . More recent studies have demonstrated that blocking of ILK, a key molecule in integrin-mediated signaling, abolished S. pyogenes uptake [49] . Downstream of ILK, phosphorylation of the adaptor protein paxillin has been shown to be crucial in M1+ S. pyogenes internalization [60] .

Indeed, during infection of lung EC with S. pyogenes , gene transcription of \u2423 5 integrin and Fn greatly increased and was followed by an increase in both \u2423 5 integrin and Fn protein expression by EC [61] . Moreover, S. pyogenes are able to induce active transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u2424 1 production in human tonsil fibroblasts, and TGF-\u2424 1 in turn upregulates the expression of both \u2423 5 integrin and Fn [62] . As a result of an increased \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrin expression, a subsequent increase in streptococcal invasion occurred, this time in an FnBP-dependent manner [62] . The latter study also suggested that S. pyogenes -infected fibroblasts can represent chronic sources of TGF-\u2424 1 in vivo, causing upregulation of integrins in the surrounding epithelium. Interestingly, there appears to be a reciprocal interaction between TGF-\u2424 and integrin receptors, as \u2423 v \u2424 6 integrin can bind TGF-\u2424 latency-associated peptide and activate TGF-\u2424 [63] . This study suggested that the complex interplay involving TGF-\u2424 and integrin \u2423 v \u2424 6 in lung EC initiated by microbial compounds is critical in lung innate immune defense [63] .",

However, the mycobacteria also invade EC in the respiratory mucosa, and this may represent the site of primary uptake of bacteria during the infection process [66] . Although the molecular mechanisms behind mycobacterial invasion of pulmonary EC remain largely undefined, some data indicate that integrin receptors as well as their ECM protein ligands can be significantly involved. Fn was first implicated in M. bovis adherence to bladder epithelium [67, 68] , and later it appeared that both attachment and internalization via Fn binding were highly conserved in mycobacteria [69] . Middleton et al.

B. pertussis binding to \u2423 M \u2424 2 integrin activates cell signaling pathways which lead to upregulation of \u2424 3-containing integrins and the integrin-associated protein CD47, which in turn upregulates \u2423 M \u2424 2 [84] . The bacterium is thus able to exploit integrins using a positive feedback loop, resulting in increased survival and persistence at the site of infection. In addition, B. pertussis produces a repeat in toxin (RTX) adenylate cyclase toxin called CyaA, which further exploits \u2423 M \u2424 2 integrins in macrophages by binding them and subsequently converting cellular ATP to cAMP, suppressing the bactericidal activities of these cells [reviewed by 85 ]. Recent studies demonstrated that via interaction with \u2423 M \u2424 2 integrins, the adenylate cyclase toxin also induces cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in macrophages. The latter protein can then significantly contribute to the inflammatory responses caused by B. pertussis [86] . B. pertussis is also able to invade host EC through the interactions of FHA with \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrins [83] . Such interactions appeared to be important not only for bacterial invasion, but also for inflammatory responses. Indeed, in vitro engagement of \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrins by FHA caused RGDdependent activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) and, as a result, up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in lung EC [87, 88] .",

The major virulence factor of H. influenzae is the polysaccharide capsule. Encapsulated strains of H. influenzae are designated as types a, b, c, d, e, and f according to their capsular antigens, type b being the most important clinically and causing severe invasive diseases, i.e. meningitis, epiglottitis, and septicemia. H. influenzae that lack capsular polysaccharides are referred to as nontypeable and are less virulent. Many clinical isolates of nontypeable H. influenzae are able to bind ECM proteins [90] . For example Hap, an ubiquitous nonpilus adhesin of H. influenzae, specifically binds to Fn, laminin and collagen IV, and such interactions mediate bacterial adhesion to the ECM [91] . These data suggest that H. influenzae can indirectly bind integrin receptors representing the natural ligands for these ECM proteins in the respiratory epithelium, i.e. \u2423 5 \u2424 1, \u2423 3 \u2424 1, \u2423 v \u2424 6 [7] . However, integrin involvement in adherence of H. influenzae to the respiratory epithelium has not been directly explored. Nevertheless, the uptake of nontypeable H. influenzae by M cells in the intestinal epithelium was mediated by \u2423 5 \u2424 1 integrin along with TLR-4 and platelet-activating factor receptor, as demonstrated by the blocking of translocation of bacteria into M cells in the presence of specific receptor inhibitors [92] .",

Such viruses directly bind to a variety of integrins present in the respiratory epithelium, e.g. \u2423 2 \u2424 1, \u2423 3 \u2424 1, \u2423 5 \u2424 1, \u2423 v \u2424 5, \u2423 v \u2424 6, and use them as receptors to attach to the cells and enter them.

Several viruses, e.g. Coxsackieviruses, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, human parechoviruses, and echoviruses possess a functional RGD motif in one of their capsid proteins that allow viruses to bind integrins, i.e. \u2423 v \u2424 3 or \u2423 v \u2424 6 [101] .

Among the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), TLRs are key molecules that sense the invasion of pathogens based on their typical molecular structures, such as LPS, peptidoglycans, flagella, single-stranded or doublestranded RNA, CpG DNA, etc. [103] . Such structures are unique to microorganisms in contrast to metazoans, and therefore allow for discrimination between self and nonself that is essential for immune defense [103] . Upon their activation, TLRs induce signal transduction leading to inflammatory responses and eventually to elimination of the invader. However, microorganisms are capable of binding various receptors of host cells resulting in complex cellular responses. It has now been recognized that there exists a huge diversity in innate immune receptors, in addition to the best-studied TLRs. The importance of non-TLR PRRs, such as Nod-like receptors, C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, or protease-activated receptors, as integral components of innate immune recognition, has been recently discussed in several excellent reviews [104] [105] [106] . The role of integrins as PRRs is still unclear, although leukocyte integrins serving as complement receptors, e.g. Mac-1, are recognized as PRRs for certain pathogens [107] . The role of epithelial integrins in innate immunity is even less understood, despite the fact that these receptors are highly expressed in mucosal surfaces, such as airway EC.",

As outlined above, integrins are able to bind a wide variety of microorganisms, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that integrin receptors are able to sense diverse pathogen-associated molecular structures, although many of the specific ligands involved in such pathogen-host interactions are still unknown. Interestingly, a variety of microorgan-isms, i.e. S. aureus , S. pyogenes , mycobacteria, S. pneumoniae , possess various Fn-binding proteins allowing interactions with integrin heterodimers using Fn as a molecular bridge. Remarkably, the subsequent cellular responses are different from those elicited by Fn alone. Some other pathogens bind directly to integrins, forgoing the use of ECM proteins. For example, Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin interacts directly with \u2424 1 integrins, as does B. pertussis FHA [18, 81, 83] . Interestingly, FHA binds to integrins via an RGD domain like the interaction between integrin receptors and their natural ECM ligands ( fig. 1 ) .",

During the last decade, it has become clear that integrins significantly participate in various host-pathogen interactions involving pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many bacteria possess adhesins that can bind either directly or indirectly to integrins. However, there appears to be an emerging role for Integrin binding protein Integrin Fig. 1 . The most important bacterial interactions with epithelial integrin receptors. Microorganisms can interact with lung epithelial integrins either directly via integrin-binding proteins or indirectly by using an extracellular martix protein, e.g. Fn or Vn, as a molecular bridge to engage these receptors. 13 integrins beyond simply adhesion molecules. Given the extremely conserved nature of integrin structure and function, and the diversity of the pathogens which use integrins, it appears that they may act as PRRs, involved in bacterial recognition and initiation of the innate immune response. However, the role of integrin receptors in host defense still remains poorly understood. Although a number of studies identified integrins as receptors used by pathogenic bacteria for their internalization by host cells, the significance of this process for innate immunity is not clearly defined. Internalization of bacteria may represent an important step in host defense. Indeed, internalized bacteria may be cleared due to inflammatory signaling initiated by intracellular Nod-like receptors and endo-some-located TLRs, or as a result of apoptosis of infected cells. Furthermore, internalization may be critical in activation of adaptive immunity because infected cells, including mucosal EC, are able to present microbial antigens to lymphocytes [115, 116] . However, although the results from some studies suggest the role of integrins as innate recognition receptors important for mucosal immune defense, there remain many questions to be answered.",

Of interest, aerosolized integrin inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit pulmonary inflammatory responses by blocking leukocyte infiltration into the lung using in vivo models of allergic asthma [117] [118] [119] . Although these studies did not investigate infectious processes, they demonstrated the feasibility of employing integrin inhibitors in vivo to suppress lung inflammation. Would it be possible to use integrin inhibitors to interfere with bacteria-host interactions to alleviate potentially detrimental integrin-mediated cellular responses? Although more studies into the mechanisms of pathogenintegrin interactions are required before this question can be answered, the inhibition of integrins may represent a promising new tool to combat pulmonary infections. The resulting signaling cascade leads to inflammatory cellular responses, i.e. via phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and a subsequent activation and nuclear translocation of NF-B followed by gene expression of various proinflammatory molecules. Integrinmediated signaling also leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and bacterial internalization via activation of PI3-K and small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. Some bacteria are also capable to bind integrins directly, which results in similar signaling events (not shown).",
