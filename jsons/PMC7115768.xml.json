Leishmania chagasi, in Latin America) and is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Basin, Middle East, and South America (Desjeux, 2004). Canines are the main reservoir for the parasite in different geographical regions of the globe and play a relevant role in transmission to humans (Deane, 1961, Dantas-Torres, 2006). Thus, the current strategy for control of the disease includes the detection and elimination of seropositive dogs alongside vector control and therapy for human infection (Tesh, 1995). Chemotherapy in dogs still does not provide parasitological cure (Noli and Auxilia, 2005), and for this reason a vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) would be an important tool in the control of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and would also dramatically decrease the infection pressure of L. chagasi for humans (Hommel et al., 1995, Dye, 1996).",

LBSap vaccine is considered safe for administration, without induction of ulcerative lesions at the site of inoculation (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008). Moreover, LBSap vaccinated dogs presented high IFN-\u03b3 and low IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 expression in the spleen, with significant reduction of parasite load in this organ (Roatt et al., 2012). Additionally, LBSap displayed a strong and sustained induction of humoral immune response, with increased levels of anti-Leishmania total IgG as well as both IgG1 and IgG2, after experimental challenge (Roatt et al., 2012).",

In these studies, LBSap vaccine elicited strong antigenicity related to the increased levels of anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes after vaccination (Giunchetti et al., 2007), and a strong and sustained induction of humoral immune response after experimental challenge, with increased levels of anti-Leishmania total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 (Roatt et al., 2012). Furthermore, LBSap vaccinated dogs presented high IFN-\u03b3 and low IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 expression in spleen with significant reduction of parasite load in this organ (Roatt et al., 2012). In addition, LBSap vaccine displayed safety and security for the administration (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Vitoriano-Souza et al., 2008, Moreira et al., 2009).",

We observed that the group vaccinated with LBSap showed increased levels of IL-4 as compared to the C group. However, increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the LBSap group were also observed. According to Manna et al. (2008), it is possible to maintain a standard of resistance in CVL even in the presence of IL-4, as long as there are elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3. Nevertheless, our results do not suggest a typical profile linking this cytokine with a resistance or susceptibility pattern in CVL. Similar to our study, a previous study (Manna et al., 2006) did not associate IL-4 with resistance or susceptibility to natural L. chagasi infection in CVL. In contrast, levels of IL-4 in splenocytes from dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi and presenting different clinical signs, indicated that this cytokine could be a biomarker present during the course of infection in CVL (Lage et al., 2007).",

Few studies have been performed in CVL; however, existing studies show increased levels of TGF-\u03b2 in both asymptomatic and symptomatic dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi (Correa et al., 2007). Our results displayed decreased levels of TGF-\u03b2 in SLcA-stimulated cultures of LBSap group at T90. These results suggest that vaccination with LBSap may trigger reduced TGF-\u03b2 production after experimental challenge. In fact, a previous work (Alves et al., 2009) reported high levels of TGF-\u03b2 associated with increased parasite load in lymph nodes from symptomatic dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi and an association between this cytokine and CVL morbidity. Therefore, it is possible that the reduced levels of TGF-\u03b2, associated with higher levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, after L. chagasi and sand fly saliva challenge, would contribute to establishing immunoprotective mechanisms induced by LBSap vaccination.",

However, it is not a consensus that TNF-\u03b1 profile would be a good indicator of resistance or susceptibility after L. chagasi infection, considering the similar levels of TNF-\u03b1 showed in dogs presenting distinct clinical signs (De Lima et al., 2007, Lage et al., 2007). Moreover, LBSap group did not present any differences in TNF-\u03b1 levels when compared to other experimental groups. In fact, our data were similar to Leishmune\u00ae results, that did not present differences in the expression of this molecule (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009, De Lima et al., 2010). In addition, assessment of IL-12 levels in the group immunized with LBSap revealed increased levels of this cytokine at T3, T90, and T885 in the presence of VSA stimulation, compared to T0. Interestingly, higher levels of IL-12 after vaccine protocol in relation to C and LB group (T3, in VSA-stimulated cultures), and in the early period post challenge in relation to Sap and LB groups (T90, in SLcA-stimulated cultures) was the hallmark of LBSap group. Since this cytokine has been associated with protection in CVL (Strauss-Ayali et al., 2005, Menezes-Souza et al., 2011), high levels of IL-12 and impaired TGF-\u03b2 production would indicate the establishment of immunoprotective mechanisms induced by LBSap vaccination.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3 is considered an important pro-inflammatory cytokine for establishing protective immunity against the Leishmania parasite, inducing NO synthesis, and activating microbicidal function in macrophages (Trinchieri et al., 1993, Reiner and Locksley, 1995). Thus, NO is considered one of the most important molecules responsible for killing intracellular parasites such as those of the Leishmania genus (Heinzel et al., 1989, Bogdan, 2001, Sisto et al., 2001, Gradoni and Ascenzi, 2004). In this context, we found that the LBSap group had increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 after the vaccine protocol (T3), presenting sustained improvement at the early (T90) and late (T885) time points after L. chagasi experimental challenge in the presence of the SLcA stimulus, compared to T0. Interestingly, after the vaccination protocol (T3), the LBSap group showed increased levels in IFN-\u03b3 in VSA or SLcA- stimulated cultures compared to other groups. Moreover, in both early (T90) and late (T885) period post challenge, the LBSap group remained producing increased levels of Leishmania-specific IFN-\u03b3, as compared to the respective stimulated cultures (VSA or SLcA) from the other groups. Furthermore, the increased IFN-\u03b3 levels at T885 was concomitant with higher NO amounts in cultures stimulated with SLcA and VSA. Since IFN-\u03b3 is associated with a resistance profile to Leishmania infection in different experimental models (Squires et al., 1989, Andrade et al., 1999, Murray et al., 1992, Carrillo et al., 2007, Fernandes et al., 2008), our data revealed an intense Leishmania-specific induction of IFN-\u03b3 after immunization with LBSap.",
