In addition to anemia (hemoglobin 5.9 mg/dL), her history included avascular joint necrosis and acute chest syndrome requiring exchange transfusion. A previous pregnancy required weekly home blood transfusions, intravenous (IV) hydration and extended inpatient admissions. She initially intended pregnancy continuation. An admission nasal swab test for COVID-19 was negative.",

The Hematology service advised that she would need care similar to that provided in her previous pregnancy which would prove challenging during the pandemic. Providers would face delays obtaining matched blood for transfusion given multiple antibodies and potential shortages of blood products. Further, home-based care or hospitalization would increase COVID-19 exposure.",

We utilized in-hospital telemedicine consultation to decrease face-to-face exposure. The dilation and evacuation (D&E), however, was delayed because preparing matched blood products required two days. Operating room committee approval (pandemic-specific) added two days due to acute reductions in available anesthesia and nursing staff.",

The patient remained unmasked until surgery given her COVID-19 negative status. Operating room staff and providers donned N95 masks, face shields, gowns and gloves. The Anesthesia service provided usual care with deep IV sedation and mask ventilation which is not considered an aerosolizing procedure. We performed a D&E without complications.

The team empirically started doxycycline, aztreonam, flagyl and vancomycin to treat community or hospital acquired pneumonia as well as pneumonia due to aspiration or COVID-19. Her hemodynamic status improved. On HD 16, a COVID-19 retest returned positive. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg orally was added. She was discharged home on HD 18. She declined contraception. The Family Planning providers remained asymptomatic and continued to work during the 14 days after the D&E. The providers were not tested after exposure, per hospital protocol at that time.",

The pandemic strained the hospital system resulting in a prolonged preoperative process; this extended hospitalization increased her infection risk. The patient became COVID-19 positive likely due to nosocomial exposure. A test was negative on admission and a repeat test was positive 13 days later. Alternatively, the initial test may have been a false negative. Transmission of COVID-19 from healthcare workers to patients occurs in a variety of healthcare settings [4]. Exposure to healthcare workers should be minimized.",

In the setting of community transmission, pregnant women will present for abortion in the pre-symptomatic phase. In this case, even though the team did not suspect COVID-19 infection, providers used adequate PPE and remained asymptomatic. However, such protection may not be routine when patients deny COVID-19 symptoms or previously tested negative.",

Routine preoperative testing could identify COVID-19 positive patients but may not be widely available. We recommend staff providing surgical abortion or anesthesia universally use PPE advised for COVID-19 positive patients in settings with high rates of community transmission. Masking all patients provides a sensible approach to prevent transmission and aligns with current recommendations for face covering in many U.S. communities.",
