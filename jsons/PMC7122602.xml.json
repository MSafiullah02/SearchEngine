The most dominant new type of information is the sequence information produced by genetic studies. This was enabled by the Human Genome Project, an international undertaking intended to determine the complete sequence of human DNA as it is encoded in each of the 23 human chromosomes. The first draft of the sequence was published in 2001 (Lander et al. 2001) and a final version was announced in 2003 coincident with the 50th anniversary of the solving of the Watson and Crick structure of the DNA double helix. The sequence continues to be revised and refined and efforts are underway to sequence the genomes of many different individuals (1,000 Genomes Consortium, 2010). Essentially, the entire set of genetically driven events from conception through embryonic development, childhood, adulthood, and aging are encoded by the DNA blueprints within most human cells. Given a complete knowledge of these DNA sequences, we are in a position to understand these processes at a fundamental level and to consider the possible use of DNA sequences for diagnosing and treating disease.",

            "text": "The effects of this new biological information on clinical medicine and clinical informatics are difficult to predict precisely. It is already clear, however, that some major changes to medicine will have to be accommodated.\n\nGenetic sequence information in the medical record. With the first set of human genomes now available and prices for gene sequencing rapidly decreasing, it is now cost-effective to consider sequencing every patient genome or at least genotyping key sections of the genomes. The sequence of a gene involved in disease may provide the critical information that we need to select appropriate treatments. For example, the set of genes that produces essential hypertension may be understood at a level sufficient to allow us to target antihypertensive medications based on the precise configuration of these genes. Clinical trials now use information about genetic sequence to define precisely the population of patients who would benefit from a new therapeutic agent. Finally, clinicians may learn the sequences of infectious agents (such as of the Escherichia coli strain that causes recurrent urinary tract infections) and store them in a patient\u2019s record to record the precise pathogenicity and drug susceptibility observed during an episode of illness. In any case, it is likely that genetic information will need to be included in the medical record and will introduce special problems (see also 10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_2 and Masys et al. 2012). Raw sequence information, whether from the patient or the pathogen, is meaningless without context and thus is not well suited to a printed medical record. Like images (CAT scans, MRIs), sequence data can come in high information density and must be presented to the clinician in novel ways. As there are for laboratory tests, there may be a set of nondisease (or normal) values to use as comparisons, and there may be difficulties in interpreting abnormal values. Fortunately, most of the human genome is shared and identical among individuals; less than 1 % of the genome seems to be unique to individuals. Nonetheless, the effects of sequence information on clinical databases will be significant. As an example, Kaiser Permanente and UCSF recently completed identifying genome wide genetic variants in 100,000 individuals linked to their electronic health records.1 The EMERGE research network is specifically focused on genetic discovery and replication using electronic medical records and genetics (McCarty et al. 2011).\nNew diagnostic and prognostic information sources. One of the main contributions of the genome-sequencing projects (and of the associated biological innovations) is that we are likely to have unprecedented access to new diagnostic and prognostic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic markers are used to identify how a patient\u2019s genome differs from the draft genome. Diagnostically, the genetic markers from a patient with an autoimmune disease, or of an infectious pathogen within a patient, will be highly specific and sensitive indicators of the subtype of disease and of that subtype\u2019s probable responsiveness to different therapeutic agents. For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was determined to be a corona virus using a gene expression array containing the genetic information from several common pathogenic viruses.2 In general, diagnostic tools based on the gene sequences within a patient are likely to increase greatly the number and variety of tests available to the physician. Physicians will not be able to manage these tests without significant computational assistance. Moreover, genetic information will be available to provide more accurate prognostic information to patients. What is the standard course for this disease? How does it respond to these medications? Over time, we will be able to answer these questions with increasing precision, and will develop computational systems to manage this information.Several genotype-based databases have been developed to identify markers that are associated with specific phenotypes and identify how genotype affects a patient\u2019s response to therapeutics. The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) annotates mutations with disease phenotype.3 This resource has become invaluable for genetic counselors, basic researchers, and clinicians. Additionally, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) collects genetic information that is known to affect a patient\u2019s response to a drug (more on PharmGKB is described in Translational Bioinformatics, 10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_25).4 As these data sets, and others like them, continue to improve, the first clinical benefits from the genome projects will be realized.\nEthical considerations. One of the critical questions facing the genome-sequencing projects is \u201cCan genetic information be misused?\u201d The answer is certainly yes. With knowledge of a complete genome for an individual, it may be possible in the future to predict the types of disease for which that individual is at risk years before the disease actually develops. If this information fell into the hands of unscrupulous employers or insurance companies, the individual might be denied employment or coverage due to the likelihood of future disease, however distant. There is even debate about whether such information should be released to a patient even if it could be kept confidential. Should a patient be informed that he or she is likely to get a disease for which there is no treatment? What about that patient\u2019s relatives, who share genetic information with the patient? This is a matter of intense debate, and such questions have significant implications for what information is collected and for how and to whom that information is disclosed (Durfy 1993; see 10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_10). Passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in 2008 set initial federal guidelines on use of genetic information.5 Additionally, the Personal Genome Project (PGP) has been working to define open consent models for releasing genetic information.6\n\n",

It is difficult to define precisely the ways in which this discipline emerged. There are, however, two main developments that have created opportunities for the use of information technologies in biology. The first is the progress in our understanding of how biological molecules are constructed and how they perform their functions. This dates back as far as the 1930s with the invention of electrophoresis, and then in the 1950s with the elucidation of the structure of DNA and the subsequent sequence of discoveries in the relationships among DNA, RNA, and protein structure. The second development has been the parallel increase in the availability of computing power. Starting with mainframe computer applications in the 1950s and moving to modern workstations, there have been hosts of biological problems addressed with computational methods.",

It is necessary to support queries such as, \u201cWhat sequence motifs are present in this sequence?\u201d It is often difficult to represent these multiple, nested relationships within standard relational database schema. In addition, the neighbors of a sequence element are also critical, and it is important to be able to perform queries such as, \u201cWhat sequence elements are seen 20 elements to the left of this element?\u201d For these reasons, researchers in bioinformatics are developing object-oriented databases (see 10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_6) in which a sequence can be queried in different ways, depending on the needs of the user.",

            "text": "The sequence information mentioned in Sect. 24.3.1 is rapidly becoming inexpensive to obtain and easy to store. On the other hand, the three-dimensional structure information about the proteins, DNA, and RNAis much more difficult and expensive to obtain, and presents a separate set of analysis challenges. Currently, only about 75,000 three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules are known.9 These models are incredibly valuable resources, however, because an understanding of structure often yields detailed insights about biological function. As an example, the structure of the ribosome has been determined for several species and contains more atoms than any other structure to date. This structure, because of its size, took two decades to solve, and presents a formidable challenge for functional annotation (Cech 2000). Yet, the functional information for a single structure is dwarfed by the potential for comparative genomics analysis between the structures from several organisms and from varied forms of the functional complex. Since the ribosome is ubiquitously required for all forms of life these types of comparisons are possible. Thus a wealth of information comes from relatively few structures. To address the problem of limited structure information, the publicly funded structural genomics initiative aims to identify all of the common structural scaffolds found in nature and to increase the number of known structures considerably. In the end, it is the physical interactions between molecules that determine what happens within a cell; thus the more complete the picture, the better the functional understanding. In particular, understanding the physical properties of therapeutic agents is the key to understanding how agents interact with their targets within the cell (or within an invading organism). These are the key questions for structural biology within bioinformatics:\nHow can we analyze the structures of molecules to learn their associated function? Approaches range from detailed molecular simulations (Levitt 1983) to statistical analyses of the structural features that may be important for function (Wei and Altman 1998).How can we extend the limited structural data by using information in the sequence databases about closely related proteins from different organisms (or within the same organism, but performing a slightly different function)? There are significant unanswered questions about how to extract maximal value from a relatively small set of examples.How should structures be grouped for the purposes of classification? The choices range from purely functional criteria (\u201cthese proteins all digest proteins\u201d) to purely structural criteria (\u201cthese proteins all have a toroidal shape\u201d), with mixed criteria in between. One interesting resource available today is the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP),10 which classifies proteins based on shape and function.\n",

            "text": "The development of DNA microarrays has led to a wealth of data and unprecedented insight into the fundamental biological machine. The traditional premise is relatively simple; tens of thousands of gene sequences derived from genomic data are fixed onto a glass slide or filter. The sequences for each spot are derived from a single gene sequence and the sequences are attached at only one end, creating a forest of sequences in each spot that are all identical. An experiment is performed where two groups of cells are grown in different conditions, one group is a control group and the other is the experimental group. The control group is grown normally, while the experimental group is grown under experimental conditions. For example, a researcher may be trying to understand how a cell compensates for a lack of sugar. The experimental cells will be grown with limited amounts of sugar. As the sugar depletes, some of the cells are removed at specific intervals of time. When the cells are removed, all of the mRNA from the cells is separated and converted back to DNA, using reverse transcriptase (a special enzyme that can create a DNA copy from an RNA template). This leaves a pool of cDNA molecules (DNA derived from mRNA is called complementary DNA or cDNA) that represent the genes that were expressed (turned on) in that group of cells. Using a chemical reaction, a red fluorescent molecule is attached to the experimental cDNA molecules (the \u201cred group\u201d) and the cDNA from the control group is attached to green fluorescent molecules (the \u201cgreen group\u201d). These two samples are pooled together and then washed over the glass slide. The labeled cDNA in the pool sticks or hybridizes to the corresponding gene sequences in the spots on the glass slide. The molecules from the two groups will compete with each other to hybridize to the complementary sequences in the spots with the group that had more of a particular sequence binding more of the molecules stuck to the glass slide. Using a scanning confocal microscope and a laser to fluoresce the cDNA with their dye molecules, the amount of red and green fluorescence in each spot can be measured. The ratio of red to green fluorescence for a spot is a measure of the ratio of the expression of that gene product between the red and green groups. This ratio is a measure of whether a gene is being turned off (downregulated) in the experimental group or whether the gene is being turned on (upregulated). As each glass slide can hold up to 40,000 spots each experiment has the potential of measuring the activity of all the genes in a cell due to some experimental change. Expressed genes can include genes that are translated into proteins (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), regulatory microRNAs (miRNA) or other gene products. Although protein coding genes were initially the area most studied for disease, miRNAs have recently become increasingly important for disease associations because, unlike mRNA, miRNA\u2019s serve a regulatory role that determines how genes are expressed.",

Whereas the first human genome sequence was carried out over approximately 13 years at a cost of $2.7 billion (Davies 2010), whole human genomes can now be sequenced in a matter of days at a cost that is growing ever-closer to the magic, if somewhat arbitrary, $1000 price tag. This amount is commonly seen as the price at which it becomes feasible to sequence a patient in the course of clinical care, justifiable both clinically and financially. In 2004, and again in 2011, the National Human Genome Research Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health) funded a number of efforts specifically aimed at increasing speed and decreasing the cost of genome scale sequencing. In addition, in 2006 the X Prize Foundation announced the genomics X PRIZE for sequencing ten high quality genomes in 10 days for under $10,000.",

This method typically is applied to sequences ranging from 300 to 1,000 nucleotides in a non-high throughput manner.11 In the early to mid 2000s, several technologies were introduced to sequence large amounts of DNA in parallel. These technologies, including 454 Pyrosequencing, SOLiD or Solexa (now Illumina) sequencing typically determine much shorter sequences than Sanger based approaches, but can generate as many as 300 gigabases (300 \u00d7 109 bases) of sequence in short 75-base fragments at a cost well under $10,000.12 These next generation sequencing methods are being used for many applications, including identification of genetic variants in clinical studies, characterizing genome function with specific experiments and sequencing novel species genomes. These studies have already discovered the genetic basis of rare genetic disorders by sequencing entire families (Ng et al. 2010), and we have seen a glimpse of the future of genome sequencing for routine health care in the analysis of both a single genome of a healthy man (Ashley et al. 2010) and a family of four (Dewey et al. 2011). Currently, we are seeing the introduction of third generation sequencing technologies that promise higher throughput, single molecule sequencing, higher accuracy, or lower cost. One emergent area of research is metagenomics, the study of microorganism ecosystems using DNA sequencing, including the association of human gut flora populations to disease phenotypes in humans (Qin et al. 2010).",

Several types of epigenetic effects can now be studied in the laboratory, and they have been associated to disease and risks of disease (Goldberg et al. 2007). First, the regional structure of chromosomes affects which regions of the genome can be transcribed, that is which regions can be expressed. Large proteins, called histones, coordinate the structure of chromosomes and their structure and positions are regulated with protein posttranslational modifications to the histones bound to the DNA. These changes have been associated with spontaneous mutations in cancer, complex genetic diseases, and Mendelian inherited genetic diseases. Second, cytosine bases in the DNA can be methylated and this can affect gene expression. DNA methylation patterns can be passed on when DNA is replicated.

In contrast to the historically reductionist approach to biology, studying one molecule at a time, systems biology looks at the entirety of a system including dynamic relationships between the different components. With that said, systems biology is still only in its infancy, and even within the field, researchers have not reached consensus on a single definition (Wishart 2008). As an analogy, consider an airplane. Having a \u201cparts list\u201d for a Boeing 747 does not enable us to understand how those parts work together to make the airplane operate. If the airplane breaks, the parts list alone does not tell us how to remedy the situation. Rather, we need to understand how the parts interact, how one affects another, and how perturbations to one part of the system affect the rest of the system. Similarly, systems biology involves understanding not only the \u201cparts list\u201d, i.e. the list of all genes, proteins, metabolites, etc., but also the dynamic networks of interactions among these parts.

The first requirement was to have a reliable way to align sequences so that their detailed similarities and distances could be examined directly. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) published an elegant method for using dynamic programming techniques to align sequences in time related to the cube of the number of elements in the sequences. Smith and Waterman (1981) published refinements of these algorithms that allowed for searching both the best global alignment of two sequences (aligning all the elements of the two sequences) and the best local alignment (searching for areas in which there are segments of high similarity surrounded by regions of low similarity). A key input for these algorithms is a matrix that encodes the similarity or substitutability of sequence elements: When there is an inexact match between two elements in an alignment of sequences, it specifies how much \u201cpartial credit\u201d we should give to the overall alignment based on the similarity of the elements, even though they may not be identical.

The first release, in 1977, contained 77 structures. The growth of the database is chronicled on the Web: the PDB now has over 75,000 detailed atomic structures and is the primary source of information about the relationship between protein sequence and protein structure.13 Similarly, as the ability to obtain the sequence of DNA molecules became widespread, the need for a database of these sequences arose. In the mid-1980s, the GENBANK database was formed as a repository of sequence information. Starting with 606 sequences and 680,000 bases in 1982, the GENBANK has grown by much more than 135 million sequences and 125 billion bases.14 The GENBANK database of DNA sequence information supports the experimental reconstruction of genomes and acts as a focal point for experimental groups.

The problem of alignment is not trivial but is based on a simple idea. Sequences that perform a similar function should, in general, be descendants of a common ancestral sequence, with mutations over time. These mutations can be replacements of one amino acid with another, deletions of amino acids, or insertions of amino acids. The goal of sequence alignment is to align two sequences so that the evolutionary relationship between the sequences becomes clear. If two sequences are descended from the same ancestor and have not mutated too much, then it is often possible to find corresponding locations in each sequence that play the same role in the evolved proteins. The problem of solving correct biological alignments is difficult because it requires knowledge about the evolution of the molecules that we typically do not have. There are now, however, well-established algorithms for finding the mathematically optimal alignment of two sequences. These algorithms require the two sequences and a scoring system based on (1) exact matches between amino acids that have not mutated in the two sequences and can be aligned perfectly; (2) partial matches between amino acids that have mutated in ways that have preserved their overall biophysical properties; and (3) gaps in the alignment signifying places where one sequence or the other has undergone a deletion or insertion of amino acids. The algorithms for determining optimal sequence alignments are based on a technique in computer science known as dynamic programming and are at the heart of many computational biology applications (Gusfield 1997). Figure 24.1 shows an example of a Smith-Waterman matrix, the first described local alignment algorithm that utilizes a dynamic programming approach. The algorithm works by calculating a similarity matrix between two sequences, then finding optimal paths through the matrix that maximize a similarity score between the two sequences.\n\n",

MinRMS generates a family of alignments, each with different number of residue position matches. This is useful for identifying local regions of similarity in a protein with multiple domains. MinRMS solves two problems. First, it determines which structural superpositions, or alignment, to evaluate. Then, given this superposition, it determines which residues should be considered \u201caligned\u201d or matched. Computationally, this is a very difficult problem. MinRMS reduces the search space by limiting superpositions to be the best superposition among four atoms. It then exhaustively determines all potential four-atom matched superpositions and evaluates the alignment. Given this superposition, the number of aligned residues is determined, as any two residues with C-alpha carbons (the central atom in all amino acids) less than a certain threshold apart. The minimum average RMSD for all matched atoms is the overall score for the alignment. In Fig. 24.2, an example of such a comparison is shown.\n\n",

The most reliable way to assess this interaction is to use experimental methods to solve the structure of a drug\u2013target complex. Once again, these experimental approaches are expensive, so computational methods play an important role.

            "text": "In the post-genomic era, there is no shortage of data to analyze. Rather, many researchers have more data than they know what to do with. However this overabundance tends to be a factor of the dimensionality of the data, rather than the number of subjects. This mismatch can lead to challenges for experimental design and statistical analysis. Type 1 error, or the tendency to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and say that indeed there is statistical significance to a pattern (see 10.1007/978-1-4471-4474-8_11), is amplified by looking at high-dimensional data. This is one aspect of what is known as the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d (Hastie et al. 2009). Consider analysis of gene expression data for 20,000 genes, trying to detect a pattern that can predict outcome. In a sample of, say, 30 subjects\u2014a reasonable number when testing a single hypothesis\u2014by random chance, some number of genes will correlate with outcome. Essentially one is testing not one but 20,000 hypotheses simultaneously. One must therefore correct for multiple hypothesis testing. The Bonferroni method is a common and straightforward approach to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.22 It entails dividing the threshold p-value one would use, traditionally 0.05, by the number of hypotheses. So, for a test of 20,000 genes, one would require a p-value of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 to call a gene significant. Typically, analyses using high dimensional data such as gene expression are not sufficiently powered to pass this stringent test. One would need thousands of samples to be sufficiently powered. Another approach is to use q-value, or false discovery rate (Storey and Tibshirani 2003), rather than p-value. This approach relies on empirical permutation to determine the expected number of false positives if indeed the null hypothesis is correct, which enables approximation of the proportion of false positives among all reported positives. Consider again the microarray experiment above in which each array includes 20,000 genes. We want to know whether gene X was differentially expressed in cases versus controls. Choosing a threshold p-value, or false positive rate, of 0.05 means that 1 time in 20 we will erroneously reject the null hypothesis and predict a false positive. If a statistical test returns 2,000 positives, i.e. 2,000 genes appear to be significantly differentially expressed, we expect 1 in 20 of the genes being analyzed (20,000 * (1/20) = 1,000) or approximately half of them to be false positives. A false discovery rate of 0.05, on the other hand, would mean that 5 % of those called positive, in this case 100 out of 2,000, are false positives. Q-value is thus less stringent than p-value, but may be of greater utility in a high-dimensional omics context than a traditional p-value or correction for multiple hypotheses.",

            "text": "Another approach to analysis of high dimensional data sets is to use dimensionality reduction methods such as feature selection or feature extraction. Feature selection entails extracting only a subset of the features at hand, in this case genes. This may be done in a number of ways, based on which genes vary the most, or on which genes seem to best predict the categorization at hand. In contrast, feature extraction creates a new smaller set of features that captures the essence of the original variation. As an example, imagine a plane flight from Seattle, WA to Key West, FL. One could use a 3-dimensional vector consisting of latitude and longitude to describe the plane\u2019s position at any given point along the way. In this case, one value would describe how far the plane had gone in the north/south direction, and one would indicate how far the plane had gone in the east/west direction. However, if we change the axis along which we are measuring to instead be the direct route along which the plane is flying, then we only need 1 dimension to describe where the plane is located. The distance flown tells us where the plane is located at any given time. This approach of changing the axes is the basis for principle components analysis (PCA), a common method for feature extraction. Instead of going from two dimensions to one, PCA on gene expression data typically goes from tens of thousands of features to just a few. Both for feature selection and feature extraction, it is important to replicate the findings in an independently generated data set in order to be sure the model is not over fitting the data on which it was trained.",

The Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), founded in 2002, has a family of markup languages (ML) for different aspects of proteomics: mzML for mass spectrometry, PSI-MI XML for molecular interactions, and mzIdentML for proteomics informatics. The FGED (Functional Genomics Data Society, formed in 1999 as MGED for Microarray Gene Expression Data Society) developed MAGE-ML (Microarray and Gene Expression Markup Language) to enable sharing of microarray data. However, it was determined that MAGE-ML was too technical and cumbersome for labs without dedicated bioinformatics support, so FGED now recommends use of MAGE-TAB, a tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, instead.25 The Metabolomics Standards Initiative was formed in 2005 to coordinate efforts among a number of existing groups and initiatives, though metabolomics standards have lagged somewhat behind the progress of their genomic and proteomic siblings (Sansone et al. 2007; Scalbert et al. 2009).",

The MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) consortium established the MIBBI project in 2008 to provide a freely accessible, web-based resource for minimum information standards and to enable owners of those standards to harmonize overlapping elements where applicable. The most well-known of these standards is MIAME, or Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment, but the MIBBI portal lists over 30 minimum information reporting guidelines (Taylor et al. 2008). These guidelines identify only the types of information that must be included. They do not specify format or semantics. For example, MIAME enumerates six required pieces of information: (1) raw data, (2) processed data, (3) sample annotation, (4) experimental design including, e.g., which raw data file relates to which sample, which hybridizations are technical versus biological replicates, (5) array annotation, and (6) lab and data processing protocols. Array annotation could include a file that identifies the sequence of each individual spot on the array, or it could simply name a standard commercial microarray chip for which annotation is readily available from the manufacturer. Either of these methods would be MIAME compliant for the array annotation component in that it would enable someone looking at the data to understand what each spot represents. One could argue that these guidelines do not go far enough\u2014without specifying semantics or format, the information cannot be computed over and is therefore less useful than it could be.

The experimental protocols used to determine precise molecular structural coordinates are expensive in time, materials, and human power. Therefore, we have only a small number of structures for all the molecules characterized in the sequence databases. The two main sources of structural information are the Cambridge Structural Database30 for small molecules (usually less than 100 atoms) and the PDB31 for macromolecules (see Sect. 24.3.2), including proteins and nucleic acids, and combinations of these macromolecules with small molecules (such as drugs, cofactors, and vitamins). The PDB has approximately 75,000 high-resolution structures, but this number is misleading because many of them are small variants on the same structural architecture. There are approximately 100,000 proteins in humans; therefore many structures remain unsolved (e.g., Burley and Bonanno 2002). In the PDB, each structure is reported with its biological source, reference information, manual annotations of interesting features, and the Cartesian coordinates of each atom within the molecule. Given knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of molecules, the function sometimes becomes clear. For example, the ways in which the medication methotrexate interacts with its biological target have been studied in detail for two decades. Methotrexate is used to treat cancer and rheumatologic diseases, and it is an inhibitor of the protein dihydrofolate reductase, an important molecule for cellular reproduction. The three-dimensional structure of dihydrofolate reductase has been known for many years and has thus allowed detailed studies of the ways in which small molecules, such as methotrexate, interact at an atomic level. As the PDB increases in size, it becomes important to have organizing principles for thinking about biological structure. SCOP32 provides a classification based on the overall structural features of proteins. It is a useful method for accessing the entries of the PDB.",

A new challenge immediately emerges, however: collecting individual sequence data from patients who have disease. Initial studies are promising for identification of the genetic cause of disease using individual or family based sequencing (Lupski et al. 2010). Currently, many researchers have chosen to sequence either entire genomes, or exomes, the regions of the genome that are transcribed into mRNA, and therefore the most likely to cause disease. Researchers now know that more than 99 % of the DNA sequences within humans are identical, but the remaining sequences are different and account for our variability in susceptibility to and development of disease states. It is not unreasonable to expect that for particular disease syndromes, the detailed genetic information for individual patients will provide valuable information that will allow us to tailor treatment protocols and perhaps let us make more accurate prognoses. There are significant problems associated with obtaining, organizing, analyzing, and using this information.",

Although we have a good understanding of the principles by which small groups of molecules interact, we are not able to explain fully how thousands of molecules interact within a cell to create both normal and abnormal physiological states. As the databases continue to accumulate information ranging from patient-specific data to fundamental genetic information, a major challenge is creating the conceptual links among these databases to create an audit trail from molecular-level information to macroscopic phenomena, as manifested in disease.

The structure of knowledge bases often leads to unique strategies for storage and retrieval of their content. To build a knowledge base for storing information from biological experiments, there are some requirements. First, the set of experiments to be modeled must be defined. Second, the key attributes of each experiment that should be recorded in the knowledge base must be specified. Third, the set of legal values for each attribute must be specified, usually by creating a controlled terminology for basic data or by specifying the types of knowledge-based entries that can serve as values within the knowledge base.",

Metadata standards help define information which should be collected and annotated upon various types of datasets. For example, the MIAME standard (Minimum Information About A Microarray Experiment) defines metadata one would annotate upon a microarray dataset. Recently, the Biosharing website36 is providing links to terminologies and standards for a wide range of data types.
