In 2003, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The potential risk to public health posed by SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses and the lack of specific antiviral agents and vaccines have triggered a global research effort to characterize this family of viruses at the molecular and cellular levels. Major advances in studies of the biological functions of individual viral proteins and replication mechanisms are currently being made by genetic manipulation of coronaviral genomes using reverse genetics and targeted recombination approaches (Almazan et al., 2000, Casais et al., 2001, Casais et al., 2003, Casais et al., 2005, Coley et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006, Koetzner et al., 1992, Masters and Rottier, 2005, Sanchez et al., 1999, Thiel et al., 2001, Youn et al., 2005a, Youn et al., 2005b, Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2002, Yount et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a group 3 coronavirus, causes an acute and contagious disease in chickens with a significant impact on the poultry industry worldwide. IBV contains a 27.6 kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. In the virus-infected cells, six mRNA species, including the genome-length mRNA 1 and five subgenomic mRNAs (mRNA 2\u20136), are produced by a discontinuous RNA transcription mechanism. Each mRNA species possesses a 64 nucleotides leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Boursnell et al., 1987). Subgenomic mRNAs 2, 3, 4, and 6 encode the four structural proteins, i.e., spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). The 5\u2032 two-third region of mRNA 1 comprises two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, and encodes two polyproteins. The two polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved by two virus-encoded proteinases, the papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, into 15 functional proteins (Nsp2\u2013Nsp16) (Lim and Liu, 1998a, Lim and Liu, 1998b, Lim et al., 2000, Liu et al., 1995, Liu et al., 1997, Liu et al., 1998, Ng and Liu, 1998, Ng and Liu, 2000, Ng and Liu, 2002, Xu et al., 2001). Compared to other coronaviruses, Nsp1 is absent in IBV but Nsp2 is considerably larger (Lim and Liu, 1998a, Lim and Liu, 1998b, Liu et al., 1995). In general, IBV shares close similarities in the genome organization, gene expression, and RNA replication with other coronaviruses but is non-infectious to human. These properties make IBV an attractive model system for studying the biology and pathogenesis of coronavirus.",

No infectious virus could be rescued from Vero cells electroporated with in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing this mutation. As this mutation causes Arg132\u2013Pro mutation in a domain with unknown function within the helicase protein (Nsp13), it implies that this region might play certain roles in the functionality of the helicase protein. On the contrary, a G\u2013C (G4330C) and a G\u2013A (G9230) point mutations at nucleotide positions 4330 and 9230, respectively, causing Glu\u2013Gln and Gly\u2013Glu mutations in or near the catalytic centers of the papain-like (Nsp3) and 3C-like (Nsp5) proteinases, did not impair the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts containing these mutations. Further characterization of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts containing the G15526C mutation demonstrated that this mutation blocks the transcription of subgenomic RNAs. Substitution mutation of the Arg132 residue to a positively charged amino acid (Lys) affected neither the infectivity of the in vitro-synthesized transcripts nor the growth properties of the rescued virus. However, mutation of the Arg132 residue to a Leu, which is conserved in most of other coronaviruses at the same position, reduced the viral recovery rate of the in vitro-synthesized full-length transcripts. The mutant virus showed much smaller-sized plaques. This study reveals the essential role of a domain with previously unassigned functions within the helicase protein in coronavirus replication.",

To facilitate the assembly of the full-length cDNA in vitro, restriction sites for either BsmBI or BsaI were introduced into both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the fragments (Fig. 1a). In fragment A, a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the T7 RNA promoter (Table 1\n) was inserted into the 5\u2032 end of the IBV genome to facilitate in vitro transcription using the T7 polymerase (Fig. 1a). The primers used to amplify these fragments are listed in Table 1. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel and cloned into either pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) or pGEM-T Easy (Promage) vectors. For the convenience of digestion using the restriction enzyme BsmBI, the NheI- and EcoRI-digested fragment A was subcloned into pKT0 which contains a BsmBI site 400 bp upstream of the T7 promoter sequence (Fig. 1a). Two to three independent clones for each construct were selected for sequencing. The complete sequences of the five fragments, determined by automated nucleotide sequencing, are summarized in Table 2\n.",

Among them, 11 caused unique amino acid changes (Table 2). To assess the deleterious effects of these mutations on the infectivity of the full-length clone, correction of some of the mutations was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis. Three point mutations, G4330C, G9230A, and G15526C, were chosen based on the fact that they are located either in or near the catalytic centers of the two viral proteinases or in a region of the RNA helicase protein with undefined functions. Four full-length cDNA clones either with correction of the mutations at all three positions (rIBV) or combination of two positions (e.g., G4330C containing G\u2013C mutation at nucleotide position 4330 but without mutations at the other two positions) were constructed. RNA transcripts generated from the four full-length cDNA clones were introduced into Vero cells together with the N transcripts by electroporation. At 2 days post-electroporation, a typical CPE of the Vero cell-adapted IBV, the formation of giant syncytial cells (Fang et al., 2005), was observed in cells transfected with transcripts generated from cDNA clones rIBV, G4330C, and G9230A. CPE was extended to almost the whole monolayers at 3 days post-electroporation (Fig. 2a). No CPE was observed in cells transfected with transcripts generated from clone G15526C (Fig. 2a).",

As shown in Fig. 4b, a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at 2 days post-electroporation (lanes 2 and 5). Sequencing of the PCR fragments confirmed that they represent the correct sequences of the corresponding regions of the subgenomic mRNAs 3 and 4, respectively. However, the same PCR products were not detected in cells electroporated with the mutant transcripts (Fig. 4b, lanes 3 and 6). As a negative control, the amplified fragments were not detected in cells without electroporation (Fig. 4b, lane 4). The failure to detect both negative- and positive-stranded sgRNAs in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts show that the G15526C mutation leads to the disruption of subgenomic RNA transcription.",

Full-length transcripts containing EGFP were synthesized in vitro and introduced into Vero cells together with the N transcripts by electroporation. At 2 days post-electroporation, single CPE with the expression of EGFP was observed in cells transfected with the full-length transcripts without the G15526C mutation (Fig. 4c). Gradually increased CPE and fluorescent cells were observed from 3 to 5 days post-electroporation (Fig. 4c). At 5 days post-electroporation, CPE and fluorescent cells were extended to almost the whole monolayer (Fig. 4c). However, it was consistently observed that much less infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with this construct. Furthermore, the recombinant virus rapidly lost infectivity when passaged on Vero cells; the recovered virus maintains minor infectivity only for one passage. In cells transfected with the full-length transcripts containing the G15526C mutation, neither CPE nor cells expressing EGFP were observed (Fig. 4c), demonstrating that G15526C mutation led to total demolition of the EGFP expression. As EGFP could be expressed only if subgenomic RNAs were synthesized but can be observed even if a single cell was transfected and expressed the protein to a certain level, these results reinforce the conclusion that the G15526C mutation blocks subgenomic RNA transcription.",

The protein is comprised of two domains: a putative N-terminal zinc binding domain, which spans the N-terminal region of the protein from approximately amino acids 1 to 77, and a C-terminal helicase domain covering the C-terminal part of the protein from amino acids 279 to the C-terminal end (Ivanov et al., 2004). A Ser\u2013Pro substitution located immediately downstream of the putative zinc binding domain of Nsp10, the equivalent RNA helicase protein in equine arteritis virus (EAV), caused defect in subgenomic mRNA transcription (van Dinten et al., 1997, van Dinten et al., 2000). More detailed analysis of the zinc binding domain of Nsp10 from EAV and Nsp13 from human coronavirus 229E by mutagenesis studies showed that this domain could modulate the enzymatic activities of the helicase domain (Seybert et al., 2005). Through this regulatory role and some yet to be discovered mechanisms, the zinc binding domain is shown to be critically involved in the replication and transcription of coronavirus RNA.",

            "text": "Why the R132P substitution, located outside of the two functional domains of the helicase protein, shows severe phenotypic defect in subgenomic RNA transcription and the infectivity of IBV is not clear at the moment. Three possibilities were considered. First, R132 may be part of the N-terminal zinc binding domain. As no studies have been attempted to define the boundary of the two domains, it is not even certain that an independent domain with unique function may exist in this region. R132P mutant virus shares certain phenotypic similarity to the Ser\u2013Pro mutant EAV, such as the absence of subgenomic mRNA transcription (van Dinten et al., 1997, van Dinten et al., 2000), suggesting that the two mutations might disrupt a similar function of the helicase protein. However, as biochemical characterization of the effect of R132P mutation on the enzymatic activities of IBV Nsp13 helicase protein is currently lacking, it would be difficult to draw a conclusion that the two mutants share mechanistically similar characteristics. Second, R132 is located in a region with a high degree of amino acid conservation in all known coronaviruses. Since the main defect of R132P mutant virus is in the subgenomic RNA transcription, one possibility is that this region may be involved in the subgenomic RNA synthesis by interacting with host or other viral functional proteins. Alternatively, as a positively charged amino acid is required to maintain the full function of the protein, it would be possible that this region may be involved in binding of the helicase protein to viral RNA during RNA replication and transcription. Finally, mutation to a Pro would lead to the disruption of the three dimensional structures of the two domains. Biochemical characterization of the involvement of this region in the enzymatic activities of the protein and determination of its three dimensional structures are underway to address these possibilities.",

Similarly, efficient recovery of infectious virus from the in vitro transcripts containing the G9230A (G\u2013E) point mutation in the 3CLP was obtained. The two mutant viruses are genetically stable and show similar growth properties with the wild type recombinant virus. Even though the two mutations are located in or near the catalytic centers of the two viral proteinases, the mutations did not alter their enzymatic activities. This relatively high degree of tolerance to mutations in non-essential regions of important functional proteins would minimize the occurrence of lethal mutations during the replication cycles of RNA viruses and increase the adaptability of these viruses to a changed environment.",

Monolayers of Vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 \u03bcl of 100-fold diluted virus stock and cultured in the presence of 0.5% carboxymethy cellulose at 37 \u00b0C for 3 days. The cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% toluidine. To determine the one-step growth curves of rIBV, R132K, and R132L mutant viruses, Vero cells were infected with the viruses and harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 36 h post-inoculation, respectively. Viral stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of the cells three times, and TCID50 of each viral stock was determined by infecting five wells of Vero cells on 96-well plates in triplicate with 10-fold serial dilution of each viral stock. Error bar shows standard error of the mean. (b) Northern blot analysis of the genomic and subgenomic RNAs in cells infected with rIBV, R132K, and R132L mutant viruses. Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from Vero cells infected with rIBV, R132K, and R132L mutant viruses, respectively, was separated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane. Viral RNAs were probed with a Dig-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the 3-end 680 nucleotides of the IBV genome. Numbers on the left indicate nucleotides in kilobase, and numbers on the right indicate the genomic and subgenomic RNA species of IBV. (c) Western blot analysis of viral protein expression in cells infected with wild type and R132 mutant viruses. Vero cells infected with wild type recombinant IBV (lane 1), R132K (lane 2), and R132L (lane 3) were harvested, lysates prepared, and separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The expression of S, N, and M proteins was analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal anti-S, anti-N, and anti-M antibodies, respectively. The same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibody as a loading control. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons.",
