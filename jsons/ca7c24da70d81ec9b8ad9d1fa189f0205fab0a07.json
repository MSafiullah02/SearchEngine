Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p<0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.",

In the absence of a cure or vaccine against COVID-19, lockdown, isolation, quarantine and limiting community interaction are main psychoneuroimmunity prevention strategies proposed by Kim and Su (2020) to reduce pathogen exposure (Kim & Su, 2020) . A recent study found that quarantine was not related with the prevalence of mental health problems in the general population (Zhu et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has a sudden and massive impact on health care infrastructure, transportation, daily activity, freedom of movement, and distribution of medical resources globally (Gautam & Sharma, 2020; Joob & Wiwanitkit, 2020; Simpson & Katsanis, 2020) . The sudden changes could significantly impact the mental health of psychiatric patients as well as reducing their access to psychiatric services (Montemurro, 2020) . Furthermore, mental health providers could be burnout as they might be deployed to look after COVID-19 patients (Kim & Su, 2020) . Rightfully, focus of health services has primarily been placed on COVID-19. However, we must also be mindful and ensure that psychiatric services are not neglected in the present pandemic. As the psychiatric inpatient wards were found to be perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus (Kim & Su, 2020) , most of the stable psychiatric patients should receive treatment at home to reduce the risk of infection.",

Ideally, immunopsychiatry service should safeguard physical and mental health of psychiatric patients by providing telepsychiatry consultation, home delivery of medications, psychological support, rapid testing for coronavirus and monitoring inflammatory markers related to stress and depression during a large infection outbreak. The immunopsychiatry service addresses the biopsychosocial aspects of COVID-19 pandemic (Kim & Su, 2020) . Due to the sudden outbreak and lack of experience with COVID-19, most mental health services were unprepared to provide above services and not able to reach out to psychiatric patients during the lockdown. As a result, the needs of psychiatric patients are being neglected during the pandemic. Although there are few known studies to date about the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general population (Li et al., 2020; Qiu, Zhou, Liu, & Yuan, 2020; Wang, 2020; , COVID patients (J.

Multiple linear regression with a backward selection method was used to examine the association between the outcome variables and the two groups of subjects as well as the demographic variables. All the analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22, and the level of significance was set at 5%. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study respondents with and without psychiatric illnesses. Of the 666 psychiatric patients who were approached, 76 completed the survey. The total response rate was 11\u00b73%. Of the 130 healthy controls who were approached, 109 completed the survey. The total response rate was 83\u00b78%. The respondents consisted of 76 psychiatric patients and 109 healthy controls who were age and gender matched. The majority of respondents from both groups were women, staying in a household with 3 to 5 family members with a mean age of 32 years. There was a significantly higher proportion of healthy controls who held an undergraduate degree (61\u00b75%) as compared to psychiatric patients (35\u00b75%) (p <0\u00b7001). Significantly more psychiatric patients reported physical symptoms similar to COVID-19 (30\u00b73% vs 5\u00b75%) and poor or worse physical health (9\u00b72% vs 2\u00b78%) as compared to healthy controls (p<0\u00b7001). For psychiatric patients, majority of the respondents had F41.8 mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (59%), followed by F41 other anxiety disorders (25%) and F32, and F33 Major depressive disorder (16%). Table 2 shows the IES-R, DASS-21 and ISI scores of the study respondents.

As a result, immunopsychiatry service should offer point-of-care test for the detection of COVID-19 and negative findings can offer reassurance to psychiatric patients. Contributing factors to worsening mental health were likely delays in delivery of psychotropic medications, lack of access to primary care or outpatient clinics, increased financial difficulty, personal concern of contracting COVID-19, long duration of staying at home as well as more impoverished living conditions due to shortage of supplies in the weeks following the outbreak.

Second, psychiatric patients were encouraged not to visit the hospital as health services were devoted to managing terminally ill patients and suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.

After the COVID-19 epidemic, mental health preparedness and anticipation of future outbreaks will lead to an increased awareness of the needs of psychiatric patients and contingency plans to be put in place. Telepsychiatry emergency services or hotline should be made available to patients with intense suicidal ideation. Improved access to telepsychiatry services, home delivery of psychotropic medications, online psychiatric first-aid resources, and infectious disease outbreak preparedness play a pivotal role in minimising the severity of psychiatric symptoms experienced by psychiatric patients. As depression and stress are associated with an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) (Lu et al., 2017) , Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Liu, Ho, & Mak, 2012) , Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Osimo et al., 2020) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Ng et al., 2018) , future immunopsychiatry service and research should monitor the relationship between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and depression in psychiatric patients during the pandemic. Similarly, PTSD is associated with enhanced interleukin-6 response to mental stress (Lima et al., 2019) . If pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be increased in psychiatric patients during lockdown, further research is required to evaluate pharmacological intervention (Y. and nonpharmacological intervention (e.g. physical activity) to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (Simpson & Katsanis, 2020) .",

Previous studies have shown widespread discrimination against people with psychiatric illnesses in China.(Z. Zhang et al., 2019) In this study, respondents with psychiatric illnesses did not experience additional discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic. One possible explanation was that society held more negative views towards COVID-19 as compared to psychiatric illnesses during an outbreak of a life-threatening infection. Respondents with psychiatric illnesses did not show an increase in alcohol intake as compared to healthy control groups. This observation is different from the previous study, which reported the increase in alcohol intoxication and abuse after natural disasters (e.g., earthquake) (Tembe, Dhakal, Shrestha, Mugele, & House, 2019) . As the government implemented outing restriction during the COVID-19 epidemic for all citizens, people with and without psychiatric illnesses did not have frequent access to purchase alcohol from local supermarkets. Also, entertainment venues, bars, and restaurants were ordered to cease operation and these measures further reduce alcohol intake of psychiatric patients and healthy controls. Levels of PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were not related to educational level, age and gender, indicating that all sectors of the community were adversely affected.",
