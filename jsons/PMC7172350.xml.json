Pneumonia occurs in 50% of patients with acute tetraplegia during acute hospitalization and rehabilitation [1]. Respiratory disorders account for 28% of deaths in the first year after injury and 22% of deaths in later years [2]. In patients who survive for at least 24 hours after injury, pneumonia or influenza causes 16.5% of all deaths [3]. This contrasts with that of the general population of the United States, for which pneumonia and influenza account for only 2.5% of deaths and the two diseases in combination are the eighth leading cause of death [4]. The standardized mortality ratio, a measure that adjusts for age, sex, and race, indicates that the rate of fatal pneumonia is elevated by a factor of 37 for people with SCI; persons with complete tetraplegia die from pneumonia at a rate that is 150 times higher than a matched population without SCI [2].",

The majority have reported on the incidence of respiratory complications during acute care and rehabilitation, in settings such as the MSCIS hospitals. Rehospitalization rates and causes of death in persons with chronic SCI have also been published using data from the US MSCIS as well as from other nations. More recently, data on outpatient respiratory infections in Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with SCI have been reported. The populations included in these studies may not be representative of all persons with SCI. Most have focused on epidemiologic aspects of respiratory infections. There remains a need to conduct clinical trials of preventive measures and treatments to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory infections in this population.",

The most obvious of these dysfunctions caused by SCI is weakness of the respiratory muscles. If the neurologic level is at C5 or rostral, there may be some degree of diaphragm weakness or even complete paralysis with higher level motor-complete injuries. At lower neurologic levels, diaphragm innervation is intact, and this normally is sufficient to maintain at least 60% of the predicted vital capacity. Ventilatory failure caused by inspiratory muscle weakness can occur immediately after injury or develop over the first week after the injury. Patients who require mechanical ventilation are susceptible to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Over the first weeks to months after injury, many patients with partially intact diaphragm innervation acquire the ability to spontaneously ventilate, which is in part caused by strength recovery in the diaphragm. Approximately 7% of persons with SCI will be ventilator dependent when discharged from rehabilitation [7]. Patients with reduced inspiratory muscle strength are predisposed to microatelectasis, which may promote the development of pneumonia in atelectatic segments of the lung.",

            "text": "Severe expiratory muscle weakness is more prevalent in persons with SCI and is likely the most important factor increasing the incidence and case fatality for pneumonia. Expiratory muscle weakness, resulting in low voluntary cough peak expiratory flow, is strongly associated with unsuccessful extubation and increased in-hospital mortality in the general population [8]. Because the primary expiratory muscles, the internal intercostals and abdominals, have thoracic innervation, they will be paralyzed completely in all patients with motor-complete tetraplegia. Expiratory strength increases incrementally with each additional neurologic level and is essentially normal at the T12 neurologic level and below; therefore, patients with high-level paraplegia have a similar degree of weakness to those with low-level tetraplegia. The main consequence of expiratory muscle weakness is a reduced peak cough flow, which is ineffective for clearance of bronchial secretions. With a peak cough flow of less than 2.7 L/sec (160 L/min), there is inadequate airflow to mobilize secretions out of the bronchi and trachea [9]. To compensate for weak cough strength, aggressive multimodal respiratory therapy interventions are required for secretion mobilization [10]. Measures to promote secretion mobilization are listed in\nTable 1.",

Reduced sympathetic innervation to the lungs occurs with injuries above the mid-thoracic level. The unopposed vagal parasympathetic input in patients with tetraplegia leads to bronchoconstriction and increased bronchial mucus secretion [11]. In patients with acute tetraplegia, bronchial mucus production may exceed 1 L per day, and the secretions are often tenacious, likely because of an altered macromolecular composition [12]. Aspiration is relatively common in patients with acute tetraplegia, especially those with predisposing factors such as mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, anterior neck surgery, or brain injury [13]. Autonomically mediated dynamic dysfunction of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter may be an additional contributing factor [14]. In patients with chronic SCI, normal bacterial flora is altered for a number of reasons, including frequent treatment with antibiotics, autonomically mediated changes to the skin, or residence in health care settings, resulting in increased colonization with gram-negative and antibiotic-resistant organisms.",

The Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (Pneumonia PORT) derived an algorithm for determining whether adults with CAP should be hospitalized or treated in the community, based on short-term mortality risk [22]. Patients are stratified into five severity classes, and outpatient treatment is generally recommended for the two lowest risk classes. To qualify for the lowest risk class, an adult would be age 50 years or less, have none of the important comorbidities (cancer, liver disease, congestive heart failure, renal disease, or cerebrovascular disease), have normal mental status, and have normal or only mildly abnormal vital signs. Patients in the two lowest risk categories are anticipated to have a short-term mortality risk of 0.5% or less. The rule is not meant to supersede clinical judgment, nor does it take into account other reasons for hospitalization besides the predicted risk of death from pneumonia. These could include the risk for other adverse events, the availability of support at home, and the likelihood of adherence to therapy and follow-up recommendations.",

The spectrum of pathogens is similar for elderly residents of long-term care facilities who have HCAP. The sources of the multidrug-resistant pathogens include health care devices (especially respiratory care equipment), other fomites in the hospital environment, and other patients, and the pathogens are transferred to the patient during routine care. Bacteria may then reach the lower respiratory tract through gross or microscopic aspiration, inhalation, or direct inoculation by respiratory care equipment.",

Their occurrence is closely associated with both acute care length of stay and hospitalization cost for persons with new tetraplegia, and they are a more important determinant of cost than is the injury level [41]. Most published findings on pneumonia in persons with SCI come from patients undergoing acute care and initial rehabilitation at MSCIS hospitals. Jackson and Groomes [42] found a 31.4% rate of pneumonia during acute care and rehabilitation. Fishburn and colleagues [1] reported a combined rate of 50% for pneumonia or atelectasis during the first month after injury, with a 74% rate in patients with high-level tetraplegia. While receiving inpatient rehabilitation after acute care, 21.6% of patients with complete tetraplegia will have atelectasis or pneumonia [43]. Of note, 80% of pneumonias that develop soon after injury are left sided [1]. This has been attributed to difficulty with clearing secretions from the left bronchial tree using tracheal suctioning because of the more acute takeoff angle of the left mainstem bronchus.",
