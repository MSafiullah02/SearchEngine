Among the Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, and South Indian populations, HLA-B*1502 correlates with increased risk for SJS/TEN induced by aromatic antiepileptic agents such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin.

EM is a self-limited disorder. With only minor epidermal denudation, often 1-2 % BSA involvement (<10 %), EM preferentially involves the distal extremities in a symmetric distribution. EM exhibits characteristic \"target\" lesions with three zones: (1) an outer erythematous zone; (2) an edematous paler zone; and (3) a dark, dusky center. \"Atypical\" target lesions feature illdefi ned margins and/or two zones in contrast to the three of classical targets. Mucosal involvement is minimal in the EM minor and occurs in 5-60 % of EM major patients. In contrast, mucosal involvement is seen in 92-100 % of SJS and nearly 100 % of TEN patients. Moreover, EM confers minimal to no systemic symptoms. Differentiation of EM from SJS and TEN is based predominately on clinical features, particularly lesion distribution and the presence of classical target lesions. Classical target lesions must be present for a diagnosis of EM, whereas the diagnoses of SJS/TEN are to be considered for atypical targets. Histological features of EM resemble those of SJS/TEN and are therefore of limited discriminative utility.",

At this time, the skin demonstrates a \"wet cigarette paper\" appearance ( Fig. 24 .2 ). Friction or pressure easily detaches the epidermis, exposing an erythematous, often bleeding or \"scalded\" dermis. In this second phase, large tracts of epidermal denudation develop. With epidermal cleavage, blisters arise as fl uid fi lls the space between the dermis and epidermis. These fl accid, easily-ruptured blisters may be extended laterally by pressure of the thumb, a feature known as a positive Asboe-Hansen sign.

A larger, retrospective analysis conducted in the RegiSCAR cohort confi rmed this lack of survival benefi t, albeit at a lower IVIG dose.
