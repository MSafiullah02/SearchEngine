After 5 days, he presented coryza, asthenia, myalgia, dry cough, unverified fever and mild dyspnea. His 67-year-old wife (patient 2), who also accompanied him on the trip, developed the same symptoms the next day. Two days after the onset of patient 1 symptoms, the condition worsened and the patients went to the Emergency Room. Upon examination, he was afebrile, with severe dyspnea, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 90%, normotensive, acyanotic. She was afebrile, eupneic, with 95% oxygen saturation, normotensive, acyanotic. Both patients did not present significant changes in laboratory tests.",
