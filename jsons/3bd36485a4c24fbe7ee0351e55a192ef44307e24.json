MCPyV is strongly suspected to be oncogenic because its DNA has been found to be integrated within the genome of Merkel cell carcinoma (23) . MCPyV has also been detected in patients with small cell lung cancer (24, 25) and in squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma of the skin (26, 27) . However, little is known about the oncogenicity of KIPyV and WUPyV (28, 29) . In this study, we examined the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV in pediatric patients with RTIs to obtain epidemiological data for Japan. In addition, we investigated the prevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV in Japanese normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma tissues to evaluate the c 2011 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd (30) . The elution volume of the extractions was 90 \u03bcL. Thirty fresh sample pairs of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent non-cancerous normal lung tissue were obtained from surgical material at the University of Toyama Hospital in 2002, with the informed consent of the patients. These patients included 20 men and 10 women aged from 45 to 77 years, with an average age of 61.7 years. None of the patients from whom samples were obtained for this study had immunodeficiency diseases. The tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until used for DNA extrac- and 100 nmol/L of a probe. Amplification was performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with the following instrument settings: 50 \u2022 C for 2 min, 95 \u2022 C for 10 min and then 50 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and 60 \u2022 C for 1 min. The plasmids pKIPyV-real and pWUPyV-real containing the PCR products of the qualitative PCR in the vector pT7Blue (Novagene, Madison, WI, USA) were used as positive controls and for standard curves. All real-time PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and the results analyzed using ABI Prism 7000 SDS software. Viral loads were calculated from the CT values of individual samples with respect to the standard curve. The minimum concentrations of KIPyV and WUPyV genomes that would allow reproducible quantification were 10 copies per reaction. These correspond to 2 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg (lung tissues and tumors) and 2 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL (NPSs). As an internal control, \u03b2-actin was also amplified using TaqMan \u03b2 actin detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Nested PCR for KIPyV and PCR for WUPyV were also performed for lung tissue samples and NPSs as described previously (4, 5) . All specimens that were positive for KIPyV and WUPyV were also assayed for the presence of twelve other respiratory viruses: hRSV, hMPV, HRV, HBoV, PIV 1-3, influenza A and B viruses, HEV, HCoV, and adenoviruses. The PCR and RT-PCR protocols used for detecting these twelve viruses were the same as those previously described (33, 34) . The KIPyV genome was detected in 7 of the 232 NPSs (3.0%) ( Table 3) , consistent with previously reported detection rates (0.5 to 5%) (28) . The median viral load of all KIPyV-positive NPSs was 1.8 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, and the maximum value 4.1 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL.
