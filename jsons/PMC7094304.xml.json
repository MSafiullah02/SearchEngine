They include influenza virus, SARS virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, foot and mouth decease and many others (French et al., 2002, Sergeev et al., 2013). First periodicals characterizing viral capability to survive in airborne form appeared in 1960s (Harper, 1961, Harper, 1963, Hemmes et al., 1960, Hemmes et al., 1962, Hood, 1963), where the authors reported very interesting outcomes on airborne virus behaviour and transmission efficiency. A comprehensive study on survival of various strains of airborne influenza virus was recently reported by Pyankov, Pyankova, and Agranovski (2012) showing presence of virulent virus even 90 min after aerosolization.",

These outbreaks ignited strong research interest towards identification of virus transmission routs (Atkinson and Wein, 2008, Tellier, 2006, Spekreijse et al., 2011), exposure effects (Hermann et al., 2009, Kwon and Swayne, 2010, Agranovski et al., 2010) and transmission dynamics (Lipsitch et al., 2003). Also, a number of monitoring methods and techniques has been developed to meet the demand for conventional (Hermann et al., 2006, Agranovski et al., 2001, Agranovski et al., 2002, Agranovski et al., 2004, Agranovski et al., 2005, Agranovski et al., 2008), and rapid detection of targeted pathogens in the ambient air (Agranovski et al., 2006, Pyankov et al., 2007, Usachev et al., 2013). A comprehensive review by Weber and Stilianakis (2008) was produced at that stage describing corresponding research outcomes on virus inactivation and discussing models of the virus transmission. A number of important parameters of air influencing microorganism survival and delivery have been identified including air temperature and humidity, microbial resistance to external physical and biological stresses, solar intensity and others.",

A virus containing suspension was prepared and aerosolized to the experimental aerosol chamber by a 3-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI, Inc., USA) at the flowrate of 6 L/min of HEPA-filtered compressed air over 2 min time. Then the nebulizer was switched off. The experiments were performed for two sets of parameters of the air; (1) representing common office environment (25 \u00b0C and 79% RH), and (2) climatic conditions of the Middle Eastern region where the virus was originated from (38 \u00b0C and 24% RH). To minimise gravitational aerosol settlement during experiments, our previously developed rotational aerosol chamber (RAC) (Pyankov et al., 2012) was used in this project. It consists of a drum secured on a stationary axis with air-sealed ball bearings. The design of the axis enables to host pipelines used for aerosol charging and monitoring. The RAC was placed in the biosafety compartment to eliminate contamination of the laboratory air with viruses. The second reason to use the compartment was based on a fact that, as required by the experimental program, the virus survival ought to be investigated at elevated temperatures representing Middle Eastern climatic conditions \u2013 place of origin and maximum spread of the investigated microorganism. To achieve constant elevated temperature in the RAC over the entire experimental runs, the air in the compartment was heated up to a required value and then used to make up air drawn from the chamber by the samplers, as well as insulating the RAC from colder ambient air in the laboratory minimizing temperature fluctuations inside the RAC. The constant air humidity was achieved by adding required amount of steam to the compartment by the air humidifier (Model 7146, Air-O-Swiss, Switzerland). The air temperature and relative humidity were monitored in the RAC with the accuracy of \u00b10.5 \u00b0C and \u00b12% respectively over the entire experimental procedure. The particle concentration and size distribution inside the chamber were monitored by optical particle counter (Model 4705, Aeronanotech, Moscow, Russia) with 5 min increments over the entire runs.",

However, taking into account very steady time-related RT-PCR results reflecting not significant reduction of airborne virus presence in the air, one could conclude that the particle concentration decrease is minimal and the reason for such visual effect is based on intensive particle evaporation with corresponding diameter decrease below 0.3 \u00b5m, which makes aerosol invisible for the optical counter.
