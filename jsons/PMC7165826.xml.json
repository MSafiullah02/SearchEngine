            "text": "Geographically, Slovenia is a Central\u2010European country situated between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia. In its entirety, different species of wildlife can be found and biodiversity in this area is very high (Mr\u0161i\u0107, 1997). The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most important big\u2010game species in Slovenia with a hunting bag of around 6000 pigs per year. The population density of wild boars in Slovenia has increased drastically during the last decade despite hunting. Wild boars are present all over the country; however, the highest densities are situated in the southwest part of the country. As in Slovenia, wild boar population has increased both in number and density across Europe (Artois et al., 2002). In the last decade, evidences accumulated show that in some situations wild boars can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs (Elbers et al., 2000; Laddomada, 2000; Al Dahouk, et al., 2005) and movement of these animals can potentially result in dissemination of these diseases. Currently there is no recorded data regarding prevalence and distribution of the most important infectious agents among wild boars in Slovenia. Therefore, our objective was to determine the seroprevalence against selected infectious pathogens in wild boars from Slovenia.",

            "text": "Aujeszky's disease is an economically important disease of pigs, for which several European countries (Elbers et al., 2000; M\u00fcller et al., 2003, 2005; Martini et al., 2003) and the USA (Hahn et al., 1997; Corn et al., 2004) have implemented national program for elimination of the disease. The prevalence of antibodies against ADV found in the present study (31%) is higher than that reported from Eastern (8.9%) and Western (9.9%) Germany (M\u00fcller et al., 1998; Lutz et al., 2003), France (5.5%) (Albina et al., 2000), Italy (30%) (Capua et al., 1997) and lower than that reported from south\u2010central part of Spain (56%) (Gortazar et al., 2002), Croatia (54%) (\u017dupan\u010di\u0107 et al., 2002), Tunisia (54%) (Jridi et al., 1996) and Corsica with prevalence up to 61% (Albina et al., 2000). Prevalence of AVD antibodies in wild boars from the southern part of the USA was found to be 29% (Nettles and Erickson, 1984), 35% (Van Der Leek et al., 1993), 38% (Corn et al., 2004) and 61% (Gresham et al., 2002). Hahn et al. (1997) estimated that the potential source for reinfection in the USA is the large population of wild boars where prevalence of ADV is variable but can be exceeded by up to 60% as was estimated later in South Carolina (Gresham et al., 2002). The relatively high prevalence of antibodies against ADV in wild boars in Slovenia is surprising because our domestic pig population is free of AD. In the last two decades, there was only one outbreak of AD in 1996 in a very limited area where the disease was eradicated by slaughtering of all seropositive pigs (Valen\u010dak, 2002).",

PRCV does not appear to be an important primary pathogen but it has considerably complicated the diagnosis of TGE, particularly by serological means.

Disease control among wild boar population in Texas (USA) using faecal specimens revealed no positive cases (Corn et al., 1986). S. cholerasuis was revealed by bacteriological examination in juvenile wild boars in Germany causing haematogenous osteomyelitis (M\u00fcller et al., 2004). S. cholerasuis was also the cause of disease and death of farmed wild boars in Spain (Perez et al., 1999). In Japan, Salmonella spp. was isolated from two wild boars meat samples (Kanai et al., 1997). Salmonella spp. is presented in domestic swine as well as in wild boar population (Perez et al., 1999; Vicente et al., 2002) and could, as a zoonotic agent, play an important role in transmission to humans via infected carcases and pork product. Seroprevalence of Salmonella spp. in domestic pigs in Slovenia is low. Established seroprevalence in fatteners ranged between 6 and 25% (\u0160tukelj and Valen\u010dak, 2004).",
