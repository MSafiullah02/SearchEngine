Individuals with acute infectious or carrier state of defined blood-borne viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E, HIV, HTLV, etc.) should not participate in invasive treatment. The same applies to carriers of group A streptococcal infection, MRSA, VRE and other multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRO). See chapter \u201cInfection Control for Health Professionals\u201d.Tracing of infections among personnel. In case of MRSA infection transmitted to a patient, exposed personnel should be tested (see MRSA procedures). If there are two or more SSIs with group A streptococci, the operating team and other personnel present during the operations are tested for carrier status [16]. After infection from patient to personnel, it may be appropriate to test those who have been in contact with the patient [17].",

In this area, only clean green clothes (or selected colour) and clean socks, shoes and caps are put on before entering. Private clothes or shoes increase the burden of particles and microbes in the environment and are not allowed. Follow the routines and change to clean scrub suits every day and after visiting other departments, after taking part in a contagious operation and after contamination of the scrub suit. No green clothes outside the operation department! Exceptions are urgent activity or transfer of the operated patient to postoperative/intensive departments. During transfer, change shoes and use a clean white gown (changed after each shift or more often) over the scrub suit, and immediately return to the operation department. After working in scrub suit outside the department, change to a new green scrub suit upon return.Surgical masks for everyone in the operating room. The coloured side should be out, white side in. Bend the clamp to fit it over the nose. Tie up on the head outside the cap and down the neck. Take off the mask by first opening it in the neck and then on the head to avoid that it falls down the chest. Do not reuse the mask!Respiratory protection (filtering half masks) without exhalation valve\u2014P3 mask\u2014is used for operations with suspected airborne infection (see \u201cisolation regimes\u201d and \u201crespirators\u201d). Learn to take on and off the respirator.Visor/goggles are used during surgery where one knows there is a risk of splashing. Blood-borne virus may penetrate normal eye mucosa.Sterile surgical gown should be used by all working in the surgical area and/or with sterile instruments. During operations with larger amounts of blood/body fluids, the gown should have fluid-tight front and sleeves.Sterile gloves should cover well the cuff of the operating gown.

Surgical personnel in scrub suits serve the patients. There is no access or transit traffic for other personnel.Sluice systems for patients and staff.Patient sluice for bed, stretcher and 2\u20133 persons (from 16 to 18 m2) for any pretreatment of the patient. Wash the basin and waste bin, but not the storage space.Staff sluice with space adapted to the number of employees, visitors, students, etc. (1\u20132 m2 per person). Ample wardroom for dressing and with separate closets for private clothes, toilet, shower, cloth racks for used laundry and sink. From the wardrobe walk through a smaller sluice where cap and shoes (preferably washable) are put on, and hand hygiene is done before entering the department.A separate textile storage room for green cloths (scrub suits, etc.) in connection to the wardrobe.Storage rooms for operation tops (operating table) and one separate storage for clean cover material on the top. Cover the operation top with single-use plastic after cleaning and preparing for the next patient.Washing room for operation tops: unclean and clean sides with separate exhaust air and sluice to avoid the spread of aerosols into the operation corridor.Shoe washing machine for washing and drying, unclean and clean sides with separate exhaust air and sluice to avoid the spread of aerosols into the operation corridor.Surgical hand disinfection room: 3\u20136 m2 depending on the staff number, with shielded basin area to avoid splashes. Written guidance, only current disinfectants and soaps and clock are on the wall. No storage space due to aerosols - and no other functions. See Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-99921-0_34, surgical hand disinfection.Anaesthesia induction room with ample space for patient bed and 2\u20133 people (ca. 16 m2). Wash basin and cabinets for clean equipment used in connection with induction.Operating theatre: good space for a minimum of five to eight people, patient and equipment. Necessary area is 40\u201360 m2. Storage of equipment in the theatre is not recommended. If still extra equipment is needed to be stored, place it in tight, clean boxes, cleaned outside between operations. Coordinating staff assisting the operation team must have at least 2 m distance from the patient and sterile equipment, in all directions. Walls, floors and ceilings should be complete and well maintained, and the surfaces must withstand strong disinfectants. There should be zero tolerance for wires and hoses on the floor.Storage rooms and hygienic requirements for storage of sterile equipment. Clean/sterile equipment should be cleaned on the outside of the packages and stored in cabinets with glass doors to protect against dust. Storage rooms for sterile equipment should not be used as office, meeting room, storage room for unclean items, etc.Sterile storage room: plenty of space (16\u201320 m2), dependent on activity, easy to clean, and a wash basin/dispenser for hand disinfection in close proximity\u2014outside the door. Cabinets with glass doors. Cleaned daily and the surface of the benches is disinfected. Limited access due to burden of microbes and particles in the air. See \u201cGuidelines for Storing Clean and Sterile Equipment\u201d.Sterile storage room for anaesthesia: 14\u201318 m2, follow the guidelines described above.Sterile fluid storage room should be in a separate compartment: 4\u20136 m2, follow the guidelines described above.Storage for clean equipment, couch equipment (to place and adjust the patient on the operation table), etc. is surveyable, 16\u201320 m2 and easy to clean, and the floor should only be used as storage space for equipment to be run on wheels/pulleys. Cabinets with glass doors to protect against dust. Couch equipment must undergo thorough disinfection after each use and must be stored clean or may be disposable.Storage of \u201cclean-unclean\u201d equipment. A designated storage room (16\u201320 m2) for equipment and machines containing water, like water heater equipment, that cannot be disinfected satisfactorily after use. This equipment is constantly exposed to the growth of bacteria in the inner parts. If the cleaning process is unsatisfactory, it should be washed and disinfected thoroughly outside and stored separately. Connectors to the machines should be considered as potential sources of infection for gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria.Storage of mechanical equipment (CPAP, ventilators etc) with internal technical/electric parts that are air-cooled by drawing air from the room, should be evaluated for special handling and storage since the contamination of inner parts may be a risk for patients.Storage for plaster and equipment for plastering should be a separate, clean and dry room, not stored with other equipment. Plaster is a good growth material for microbes, and it is mostly not sterile. Plaster should be placed in clean, dry cabinets with glass doors to protect against dust and microbes.Disinfection room (16\u201320 m2) is divided into a clean and unclean side. This room is a \u201cwet room\u201d that should have negative air pressure towards corridors and operating rooms. The decontaminator and instrument washing machine, etc. should be checked daily for temperature and logged at regular intervals. The floor should not be used as storage space and should be easy to clean.A well-designed disinfection room for anaesthesia equipment (16 m2) is needed.Sterilization central for disinfecting, controlling, packing, sterilizing and storing of sterile items is often placed nearby or in connection with the operation department, with a separate sluice for changing clothes. The central may also be outside the operating area, with a clean and direct transport path (elevator, trolleys, etc.) to the operation department. A separate room for washing and drying of the transport trolleys between each use is needed.Inspection/disinfection. All disinfected and cleaned equipment, ultrasonic bath, instrument washing machine, etc. are checked during the process. A workplace and place for necessary equipment require approximately 10 m2.Packing room\u2014packing of clean equipment to be sterilized. This clean room area is dependent on the operative activity of the hospital and the number of employees. The room should be at least 16 m2 and 7\u201310 m2 per workplace. Positive air pressure with filtered air in, as well as more than 15 air changes per hour.Autoclave room\u2014sterilization room with a sluice system. The area is dependent on the number of autoclaves, sizes and types. Through-fare autoclave is an advantage with one unclean input side and one clean side for out take. A separate steam exhaust ventilation and negative air pressure on the unclean side are needed. The central should be shielded from noise, heat and steam from this unit to avoid humidity on prepared sterile instrument packs. A regular control of autoclave and other sterilization machines is needed.Storage for sterile equipment. The same quality as on sterile stock in the operation department.Unpacking of goods that have outer packaging is done in a separate room with a sluice to the sterile central. The room should have a negative air pressure and exhaust ventilation.Other storage needs are determined by the sterile and operation department\u2019s activities.Other rooms are waste disposal room (12\u201316 m2, with negative air pressure and wash basin); textile room; toilet and shower (minimum one per ten employees); dining, rest and meeting rooms; and general office.",

There are specific requirements concerning colony-forming units (CFU) per m3 of air [6, 11\u201313, 18\u201323]. All equipment brought into this room should be clean and have a low bacterial burden. See also chapter \u201cPrevention of Postoperative Wound Infections, Point D\u201d.Uncontrolled air currents may occur from sudden and large movements in the room and increase the risk of bringing particles and microbes from the staff and environment to the sterile area and to the surgical site. Traffic in and out of the operating room creates uncontrollable air currents [3, 4, 12, 13, 18\u201323].Tranquillity and close the doors before the start of surgery for to settle airborne bacteria-carrying particles.Persons present in the operating room have an impact on the number of bacteria-carrying particles in the air [12]. Ideally, no more than eight persons should be present in a regular operating room. Local routines should be followed.Clothing reduces bacteria release from the skin into the air. Covering all the skin and using dense textiles reduce the release of skin cells, particles and bacteria even more.Instruments should be covered immediately after laying\u2014until use. Check air currents. Avoid contamination of sterile instruments from persons that unaware come into the airflow that goes towards the instrument tables.Ventilation is 15\u201325 air changes/h. CO2 level is <1000 ppm. Fresh air supply (filtered air) is minimum of 15 L/s/person + 2 L/s/m2 surface in the operating room.Positive air pressure in operating rooms and sterile storage rooms in relation to the rest of the department.Sterile storage room is 10\u201317 air changes/h.Humidity is 35\u201340% in operating rooms. High moisture may increase bacterial growth, however weighted against a comfortable working environment. Humidity is 35\u201360% in sterile store rooms.Temperature is 18\u201325 \u00b0C. Higher temperatures can increase the growth of bacteria/release from the skin. Do not use fancoil or refrigerators. Condensation and dust collection lead to growth of bacteria and fungi in the exhaust air.LAF ceiling should be regularly checked by special procedures.",

Air is fed quickly through a calibrated system, and bacteria are deposited directly on a growth medium. This is incubated in a culture system for 2\u20137 days, and the number of colony-forming bacteria is counted. Fungi are also noted. The presence of fungi in clean rooms is not in accordance with clean room work. (See chapter \u201cPrevention of Postoperative Wound Infections\u201d, point D for the performance of CFU control.) Measurements show that most bacteria in the air come from persons present in these clean rooms.Airborne infection-ventilation system. Patients with airborne infections should be treated in the operation department, if needed. This may be done without transmission of contaminated airborne dust particles, aerosols or droplets to other parts of the department and ventilation ducts [6, 11]. The ventilation ducts of the actual operating room should be closed (and taped over) towards adjacent rooms and exhaust ducts (if the ducts are common with other operating rooms) [6, 11]. A negative air pressure (\u221225 Pa) can be established in the operating room and also later on used for airborne infections in the event of risk of aerosols, particles or droplets of infectious material. Negative pressure condition must be kept constant. \u201cReversible\u201d pressure ratio rooms, used both as positive-pressure and negative-pressure room, can create uncertainty with regard to contamination within air ducts and filters, if not followed up [24, 25].

The glove may work like a pacifier by dragging off most of the blood and tissues. A glove may reduce blood volume transferred with 52%. Gloves protect also the patient\u2019s tissue from the surgeon\u2019s skin flora and blood. Stick injuries are underreported.In England, 42 surgeons had 840 needlestick injuries during 2 years, hence 126 with bleeding [77]. Only one of four surgeons used double gloves, and when blood-borne viruses are known, only 50% used double gloves. Senior surgeons had more stick injuries and reported less frequently than junior surgeons [77].In Scotland, 1.4% of operating surgeons were infected with hepatitis C in 1999.Magnetic flat instrument deposition reduces puncture injuries by delivery of instruments [78].All types of blood contamination agents can be transmitted by needlestick injury\u2014both ways. By aerosol, blood-borne viruses can be transferred through the conjunctiva [61].The use of bipolar diathermy increases air contamination of blood and tissue more than monopolar diathermy [61].Dentist, surgery and autopsy rooms have been examined for blood aerosols [79]. The rooms are all the same with regard to air samples; 38.6% were positive for blood, i.e. a mean of 0.10 \u03bcg of Hb per m3 of air [79]. There are many samples of blood-borne infections among the operating team during surgery [80].Diathermy needles can be highly contaminated with protein that should be removed between operations [81].",
