In patients who have previously received high doses of immunosuppression or chemotherapy or in those with recurrent viral (e.g. herpes) or bacterial infections, it is important to check immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte subsets. It is worth noting that immunosuppression post-transplant reduces seroconversion rates to around 50 % of that achieved by control patients, and the evidence suggests that a second dose of vaccine such as H1N1 offers no benefit [1]. Nonetheless, it is clear that vaccination has benefit, saves lives and should be built into any transplant programme [2]. Whenever possible vaccinations should be undertaken predialysis; in particular live or attenuated vaccines must be given before immunosuppression as cannot be given post-transplant.\n",

Oral and oesophageal candidiasis is also common at this stage especially in patients on steroids. Of the herpes viruses, primary HSV is unusual in presenting at this early stage. Other viruses such as transmitted WNV can also present at this time.4\u201326 weeks: this is the period dominated by opportunistic infections related to the heaviest period of immunosuppression. Most herpes viruses (reactivation and primary infection), e.g. CMV (in the absence of prophylaxis typically at 40 days), EBV, HSV, VZV (shingles) and HHV-8/7/6. Respiratory viruses may present with chest involvement. Invasive fungal infections such as candida or aspergillus tend to present in this period as may mycobacterium TB. Parasitic infections such as reactivation of strongyloides or toxoplasmosis tend to occur early. UTIs remain very common and, in the absence of prophylaxis, PCP presents in this period.>26 weeks: periodic viral reactivation of HSV or VZV (shingles) can occur at any stage, and a small proportion of patients develop very high levels of EBV viraemia often many years post-transplant. Viral warts are also common in the first year. Late-onset CMV presents usually within the 8 weeks following cessation of prophylaxis (orogenital HSV may also recur). Incidental infections such as listeria, legionella and respiratory viral infection can occur at any time. CMV-, EBV-, VZV- and HSV-negative patients can acquire primary infection many years post-transplant particularly if they have a young family or become exposed to young children. MTB tends to present relatively early in the course of a transplant, while Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) tends to present later. Cryptococcus tends to present late and PCP can occur at any stage, although risk diminishes with time. NB: hepatitis B and C reactivation can occur at any time especially after cessation of prophylaxis in hepatitis B and can be promoted by the use of steroids.\n",

For example, TNF-alpha released by rejection or infection can activate the major immediate early promoter (MieP) of CMV and induce intracellular replication. Transplant recipients (and occasionally, it is worth remembering, patients immunosuppressed for autoimmune conditions) can have a primary infection (D+/R\u2212), reinfection (with a different strain) (D+/R+) or reactivation (D\u2212/R+).",

This means that a CMV na\u00efve patient can go from asymptomatic with a low detectable viral load to significant end-organ disease within a week. A patient with primary infection often presents with the so-called CMV syndrome (high fever without localising physical signs) that can progress rapidly to gastritis, colitis (often bloody), pneumonitis and other end-organ involvement. This is usually associated with very high viral loads. Patients with reactivation or reinfection may have a less fulminant course with isolated colitis or pneumonitis without an obvious full-blown viral syndrome. Either way, end-organ damage can progress rapidly and can occur with only low-level viraemia or very rarely in the absence of viraemia; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required.

Pneumonitis may present with shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation post-exercise and may progress swiftly from mild dyspnoea to marked desaturation particularly after mild exertion. Chest X-ray (see Fig. 71.1) or CT scan may show signs of an interstitial lung disease, but there is a wide differential so it is essential to get samples, rapidly, (ideally a bronchoalveolar lavage) where possible or treat blindly (covering CMV) or both. It is important to note that CMV infection predisposes to other infections, and viral pneumonitis can coexist with Pneumocystis pneumonitis. Meningitis and encephalitis may present with classic symptoms and signs, or epilepsy and impaired cognition. It can be diagnosed from PCR on CSF, so ensuring the appropriate sample is taken at the time of lumbar puncture is important. Where possible, with tissue-invasive disease such as gastritis, colitis (Fig. 71.2) and nephritis (Fig. 71.3), biopsy, culture and PCR are critical. However, the pancreas and retina are less-appealing biopsy targets: ophthalmologists can normally make a firm clinical diagnosis, and CMV pancreatitis is usually, therefore, a presumptive diagnosis based on viraemia and clinical findings.\n\n\n\n",

For instance, studies showing an association with acute cellular rejection have not always differentiated cause of effect, and a significant proportion (80 % in our experience) of acute rejection precedes CMV viraemia, so much of this association may simply be a response to increased immunosuppression. CMV viraemia is immunomodulatory and predisposes to EBV and HHV-6 viraemia, as well as an increase in fungal infections, although again CMV viraemia may also be a biomarker of over immunosuppression. Some studies have shown increased mortality, and worse 4-year graft survival has also been shown [8]; however, a UK study based on serology in 10,000 transplants showed no effect on patient or allograft survival [9].

For kidney transplantation most guidelines favour universal prophylaxis (for D+/R\u2212 or any positive recipients), especially following depleting antibodies. This is, in part based on meta-analyses of prophylaxis studies demonstrating a benefit in all cause mortality with prophylaxis [13]. Most of the studies in the meta-analyses have short follow-up and very few patients in the pre-emptive arm. Guidelines mostly acknowledge that pre-emptive therapy is probably equally appropriate if the logistics can be robustly managed (the case for pre-emptive over prophylaxis is eloquently argued by Thomas Reischig [14]) and there is some suggestion that the prevailing opinion is moving towards equal recommendation for pre-emptive and prophylaxis.",

Based on the findings of the IMPACT study [15] which showed a reduced rate of late-onset CMV disease with 200 compared to 100 days treatment (16 % vs. 37 %), the guidelines tend to favour treatment for 200 days in D+/R\u2212 and in those who have received depleting antibodies such as ATG. The dose recommended for those with normal renal function is 900 mg per day, but 450 mg appears to be as effective, causes much less leucopenia but potentially increases the risk of resistance [16]. Further dose reduction for renal impairment is required. The risk of CMV disease in D\u2212/R\u2212 is so low as to not require CMV prophylaxis but does therefore mandate anti-HSV prophylaxis. Clinicians need to be vigilant to CMV post-prophylaxis and have a system of monitoring patients at this time as well as being alert to the possibility of viral resistance or non-compliance during prophylaxis.",

It immortalises B-cell lines and remains mostly latent with occasional lytic cycles and shedding mostly in saliva in healthy individuals. Given the prevalence of EBV infection, primary infection following transplantation is common in a seronegative recipient. Viraemia is common post-transplant occurring in roughly 50 % of all patients, but this is usually asymptomatic. Occasionally patients may present with IM or non-specific viral illness, but the greatest concern is the propensity for EBV to induce post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Ninety percent of early PTLDs are EBV positive, and a primary infection post-transplant confers a 10\u201375-fold risk of PTLD (greater still if concomitant CMV infection and/or the use of depleting antibodies). There is also data to support EBV viraemia preceding development of PTLD; however, recent guidelines make the reasonable point that there is no evidence to support the routine monitoring of EBV levels post-renal transplant [19].",

Consequently the KDIGO guidelines recommend screening plasma for BKV DNA, monthly for 3 months, followed by 3 monthly for 12\u201324 months [4]. An alternative to plasma DNA is to use urine cytology (Papanicolaou stain) to identify the viral cytopathic effect in \u2018decoy cells\u2019 (detached tubular epithelial cells with viral nuclear inclusions). This has a lower positive predictive value than viraemia (similar to DNA screening of urine) but is cheaper than nucleic acid testing [27]. Urine positive for viral cytopathic effect should prompt plasma BKV DNA screening. Plasma BKV DNA screening should also be done in the context of an unexplained rise in creatinine or ureteric obstruction. Not everyone with viraemia develops PVAN so the gold standard for diagnosis is histological evidence of polyoma virus with viral cytopathic changes, nuclear inclusion, interstitial infiltrate and tubulitis. Granulomas may also be present (Fig. 71.5). It is confirmed by positive simian virus large T-antigen staining (SV40). However, the infection is patchy and the disease may be missed early on especially if the biopsy is small or superficial. In addition, initial views of the biopsy may appear identical to the tubulitis of acute cellular rejection so all biopsies with a cellular infiltrate should be stained for SV40 with urgency to avoid increasing IS when reduction is necessary.\n",

The use of leflunomide is out of the comfort zone for most nephrologists; drug monitoring is not available to most units and judging the appropriate dose is therefore tricky. Cidofovir has very considerable nephrotoxicity, pre-hydration with IV fluids is necessary, and the subsequent deterioration in renal function causes further diagnostic difficulty. There is a little evidence that fluoroquinolones reduce viraemia, but no evidence currently of improved clinical outcomes. Given the high prevalence of BKV infection, IVIg would seem a harmless therapeutic option, but it is a scarce resource without an evidence base, and it is not clear what significance humoral immunity has in clearing an intracellular virus. The data for conversion to mTOR inhibitors as treatment is also poor, but there is quite a lot of circumstantial evidence that mTOR inhibition may reduce the risk of PVAN by roughly a half that of other IS regimens [25] possibly by inhibiting cell cycle progression and not disabling BKV-specific T-cell responses to the same degree. In short there is a severe lack of decent evidence to support treatment of PVAN when appropriate ISR has failed. Our practice and that of some others [28] if PVAN persists following ISR or there has been a rejection episode is to introduce an mTORi (if proteinuria <0.5 g/l), ultimately aiming for mTORi monotherapy.",

A histological grading system (A\u2013C) for PVAN has been devised based on the amount of cellular involvement and the extent of interstitial fibrosis and atrophy (reviewed in 28). The take-home message is that grade A is associated with 13 % graft loss, but grade C 100 % graft loss, i.e. early detection and ISR are likely to be dramatically more helpful than applying toxic medication for advanced disease. Limited data suggests a recurrence rate of about 20 %, but loss of second graft seems rare.

Despite this, clinically apparent reactivation in the form of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is very rare in transplantation. A caveat here is that the risk of PML is clearly related to the burden of immunosuppression; cases have been reported in patients with SLE following rituximab and in transplants following belatacept as well as less-specific depleting antibodies. PML has a wide differential and may be confused with CNI toxicity. The treatment is with staged immunosuppression reduction mindful of immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) with rapid withdrawal resulting in a vigorous immune response and worsening of clinical features as a consequence. Cidofovir has been used with limited success. The issue of re-transplantation is a moot point, often PML from whatever cause is an absolute contraindication, but it might be considered once there is good evidence of immune recovery in the absence of further depleting antibodies and following counselling.",

Registry data shows a substantial excess of cervical and anal precancer (approximately \u00d710) and a 50\u2013100-fold increase in vulval premalignancies; most alarmingly the average age of vulval premalignancy in this group is 37, almost 25 years earlier than the general population.

Compared to other SOTs, RTRs are relatively spared from fungal infections but rates of 2\u201314 % have been reported, with rates in pancreas recipients much higher [45]. In a review of nearly 100 RTRs with invasive fungal infection, candida, cryptococcus and aspergillus are the three most common [46]. Fungal infections may be trivial colonisations, but all of the fungi discussed below can cause invasive disease with high mortality and early diagnosis is critical. Azoles used to treat several fungal infections have a profound inhibitory effect on cytochrome p450; consequently in the absence of close monitoring, starting an azole is highly likely to render a fungaemic patient CNI toxic.",
