Attachment to the receptor may result in down-regulation of ACE-2, causing unopposed angiotensin II activity. ACE-2 counterbalances angiotensin II by promoting anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and vasodilation. Unchecked angiotensin II could injure tissues via a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, vasoconstrictive state [7] . Tissue injury could result in endothelial dysfunction mirroring that which is seen in septic or distributive shock. The autonomic nervous system is immensely intertwined in the response to sepsis. The parasympathetic system works by an efferent inflammatory reflex to attenuate the inflammatory response. On the other hand, the adrenergic sympathetic system is pro-inflammatory via catecholamines. However, after an initial surge, stores of catecholamines can become depleted resulting in septic shock [8] .",

Propofol, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, seems to be renal-protective by attenuating ischemic reperfusion injury and reducing the incidence of AKI [13] . In sepsis, however, the use of propofol can be associated with significant post-induction hypotension. Also, cardiac inotropy and lusitropy can decrease by approximately 40% in severe sepsis and should be avoided or used cautiously in COVID-19 patients [12] .",
