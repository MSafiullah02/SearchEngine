Professor Bob Watson, chief scientific officer for the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), spoke to the press on 7 August 2008 after the publication of a two and a half year analysis by the UK Foresight programme, and said that he thought we should now plan to adapt to temperature rises of up to 4\u00b0C. Sir David King, the former chief scientific officer to the UK Government, concurred with these findings, pointing out that there is now a 20% risk that we may reach these temperatures and that if we do it may well push up over dangerous climate tipping points resulting in knock-on effects such as the release of the methane hydrate deposits in the Arctic.At 4\u00b0C we are basically into a different climate regime. I think that is a dangerous mindset to be in. Thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that it is going to cost. There is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming. It is actually pretty alarming.2\n",

The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes in non-CO2 forcing like the methane released from the melting tundra. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.",

The European Union (EU) adopted 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial global temperature as a goal to limit human-made warming and Hansen and his team had earlier argued for a limit of 1\u00b0C global warming (relative to 2000, 1.7\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial time), aiming to avoid practically irreversible ice sheet and species loss. This 1\u00b0C limit, with nominal climate sensitivity of \u00be\u00b0C per W/m2 and plausible control of other greenhouse gases, implies maximum CO2 \u223c450 ppm. Hansen\u2019s 2008 paper gives clear evidence\nof the need for even lower levels of greenhouse gases because he believes that the key question is not what temperatures we can adapt to but at what point we cross the trigger point to inevitable climate chaos.3\n",

By 2007 over 400 coastal dead zones were recorded, up from 300 in 1995 and 162 in the late 1980s. Dead zones are caused when massive algal blooms, feeding off pollutants such as fertilizers, die and decay.

The resulting \u2018hypoxic\u2019 seabeds can asphyxiate seabed organisms like clams and worms, and in turn disrupt fish stock.

The increased need for traffic-free zones in open restaurant areas of a city may become a feature of future inner city planning strategies, to ensure that local office buildings can be naturally ventilated without excessive noise levels. So noise and pollution should be increasingly included as key concerns for urban designers and local councils alike. Even fashionable buildings on sites with high noise and traffic pollution levels are problems, like the \u00a313 million Hammersmith Ark building.

The significance of a range of factors may influence how animals behave in a changing climate. Already we have the phenomenon of wild animals becoming adapted to live in cities, as was clearly outlined in David Baron\u2019s book The Beast in the Garden.30 He cites cases of bears moving into New Jersey suburbs, raccoons in Los Angeles, and in the UK the urban fox is a common occurrence. The animals are drawn to feed off rubbish bins, a particular problem in the USA where, because of urban sprawl, the suburbs are moving into what was wilderness. Animal numbers have risen owing to restrictive laws in some states on the hunting and trapping of a range of larger animals, for instance lynx, bobcats, bears, beavers, foxes, wolves and cougars. There are black bears in the suburbs of Boston for the first time in 200 years and in New Jersey they have multiplied to over an estimated 3300. In December 2003 New Jersey authorized its first bear hunt in 33 years. Coyotes are multiplying too, and their cheek was demonstrated when one ran into the federal building in Seattle, through reception and into the lift! They routinely eat cats and dogs. In Florida the alligator population is growing at an unprecedented rate, helped by people buying up large plots and embracing the wilderness life and feeding the animals. David Baron maintains that the USA (and humans in general, the most pervasive species of all) is engaged in a grand and largely unintentional experiment. The \u2018range\u2019, on which Americans were once so happy to be \u2018at home\u2019, has moved from the plains to the car park at the mall and shows no sign of withdrawing back to the plains and the mountains.31\n\n",

The mountain was closed in August 2003, with its naked slopes covered with heaps of rubble and scree. Two climbers died just trying to get to the restaurant at the start of the climbing routes. The permafrost that holds the mountain peaks together had melted to a depth of 7 feet (2.1 m), making ski lifts and cable cars unstable. The problems became apparent in July 2003, when an enormous rock avalanche hurtled down the mountain\u2019s east face, and within two hours another rocked the north face. More than 70 climbers had to be hauled from the mountain, one of the biggest mountaineering rescues in history. The mountain had actually begun to fall apart under their feet. Ice as it warms, but before it melts, may be more unstable than when it is turning to water. There is a growing realization that there is going to be a lot more of this type of devastation in mountainous regions as the foundations of the mountains, and their ski lifts and cable cars, become unstable.32\n",

One is the ability to produce more than one crop a year and expand the range of species grown. One example is the potential for the increased production of British wine. In the Campsie Hills, near Glasgow, the Cumbernauld vineyard is thriving and, banking on a good dose of global warming in the area, locals eagerly await the advent of Scottish wine made from Caledonia grapes. It was claimed in 2004 that if the Champagne region of France were to overheat and has to return to making more traditional Bordeaux types of wine, southern England could become the home of sparkling wine. The geography of wine is set to change dramatically with climate change and those who will suffer most will be the growers of southern France and Italy who may have to move their grapes to higher elevations or change their grape stock plants. In Scotland grapes such as Muller-Thurgau and Bacchus may do well, while in the southern areas Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes may thrive best in the warming climate. Vine growers will have to be very adaptable to survive what climate change is throwing at them.33\n",

The International Grains Council predicted that the industrial use of grains would rise in 2008 by 23% to 229 million tonnes, of which around 107 million tonnes would be absorbed by ethanol producers for biofuels. The price of rice rose by 50% in two weeks in May 2008, triggering food riots in many countries around the world as people began not to be able to buy basic foodstuffs. Food shortages are severely affected by extreme weather events and the extensive flooding in south China, Indonesia and the Philippines in summer 2008 heralded conditions of growing food poverty.34 Widespread droughts and flooding in Australia, Africa and America also contributed to growing food shortages. Population growth around the world is also a factor in rising food prices, as are the rising standards of living in many emerging countries.A loaf of bread in the UK rose from 53 pence in 2002 to 129 pence by summer 2008.A tonne of rice on world markets rose from $145 in 2002 to over $700 by summer 2008.\n",

What is increasingly apparent is that everyone from the lower and middle classes, in fact all but richest minority of the world\u2019s population, will have to turn their hands to growing or accessing as much of their own food locally as possible because of the growing cost of centrally provided food in the shops.

Perhaps the greatest achievement of any urban gardeners is in the Chinese Desert Oasis city of Turfan, where the main crop of the town, grapes, is also used as an air conditioning system for the whole city: all the pavements and courtyards of houses in the old city are planted with vines that keep out the sun and provide a luxurious micro-climate beneath the vines. Other strategies for gardening in deserts include the planting of only drought-tolerant species and minimizing water loss rates by very careful diurnal and seasonal strategies for planting, watering and harvesting species.37\n",
