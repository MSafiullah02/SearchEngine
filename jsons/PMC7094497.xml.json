Bivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between the dependent variable (presence of virus) and independent covariates using t tests for normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data. Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used for categorical variables as appropriate. Covariates that had a P < .1 from the bivariate analyses were entered in a mixed stepwise logistic regression model to determine which variables independently predicted viral infection. The maximum and minimum threshold significance levels for an effect to be entered and retained in the model were 0.25 and 0.1, respectively.

The best predictor of detecting a respiratory virus in these infants was the NICU provider ordering respiratory viral testing, which was performed in 6 (75%) of the 8 PCR-positive infants and was positive in only 2 infants (Tables II and III).

Only 3 infants (1, rhinovirus/enterovirus; 2, parainfluenza-3 virus) were detected by both multiplex PCR panels. This result likely is attributable to the differences in both the composition of their multiplex primer targets for different viruses as well as the lower limit of detection of viral particles by each assay. Our findings support the better sensitivity of GenMark for detection of coronaviruses and rhinovirus.22 The 2 infants who were positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus by Luminex xTag testing but negative by the GenMark eSensor panel could have been infected with enterovirus rather than rhinovirus because enterovirus is not detected by the GenMark eSensor kit. Unfortunately, viral culture or specific enteroviral PCR testing was not performed in either infant.",

Viruses detected in the 26 infants were parainfluenza virus (20 patients), human metapneumovirus (9 patients), RSV (15 patients), entero/rhinovirus (7 patients), and influenza B (4 patients). Unlike in our study, 28% of the positive swabs included more than one virus, and 14 infants had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus, with clusters observed. None of our patients who had a respiratory virus detected was sampled subsequently because they did not undergo another sepsis evaluation, but there was no clustering of positive infants in either NICU. Also different from our study was that a viral infection was not clinically recognized by the NICU providers, whereas 6 of our 8 infants who had a respiratory virus detected had been tested for clinical reasons. Importantly, however, Bennet et al1 found that infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus had longer length of hospitalization, greater use and duration of supplemental oxygen, prolonged ventilator support, twice the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and greater number of clinical deterioration events.1 In our study, the number of infants who tested positive for respiratory viruses was too small to be able to find significant associations with such variables.",

Similarly, the small sample size and the lack of real time knowledge of the results of viral testing did not allow for detection of potential differences in antibiotic use among infants with and without viral infection. Future studies that enroll a larger cohort of infants with rapid feedback of results to providers are needed to determine how respiratory viral testing can inform antibiotic stewardship in the NICU.",

On the other hand, all 8 cases represented health care\u2013associated infections that if appropriately diagnosed, could lead to optimal strategies to prevent their occurrence.

Nonetheless, the number of respiratory viral infections may have been underestimated if the clinical signs of a viral respiratory infection were confused with other events like frequent desaturation episodes or increasing oxygen requirement and not a bacterial infection that would have made the infant eligible for the study. The question also remains whether the virus was causing the clinical signs or whether it was a previously unidentified infection in which shedding was ongoing. The latter issue may require the inclusion of healthy infants in future studies of respiratory viral testing in the NICU. In addition, future studies involving microarray analysis for studying the gene expression profiles of infected infants may help to resolve this issue by differentiating infection from possible colonization.33\n",
