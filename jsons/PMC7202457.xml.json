There are biases that could influence the rates of viral detection we have observed in cases and controls. The approved method of nasal mucus specimen collection for cases may have been less successful than methods used in other studies.14 In our study, cases were sampled in an emergency department setting, where conditions of the encounter and the lesser experience of our specimen collectors may have diminished our chances of getting a good sample. In contrast, samples from controls were taken in a clinic setting by more experienced nurses with ample time. Cases were seen at a time when their likelihood of infection was greatest. Controls may have been positive at another time during the study period, which may have been undetected by us. Despite these issues, our results confirm that respiratory viral infections, particularly rhinoviruses, occur in a significant majority of children with asthma presenting to emergency departments with asthma, and show that they are present in a substantial minority of asthmatic children not requiring emergency treatment in the same period.",

Our interpretation of this finding is that it is likely that the vast majority of children returning to school encounter respiratory viruses, principally rhinoviruses, extremely frequently during this period. It is therefore not surprising that a substantial minority have detectable virus in clinical samples taken during this time. The comparable or possibly greater asthma severity in the controls suggests that disease severity per se is not a primary factor in the use of emergency departments for asthma exacerbations. However, fewer cases had asthma control medications (inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) prescribed, and hardly any used environmental control measures. The much greater reported previous rate of emergency department visits for asthma in the cases may be attributable to undertreatment as well. The controls had much less morbidity than cases, suggesting that their host response to viruses and/or their increased level of asthma control was preventing clinical illness. Similar studies investigating host responses and duration of viral carriage as well as viral loads in this context would yield further important information.",

Because we included only school-age children in our study and there were no differences in the age distribution of the groups, both cases and controls would have been equally exposed to typical school environments.",
