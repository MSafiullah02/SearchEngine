A total of 26 recipients (72%) were male, and the median age was 60 years (range, 32 to 77). Fourteen recipients (39%) were black, and 15 recipients (42%) were Hispanic. Twentyseven recipients (75%) had received a deceaseddonor kidney; 34 recipients (94%) had hypertension, 25 (69%) had diabetes mellitus, 13 (36%) had a history of smoking tobacco or were current smokers, and 6 (17%) had heart disease. Thirty-five of the patients (97%) were receiving tacrolimus, 34 (94%) were receiving prednisone, and 31 (86%) were receiving mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid.",

Eight patients who were in stable condition without major respiratory symptoms (22%) were monitored at home, and 28 patients (78%) were admitted to the hospital. Twentyseven of the hospitalized patients (96%) had radiographic findings that were consistent with viral pneumonia, and 11 (39%) received mechanical ventilation. Six patients (21%) received renal replacement therapy. At a median follow-up of 21 days (range, 14 to 28), 10 of the 36 kidneytransplant recipients (28%) and 7 of the 11 patients who were intubated (64%) had died. Two of the 8 patients who were monitored as outpatients died at home; both were recent kidney-transplant recipients who had received antithymocyte globulin within the previous 5 weeks (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Table 1 summarizes the initial laboratory results in the 28 hospitalized patients. Twenty-two (79%) were lymphopenic, 12 (43%) had thrombocytopenia, 19 (68%) had low CD3 cell counts, 20 (71%) had low CD4 cell counts, and 8 (29%) had low CD8 cell counts. Inflammatory markers were measured, and 10 patients (36%) had ferritin levels higher than 900 ng per milliliter, 13 (46%) had C-reactive protein levels higher than 5 mg per deciliter, 12 (43%) had procalcitonin levels higher than 0.2 ng per milliliter, and 16 (57%) had d-dimer levels higher than 0.5 \u03bcg per milliliter.",

Apixaban was administered to patients with d-dimer levels higher than 3.0 \u03bcg per milliliter. Six severely ill patients received the CCR5 inhibitor leronlimab (PRO 140, CytoDyn) on a compassionate-use basis, and 2 received the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. Interleukin-6 levels were very elevated (range, 83 to 8175 pg per milliliter) when leronlimab was initiated (on day 0) in the 5 patients with elevated interleukin-6 levels; these levels decreased markedly 3 days later (range, 37 to 2022 pg per milliliter) (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). However, only the 1 patient who had the lowest interleukin-6 level (at 83 pg per milliliter) remained in stable condition without intubation.",

The number of our patients with very low CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts indirectly supports the need to decrease doses of immunosuppressive agents in patients with Covid-19, especially in those who have recently received antithymocyte globulin, which decreases all T-cell subsets for many weeks. Our results show a very high early mortality among kidney-transplant recipients with Covid-19 -28% at 3 weeks as compared with ",
