Therefore, the reasons for prolonged virus shedding may be associated with complications. In a study about MERS-CoV, Hail M et al. find that diabetes was related to prolonged detection of respiratory MERS-CoV RNA.5 Moreover, Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to immune cell dysfunction, which may partly explain virus shedding. Therefore, we highlight that the SARS-CoV-2 can present persistently in the patients combined with complications like diabetes and chronic hepatitis B infection, which deserved doctors\u2019 specially attention in the treatment of COVID-19.",
