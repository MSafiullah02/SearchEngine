C57BL/6 mice have a Listeria resistant allele at the Hc locus on chromosome 2 and show reduced susceptibility to intravenous, i.v., intragastric, i.g. or intraperitoneal, i.p, challenge with Listeria when compared to susceptible Balb/c mice (Mainou-Fowler et al., 1988, Poulsen et al., 2011). Therefore, we used C57BL/6 mice to mimic the population at low risk of listeriosis, while Balb/c mice were used to mimic high-risk groups. Two Listeria antigens were selected as the focus of our study, listeriolysin O (LLO) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as they have previously been shown to elicit strong CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (Alvarez-Dominguez et al., 2008, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2015). This was important as human listeriosis is not well characterised and antigens other than LLO or GAPDH that induce cellular immunity have yet to be found (Angelakopoulos et al., 2002; CAD and RCG unpublished results).",

Hence to maximise T-cell responses against Listeria an adjuvant is needed to up-regulate presentation of antigen on MHC class I and class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Advax\u2122 is a novel polysaccharide adjuvant derived from microparticles of delta \u03b2-d-[2-1]poly(fructo-furanosyl)\u03b1-d-glucose (delta inulin) (Cooper and Petrovsky, 2011, Cooper et al., 2013, Cooper et al., 2014, Cooper et al., 2015). Advantages of Advax include the fact that it has already been shown to be well tolerated, effective and safe for human use (Gordon et al., 2012, Gordon et al., 2014), but most importantly for the current study, its demonstrated ability to induce potent CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against a wide variety of exogenous antigens including proteins from Japanese encephalitis, influenza, hepatitis B, HIV, and SARS coronavirus (Lobgis et al., 2010, Cristillo et al., 2011, Saade et al., 2013, Honda-Okubo et al., 2015). Hence, Advax adjuvant had ideal properties for use in our Listeria T-cell epitope screening programme.",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to design a simple experimental approach that predicted the minimal epitope requirements to load and prepare DC vaccine formulations able to protect against listeriosis. We focussed on the Listeria antigens LLO and GAPDH as vaccine candidates since sera from patients recovering from listeriosis recognized various peptides from these antigens (Angelakopoulos et al., 2002; CAD and RCG unpublished results). Listeriosis is characterised by low humoral but robust T cell responses (Pamer, 2004). Previously T-cell epitopes for Listeria vaccine design have been identified by peptide elution from MHC molecules of Listeria-loaded macrophages (Geginat et al., 2001, Skoberne and Geginat, 2002). Since this approach is technically challenging, predominantly only identifies high affinity epitopes and is performed using macrophages which are less efficient at antigen presentation cells than DC, it may fail to identify many other relevant and protective Listeria T-cell epitopes. There is also no consensus of whether high, medium or low affinity epitopes may represent the best vaccine candidates. Bioinformatics approaches have been used in other infectious diseases to identify T-cell epitopes to include in vaccines with great success (Yu et al., 2002, Stephenson et al., 2015). Hence we used a bioinformatics approach to screen for potential T cell epitopes in LLO and GAPDH and followed this with a modified delayed-type-hypersensitivity (DTH) test to identify T-cell epitopes with potential to provide protection against human and veterinary listeriosis. As positive controls we used five known LLO epitopes previously identified by the elution method (Geginat et al., 2001). For T-cell epitope prediction we used IEDB, a bioinformatic prediction resource Consensus tool that combines predictions from artificial neural network (ANN), SMM and Comblib for GAPDH binding predictions (Nielsen et al., 2003, Peters and Sette, 2005, Sidney et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2012). IEDB analysis predicted that good MHC class I binders showed percentile ranks < 10 and weak binders percentile ranks < 100. Similarly, good MHC class II binders showed percentile thresholds < 50, intermediate binders < 500 and low binders < 5000.",

LLO189\u2013200 and LLO190\u2013201 peptides were not predicted to bind to IAd (score > 10000) and to be weak binders to IAb (scores 85 and 75, respectively) (Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2015). All LLO epitope predictions were in agreement with the previously MHC-I and MHC-II eluted LLO epitopes (Geginat et al., 2001, Skoberne and Geginat, 2002). However, the bioinformatic analysis also predicted new MHC binding abilities for these LLO epitopes. Hence, the LLO91\u201399 epitope previously eluted from H-2Kd was predicted to be a weak binder to H-2Kb, LLO296\u2013304 epitope eluted from H-2Kb was predicted to be a weak binder to H-2Kd, LLO189\u2013201 and LLO190\u2013201 epitopes eluted from IAb were predicted to be weak binders to IAd, and LLO189\u2013200 epitope eluted from IAd was predicted to be a weak binder to IAb. Therefore, the bioinformatics analysis identified a higher number of potential binding epitopes than the elution methods. We next studied where the predicted LLO epitopes were situated within the recently reported LLO crystal structure (K\u00f6ster et al., 2014) PBDI: 4CDB (left image, Fig. 1A). LLO showed 4 domains (D1, D2, D3 and D4) that contained several \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices with D4 being the binding domain to the phagosomal membranes. Since no crystal structure from Listeria GAPDH was available, we used the Automated Comparative Protein Modelling Server SWISS-MODEL available at: (http://www.expasy-ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) to produce a theoretical 3D model (right image, Fig. 1A). LLO epitopes that bind to MHC-I were tight or wide loops (pink and green LLO sequences, respectively, Fig. 1A), while epitopes that bind to MHC-II contained \u03b1-helices (purple LLO sequence, Fig. 1A). A similar pattern was observed for GAPDH, with GAPDH1\u201322 and GAPDH1\u201315 epitopes that bind to MHC-I containing tight loops and epitopes that bind to MHC-II molecules containing two \u03b1-helices. According to this rule, we predicted that GAPDH1\u201322 and GAPDH1\u201315 epitopes containing tight loops and two \u03b1-helices that are able to simultaneous bind to H-2Kb, H-2Kd, H-2Ld, IAb and IAd might be the best candidates for a T-cell based listeriosis vaccine. Next, the LLO91\u201399 epitope containing tight loops and LLO296\u2013304 epitope with wide loops that both bind to MHC-I molecules and the LLO189\u2013201 epitope containing two complete \u03b1-helices that bind to MHC-II molecules, were identified as good vaccine candidates as they were able to bind to MHC from both mice strains. LLO189\u2013200 and LLO190\u2013201 epitopes that contained one \u03b1-helix and bind to MHC-II molecules of one mice strain exclusively were classified using this algorithm as poor vaccine candidates.",

DC vectors need to remain viable to fully activate T cells in the draining lymph nodes, a process that takes at least 24 h. Therefore, we examined the effect of the relevant LLO and GAPDH peptides on DC cytotoxicity and activation after 24 h of culture, the time required for DC loading with peptides (Pion et al., 2010, Kono et al., 2012, Vacas-Cordoba et al., 2013, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014). Cytotoxicity was examined with Trypan-blue staining and apoptosis with 7-ADD and annexin-V fluorescence (Fig. 1B and Table 1\n) using different concentrations of LLO91\u201399, LLO189\u2013201, LLO189\u2013200, LLO190\u2013201, LLO296\u2013304, GAPDH1\u201315 or GAPDH1\u201322 peptides (0\u2013500 \u03bcg/ml). None of the LLO or GAPDH peptides at doses of 50 \u03bcg/ml and below caused DC cytotoxicity, early (E-apo of Q4 region or E-apoptosis in black bars of Fig. 1B) or late apoptosis (l-apop of Q2 region or l-apoptosis in white bars of Fig. 1B). As the highest concentrations of peptides (500 \u03bcg/ml) were associated with slightly lower DC viability (Table 1), we selected 50 \u03bcg/ml as the on-going loading concentration for our DC vaccines.",

Activated DCs show a characteristic CD11c+MHC-II+CD40+CD86+ phenotype that corresponds with higher vaccine efficiency (Pion et al., 2010, Kono et al., 2012, Vacas-Cordoba et al., 2013). Peptides by themselves generally do not activate DC, although longer peptides may sometimes do so (Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014). Since LLO and GAPDH peptides differ significantly in their length, we standardised the experiment by mixing the peptides with 50 \u03bcg/ml of Advax adjuvant prior to DC loading for 24 h. Advax was included, as it has been previously shown to modulate DC activity and potently enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to Listeria antigens (Rodriguez-Del Rio et al., 2015). We also included LPS (10 ng/ml) as a classical DC activator (DC-LPS) (Kono et al., 2012, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014) as well as untreated control DC (DC-CONT). LPS induced the highest frequency of CD11c+MHC-IIhighCD40+CD86+ DC (CD11c+ DC) followed by GAPDH1\u201322 and GAPDH1\u201315 peptides. LLO91\u201399 induced intermediate numbers of CD11c+ DC. LLO296\u2013304 and LLO189\u2013201 peptides also induced significant numbers of CD11c+ DC while LLO189\u2013200 and LLO190\u2013201 induced no CD11c+ DC at all (Fig. 1C).",

Notably, the GAPDH1\u201315 epitope that induced a high DC activation (Fig. 1C) had four MHC-I binding sequences in tight loops and one MHC-II binding sequence containing two \u03b1-helices (Fig. 1A). Intermediate DC activation occurred with the LLO91\u201399 epitope (DC-LLO91\u201399 bars in Fig. 1C) that corresponded with a tight loop (pink LLO loop in Fig. 1A) that binds to MHC-I molecules in both mice strains. Lower DC activation was observed with LLO296\u2013304 epitopes (DC-LLO296\u2013304 bars in Fig. 1C), which corresponded with a wide loop that binds to MHC-I molecules in both mice strains (green LLO epitopes in Fig. 1A). Very low DC activation was observed only with LLO189\u2013201 epitope (DC-LLO189\u2013201 bars in Fig. 1C) that corresponded with two complete \u03b1-helices that bind to MHC-II molecules in both mice strains (purple LLO epitopes in Fig. 1A). No DC activation was observed with LLO189\u2013200 or LLO190\u2013201 epitopes (Fig. 1C) that corresponded with one \u03b1-helix that binds exclusively to MHC-II of only one mice strain.

For this purpose, we adapted a classical delayed-type-hypersensitivity (DTH) test (Mohamed et al., 2012), where DC vaccines loaded with LLO or GAPDH peptides plus Advax adjuvant (50 \u03bcg/ml) were inoculated into the foot pads of previously Listeria-challenged mice and the DTH response measured as the degree of footpad swelling 24 h post-inoculation (Fig. 1D). We included a positive control of DTH response, DC infected in vitro with wild type LM (DC-LMWT) that induced a high degree of footpad swelling as previously reported (Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2015). In both mice strains, DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-GAPDH1\u201322 vaccines generated the highest DTH responses, similar to the positive control DC-LMWT, followed by DC-LLO91\u201399, then DC-LLO296\u2013304 and lastly DC-LLO189\u2013201. DC-LLO190\u2013201 induced a low DTH response only in susceptible Balb/c mice and DC-LLO189\u2013200 induced no response in either strain (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that the size of the DTH responses elicited by the DC epitope vaccines formulated with Advax adjuvant, correlated well with the ability of the peptides to induce DC activation and with the initial bioinformatic predictions (Fig. 1B\u2013C). The removal of Advax adjuvant from the DC vaccine formulations reduced all DTH results ~ 5-fold but the Advax adjuvant did not modify the controls (data not shown), confirming that its action was via enhancement of antigen-specific T-cell responses. This is consistent with enhancement of antigen-specific T-cell responses observed with Advax adjuvant in other contexts such as when combined with influenza, hepatitis B or SARS coronavirus vaccines (Honda-Okubo et al., 2012, Honda-Okubo et al., 2015, Saade et al., 2013).",

We observed that for both mouse strains, DC-GAPDH1\u201322, DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-LLO91\u201399 vaccines induced the highest TNF-\u03b1 levels followed by DC-LLO296\u2013304.

Only DC-GAPDH1\u201322 and DC-GAPDH1\u201315 induced significant levels of IL-12 in both mice strains, with IL-12 having been shown to correlate with protective vaccine responses against listeriosis (Kono et al., 2012 and Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014). DC-LLO91\u201399 vaccines produced low but significant levels of IL-12 in both mice strains whereas DC-LLO296\u2013304, DC-LLO189\u2013201, DC-LLO190\u2013201 and DC-LLO189\u2013200 induced no detectable IL-12 levels (Table 2).

Mice were immunized i.p with a single dose of vaccine and 7 days later were administered a Listeria challenge (see Methods section for procedures). Five days post-challenge, all mice were bled, sacrificed and spleens recovered to count Listeria CFU and analyse immune cell populations (Fig. 2A and Table 3\n). DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-GAPDH1\u201322 provided the greatest protection in both Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (~ 97 and 99%, respectively) (Fig. 2A). DC-LLO91\u201399 also conferred significant protection in both Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (90 and 93%, respectively). DC-LLO296\u2013304 vaccine conferred strong protection in C57BL/6 mice (~ 90%) (Fig. 2A) but only intermediate levels of protection in Balb/c mice (~ 60%) (white bars in Fig. 2A). DC-LLO189\u2013200, DC-LLO190\u2013201, and DC-LLO189\u2013201 vaccines conferred no significant protection in either strain (2 and 5%, respectively). Vaccination efficiency was associated with normal spleen size (images of DC-GAPDH1\u201315 vaccine recipients shown in Fig. 2A) compared with enlarged spleens (images of NV mice in Fig. 2A) and granulomatous livers of non-vaccinated mice (data not shown). We also evaluated several immunological parameters induced by the most protective DC vaccines. DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-GAPDH1\u201322 vaccines were found to induce the highest frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in both C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice (4.0\u20134.2%, respectively) followed by DC-LLO91\u201399 vaccine with 3.0% frequency as assessed by FACS using H2-Kb:Ig-peptide dimers or 2.16% frequency using H2-Ld:Ig-peptide dimers (right plot in Fig. 2B). DC-LLO296\u2013304 vaccine induced very low 0.87% CD8+ T cell frequencies in C57BL/6 mice and undetectable frequencies in Balb/c mice (DC-LLO296\u2013304 bars in Fig. 2B). Only DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-GAPDH1\u201322 vaccines induced detectable numbers of IFN-\u03b3 producing peptide-specific CD4+ T cells (1.05 and 1.76%, respectively) (Fig. 2B show C57BL/6 data, values in Balb/c were 1.05 and 1.76%). In summary, our results with DC-GAPDH vaccines confirmed that CD8+ T cell responses were more relevant than CD4+ T cell responses for Listeria protection. GAPDH1\u201315 and GAPDH1\u201322 peptides presented high numbers of MHC-I binding epitopes in listeriosis resistant and sensible mice, explaining DC-GAPDH vaccines induced similar CD8+ T cell responses and Th1-cytokines in both mice strains.",

However, antibodies against LLO seemed to participate in neutralization of Listeria growth (Edelson and Unanue, 2001). Here, we confirmed no variation in B cell numbers among non-vaccinated (NV), vaccinated mice (DC vaccines) or non-infected control mice (control) with similar percentages of CD19+ positive cells (Spleen markers rows in Table 3). Nevertheless, DC-GAPDH1\u201322 (DC-GAPDH1\u201322 rows in Table 3) or DC-GAPDH1\u201315 vaccines (data not shown) produced high levels of anti-GAPDH1\u201322 IgM antibodies compared to non-vaccinated mice (NV) that correlated with an increase in the percentages of CD4+ T cells. DC-LLO91\u201399 vaccinated mice produced no significant levels of anti-LLO91\u201399 IgM antibodies compared to NV and presented low percentages of CD4+ T cells (DC-LLO91\u201399 rows in Table 3). These data strongly suggested that vaccines conferring the highest protection in listeriosis induced prominent antigen-specific T cell responses and promoted also antigen-specific B cell responses, suggesting a collaborative role of B and T cell responses in listeriosis protection (Edelson and Unanue, 2001, Alvarez-Dominguez et al., 2008, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2015).",

Only DC-GAPDH1\u201315 and DC-GAPDH1\u201322 vaccines induced high IL-12 levels, post-challenge, in both mice strains (right plot in Fig. 2C). DC-LLO91\u201399 vaccine induced low but significant levels of IL12 in both mice strains (Kono et al., 2012, Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014). Thus the Listeria T-cell epitope prediction algorithm described in the methods was validated in vivo and shown to predict vaccine effectiveness after Listeria vaccination of low and high susceptibility mice. Advax adjuvant was confirmed to be important to induction of a potent Listeria antigen specific T-cell response, consistent with its ability to enhance vaccine protection in other models including influenza, where it similarly enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and Th1 cytokine production (Honda-Okubo et al., 2012). The present results confirm that Advax adjuvant has the ability to induce MHC I cross-presentation of Listeria antigens thereby resulting in activation of Listeria-specific CD8 T cells, although the mechanism by which it might induce cross-presentation is currently unknown. One possibility currently under investigation is that Advax induces cross-presentation via activation of CD4+ T helper cells that signal to upregulate cross-presentation pathways in antigen presenting cells. When considering design of Listeria vaccines, a major advantage of Advax over other potential T-cell adjuvants is its lack of toxicity as evidenced by data from preclinical studies (Lobgis et al., 2010, Cristillo et al., 2011, Eckersley et al., 2011, Layton et al., 2011, Larena et al., 2013, Petrovsky et al., 2013, Saade et al., 2013, Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2014, Feinen et al., 2014, Honda-Okubo et al., 2014, Honda-Okubo et al., 2015) as well as human clinical trials (Gordon et al., 2012, Gordon et al., 2014).",

            "text": "New methods of T-cell epitope screening would greatly assist design of DC vaccine formulations, including for protection against listeriosis. Here we have developed a method for DC vaccine design that combines bioinformatic prediction of MHC binding epitopes with 3D structural predictions and DC functional assays utilising Advax, a potent T-cell adjuvant, to amplify the signal. Using these methodologies, we successfully predicted Listeria epitopes that when incorporated in DC vaccines and administered to either Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were able to confer protection against Listeria challenge. Peptides binding at least four MHC-I molecules with high affinity due to tight loops and also containing a weaker MHC-II binding epitope containing two \u03b1-helices, elicited the highest DC activation, the strongest DTH immune responses and the highest production of IL-12. These properties conferred the greatest protection in mouse strains at either high or low susceptibility to listeriosis. The GAPDH1\u201315 epitope possessed these minimal requirements and proved to have similar protective efficacy to the longer GAPDH1\u201322 epitope. This methodology might help to design new human and veterinary vaccines against listeriosis, an area of need given the increasing incidence of this disease in European countries (Pe\u00f1a-Sagredo et al., 2008, Valero and Rafart, 2014, P\u00e9rez-Trallero et al., 2014). The methodology used in this study to predict the best T-cell epitopes for vaccine design, might be useful in design of DC vaccines against other infectious diseases, and notably the protective GAPDH1\u201315 epitope showed 98% homology with S. pneumonia and Streptococcus pyogenes (Alvarez-Dominguez et al., 2008).",

Homogenates were stimulated 5 h with GAPDH1\u201315 or GAPDH1\u201322 peptides then intracellular cytokine staining performed. Histograms show the frequency of GAPDH1\u201315 (left lower plot) and GAPDH1\u201322-specific CD4+ T cells (right lower plot) and IFN-\u03b3 producers in C57BL/6 spleen homogenates. Experiments were performed in triplicate and results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD (P < 0.05). To measure the frequencies of CD8+ GAPDH-specific immune responses (right plots), splenocytes from vaccinated mice were incubated with recombinant dimeric H-2Kb:Ig (black bars) or H-2Ld:Ig (white bars) fusion proteins loaded with LLO91\u201399, LLO296\u2013304, GAPDH1\u201315 or GAPDH1\u201322 peptides, respectively. The staining cocktail contained the dimeric fusion protein loaded with the peptides, CD8 and IFN-\u03b3 antibodies. CD8+ cells were gated for anti-IFN-\u03b3 staining (% Gated dimer-CD8) to calculate the frequencies of CD8+-GAPDH1\u201315 or CD8+-GAPDH1\u201322 restricted cells and IFN-\u03b3 producers.
