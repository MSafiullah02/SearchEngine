            "text": "To the developed world, rabies remains a largely neglected disease. Highly efficacious vaccines are available and in the event of an unvaccinated individual becoming exposed, prompt application of recommended procedures prior to clinical disease will avoid fatalities. The UK has had a rabies-free status for over 100 years, maintained by bio-security measures, rigorous public health management systems and more recently through the implementation of the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) with retention of quarantine rules, in existence since 1901, for non-PETS animals. Even with these measures in place, the threat of re-introduction of the virus still exists on three levels. Firstly, the legal and illegal importation of live animals into the UK poses a threat, especially with the increased movement of human populations from areas of endemnicity both within Europe and outside of the European Union (EU) into the UK. Secondly, the indigenous bat population is known to carry a virus genetically related to rabies virus, the European bat lyssavirus (EBLV). Molecular characterization of this virus has further classified it as being EBLV type 2, genetically distinct from a similar virus (EBLV-1) that has caused several human deaths across Europe.",

This isolated case led to a renewed interest in these viruses with extensive media coverage fuelling concerns over the threat of these viruses to the public, and in particular, the role of bat species as reservoir hosts. Finally, a lack of awareness of the threat of rabies and related viruses to travelers visiting endemic areas also constitutes a re-introduction threat to the UK population. Unfortunately, human tragedy is often required to raise public awareness to the threat of zoonotic disease. The tragic case of a young Irish woman succumbing to infection with rabies virus in 2009 once again raised the public profile of rabies within the UK, although this was not the first time that infection with rabies virus has been brought to public attention in recent times (Johnson et al., 2002, Fooks et al., 2003c, Hunter et al., 2010).",

Official quarantine measures were tightened further for dogs in 1922 and cats in 1928. The purpose of quarantine was so that rabies can be detected, contained and eliminated in controlled conditions with minimal risk of transmission to humans, domestic animals and wildlife. This stringent disease control method has been highly effective in protecting both the human and animal populations of Britain from rabies. Since 1922, there have been twenty-seven cases of rabies that have been confirmed and controlled (Fooks et al., 2004a). In 1969, a dog imported from India died of rabies in quarantine and in the same year two dogs, which had been released from the same quarantine station as the original dog, also died. This led to the introduction of the administration of rabies vaccine to all animals either prior to or on entering quarantine (Fooks et al., 2004a).",

Nine days after arriving at the centre, one of the five dogs died and tested strongly positive for rabies antigen in a brain sample submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA). This finding immediately led to a full public investigation trying to track all who may have come into contact with the infected animals, and arranging rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) where necessary. Vaccination status of those reported to have had contact with the puppy varied enormously with several individuals having had no pre-immunisation against the virus (Fooks et al., 2008).",

Following numerous cases of lyssavirus positive bats across Europe it is now accepted that bat lyssaviruses are endemic within UK and European bat populations. Cases of lyssavirus infection of both bats and incidences of spill-over infection from bats into humans and terrestrial wildlife species continue to occur, albeit rarely, across Europe. The majority of cases of EBLV-1 have been reported in Serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) (Fooks et al., 2003a), although a number of other species are susceptible to infection (Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008, Muller et al., 2007). Furthermore, EBLV-1 infection has also been reported in spill-over events, in incidental hosts including a stone marten, sheep and humans (Muller et al., 2004, Ronsholt, 2002, Selimov et al., 1989) with seropositivity and antigen detection in domestic cats also being reported (Dacheux et al., 2009, Bourhy et al., 2005, Tjornehoj et al., 2004). In comparison to EBLV-1, EBLV-2 has been reported on fewer occasions, having been detected in both Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii), native to the UK and pond bats (Myotis dasycneme), a European species occasionally found in the UK. As well as having been isolated in the UK, EBLV-2 isolates have also been reported in Switzerland, Holland, Germany and Finland (Lumio et al., 1986, Van der Poel et al., 2005, Muller et al., 2007, Freuling et al., 2008, Jakava-Viljanen et al., 2010).",

In particular, the species of bats most often received are generally a factor of geographical location of roosts and the resulting proximity to humans and their pets. As many as 17% of submitted bats were brought into human habitation by pet cats (Harris et al., 2009). Obviously, bats that establish roost sites in buildings that are frequented by members of the public are more likely to be noticed, collected, and submitted when they are found dead or injured, a factor that has led to the repeated detection of EBLV-2 from a single location over a 2-year period (Banyard et al., 2009).",

            "text": "As well as passive surveillance of bat populations, active surveillance initiatives have also been undertaken. Between 2003 and 2006, the VLA, in collaboration with Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage, and Defra undertook targeted surveillance for European bat lyssaviruses throughout Scotland and England, focussing on the two bat species most likely to host these viruses, Daubenton's and Serotine bats (Harris et al., 2009). Blood and oropharyngeal swabs were taken for the detection of EBLV-specific neutralising antibodies and viral RNA or infectious virus in saliva, respectively. This initiative sampled 273 Serotine bats and 363 Daubenton's bats with the conclusion that, in the populations tested, there was an EBLV-2 antibody prevalence of 1.0\u20134.1% (95% CI, mean = 2.2%). Interestingly, EBLV-1-specific antibodies were only detected from one sample in a Serotine bat. The seroprevalence of EBLV-2 within Daubenton's bats reported in this study is very low compared to data from Spanish bat populations where much greater seroconversion levels were reported (Perez-Jorda et al., 1995, Vazquez-Moron et al., 2008, Serra Cobo et al., 2002). This study proved that EBLV-2 infection is maintained in Daubenton's bat populations in the UK. The detection of only a single Serotine bat with EBLV-1-specific antibodies suggests that it is unlikely that EBLV-1 circulates in this species in England (Harris et al., 2009). Interestingly, between 1987 and 2009, 129 Serotine bats were examined through the passive surveillance scheme and all were negative for lyssavirus infection by fluorescent antibody test (FAT). From a geographical point of view, the UK population of Serotine bats seems to be restricted to southern England, often roosting in residential properties. The species is one of the least common in the UK with an estimated population of less than 15,000 individuals. With transmission of virus often linked to the availability of new vectors, it is thought that low numbers of Serotine bats in the UK may preclude maintenance of EBLV-1 in UK roosts (Harris et al., 2009).",

It is known that in the UK, Daubenton's bats co-roost with other species yet EBLV-2 infection of other UK bats has not been detected.

Where PEP was not administered, human deaths have occurred upon return to the UK. Incubation periods following exposure are variable and whilst often clinical disease ensues soon after infection, in some instances the incubation period can be considerably longer. The recent case of a 37-year-old woman from Northern Ireland dying from rabies virus infection following an incubation period of what may be up to 2 years illustrates this point. In this instance, the individual in question did not seek medical attention following an incident with aggressive dogs in South Africa (Hunter et al., 2010). Human rabies cases in the UK where exposure occurred abroad over the last 10 years are detailed in Table 2\n. A similar situation exists across Europe. The recent death of a Dutch traveler from infection with Duvenhage virus, a virus closely related to rabies virus, further illustrates the potential danger of these viruses to travelers. Here, a bat had flown into the face of a 34-year-old woman and very small puncture marks were identified on her face. Whilst the wound was washed with both detergent and alcohol swabs, PEP was not administered and 23 days after coming into contact with the bat, symptoms of clinical disease started to develop (van Thiel et al., 2008).",

However, the importance of pre-immunization cannot be ignored. Furthermore, in cases where exposure to the virus is suspected, whether by bites, scratches or other means of exposure, individuals should seek medical advice without delay. This also applies to travelers in low risk areas as other infectious agents may be present, or the animal may have strayed from an area of endemnicity. Indeed, even if the traveler exposed has been vaccinated, medical advice should be sought without delay. In addition to recommendations to seek medical advice, a few sensible precautions can be taken to avoid exposure in the first place. Contact with all wild or domestic animals should be avoided during travel. Simple first aid measures should also be taken if exposure is suspected. Washing the wound, if an animal bite has occurred, or site of exposure in the case of scratches or exchange of saliva to mucous membranes, with detergent for at least 5 min is strongly advised. If possible the area exposed to potential infection should also be doused in either iodine solution or, as iodine is often unavailable, a 40\u201350% alcohol solution where possible.

Two cases of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the UK from Nigeria and Mali in February 2009 show a potential threat to the UK population.

The international travel of both humans and animals increases the risk of interaction with species harboring zoonotic disease and also the risk of global spread of disease in infected individuals that are unaware they have even been exposed. Recent \u2018explosions\u2019 of zoonotic pathogens highlight the continued risk to populations to emerging diseases. SARS coronavirus, pandemic and avian influenza virus, West Nile Fever virus and to a lesser extent Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus have, in recent years, increased our awareness of the threat from zoonotic pathogens.",
