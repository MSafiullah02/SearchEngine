In the past, it was estimated that with the best possible management of flocks IBV infection will reduce income by approximately 3% when compared to an IBV-free flock [1]. There is approximately a 50% vaccine failure for Arkansas (Ark) serotype of IBV [2], the most prevalent vaccine serotype used in the USA. Symptoms of IBV infection include, but are not limited to, wet eyes, swollen face, tracheal and kidney lesions, respiratory disease, reduced weight gain in broilers, decreasing and poor egg quality in layers [3], [4]. The existence of various IBV serotypes as well as antigenic variants [4] complicates vaccination programs. Since immunity induced by vaccination against a single serotype generally provides insufficient protection against other serotypes [5], [6].",

This combined with the practice of immunizing and boosting for IBV early after hatching may set up the immune response for failure to protect. The second IBV immunization on day 14 of age, which by itself is fully protective, does not completely compensate for the premature priming on day 1 [8]. Field studies by de Wit et al. [3] demonstrated a lack of protective immunity when birds were boosted between day 8 through day 13 of age. The percentage of birds in a commercial flock positive for IBV-specific IgM antibodies was correlated with vaccine protection and increased with the age of boosting. This data supports the notion that early vaccination and boosting of the IBV immune response may limit induction of protective immune responses to IBV. Unlike the study by Gelb et al. [8], the de Wit et al. [3] study can also be interpreted that maternal antibodies interfere with vaccine delivery during the first 2 weeks of life [13].",

The splenic T cells from 1 day old chicks even produce inhibitory factors for proliferation of mature T cells in vitro [15]. Furthermore, splenic lymphocytes of 40 day old chicken displayed better antigen specific proliferation after oral Salmonella exposure than 10 day old chicken [16]. When measuring gene expression in lung and trachea in 1 and 4 week old birds after avian influenza exposure a reduced expression of immune-related genes was shown and included innate immune response genes in the younger birds [17]. Additional evidence that innate immune mechanisms are diminished in young chickens was demonstrated by a lower Salmonella phagocytic index of heterophils during the first few days of life [18]. Thus, early exposure to pathogens or vaccines may induce suboptimal innate and adaptive immune responses.",

The plates were blocked with PBS-BSA (1%) after which the samples were loaded at two-fold dilutions. Binding of chicken antibodies was detected using biotinylated anti-chicken-IgG, -IgA and -IgM monoclonal antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The plates were developed using TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5-Tetramethylbensidine; Invitrogen corp., Frederick, MD) substrate. The highest sample dilution with at least an optical density of 0.100 above background level at 450 nm was defined as the endpoint-titer. Ten to thirteen chickens were analyzed per group. The control group consisted out 3 chicken from each age group for IgA and IgG, which were pooled in one group of 15 since no differences were observed between the controls. For IgM levels in plasma the controls (each group containing 5 chickens except day 28 which had 3) were displayed separate for each age group. This was done because significant differences were observed between control IgM levels to IBV in different age groups.",

After washing the plates, the detection of IBV-specific antibodies was accomplished as previously reported [20]. The data were normalized to percent inhibition relative to samples not exposed to KSCN. The concentration of KSCN to inhibit 50% of the reactivity of the ELISA was defined as the avidity index [24], [25]. The OD450 read-out for the KSCN inhibition data was curve-fitted using 3-order polynomial regression analyses in Microsoft office Excell program. The Excell provided formula for the inhibition curve was used to determine the x values of y\n = 0.5, which are the concentrations of KSCN inhibiting 50% of the ELISA reactivity, representing the avidity indices of those samples.

Thus, only the day 7 group increases antibody titers on day 21 when compared to older birds. Thus, the day 7 group displays a delayed response in antibody production compared to older birds.

This time point was selected based on the literature in which the peak IgM response was observed between 5\u20139 days after virus challenge or live virus vaccination [26], [27], [28]. Due to the variability of IBV-reactive IgM in the controls between different age groups, independent controls were included for each age group. The IgM levels in the controls decreased considerably by \u223c2 week of age after (7 days after the day 7 old chick vaccination) which increased one week later and stabilized in older age control groups (Fig. 1E). The day 14 through day 28 control IgM levels were significantly higher than in the day 1 and day 7 age group controls. And the day 7 control was significantly lower than the day 1 control IgM levels. All IgM titers from the IBV vaccinated age groups were significantly higher when compared to their controls (P\n < 0.05) with exception of the day 21 age groups (P\n = 0.08). This was due to higher control values, which were \u223c1.6 fold higher than in the age 14 or 28 days old groups. This may reflect an initial peak of natural antibodies induced to IBV before stabilizing. The IBV vaccinated age groups did not differ significantly in IgM antibody levels to IBV with exception of the day 1 IBV vaccinated group, which mean \u00b1 SE was 8.7 \u00b1 0.6 had significantly lower IBV-specific IgM levels in plasma than the day 14 (10.2 \u00b1 0.4) day 21 (10.6 \u00b1 0.7) and day 28 (11.2 \u00b1 0.5) vaccinated birds but did not differ significantly from the day 7 (9.2 \u00b1 0.5) vaccinated birds (Fig. 1E).

Thus, early vaccination perpetuates the IBV problems and is a factor in the estimated $48 million or more annual loss to the poultry industry due to IBV infection [30]. Our measurements of mucosal and systemic antibody levels demonstrates a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the day 1, day 7 and 14 of age vaccination groups. IgA antibody levels in the day 1 group, unlike IgG antibodies, do not recover later in the response. Besides delayed IgG kinetics, the day 1 group displays also a lower avidity index than the day 28 vaccinated group. Lower avidity index is not observed in IgA antibodies. The delayed and/or lower antibody response and lower IgG avidity index translated in increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV challenge when compared to chicks vaccinated later in life. A lack of vaccine-mediated protection is most noticeable in the 1 day of age vaccination group and to a lesser extend the day 7 vaccination group, while the day 14 and older vaccinated chickens are protected.",

            "text": "The IgM antibodies specific for IBV were significantly elevated above controls on days 7 of the IBV immune response in all age groups except the day 21 group. The day 21 group was not quite significant (P\n = 0.08) because of higher IgM levels in the control group. This could be due to an initial surge of natural IgM antibodies to IBV in this age group. A significant decline in the 7 day old group is observed when comparing the IgM antibody levels to IBV in the control day 1 group. This would be consistent with a drop of presumably natural maternal IBV-specific IgM antibodies in these SPF chickens in the day 7 control age group. These IgM antibodies rapidly increases in the day 14 group after which they stabilize in the older age groups. This indicates that a considerable portion of IgM antibodies in plasma from the older vaccination groups reacts with IBV without seeing the virus, indicating these are natural antibodies to IBV, which only increase after day 14 of age. Bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract of chickens is established during the first two weeks post-hatch [31]. This, combined with the observation that probiotics enhance natural antibodies in chicken [32], indicates that IBV-specific natural IgM antibodies to IBV are possibly generated following intestinal colonization presumably by stimulating B1 cells, which are the main producers of natural IgM antibodies in sera of mammals [33]. In the IBV vaccinated groups we see a steadily incline of IgM IBV-specific antibodies in plasma with age as has been reported by De Wit et al. [3]. Only the day 1 age group displays significantly lower IgM antibody levels when compared with the day 14\u201328 age groups but not with the day 7 age group. This is consistent with an early in life deficiency or delay in the IgM response.",

            "text": "The lower avidity index for the IgG antibodies in 1-day-old chicks is an important factor contributing to decreased protection to IBV challenge. Increased antibody affinity maturation to virus vaccines strongly correlated with better protection [34], [35]. A lack of antibody affinity maturation observed following vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus was due to a lack of TLR stimulation [35]. This indicates that 1-day-old birds may be deficient in TLR expression. Evidence that this is the case comes from a recent publication [36] demonstrating, that significantly lower levels of TLR7 expression in spleen and small intestines were observed when comparing 1-day-old chicks with 4- to 5-week-old chickens. Inclusion of TLR activating adjuvants could alleviate the problems of early vaccination by boosting antibody production and affinity maturation in 1-day-old chicks. Neither monomeric plasma nor dimeric tears-derived IgA [37] displays this drop in avidity index for the day 1 vaccinated group (Fig. 3B,D). Although there is a lower level of IgA antibodies produced by the day 1 vaccinated birds compared to the older groups, which is consistent with a delay in class-switching in the day 1 old group, it is not clear why the lack of a mature mucosal immune system in the 1-day-old group [5], [6], [11], [12], [13] did not result in lower affinity maturation of mucosal IgA antibodies compared to the 4-week-old group.",

There exists a linear relationship with the hens\u2019 plasma antibody levels and transfer of IgY to the chicks\u2019 circulation [14]. Chicks were over 95% protected against IBV challenge on day 1 if they had high levels of maternal antibodies but less than 30% protected when challenged on day 7. This protection correlated with local respiratory antibodies and not serum antibodies [38]. IBV-specific maternal antibodies decreased the induction of neutralizing antibodies following boosting [38]. Despite this inhibition by maternal antibodies of the memory response, low or erratic maternal antibody titers to IBV in broiler flocks are associated with IBV-induced economic losses [39]. This further supports that protection by maternal antibodies, which are predominantly of the IgG isotype, is important to prevent activation of an immature immune system that is not capable generating a fully protective immune response early in life.",

However, in these studies day 1 vaccination was followed with a second vaccination two weeks later for optimal protection against challenge, which would have masked the relative poor IBV-specific immune responses after the day 1 immunization. Extensive immunization on the day of hatch containing three different live attenuated viruses, which caused severe vaccine symptoms, provided similar protection as two single live attenuated IBV virus vaccines on day of hatch and day 14 of age when challenged with a heterologous virus [42]. This seems to indicate that induction of cross-protective immunity may be less impaired when vaccinated early in life.
