Although it is understandable why some might hold this view, as this article outlines in the epidemiology section, biowarfare and bioterrorism have been practiced since prehistoric times. Despite efforts to restrict the use of biological weapons with the 1972 Conventions on the use of biological weapons, they need to remain a concern, particularly for critical care physicians of the future.",

In the 1990s, definitions focused primarily on bacterial or viral biological weapons and their potential use by states with the consideration of use by nonstate actors (eg, terrorists).3 More recent definitions of bioterrorism include both a broader range of potential biological agents as well as considering more diverse groups of potential targets and impacts of biological weapons. Spencer4 defines bioterrorism as \u201cthe use of micro-organisms as weapons of catastrophic effect which can be described as: the category or method of use of a weapon system that results in a significant negative impact on a nation\u2019s physical, psychological or economic well-being, thereby causing a major modification of routine activity.\u201d This definition highlights several key points. First, it highlights that a wide range of microorganisms must be considered and that their impact is not merely physical but may also include psychological and economic factors. Spencer further elaborates on his definition of bioterrorism by stating \u201cbioterrorism is best described as the use of micro-organisms (pathogens) or the products of living organisms (toxins) to inflict harm on a wider population, including animals and crops.\u201d4 The elaboration on his original definition highlights that not only are humans directly vulnerable to bioterrorism but we are vulnerable through indirect attacks on our livestock or crops, which has also been termed agroterrorism.5, 6 Other investigators broaden the definition further to not only include microorganisms and biotoxins but also larger organisms, specifically insects.6\n",

It is difficult to provide a clear-cut answer as to where bioterrorism should be prioritized on this list. Although some experts state that the risk of a large-scale bioterrorist attack is low,7 in a more recent analysis, US Senators Graham and Talent quote their conclusion form the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism in 2010, which stated \u201cunless the world community acts decisively and with great urgency, it is more likely than not that a [biologic] weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013.\u201d8 Anthrax in particular remains such a concern, because of both the lethality of the agent and also the potential availability given the number of governments that produced weaponized anthrax in the past.9 The later issue is of concern because of both the availability of expertise as well as the risk of residual caches of anthrax in failed states that are vulnerable for misappropriation. In addition, it may require less expertise to develop aerosolizable anthrax then previously believed.8, 9\nBox 1\nlists the capabilities required of any organization, whether state or nonstate, to conduct and deliver a bioterrorist attack. Even a small or moderate bioterrorism event has the potential to overwhelm local medical resources and cause significant civil and economic disruption as a result of the psychological impact of such an attack.Box 1Capabilities required of any organization to conduct and deliver a bioterrorist attack\n1.Organizational capabilities2.Adequate finances3.Logistical support4.Sufficient knowledge and necessary skills5.Access to materials and technology6.Ability to culture and propagate the organism7.Capacity to weaponize and deliver the agent\nAdapted from Spencer RC.

However, if these arguments are not persuasive enough, the knowledge that critical care physicians will play a key role in a bioterrorist event, and that their effectiveness in responding to the event is dependent on their medical knowledge regarding bioterrorism agents, should compel one to take the time to read this review. Agents used for bioterrorism typically cause critical illness and therefore are of clinical relevance to the intensivist. Several of the category A and B organisms (see later discussion) also produce human infections in nature, and therefore, knowledge of their presentation and treatment can also be applied in nonbioterrorism settings.",

However, Relman10 reminds us that it is important not to solely focus on the agents from the CDC list because they were largely driven by past military programs and do not include agents that were not of particular interest or relevance in the past but may be in the future given technological advances. In addition, military programs focused on weaponizing agents, whereas terrorists could seek to manipulate the natural spread of existing organisms or the development of novel strains.10\n",

Bacillus anthracis is a soil-borne organism and can be found in the environment globally. The organism grows quickly on standard culture media (6\u201324 h) and its spores are highly resistant, potentially being viable for decades. In naturally occurring infections, the organism may infect humans by transcutaneous inoculation (cutaneous anthrax), ingestion (gastrointestinal [GI] anthrax, including oropharyngeal), or inhalation (thoracic anthrax). In terms of use as an organism of bioterrorism, it is most likely to be delivered in its spore form as an inhaled agent. Once inhaled, Bacillus anthracis spores enter alveolar macrophages by phagocytosis and are transported to regional lymph nodes, where they germinate, typically within 2 to 5 days but they may be delayed up to 60 days.9, 13, 14 Symptoms start after germination and bacterial replication begins to occur. What causes the variability in incubation period associated with the time from infection with spores to germination to the vegetative bacillus is unknown.",

The natural reservoir for Yersinia pestis is rodents and the vector to humans is the oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis). Plague is highly communicable in the pneumonic form and may present as any of the following clinical syndromes: bubonic plague, primary pneumonic plague, primary septicemic plague, plague meningitis, plague pharyngitis, pestis minor, and subclinical infection. Aerosolized Yersinia pestis likely produces a clinical presentation identical to pneumonic plague. However, Yersinia pestis does not produce spores and is susceptible to destruction by drying, heat, and ultraviolet light, therefore making it significantly more challenging to weaponize it then anthrax. It is more readily transmitted via an infected vector, such as the oriental rat flea, or by person-to-person transmission.",

As discussed further in the epidemiology section, tularemia has been previously used as a biological weapon. The mode of deployment as a biological weapon in the past has often been through infected vectors22; however, a modern bioterrorist would most like deploy the agent via aerosolization and it could present as: primary pneumonic tularemia (inhalation), oculoglandular tularemia (eye contact), ulceroglandular (broken skin contact), or oropharyngeal (mucous membrane contact without deep inhalation). Tularemia is not communicable between humans, so specific isolation is not required; only standard universal precautions should be used. Decontamination for aerosolized exposure should involve remove clothing and jewelry and washing the skin with soap and water.",

It has a typical gram-negative cell wall structure, but does not stain well with Gram stain although it can be seen with a Gimenez stain. Coxiella burnetii has 2 morphologic forms: large and small cell variants. The small cell form is the extracellular form, which is metabolically inactive and resistant to chemical agents as well as environmental and physical conditions. The large cell variant is the metabolically active and pathogenic intracellular form. The disease is called Q fever for query fever, because the causative organism had not been identified at the time of the first documented large outbreaks. Q fever occurs worldwide and is associated with contact with sheep, goats, or cattle, particularly during birthing when placental exposure occurs. Human infection is through the inhalation of aerosolized organisms from infected animals. Coxiella burnetii is highly infectious to humans, and its sporelike small cell variant form makes it a potentially viable biological weapon. Most human cases of disease are zoonoses, with human-to-human infection only rarely reported; therefore, only standard infection control precautions are required in the clinical setting. However, Coxiella burnetii is highly infectious from culture and therefore should always be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions. Environmental decontamination should a culture spill or bioterrorism release occur is difficult given the highly resistant features of the small cell variant.23\n",

A large vulnerable population has existed since smallpox vaccination was stopped in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Variola is highly communicable, and can be transmitted by airborne, droplet, and fomite (bed linen and clothing) transmission in addition to direct contact. Infection starts in mucosa of airway, then the virus replicates in regional lymph nodes before subsequently resulting in an asymptomatic primary viremia 3 to 4 days after infection with spread to the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. Secondary viremia occurs (day 8\u201312), in which the virus localizes in the dermis and oropharyngeal mucosa and is marked by the onset of symptoms and infectivity. Five clinical syndromes of variola infection are seen: classic (unvaccinated only), modified (vaccinated or unvaccinated), flat (vaccinated or unvaccinated) hemorrhagic, and variola sine eruptione (vaccinated only).",

All of the viruses have in common that they attack the vascular endothelium, leading to vascular leak and potentially producing shock or coagulopathies. With the exception of hantavirus, natural transmission is primarily by respiratory droplets and body fluids but not by airborne aerosol. Aerosol transmission of hantaviruses from the urine of rodents has been well documented. Most secondary (human-to-human) transmission of VHF is to family members or health care workers caring for patients with VHF. The primary mode of transmission in these cases is direct contact with infected body fluids and percutaneous exposures. However, questions still remain regarding the possibility of aerosol transmission, particularly for Lassa fever or from aerosol-generating procedures.33 Several of the VHF viruses have reportedly been weaponized by the Russian and the US militaries. Isolation for all VHF is strict droplet and contact precautions. Patients who are end stage or have significant pulmonary involvement may warrant airborne isolation in a negative pressure room, if available. For specific details regarding isolation and environmental decontamination procedures for VHF, see the CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Managing Patients with Suspected Viral Hemorrhagic Fever in US Hospitals, available online at http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/bbp/VHFinterimGuidance05_19_05.pdf (Accessed January, 2013).

These organisms typically cause a self-limited respiratory illness in immunocompetent individuals. Coccidioidomycosis is typically transmitted by inhalation, particularly after events such as earthquakes or dust storms, which generate airborne particulate mater from the soil. Human-to-human transmission does not occur. Overall, the long incubation period and mild clinical presentations in most individuals make Coccidioides an unattractive agent as a bioweapon. However, given the ease of access to the organism and its natural propensity for aerosol transmission, its potential use should not be ignored. Keeping an open mind about possible future bioterrorism agents is essential if we are truly going to be prepared.10\n",

Castor beans are available worldwide and ricin is a natural by-product produced in the processing of castor beans to castor oil. The waste products resulting from the processing of castor beans contain approximately 5% ricin.24 In its pure form, ricin is a white powder that is soluble in water and stable over a wide range of pH. Chemically, ricin is a glycoprotein lectin with A and B chains joined by a disulfide bond. The B chain binds to galactose-containing proteins and lipids on cell surfaces, causing direct membrane damage and release of cytokines, whereas the A chain inhibits eukaryotic ribosomes by removal of adenine from the 28 rRNA loop in the 60 subunit, therefore stopping protein synthesis, leading to cell death. Ricin is less toxic by weight compared with botulinum toxin or staphylococcal enterotoxin type B (SEB), but is more readily available and easy to produce in large quantities than either of these agents. Ricin can be deployed as a bioweapon via several routes, including inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Clearly, as a bioterrorism agent with the intent to cause mass casualties, inhalation or ingestion is more likely than injection. After exposure, decontamination should include removal of clothing and jewelry, washing with soap and water, followed by rinsing with copious amounts of water.",

Seven types of toxins exist and are identified as types A to G, with A, B, and E causing most cases of human disease. The toxin contains 3 chains (heavy, light, nontoxic hemaglutinin). The heavy chain permits the toxin to bind with the cell, and the light chain contains zinc-dependent endopeptidase, which stops calcium release. Botulinum toxin binds to peripheral presynaptic cholinergic terminals (including muscarinic and nicotinic) and blocks the calcium-dependent exocytosis process.

It also interferes with DNA polymerase and monoamine oxidase. The organs affected first are those are with rapidly reproducing cell lines (GI tract, bone marrow, and skin) as well as impairing proteins involved in coagulation and the Krebs cycle.

The questions considered in this score have to be answered at the public health level, not the individual clinician level, because they require a level of situational awareness not attainable by a clinician in a hospital. The importance of clinicians working effectively with public health agencies is further reinforced by computer modeling work by Hupert and colleagues,49 which suggests that even minor delays in detecting (diagnosing) and initiating the response to a large-scale anthrax attack would make even perfectly executed prophylaxis campaigns ineffective in preventing the health care system from being overwhelmed by cases.Box 5Features that suggest a bioterrorism event rather than an epidemic\n1.An epidemic curve that suggests a point source (common source) outbreak or extended source rather then a naturally propagated (transmitted) source (Fig. 2\n)2.Identification of a cluster of cases (large numbers of patients from a similar geographic area with similar symptoms)3.High and rapid fatality among cases4.A large number of casualties within the first 48 to 72 hours after the attack (suggesting an attack with a microorganism) or within minutes to hours (suggesting an attack with a toxin)5.A lower attack rate in people who were indoors than in those who were outdoorsa\n6.An unusually high prevalence of respiratory involvement in diseases that, when acquired in nature, generally cause a nonpulmonary syndrome7.Casualty distribution aligned with wind direction8.An illness type highly unusual for the geographic area9.Appearance of a category A, B, or C disease10.Increased numbers of sick or dead animals, of varying species, in a defined geographic area11.Witness to an attack, or discovery of an appropriate delivery system\n\na Less reliable, because the opposite may be true if a building\u2019s ventilation system was used to disperse the agent.Data from Karwa M, Bronzert P, Kvetan V.

The clinical presentation of the 3 anthrax syndromes is outlined in Table 8\n. Cutaneous anthrax most often affects the hands, arms, and face. One of the main differential diagnoses for cutaneous anthrax are spider bites, and Table 9\npresents clues to help distinguish between the 2. The diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax can often be made clinically followed by laboratory confirmation. Other laboratory and radiologic investigations are of limited use in cutaneous anthrax. Conversely, in the cases of GI and thoracic anthrax, the clinical presentation is relatively nonspecific, and radiologic investigations, especially for inhalational anthrax,52 along with laboratory and microbiological testing are essential for making the diagnosis. With thoracic anthrax, sputum cultures are rarely positive but first blood cultures are almost always positive.7\n",

Kyriacou and colleagues53 conducted a retrospective review of cases of bioterrorism-acquired thoracic anthrax and compared them with cases of CAP or influenza. These investigators found that the most accurate predictor of anthrax was mediastinal widening or pleural effusions on chest radiograph, which were 100% sensitive, 71.8% specific compared with CAP, and 95.6% specific compared with influenza (see Fig. 2). Other features more common in anthrax were: nausea, vomiting, pallor, cyanosis, diaphoresis, altered level of consciousness, and increased hematocrit level. Two groups54, 55 have developed screening criteria to help diagnose anthrax after a known bioterrorism incident. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that although both criteria would have identified cases of anthrax, the Mayer criteria55 would have screened only 4 patients (cost $1900 USD), whereas the Hupert criteria54 would have screened 273 patients ($126,025 USD).56\n",

The first 3 syndromes are the most common presentations and their diagnostic features are outlined in Table 10\n. Bubonic plagues is characterized by initial lymphadenitis, most commonly inguinal, followed by the development of a systemic illness, which may include secondary plague pneumonia. Primary septicemic plague is similar to bubonic plague, without the initial appearance of buboes. It remains unclear if it is the same entity with subclinical lymphadenitis or a distinct pathophysiologic process. Pneumonic plague may be primary, which presents as an acute respiratory infection, or may occur as a result of hematologic spread (secondary) from bubonic or primary septicemic plague. Hemoptysis is frequently seen with pneumonic plague and can help differentiate it from anthrax or tularemia.7 General laboratory and radiologic investigations are nonspecific and the diagnosis is primarily made via microbiology testing (see Table 7). Automated culture detection systems may not detect or can misidentify Yersinia pestis, and therefore, if there is a high level of suspicion for plague, the microbiology laboratory should be made aware of this when the cultures are ordered.",

The average incubation period is 3 to 5 days, but ranges from 1 to 21 days. The pneumonic form typically presents with: fever, chills, headache, malaise, coryza, cough, chest pain, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, arthralgia, septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The ulceroglandular form presents with cutaneous ulcers 0.5 to 3 cm with heaped-up edges and regional lymphadenopathy. Ulceroglandular infections may progress to systemic disease similar to the pneumonic form. The typhoidal form does not involve lymphadenopathy. The typhoidal form usually involves the lung primarily, whereas the ulceroglandular form first affects the mediastinal lymph nodes, then progresses to parenchymal involvement. Microbiological testing is required to make the diagnosis, although cultures are generally low yield given the difficulty growing the organism. Therefore, alternative techniques for identification such as immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are preferred.7 Radiologic findings are generally nonspecific, although approximately 75% of patients with tularemia present with bronchopneumonia, typically bilateral, and may develop cavities. Only approximately 33% have lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions, which is significantly lower than would be expected with thoracic anthrax.52\n",

The CDC has published a case definition to aid in the diagnosis of cases (Box 6\n). Classic smallpox begins with a prodrome of fever and constitutional symptoms. After 2 to 4 days, the rash begins to emerge, initially as small red spots in the mouth and throat, which develop into sores that erupt and discharge virus, making the patient highly infectious at this point. At about the same time that the sores in the mouth begin to open, a rash develops on the skin. The rash is said to spread in a centrifugal pattern, starting on the face, then spreading to the extremities. The lesions progress from macules, to papules (day 2 of rash), umbilicated vesicles (day 4\u20135), and pustules (day 7) before crusting over (Fig. 3\n). In contrast to chickenpox (varicella), in smallpox, all the lesions progress at the same stage and the lesions are more densely concentrated on the face and extremities (Figs. 4 and 5\n). A single suspected case of smallpox is a public health emergency and the local public health agency should be notified immediately if there is a suspected case.Box 6Smallpox case definition\nClinical:\u2022Acute onset of fever higher than 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C)and\u2022Rash characterized by firm, deep-seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause\nLaboratory:\u2022PCR identification of variola DNA in a clinical specimenor\u2022Isolation of smallpox (variola) virus from a clinical specimen (World Health Organization Smallpox Reference laboratory or laboratory with appropriate reference capabilities) with variola PCR confirmation\nCase ClassificationConfirmed case: A case of smallpox that is laboratory confirmed, or a case that meets the clinical case definition that is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed caseProbable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, or a case that does not meet the clinical case definition but is clinically consistent with smallpox and has an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case of smallpox.

An effective response to a bioterrorism incident requires a coordinated effort between clinicians and public health. Critical care clinicians must be familiar with the diagnosis and management of the most likely bioterrorism agents, and also be adequately prepared to manage a mass casualty situation.",

(B) (bar graph) A propagated source outbreak in which the disease is transmissible from 1 person to another. In this situation, particularly early in the outbreak, the number of cases does not increase in a linear fashion, but rather peaks and troughs associated with the natural transmission cycle (incubation period and infectious period) are seen. The line shows a steady increase in cases, which suggests an extended exposure to a source, as may be seen in a bioterrorism event (although it can occur naturally on occasion, although this is uncommon).",
