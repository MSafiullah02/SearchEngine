The majority of these infections are managed by the primary care physicians and they settle with conservative and medical management. However, a small group can progress to become troublesome and develop complications to the extent that they may require surgical intervention. Some of the infections can lead to life-threatening complications therefore awareness and correct diagnosis along with appropriate management is paramount. Foreign bodies in the ear, nose and throat are commonly encountered. The location and type of foreign body can have an implication on the urgency of action and the possible complications. In this article the common ENT infections and foreign bodies and their management are discussed.",

By 3 years of age, up to 85% of children will have had an episode of AOM. The incidence peaks between age 6 and 12 months, and recurrent acute otitis media is common, affecting 10e20% of children by age of one year. 1 AOM is a result of different host factors as well as environmental and microbiological factors. It often starts as a viral upper respiratory infection leading to bacterial superinfection later on.",

Group A beta haemolytic streptococcus is the most common cause of bacterial tonsillitis and pharyngitis; spread is by droplet transmission. It is believed up to 30% of sore throats in children and up to 15% of sore throats in adults are due to bacterial tonsillitis. 6 Tonsillitis can be part of systemic diseases such as infectious mononucleosis, characterized by inflamed swollen tonsils. The diagnosis of tonsillitis is based on clinical findings of pharyngeal inflammation and tonsillar hypertrophy with or without tonsillar exudates and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Throat swabs for culture and sensitivity are not very useful in the management of tonsillitis although they may assist management in protracted illness.",

            "text": "Upper aerodigestive tract foreign bodies Ingested or inhaled foreign bodies (FBs) are common in children and in adults. They can be life threatening and cultural factors dictate the type of foreign body ingested. Foreign bodies could be small toys, coins or foods like fish bones and meat bolus with or without bones (e.g. lamb meat). Pharygo-oesophageal FBs with sharp edges (e.g. a piece of chicken bone) or button batteries need to be prioritized due to risk of perforation if not treated appropriately. The vast majority of swallowed FBs pass through the digestive tract and are egested often undetected. The main complications of foreign bodies are aspiration, migration of foreign body, oesophageal perforation and abscess. Plain radiographs with lateral view can help in the diagnosis and localization of the foreign body. The FBs are removed under general anaesthesia in case of children. In the case of adults, FBs can be removed with different techniques ranging from flexible or rigid angled nasoendoscopy and curved forceps under local anaesthesia to flexible oesophagoscopy and rigid endoscopy under general anaesthesia. 15 Acute aspiration of FBs in the airway needs to be treated by 'Heimlich's manoeuvre'. This has become part of public education and first aid procedure. The manoeuvre involves compression of upper abdomen to exert pressure on the diaphragm and subsequently on the lungs to expel the FB. In infants, it involves lying the child on an adult's knee and pressing firmly on the upper abdomen. Peak incidence of inhaled FB is between 1 and 3 years of age and there is typically a history of choking episode. If the child is well enough then a chest x-ray will help with diagnosis and localization of FB. The main complications of untreated tracheobronchial tree FBs are pneumonia and pneumothorax. In the acute emergency with a compromised airway, high flow oxygen and Heliox (i.e. helium and oxygen) buys time for definitive treatment. Removal is achieved by the ENT surgeon aided by senior paediatric anaesthetist using a bronchoscope and optical forceps under general anaesthesia. Once the FB is removed, meticulous examination of the tracheobronchial tree must be undertaken to exclude fragments or further FBs or any anatomical variations. The child should be closely monitored for 24 hours. Children with a history of inhaled foreign body and persistent respiratory symptoms should be assumed to have a foreign body in the lung and managed appropriately. ",
