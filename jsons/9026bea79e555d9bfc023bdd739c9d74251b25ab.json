Although many pathogens may cause respiratory tract infections, viruses are the most frequently implicated. Respiratory tract infections have a significant socioeconomic impact due to work and school absenteeism, despite mostly having a mild and selflimiting clinical course [Bramley et al., 2002; Fendrick et al., 2003] . Annual winter epidemics of severe respiratory infections in infants and young children are caused by a range of respiratory viruses. To date, identification of the causative pathogen in respiratory tract infections has mainly been limited to clinical research studies, and routine testing has yet to become common in general practice.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and seasonal influenza viruses are responsible for a significant majority of viral respiratory illnesses in humans worldwide, which in turn place a heavy burden on healthcare systems. RSV causes mainly infections in young children and infants, typically as an epidemic during midwinter, particularly in temperate regions. It is estimated that 70% of children are infected before they reach the age of 1 year, with affected individuals usually presenting with bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, bronchitis, or croup [Glezen et al., 1986] . The influenza viruses, on the other hand, are known to cause yearly epidemics, especially during the winter months. They normally give rise to a systemic illness with high fever, myalgia, and a dry cough which may be lifethreatening in high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with chronic cardio-respiratory conditions. Although the initial infection itself can be quite debilitating, there is also the risk of acquiring a secondary bacterial superinfection. The common cold, which is the most frequent form respiratory tract infections, is caused mainly by the HRV. Infection may progress rarely to pneumonia or lead to exacerbation of asthma in children [Pierangeli et al., 2007; Matthew et al., 2009] . The human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is also known to cause respiratory tract infection in children and adults, accounting for approximately 5-10% of cases annually [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] . Other viruses such as human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have also been implicated worldwide. Discovered recently, human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2007] have joined the family of viruses that cause respiratory tract infections.",

The median age for the other detected viruses was 39 months (8-74). Patients with RSV were strikingly younger than those affected by other viruses, whereas the influenza viruses affected older children (Fig. 1) . The difference in median age between patients with RSV and the other viruses (HRV, influenza A, and influenza B) was statistically significant (P < 0.05).",

            "text": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and epidemiological characteristics of patients with influenza-like illnesses during the 2011-2012 influenza season. The overall detection rate of a respiratory virus in our study population was 52%, a value that is slightly higher than previously reported rates of 37% and 48% [Druce et al., 2005; Brittain-Long et al., 2008] . This difference could be attributed to variations in age, seasonality, environmental factors, and socioeconomic status. Patients enrolled in this study were indeed younger, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained during the peak season for respiratory tract infections, both of which are factors known to increase diagnostic yield. Furthermore, the PCR assays performed in this study allowed for the detection of a wider variety of viruses, including HBoV, HCoV-OC43, NL63, and HMP, which improves detection rate. Underdeveloped immunity and prolonged viral shedding are believed to be the main contributing factors for the higher incidence of viral respiratory tract infections in children [Jartti et al., 2004; Naghipour et al., 2009; To et al., 2010] . Furthermore, unlike adults, young children tend to be brought to medical attention earlier in the course of disease, and it has been established that the detection rate with RT-PCR is correlated inversely with the duration of symptoms [Brittain-Long et al., 2010] . In this study, 60% of children presenting to the outpatient clinic with influenza-like illnesses were younger than 5 years of age. A comparison of presenting age between viral pathogens revealed patients with RSV to be significantly younger than patients with HRV, influenza A, and influenza B (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Khamis et al. [2012] observed in community-based study that RSV infec-tion occurred solely in children aged less than 2 years of age, with 57% of infections occurring in infants younger than 6 months. The oldest patient with RSV in the present study was a 67-month-old child, and only 4 (25%) out of 16 patients with documented RSV were older than 2 years of age. Additionally, an influenza virus was detected in nearly two-thirds of patients who were included in the virally infected group, with an overall frequency in children with influenza-like illnesses of 32%. In this research group's study from last influenza season, influenza viruses were detected in 129 of 300 patients (43%) with influenza-like illnesses [Ceyhan et al., 2012] . While the H1N1 strain of influenza A was predominant last season, it has been replaced this season by the H3N2 strain as well as influenza B. Other viruses that were detected this season were RSV, HRV, HBoV, HCoV, and MPV. The present study shows that it may not be possible to distinguish between influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illnesses based on symptoms alone, since all the respiratory pathogens evaluated have the potential to cause a febrile illness in affected children during the influenza season. Respiratory virus infections of early childhood are confined mostly to the upper respiratory tract resulting in common cold-like symptoms such as coryza, cough and sore throat. On the contrary, nearly onethird of infants with respiratory viral infections present with symptoms such as tachypnea, wheezing, severe cough, breathlessness, and respiratory distress, suggestive of lower respiratory tract involvement [Pavia, 2011] . In this study, 23% of patients who had a positive RT-PCR result had lower respiratory symptoms, whereas the most frequently encountered symptoms were cough (92.1%), rhinorrhea (92.1%), fever (84.3%), nasal congestion (83.3%), headache (25.3%), and myalgia (24.5%). The presence of a significant difference between viral pathogens in terms of frequency and duration of symptoms is also demonstrated. Fever and headache were observed more commonly in patients with infections due to the influenza viruses compared to other viruses, while the duration of symptoms such as fever, cough, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion was also significantly longer with influenza virus infections. In this group's recent study during the last influenza season [Ceyhan et al., 2012] , it was also observed that the duration of symptoms such as cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea in influenza positive patients were longer than those reported in the previous season, with no significant difference in the duration of fever. The conclusion shared by different studies is that on its own, clinical presentation should not be considered a reliable indicator of the causative viral pathogen.",

In a previous study from India, a similar pattern for influenza A and RSV has been observed [Agrawal et al., 2009 ]. An age distribution leaning toward a young age for RSV infections during winter may be attributed to an actual high incidence as well as increased parental awareness. It has long been established through several observational studies that the seasonal incidence of many respiratory viruses is influenced by weather conditions. The incidence of RSV infections has been found to be correlated inversely with average temperature, while a significant positive association between the incidence of HRV infections and increased humidity has also been reported [du Prel et al., 2009] . During the 5-month follow-up period in this study, influenza A cases were seen mostly in the months of December and January, with no further cases after February. On the other hand, the first case of influenza B was detected in January, with the number of new cases peaking in March.
