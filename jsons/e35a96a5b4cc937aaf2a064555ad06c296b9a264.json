Concomitantly, the last two decades have witnessed notable advances in the diagnosis and management of cancer patients including the use of high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. Although these strategies have significantly improved the overall and diseasefree survival rates of patients with cancer, they have also resulted in increasing numbers of patients being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for life-threatening toxic and infectious complications which are either cancer related or treatment associated. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the leading cause for ICU admission in cancer patients and usually associated with high mortality rates especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation [2] [3] [4] . The incidence of ARF is about 5% in patients with solid tumors and up to 50% in those with hematological malignancies. Among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients requiring MV and ICU admission, the incidence of ARF ranges from 42 to 88% with an overall survival rate of approximately only 15% in those receiving MV [5] .",

Diagnosis should be considered in any patient who develops cough, exertional dyspnea, and low-grade fever during or several months after chemotherapy. Pulmonary function tests usually reveal a restrictive defect with reduced diffusing capacity. Chest imaging shows patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacities or consolidations. Radiation recall pneumonitis can occur in patients with history of prior radiation to the chest. Chest imaging reveals pulmonary infiltrates in the same field as in the previous radiation therapy. Drugs commonly associated with radiation recall pneumonitis include doxorubicin, etoposide, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab [6] . Diagnostic procedures are performed to exclude other likely etiologies especially infections or recurrence or progression of tumor.

Pathogenesis involves production of local inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines and activation of cell adhesion molecules. The lung injury can manifest either as early acute phase (radiation pneumonitis) or a late phase (pulmonary fibrosis). Radiation pneumonitis occurs 1-3 months after radiotherapy and commonly presents with insidious onset of dyspnea, cough, and fever. Interstitial or alveolar infiltrates within the irradiated field are found on chest radiograph.

Clinical features include sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and hypoxemia. CT scan remains the gold standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of PE. Anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy are more challenging in cancer patients, because they have a higher risk of recurrent VTE than noncancer patients on one hand and a larger risk for bleeding complication on the other, especially in those with brain tumors or metastatic disease. Thus, treatment has to be individualized and based on overall goals of care. Low-molecular-weight heparins are preferred over unfractionated heparin for treating cancer patients with PE.

This strategy provides guidance for selecting empirical antimicrobial drugs and life-supporting interventions as well as other treatments and diagnostic investigations [7] . Rapid investigations and early identification of the cause of ARF have been shown to improve patient survival. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FB-BAL) is the diagnostic strategy of choice for cancer patients whose respiratory symptoms are not severe enough to warrant ICU admission. However, the procedure can be associated with many complications with decline in respiratory status requiring mechanical ventilation being the most dreaded. Moreover, the diagnostic yield with FB-BAL is only about 50% prompting interest in noninvasive strategies for identifying the cause of ARF [8] . The recent expansion of new noninvasive diagnostic tools as listed in Table 3 .2 requires reconsideration of the role of semi-invasive or invasive tests such as FB-BAL and lung biopsy.",

Noninfectious causes of ARF mostly fall into one of the following three categories: (a) acute or subacute nonspecific pulmonary infiltrates with severe hypoxemia in the initial phase of malignancies, especially hematological. Chest CT and other noninvasive tests can be helpful, but management entails rapid initiation of chemotherapy and broadspectrum antibiotics against community-acquired organisms. FB-BAL is necessary only if initial treatment fails. (b) Progressive, subacute, lung infiltrates in patients with recurrence of underlying cancer. Radiographic findings can reveal peribronchial and perivascular nodules suggestive of specific lesions or interlobular septal thickening resulting in prominent secondary pulmonary lobules manifesting as tessellating polygons suggestive of carcinomatosis. Transbronchial biopsy is really helpful in this situation. (c) Acute respiratory failure in patients receiving consolidation therapy for hematological malignancies. Chest imaging reveals diffuse interstitial infiltrates characterized by a diffuse ground-glass appearance. FB-BAL is essential to rule out opportunistic infections before chemotherapy-associated lung toxicity is considered. Lung biopsy has a role to play in this group of patients.",

Factors associated with higher mortality include, but not limited to, documented invasive aspergillosis, lack of definitive diagnosis, use of vasopressors, first-line conventional MV, conventional MV after NIPPV failure, and late NIPPV. Physicians should assist all cancer patients and their families to make informed decisions regarding the use of MV and other life-sustaining treatments in the ICU and to complete advance directives. End-of-life discussions have been shown to be associated with increased family satisfaction, less aggressive medical care near death, and earlier hospice referrals. In contrast, aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse bereavement adjustment. Ethics and palliative care consultations also greatly benefit end-of-life discussions with family members of cancer patients dying in the ICU [10] .",

A detailed clinical history and thorough physical examination are the first step to identify the cause of ARF in cancer patients. 3. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage has a diagnostic yield of only about 50% in cancer patients with ARF. Noninvasive strategies such as respiratory virus PCR testing, sputum and blood cultures, urine and serum tests, echocardiography, and chest imaging are often useful. 4. Corticosteroids are often used for patients with chemotherapy-induced lung injury and radiation pneumonitis. 5. Management of ARF includes supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia, early initiation of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia, diuretics to decrease pulmonary congestion, early use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in selected cases, and lung-protective ventilatory support for ARDS.",
