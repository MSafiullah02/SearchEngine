These viruses can be new (i.e., not previously known) or already known; however, they share the common characteristic of occupying and spreading within new niches. Factors driving the emergence of plant viruses include genetic variability in the virus, changes in agricultural practices, increases in the population and/or distribution of insect vectors and long-distance transport of plant materials. In recent years, individual as well as entire groups of viruses have emerged, and this has involved a variety of mechanism(s), depending on the virus and the environment. Here, we will discuss some of these viruses, and highlight the mechanisms that have mediated their emergence. Special emphasis is placed upon the whiteflytransmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) and the thrips-transmitted tosposviruses, which have emerged as major threats to crop production throughout the world. Other examples include the recent emergence of novel viruslike agents, the acquisition and role of satellite DNA or RNA molecules in emergence of plant viruses, and cases where emerging viruses have had only a transient impact. It seems clear that global movement of plant materials, expansion of agriculture and large-scale monoculture will continue to favor emergence of plant viruses. However, improved diagnostics should allow for rapid identification of emerging viruses and better understanding of viral biology. This information can be used in the development of effective management strategies, which will hopefully minimize impact on agricultural production.",

Some of these viruses have already greatly impacted human health, whereas others have caused catastrophic losses to crop and animal production. There are many definitions of what constitutes an emerging virus. We consider an emerging virus to be one that has recently changed or appeared to occupy and spread within a new niche. Emerging viruses can be new, i.e., not previously known; however, they are often known viruses that have become more apparent owing to changes in the environment/ecosystem and/or generation of a new variant, thereby providing the virus with an opportunity to expand into new niches. In the case of plant viruses, changes in agricultural practices and long-distance transport of plant materials are key factors mediating virus emergence. Some emerging viruses gain considerable public recognition and attention because of actual or potential health or economic losses, e.g., development of animal or human diseases or economic losses due to disease epidemics in crop plants. In other cases, the emergence of a virus or group of viruses may not result in catastrophic disease or economic losses.",

            "text": "Viruses that have emerged as animal or human pathogens are usually much more highly publicized than are emergent viruses of plants. However, the rate of emergence of plant viruses does not seem to be any less than that for human and other animal viruses. Furthermore, some common mechanisms underlie the emergence of animal and plant viruses, irrespective of the nature of the host. For example, an increasingly important mechanism is inadvertent long-distance transport of viruses, which is mediated by increased global movement of plants and people. Another common mechanism is the capacity of viruses to jump from reservoir hosts into new hosts; these viruses can cause serious diseases in their new hosts, in great part owing to the lack of adaptation that tends to moderate the toll that the virus imparts on the host. Examples of emergent human viruses thought to have come from animal reservoirs include Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thought to have emerged from a progenitor virus in chimpanzees (Gao et al. 1999) ; the novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), thought to have emerged from an animal reservoir (Guan et al. 2003) ; and the hemorrhagic viruses Ebola and Marburg (Leroy et al. 2005; Towner et al. 2006) . Following the introduction into humans, emergence of all three of these viruses, especially HIV, also was facilitated by long-distance transport of humans (or monkeys in the case of Marburg virus). Human and other animal viruses also can be introduced via insect vectors, and the emergence of the West Nile virus in the USA is an example of an Old World virus that was introduced into the New World, with subsequent spread into bird, animal and human hosts mediated by indigenous mosquito vectors (Lanciotti et al. 1999) .",

            "text": "A new viral disease of tomato appeared in greenhouse-produced tomatoes in the Netherlands in 1999. The symptoms of this disease were variable, but included various degrees of mosaic (including a bright yellow mosaic) in leaves, distorted leaf growth and mottling in fruits. In some cases, plants would senesce prematurely and take on a grayish appearance (referred to as \"thistletop\"), whereas in other cases (conditions favorable for plant growth) plants would be symptomless. The causal agent was identified as PepMV, a member of the genus Potexvirus, plussense single-stranded RNA viruses with flexous rod-shaped virions. PepMV was not a new virus; it was first identified in Peru in 1974 infecting pepino (Solanum muricatum), a local solanaceous plant with a sweet-tasting fruit. Shortly after its identification in the Netherlands, the disease began to appear throughout Europe (e.g., France, Italy, Spain and the UK). In 2001, it was reported from the USA, where it has been increasing in incidence ever since. The disease is not particularly devastating to tomato production, causing losses of approximately 5-15%, much of which is due to reduced fruit quality. However, the virus is rapidly spread via mechanical means (i.e., touch, pollination, grafting and pruning) and it is extremely persistent owing to the stability of the virions. Thus, PepMV clearly fits the definition of an emergent virus. One of the big questions was how did PepMV move from South America to Europe. Analysis of the nature of the initial outbreaks of the disease revealed an association with certain seed lots. Subsequent studies provided evidence of the association of the virus with seed, although at low levels and probably as an external contaminant. However, given how rapidly the virus can spread, plant-to-plant, it would not require high rates of seed contamination for the virus to become established in a tomato production system. Another factor that probably played a role in the emergence of PepMV is the practice of producing hybrid tomato seeds in countries such as Peru, which have favorable weather conditions and low labor costs. Thus, it is possible that PepMV was carried into Europe on hybrid tomato seed produced in Peru. If this were the case, then it would be expected that isolates of the virus from Peru, Europe and North America would be closely related. Indeed, studies of the population genetics of PepMV revealed high levels of nucleotide sequence similarity among tomato-infecting isolates from Peru, Europe and North America; consistent with emergence of a single genetic type (Verhoeven et al. 2003; Pagan et al. 2006 ). On the other hand, strains of the virus differing in genetic and biological properties (e.g., capacity to induce symptoms in tomato) also have been identified in Europe and elsewhere. There is evidence that these strains also may have originated from Peru, suggesting multiple introduction events into Europe. Finally, mixed infections of PepMV strains were detected in Spain, and recombinant isolates were detected (Pagan et al. 2006 ). Management of PepMV will require use of pathogen-free seed (facilitated by development of effective seed treatments or seed assays) and strict sanitation in tomato greenhouses; development of PepMV-resistant tomato varieties should be a long-term goal.",

            "text": "Tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) was first described in the Middle East around 1940 (Cohen and Antignus 1994) . In 1991, an isolate of the causal begomovirus, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), from Israel was characterized and shown to possess a monopartite genome (Navot et al. 1991) . Evidence that this single DNA component comprised the viral genome came from the development of TYLCD following introduction of the viral DNA into tomato plants via agroinoculation, a method where the plant pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens is used to deliver the viral DNA instead of the whitefly vector (Bemisia tabaci). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the genome organization of TYLCV was similar to that of the DNA-A component of the bipartite begomoviruses, but with an extra open reading frame (ORF) on the virion-sense DNA strand (V1 ORF). With use of the cloned viral DNA as a probe and the sequence to generate TYLCVspecific PCR primers, TYLCV was found distributed throughout the Middle East (e.g., Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Cyprus). Now, over 15 years since the characterization of this TYLCV isolate (TYLCV-IL, now considered as the \"type\" isolate), this virus has spread to the New World, where it has emerged as a major constraint on tomato production. Here, we examine how this has happened. TYLCV-IL was introduced into the Dominican Republic in the early 1990s (Salati et al. 2002) . The identification of TYLCV in this Caribbean island country was the first report of the emergence of an Old World monopartite begomovirus in the New World. TYLCV, like all geminiviruses, is not seed-transmitted, and the whitefly vector is not capable of transcontinental flight. Thus, it was not surprising that anecdotal reports indicated that tomato transplants had been imported into the Dominican Republic from Israel in the early 1990s, owing to destruction of local transplants by heavy rains. Unfortunately, this inadvertent introduction was all TYLCV needed to gain a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. The Dominican Republic was well suited for the establishment of TYLCV: hot dry weather, overlapping crops of susceptible tomato varieties and large populations of the whitefly vector.",

In 1999, TYLCV was first reported in the USA from Florida, where it was discovered in tomato plants sold at retail stores. The inoculum source was hypothesized to be viruliferous whiteflies blown into Florida via high winds (Polston et al. 1999 ). Subsequently, TYLCV was reported from Georgia, Louisiana and even from North Carolina. More recently, TYLCV has emerged in northern Mexico (the states of Sinaloa and Tamulipas), where it caused major losses to fresh and processing tomato production in the state of Sinaloa during the 2005-2006 growing season (Brown and Idris 2006) . The virus was subsequently identified in Texas and Arizona at the end of the 2006 growing season and, in March 2007 it was first identified in California .

While the factors mediating the rapid spread of this damaging pathogen in the Western Hemisphere are not completely understood, it is likely that it reflects a combination of migratory movements of the whitefly vector, together with movement of infected tomato transplants and/or other plants that are infected with TYLCV or harbor viruliferous whiteflies.

Another factor that has contributed to the emergence of these viruses is the apparent availability of a pool of progenitor viral genetic information present in reservoir hosts (e.g., weed or native plants). Finally, the interaction of these vector-virus combinations is mediated by increasing land conversion and intensification of agricultural production, e.g., through the use of new high-yielding varieties, improvements in irrigation and irrigation technology (especially drip irrigation), and increased use of pesticides and fertilizers (Matson et al. 1997) . Indeed, it is often at the interface of land conversion/agricultural intensification where emergence of new viruses commonly occurs.",

Thus, the tospoviruses qualify as a group of emergent viruses on the basis of the fact that new species are being described from a range of host plants in a diversity of geographical locations (Prins and Goldbach 1998; Whitfield et al. 2005) . This proliferation has been correlated with tremendous increases in thrips populations, especially the polyphagous WFT, which has been mediated by agricultural intensification (Prins and Goldbach 1998) . In the case of thrips, overuse or reliance on a few insecticides has also led to the generation of insecticide-resistant populations. Together with the difficultly of applying insecticides to flowers and other places where thrips feed and reproduce, this has limited the effectiveness of vector control for management of these tospovirus diseases. Most of the new tospovirus species have originated in tropical regions of Asia, perhaps suggesting a \"hot spot\" of viral genetic diversity in reservoir hosts. However, two species are emerging as significant economic threats in temperate North America: Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) and Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV). INSV was first discovered as a virus affecting ornamental plants in greenhouses. It has become widely distributed in the USA, presumably via the movement of infected ornamental plants and/or in viruliferous thrips carried on ornamentals (Daughtrey et al. 1997) . Thus, INSV has emerged as an important virus in the ornamental plant industry. More recently, INSV has been reported causing diseases in a number of crop plants. For example, INSV was identified as the cause of tomato spotted wilt-like symptoms in peppers in Georgia and lettuce in California (Naidu et al. 2005 ; Koike, Kuo and Gilbertson, unpublished data) . It remains to be seen whether INSV will become an emergent virus of vegetable crops. The availability of rapid detection methods such as immunostrips for TSWV and INSV will greatly facilitate identification and monitoring of these tospoviruses.",

Though a significant pest in its own right, it has mediated the emergence of the begomoviruses and the criniviruses over the past 20 years. Over the past 20 years, B. tabaci (biotype B as well as other biotypes) has mediated the emergence of well over 100 new begomovirus species. This has resulted in the whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses supplanting potyviruses as the group of plant viruses with the largest number of recognized viral species.

This occurs as whiteflies introduce genetically diverse progenitor begomoviruses, existing in reservoir hosts in these geographically distinct regions, into widely grown susceptible crops (e.g., common bean, cotton, cucurbits, peppers and tomato). This results in the simultaneous or parallel evolution of new crop-infecting begomovirus species in multiple locations.

It has been established that two genetically distinct lineages of begomoviruses emerged in South America (Brazil) and Mesoamerica, each of which causes the disease bean golden mosaic (Gilbertson et al. 1993a) . Evidence that viruses representing these two lineages are genetically distinct includes sequence divergence (approximately 80% identity), inability to generate infectious reassortants, and differences in sap transmissibility and germ plasm susceptibility. On the basis of these differences, viruses representing these lineages were named Bean golden mosaic virus (the initially described virus from Brazil) and Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (a cluster of related Mesoamerican viruses). This diversity can complicate breeding for disease resistance and deployment of resistant varieties (i.e., when a variety has resistance against only a subset of the viruses that cause the same or similar symptoms). A similar situation has since been described for begomoviruses associated with other diseases, including African cassava mosaic, cotton leaf curl and tomato leaf curl (Varma and Malathi 2003) . This situation has undoubtedly been facilitated by the emergence of the polyphagous B. tabaci biotype B, which feeds on a wide range of plants and, thus, would have a higher probability to acquire, mix and deliver a diversity of begomovirus components into potential new hosts.",

            "text": "In terms of viral evolution, it is widely held that geminiviruses are at a disadvantage when compared with their RNA virus counterparts because of the lower frequency of mutations introduced during replication of the viral genome. However, it is now clear that geminiviruses have made up for this deficiency, if it exists, through reassortment and recombination (Padadim et al. 1999; Rojas et al. 2005 ). In the geminiviruses, recombination is facilitated by a type of rolling circle replication referred to as recombination-dependent replication, which favors recombination and generates a diversity of viral DNA forms (Preiss and Jeske 2003) . Initial evidence for recombination in bipartite begomoviruses came from studies in which deleterious mutations were repaired by replacement with wild-type DNA sequences from the same species (Roberts and Stanley 1994) . It was further hypothesized that the bipartite genome might facilitate recombination between components, even among distinct viral species. However, initial studies showed a limited capacity for reassortment among components of begomoviral species, owing to the specificity of the replication-associated (Rep) protein for the cognate origin of replication [common region (CR) of the components of a bipartite begomovirus]. The formation of infectious reassortants between the cloned DNA components of closely related bipartite begomovirus species Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) and Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV) suggested that specificity of the Rep protein was less stringent than initially thought (Gilbertson et al. 1993b) . Additional reports confirmed these findings, and revealed that reassortment was common among closely related begomoviruses; this even was reported to occur between distantly related bipartite begomoviruses (i.e., from different phylogenetic clades; Garrido-Ramirez et al. 2000) .",

This allowed the emergence of a fitter bipartite begomovirus, in large part due to the increased replication of the BDMV DNA-B (Hou and Gilbertson 1996) . The question remained about the relative importance of these mechanisms in nature. Compelling evidence for a role of CR exchange in begomovirus evolution in nature came from a study of cassava-infecting begomoviruses in India. Here, a new bipartite begomovirus, Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV), was identified that appeared to have emerged from a monopartite begomovirus (SLCMV) that acquired a DNA-B component from another bipartite begomovirus (Indian cassava mosaic virus) by CR exchange (Saunders et al. 2002) .",

The virus either lacks a factor needed for effective colonization of these non-tomato hosts, or the hosts possess some defense factor(s) or response(s) that prevents efficient infection.

The recombinant portion of the genome included the intergenic region and the 5\u2032 end of the C1 ORF, which encodes the Rep protein. Subsequently, epidemics of TYLCD in southern Italy in the late 1980s were shown to be caused by a distinct begomovirus species (less than 80% identical to TYLCV), and it was named Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV).

This recombinant, named TYLCMalV, was hypothesized to have emerged because of a selective advantage over the parental viruses in terms of a wider host range, more efficient whitefly transmission and being more infectious in TYLCV-resistant tomato varieties (Monci et al. 2002) . Evidence for the selective advantage of this recombinant came from results of a study of the population structure of begomoviruses associated with TYLCD in southern Spain from 1999 to 2003 indicating that TYLCMalV had become established and had spread throughout this important tomato production region (Garcia-Andres et al. 2007 ). In addition, mixed infections of TYLCV were common, and a new type of recombinant, between the type strain of TYLCV and TYLCSV-ES, was detected. This clearly demonstrates how recombination can generate novel begomovirus forms that can allow for adaptation and expansion into new environments, and that can compete with existing viruses.",

This disease has long been known on the African continent, and causes significant economic losses to production of this staple crop. Multiple begomovirus species can cause CMD, and these likely arose via parallel evolution. On the basis of the biology of these viruses and the nature of cassava cultivation, management strategies were implemented, including use of virus-free propagative material, deployment of resistant varieties and roguing of infected plants. This approach seemed to keep the disease at manageable levels (Legg 1999) . However, in the 1980s the incidence and severity of CMD increased markedly in East Africa (Legg 1999; Legg and Fauquet 2004) . This was associated with the emergence of highly virulent forms via reassortment and recombination. For example, recombination between East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV) and African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), in which capsid protein (CP) gene sequences of ACMV were exchanged with homologous sequences in EACMV, has given rise to a highly virulent recombinant (EACMV-UG2) that has been implicated in these disease outbreaks. In addition, reassortment between other recombinant EACMV components has led to the emergence of other highly virulent forms in other parts of southeast Africa (Pita et al. 2001 ). Together with increases in whitefly populations on cassava, these emerging viruses pose a major threat to cassava production on the African continent.",

However, when introduced back into the natural hosts, the cloned DNA component was infectious but induced symptoms that were much milder than those observed in plants in the field . This puzzling observation was explained following the identification of sub-virus-sized satellite DNAs (satDNAs) associated with these diseases. When these satDNAs were introduced into plants, together with their cognate monopartite begomovirus, the characteristic disease symptoms were induced. These satDNAs, also referred to as DNA-\u03b2s, are approximately 1.4 kb (about half the size of the begomovirus genome) and require the helper begomovirus for replication and movement. The satDNAs share no sequence similarity with the helper virus except a stem-loop structure (presumably the origin of replication), and have a single ORF (\u03b2C1). The \u03b2C1 protein is a symptom determinant, as an intact bC1 gene is required for satDNA to mediate symptom development, and expression of \u03b2C1 in transgenic plants results in a symptomatic phenotype (Saunders et al. 2004; Saeed et al. 2005) .",

This promiscuity has revealed more flexibility in Rep-protein-mediated replication than had been previously thought. Moreover, the capacity to be replicated by multiple begomoviruses means that satDNAs can form complexes with multiple monopartite begomoviruses, thereby allowing these viruses to increase their incidence and/or host range. Thus, it is clear that there is a strong selective advantage for monopartite begomoviruses to \"partner\" with a satDNA, and that this has had a major impact on the emergence of the begomoviruses in the Old World.",

In contrast to the begomovirus satDNA, the CMV satRNA are linear single-stranded RNAs, apparently do not encode for any proteins, and usually attenuate symptoms induced by the helper virus (Simon et al. 2004 ). However, certain CMV satRNAs increase disease symptoms, inducing either necrosis or chlorosis. The induction of necrosis has been shown to be associated with the initiation of programmed cell death mediated by the satRNA minus-strand (Simon et al. 2004 ). The origins of begomovirus satDNAs and CMV satRNAs remain a mystery; however, whereas the begomovirus satDNAs are commonly found in nature, the CMV satRNAs tend to be found in experimental systems. Thus, the begomovirus/satDNA combination is a synergistic interaction, whereas the CMV/satRNA interaction seems to reflect a situation where the satRNA is a parasite of the virus.",

The symptoms of these diseases appear similar to those induced by the tospovirus TSWV; however, tests for known tomato-infecting viruses have given negative results. The diseases are also graft-and sap-transmissible, consistent with a viral etiology. It was reported recently that the torrado disease is caused by a novel plant picorna-like virus, most closely related to single-stranded RNA viruses in the genera Sequivirus, Sadwavirus and Cheravirus. The name proposed for this virus is Tomato torrado virus (Verbeek et al. 2007 ). It is not clear whether the necrosis-associated diseases in Guatemala and Mexico are caused by Tomato torrado virus or some other virus. It is also not clear what the vector(s) of these agents is. If these diseases turn out to be caused by the same or closely related viruses, their recent emergence in New and Old World locations may suggest a long-distance transport mechanism, e.g., in association with seeds or propagative materials.",

Analyses of genetic diversity among CYSDV strains from different regions, as well as from a single region over an 8-year period, revealed a relatively homogenous population (Marco and Aranda 2005) .

Massive outbreaks of whiteflies followed the introduction of this exotic insect (Perring et al. 1991; Toscano et al. 1998) , and the B biotype quickly displaced the indigenous A biotype. These outbreaks resulted in crop losses owing to the sheer magnitude of the whitefly populations and their feeding-induced physiological abnormalities (e.g., irregular ripening of tomato and silverleaf of squash). Another big concern was that the insects would increase the incidence/severity of existing viruses and/or facilitate the emergence of new virus diseases. Unexpectedly, the incidence of LIYV decreased dramatically, and the infectious yellows disease essentially disappeared from the Imperial Valley. Whitefly transmission experiments, conducted with B. tabaci biotypes A and B provided the explanation: B. tabaci biotype B was an inefficient vector of LIYV.

The B biotype is a known vector of begomoviruses, although it is generally a less efficient vector than the A biotype. However, the apparent reduced vectoring efficiency is compensated for by the biotype B feeding on a wider range of host plants and having a higher rate of reproduction. Thus, it was feared that the high populations of biotype B whiteflies would lead to the emergence of new begomoviruses. This could occur by introducing variants of indigenous weed-infecting begomoviruses into crop plants or mixtures of begomoviral components, resulting in the evolution of a new emergent crop-infecting virus via reassortment and recombination. This latter scenario has been proposed to explain the evolution of CLCrV (Idris and Brown 2004; Seo et al. 2006 ). However, this scenario has yet to unfold in the Imperial Valley, almost 20 years since the introduction of biotype B. Thus, the incidence of SLCV and CLCrV did not change significantly, nor did new crop-infecting begomoviruses emerge to threaten agricultural production. The fact that SLCV and CLCrV still appear, to some extent, every year, taken together with the subsequent introduction of CYSDV and TYLCV, indicates that the failure to observe the emergence of new begomoviruses was not due to an inability of the B biotype whiteflies to transmit viruses. More likely this reflects a limited genetic pool of indigenous viruses in this desert region (as compared with a tropical agroecosystem), or perhaps a lack of extensive cultivation of highly susceptible begomovirus hosts (e.g., tomato, pepper and common bean). Thus, the Imperial Valley agroecosystem appeared to lack a component necessary for the rapid and widespread emergence of new begomoviruses.",

However, while tests confirmed begomovirus infection in these plants, sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified fragments of the virus genome revealed only approximately 85% sequence identity with SLCV, the most closely related previously characterized begomovirus. Subsequent cloning and sequencing of the DNA-A and DNA-B components of this begomovirus established that it was a new species, and it was named Cucurbit leaf crumple virus (CuLCrV; Guzman et al. 2000) . Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that CuLCrV was a distinct begomovirus species in the SLCV cluster of New World bipartite begomoviruses. The close relationship of CuLCrV and SLCV was further demonstrated by the finding that infectious reassortants could be generated between the cloned DNA components of these viruses (Brown et al. 2002) . Thus, while the source of CuLCrV remains unknown, it is thought to have evolved from a progenitor begomovirus infecting an indigenous host plant that is distributed outside the cultivated lands of the Imperial Valley. A similar progenitor virus may have given rise to SLCV over 20 years earlier. This hypothesis could be tested by surveying weeds and other indigenous hosts (symptomatic and symptomless) for the presence of begomovirus infection by PCR with degenerate begomovirus primers (Rojas et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "In the years following its identification, CuLCrV emerged as the cause of leaf crumpling, curling and chlorosis symptoms in cantaloupe, watermelon and squash in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys of California, southern Arizona and northern Mexico. Therefore, CuLCrV represents the first emergent begomovirus that has appeared in the desert southwest following the outbreaks of whitefly biotype B. In the case of squash, the virus caused in the Coachella valley economic losses. However, observation of CuLCr disease development in cantaloupe and watermelon revealed that, while severe symptoms initially developed in infected plants, symptoms eventually became markedly attenuated as the plants continued to grow. Eventually, plants showed few or no symptoms and fields with affected plants provided acceptable yields. This \"recovery from infection\" occurred in cantaloupe and watermelon, but not in squash or pumpkin. It also was consistently reproduced in the laboratory. Analysis of recovered tissue revealed a considerable reduction of viral titer compared with nonrecovered symptomatic tissues, high rates of methylation of viral DNA and the presence of small CuLCrV-derived RNAs. Furthermore, reinoculation of recovered tissue with CuLCrV failed to result in symptom development, whereas inoculation of recovered tissues with CMV led to the return of severe symptoms and increased CuLCrV titers. This latter result suggests that the 2b silencing suppressor of CMV may have interfered with the host defense mechanism that attenuated symptoms of CuLCrV. Taken together, these results indicate that cantaloupe and watermelon stage a vigorous defense response against CuLCrV infection involving virus-induced gene silencing. Thus, though CuLCrV is a new emergent virus, the major economic hosts of the virus in the Imperial Valley mount a vigorous defense response, limiting the economic importance of the virus.",

            "text": "Over the past 10-20 years, groups of plant viruses as well as individual viruses have emerged as significant constraints on crop production worldwide. This emergence can involve a range of mechanisms (Table 3 .1), depending on the virus(es) involved and the environment. Existing viruses can be moved long distances via human activities, allowing for subsequent establishment and spread in compatible agroecosystems. Irrespective of whether the virus has a DNA or an RNA genome, mechanisms of variability such as mutation, reassortment and recombination allow for the generation of new forms of existing viruses that have the potential to emerge as important pathogens. This is facilitated by new selection pressures placed on the viral population, such as those associated with modifications of existing agroecosystems. However, the rate at which such variants are generated and their economic impact is a function of multiple factors (efficiency of vector transmission, the existing pool of viral genetic variability in a region, nature of the host, aspects of the agroecosystem, etc.). Novel viruses or viruslike entities can also emerge, and these often appear at interfaces of agricultural and undeveloped lands. In the case of plant viruses, emergence of variants of known viruses or novel agents is greatly facilitated by increases or emergence of insect vector populations. Entire groups of viruses (e.g., the begomoviruses, criniviruses and tospoviruses) have emerged following the worldwide emergence of their insect vectors. Moreover, given the continued global movement of plant materials and seeds, expansion of agriculture into new areas, and the propensity of large-scale commercial agriculture to favor development of large populations of insect pests, it is highly likely that new plant viruses will continue to emerge.",

            "text": "The challenge in dealing with emergence of new viruses is significant, but it has been lessened by improvements in technology and increased understanding of viral genetic diversity, ecology and genetics. Thus, with new detection technologies (PCR and sequencing and microarray-based technologies), potentially new emergent viruses can be identified sooner. However, identification of novel viruses can still be very challenging, and often requires a combination of new technology and innovative approaches. Once an emerging plant virus has been identified, effective detection tools need to be developed and applied to answer questions about the biology of the virus. This information can then be used to develop effective management strategies. Ideally, multiple approaches will lead to development of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. Such an approach has led to the effective management of the emergent TYLCV in the Dominican Republic, and tomato production has actually increased since the introduction of the virus (Salati et al. 2002) . Similar management approaches are now being brought to bear on begomovirus diseases of tomato in West Africa and Central America. Thus, it is hoped that the use of IPM strategies, tailor-made for emergent viruses based on understanding of the biology of the virus, will minimize the impact of these viruses on world food production.",
