Lawsonia intracellularis, the etiologic agent of PE, is an obligate intracellular pathogen that replicates in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells. This infection results in crypt hyperplasia, decreased numbers of goblet cells, and compromised feed digestion that leads to poor weight gain in affected pigs (Vannucci et al., 2019). The mechanisms involved in the intestinal epithelium changes caused by L. intracellularis infection are still unclear.",

Despite the efficacy of the commercial vaccines, some producers are still resistant to the incorporation of this strategy in their herds, and rely on antimicrobial therapy, in feed, water, or individually administrated, to prevent and control PE (Holyoake et al., 2009; Resende et al., 2015). Most of the current investigations of alternatives to antimicrobial treatment of PE are not strategically designed toward specific targets due to the lack of understating of PE pathogenesis. Lawsonia intracellularis is the only species in the genus and the lack of information regarding its virulence factors has limited the development of alternative prevention and control methods (Vannucci and Gebhart, 2014).",

Although single cell cultures are routinely used for laboratory propagation of L. intracellularis, they fail in reproducing the cellular changes observed in the intestinal epithelium of PE-affected pigs (Resende et al., 2019b). Although mice are not a natural host for L. intracellularis infection, we recently evaluated three-dimensional mouse enteroids as an in vitro model for L. intracellularis pathogenesis. However, despite the organotypic similarity offered by the model, mouse enteroids were an inadequate model since L. intracellularis did not significantly propagate or produce detectable changes in the host cells (Resende et al., 2019a). Therefore, an adequate in vitro model for the investigation of L. intracellularis pathogenesis is still needed.",

Enteroids can be cultured as three-dimensional structures composed of intestinal epithelial cells which can be polarized with the apical membrane forming a sphere-like system with the center acting as intestinal lumen where cell debris are shed, and metabolites are secreted (Sato and Clevers, 2013; Yin et al., 2019). This three-dimensional structure makes it necessary to use microinjection systems to add the treatments into the enteroid lumen, which is time consuming, laborious and makes control of dosing and exposure variable between enteroids (Wilson et al., 2015; Resende et al., 2019a), Alternatively, enteroids can be cultured as two-dimensional enteroids by using transwells. Enteroids cultured this way still contain all types of intestinal epithelial cells present in the intestine, with the advantage of having an easy-access cell apical membrane, which simplifies the infection process and analyses (Braverman and Yilmaz, 2018; Thorne et al., 2018). The objective of this study was to evaluate two-dimensional swine enteroids as in vitro models for L. intracellularis infection.",

A 3\u20134 cm ileum piece was excised and placed in ice-cold Advanced Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco Advanced DMEM, ThermoFisher) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, ThermoFisher), then transferred to a Petri dish containing ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and opened longitudinally. After three washes in PBS, the tissue was transferred into calcium and magnesium-free Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) containing 30 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Corning, ThermoFisher), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), and 100 \u00b5g/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 5\u201315 min. After incubation, crypts were separated by applying suction using a disposable transfer pipette, which was continued until abundant crypts were observed in the suspension by visual evaluation in an inverted microscope. The crypt suspension was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and washed with advanced DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning 35011CV, heat inactivated). The tube was centrifuged for 4 min at low speed (300 \u00d7 g) and the supernatant media was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and centrifuged for 4 min at low speed (300 \u00d7 g). The supernatant media was aspirated, and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL of Intesticult organoid media (StemCell Technology). Crypt density was counted by placing 40 \u00b5L of the suspension on a slide and media volume adjusted to have 20\u201330 crypts / 40 \u00b5L. The crypt suspension was suspended in Matrigel (Corning) at a 1:3 ratio, and placed as beads in a 24-well culture plate which was then incubated for 15\u201320 min at 37 \u00b0C for the Matrigel to gelatinize. Once gelatinized, the wells were covered with 400 \u00b5L of Intesticult and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Intesticult media was replaced every 48 h to grow three-dimensional enteroids.",

Ct values were converted to L. intracellularis organisms/mL, obtaining 1.99 \u00d7 103L. intracellularis/mL for experiment 1 (E1), 9.72 \u00d7 102L. intracellularis/mL for E2, 1.04 \u00d7 107L. intracellularis/mL for E3, and 5.49 \u00d7 104L. intracellularis/mL for E4. In each independent experiment, wells were infected with L. intracellularis suspension, or exposed to the medium used to suspend the inoculum only as negative controls. One set of wells was harvested at 3 days postinfection (dpi) and another set was harvested at 7 dpi. The enteroid media collected from the top of the transwell at 3 and 7 dpi was saved for L. intracellularis real-time PCR. The set of transwells to be harvested at 7 dpi had its media replaced at 5 dpi, with the used media also being saved for L. intracellularis real-time PCR. This procedure resulted in three samples for L. intracellularis real-time PCR (3, 5, and 7 dpi) for each independent experiment as described elsewhere (Wattanaphansak et al., 2010).",

Future experiments will also account for this variable and will include transwells infected with L. intracellularis for longer than 14 days. Based on the results presented here, we defined that enteroids should be infected with L. intracellularis inocula at a concentration of about 107L. intracellularis organisms/mL. Further analysis of the impact of L. intracellularis infection on the epithelial cell distribution and proliferation are needed. Long term, L. intracellularis infection of swine enteroids can be exploited in several ways such as to study 1) early host\u2013pathogen events (endocytic process of L. intracellularis in intestinal epithelial cells); 2) phenotypic identification of the primary epithelial cells infected by L. intracellularis; 3) gene editing in swine enteroids to investigate the signaling pathways involved in L. intracellularis-induced proliferation; and 4) route of neighbor-cell infection during L. intracellularis propagation.",
