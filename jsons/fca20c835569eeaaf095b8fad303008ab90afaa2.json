C. perfringens was identified in 83.5 and 85.4% of cat and dog faeces, respectively, as both singular and dual organism presence. The high prevalence of C. perfringens in healthy animals is a major limitation of faecal PCR assays, particularly those assays such as the assay used here, that target the alpha-toxin gene. The alpha-toxin gene is of questionable virulence and is present in all C. perfringens strains. The pathogen that was detected as a co-infection in 67.2% and 48% of cats and dogs, respectively, may represent a secondary or commensal carriage as the PCR is not specific for clostridial enteropathy. Combining C. perfringens enterotoxin detection by ELISA with PCR detection of enterotoxogenic strains is currently recommended to facilitate the diagnosis of C. perfringens-associated diarrhoea. 4 A study of feline shelters in California, USA identified the prevalence of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by faecal floatation, immunoassay and direct immunofluorescence as 9.8% and 4.7%, respectively, in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic cats. 5 Faecal PCR in diarrhoeic cats has previously been reported to demonstrate Giardia spp. in 20.6%, and in a study of diarrhoeic dogs with faecal PCR, a prevalence of 13.5% was found. 1,2 Giardia spp. was detected in 6.2% and 11.1% of diarrhoeic dogs and cats, respectively, in this study. Cryptosporidium spp. was not detected in any sample. This may reflect an absence of infection, the effect of antigenic diversity on the performance of the assay or a lack of sensitivity to detect Cryptosporidium felis or Cryptosporidium canis that infects dogs and cats. 6 The collection method of the faeces is unknown, and if a combined sample or increased sample numbers are assessed, the predictive value of the test increases, which has unknown impact on the results of this study. 5, 7 Giardia spp. is considered a potential zoonotic pathogen and is therefore of public health interest. It was detected in 6.2% of cats, of which 13 of 18 with known ages were <1 year old, and 11.1% of dogs (5 weeks 5 days to 4 years 2 months, median 6 months). This is similar to a meta-analysis of 15.2% and 12% in dogs and cats, respectively, and is less than a UK study that detected 20.6% prevalence through a faecal PCR. 2, 8 While direct immunofluorescent coproscopy has been adopted as the gold standard for identifying faecal Giardia cysts, immunoassays have been developed to detect excreted Giardia antigen with generally poor positive predictive value, possibly in part due to variable faecal shedding. 9 In people, comparison of microscopy, ELISA and real-time PCR for the detection of Giardia intestinalis in faecal specimens has been assessed, with an RT-PCR (79.8%) much more sensitive and beneficial for rapid and accurate diagnosis compared to ELISA (46.8%). 10 Considering the zoonotic potential of this pathogen, further assessment of the faecal PCR compared to other techniques would seem prudent to determine if more rapid identification, and thus environmental control measures, could be performed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 136, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1522, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2082, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2297, "end": 2299, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2301, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2728, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2729, "end": 2730, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3015, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3276, "end": 3278, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Coronavirus was found to have 39.5% prevalence in the cats tested, which is less than that observed in previous studies. A recent study in the United Kingdom reported a prevalence of 56.9% by faecal PCR in diarrhoeic cats. 2 Coronavirus was detected in 34% of pet cats (25 days to 16 years old, median 1 year old) and 43% of shelter cats. Faecal antigen can be shed for 2-10 months post-infection and is more prevalent in kittens and older cats as seen with the increased incidence in cats <1 year here. In addition, as cats with increased serological titres are more likely to shed faecal antigen than cats with reduced titres, the faecal PCR test may prove useful to identify infected cats and reduce transmission in the cattery/shelter environment. 11 CCV was detected in 4.7% of dogs and was mainly identified in younger dogs (range 6 weeks to 6 years, median 22 weeks). In 5 (26%) of 19 of these dogs, there was co-infection with CPV. Given that co-infection with CCV can potentially enhance the severity of CPV and hence the prognosis or prolong hospitalisation, the faecal PCR may provide important prognostic information. 12 Salmonella spp. was identified in 1.7% of feline and 5.4% of canine faeces, significantly lower than a previous study of cats in the UK, where Salmonella enterica had 20.6% prevalence through faecal PCR. 2 While the pathogen was isolated, this may reflect colonisation or carriage rather than infection. Its presence in healthy dogs and cats can be similar to those with diarrhoea. Furthermore, in animals that hunt and eat raw meat, there is more likely to be increased colonisation and shedding of Salmonella spp. The prevalence of Salmonella spp.in diarrhoeic dogs and cats ranges from 0% to 3.5% and from 0% to 8.6%, respectively, whereas the prevalence range for Salmonella spp. in stray or shelter dogs and cats is 0%-51.4%. 4 It was not identified in any dog or cat from a shelter in this study. It was only identified in young cats (range 14 weeks to 2 years and 10 months, median 1 year old), which may reflect a na\u00efve host immune response or a type II error given that only 289 samples were assessed. There was no age cluster in dogs, and it was detected in dogs aged 14 weeks to 15 years.
