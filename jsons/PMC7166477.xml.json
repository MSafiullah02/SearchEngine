Recognition of clinical features at an earlier stage of the infection and stringent isolation procedures could prevent outbreaks in institutions, but the presentation of SARS may be less florid in older people.\n2\n Nursing home residents, because of their frailty and comorbidities, are frequent users of hospital services, including emergency rooms (ERs) and acute wards, thus increasing their risk of exposure to infectious agents in hospitals. Demented or extremely frail patients may pose particular risk to other persons, because they may not be able to communicate and are only recognized after those who have come into contact with them fall ill. Also, cognitively impaired older patients may have difficulty keeping their facemasks on and sometimes exhibit high\u2010risk behavior such as spitting. We report a cluster of seven cases (Table 1) illustrating the spread of SARS from a hospital to the community and, in particular, a nursing home. All the cases were diagnosed clinically\n3\n and had positive viral isolates or serological tests to coronavirus.",

            "text": "The nursing home involved was typical of many privately run institutions of its type. Located in an old building, it was crowded, with an average living space of 6 m2 per resident. Individual beds were separated with wooden boards approximately 1.2 m high. The small communal toilet and shower area was near the living and dining area. Frailer residents usually used bedside urinals or commodes for toileting. No single room was available for isolation purposes. The staff\u2010to\u2010resident ratio was around 1:15, and the majority of carers had no formal training in health care.",

            "text": "This report illustrates how a single nursing home resident infected with SARS during hospitalization gave rise to several secondary cases, some resulting in death. During the SARS epidemic, nursing homes residents admitted to some acute hospitals with fever, but clinically not suspected to be suffering from SARS, would be transferred from a \u201cfever\u201d ward to a \u201ccohorting\u201d ward for about 10 days before returning to their nursing homes. Although such measures may have reduced the spread of the infection to nursing homes, they have, nevertheless, increased the workload of acute hospitals tremendously, and in some unfortunate instances, led to further in\u2010hospital outbreaks. Community\u2010based outreach teams including geriatricians and nurses were mobilized to closely monitor nursing home residents discharged from hospitals. They worked closely with the department of health and hospital wards to keep up\u2010to\u2010date information on nursing home residents afflicted with SARS. Advice was given to nursing home staff on the use of protective gear and provision of isolation facilities for residents with febrile illness and those recently discharged from hospitals to prevent cross\u2010infection. Perhaps the way to manage this in the future is to keep nursing home residents on\u2010site wherever possible, avoiding the need to come into contact with high\u2010risk areas such as the ER and hospital wards",
