Conversely, studies involving older hospitalized children1,5,13 consistently reported equivalent disease severity between respiratory illnesses caused by HRV/ENT and those caused by other common respiratory viruses. Explanations for the discrepancies observed among these studies4,12,13 include the use of different clinical criteria to assess clinical severity (clinical severity scores versus clinical outcomes) and the focus on different patient populations and age groups (inpatients and young children). Furthermore, the contribution of HRV/ENT infection versus host-related factors such as underlying immunosuppression to the severity of the disease was not reported in most studies.",

The results from the original study were recently published elsewhere.14 The dataset was augmented through retrospective chart review. Children with documented viral coinfections (i.e., detection of more than one viral pathogen in the same sample) were excluded as their inclusion would not allow single viral infection comparisons as a result of not being able to determine which of the viruses detected was the leading pathogen. Data were collected from November 2007 to April 2008 and January 2009 to March 2009, the times when multiplex PCR testing was routinely utilized in randomly selected patients under 18 years of age presenting with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). URTI was defined as the detection of any single respiratory viral infection together with symptoms involving the upper respiratory tract (nose and pharynx).15 LRTI was defined as any patient with cough, tachypnea, and/or any respiratory distress or wheezing. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was defined as any of the above LRTI symptoms with pulmonary infiltrates diagnosed on a chest X-ray by a radiologist. Severe clinical disease was defined by hospital admission for outpatients and by a composite endpoint including intensive care (ICU) admission, hospitalization >5 days, oxygen requirements or death in patients admitted to the hospital. Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children.",

Metabolic conditions included any inherited metabolic diseases such as cystinuria, phenylketonuria (PKU), gout, and thyroid disease. In case of multiple comorbidities, patients were referred to the group considered as the most significant comorbidity: an underlying immunocompromised/metabolic condition was considered most significant comorbidity, followed by a cardiorespiratory comorbidity.

Neither laboratory staff nor clinicians were aware in advance which patient would be selected for viral detection by molecular assays. Swabs were assayed by four different nucleic acid amplification-based assays: ResPlex II v2.0 (Qiagen); Seeplex RV15 kit (Seegene Inc.); xTAG-RVP and xTAG-RVP Fast (Luminex). These assays detect up to 18 respiratory viruses [RSV (A, B), coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1), rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/ENT), coxsackie/echovirus, PIV (1, 2, 3, 4), FLU-A, FLU-B, bocavirus (HBoV), ADV (A,B,C,D,F). and hMPV]. ResPlex II v2.0, and Seeplex RV15 assays distinguished single HRV infections from single ENT infections whereas xTAG-RVP and xTAG-RVP fast assays reported a combined result of HRV/ENT as reported in our study. These combined results did include coxsackie and echoviruses. All specimens were also examined by direct fluorescent antigen assay (DFA) for eight respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus [A,B] (FLU-A/FLU-B), parainfluenza [1\u20133] (PIV), adenovirus (ADV) (SimulFluor\u00ae; Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (Diagnostic HYBRIDS, Athens, OH, USA) and/or viral culture. We defined a viral result as a true positive if positive by viral culture regardless of other tests; if positive by DFA and at least one molecular test; or if positive by two different molecular tests. For those only detectable by molecular assays (HRV/ENT, coronaviruses, HBoV and PIV 4), a true positive result was defined as two or more positive test results from among the four molecular assays.14 Bacterial coinfection was defined as the presence of any bacterial pathogen, identified by culture from blood cultures or respiratory samples (bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions, sputum samples or pleural fluid) upon initial consultation with respiratory symptoms or within 30 days of their initial consultation. Staphylococcus epidermidis positive blood cultures were considered as pathogens if drawn from more than one peripheral blood culture, from one blood culture drawn from a central line, or from one peripheral line in high-risk patients such as those with underlying immunosuppressive conditions, prosthetic devices, or newborns according to recent guidelines.16 In addition, a positive urinary antigen for Streptococcus pneumonia retrieved upon admission or within 30 days of admission was also considered as bacterial coinfection. Positive bacterial urinary or stool cultures and bacterial pathogen identified from skin or wound swabs were not considered as bacterial coinfections.",

Furthermore, we found significantly longer duration of hospitalization among children admitted with HRV/ENT infections compared to those admitted with FLU infections. Also, higher rates of pneumonia were observed among children with single HRV/ENT infections compared to those with RSV single viral infections as suggested by a previous study by Malcolm et al.7 Finally, half of the deaths observed among the four HRV-/ENT-infected children with underlying conditions may have resulted from their HRV/ENT respiratory illnesses as no other viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens were documented. All these findings contrast with recently published studies1,5,13 which reported equivalent disease severity between subjects with HRV/ENT infections and those with other common viral infections. These studies, however, had major limitations, which may have resulted in not detecting a true difference. Firstly, the studies were conducted in inpatients only. One can speculate that hospitalized patients share a level of comorbidity leading to more similar outcomes regardless of the virus involved.24 Furthermore, most of these studies compared HRV/ENT infections to all other viruses combined and did not adjust for underlying comorbidities. While treatment of FLU-A-positive children with oseltamivir might have been expected to improve their prognosis, no children included in this study received oseltamivir, as specimens were collected before the implementation of guidelines advocating for oseltamivir treatment of high-risk children25 Thus, the difference in outcomes between HRV/ENT and treated FLU-A may be even more pronounced than found in our study.",

Furthermore, the adjustment for underlying comorbidities in multivariable analysis reinforced the association between HRV/ENT and clinical outcomes. Given our low rate of bacterial coinfections, no adjustment for this variable was made in multivariable analyses. Finally, we had adequate sample size to compare HRV/ENT to a number of different viruses. Potential limitations of our study relate to its retrospective design. However, we believe that most of our patient-related important outcomes could be well assessed though chart review. Similarly, the observational nature of our study may have led to selection bias as not all consecutive patients were tested for respiratory viruses as a result of limited resources. Random sampling ensured an unbiased selection of samples tested by molecular assays. Furthermore, the criteria for using virologic diagnostics as part of routine patient care may have varied during the study. For instance, viral culture was only routinely used from November 2007 to April 2008, which may have affected the comparisons of illness severity between different viruses. Third, we assessed the presence or absence of viruses, but did not measure their viral load; higher viral loads in acutely ill subjects compared with asymptomatic children might have further strengthened the association between HRV/ENT and severe disease as rhinoviruses are also commonly identified in community-based controls.6,26 Future research should measure viral loads and use sequencing for genotyping analysis to differentiate HRV from enterovirus and to speciate HRV. Recent studies suggest that human rhinovirus species A and C (HRV-A and HRV-C) may be associated with greater clinical severity compared with HRV-B species.27,25,28 Finally, our estimation of bacterial coinfection may have been underestimated as adequate respiratory samples such as BAL are rarely performed in children and pneumonia rarely result in positive blood cultures. Also, URT samples are not necessarily representative of LRT disease. This limitation inherent to studies assessing the severity of respiratory illnesses in children may be overcome in future prospective studies, conducted among children with specific underlying comorbidities (e.g., immunocompromised children), which would include validated molecular assays for detection of both viral and bacterial pathogens from URT samples in all children with ARTI.",
