Its mission is to identify and review international science and knowledge relevant to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) and when there is consensus to offer treatment recommendations.

When cardiac arrest or life-threatening emergencies occur, prompt and skillful response can make the difference between life and death and between intact survival and debilitation. This document summarises the 2010 evidence evaluation of published science about the recognition and response to sudden life-threatening events, particularly sudden cardiac arrest and peri-arrest events in victims of all ages. The broad range and number of topics reviewed necessitated succinctness in the consensus science statements and brevity in treatment recommendations. This supplement is not a comprehensive review of every aspect of resuscitation medicine; not all topics reviewed in 2005 were reviewed in 2010. This executive summary highlights the evidence evaluation and treatment recommendations of the 2010 evidence evaluation process.

Separate writing groups were formed to coordinate evidence evaluation for defibrillation and mechanical devices because these overlapped with both BLS and ALS. Each task force identified topics requiring evidence evaluation and invited international experts to review them. To ensure a consistent and thorough approach, a worksheet template was created with step-by-step directions to help the experts document their literature reviews, evaluate studies, determine levels of evidence (Table 1\n), and develop treatment recommendations (see Part 3: Evidence Evaluation Process).4 When possible, 2 expert reviewers were invited to perform independent evaluations for each topic. The worksheet authors submitted their search strategies to 1 of 3 worksheet review experts. The lead evidence evaluation expert also reviewed all worksheets and assisted the worksheet authors in ensuring consistency and quality in the evidence evaluation. This process is described in detail in Part 3.4 In conjunction with the International First Aid Science Advisory Board, the AHA established an additional task force to review evidence on first aid. This topic is summarised in Part 13. The evidence review followed the same process but was not part of the formal ILCOR review.",

Some of the worksheets were merged while in other cases there was no new evidence and the worksheets/topics were deleted. The 2010 International Consensus Conference in February, 2010 involved 313 experts from 30 countries. A final total of 277 specific resuscitation questions, each in standard PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, were considered by 356 worksheet authors who reviewed thousands of relevant, peer-reviewed publications. Many of these worksheets were presented and discussed at monthly or semimonthly task force international web conferences (i.e., \u201cwebinars\u201d that involved conference calls with simultaneous internet conferencing). Beginning in May 2009 the evidence review and summary portions of the evidence evaluation worksheets, with worksheet author conflict of interest (COI) statements, were posted on the ILCOR Web site (www.ilcor.org). Journal advertisements and emails invited public comment. Persons who submitted comments were required to indicate their potential conflicts of interest. Public comments and potential conflicts of interest were sent to the appropriate ILCOR task force chair and worksheet author for consideration.",

All of the participants were governed by the COI management principles regardless of their role in the CoSTR process. COI disclosure was required from all participants and was updated annually or when changes occurred. Commercial relationships were considered at every stage of the evidence evaluation process and, depending on the nature of the relationship and their role in the evidence evaluation process, participants were restricted from some activities (i.e., leading, voting, deciding, writing, discussing) that directly or indirectly related to that commercial interest. While the focus of the process was the evaluation of the scientific evidence, attention was given to potential COI throughout the CoSTR process.5, 6, 7 This policy is described in detail in Part 4: \u201cManagement of Potential Conflicts of Interest.\u201d8\n",

Educational techniques for teaching, assessing, and maintaining resuscitation knowledge and skills and personnel needed at cesarean sections were also debated. The following are the major new recommendations:\u2022Progression to the next step after the initial evaluation is now directed by the simultaneous assessment of 2 vital characteristics, heart rate and respirations. The use of a third assessment\u2014that of color is now replaced by oximetry assessment of oxyhaemoglobin saturation.\u2022For babies born at term, it is best to begin resuscitation with air rather than 100% oxygen.\u2022Administration of supplementary oxygen should be regulated by blending oxygen and air and the amount delivered to be guided by oximetry.\u2022The available evidence does not support or refute the routine tracheal suctioning of infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid, even when the infant is depressed.\u2022The compression\u2013ventilation ratio should remain at 3:1 for neonates unless arrest is known to be of cardiac aetiology, in which case a higher ratio should be considered.\u2022Infants born at term or near term with evolving moderate to severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy should be offered therapeutic hypothermia, which should be initiated and conducted under clearly-defined protocols with treatment in neonatal intensive care facilities and the capabilities for multidisciplinary care and follow-up.\u2022It is appropriate to consider discontinuance of resuscitation if there has been no detectable heart rate for 10 min.
