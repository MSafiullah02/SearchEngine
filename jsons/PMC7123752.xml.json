The concept of disaster and the extent of the attendant humanitarian obligations, for scholars like Gordijn and ten Have, is still under philosophical rumination.6 Hence, Hearn describes disaster bioethics as an emerging area of academic inquiry.7 Consequently, there is only a sparse amount of published literature focused on elaborating the ethical issues that disasters bring about. Some of the major works on this theme include Zack who emphasizes issues such as uncertainty as one of the core moral quandaries that arise in disaster situations.8 George Annas\u2019 worst-case scenarios perspective underscores how useful policies and practices may need to override individual interests.9 Scholars like da Costa recognize the importance of human rights in disaster contexts and argue that human rights can enhance individuals\u2019 resilience to face disasters.10 However, such an approach fails to deal with the morally thorny issue of balancing conflicting rights based on competing needs and interests, especially those due to the presence of overwhelming needs and insufficient human and material resources.11\n",

The unexpected nature of natural disasters often shapes the damage and human suffering that ensue as well as the disparity between human needs and resources available to immediately confront the utilitarian goal of doing the most good or benefit(s) for as many people as possible with a minimal level of harm.13 In disaster scenarios, the ethical goal generally entails finding some means to minimize the damaging social consequences. As such, actions that will lead positive social consequences are preferred14 and usually pursued.

Engaging these tasks demands some training and re-training of actors within and outside the healthcare sector.17 This is because on the one hand, professionals working in disaster situations face urgent choices which usually diverge from their normal and accustomed duty-related or deontological ethos.18 On the other hand, nonhealthcare-based actors will have varying desires to render help to victims of disasters, desires which they will hardly be able to adequately translate into positive \u201cclinical outcomes\u201d in the absence of prior and proper training. Although disasters are by nature sudden, they are not completely void of the influence of human agency, hence, human culpability. Scholars like Dranseika share this view and argue that humans causally contribute to the negative outcomes of even such paradigmatic natural disasters as earthquakes, typhoons, and volcano eruptions.19 This remark underscores the notion that some disasters may be either preventable or their overall impacts limited when relevant and carefully orchestrated human actions are taken before they occur or during ongoing disaster episodes. Whereas scholars like Bhan20 usually emphasize this preventive approach, there has been little articulation of specifics in relation to accomplishing such a task. A possible reason for the difficulty in articulating a preventing approach, at least on a broad scale, to public health disasters involves the complex interplay between pre-disaster factors, the causal linkages between human and non-human parameters, and the biologically nuanced roles that microbial organisms play in their onset.",

Perhaps, a striking approach is that of Kalokairinou who contends that a virtue ethics approach which creates a virtuous disposition in persons responding to disaster situations constitutes a richer and more efficient way of dealing with the associated moral dilemmas.38 Put another way, Kalokairinou seems to be saying that if all the potential relevant actors for particular kinds of disasters may be identified before a given disaster so that certain virtues are infused into them, then they will more likely than not act virtuously during disasters. If this interpretation is true, then responding ethically to disasters will entail a long-term moral endeavor that will need to involve every segment of the society. How such a task may be counted worthy of pursuit in an increasingly pluralistic, secularized, and post-modern world remains the major setback to this approach but it does not render it void of logical credence. Perhaps, partly because the scholarly discussion on disaster bioethics has only recently begun,39 some scholars believe that the best that can be attained in handling disasters is a non-ideal ethical approach.40\n",

Some of the seminal writings in this line of ethical reflection include Harris and Holm who emphasize the moral duty of not infecting others. For them, failure to act on this obligation translates into deliberately harming others. Yet, a system of compensation may be necessary to motivate people to comply.41 Kass argues that a public health ethics approach needs to reduce morbidity or mortality and minimize any existing social injustices while adopting fair procedures.42 Callahan and Jennings contend that ethics and public health cannot be advanced without taking into consideration the values of the general society as well as that of the particular communities where the public ethical course of action is needed.43 This echoes Rhodes age-long remark that the practice of medicine is inseparable from the values of the society in which its practice occurs.44 If contemporary public health is bereft of national boundaries and is inherently global,45 then engaging the ethical issues generated by public health inevitably needs an approach that is local and context specific, globally sensitive, and nuanced. The absence of a global health policy response further highlights the necessity of such an approach.46\n",

Effective public health is a participatory and often coordinated course of activities which require cooperation amongst the different professional and non-professional actors in terms of a clear delineation of who does what and to what end. This affirms the idea that public health involves cooperative behavior and relationships that are forged on overlapping values and elements of trust.62 As such. stakeholders including professionals, policymakers, and patients (or potential patients) as well as the social context ultimately influence public health goals.63 However, the destruction, death, disease/disorders, displacement, disappearance, and disarray that characterize disasters and which can affect all public health actors will inevitably disrupt the participatory activities during public health disasters.

Such instances cannot be ignored and deserve attention and critical reflection considering the interconnection between health or the right to health and human rights.84 In other words, denial of health needs during public health disaster situations\u2014for whatever potentially justifiable reasons\u2014constitutes a denial of rights. This clearly echoes the thrust of the moral tension that is at the heart of public health ethics.

For example, the 1976 Ebola Sudan outbreak had a mortality rate of 53%, the second outbreak in Zaire also in 1976 had a rate of 89% and the third outbreak in Sudan in 1979 had a mortality rate of 65%.96 These figures translate not only into the deaths of individual human beings including mothers, fathers, children, uncles, and aunties but also engender the social, personal and economic disruption of the lives of the dependents (children and spouses), parents, and associates of the victims. The morbidity wrought by the 2014 Ebola outbreak which killed more than half of infected persons further highlights the mortality of this public health issue and its disastrous consequences. It likewise underscores the importance of a proper pragmatic and ethical approach, especially in terms of the ease with which the disease transcended borders97 and rapidly acquired a global status. With the rise in rapid air-transportation capabilities today which readily moves people including the infected from one region to another (potentially exporting diseases), it is no surprise that there have been suggestions that quantitative analysis of worldwide air-traffic patterns may enable cities and countries around the world to better anticipate the risks of importing global infectious diseases.98 The air transportation restrictions that were instituted during the 2014 Ebola outbreak illustrates this public health preventive approach.",

Consider, for instance, Mr. G who is a business man living in an area where an outbreak of Ebola has recently taken place.

In the case of atypical drug-resistant tuberculosis, a completely new ethical lens is developed based on the specific parameters associated with its dynamics.
