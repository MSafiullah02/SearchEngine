            "text": "Lentiviruses have infected several mammalian species including humans (human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2), non-human primates (simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV's)) and cats (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)), sometimes affecting a significant proportion of the host population (for reviews see [1], [2]). Despite their relatively wide distribution, the transmission of lentiviruses is generally not very efficient. After inoculation, the virus enters host target cells via interaction with one or more cellular receptors. For HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, CD4 is used as the primary receptor while chemokine receptors like CCR-5 or alternatively CXCR-4 are required as secondary receptor. Similarly, FIV enters its target cell using CD134 as a primary and CXCR-4 as a co-receptor. Interference with viral entry by vaccine-induced antibodies or antiviral therapy has been one of the major goals in the development of lentiviral intervention strategies. In spite of huge investments, success in the field of lentivirus vaccine development has been limited and in some cases the use of experimental lentiviral vaccines proved to be counterproductive: it rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection. Here we review reported examples of vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to virus infection in general and lentivirus infection in particular, as well as currently known mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon.",

            "text": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection by increasing viral entry is a mechanism that has been observed for viruses of several families and has also been shown to play an important role in the natural pathogenesis of some of these (for review see [3]). Probably the best-known example of ADE of infection is the in vitro enhancement of Dengue virus (DENV, a member of the Flaviviridae family) entry by virus specific antibodies. The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, consists of arthropod-borne viruses such as Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and DENV. Four serotypes of DENV have been described, with multiple serotypes co-circulating in endemic areas. Infection with any of the DENV serotypes may result in a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, ranging from a mild influenza-like illness, known as dengue fever (DF), to the most severe forms of the disease characterized by coagulopathy and increased vascular permeability: dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). This may progress to hypovolemic shock in certain patients causing dengue shock syndrome (DSS). ADE was first described in in vitro systems for MVEV and WNV in 1964 [4]. ADE was subsequently postulated by Halstead and colleagues based on the observation that DHF and DSS were predominantly seen in children experiencing a second infection with a heterologous DENV serotype [5], [6]. They observed that the incidence of DHF and DSS peaked in two populations of young children [7]. One peak occurred in infants (aged 6\u20139 months) that were infected with a DENV serotype different from the serotype that had infected their mothers previously. The key observation was that severe disease occurred in infants whose maternal antibodies had declined to low, sub-neutralizing levels. The other peak was observed in young children who had experienced an earlier, usually mild or subclinical, infection and were later infected with a different DENV serotype. These observations led to the conclusion that pre-existing immunity against DENV could predispose individuals for a more serious infection with a heterologous serotype of DENV and did not afford protection against disease. Later, several epidemiological studies provided circumstantial evidence for the role of pre-existing humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of DHF [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In vitro experiments showed that DENV infection could be enhanced using polyclonal antisera raised against heterologous DENV serotypes [5], [6]. Furthermore, it was shown that administration of DENV-specific maternal antibodies enhanced the severity of DENV infection of Rhesus macaques\n[13]: monkeys infected in presence of anti-DENV antibody developed higher levels of viremia and for a longer period than the control monkeys.",

            "text": "Although many of the details regarding Fc receptor \u03b3 (Fc\u03b3R)-mediated entry of DENV are still unclear, Fc\u03b3RIa and Fc\u03b3RIIa were shown to play an important role [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Fc\u03b3RIIa was more efficient than Fc\u03b3RIa in enhancing DENV infection of Fc\u03b3R-transfected cells in vitro\n[17]. The role of Fc\u03b3RIII in ADE of DENV infection remains unknown, but is likely to be involved as well. The expected result of ADE for viral infection would be an increased viral load [19], [20], [21], most likely caused by infection of a higher number of susceptible cells. Alternatively, Fc\u03b3R-mediated entry may modulate the antiviral immune response [22]. Recent studies with Ross River virus and DENV showed that entry via the Fc\u03b3R pathway could suppress the expression of antiviral genes and enhance IL-10 production in mononuclear cells in vitro. In contrast, entry via the usual cellular receptor did not affect the induction of antiviral effector mechanisms [23], [24]. Although the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS has not been elucidated, the ADE of infection hypothesis remains a significant concern in the development of safe and effective vaccines.",

            "text": "Feline Corona Virus (FCoV) infection of cats is usually mild but can also lead to the development of a chronic immune-mediated disease with a high fatality rate, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP develops upon the occurrence of spontaneous mutations in certain regions of the FCoV genome that change the cell tropism of the virus, allowing it to replicate in macrophages. This is considered to be largely responsible for FCoV infection to develops from a relatively apathogenic into a chronic, immune-mediated disease. FIP disease manifests itself with a variety of clinical symptoms due to the infection of multiple organs, often including the central nervous system [25]. Early experiments had shown that transfer of plasma containing high-titred FCoV specific antibodies to na\u00efve kittens rendered these animals susceptible to more rapidly developing FIP than kittens receiving FCoV negative serum [26]. ADE of infection was subsequently shown to be mediated by antibodies directed against the viral spike (S) protein. Immunization with recombinant vaccinia virus preparations expressing the FCoV-S protein resulted in the induction of S-specific antibody responses and low-level neutralizing antibody titers and lead to an enhanced susceptibility to challenge infection in young cats [27]. During FIP, FCoV primarily targets cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage and ADE is thought to occur through binding of antibody-bound FCoV to the Fc receptor on the cell membrane [28], [29], [30], [31]. Collectively, these data show that ADE mediated by S-specific antibody and increased viral entry into monocytes/macrophages are at the basis of the enhanced susceptibility of pre-immune cats to develop FIP.",

It has long been speculated that an aberrant antibody response against the viral glycoproteins was at the basis of this phenomenon. Although indeed the neutralizing serum antibody responses induced by these vaccine candidates were relatively weak, short-lived and resulted in a rapid renewed susceptibility to infection after vaccination, other mechanisms than ADE could have been at the basis of the observed immunopathology [32], [33]. Besides anomalous antibody responses, there are several differences between the immunological response that is induced by either formaldehyde inactivated vaccines or natural infection that could explain the observed enhancement phenomenon: absence of specific cytotoxic T-cell responses, immune complex deposition in infected tissues, increased specific proliferative CD4+ T lymphocyte responses, and a bias of the specific immune response towards a Th2 phenotype [34], [35]. This was largely concluded on the basis of immunization and infection data generated in preclinical studies using mouse and macaque infection models for these viruses. Alternatively, the generation of carbonyl groups through the formaldehyde treatment of the vaccines could have contributed to the increased sensitivity to infection [36].",

The higher number of activated target cells, i.e. CD4+ T-cells and CD4+ cells of the myeloid lineage, most likely accounted for the viral bursts that had been observed. For example, bacterial products may activate CD4+ T-cells via toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and possibly also TLR-4, 5 and 7 [69]. Direct intracellular interaction of replication enhancing molecules from other viruses (e.g. herpesviruses) and HIV has been shown in in vitro studies [70]. Given the relatively low chance that two different viruses would replicate in the same cell in vivo, the contribution of this mechanism will not be of great importance to the overall virus production [71].",

HIV bound to DC-SIGN may follow different pathways leading to virus destruction (and MHC-restricted antigen presentation) or to infection. Infection of mature DC in cis results in low level virus production [85]. More interestingly, infection may also occur in trans, when the DC delivers the infectious particle to T-cells that interact with the DC [84], [86]. In this regard, mature DC has been shown to increase transmission of both R5 and X4 viruses to T-cells [87], [88], [89], [90]. The precise involvement of DC-SIGN in this process is still unclear [91]. Regardless of the molecules involved, HIV infection of T-cells is greatly enhanced when mature DC delivers the virus. DC may act as a vehicle that, like a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d, delivers the virus to an environment of activated T-cells. The immunological synapse that forms between DC and T-cells may further facilitate infection of those T-cells. In addition, virions are less susceptible to inactivation when associated with DC [85].",

In particular antibodies to the V3\u2013V6 regions of the envelope protein were associated with the observed enhancement of infection. In a follow-up study, recombinant envelope protein was prepared from which the part encompassing the region between V3 and V6 was deleted [98]. Vaccination with this engineered protein still predisposed for increased susceptibility to infection and it was concluded that also antibodies directed to epitopes outside the V3\u2013V6 region were able to cause enhancement of infection.",

Vaccination with DNA from which the FIV env gene was expressed induced no or weak Env-specific antibody responses and predisposed for enhancement of infection [101]. It was speculated that the immunization increased the target cell population for FIV infection, through a mechanism similar to that described after heterologous vaccination of HIV-1 infected subjects, as described above. The enhancement of FIV infection was associated with increased susceptibility of lymphocytes obtained after vaccination to ex vivo FIV infection and the induction of Env specific T-helper cell responses [102]. Collectively, these results suggest that after FIV vaccination in addition to ADE also other mechanisms may contribute to increased susceptibility to FIV infection. Schwartz suggested that the induction and expansion of HIV-1 specific CD4+ cells through vaccination might constitute a serious confounding factor in HIV vaccine development [103]. Indeed, it has since been shown that HIV-1 preferentially targets HIV-1 specific CD4+ cells in infected individuals [104].",

With CD4+ T-cells constituting the major target for FIV early in infection [107], [108], expansion of this subpopulation (through, e.g. vaccination) would provide the virus with an ideal opportunity for its replication [109]. Furthermore, the FIV co-receptor CXCR4 molecule is expressed on activated T-, B-cells and monocytes [110]. It was demonstrated that increased expression of CXCR4 in cell lines resulted in enhanced FIV replication in vitro\n[111]. Recently, using flow cytometric analysis of cell populations ex vivo, a clear positive association between CXCR4 expression and FIV infection was demonstrated, although results also suggested the existence of an CXCR4-independent mechanism of infection [112].",

Early studies showed that FIV can interact with C-type lectin receptors, like human DC-SIGN, and that this interaction facilitated FIV infection in trans\n[118], similar to the mechanism described for HIV-1 (see above). Furthermore, it was shown that feDC expressed the primary CD134 receptor and, to a lesser extent, the CXCR4 co-receptor. Although less efficient than lymphocytes, feDC support productive FIV replication [119]. feDC may contribute to the infection of (activated) CD4+ T-cells by immediate transfer involving exosomes, endolysosomal pathways or transfer of de novo generated FIV particles during productive infection of DC [114].

More recently a number of phase III trials have been conducted in seronegative volunteers at high risk for HIV infection, using monomeric gp120 preparations. The outcome of these trials was far from encouraging, with very limited induction of HIV neutralizing antibodies and no evidence for protection [124], [125]. However in these trials so far no indication for ADE or other forms of enhanced susceptibility were found.",

            "text": "More recently, a phase IIb efficacy trial was conducted in a similar high-risk population, with attenuated recombinant adenovirus-5 (Ad5) candidate vaccines expressing HIV gag, pol and nef genes. Also in this trial no protective efficacy was observed. In contrast, a significant trend towards an increased HIV-1 infection rate was observed in volunteers that had high pre-existing antibody titers against Ad5 (>200), compared to individuals with low pre-existing Ad5-specific titers (<200) [126]. Due to the setup of this trial and the complexity of the required statistical analyses, a thorough assessment of possible confounding factors is pending (http://www.hvtn.org/science/1107.html, presentation: \u201cSTEP Trial: Efficacy Analyses\u201d). Although the two categories of vaccinees were defined on the basis of their antibody titers against Ad5, it is unclear how Ad5 specific antibodies could enhance susceptibility to HIV infection. It has been proposed that the Ad5 antibodies would re-direct the vaccine to other cell types and that this could result in a different type of immunity [127]. How this would result in enhanced transmission of HIV in these vaccinees remains to be elucidated. Another hypothesis would be that the antibody levels in the persons naturally infected with Ad5 reflect the overall immunity against this virus. This would imply the presence of increased numbers of Ad5 specific memory CD4+ T-cells. These cells would be readily re-activated after vaccination with the recombinant Ad5-vaccine and thus create \u201can abundant pool of susceptible cells\u201d as targets for incoming HIV in the Ad5 seropositive persons.",

This would lead to the presence of activated memory T-cells, including CD4+ cells, which may contribute to increased susceptibility towards HIV infection. If any of these two last hypotheses would be valid this would prohibit the use of many viral and other vectors as carriers for lentiviral antigens in vaccines since many of the attenuated vectors that are being exploited to date are based on, or closely related to viruses that commonly circulate in the human population. Cross-reactive immune responses will be frequently present and the resulting activated immune system may lead to enhanced HIV replication rather than provide protection. This could also pose problems in Ad5 na\u00efve persons since infection with the wild type Ad5 virus upon vaccination with the Ad5 vector virus, will result in enhanced immunity to the Ad5 virus and an enlarged pool of activated CD4+ T-cells. This pool might increase the susceptibility for HIV if co-infections occur in areas where both HIV and Ad5 are endemic [128].",

Secondly, a mechanism involving immune activation, mainly via activated CD4 memory T-cells (not necessarily virus specific), is seen in some lentiviral systems. Activated DC may play an additional role in this mechanism in the case of HIV and possibly also FIV.

There may well be a delicate balance between these two outcomes and the final result of vaccination is most likely determined by the sum of these parameters. Other confounding factors that may be involved include type of candidate vaccine used, viral and/or host factors, co-infections and time after vaccination. Research specifically aimed at the identification of the mechanisms that lead to either protection or enhancement would greatly stimulate our ability to design safe and effective vaccines against lentivirus infections, and more specifically an HIV vaccine.",
