            "text": "Many RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes to generate specialized sites for RNA replication. How membranes are remodeled and what properties make them conducive for replication are unknown. Here we show how RNA viruses can manipulate multiple components of the cellular secretory pathway to generate organelles specialized for replication that are distinct in protein and lipid composition from the host cell. Specific viral proteins modulate effector recruitment by Arf1 GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, promoting preferential recruitment of phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIb (PI4KIIIb) to membranes over coat proteins, yielding uncoated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipid-enriched organelles. The PI4P-rich lipid microenvironment is essential for both enteroviral and flaviviral RNA replication; PI4KIIIb inhibition interferes with this process; and enteroviral RNA polymerases specifically bind PI4P. These findings reveal how RNA viruses can selectively exploit specific elements of the host to form specialized organelles where cellular phosphoinositide lipids are key to regulating viral RNA replication.",

During infection, the virus and host become engaged in a dynamic duet, lasting from several hours to potentially years (in persistent infections), in which the virus initiates spatio-temporally ordered sequences of subcellular events, along the way dramatically altering cellular architecture and physiology. The host cell not only provides building blocks such as nucleotides and amino acids for viral metabolism but also can provide a structural platform for replication and viral assembly (Uetz et al., 2006) . Many RNA viruses and even some DNA viruses such as the poxviruses rely on host intracellular membranes for replication (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Salonen et al., 2005) . In particular plusstrand RNA virus families, so called because upon infection their RNA can be directly translated into protein by host machinery, replicate and assemble on modified intracellular membranes (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Salonen et al., 2005) . The group of plus-strand RNA viruses includes many important human pathogens like picornaviruses (such as the enteroviral genus members poliovirus [PV] and Coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3], rhinovirus, and hepatitis A), coronaviruses (SARS), and flaviviruses (hepatitis C virus [HCV] , Yellow Fever virus, Dengue Fever virus, West Nile virus).",

Replication membranes for picornaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses appear to originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Schlegel et al., 1996) , whereas for togaviruses and nodaviruses the endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria are thought to be the membrane source (Magliano et al., 1998) . Some viral replication enzymes have sequences that integrate into the host membrane bilayer, such as NS4B, a polytopic membrane protein of HCV (Lundin et al., 2003) , and the 2B and 3A proteins of picornaviruses (Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990) . Many, however, are soluble proteins, whose mechanism of membrane association is unknown.",

            "text": "Plus-strand RNA viruses are critically dependent on intracellular membranes (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990; Salonen et al., 2005) , but the properties of the replication membranes that are required to support viral RNA replication have not been defined. It has been speculated that membranes may limit diffusion of viral/host proteins and viral RNA, thereby increasing the local concentration of reaction elements; or that membranes may provide specific lipids that participate in the replication reactions themselves (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . A number of cellular factors have been implicated in viral RNA replication; e.g., several high-throughput siRNA screens have identified potential cellular factors whose knockdown reduces flavivirus replication (including components of the endosomal machinery, actin modulators, and phospholipid-modifying enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol-4 kinases), although the mechanism by which any of these proteins might regulate replication is not known (Berger et al., 2009; Borawski et al., 2009; Tai et al., 2009; Trotard et al., 2009; Vaillancourt et al., 2009) . For PV and CVB3, both members of the enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family, we have shown that GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of the small Ras-family GTPase Arf1, was required for enteroviral RNA replication (Belov et al., 2007; Lanke et al., 2009) . GBF1 catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Arf1, stabilizing membrane association, which in turn recruits various effectors to these membranes (Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004; Niu et al., 2005) . In uninfected mammalian cells, GBF1 and Arf1 are both localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) , and the Golgi apparatus. Arf1's known major effectors at these sites include coat proteins such as COPI complex and clathrin, which regulate membrane budding, and phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIb (PI4-KIIIb), which catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-4phosphate (PI4P) lipids at the membrane bilayer (Godi et al., 1999; Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004) .",

We demonstrate how remodeling of the host secretory pathway by enteroviral replication proteins generates organelles with unique protein and lipid composition geared for replicating viral RNA. We show that a specific enteroviral protein modulates effector recruitment by GBF1 and Arf1, promoting PI4KIIIb recruitment to secretory organelle membranes. This leads to disassembly of conventional secretory organelles and assembly of ''replication organelles'' that are juxtaposed to ER exit sites. PI4KIIIb at these organelle membranes produces a PI4P lipid microenvironment, which facilitates membrane binding of enteroviral RNA polymerase and viral RNA synthesis. Finally, we find that flaviviruses, specifically HCV, also induce and depend on the PI4P lipid microenvironments for RNA replication. Thus PI4KIIIb is a key cellular protein exploited by several plus-strand RNA viruses for replication.",

At this stage, Arf1 GTPase, viral RNA, 3D pol ( Figure 1B , 4 hr p.i.), and other viral replication proteins ( Figure S1B ) were all redistributed to discrete cytoplasmic structures, which we term RNA replication organelles. These organelles persisted until the death of the cell, $10 hr after start of infection, during which time both viral RNA and viral protein levels continued to increase at these structures (Figure 1B, 8 hr p.i.) . Cellular GBF1, the GEF for Arf1, which we have previously shown to be required for enteroviral RNA replication, was colocalized with Arf1 ( Figure 1C , Movie S1) and viral RNA and replication enzymes throughout infection ( Figure 1D ). The replication organelles at 4 hr post-infection were formed adjacent to ER exit sites as determined by antibody labeling of sec31, a component of COPII coats, which are recruited by activated Sar1 GTPases to the ER ( Figure 1E ). ER exit site number and distribution were largely unaffected throughout infection (not shown). Furthermore, reduction in levels of GBF1 (>70% depletion) and Arf1 (>50% depletion) proteins with siRNA ( Figure 1F ; Figures S2A-S2C) or transient expression of a dominant-negative, GTPaseinactive Sar1 protein (Sar1 [T39N]) ( Figure 1F ), which is known to block the formation of ER exit sites (Kuge et al., 1994) , inhibited by $70% (for Arf1), $80% (for GBF1), and $50% (for Sar1T39N) the replication of enteroviral RNA molecules (Figures 1F and 1G) , whereas none of these treatments alone had any effect on cell viability (Table S1 ). Thus secretory pathway machinery GBF1, Arf1, and Sar1 proteins were all required for or facilitated viral RNA replication. Note that in all siRNA treatment or transient plasmid expression experiments, viral RNA replicons, where the capsid protein-encoding sequences have been replaced by Renilla luciferase, were transfected into cells and assayed for bioluminescence as an indicator of viral RNA replication, thereby avoiding complications in the interpretation of data due to potential impact of any treatment on viral entry or virus assembly steps.",

            "text": "Atypical Replication Organelles Formed at ER Exit Sites for Viral RNA Replication When we examined by high-resolution confocal imaging the replication membranes formed at 4 hr, we found that neither the coat proteins 3COPI (a component of the COPI coat complex) and clathrin nor the clathrin adaptor g-adaptin, which are all known Arf1 effectors required for sorting/budding of cargo, including Golgi enzyme Galactosyltransferase (GalT), were colocalized with Arf1 at these organelles (Figures 2A-2C ). Note that in uninfected cells Arf1 is colocalized at the Golgi/ TGN/ERGIC with each of these components (Figures S3A-S3G). We assessed the colocalization between Arf1 and these components, at the start (0 hr) and at 4 hr post-infection, by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients ( Figure S4 ). In infected cells COPI, clathrin, and g-adaptin were dispersed across the cytoplasm while their total cellular levels remained unchanged as determined by western blotting (not shown).

Error bars are SEM from eight replicates for each condition (**p < 0.01). See also Table S1. r.l.u% = relative light unit %. All fluorescence images were confocal images of optical slice thickness $1 mm. Scale bar, 10 mm. was surprising given that Arf1 is able to bind and hydrolyze GTP at these sites (Belov et al., 2007) and hence a priori capable of recruiting these effectors. Consistent with the absence of coats, these organelles were not labeled with Golgi enzymes ( Figure 2D ; Movie S2), which typically sort into GBF1/Arf1-GTP/COPI membranes at the ERGIC and Golgi apparatus of uninfected cells ( Figure S3C ) (Lanoix et al., 1999) . COPI-dependent membrane budding mediates anterograde transport from the ERGIC and hence is required for the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus (Lee et al., 2004) . The absence of Golgi enzyme GalT localization to these organelles suggested a disruption of anterograde transport, and indeed at 4 hr post-infection the Golgi apparatus was completely disassembled (Movie S2); consistent with this, trafficking of secretory cargo to the cell surface was blocked ( Figures S3H and S3I ). In addition, ER-GIC/Golgi matrix protein GM130 ( Figure 2E ) and endosomal components such as transferrin receptor ( Figure S3J ) were also absent from these membranes. Nevertheless, these organelles did contain a combination of other TGN, Golgi, and ERGIC components including TGN46, GGA1, Rab1b proteins as well as some ERGIC 53 (Figures 2F-2I; Figure S4 ). Recent studies have found that depletion of COPI proteins from cells can result in a loss of secretory pathway compartmentalization and the formation instead of membrane-bound structures that contain components of TGN, Golgi, and ERGIC proteins (Styers et al., 2008) . Similarly, our findings here suggest that decoupling GBF1/Arf1 activity from COPI recruitment to membranes also results in a complete reorganization of the secretory pathway away from distinct separate conventional organelles.",

Given the absence of COPI or clathrin effectors at GBF1/Arf1-labeled replication organelles, we tracked the fate of PI4KIIIb during enteroviral infection. Before infection, Arf1 and PI4KIIIb were colocalized at the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3A , 0 hr), but at 4 hr post-infection, in striking contrast to COPI and clathrin, PI4KIIIb remained colocalized with Arf1 ( Figure 3A , 4 hr). This was confirmed by calculation of its Pearson coefficient, which showed no change between these two time points ( Figure S4 ). This localization remained for the rest of the infection ( Figure 3A , 6hr) and was correlated with GBF1/Arf1 localization and activity, as Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, which inactivates GBF1/Arf1 (by stabilizing the GBF1/ Arf1-GDP complex) (Niu et al., 2005) , dispersed Arf1 along with PI4KIIIb ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, PI4KIIIb was not just spatiotemporally correlated with replication organelles but was in a physical association with the viral replication enzyme complex. Upon immunoprecipitation of PI4KIIIb from infected cells at 4 hr post-infection, the enteroviral 3A, 3AB, 3CD, and 3D pol proteins, which are all components of the replication complex, coprecipitated with it ( Figure 3C ). Importantly, TGN46, which was spatiotemporally localized with Arf1 (and hence PI4KIIIb) ( Figure 2F ), was not coprecipitated, indicating the specificity of the complex between PI4KIIIb and the viral replication proteins. In addition, immunoprecipitation with IgG alone did not precipitate PI4KIIIb or any of the viral proteins (not shown).",

Membrane-anchored 3A proteins from CVB3 and PV have been documented to activate Arf1 by binding GBF1 and are required for viral RNA replication (Belov et al., 2007; Wessels et al., 2006; Lanke et al., 2009) . At low levels of transient expression, 3A-myc was localized to the Golgi apparatus as determined by colocalization with Golgin97 ( Figure 4A ), along with native GBF1 and Arf1 proteins (Figures 4B and 4C) . Although GBF1/Arf1 was present at these structures, the levels of bCOP, a component of the COPI coat complex, were decreased at these sites 2-fold compared to cells not expressing 3A-myc ( Figure 4D , arrow; Figure 4G ) whereas the total cellular bCOP levels were unchanged (data not shown). Significantly, despite a decrease in bCOP levels at 3A-labeled membranes, we found that PI4KIIIb was redistributed with an $3-fold increase to these membranes relative to cells where 3A was absent ( Figure 4E , arrow; Figure 4G ). In comparison, recruitment to the Golgi of structurally homologous enzyme PI4KIIIa was unaffected by 3A-myc expression (Figures 4F and 4G) . In cells expressing high levels of 3A-myc, the Golgi apparatus was disassembled and 3A was localized to discrete membranes juxtaposed to ER exit sites that were labeled with PI4KIIIb but lacked bCOP and Golgi enzymes (Figures S5A-S5D)-a phenotype previously observed in CVB3-infected cells ( Figure 2A , Figure 3A ). Hence 3A expression alone enhanced the membrane recruitment of one Arf1 effector, PI4KIIIb, over another, COPI, and caused disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, thus mimicking specific aspects of the virally infected phenotype.",

RNA replication could be inhibited at concentrations as low as 125 nM and when PIK93 was added at time points after start of replication, indicating a requirement for PI4KIIIb activity throughout the replication process; and PIK93, up to 2 mM, had little effect on cell viability ( Figures S6A-S6C ). When we reduced PI4KIIIb levels with siRNA (Figures 5D-5F; Figure S2A ) or transiently expressed a kinase-dead PI4KIIIb (PI4KIIIb-KD) (T\u00f3 th et al., 2006) (Figures 5G-5I) , both PV and CVB3 viral RNA replication were considerably delayed (Figures 5F and 5I) and accumulated reduced viral RNA levels compared to nontargeting siRNA or GFP-expressing control cells. PI4 kinase activity and PI4P lipids have been implicated in ER exit site maintenance (Blumental-Perry et al., 2006) , but we found no change in distribution or number of ER exit sites in cells treated with PI4KIIIb siRNA whereas cells treated with PI4KIIIa siRNA had $50% reduction ( Figure S7 ). Hence downregulating PI4KIIIb activity-a kinase critical for PI4P lipid synthesis-inhibited enteroviral RNA replication.",

To distinguish among these we utilized a cell-free assay where viral RNA translation and processing can be uncoupled from viral RNA synthesis (Barton and Flanegan, 1993; Fogg et al., 2003) .

The inhibition was only $40% ( Figure 6B ) likely due to continued production of PI4P by endogenous PI4 kinase activity, or because not all cells that were transfected with enterovirus RNA were transiently expressing the Sac1 phosphatase. We next determined if the PI4P lipids were localized to replication membranes. We utilized GFP-tagged FAPP1-PH proteins, which are known to bind PI4P lipid-containing membranes in the presence of Arf1 (Godi et al., 2004; T\u00f3 th et al., 2006) . We coexpressed Arf1-RFP and FAPP1-PH-GFP and acquired time-lapse confocal images of individual cells during infection with CVB3 to monitor the distribution of both Arf1 and PI4P lipids ( Figure 6C ; Movie S3). At the start of infection the major PI4P pool in the cell was found at the Golgi/TGN compartment.

Using time-lapse imaging, we followed the fate of FAPP1-PH-GFP and Arf1-RFP within individual cells pre-and post-PIK93 treatment. We found that within $30 min of PIK93 addition, $60% of the FAPP1-PH-GFP associated with replication organelles was lost whereas the Arf1-RFP pattern was largely unaffected (Figures 6D and 6E) . This demonstrated that a significant fraction of the PI4P lipids at replication sites were a product of PI4KIIIb activity and that Arf1 binding to membranes was not dependent on PI4P lipids. Furthermore it indicated that the PI4P lipid microenvironment at these membranes was not static but turning over, as in the absence of PI4 kinase activity, the lipids were quickly lost from these sites. This could be due to conversion back to PI, potentially as a result of endogenous Sac1 phosphatase activity or transport out of replication membranes. The lack of complete FAPP1-PH-GFP dispersal upon PIK93 treatment also suggested that other PI4 kinase family members might be harnessed for PI4P lipid synthesis as well during infection at these sites. which the soluble 3D pol protein associates with membranes and catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA on these membranes is unknown. Given the in vivo localization of the viral replication complex proteins including 3D pol to membranes enriched in PI4P lipids ( Figures 1A and 1B, Figure 6C ), we tested whether the 3D pol protein had itself any affinity for PI4P lipids. We assayed for binding of 3D pol to PI4P lipids by incubating purified recombinant 3D pol with membrane strips spotted with different cellular lipids including PI4P. We found that 3D pol specifically and preferentially bound to PI4P lipids over all other phosphatidylinositides and phospholipids ( Figures 6F and 6G ). Thus 3D pol alone, independent of any of the other components of the viral replication complex, has a high and specific affinity for PI4P lipids that potentially can regulate both its binding to cellular membranes and its subsequent RNA synthesis activities.",

HCV, an enveloped virus that is a member of the flaviviruses, assembles its replication enzymes and replicates its RNA on remodeled ER membranes (W\u00f6 lk et al., 2008) . We coimmunostained the Huh7-derived liver cell line 3-5B(HCV), which contains autonomously replicating, subgenomic, dicistronic, selectable HCV RNAs from the infectious HCV-N1b strain as well as expressing HCV nonstructural proteins (Ikeda et al., 2002) , with antibodies against PI4P lipids and the HCV protein NS5A. NS5A, a membrane-associated protein that is part of the HCV replication complex of enzymes and is colocalized with HCV RNA molecules (W\u00f6 lk et al., 2008), allowed us to identify the cellular viral (E) Quantification of FAPP1PH-GFP to Arf1-RFP fluorescence from (D) expressed as a ratio. Error bars are SEM from ten cells for each condition. (F and G) PV RNA polymerase specifically and preferentially binds PI4P lipids. Purified recombinant 3D pol enzyme was incubated with membrane strips that were previously spotted with different lipids. Antibodies detected 3D pol binding. Two representative blots are shown. Binding was quantified and plotted in bar graph as a ratio over background non-lipid spotted membrane from three different experiments for each lipid type. RNA replication sites. First by quantification of PI4P-associated antibody fluorescence we found that 3-5B(HCV) cells, compared to parental Huh7, had an $45% increase in the total cellular levels of PI4P ( Figure 6H ). Second, whereas in the parental Huh7 cells the PI4P lipid pool was localized to the perinuclear Golgi apparatus/TGN region, in 3-5B(HCV) cells the abundant PI4P lipids were found colocalized with NS5A at discrete punctate sites all across the cytoplasm ( Figure 6I , inset). Notably PI4KIIIb reduction by siRNA knockdown (>90% by immunofluorescence staining, not shown) had greater effect on lowering PI4P levels within 3-5B(HCV) cells compared to PI4KIIIa reduction, though it is likely that both enzymes contribute to the increased cellular PI4P levels ( Figures 6J and 6K) . Finally, to test whether PI4P lipids were also required for HCV RNA replication, we measured the replication of HCV J6/JFH (p7-Rluc2A) replicons (Jones et al., 2007) in Huh7 cells where we had depleted the PI4P lipid pool by transiently expressing the Sac1 phosphatase either alone or in combination with catalytically inactive PI4KIIIb-KD. HCV RNA replication was inhibited by >50% when Sac1 was expressed alone, and the effect was greater ($70%) in the presence of PI4KIIIb-KD, as would be predicted ( Figure 6L, Sac+PI4KIIIbKD) . Thus the PI4P lipid microenvironment in the membrane is an important regulator of both enteroviral and flaviviral RNA replication.",

            "text": "Based on our findings we propose a model for the reorganization of the secretory pathway in enteroviral infections, which generates PI4P lipid-enriched replication organelles (Figure 7) . Here membrane-bound enteroviral 3A proteins bind and modulate host GBF1/Arf1 to enhance recruitment of PI4KIIIb to membranes, over COPI and other coat proteins, where it will catalyze the production of PI4P lipids, leading to the biogenesis of a PI4P lipid-enriched membrane microenvironment that is distinct from that in uninfected cells. This PI4P lipid-rich microenvironment will in turn promote the recruitment and stabilization on the membrane of the RdRp 3D pol from the cytosolic pool. 3D pol as part of a replication complex of 3A and several other viral proteins will then initiate RNA synthesis at these membranes ( Figure 7A ). Enteroviral RNA replication begins on existing PI4P lipid-containing organelles including the Golgi and TGN, which have the highest steady-state levels of this lipid in uninfected cells (Godi et al., 1999) (Figure 7B, uninfected) . Viral RNA replication is a positive feedback loop, where newly synthesized viral RNA molecules are translated into increasing amounts of viral replication proteins including 3A, which then further replicate viral RNA. Since 3A modulates GBF1/Arf1 effector recruitment, its impact on GBF1/Arf1/coat/PI4KIIIb interactions will become inescapable as its levels rise. The selective recruitment of PI4KIIIb to membranes over COPI will eventually disrupt secretory membrane trafficking and lead to Golgi disassembly by decreasing anterograde transport from the ERGIC and intra-Golgi trafficking, both COPI-dependent processes (Lee et al., 2004) (Figure 7B , 2 hr). Furthermore 3A-bound membranes emerging de novo from ER exit sites will develop into PI4P lipid-enriched uncoated membranes ( Figure 7B , 4 hr). In addition to forming replication organelles, disruption of secretory pathway integrity has been implicated in the suppression of cytokine secretion and MHC-dependent antigen presentation (Deitz et al., 2000) , thus serving multiple functions for efficient enterovirus replication and propagation.",

Modulation of host secretory machinery by viral proteins and its consequences are highly complex. The localization of some components can be explained through affinity for either PI4P lipids (e.g., GGA1) or GBF1 (e.g., GGA1, Rab1b) (Monetta et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) . However GGA1 can bind clathrin and g-adaptin (Bonifacino, 2004; Lefran\u00e7 ois and McCormick, 2007) and GBF1 can bind COPI (Deng et al., 2009 ), but neither COPI, clathrin, nor g-adaptin are present at replication sites. Potentially the high PI4P lipid microenvironment in conjunction with viral proteins may modulate interactions among GBF1, Arf1, and specific effectors, promoting the sorting/partitioning of some components while deterring others.",

However independent functions have recently emerged: several host proteins including CERT, OSBP, and FAPP1/2 specifically bind PI4P lipids (Lemmon, 2008) ; and PI4P lipids regulate selective autophagy and ER exit site biogenesis (Blumental-Perry et al., 2006; Yamashita et al., 2006) . PI4P lipids can locally change membrane curvature (Ishiyama et al., 2002; McMahon and Gallop, 2005) . PI4P lipid-enriched membranes during viral infection may generate highcurvature membrane pockets to shield viral components from host defense. Little is known about how soluble viral RNA polymerases are recruited to membranes. PI4P lipids may provide docking sites to concentrate viral proteins for efficient RNA synthesis. Enteroviral RdRp 3D pol preferentially binds PI4P lipids over all other cellular lipid components, and PI4P depletion specifically perturbs viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 5 and Figure 6 ). This raises the possibility that enteroviruses rewire host secretory machinery to generate PI4P lipid-enriched membranes to recruit to and concentrate on membrane RNA polymerases. Furthermore, PI4P lipid binding may also induce conformational changes and modulate RdRp enzymatic activity. The phosphoinositidebinding domain on 3D pol is unknown and studies to identify the lipid-binding site and investigate its occurrence across different RdRps are underway.",

(B) Uninfected (0 hr): Steady-state exchange of membranes, Golgi enzymes, and cargo through bidirectional trafficking between the ERGIC and Golgi/TGN compartments. Golgi enzymes and cargo are sorted out of Sar1/COPII-labeled ER exit sites into ERGIC compartments whereupon GBF1/Arf1 and COPI coats mediate the trafficking to and from the Golgi/TGN compartments. PI4KIIIb enzymes are recruited to Golgi/TGN membranes by Arf1 and catalyze the production of PI4P lipids at these membranes. 2 hr: Upon infection, newly synthesized viral replication enzymes such as the membrane-bound 3A target to and assemble on secretory organelle membranes but concentrate and initiate viral RNA synthesis on the Golgi/TGN membranes, where the pre-existing (i.e., prior to infection) steady-state pool of PI4P lipids facilitates viral replication protein assembly and RNA replication. Rising levels of 3A combined with its modulation of effector recruitment by GBF1/Arf1 will enhance the recruitment of PI4KIIIb over COPI, leading to a decreased rate of anterograde transport out of the ERGIC and subsequent disassembly of the Golgi/TGN organelles. 4 hr: Enhanced recruitment of PI4KIIIb over COPI results in the formation of uncoated PI4P lipid-enriched organelles adjacent to ER exit sites. The PI4P lipidenriched microenvironment of these organelles facilitates the ongoing assembly of newly synthesized viral replication proteins such as RdRp 3D pol and viral RNA replication.",

Furthermore small molecules targeting PI4 kinases, such as PIK93, may provide a basis for the design of new classes of therapeutics against viral RNA replication.",
