            "text": "Bronchiectasis, a heterogeneous disease, is characterized by a vicious cycle of airway infection and inflammation that results in structural damage to the airways and the surrounding lung parenchyma [1]. Many microorganisms have been associated with bronchiectasis, both as a complication of the anatomic abnormalities and possibly as a cause of the structural disease as well [2, 3]. Diverse polymicrobial communities are present in the airways of patients with bronchiectasis [4]. Studies using standard microbiologic culture techniques have demonstrated the presence of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens in the lungs of bronchiectasis patients both when the patient is clinically stable and when there is an exacerbation of disease [2, 5]. Newer molecular techniques have broadened our understanding of the microbiome in bronchiectasis patients [4, 6]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been repeatedly shown to be a problematic pathogen in patients with bronchiectasis and is associated with a worse prognosis [7, 8]. Multiple epidemiologic reports have shown that approximately 20\u201335% of patients worldwide with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa [2, 9, 10]. Several antibiotic trials have been published where the main target of therapy is Pseudomonas aeruginosa [11\u201317]. (See Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-61452-6_11 for a full review of P. aeruginosa infections associated with bronchiectasis.) Another problematic group of pathogens, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), is a common infecting organism in bronchiectasis, particularly in the United States and in parts of Asia [2, 18]. NTM infection is fully discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-61452-6_13. In this chapter, we will review the role of bacterial pathogens other than P. aeruginosa and the impact of fungal and viral infections in bronchiectasis patients. (See Table 13.1.)\n",

Age and overall severity of disease have been evaluated as possible markers for specific infections but are not sufficiently specific to pinpoint the infecting organism. In one series from Israel, younger patients (less than or equal to 64 years) with bronchiectasis were shown to be more likely infected with Haemophilus and older patients with Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae [20], but this has not been seen in other large patient cohorts. Although patients with more severe disease (based on severity scores) are more likely to have chronic Pseudomonas infection, other pathogens may be present and be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms. Radiographic patterns of disease are also not sufficiently specific for identifying the infecting organisms. Although \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d nodularity is frequently thought to be diagnostic of NTM infections, recent studies have shown that the \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d finding simply represents endobronchial inflammation not specific to a particular organism [21, 22]. Sputum color charts developed in an attempt to correlate degree of sputum purulence with specific organisms have not been reliable in predicting culture results [23, 24]. Hence, it is imperative that sputum cultures be performed in all bronchiectasis patients on a regular basis in order to target treatments and assess prognosis.",

            "text": "The most common bacterial organism reported in many epidemiologic series is Haemophilus influenzae. Thirty percent or more of patients with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with H. influenzae [9, 10, 19]. As with all bronchiectasis patients, the cornerstone of therapy for patients infected with this organism is airway clearance by various modalities, including mechanical, pharmacologic, and exercise [25\u201327]. When patients infected with H. influenzae have exacerbations, there are multiple oral antibiotics that can be used to treat the flares of infection. Institutional specific susceptibility patterns and patient tolerance should dictate the specifics of therapy. Maintenance inhaled antibiotics are generally not recommended for patients who are chronically infected with H. influenzae. One study of long-term inhaled gentamicin, which included a few patients with chronic H. influenzae infection, did show benefit and reasonably good tolerance [13], but studies that used maintenance aztreonam for inhalation had negative results [15]. Chronic macrolide therapy may be appropriate for frequent exacerbators as long as there is appropriate attention for potential adverse effects [28]. (See Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-61452-6_16 for a full review of macrolide therapy.)",

Expert opinion suggests that such therapy (by inhalation and targeted to the organism) may be useful in specific patients who have frequent exacerbations (greater than 2\u20133 per year that require systemic therapy) and/or in patients who have bothersome daily cough with a large volume of secretions.

As with Gram-negative infections, there may be a role for targeted antimicrobial suppressant therapy for patients with frequent exacerbations and/or significant and bothersome day-to-day symptoms. Chronic macrolide therapy may have a role, but worrisome resistance may develop, particularly when the infecting organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

To some extent, this may represent the limitation of routine culture techniques in identifying the infecting organism in some patients with bronchiectasis in addition to the difficulty some patients have with producing sufficient sputum for laboratory processing. One small study in 33 Greek patients with bronchiectasis sought to identify whether Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) might be present in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens; the findings were essentially negative [29]. New research into understanding the respiratory microbiome (see below) may help our understanding of what other organisms may be playing a role in the symptoms associated with bronchiectasis.",

A cohort of patient reported from Spain showed small numbers of patients had persistent culture positivity for Aspergillus (8.7%) and Candida (34.5%) [30]. It can be difficult to determine if these organisms are playing a role in the infectious symptoms or are simply bystander organisms in patients with other primary pathogens. Treatment aimed at Aspergillus should be considered if the patient has persistently positive cultures without another organism that might be culpable [31]. Candida rarely requires treatment as it is usually an oral contaminant. It is important to identify patients with the syndrome of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis that can cause bronchiectasis; this immunologic disorder is distinct from secondary infection due to aspergillus.",

In a cohort of 119 Chinese adults with bronchiectasis, respiratory viruses were found more frequently by molecular testing from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples when the patients had exacerbations of symptoms as compared to the stable state [5]. The most commonly identified viruses were Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, and Influenza A and B. RSV has also been found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of patients with exacerbations of their bronchiectasis symptoms [29]. Seasonal variability of exacerbations in bronchiectasis has also been postulated to be due to viral exposure. Patients with bronchiectasis exacerbations may benefit from screening for viral infection, particularly in influenza season. Yearly vaccination against influenza is also recommended for all patients with bronchiectasis.",

Our understanding of the wide spectrum of bacteria that infect these patients, including NTM, is growing. We know less about the impact of fungal and viral pathogens on the bronchiectatic lung. The impact of coinfection with multiple organisms is also poorly understood, especially with regard to which organism to target with specific antibiotic treatment. Current clinically available microbiologic techniques do not provide a full understanding of the microbiologic diversity within the lungs of bronchiectasis patients. We may learn more from ongoing research into the lung microbiome as well as the impact of antimicrobial therapies on the balance of organisms within that microbiome. At the present time, it is imperative for clinicians to carefully monitor the microbiologic results of patients with bronchiectasis in order to provide optimal and judicious antibiotic treatments as well as to help with assessing the prognosis of the individual patient. The frequency of monitoring for each type of pathogen (routine bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal) has not been clearly spelled out in existing guidelines. How sputum samples are handled (collection and processing) also varies from region to region and from laboratory to laboratory. In patients with established bronchiectasis, careful microbiologic surveillance in the stable and exacerbated states is needed. Clinicians need to be aware of local microbiologic data and need to track the results in individual patients. Close interaction with the local microbiology laboratory may also improve antibiotic stewardship for patients with bronchiectasis. Clinicians should strongly consider establishing a protocol for obtaining sputum cultures at regular intervals in their bronchiectasis patients based upon local infection patterns and overall experience with their patients. It is clear that routine bacterial and mycobacterial surveillance is needed; routine fungal cultures may or may not be of value and viral cultures are probably most worthwhile at times of exacerbation. More research is needed in this area to better standardize the role of microbiology cultures and microbiome results in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with bronchiectasis.",
