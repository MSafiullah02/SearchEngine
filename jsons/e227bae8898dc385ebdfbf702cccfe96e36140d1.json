Patients with cancer have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to infection, morbidity, and severe events. Given the high proportion of asymptomatic carriers and concerns regarding speed and availability of laboratory testing, novel detection strategies are necessary to supplement traditional screening methods and facilitate mitigation of viral transmission. Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19. Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes. This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions. We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.",

In particular, oncologic patients have been reported to be at increased risk of infection and at a greater risk of severe events (1) . As such, patients undergoing active cancer therapy are considered more vulnerable to significant morbidity from COVID-19 (3, 4) .",

A test-based strategy is also outlined requiring two consecutive negative test results (collected at least 24 hours apart), although implementation may be limited due to lack of test availability and capacity. Per non-testing strategy for symptomatic patients (Case 2), CDC requirements entail the passage of: (a) \u22657 days since first appearance of symptoms; and (b) \u22653 days since recovery (defined as resolution of fever and improvement of respiratory symptoms). However, these guidelines are admittedly specific to isolation. Thus, more stringent criteria and timeframes may be warranted for active cancer patients. As for asymptomatic patients (Case 1), our institution requires \u226514-days to pass from first positive COVID-19 result (typically without need for re-testing), although this 14-day timeline was cautiously re-applied towards the patient's second positive test date (ordered through her local provider).",
