The five critical days of Hajj witness simultaneous congregation of over 3.5 million Hajj pilgrims from 200 countries in a harsh hot desert climate either unsheltered or in tent accommodation, with limited human assistance. The ever-increasing numbers of pilgrims pose a challenge to global health security along with housing, food, water, transportation, communication, sanitation, crowd-control and security. Mass-gathering medicine at Hajj is challenged by issues of high morbidity, healthcare accessibility, patient management and evacuation especially in emergencies [1], [2], [3].",

(c) One mobile referral tent-clinic having 5\u20136 doctors, 5\u20136 paramedics per shift at Mina and Arafat during the five critical days of Hajj catered to 35 satellite tent-clinics. (d) Mobile medical task-forces having one doctor and two paramedics per shift covered mass-gathering congregations along the pilgrimage assemblage expected to have 5000\u2013100,000 Indians. Onward referral was to secondary-care or tertiary-care Saudi hospitals. (e) Two 40-bedded secondary-care referral hospitals having 8\u201310 doctors, 8\u201310 paramedics per shift catered to 13 static-clinics in Mecca, a 14-bedded facility catered to five static-clinics in Medina. Secondary-care referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab-medicine and radiology. (f) Tertiary-care transfers were coordinated with 30 Saudi-Arabian hospitals in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah.

Upper respiratory infections presented as throat pain, sinusitis or otitis after a viral prodrome resembling common-cold or influenza like illness. Lower respiratory infections presented with productive cough, dyspnoea and fever more so in pre-existing lung conditions such as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute gastroenteritis presented with vomiting and diarrhoea, with a history of food intake from multiple sources. Diabetic patients largely presented with pneumonia and cellulitis foot. There was inadequate glycemic control at presentation due to poor medication and precautionary compliance despite prescriptions of insulin and oral antihyperglycemics from India. Urinary tract infections (UTI) were found to have a predilection for female sex, diabetes and benign prostatic hypertrophy.",

The secondary-care and tertiary-care medical usage rates exemplify that most patients report with low acuity complaints which can be handled in primary-care, provided it is accessible to Hajj pilgrims. Similar age, sex, comorbidity and admission profile has been reported by other studies [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Overwhelming surge of patients is a triple edged challenge. One, it downgrades standards of care, compromises resource security and patient satisfaction. Two, it facilitates transmission and acquisition of communicable infections.

There are operational challenges at diagnosis, therapy and control of globalization of potentially multiresistant pathogens [2], [11], [12], [13]. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms has been found to be as high as 77.60% amongst Hajj pilgrims which can lead to epidemics and pandemics [14]. Increased post-Hajj prevalence of respiratory viruses from 7.40 to 45.40%, and bacteria from 15.40 to 31%, and consequent globalization has been proven [2], [14], [15]. Overcrowding during mass-gatherings increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and other coronaviruses, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), Streptococcus pneumoniae during \u201cHajj-cough\u201d. Ebola, MERS, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley Fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. Both pandemic and seasonal influenza are simultaneously transmitted during Hajj [16]. In turn, this also leads to increased antibacterial prescription, increased self-medication, empiricism and incompleted antimicrobial regimens, furthering the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. Prescription audit and promotion of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures are mandated, however it remains a resource intensive effort in the realm of mass-gathering medicine. Syndromic surveillance can form early warning outbreak detection system, however it may have limitations due to short duration of diseases, asymptomatic carriage of pathogens, oligosymptomatic presentation, under-reporting to healthcare facility by patients, and inter-observer variation in research cohorts [2], [14], [17].",

Physically demanding rituals attempted by elderly under analgesic abuse leads to gastrointestinal problems, drowsiness; worsens hypertension, renal and liver functions; and increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Outdoor pilgrimage rituals are associated with dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and sunburn. Multiple comorbidities seen in approximately 20% patients represent a big burden on tertiary-care Saudi hospitals and form the main risk factor for mortality during Hajj [8], [14], [16], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Diabetic patients are prone to heat illness, cellulitis and respiratory infections due to poor glycaemic control, relative immunocompromised state, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction [19]. Other studies have reported surgery, orthopaedics and trauma related issues during Hajj [3], [10], [14], [18], [19]. Various psychiatric disorders observed in the study have rarely been reported during Hajj [14], [18]. Extreme heat, overcrowding, physical exertion, dehydration, language barriers, tough living conditions and being in a foreign country for a long duration precipitates stress related problems [3].",
