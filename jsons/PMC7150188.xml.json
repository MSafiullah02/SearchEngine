However, patients are also prone to periodic deteriorations in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are important events that cause much of the morbidity, mortality, hospital admissions, and therefore healthcare costs associated with this disease. In the UK, around 10% of acute medical admissions to hospital may be attributed to exacerbations of COPD, the in-hospital mortality is 10%, and exacerbations account for 70% of the direct medical costs attributable to COPD.",

More recently, it has been suggested that a change in the colonizing strain may result in exacerbation, and further evidence that bacteria do indeed cause exacerbations may be drawn from the clinical benefit observed in trials of antibiotics during such events.

In studies examining endobronchial biopsies, exacerbations in mild COPD were associated with an infiltration of eosinophils, whilst in more severe disease the infiltrate was characterized by neutrophils.

Short-acting \u03b2\n2-adrenoceptor agonists such as salbutamol have a more rapid onset of action and are preferred to anticholinergics such as ipratropium. Combinations of \u03b2\n2-agonists and anticholinergics are often recommended in exacerbations not responding to \u03b2\n2-agonists alone.

Oxygen should be administered to correct this respiratory failure. The risk of hypercapnia in a proportion of patients with COPD necessitates that oxygen be administered in a controlled manner. There is little risk of hypercapnia if oxygen is titrated to achieve saturations between 90% and 92%. Achieving adequate oxygenation only at the expense of rising PaCO2 or decreasing pH suggests the need for noninasive ventilation (NIV). NIV is clearly superior to respiratory stimulant drugs such as doxapram in the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, with improvements in mortality, length of hospital stay, and the need for tracheal intubation. NIV is most commonly administered as pressure-cycled bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and is thought to be effective by off-loading fatigued respiratory muscles.",

Long-acting bronchodilators, both \u03b2\n2-agonists and anticholinergics, have also been associated with decreased exacerbation frequency, as has influenza vaccination. Initial trials of antibiotic prophylaxis were carried out many years ago, often in patients with simple chronic bronchitis, and current interest in this area, with more modern drugs, is high.
