A limited number of 2-1-1 services receive substantial state support, but most rely primarily on a combination of public and private support.12 The 2-1-1s have not addressed funding and implementation challenges in isolation. Several national not-for-profit organizations have promoted 2-1-1 nationally. Notably, United Way Worldwide and the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems (AIRS) have jointly championed 2-1-1 development. United Way Worldwide used its nationwide network of United Way member agencies to advocate at the national and local levels for adoption of and funding for 2-1-1s across the U.S. AIRS, the association of information and referral organizations, leveraged its network and incorporated 2-1-1 into its professional standards and certifications. These two national organizations, along with local 2-1-1s, worked with legislators to propose federal funding through the Calling for 2-1-1 Act. The Act would have provided substantial federal funds to support 2-1-1s throughout the U.S. Although the act was not passed, several 2-1-1s successfully received targeted congressional appropriations.13\n",

They claim that the valuations are transparent methods used to weigh relevant factors. Critics charge that it is impossible to monetize all inputs and outcomes of a proposed program and therefore cost analyses ignore important intangible outcomes.

            "text": "The results of the current study point to areas for future research and practice. The rapid diffusion of 2-1-1s suggests that the national network of 2-1-1s was an effective channel for sharing policy-relevant information. This raises further research questions: What contributed to the efficacy of this diffusion process? How might the network be used to spread future policy innovations? Does diffusion theory help us understand the mechanisms associated with early and late adoption of policies like 2-1-1? Why have certain groups not adopted 2-1-1? These questions may benefit from both qualitative and quantitative (e.g., mixed-methods) approaches.",

            "text": "Understanding the potential inequities in policy diffusion will be important. Diffusion theorists have posited that jurisdictions' internal characteristics (e.g., socioeconomics of the intended population) and propinquity to other innovators are related to likelihood to adopt, suggesting that isolated, economically disadvantaged areas may be less likely to adopt policy innovations, such as 2-1-1.61, 62 Data from United Way Worldwide indicate that rural communities may be disproportionately represented in areas without 2-1-1.63 Rural areas tend to have greater need for, but fewer, social services.64 This leads to the disquieting possibility that the areas whose residents could most benefit from 2-1-1 services may be the very ones lacking access. Future research should explore disparities in adoption and access to innovative social policies such as 2-1-1, as well as to understanding the mechanisms by which successful adoption is accomplished. As a result, research will benefit policymakers, policy implementers, and other practice-based professionals who are striving to accelerate the uptake of life-saving 2-1-1 services.",

There is promising evidence, for example, in the realm of disaster response and recovery, that 2-1-1s together form an effective national network that is able to meet unanticipated surges of need.12, 60, 65, 66 In their role in providing health-related information and referral, and in their emerging role as a proactive source for promoting community and individual health, the 2-1-1 network comprises an effective vehicle for diffusing new practices. Further, 2-1-1 and health practitioners may find fertile ground for furthering mutual goals by working together.",
