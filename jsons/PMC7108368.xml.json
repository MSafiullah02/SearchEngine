Cox regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for illness overall and for virus-specific infections. An indicator term was included in the Cox regression models to adjust for respiratory season and robust standard errors were used to account for multiple illnesses per child. Differences in the presence and duration of symptoms up to 10 days were evaluated using Generalized Estimating Equations with a robust estimator, accounting for multiple illnesses in individual children as described previously.12 The prevalence of each respiratory virus at enrollment of asymptomatic children was compared to the prevalence at each child's first RTI using McNemar's test. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In analyzing viral loads, the maximal viral load for each discrete illness episode was utilized.",

Lindquist et al investigated the impact of PIV4 as a cause of respiratory illness in children using culture.14 In their study, PIV4 accounted for only 3.5% of PIV isolates, compared to 22% in our study. A larger sample size is needed to further characterize disease manifestations associated with PIV4.",

With the use of PCR, RhV is increasingly identified as a more significant disease burden than previously believed in healthy young children.13, 15, 16, 17, 18 As in our study, Van der Zalm et al's prospective study of respiratory tract pathogens during the first year of life identified RhV to cause the greatest impact, though not the most severe individual illness.18 Our findings also add to growing evidence that RhV is an important contributor to severe respiratory disease in healthy young children. Several recent publications have suggested that RhV is a significant trigger of asthma and cause of hospitalization, comparable to RSV.19, 20, 21\n",

Similar rates were found in other PCR based studies.13, 19, 23 Evidence about the severity of co-infections compared to single viral infections is conflicting. In our cohort, co-infections were not more severe than single infections. Drews et al. concluded that dual viral RTIS had higher hospitalization rates than single infections.24 However, in their study, 58% of the patients with dual RTIs had chronic lung disease. Aberle et al. noted that in hospitalized children, RSV co-infections correlated with increased severity, but not non-RSV co-infections.23 The severity of co-infection may depend on the pathogens involved. We found that co-infections with CoV, for example, had lower viral loads of CoV than single infections with CoV, suggesting that the some co-infections might represent detection of shedding of CoV rather than a true co-infection. The most severe infection in our cohort was a co-infection, occurring in a child with a triple infection including RSV.",
