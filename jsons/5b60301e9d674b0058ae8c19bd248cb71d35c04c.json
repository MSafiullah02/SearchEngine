Most of these were models generated based on the concepts of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. In 2001, an International Sepsis Definition Conference updated these terms in order to facilitate standardized enrolment into clinical trials, but due to their simplicity and easy use physicians rapidly adopted them for daily clinical practice [1] .",

            "text": "However, few of these scoring systems are focused on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the leading cause of nosocomial infection in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation [2] . The approach to VAP severity has been traditionally based on three clinical items: The underlying disease, the time of onset, and the causative microorganism. The VAP-PIRO score ( Table 1 ) [3] , based on the PIRO system (predisposition, insult, response, organ dysfunction), has been recently developed by our group and endeavors to identify different risk levels for VAP. This score stratifies patients with VAP into mortality risk groups and correlates these with health-care resource use in VAP patients. The PIRO concept, a conceptual framework for understanding sepsis [1] , is a classification scheme that could stratify patients based on their predisposing conditions, the nature and extent of the insult, the nature and magnitude of the host response, and the degree of the concomitant organ dysfunction. Conceptually, PIRO was modeled on the TNM (tumor, nodes, metastases) classification [4] which has been successfully used to define prognostic indicators in clinical oncology. PIRO was introduced as a hypothesis-generating model for future research, but its practical applications were limited. The aim of this chapter is to describe a new approach to the prognosis of VAP based on the PIRO concept focusing in its main components and their relative impact on VAP severity and prognosis. Figure 1 shows the mortality rate in ICU patients with VAP classified according to the VAP-PIRO score.",

However, after adjustment for confounding factors, COPD was not independently associated with mortality in these patients. In contrast, Nseir et al.

Virulence and therapyrelated factors, such as inappropriate antibiotic prescription, have been consistently associated with increased mortality. There are several factors linked with MRSA isolation in VAP episodes: Administration of antibiotics before the development of VAP [28] and length of hospital stay, rather than the period of mechanical ventilation, were strongly associated with MRSA isolation [29] . Vidaur et al. [30] found that MRSA VAP treated with appropriate therapy resolved more slowly than VAP due to Haemophilus influenzae, MSSA, and P. aeruginosa treated with appropriate therapy. The risk of death in MRSA episodes is 20 times higher than in episodes caused by MSSA strains treated with beta-lactams [31] and a recent report showed that MRSA-VAP episodes were independently associated with prolonged hospitalization and higher costs than MSSA VAP episodes, even when therapy was appropriate [32] .",

While this will intuitively make sense to clinicians, data available on this issue are very limited. Several studies have suggested that improvement in oxygenation is the most reliable criteria to distinguish patients who are responding to antibiotic treatment from those who are not. Luna et al. [44] evaluated the performance of the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) in identifying which patients with VAP respond to therapy. These authors discovered that only the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio could distinguish survivors from non-survivors, as early as day 3 of therapy for VAP. Moreover they reported that the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio improved above 250 mmHg in survivors, and this improvement happened before improvement in the other components of the score (white blood cell count, fever, secretions, and radiographic abnormalities). Thus, the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio may represent a very accurate and rapid measure of the patient's response to therapy and can help tailor appropriate duration of therapy. However, Vidaur et al. [45] reported that improvement in oxygenation was unreliable in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and only fever was delayed compared with non-ARDS patients. At days 7 -8 of treatment, when antibiotics for VAP are commonly discontinued [46] , Chastre et al. reported that more than 35 % of ARDS patients with VAP remain febrile.",

As a consequence, a variety of hemodynamic combinations create a systemic imbalance between tissue oxygen supply and demand, leading to global tissue hypoxia and shock. Early correction of septic shock is crucial for patient outcomes, for which reason consensus guidelines now recommend early goaldirected therapy [57] for the first six hours of sepsis resuscitation.",

For example, low HLA-DR expression has been correlated with the development of nosocomial infections, and persistence of abnormally low levels of HLA-DR in the late phase of septic shock (day 5-7) has been linked to death [58] .

However, despite early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotics, mortality remains high in severe sepsis [60] . Recent studies suggest that macrolides may have beneficial effects for patients at risk of certain infections due to their immunomodulatory effects rather than their antimicrobial properties [61] . Based on favorable results in experimental models of sepsis caused by Gram-negative organisms, Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al. [62] conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 200 patients with VAP who were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or clarithromycin. They showed that despite no differences in 28-day mortality rates between the two groups, clarithromycin accelerated the resolution of VAP and weaning from mechanical ventilation in surviving patients and delayed death in those who died of sepsis. The explanation can be based on the regulation of leukocyte function and production of inflammatory mediators, control of mucus hypersecretion, resolution of inflammation, and modulation of host defense mechanisms or on bacterial quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa infections. Moreover, some evidence suggests that macrolides might facilitate the killing of micro-organisms in acute respiratory infections through the stimulation of neutrophil activation, whereas blood monocytes release lower amounts of TNF-\u03b1 without any change in tissue bacterial load [63] .",
