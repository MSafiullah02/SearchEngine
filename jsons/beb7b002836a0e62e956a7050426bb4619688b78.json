For comparison, we also plot Eq. (5) together with data of the initial epidemic phase. As one can see, the behavior is not purely exponential, as was the case for the early growth of cases discussed in the previous subsection. This is consequence of the policies of social isolation implemented by the Rio de Janeiro state governement. Indeed, the number of confirmed cases is still growing, but this growth is slower than the initial exponencial behavior. We observed a linear behavior when we plot the data in the log-log scale, as observed in the data from several provinces of China [29] , as well for some other countries [34] . Thus, to guide the eyes, we fitted a power-law function f (t) = c t d to the data. As one can see in Fig. 3 , the confirmed cases are growing sub-exponentially. We obtained from a least square fitting c = 0.0167 \u00b1 0.0031 and d = 3.28 \u00b1 0.05.",

In this case, we modified the model to consider isolation procedures in a simple way. The modified model describes well the data, and it allowed us to make a detailed analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies (see Fig. 3 ).",

For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [14] . That peak is associated with the isolation of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 500 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies, suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [14] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA.",

Right panel : Flattening the curve: comparison between the predicted number of Quarantined individuals for the model with (full line) and without (dashed line) the implementation of isolation policies. The peak of the curve is considerably reduced. In both figures the parameters are I 0 = 24, \u03b2 = 0.32, \u03b7 = \u03b1 = 0.018, k 0 = 0.033 and \u03b3 = 0.02. In Fig. 4 (left side) we plot the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state, as well as the temporal evolution of the quantity Q + R predicted by the model. There is a good agreement between data and model for the adjusted parameters I 0 = 24, \u03b2 = 0.32, \u03b7 = \u03b1 = 0.018, k 0 = 0.033 and \u03b3 = 0.02. For comparison with the model with no isolation policies, we also plot in Fig. 4 (right side) the evolution of the Quarantined (Q) individuals for the above-mentioned parameters, and the same quantity obtained in the subsection II.A. One can see the flattening of the curve: the maximum number of quarantined individuals decreases considerably, even for a small value of k 0 . Considering the result of Fig. 4 (right side), the peak of the Quarantined individuals is expected to occur in the Day 99, i.e., June 11. Some local governments in Brazil are discussing about the relaxation of isolation of people including the Rio de Janeiro state government. A question of practical interest arises: when is it really safe to relax the isolation policies? To address this issue, we considered the following slight modification of . 5. (Color online) Time evolution of the number of Quarantined (Q) individuals. The full line represents the main result of section II.B, i.e., the original model with isolation policies (k 0 = 0.033). The other curves represent the relaxation of such policies, starting from the days t \u2032 indicated in the graph. The inset shows a zoom of the smallest peaks. One can see that after June 1, 2020 there is no considerably change in the peak. the model presented in this section. In this case, the dynamics is implemented normally considering Eqs. (8) -(11) from the initial time t = 0 until a given time step t \u2032 . After t \u2032 , we take k 0 = 0 in order to simulate the relaxation of isolation policies, and the model is reduced to the SIQR model presented in section II.A. The equations are integrated numerically, and the results for distinct times t \u2032 are exhibited in Fig. 5. One can see that if the relaxation of isolation policies is started at t \u2032 = 61 (May 4, 2020), the result is disastrous: the peak of Quarantined individuals increases fast. However, one can also see in Fig. 5 that after June 1, 2020, there is no considerably change in the peak, suggesting a security date to relax the isolation policies. Even after May 20 the peak does not increase considerably, which lead us to conclude that if the end of isolation procedures occur between May 20 and June 1 the damage will not be considerable.",

(A.4) will not give accurate parameters, but they can be usefull. In such case, fitting Eq. (A.4) to the data of confirmed cases from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we obtained A = 0.26667 \u00b1 0.01218, B = 0.00297 \u00b1 0.00019 and C = 0.68921 \u00b1 0.12740. Based on such values, the estimated parameters are \u03b2 = 0.29539, \u03b1 + \u03b7 = 0.02871 (considering I 0 = 24, see the next paragraph) and k 0 = 0.02011. Eq. (A.4) can fit well the data, however if we consider the estimated parameters and perform a numerical integration of the model's equations (8) -(11), there is a good agreement only for short times. This explains why we fitted the data and analyzed the model in section II.B with other values of the parameters, namely \u03b2 = 0.32, \u03b7 = \u03b1 = 0.018, k 0 = 0.033 and \u03b3 = 0.02. Finally, the time in our graphics were counted after the first confirmed case in Rio de Janeiro state, i.e., Day 1 was March 5, 2020. The number of confirmed cases kept almost constant for some days, and start to grow faster since day 10 (March 14, 2020), where 24 cases were confirmed. In this case, we take the number of initial cases as I 0 = 24 for the model's purposes.
