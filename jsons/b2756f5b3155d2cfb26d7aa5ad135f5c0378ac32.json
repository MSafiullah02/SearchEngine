Culling of wildlife H R populations has been adopted, or is planned, to curtail transmission of several viral and bacterial zoonotic pathogens to humans or domesticated livestock, although the record of population control as an effective prevention strategy limiting spillover is mixed (Wobeser 2002 ; see the chapter by Palmer, this volume). Targeted reduction of specific H R populations for control of rabies virus variants has been employed in Europe and North America. On both continents, programs have targeted red foxes (Muller 1971; Debbie1991) and in North America raccoon and skunk populations have been targeted (Rosatte et al. 1986; Debbie1991) . Efforts are ongoing in Central and South America to reduce vampire bat populations in an effort to curtail the enormous economic loses sustained from vampire-bat transmitted rabies to cattle. Anticoagulants applied topically or systemically by direct inoculation into livestock are the major methods of vampire bat control (Crespo et al. 1979; Fornes et al. 1974; Thompson et al. 1972 ).
