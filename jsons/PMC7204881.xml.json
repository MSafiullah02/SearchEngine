            "text": "To approach the behavior of viruses acting as populations, we must first examine the diversity of the present-day biosphere, and the physical and biological context in which primitive viral forms might have arisen. Evolution pervades nature. Thanks to new theories and to the availability of powerful instruments and experimental procedures, which together constitute the very roots of scientific progress, we are aware that the physical and biological worlds are evolving constantly. Several classes of energy have gradually shaped matter and living entities, basically as the outcome of random events and Darwinian natural selection in its broadest sense. The identification of DNA as the genetic material, and the advent of genomics in the second half of the twentieth century unveiled an astonishing degree of diversity within the living world that derives mainly from combinations of four classes of nucleotides. Biodiversity, a term coined by O. Wilson in 1984, is a feature of all living beings, be multicellular differentiated organisms, single cell organisms, or subcellular genetic elements, among them the viruses. Next generation sequencing methods developed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, which allow thousands of sequences from the same biological sample (a microbial community, a tumor, or a viral population) to be determined, has further documented the presence of myriads of variants in a \u201csingle biological entity\u201d or in \u201ccommunities of biological entities.\u201d Differences extend to individuals that belong to the same biological group, be it Homo sapiens, Droshophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). No exceptions have been described.",

            "text": "During decades, in the first half of the twentieth century, population genetics had as one of its tenets that genetic variation due to mutation had for the most part been originated in a remote past. It was generally thought that the present-day diversity was essentially brought about by the reassortment of chromosomes during sexual reproduction. This view was weakened by the discovery of extensive genetic polymorphisms, first in Drosophila and humans, through indirect analyses of electrophoretic mobility of enzymes, detected by in situ activity assays to yield zymograms that were displayed as electromorphs. These early studies on allozymes were soon extended to other organisms. Assuming that no protein modifications had occurred specifically in some individuals, the results suggested the presence of several different (allelic) forms of a given gene among individuals of the same species, be humans, insects, or bacteria. In the absence of information on DNA nucleotide sequences, the first estimates of heterogeneity from the numbers of electromorphs were collated with the protein sequence information available. An excellent review of these developments (Selander, 1976) ended with the following premonitory sentence on the role of molecular biology in unveiling evolutionarily relevant information: \u201cConsidering the magnitude of this effect, we may not be overfanciful to think that future historians will see molecular biology more as the salvation for than, as it first seemed, the nemesis of evolutionary biology.\u201d",

The number of different viruses and their dissimilarity in shape and behavior is astounding. Current estimates indicate that the total number of virus particles in our biosphere reaches 1032, exceeding by one order of magnitude the total number of cells. Viruses are found in surface and deep sea and lake waters, below the Earth surface, in any type of soil, in deserts, and in most environments designated as extreme regarding ionic conditions and temperature (Breitbart et al., 2004, Villarreal, 2005, Lopez-Bueno et al., 2009; Box 1.1\n). The viruses that have been studied are probably a minimal and biased representation of those that exist, with at least hundred thousands mammalian viruses awaiting discovery, according to some surveys (Anthony et al., 2013). This is because high-throughput screening procedures have only recently become available, and also because prevention of disease has provided the main incentive to study viruses. Disease-associated viruses are those most described in the scientific literature.Box 1.1Some Numbers Concerning Viruses in the Earth Biosphere\n\u2022Total number of viral particles: ~ 1032. This is 10 times more than cells, and they are equivalent to 2 \u00d7 108\n tons of carbon.\u2022Virus particles in 1 cm3 of sea water: ~ 108.\u2022Virus particles in 1 m3 of air: ~ 2 \u00d7 106 to 40 \u00d7 106.\u2022Rate of viral infections in the oceans: ~ 1 \u00d7 1023/s.\u2022A string with the viruses on Earth would be about ~ 2 \u00d7 108 light years long (~ 1.9 \u00d7 1024\n m).

This chapter is an exception in that, despite trying to stick to solid evidence, there are some unavoidable excursions to speculations in an attempt to reconstruct ancient events. Although no research issues in biology are totally independent of others, there are some questions whose answers are directly linked to consider viruses as populations. Examples are the response of viruses to selective constraints (be natural or artificial), mechanisms of short- and long-term diversification, or the effect of viral load and genetic bottlenecks in disease progression. These are the types of topics addressed in coming chapters. They have as a common thread that Darwinian natural selection has an immediate imprint on them, observable in the time scale of days or even hours. The capacity for rapid evolution displayed by viruses represents an unprecedented and often underappreciated development in biology: the direct observation of Darwinian principles at play within short times.",

In this book evolution will be used in its broader sense to mean any change in the genetic composition of a virus over time, irrespective of the time frame involved and the transience of the change. It is remarkable that only a few decades ago virus evolution (or for that matter microbial evolution in general) was not regarded as a significant factor in viral pathogenesis. Evolution was largely overlooked in the planning of strategies for viral disease control. A lucid historical account of the different perceptions of virus evolution, including early evidence of phenotypic variation of viruses, with emphasis on the impact of the complexity of RNA virus populations, was written by J.J. Holland (2006). The present book was partly stimulated by the conviction that the concept of complexity, despite having been largely ignored by virologists, is pertinent to the understanding of viruses at the population level, with direct connections with viral disease.",

Both groups, in turn, are subdivided in several orders, families, subfamilies, genera, species, isolates, and multitudes of variants within each isolate. The task of classifying viruses meets with considerable hurdles, and requires periodic revisions by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). ICTV has been essential to provide conceptual order in the vast viral world. One of its objectives is the assignment of newly discovered viruses to the adequate group. A remarkable number of isolates, however, remain unclassified, an echo of the natural diversity of viruses, even among the limited subset that has been isolated and characterized.",

The nucleic acids written in the four schemes (two for groups 1 and 3 and three for groups 2 and 4) are those involved in the flow of genetic information. Mistakes in the form of misincorporation of nucleotides during the replication steps indicated by arrows are transmitted to progeny genomes. RNAs produced by transcription to serve solely as messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are essential for gene expression and virus multiplication, but misincorporations in such transcripts are not transmitted to progeny. It could be considered that some mRNA molecule may acquire a mutation relative to the corresponding RNA or DNA template and that this single molecule (e.g., a mRNA encoding a viral polymerase), when expressed, may induce further mutations; we will ignore this possibility since a single mRNA molecule should have a rather limited contribution to the overall genetic variation of a replicating virus population.",

However, RNA viruses that replicate entirely via RNA templates; (Group 1 in Figure 1.1), retroviruses; (Group 2); and the hepadnaviruses (Group 4) display a salient genetic plasticity, mainly in the way of a high rate of introduction of point mutations (Chapter 2). Their mutability may be an inheritance of a universal flexibility that probably characterized primitive RNA or RNA-like molecules, thought to have populated an ancestral RNA world at an early stage of life on Earth (Section 1.4.2). Thus, the presence of an RNA at any place in the replicative schemes (Group 1, 2, and 4 in Figure 1.1) implies error-prone replication and the potential of very rapid evolution. \u201cPotential\u201d must be underlined because high error rates do not necessarily result in rapid long-term evolution in nature (Chapter 7).

The available data suggest that DNA viruses are closer to RNA viruses than suspected only a few years ago, regarding their capacity of variation and adaptation. Evolutionary theory predicts that a high-fidelity polymerase machinery is necessary to maintain the stability of complex genomes (those that carry a large amount of genetic information). This necessity and the various repair activities available to replicative DNA polymerases must be reconciled with the observed diversification of DNA viruses (Chapter 3).",

Such consequences include alterations of traits as important as host range and pathogenicity, as discussed in following chapters. How such minor changes in viruses can have major biological consequences may relate to the historical role of viruses in an evolving biosphere. To further address this issue we need to examine how viruses may have originated. This, in turn, begs the question of the origin of life and the possible involvement of viruses in the process.",

Orgel and his colleagues documented that polynucleotides could be synthesized from activated nucleotides in the absence of any enzyme (as a review of these early developments, see Miller and Orgel, 1974). Recent work has established that there are multiple chemical pathways for abiotic nucleotide synthesis (reviewed in Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014). Mineral surfaces (clay minerals, zeolites, manganates, hydroxides, etc.) have been proposed as key participants in the origin of life, by providing scaffolds for the synthesis of nucleotide and amino acid polymers (Bernal, 1951, Gedulin and Arrhenius, 1994, Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014). The relevant features of clays are their adsorption power, ordered structure, capacity to concentrate organic compounds, and their ability to serve as polymerization templates. Adsorption onto mineral surfaces may lower the activation energy of intermolecular reactions. Minerals with excess positive charge on their surfaces might have played a role in the evolution of RNA-like or RNA-precursor molecules. It has been suggested that mineral-organic complexes (chimeras between materials once thought to belong to unmixable categories) could have been the first living organisms endowed with a genetic program (Cairns-Smith, 1965).",

On different clay types, nucleotides and amino acid polymers of dozens of residues have been synthesized, providing a realistic scenario for a transition toward primitive self-replicating entities (Ferris et al., 1996). One of the first types of Darwinian positive selection could operate prebiologically through differential surface binding.

The prebiotic synthesis of potential building blocks\u2014which might have been initiated earlier than 5000 million years ago\u2014renders plausible the existence of a pre-RNA era that was then replaced by an RNA world in the late Hadean early Archean periods on Earth. This stage should have been followed by one in which RNA was complemented by DNA as repository of genetic information (Bywater, 2012). Polymers other than DNA and RNA are also capable of encoding evolvable inheritable information (Pinheiro et al., 2012, Robertson and Joyce, 2012). Heterogeneous nucleic acid molecules (including mixtures of ribo- and desoxyribo-polymers) can give rise to functional nucleic acids (Gilbert, 1986, Lazcano, 1994a, Gesteland et al., 2006, Derr et al., 2011, Szostak, 2011, Trevino et al., 2011). RNA enzymes (ribozymes) such as RNA ligases can evolve from random-sequence RNAs (Joyce, 2004, Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014). The critical polymerization reaction involves the formation of a phosphodiester bond and release of pyrophosphate\u2014analogous to the reactions catalyzed by the present-day RdRps\u2014and represent an incipient, primitive anabolism (Eigen, 1992, Lazcano, 1994a, Orgel, 2002, Orgel, 2004, Dworkin et al., 2003, Joshi et al., 2011). In support of a possible link between catalytic RNA activities and solid mineral surfaces in the origin of life (as summarized in Section 1.4.1), the catalytic activity of the hammerhead ribozyme of the Avocado Sun Blotch viroid was maintained when bound to the clay mineral montmorillonite (Biondi et al., 2007).",

Chilarity (the existence of two mirror images or enantiomeres of a molecule) poses a challenge for the chemical origin of biological molecules (Caglioti et al., 2011, Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014, Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014). Present-day biological systems use only d-ribose (d from \u201cdextro\u201d or rotation of the plane of polarized light to the right) while chemical condensation reactions produce equal amounts of the d- and l- (levo) forms. Nonenzymatic template-dependent reactions can be inhibited by the incorrect enantiomer. This led to the proposal that analogs devoid of enantiomeric forms, such as glycerol derivatives, could have been the basis of the most primitive genetic systems (Schwartz and Orgel, 1985). Theoretical studies support the notion that initial achiral conditions can evolve toward chilarity, in what has been defined as an extension of punctuated equilibrium to prebiological evolution (Gleiser et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Probably, very little, if anything, remains in our present-day biosphere of a primitive RNA world, let alone traces of the prolonged process that went from chemistry to the first replicating organizations, so profound have been the changes experienced by the Earth and its surroundings over 4 billion years. Contemporary catalytic RNAs (found in the ribosome, as part of some protein complexes, and in some viroids), as well as nucleotide-like coenzymes have been considered as possible molecular remnants of a primitive RNA world (Lazcano, 1994a). Some authors consider the possibility that cells whose genetic material is made of RNA may still hide in some remote sites of our planet (Yarus, 2010). For a transition from a purely RNA (or RNA like) world to an extended scenario with participation of proteins, the presence of a transfer RNA (tRNA) quasispecies and the generation of a genetic code endowed with evolutionary potential must have been critical (Eigen, 1992). Initial theories of how the genetic code might have arisen were put forward by F. Crick, L. Orgel, and C. Woese in the middle of the twentieth century. Main proposals included a stereochemical fit between some amino acids and the corresponding bases (or codons to be), progressive evolution from a one nucleotide to a three nucleotides code, gradual incorporation of amino acids in the coding system, and the frozen accident model of codon universality (for a review of early concepts, see Crick, 1968). New insights on the code origin have come from integrating knowledge of the mechanisms of protein synthesis with likely events in the RNA world. Primitive tRNA quasispecies (around 4000 million years ago, late Hadean, early Archean, Figure 1.3) and tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes evolved to fit the genetic code which was later expanded in coevolution with the translation machinery (Szathmary, 1999, Rodin et al., 2011, Caetano-Anolles et al., 2013). Recent models retain several features of the early proposals. The age of the genetic code has been estimated in 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 thousand million years (Eigen, 2013). The present structure of the genetic code is remarkably redundant, and it minimizes the deleterious effects of mutations, suggesting that protein conservation offers a general selective advantage for most cellular entities. Code redundancy may also contribute to functional mRNA secondary structures and stability (Shabalina et al., 2006; see also Chapter 2).",

As in current evolutionary virology, perhaps the most challenging problem to understand early life is to identify the selective constraints that determined (or influenced) the course of events.

Two of them are found in viruses: reproduction and evolvability. What selective forces might have led to the integration of these features? Concerning reproduction, there must have been a critical transition from the absence of any inheritable instruction (despite the presence of primitive polymers) to the first molecules endowed with \u201cinheritable\u201d information, for example, a macromolecule capable of producing copies of itself. The transition from \u201cnoninformation\u201d to \u201cinformation\u201d is an essential question for the origin of life that implicates both theory of evolution and information. Current evidence suggests that the process that allowed such critical transformation was slow and inaccurate. Slow because the catalytic RNAs selected in the laboratory are about 10 million-fold slower than most protein enzymes (Jeffares et al., 1998, Yarus, 2010). Inaccurate because pre-enzymatic nucleotide polymerization would rarely display error rates below 10\u2212 1 to 10\u2212 2 mutations per nucleotide copied (Inoue and Orgel, 1983). Despite a likely hostile environment, no \u201cpredators\u201d (be molecular such as degrading enzymes or others) were present to impede a slow accumulation of variant replicating molecules. Random and unavoidable mistakes allowed polymers to wander in sequence space with reproductive impunity until areas that promoted increased self-organization, replication, and adaptation were encountered. The adaptive potential of mutant distributions is a key concept in the quasispecies theory of the origin of life (Eigen and Schuster, 1979), and a signature of present-day viruses (Chapter 3). Replicative innacuracy and heterogeneity appear as recurrent requirements for the major transitions and adaptedness of the forms generated throughout prebiological and biological evolution. Once a primitive molecular \u201cmemory\u201d (signature sequences with some replication ability) was implemented, in the words of M. Eigen: \u201c....information generates itself in feedback loops via replication and selection, the objective being \u2018to be or not to be\u2019\u201d (Eigen, 1994, Eigen, 2013).

Due to the absence of oxygen and of an ozone layer, the UV radiation that reached the Earth was 10- to 100-fold more intense than today, the difference being accentuated for the radiation in the 200-280 nm range. Studies of the conversion of UV radiation into DNA-damage equivalents suggest a 2-3 logarithm larger biologically relevant UV radiation during the time of the putative RNA world as compared with today\u2019s radiation (Canuto et al., 1982, Chang, 1994, Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002). In such an environment, radiation-related mutational input could have had drastic effects on replicating entities in ways that can be only roughly anticipated from the present-day chemistry. Even the simplest present-day RNA genetic systems, with their small target size, would undergo severe radiation damage.

The fact that we have first discussed the origins of inheritable information should not be taken as its being independent from the incorporation of molecules capable of supplying energy for key reactions. The primitive cellular-like organizations might have obtained energy either from organic molecules captured from the external environment (heterotrophy) or from metabolites they synthesized endogenously using external energy (autotrophy). One line of thought considers that it is more likely that the first cells were heterotrophs, and that only later they evolved toward autotrophy, in the form of photosynthesis, which represented a major transition in the repertoire of biosynthetic pathways. According to this model, fermentation reactions were likely the first ones exploited to break energy-rich bonds, as a source of energy for primordial biochemical reactions.",

One of these proposals is that formation of pyrite from hydrogen sulfide was used by primitive cells as an energy source, resulting from reactions such as FeS + H2S \u2192 FeS2\n + 2H++ 2e\u2212 (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1994). Positive charges on pyrite crystals could accumulate negatively charged molecules (e.g., the products of CO2 fixation) and undergo reductive reactions. The system might have selected surface-bound polymers rather than monomers, and given rise to biochilarity (selection of one enantiomeric form over another) because of the chiral structure of pyrite (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1988). Then, an evolution toward an Archean carbon-fixation cycle would occur, a precursor of the metabolic cycles found in present-day archeal and bacterial organisms (Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014). The picture may have been more complex, as judged by the success of mixotrophic organisms which are capable of switching from phototrophy (light-mediated break down of CO2 for their metabolism) to heterotrophy in some extreme environments of the present-day Earth (Laybourn-Parry and Pearce, 2007).",

Here a second decisive positive selection event might have entered the scene at the stage of formation of protocells and the first individual cells (3600-3200 million years ago, Figure 1.3; Eigen, 1992). Lipid bilayers endowed with a splitting capacity should have been strongly selected at this stage of life development because of their power to spread. This underlines the concept that Darwinian selection need not be associated exclusively with template-copying processes (Chapter 10). Membrane traffic and reorganizations are essential for the life cycle of many present-day viruses (Huotari and Helenius, 2011). Virus particle stability and capacity to spread, associated with membrane capture and interactions, might derive from the early genomes that exploited membrane-based organelles to achieve functional diversification. Compartmentalization was the key to initiate a cell-based life (Morowitz, 1992).",

The various facets that distinguish living from inanimate matter are recapitulated in the definitions of life that scientists from different backgrounds have proposed, and some of them are listed in Box 1.2\n. A. Lazcano summarized the current situation in the arduous search on the origin of life: \u201cThere are still unsolved problems but they are not completely shrouded in mystery, and this is no minor scientific achievement. Why should we feel disappointed by our inability to even foresee the possible answers to these luring questions? As the Greek poet Konstantinos Kevafis once wrote, Odysseus should be grateful not because he was able to return home, but on what he learned on his way back to Ithaka. It is the journey that matters\u201d (Lazcano, 1994b; for a general overview of the history of life on Earth, centered in paleontology, see Cowen, 2005).Box 1.2Some Definitions of Life and Living Organisms\n\u2022Life is the property of a system that continuously draws negative entropy (maintains orderliness), and delays decay into thermodynamic equilibrium (Schr\u00f6dinger, 1944).\u2022Life is an expected, collectively self-organized property of catalytic polymers (Kauffman, 1993).\u2022Life is a property of any population of entities possessing those properties that are needed if the population is to evolve by natural selection (Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry, 1999).\u2022Life is what is common to all living beings. This answer is not a tautology, as it allows many attributes to be excluded from the definition of life (de Duve, 2002).\u2022Life is descent with modification. Replication is life\u2019s ultimate chemical and physical survival strategy (Yarus, 2010).\u2022Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution (NASA Astrobiology Institute).\u2022Living organisms are metabolic-replicating systems composed of molecules and cells which are subject to spontaneous changes in structure and function due to mutations (Demetrius, 2013).\u2022Life in three statements: (1) Life is not represented by any fundamental physical structure. (2) Life is an overall organization that is governed by functional rather than by structural principles. (3) In order for life to come about, there must exist some physical principle that controls complexity (Eigen, 2013).\u2022Life, whatever else it may be, is certainly a regularity among material processes (Eigen, 2013).\n",

Influenced by the discovery of bacteriophages by F. d\u2019Herelle, J.B.S. Haldane proposed viruses as intermediates between the prebiotic soup and primitive cells (reviewed in Lazcano, 2010). In those times knowledge of viruses was still superficial from todays\u2019 perspective, and lent to daring proposals coherent with viruses being perceived as simple. Despite simplicity and replication being features that could be also attributed to primitive life forms, we have to distinguish the role that virus-like entities might have played in the establishment of early life from the possibility that present-day viruses reflect how early life might have been. A reader versed in the structural and functional complexity of RNA viruses, with all the intricacies of virus-host relationships, will realize how unlikely is that present-day RNA viruses are remnants of an ancestral RNA world, at least as current evidence portrays it. Also, the conditions prevailing in the RNA world did not necessitate that a primitive replicon displays rapid replication\u2014a trait of most present-day viruses\u2014for it to become established, because of the scarcity of predators.",

HDV is dependent on HBV for the completion of its infectious cycle (reviewed in Quer et al., 2008, Taylor and Pelchat, 2010). The HDV genome is a mosaic RNA consisting of a viroid-like RNA and an RNA region whose complementary RNA (antigenomic strand) encodes two forms of a structural protein termed the delta antigen. Both the genomic and antigenomic RNAs possess a strong secondary structure with about 70% paired nucleotides. The delta antigen is encapsidated by the HBV surface antigen as a component of HDV particles. Thus, HDV appears to be the result of an RNA conjunction between a viroid-like RNA and an mRNA-coding region. Such conjoined RNAs might have been the precursors of the modern eukaryotic organization into coding sequences (exons) and intervening sequences (introns) (Sharp, 1985, Robertson, 1992, Robertson, 1996, Chao, 2007, Taylor and Pelchat, 2010).",

Prokaryotic cells can spread effectively among differentiated eukaryotic hosts, and tumor cells have been regarded as transmissible parasites (Banfield et al., 1965, Murgia et al., 2006, Pearse and Swift, 2006). The observation that some \u201cinfectious cells\u201d can be disseminated by insects provides a model for an early origin of vector-borne viruses. For a number of viruses, notably HIV-1, it has been recognized that transmission of virus from an infected cell into a recipient cell need not involve a prolonged stay of the virus in the extracellular environment. Infection \u201csynapses\u201d allow intimate cell-to-cell contacts through which virus transmission takes place. It is estimated that synapse-mediated transmission may be 100-fold more efficient than transmission of viral particles released into the extracellular environment. Obviously, acquisition of a capacity for long-range transmission in space and time should have provided a selective advantage to a virus. Perhaps the participation of infection synapses in virus transmission is an evolutionary remnant of an early period in which the infectious entities were cells, with now the \u201ccell-to-environment-to-cell\u201d mode of transmission coexisting with the \u201ccell-to-cell\u201d mode.",

From the catalogs of regulatory sequences and protein-coding genes from cellular organisms and viruses whose functions have been identified, some viral genes, notably those encoding the viral capsid and the genome packaging machinery, appear to be devoid of a cellular counterpart. Such typical viral genes constitute what has been referred to as the \u201cconserved innate viral self\u201d (Krupovic and Bamford, 2007), that embraces essential functions for the phenotypic traits shared by all viruses. Other viral functions do not deviate in any salient way from cellular functions. They include viral proteins involved in genome replication, and in proteolytic processing of proteins and polyprotein precursors. Comparative genomics suggests that the exchange of functional and structural modules through lateral gene transfers, together with fine adjustments mediated by mutation, have contributed to the coadaptation of cells and autonomous replicons over ancient evolutionary periods (Gorbalenya, 1995, Holland and Domingo, 1998, Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008, Villarreal, 2008). Even mechanisms that prompt viral variation in cell tropism (Chapter 4) have parallels in differentiated organism. As an example, a two amino acids insertion into ectodysplasin\u2014a member of the tumor necrosis-binding family\u2014alters its receptor specificity, and the differential expression of the two protein versions plays a role in epidermal morphogenesis (Yan et al., 2000). Furthermore, as the number of three-dimensional structures for viral a cellular enzymes has increased to reach thousands, structural similarities between key cellular and viral enzymes (polymerases, proteases) have become apparent. Arguments in favor of either ancestral cells or ancestral viruses being the main source of what we now identify as functional modules may never be settled.",

Regulatory strategies were also likely shared by cells and viruses. Small micro-RNAs that now populate the cellular world can act as molecular switches for RNA viral genomes to modulate their replication and gene expression (van Rij and Andino, 2008, Diaz-Toledano et al., 2009).

            "text": "Depending on their composition, lipid vesicles could form and remain stable at temperatures of about 100 \u00b0C. Their transfer to lower temperatures might have modulated their permeability prior to the stage at which peptide or protein transporters were inserted as membrane components. Here again, \u201cheterogeneities\u201d became important: membranes made of mixtures of amphiphiles display increased thermostability, permeability, and tolerance to divalent cations. Budding vesicles endowed with traits such as growth, division, and permeability should have been positively selected for their ability to spread favorable replicating molecules and protocellular functions. Selected protoviral vesicles became gradually dispensable for the spreading of beneficial genes, and viruses evolved from being solely beneficial entities into displaying also a parasitic behavior that exploited cell resources (compare with Sections 1.7 and 1.8). According to this model, when cells became independent units surrounded by a lipid membrane, viruses promoted selection of cells that expressed peptidoglycan molecules on their surface to decrease or prevent virus infection. This transition could mark the onset of an arms race behavior that has been associated with a survival strategy of many present-day viruses. One of the early outcomes might have been the formation of a cell wall, that allowed vertical transmission of genetic information, and rendered the cell metabolically independent. In addition, it provided an osmotic environment suitable for energy production. Genetic information and molecular devices for energy capture, storage, and use were equally important for a sustainable cellular organization. Thus, according to this theory, viruses originated from protoviral elements whose main function was to spread useful genes horizontally. The evolved viruses acted as selective agents to promote microbial evolution and then became established in an increasingly differentiated cellular world (Villarreal, 2005, Villarreal, 2008, Hendrix, 2008, Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008).",

Temperate bacteriophages (the prototypic example being E. coli phage \u03bb) integrate their genomic DNA in the DNA of their host bacteria. The uptake of cellular genes by viruses has been amply documented in transducing bacteriophages (those that can transfer DNA from one bacterium to another), as well as in RNA and DNA tumor viruses. Even RNA viruses that are not known to include a reverse transcription step in their replication cycle can incorporate host RNA sequences. Replication-competent, cytopathic variants of bovine viral diarrhea virus (a type species of the genus Pestivirus of the important family of pathogens Flaviviridae) can acquire cellular mRNA sequences in their genome, via nonhomologous recombination (Meyers et al., 1989). Insertion of 28S ribosomal RNA sequences into the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus increased its pathogenicity (Khatchikian et al., 1989). Some defective-interfering particles of Sindbis virus included cellular tRNA sequences at their 5\u2032-ends (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983). Sequences related to some flaviviruses can persist in an integrated form into the DNA of the insect vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Crochu et al., 2004). Endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) have been identified in the genomes of birds and land vertebrates (amniotes), crocodilians, snakes, and turtles. The evidence is that eHBVs are more than 207 million years old, and that ancient HBV-like viruses infected animals during the Mesozoic Era (Suh et al., 2014; Figure 1.4). The existence of alternative mechanisms for the integration of viral genetic material into cellular DNA suggests an ancient origin and a selective advantage of exchanges of genetic information in shaping a diverse and adaptable cellular world (Eigen, 1992, Eigen, 2013, Gibbs et al., 1995, Villarreal, 2005, Villarreal, 2008).",

An arms race implied by the virus-host interactions described in previous sections might have been the modus vivendi for viruses, only interrupted by occasional armistices. Alternatively, symbiotic and mutualistic interactions might have been the norm, only interrupted by occasional defections by killer personalities that have become the key actors of hospital wards and virology textbooks (Roossinck, 2011). It is fashionable to favor the second model, but one can find arguments in favor of either scenario. As discussed in connection with natural counterparts of the transition toward error catastrophe in viruses (Chapter 9), cells have evolved to be able to divert some physiological activities to become part of an innate immune response against viruses. This phenotypic flexibility of cellular functions to the point of being used to confront viruses attests of transient losses of an equilibrated coexistence. Some middle- and long-term equilibrium between virus and host population numbers must be continuously restored by selective events, otherwise this book would not have been written.",

Superinfection exclusion is one of the mechanisms used by present-day cells to limit replication of a virus when another one is actively replicating (or incorporated) into the same cell. Exclusion has a biochemical interpretation in the competition of two viral entities for cellular resources, but it might have been boosted by early cellular adaptation to limit viral invasions (Chapter 4). Likewise, components of the intrinsic and innate immune response that prevent infection and disease might have been also endowed with activities that promoted cell variation for adaptability. Cellular editing activities such as those displayed by some of the adenosine deaminase acting on double stranded RNA and APOBEC proteins are also part of the innate immune response against some viruses. Not surprisingly, in turn, viruses have evolved multiple functions to counteract the host immune response (Chapter 4).",

            "text": "The two opposite views of the activity of viruses in the biosphere (i.e., opportunistic occupation of any suitable cellular niche or intimate cooperative coevolution with host cells) would be expected to produce a different proportion of pathogenic viruses. Opportunistic invasions should lead mainly to disease-prone viruses, while long coevolutionary periods should lead to a dominance of nonpathogenic viruses. Not all viruses that have been characterized are pathogenic and, in fact, only a minority of those that exist might be. However, since only a few of the viral genomes that metagenomic surveys have detected have been characterized, it is not possible to adventure a proportion of beneficial or neutral versus harmful viruses. In the course of investigations on poliomyelitis, a search for related viruses was undertaken, and a number of new viruses later to be known as echoviruses were discovered. They were isolated because they caused cytopathology to cells in culture. The virus-containing samples were from individuals that did not show symptoms of a viral infection. The new isolates were designated as \u201corphans,\u201d meaning viruses without disease. The term echovirus derives from enteric cytopathogenic human orphan virus. Some of them, or their close relatives, were later associated with disease syndromes, but others not. Viruses as diverse as circoviruses, polyoma, or herpesviruses colonize a considerable proportion of animals, and only some of the virus types are the direct cause of disease (e.g., postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) by porcine circovirus type 2, or cancer by some polyomaviruses, among many other examples). Disease potential is unrelated to viral genome size. PMWS is associated with the smallest mammalian DNA virus genome of only 1.7 Kb, while the almost 100-fold larger herpes virus genomes can coexist with immunocompetent humans without noticeable disease. The fact that a virus is pathogenic or not depends on intricacies of virus-host interactions that are poorly understood.",

            "text": "The more the knowledge of the virus-host interactions progresses, the fuzzier the border between virus being pathogenic or nonpathogenic appears to be. Viruses may not damage essential cell functions, but may affect dispensable cellular functions. Studies by M.B.A. Oldstone and his colleagues on persistent infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that the resident virus altered a differentiated cell trait while preserving vital functions (Oldstone et al., 1977). This is one of many examples of virus-induced modifications of the so-called \u201cluxury\u201d functions of cells (Oldstone, 1984). Later work unveiled the changes in gene expression that underlie some of these alterations. Again, there is no clear cut distinction between a virus being or not pathogenic. Disease manifestations depend on multiple host and viral factors, including coinfections with viruses or other agents. With the increase of infections by HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) experienced during the end of the twentieth century, dual infections with these two viruses are now frequent. The evolution of HCV-associated liver disease (i.e., an increasing degree of liver fibrosis) is accelerated in individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Given the number of viruses still to be discovered (Section 1.3), and the spectrum of mild to severe pathologies that can be associated with \u201cdifferent\u201d variants of the \u201csame\u201d virus (Holland et al., 1992), we cannot anticipate whether most or only a minority (as often assumed) of the viruses that currently replicate in our biosphere are pathogenic or potentially so (Li and Delwart, 2011).",

We are left with trying to reconstruct. This chapter is excitingly as close to physics and chemistry as is to biology. Many of the questions addressed are open to debate and they will probably remain open for a long time. Here are some of them. Concerning the origin of life: peptides or nucleic acids first; replication or metabolism first; sufficient time or not for life to originate on Earth; formation of protocells as an early or late event; low temperature or high temperature; and so on. Concerning the origin of viruses: early replicons or latecomers in a cellular world; first RNA viruses or DNA viruses; first cellular microbes or viruses; viruses or cells as the elements that supplied building blocks for more complex genomes; and so on.

Complex populations, be them of viruses, cells, protocells, lipid vesicles, primitive replicons, or peptide soups are the raw materials on which natural selection can act. Primitiveness does not imply simplicity. Complexity was likely a constant trait for early and modern life, both for the extinguished viruses we will never know anything about, and for those we strive to understand and control (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022It is unlikely that present-day viruses are physically related to the primitive replicons that participated in early life.\u2022However, key features of viruses may be an inheritance of primitive replicons, notably error-prone replication and spread through membrane structures.\u2022At least two ancestral positive selection events might have contributed to the development of life: selection of replicating over nonreplicating polymers, and selection of splitting-prone versus nonsplitting-prone membrane vesicles.\u2022The geological record indicates multiple, brief, and drastic mass extinction events in Earth\u2019s history. Such events anticipate mass extinction of the resident viruses.
