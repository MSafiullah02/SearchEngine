Results: An overview is given on the approaches for the discovery and design concepts of bioactive molecules: a) Natural products derived from plant extracts and their chemically modified derivatives (cardiac glycosides, atropine, cocaine, penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines and actinomycins, pyrethrins and cyclosporin; b) Biochemically active molecules and their synthetic derivatives: acetylcholine, histamine, cortisonelhydrocortisone, indole-3-acetic acid (phenoxyacetic acid herbicides); c) Principles of selective toxicity is discussed exemplified by trimethoprimlmethotrexate, tetracyclines, acylovir, azidothymidine, antifungal agents; d) Metabolism of xenobiotics; e) Exploitation of secondary effects (serendipity); f) Receptor mapping; g) Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies; h) Empirical screening (shotgun approach). Results: Past and present of QSAR is overviewed: a) Historical roots; b) The role of QSAR models in rational drug design, together with a simplified diagram of the steps involved in drug development, including the place of QSAR investigations; c) Classification of QSAR models: structure-cryptic (property-activity) models, structure-implicit (quantum chemical) models, structure-explicit (structure-activity) and structure-graphics (computer graphics) models; d) A non-empirical QSAR model based on quantities introduced for identification of chemical structures, using Szymansk's and Randic's identification (ID) numbers, including applications for alkyltriazines. BioEssays, 1989, 11(5) , 136-141. Results: A review is given on recent observations about receptor structure and the dynamic nature of drug receptors and the significance of receptor dynamics for drug design: a) Receptors are classified according to structure and function (i) ion channels (nicotinic acetylcholine, GABA, Glycine); (ii) G protein linked [adrenergic ( c x ,~) , muscarinic acetylcholine, angiotensin, substance K, rhodopsin]; (iii) tyrosine kinase (insulin, IGF, EGF, PDGF); (iv) guanylate cyclase (atrial natriuretic peptide, speractin); b) Protein conformational changes can be best studied on allosteric proteins whose crystal structure is available (e.g. hemoglobin, aspartate transcarbamylase, tryptophan repressor) (no high resolution of a receptor structure is known); c) Receptor conformational changes can be studied by several indirect approaches (i) spectral properties of covalent or reversibly bound fluorescent reporter groups; (ii) the sensitivity of the receptor to various enzymes; (iii) the sedimentation of chromatographic properties of the receptor; the affinity of binding of radioligands; (iv) the functional state of the receptor; d) There are many unanswered questions: e.g. (i) are there relatively few conformational states for receptors with fluctuations around them or many stable conformational states; (ii) How can static structural information be used in drug design when multiple receptor conformations exist.",

Results: The traditional 2D Wiener number is defined as the sum of the lengths of all possible routes in the molecular graph. Here the length is proposed to be calculated as the real three-dimensional length between atoms: this is the 3D Wiener number. This number has many of the advantageous features of the related and very much studied 2D Wiener number. Additionally, it is highly discriminative and its use in quantitative structure-property relation studies (QSPR) appears to be encouraging, according to the preliminary calculations. Of these the most convincing is the set of statistical parameters for the linear correlation between the experimental and calculated enthalpy functions of 3DW the lower alkanes not shown here. Three different models have been tried and in all cases the 3D Wiener number seemed to be superior to the 2D one as it is reflected in (Eqs.1-6). a) GABA receptors in human mouse, rat and bovine brain tissues, membrane preparations and cellular uptake systems; b) GABA receptors in cat and rat spinal cord preparations; c) Cultured astrocytes.

Certain structural features seemed to correlate with antifungal activity such as the presence of phenolic OH and benzylic hydrogen. It was suggested that the ability of the ortho OH group to form fairly stable intramolecular hydrogen bond may contribute to the greater stability of the Shiff base hnctional group and the higher biological activity of the substances (various subsets required different equations). Results showed that compounds with increasing lipophilicity and electron donating substituents at the 3-and 5-positions have high inhibitory activity.

Zero to six order molecular and cluster connectivity indexes were calculated using computer programs wrinen in FOR-TRAN for IBM PC/XT. The best fitted linear regression model is: [first order rate constant: transport or transformation parameter (mol/Pa. h)]. Results: The QWASI fugacity model describes the fate of a (contaminating) chemical, such as organo-chlorine compounds, pesticides or metals. The lake model consists of water, bottom and suspended sediments, and air. The model includes the following processes: advective flow, volatilization, sediment deposition, resuspension and burial, sediment-water diffusion, wet and dry atmospheric deposition, and degrading reactions. The steady state solution of the model is illustrated by application to PCBs in Lake Ontario using the equilibrium criterion of fugacity as the variable controlling environmental fate of the chemical. The applications are based upon inaccurate data. Use of fugacity is inappropriate for involatile chemicals, such as metals, or ionic species, because fugacities are calculated from a basis of vapor phase concentrations. For these materials the use of the equilibrium concentration activity is more appropriate since activities are calculated from a water phase base. Thus, a new equilibrium criterion, termed the \"aquivalent\" concentration (or equivalent aqueous concentration) is suggested as being preferable. This concentration has the advantage of being applicable in all phases, such as water, air and sediments. The formalism developed in the QWASI approach can also be applied, making possible a ready comparison of the relative rates (and thus, the importance) of diverse environmental fate processes. All these are illustrated by applying the model on a steady state basis to Quant. Struct.-Act. Relat. 9, 234-293 (1990) Abstr. 288-289 261 the PCB example and to the fate of lead in Lake Ontario. The estimated and observed concentrations of PCBs and lead in Lake Ontario agree well: the largest difference in the case of PCBs in rain amounts to a factor of three. In other phases, and especially in the case of lead, the difference is usually less than 30 per cent. Although in order to judge the biological effects of a contaminant it is of fundamental importance to know its transport and transformations, and the present model has been proven to useful to describe this; direct biological implications are not deduced at the present stage. The similar slopes of the equations show that these compounds exert their cytotoxicity primarily by alkylation. While the majority of the tested compounds showed no hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity (ratio awa 1 .O), the 4-N02 and 3-NO2 substituted compounds were more toxic to UV4 cells under hypoxic conditions (ratio = 3.2 for the compound with R = 4-N02), indicating cellular reduction of the nitro-group. The measured hypoxic selectivity of the 3-No2 and 4-N0, substituted compounds was a fraction of the calculated ratio (measured 220 fold and calculated 3500 fold by Eq. 2 between the 4-N02 and 4-NH, substituted compounds). The main reason for the difference between the calculated and measured hypoxic selectivity is suggested to be the low reduction potential of the 4-N02 and 3-NO, groups (E = -500 mV and E = -470 mV, respectively). 19901288",

Multiple regression analysis (MRA) was found to be the most useful for identifying relevant and discarding redundant variables.

Here factor analysis (FA) and principal component analysis was used in conformational studies of 30 various X-ray conformers of DOP/PYR. A correspondence was found between factors identified and RPT, when the rings are considered separately. This fact allows a physical interpretation of the FA results: two or three puckering variables were found for the DOP and PYR rings expressing the absolute amplitudes of the basic pucker modes. Subse-quent FA treatment of the condensed system revealed five conformational variables necessary and sufficicnt to describe the twolring puckering completely. Each of the basic pucker modes defines a unique pattern of conformational variation of the whole two-ring system. The results demonstrate that FA is a powerful technique in analysing condensed poly-ring systems, not amenable to the RPT treatment.",

The application of GEOM was demonstrated by modelling cycbsporin A with and without a limited set of H-bond constrains and with a full NMR data set. In case of cyclosporin A, 100 randomly generated linear analogues of the cyclic structure were formed from the monomers. Geometric cyclization was achieved using DISMAN, resulting in many different but stereochemically correct conformations of cyclosporin A. Superposition of the backbones Of the 10 best cyclic conformers showed RMS deviations between 1.8 A and 3.1 A.

The active analogue approach was applied to model the pheromone receptor by superposing the minimum energy conformations of active structural analogues (HI, IV, V, VI) on ectocarpene and multifidene. The common active conformation of (I) and (11) was extracted by systematic superimposition of the analogues. To explain the function of the double bonds in the pheromones, the presence of a receptor bound metal cation was assumed. Simultaneous optimization,of both structures without and with a receptor bound metal cation resulted in virtually the same conformations.

The final conformations were compared calculating the rms values of their C\" atoms and matching the parameters of the energy minimized (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro), peptide to that of the ideal helix or coiled coil. The similarity of the final conformations obtained by using any two different potentials starting from the same conformation varied from the satisfactory to highly unacceptable.

Results: The atomic resolution structure of an HIV zinc fingerlike domain has been generated by a new NMR-based DG method using 2D NOESY backcalculation. The quality of the structures thus obtained were evaluated on the basis of the consistence with the experimental data (comparison of measured and back-calculated NMR spectra) rather than comparing it tostructural informations from other sources (e.g. X-ray data). The method provided a quantitative measure of consistence between experimental and calculated data which allowed for the use of tighter interproton distance constraints. The folding of the C( l)-F(2)-N(3)-C(4)-G(s)-K(6) residues were found to be virtually identical with the folding of the related residues in the X-ray structure of the iron domain of rubredoxin (RMS values 0.46 and 0.35 A). The backbone folding of the peptide was found to be. significantly different from that of the \"classical\" DNA-binding Zn-finger.

The CM-I and the Intel iPSC hypercube are comparable for smaller sequences, but the CM-I is several times quicker for larger sequences. A fast algorithm by Karlin and his coworkers designed to determine all exact repeats greater than a given length among a set of strings has been tried out on the Encore Multimax/32O. The dynamic programming algorithms are normally used to compare two sequences, but are very expensive for multiple sequences. The Karlin algorithm is well suited to comparing multiple sequences. Calculating a multiple comparison of 11 DNA sequences each 300-400 nucleotides long results in a speedup roughly equal to the number of the processors used. Source: CABIOS 1989, 5(4), 323. Results: A program has been developed for the prediction and display of the secondary structure of proteins using the primary amino acid sequence as database. a) The program calculates and graphically demonstrates four predictive profiles of the proteins allowing interpretation and comparison with the results of other programs; b) As a demonstration the sliding averages of n sequential amino acids were calculated and plotted for four properties of human interleukin 6: (i) plot of the probabilities of a-helix, P-structure and P-turns according to Chou and Fasman; (ii) @-turn index of Chou and Fasman; (iii) plot of the hydrophobicity index of Hopp and Woods; (iv) flexibility index of Karplus and Schulz; c) The regions of primary structure having properties which usually go together agreed reasonably well with each other, i.e. loops and turns with bend probability and hydrophilicity with flexibility.",

Results: The search for threedimensional substructures is becoming widely used in 3D modeling and for the construction of pharmacophores for a variety of biological activities. A system (3DSEARCH) for the definition and search of three-dimensional substructures is described: a) Representation of atom types consists of five fields (i) element (He-U); (ii) number of non hydrogen neighbors (bonded atoms); (iii) number of 'K electrons; (iv) expected number of attached hydrogens; (v) formal charge; (vi) four type of dummy atoms are also used to define geometric points in space (e.g. centroid of a b) Definition of queries (i) definition of spatial relationship between atoms; (ii) matches in atom type (iii) preparation of keys (constituent descriptors); (iv) execution of key search; (v) geometric search including the handling of angleldihedral constrains and takes into account \"excluded volume\"; c) Time tests showed that a search of 3D structures with 3 to 5 atoms in large databases with more than 200,000 entries took only a few minutes (22 -492 s). Results: A database containing about 265,000 compounds in connection tables and 30,000 experimentally determined structures from the Cambridge Structural Database has been transformed into a database of low energy 3D molecular structures using the program CONCORD. The strategy for building the 3D database consisted of the following four steps: a) Generation of approximate 3D coordinates from connection tables (hydrogens were omitted); b) Assignment of atom types from connection table information characterized by five descriptors: (i) element type (He-U); (ii) number of attached non-hydrogen neighbors (0 -8); (iii) number of 'K electrons (0 -2); (iv) calculated number of attached hydrogens (0-4); (v) formal charge ( -1, 0, 1); c) Addition of three types of chemically meaningful dummy atoms for purposes of 3D substructure searching: (i) centroids of planar 5and 6-membered rings; (ii) dummy atoms representing the lone electron pairs; (iii) ring perpendiculars positioned orthogonal to and 0.5 A above and below each planar ring; d) Efficient storage of the resultant coordinate database indexing the compounds with identification number; e) The database can be used among others to deduce pharmacophores essential for biological activity and to search for compounds containing a given pharmacophore.",

Results: EAs of the given compounds have been measured with a pulsed electron high-pressure mass spectrometer in order to examine the substituent effects. Thus, the substituent effects for the u-acceptor/*-acceptor substituents (CFs, COCH3, CHO, CN, NO,) were very similar to those observed for the electron attachment energies of the corresponding substituent nitrobenzenes. This correspondence shows that the extra electron in both systems enters a **-orbital (Fig. 1):[the electron attachment free energy (kcallmol) at 423 K]; [the electron attachment free enthalpy (kcaUmo1) at 423 K30 35 LO L5 50 -AG; ( p -NO& H1 R 1 ( k co I I mo I )",

Data determined: Conformational analysis [low energy conformations of the molecules were calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) calculation (GROMOS package) taking into account stretching, bending and tor-NMR sion contributions, both proper and improper, and adding nonbonded, ?an der Waals and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bond contributions];(The proton and carbon spectra of TSN and SSN obtained by the use of several 1-D and 2-D techniques leading to complete assignments of all resonances).

Quant. Struct.-Act. Relat. 9, 234-293 (1990) Results: An expert system (CRIPES) has been developed for the prediction of RP-HPLC retention indices from molecular structure by combining a set of rules with retention coefficients stored in a database. The method underlying the system is based on the \"alkyl aryl retention index scale\" and aims to improve the reproducibility of prediction and compatibility between various instruments and column materials. The VP-Expert system shell from Microsoft was used for the development. The performance of CRIPES was demonstrated on several subtypes of substituted benzenes (phenacyl halides, substituted arylamines, arylamides and other types). In general the calculated and measured retention indices agreed well but relatively large deviations were observed between the IE and IC values for phenacyl bromides and chlorides, o-and p-bromo anilines, N-methylbenzamide and N,N-dimethylbenzamide and phthalate esters. The extension of the database with further interaction values was regarded as necessary for a consistently high accuracy at prediction.

A direct comparison between the performance of Tripos 5.2 and . Amber using isolated crambin showed that the bond and torsion angles of Tripos 5.2 averaged closer to the crystal structure than the angles calculated by Amber (rms = 0.025 A, 2.97 deg and 13.0 deg for bond lengths, angles, and torsions, respectively, and rms = 0.42 A for heavy atoms).

The test showed that Tripos 5.2 had a systematic error in overestimating the bond lengths of atoms in small rings.
