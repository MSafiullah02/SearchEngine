            "text": "Today, tracking and controlling the spread of a virus is a crucial need for almost all countries. Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show its efficiency and scalability via simulations.",

Thus, it is very beneficial to identify and warn individuals that were in close contact with a carrier right after the carrier is diagnosed. If a country can identify who had close contact with the already diagnosed patients, by sending warnings to its citizens and telling them to self-quarantine themselves, the spread of the virus can be easily controlled. By doing so, individuals that receive such warnings (that they had close contact with one or more diagnosed patients) can take self-measures immediately. This is also economically preferred instead of completely shutting down a country.",

These contact histories are then used to determine if an individual was in close contact with a diagnosed patient in the past few weeks, and if so, the individual receives a warning.

In [10] [11] [12] , aggregate location paths (of diagnosed patients) are sent to the individuals and individual gets notification if they were in close proximity of a diagnosed patient. This results in another privacy vulnerability since individuals can observe the paths of diagnosed patients. Even though only the aggregate location paths are shared by the app, if the number of diagnosed patients is few in a given area, this may result in a significant privacy leak for the whereabouts of diagnosed individuals. As opposed to these approaches, in this work, we propose a scheme that protects the privacy of diagnosed individuals as well as the healthy ones.",

For the sake of generality, one can also assume multiple local databases for the health authority (e.g., located in different geographical regions). The health authority keeps the identities of the diagnosed patients and it does not want this information to be learnt by other parties. Individuals keep their local (physical) contact histories in their smart phones and they do not want this information to be observed by other parties (including the health authority). Also, when an individual receives a warning about a contact with a diagnosed patient, the individual wants to make sure that no other party can observe this warning. We consider a semi-honest attacker model for the parties that involve in the protocol. That is, each party in the system follows the protocol honestly but they may be curious to learn sensitive information of the other parties. On the other hand, individuals may try to learn the identities of diagnosed patients or the health authority may try to learn the contact histories of the individuals. As we will discuss in detail later, the proposed algorithm protects the parties against these threats. Finally, we assume all communications between parties (between smart phones of two individuals or between an individual and the database of the health authority) are encrypted, and hence robust against eavesdroppers.",

As a result of this interaction, the new record in the contact history of A is the ID of B.

For instance, knowing the IMEI number of a target person, an attacker may construct its local contact list only from the ID of that target, and hence learn the diagnosis of the target. To prevent such an attack, we consider two options: (i) make sure the local contact histories of individuals are stored in such a way that data cannot be accessed or modified by the individuals (e.g., local contact history can be encrypted in the device by the key of the health authority or contact history can be stored in a storage for which the individual does not have read/write permission). Or, (ii) each new contact B of an individual A also includes a digital signature that is signed by a centralized authority (e.g., the telecom operator). To do so, if individuals A and B spend a certain amount of time within close proximity of each other (measured as discussed before), they both send the contact request to the operator, the operator signs and sends back the signed contact record to both parties, and each party keeps the contact records and the corresponding signature together. This way, an attacker cannot fake new contacts in its local contact history. The validity of these signatures are then verified when the local contact history of an individual is compared with the diagnosed patients in the health authority's database (we discuss this in detail in Section 6).",

Size of this intersection reveals the number of diagnosed people with whom A had been in close proximity in the previous a few weeks. As the size of the intersection increases, the risk of individual A being infected also increases. The proposed algorithm provides the result of this intersection to individual A as a warning message. Using the warning, the individual may take early precautions (e.g., have a test or quarantine themselves). To compute this intersection in a privacy-preserving way, we use the private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocol, in which parties that are involved in the protocol obfuscate their inputs (sensitive information) and compute the result of this intersection. Eventually, only individual A learns the result of the intersection and the health authority does not learn any information about the contact history of individual A or the result of the intersection. We also make sure that individual A does not learn anything about the database content of the health authority (e.g., IDs of diagnosed patients). We provide the details of this protocol in the following. Figure 4 illustrates the details of the proposed PSI-CA based protocol between an individual (client) and the health authority (server). As input to the protocol, client has its local contact list and server has the list of positive diagnosed patients (steps c.1 and s.1 in the figure).",

To prevent this, one option is to record each contact along with a corresponding digital signature from a centralized authority, such as the telecom operator (as discussed in Section 4.2). Here, we describe how such signatures can be used when computing the intersection between the individual and the health authority's database. For this, we propose using the authorized private set intersection (APSI) protocol, in which the entries in the local contact history of an individual are digitally signed by a centralized authority and the validity of these signatures are verified by the health authority during the protocol. We discuss the details of this APSI-based protocol in the following. Figure 5 illustrates the details of APSI-based protocol between an individual (client) and the health authority (server) in the semi-honest setting. First, a common input (N, e, g, H, H ) is determined for the protocol. N = pq is the RSA modulus, where p and q are safe primes. e is the public exponent. g is a random element in Z * N . Also, H and H are the hash functions, modeled as random oracles. All computations are done in mod N. Both server and the client have the same input sets as in PSI-CA protocol. In addition to these sets, client also has a list of RSA signatures (\u03c3 i )-s, where \u03c3 i = H(c i ) d mod N (steps c.1 and s.1 in the figure).",

It is worth noting that the communication cost of the individual scales linearly with the size of the individual's local contact history and the health authority can send the same message to all individuals (it does not need to send a separate 4GB data to each individual, and hence the communication cost of the health authority can be optimized).",
