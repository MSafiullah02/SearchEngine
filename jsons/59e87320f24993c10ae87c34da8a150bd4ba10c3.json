Similarly, S. pneumoniae was greatest in children 3-5 years old (71% 3-5yrs; 58% 6-15 years; 25% 16-20 years; p = 0.008). Children 3-10 years old presented with fever more than children 11-20 years old (22% vs 7%; p = 0.02) and were more often diagnosed with pneumonia (28% vs 4%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Younger children had increased fever, pneumonia, and detection of Influenza A and S. pneumoniae. These data support the need for influenza and pneumococcus vaccination in early childhood in Haiti.",

In that same study, analysis of bacterial agents showed high detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae leading the authors to conclude that vaccination efforts for Streptococcus pneumoniae will be beneficial.

The Christianville Foundation partners with University of Florida (UF) to address public health challenges in the Haitian community. These schools were previously described with one having pre-K through 12th grade with approximately 800 students, and three schools having pre-K through the 6th grade with 130-180 students each (Beau De Rochars et al., 2015) . School clinic staff included one physician and two nurses who evaluated and managed patients as per standard clinic procedures, and obtained a nasal swab from each participant as part of routine clinical care using the BD universal viral transport kit (BD Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Given the lack of access to X-ray or pulse oximetry, criteria to obtain swab was based on clinical criteria of history of fever and respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis of upper vs lower respiratory infection was based on physical exam. Swabs were initially stored at \u00c020 C with testing anticipated soon after collection at the UF laboratory in Haiti; due to technical difficulties, de-identified coded swabs were transported in bulk on dry ice to UF and then stored at \u00c080 C until processed. When laboratory studies were completed, clinic staff retrospectively linked a limited clinical data set with results. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Florida IRB.",

This low level of detection may have been due to initial storage of nasal swabs at \u00c020 C which has been found to decrease RSV detection (Nunes and Moura, 2006) and our patients being 3-20 years old when the highest rate of the RSV positivity are typically among children 2 years of age. Low detection of RSV was also seen in a study of 4,242 pediatric patients that showed detection of RSV infection at 3.4 \u00c07.2% in older children 3-14 years of age compared to 18.7-29.2% in 4 months to 2 years old (Liu et al., 2014) . It is possible that by the time Haitian children are 3 years of age, the risk for significant infection has greatly declined in comparison to those in less resource poor countries where RSV and HMPV can continue to cause significant disease in those <5 years old. Future studies on RSV and HMPV that included children <3 years of age in both outand in-patient setting could help better understand their clinical impact.",

Despite this decrease, the high colonization rates and associated risk for infection strongly supports introduction of S. pneumoniae and continuation of H. influenzae B vaccine in those <5 years of age (WHO, 2013b; WHO, 2012) .

The lack of corresponding tests for the diagnosis of pneumonia such as chest x-ray, pulse oximetry, or blood culture is due to lack of resources in the rural clinic setting. Another resource related issue is the skewing of the patient population to the younger age group since only one out of the four schools provides middle school or high school education. Also there are gaps in data during the vacations and holidays when schools are closed such as for winter vacation in December which may present a bias in the data. Lastly, since the school clinic was in location A, children who were ill in other locations enrolled on the study were less able to travel to the clinic which likely presented a bias based on resource distribution.",
