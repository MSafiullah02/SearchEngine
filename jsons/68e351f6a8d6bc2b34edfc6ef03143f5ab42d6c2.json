In general, most viruses gain entry into the lungs via the conducting airways. In nonprimate mammalians these infections are most prominent in the cranioventral lung lobes because of their horizontal position.

In many species there are strains of the virus that specifi cally target the respiratory system including dogs, cats, cattle, horses, and chickens. In these species, the virus can target the upper but also the lower respiratory tract, predisposing the host to secondary bacterial infection through impairment of lung defenses.",

A pattern of numerous coalescing nodules that are pale white and moderately fi rm ( Fig. 24.4 ) is the most common. In some cases, the growth pattern is that of multiple discrete nodules (Fig. 24.5 ) . Histologically, the lungs show severe interstitial fi brosis, accompanied by a mixed infl ammatory infi ltrate. The majority of the infl ammatory cells are lymphocytes, as well as macrophages, neutrophils, and occasionally eosinophils. The alveolar spaces contain moderate numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Macrophages with eosinophilic cytoplasm and large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Williams et al. 2007 ) can be seen. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) may cause vasculitis leading to abortion, stillbirth, encephalomyelopathy, and respiratory disease. Fatal nonneurological EHV-1 infection in young adult horses does occur but is rare.

They are pathogenic to various species including cats, cattle, ground squirrels, guinea pigs, horses, mice, monkeys, sheep, and swine. They affect the lung as well as multiple other organs. Rarely, the lung may be the only affected organ (Hoover and Thacker 1979 ) . CMV infections are most often latent, but under appropriate circumstances, they may result in severe and often fatal infections. In monkeys several patterns of lesions with focal, diffuse, and a mixed pattern of disease have been reported. The lungs with the diffuse pattern of disease seen in monkeys (Baskin 1987 ) and sheep (Hoover and Thacker 1979 ) are heavy, wet, and consolidated. Microscopically, focal lesions show interstitial thickening and prominent hypertrophic pneumocytes. The alveolar spaces contain proteinaceous exudate with macrophages, neutrophils, and multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear basophilic inclusion bodies (Figs. 24.10 and 24.11 ) and occasionally necrotic foci. Microscopic changes in the diffuse forms are similar to those seen in the focal pattern but are generally more severe with chronic organizational changes (Baskin 1987 ) .

The pneumonia is a bronchointerstitial pneumonia with presence of serofi brinous exudate and a mixed population of infl ammatory cells in the conducting airways and the alveolar spaces. There is also diffuse alveolar injury with formation of hyaline membranes, hemorrhages, and proliferation of type II pneumocytes (Fig. 24.20 ) .

Immunocompetent mice are susceptible. In the initial stage of infection, the virus is only mildly cytopathic. During the immune phase of the disease when cytotoxic T cells destroy the virus-infected cells, there is necrosis of the respiratory epithelium.
