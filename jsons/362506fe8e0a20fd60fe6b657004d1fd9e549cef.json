This is due to the introduction of large medical text/image datasets. Generating radiology coherent paragraphs that do more than traditional medical image annotation, or single sentencebased description, has been the subject of recent academic attention. This presents a more practical and challenging application and moves towards bridging visual medical features and radiologist text. So far, the most common approach has been to utilize publicly available datasets and develop DL models that integrate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis alongside recurrent neural networks (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). This is an area of research that we anticipate will grow in the near future. We focus our investigation on the following critical challenges: understanding radiology text/image structures and datasets, applying DL algorithms (mainly CNN and RNN), generating radiology text, and improving existing DL based models and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we include a critical discussion and future research recommendations. This survey will be useful for researchers interested in DL, particularly those interested in applying DL to radiology reporting.

This was inspired by recent work in generating text descriptions of natural images through inter-modal connections between language and visual features [1] . Traditionally, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems interpret medical images automatically to offer an objective diagnosis and assist radiologists [2] . Unlike CAD, DL is able to learn useful features that move beyond the limitations of radiology detection [3] . For example, DL has been applied to mammography to discriminate between breast cancer and microcalcification [4] , on ultrasounds to differentiate breast lesions (malignant and benign), and on CT lung scans to classify pulmonary nodules [5] . Researchers [4, 5] noted a significant performance increase in DL models over conventional CAD systems. From a radiologist standpoint, DL helps to improve patient safety by offering more accurate diagnoses, obtains additional diagnostic criteria by generating unobservable data from imaging features, and increases efficiency by performing various tasks automatically [6] .",

As a result, many health-care systems outsource the task of medical image analysis. For example, there are many teleradiology companies in India [12] .

The findings section is the most crucial part of the report as it describes medical observations of normal/abnormal features in a presumptive order [20] . Figure 1 shows an example in the form of an IU X-ray [21] dataset. Here, each report is associated with two chest X-ray images.",

            "text": "A generated radiologist report must follow critical protocols including the correct use of medical terms to describe normal/abnormal diagnoses. They must also include supporting visual evidence in the form of detected disease location and key attributes of the image. There are several lexicons utilized in writing radiology reports including Metathesaurus 1 [22] , RadLex 2 [23] , and medical subject headings (MeSH) 3 . Metathesaurus [22] is a collection of more than five million concept names and a million biomedical terms from over one-hundred controlled vocabulary systems. In contrast, RadLex contains more radiology-specific terms than Metathesaurus including imaging methods and equipment. Furthermore, MeSH offers comprehensive controlled vocabulary created by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) to index scientific journal articles and books. For example, [24] utilized MeSH terms to mine reports in IU X-rays [21] . However, brain tumors and lung diseases do not have a fixed standardized lexicon. Instead, they have a semi-standardized description system. The use of DL has shown promising results in generating radiology reports from images [20, [25] [26] [27] . First, researchers generated a short descriptive sentence of a radiology image using only the image features.Then, they attempted to produce more informative reports with multiple sentences. However, this introduced new challenges in content selection and ordering. Using this method, radiology reports could include information that cannot be detected from image features, such as the nationality of the patient [24] . On the other hand, this text-based DL algorithm is insufficient as it does not include specific image labels.",

To enhance standards, digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) was introduced in 1993. It included advanced report and result features [41] . Where DICOM has assisted with many image processing procedures, PACS is an e-system mainly used for the acquisition of medical images. From DL perspective, radiology images are pre-processed differently due to the varied processor and memory restrictions. Some images, such as Xrays, are two-dimensional (2D) while others such as CT and MRI scans are three-dimensional (3D). Currently, DL models that are trained on simple 2D images are more successful than 3D images which add an extra dimension to the problem [42] . However, experience needs to be gained in applying DL to X-rays because they are 2D projections of a 3D human body [43] . In other words, DL algorithms may need to be adjusted to handle the physiological structures that lie on top of each other in the X-rays. Significantly, DL, in particular CNN, can process an input of 2D and 3D images with only minor adjustments. After all, deep learning in radiology images is still an area of active ongoing research.",

To allow practitioners to rapidly implement DL solutions for image analysis tasks, NiftyNet 11 [49] features an open source framework for many medical imaging CNN algorithms under the Apache License. Several surveys have introduced the role of DL algorithms in medical image analysis, focusing on CNN [12, 13] . [50] classifies DL models based on application area, including cardiovascular, neurology, mammography, microscopy, dermatology, gastroenterology, and pulmonary applications. Table 1 compares publicly available radiology image datasets with relevant reports in the medical informatics domain. These include the following: the Indiana University chest X-ray (IU X-ray) [21] , ChestX-ray14 [34] , MIMIC-CXR [33] , pathology detection in chest radiographs (PadChest) [37] , the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM), and the pathology education informational resource (PEIR). Researchers have employed these multimodal medical databases for developing and evaluating DL models. Nevertheless, there are few large and accessible datasets adequate for developing CNN models. In addition, researchers conduct experiments using different database subsets. This makes it difficult to compare the performance of their proposed approaches.",

The IU Xray [21] collection consists of 7,470 chest X-rays with 3,955 radiology reports available through OpenI. OpenI is an open-source collection of literature and biomedical images. It contains IU X-ray, 2,064 orthopedic illustrations, and more than three million images from PubMed and the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Researchers [20, [24] [25] [26] [27] have used this dataset to demonstrate how their proposed DL models label and describe the diseases associated with the images. However, data in IU X-ray comes from fully anonymized reports in two hospitals. As a result, some keywords, findings and images are missing. ChestX-ray14 [34] is from the national institute of health (NIH) clinical center. It is an open access chest X-ray dataset that includes 112,120 Xray images with fourteen thorax disease labels (atelectasis, consolidation, infiltration, pneumothorax, edema, emphysema, fibrosis, effusion, pneumonia, pleural thickening, cardiomegaly, nodule, mass, and hernia). These labels were mined from the original radiologist reports. However, the complete text reports are not publicly available.",

Leaky ReLU is an extension of ReLU that outputs small negative numbers if the inputs are negative. If not, it produces the same outputs as ReLU. Researchers tend to begin with ReLU and then apply other activation functions if they do not obtain optimal results. All traditional CNN activation functions output a single result for a single input except Softmax. Instead, Softmax produces multiple outputs.

ImageNet is a project that aims to create an enormous visual database that can be utilized by researchers in the field of visual object recognition [69] . It should be noted that ImageNet runs ILSVRC, an annual contest where software programmers classify and detect objects and scenes. In 2012, [61] noted how AlexNet was the first model to considerably improve image classification performance. It obtained a 16.4% error rate using the ImageNet dataset. This model minimized the overfitting problem using data augmentation and dropout procedures. Two remarkable models were then proposed in 2014: the VGG-16 (7.4% error rate), which reduced the spatial size of the input in each layer, and GoogLeNet (6.67% error rate), which permitted procedures such as pooling and convolutional to run in parallel to each other. AlexNet uses eight convolutional layers, 650,000 neurons (60,000,000 parameters) and has an error rate of 16.4%. In contrast, VGG-16 consist of 16 convolutional layers, 133,000,000 parameters and 7.4% error rates [70] . It is clear that VGG-16 is a significantly deeper model than AlexNet, which is why its error rate is lower.",

This is because most images are clustered into three groups as they were derived from text modalities only (approximately 780,000 reports). On the other hand, [59] created the LDPO model, which formed clusters from text reports as well as image cues to offer a more visually coherent and balanced method in terms of clusters. As such, LDPO is an iterative system that extracts deep CNN features based on finetuned radiologist topic labels and mutual information shared between discovered clusters. Afterwards, the framework either stops the iteration and outputs optimized clustering or inputs the refined cluster labels into the next iteration to fine-tune the CNN model. At the end, NLP is applied to the radiology reports to count and rank the frequency of each word. This process allocates the most common words, which are then used as the keyword labels for each cluster. To evaluate the system, a board of certified radiologists reviewed the resultant keywords and sampled images. The results of applying the LDPO model to discovery clusters were found to be visually coherent and highly balanced clusters. Nevertheless, the looped property is specific to deep CNN classification-clustering methods as other kinds of classifiers cannot learn satisfactory image characteristics simultaneously.",

A reliable reporting system may require tens of millions of image/text samples which are not yet readily available [14] .

To date, there are few medical datasets that are large and accessible enough to train multimodal deep CNN. Improving the quantity and quality of radiology data remains an ongoing task.",

For example, the healthy cases in the IU X-ray chest X-Ray dataset consisted of 2,696 images (37%) compared to the 840 images (12%) that represented common diseases and 655 images (9%) that showed less common diseases. [24] attempted to address this issue by training CNN with different regularization methods including batch normalization and data dropout. In addition, it is challenging to automate labels for medical images as radiologist reports often include ambiguous words. This includes disease prediction rather than if it is present or not [19] . It should be noted that it is difficult to compare various models as researchers conduct their experiments using diverse and sometimes private datasets. Researchers consider DL as a black box that takes an input, such as a medical image, and generates an output to state a conclusion (e.g. \"there is a 0.8 probability of melanoma\") without clear explanations [14, 105] . This is unacceptable in the medical domain as radiologist need to provide findings as well as underlying justifications. For instance, researchers may attempt to provide the rationale behind the radiologist's description using their proposed models. Considerably more research will need to be conducted to offer reasonable explanations for DL model outcomes.",
