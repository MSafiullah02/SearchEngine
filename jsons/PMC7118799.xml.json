Of particular importance is the possibility of transmission of infectious diseases to the recipients of these cell products. Any microbial contamination of the donor's biological products or introduced during manufacturing process can potentially present a serious hazard to recipients even if it is not an overt pathogen. The most common potential forms of contamination (e.g. bacteria (include mycoplasma), yeast, fungi) can be readily assessed on a routine basis (European Pharmacopeia, 2004a, European Pharmacopeia, 2004b, Cobo et al., 2005). However, viral contamination of cell cultures and feeder cells, which is a common risk in all biotechnological products derived from the cell lines, is the most challenging and potentially serious outcome to address, due to the difficulty involved in virus detection and the potential to cause serious disease in recipients of these cell products (Cobo et al., 2005).",

There is evidence that certain mouse viruses, like Hantaan virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and reovirus-3 have all been detected in mouse colonies (Kraft and Meyer, 1990) and these viruses have notably caused serious infection, and even fatalities in laboratory workers (Lloyd and Jones, 1986, Mahy et al., 1991) and may also be transmitted in cell lines and reagents (Nicklas et al., 1993). Furthermore, in the guidelines released by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA, 1997), there is evidence that other mouse viruses like Hantaan virus, reovirus-3, Sendai virus, lactic dehydrogenase virus and LCMV are capable of infecting humans or primates. Finally, an additional group of murine viruses like ectromelia virus, Minute virus of mice, mouse adenovirus, mouse cytomegalovirus, mouse rotavirus, pneumonia virus of mice, Toolan virus and Kilham rat virus, while not known to cause human disease, are capable of replying in vitro in cells of human or primate origin (EMEA, 1997).",

The screening should apply to testing for human feeder cells for clinical use, the same as the present regulations that require the screening of cell and tissue products from donors for a spectrum of viruses which cause serious human infectious diseases (UK MSBT, 2000, AATB, 2002). Virological screening should firstly be carried out for HIV-1/2, hepatitis B and hepatitis C; moreover, recently, the products for transfusion containing cellular material have been tested for the cell associated organisms such as hCMV and HTLV-I/II (Consensus Document, 1999), although tests for hepatitis A and hepatitis E should also be recommended in such products. Other potentially viral agents that could be contaminants of cells from healthy individuals include human herpesviruses (HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes simplex virus), parvovirus B19, TTV virus and human polyomaviruses (JC and BK virus), and these viruses remain latent and detectable in humans from early childhood. The risk of transmission of these microorganisms is considered extremely low, so tests for them are not currently required for transplantation. However, the oncogenic risk of viral contamination must also be considered because some of these agents have been involved in human cancers (Takeuchi et al., 1996, Garbuglia et al., 2003).",

It is important to use sensitive assays, such as EIA, immunofluorescence, Western blot assays, etc. However, research has shown that the detection of antibodies exclusively runs the risk of samples for tests being taken during an antibody-negative window period of these infections, where an individual has been exposed to viral infection and indeed can be viremic (Hitzler and Runkel, 2001). This finding has led to the introduction of nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which the presence of a virus can be observed by means of the amplification of sequences in the viral genome. The addition of nucleic acid test methods to screening of tissue donors, and to the testing of derived cell lines, should reduce the risk of these infections among recipients of stem cell lines (Zou et al., 2004).",

Real-time quantitative PCR is a homogeneous method that includes both amplification and analysis with no need for slab gels, radioactivity or sample manipulation. Reaction products are detected with a fluorescence detection system consisting of a light-emitting diode that delivers excitation light to each reaction tube and an optical unit with three detection channels to record emitted light. The fluorescence of DNA dyes or probes is monitored each cycle during PCR. The simplest system for detection of real-time PCR products uses the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green, which fluoresces when its binds to double-stranded DNA. These methods have several important advantages over conventional PCR. Since the accumulation of PCR product is monitored in the reaction tube, no separate detection method, such as gel electrophoresis, is required, thus shortening the effective assay markedly. Furthermore, the possibility of contamination by amplicons is decreased because the systems are closed, with no handling of the reaction contents after completion of PCR. The use of multiple fluorescent dyes with different emission wavelengths makes it possible to perform multiplex reactions with simultaneous amplification of more than one product. Moreover, other molecular methods have been described and introduced for the viral diagnosis, like nucleic acid probes (Denniston et al., 1986), Branched DNA signal amplification (Urdea et al., 1991), nested PCR (Erlich et al., 1991) and multiplex PCR (Dineva et al., 2005), etc. Real-time multiplex PCR can analyze multiple viruses simultaneously within a single reaction. The main advantages of multiplexing over single-target analysis are the ability to provide internal controls, lower reagent costs and preservation of precious samples. Multiplexing can be particularly important when there is a need to analyze several viruses from the samples. There are several assays that use a real-time multiplex RT-PCR technology for diagnosis of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV-1 virus (Candotti et al., 2004). There are other authors who have described several assays using this procedures for retroviruses (Vet et al., 1999) and herpesviruses (O'Neill et al., 2003).",

A useful test for eliminating false positives is to compare the results from both a DNA template and a ribonucleic acid (RNA) template because cellular DNA polymerase and viral reverse transcriptase have different template preferences.

Use of probes representing all possible nucleotide sequence variations within a target sequence allows rapid determination of nucleotide sequence (Pease et al., 1994). High density arrays, which may have thousands of individual probes per cm2, are referred to as microarrays. These microarrays on silicon surfaces are therefore known as \u201cDNA chips\u201d.

The RNA expression of human CMV in cell culture in the presence or absence of cycloheximide or ganciclovir was analyzed with an array of oligonucleotides representing human CMV ORFs (Chambers et al., 1999).

In contrast to many other antibodies used for detection of prion protein, 1E4 has a broad species reactivity. Detection of prion protein has been demonstrated with Western blot for humans, cattle, sheep, deer, mice and hamsters. Most of the currently available TSE tests are based on the fact that PrPc, normal prion protein, is digested by proteinase k, whereas PrPSc, TSE specific prion, is relatively resistant to degradation by proteases. The special feature of 1E4 is that its epitope is almost hidden on non-digested bovine PrPSc, but after proteinase K digestion, the epitope becomes available resulting in a significant increased detection. After digestion with protease K, 1E4 binds to PrPSc with high affinity, whereas it has a low affinity for non-digested PrPSc. The 1E4 antibody has been tested in a broad variety of methods, such as Western blot, RIA, ELISA, EliBlot, FACS and immunohistochemistry.",

This method could allow a rapid conversion of excess PrPc into a protease resistant PrPSc-like form. In this method, aggregates formed when PrPSc is incubated with PrPc are disrupted by sonication to generate multiple smaller units for the continued formation of new PrPSc. After cycling amplification, more than 97% of the protease resistant PrP present in the sample correspond to newly converted protein. This method could be applied to diagnose the presence of undetectable prion infectious agent in tissues and biological fluids. In this respect, recently, Castilla et al. (2005) have been the first to detect the resistant-protein PrPSc biochemically in hamster blood by means of the cyclic amplification of protein misfolding. This procedure enables detection of prions in blood with 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The high level of sensitivity and specificity indicated that this assay offers promise for the design of a sensitive biochemical test for blood diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The implementation of a similar blood-detection procedure for humans and culture-detection method for stem cell lines undoubtedly contributes to minimizing the risk of infection with agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.",
