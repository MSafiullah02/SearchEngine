The efforts towards understanding other risk factors in TB\u2014such as respiratory viruses, helminths [6], and bacteria [7]\u2014are becoming increasingly important [8]. Evidence from experimental mouse models suggests that respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses may play a pathogenic role in individuals with tuberculous disease by negatively affecting immunity against M. tuberculosis\n[9]. The effect of respiratory viruses on TB may mimic the development of bacterial pneumonia immediately after an infection with respiratory viruses [10]. Studies of the lung microbiota (the community of microorganisms in the airways), which have focused on respiratory bacterial populations, suggest that there are differences in respiratory bacterial species populations among patients with and without TB, among new and recurrent TB patients, as well as among those in whom TB treatment has failed [7].",

Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and HIV infection were used to assess the associations between respiratory pathogens and clinical presentations of TB at the time of recruitment among TB patients, with the following outcome variables: severe TB score (score of \u22656) versus mild (score of 1\u20135), high sputum bacterial load (sputum AFB smear microscopy of \u22652+) versus low bacterial load, and presence versus absence of lung infiltrations and cavitations (chest x-ray findings).

We detected respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs using a highly sensitive and specific molecular technique [21], whereas the study from Indonesia [20] measured influenza virus antibody titres which also detect patients with previous exposure to influenza viruses.

A particular strength of the study is that potentially confounding and unmeasured risk factors were minimized by studying patients and controls who lived in the same households. A limitation of the study is its undifferentiated attention to respiratory viruses because of small numbers which precluded assessment of the clinical effects of individual viruses. However, we presume that all respiratory viruses have similar levels of immunomodulation, and thus we could combine all respiratory viruses together.",

However, respiratory bacterial species were more frequently detected in household contact controls than in TB patients. Our findings suggest that TB patients co-infected with both respiratory viruses and respiratory bacteria have severe TB disease. Further research should focus on the pathogenic role of respiratory pathogens in high-TB-incidence settings and their effects on clinical and treatment outcomes.",
