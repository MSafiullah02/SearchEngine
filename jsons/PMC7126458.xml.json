As a safe and effective formulation, it also can relieve idiopathic sweating and augment appetite in end-stage cancer patients (Chiu et al., 2009). It has been used for preventing viral infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome (Lau et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2006), and is reported to have immunoregulatory and beneficial effects in allergic rhinitis, asthma, and dermatitis models (Fang et al., 2005, Makino et al., 2004, Makino et al., 2005, Nakatsukasa et al., 2009). Phytochemical and serum pharmacochemical analyses have found that YPFS contains isoflavones from Radix Astragali and chromones from Radix Saposhnikoviae as major constituents (Huang et al., 2008, You, 2007, Zhao et al., 2011, Zheng et al., 2011). In Radix Astragali, astragalosides have been identified as potential bioactive compounds via intestinal absorption and cell extraction studies (Xu et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2008). Furthermore, numerous pharmacological studies have shown anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities for the constituents astragalosides, astragaloside IV, calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (Wang et al., 2008, Xue et al., 2000, Yin et al., 2010, Yu et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2006). These glycosides (\nFig. 1) may explain the effectiveness of YPFS.",

As reflected by pharmacokinetic profiles, it is accepted that poor bioavailability, low serum concentration, and short retention time indicates that a drug will not be effective. However, according to our preliminary experiments and related literature, traces of astragaloside IV, calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside, formononetin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside, and prim-O-glucosylcimifugin are in rat plasma (Li et al., 2012, Wen et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2007), and cycloastragenol, formononetin, calycosin, and cimifugin are metabolized from their glycosides in vivo (Chen et al., 2011, Li et al., 2012, Yung et al., 2012). These aglycones (Fig. 1) have shown higher biological activities than their glycoside counterparts. For example, cycloastragenol, the common aglycone of astragalosides, has been identified as a telomerase activator and has been used to improve the proliferative response of CD8+T lymphocytes in HIV-infected patients (Fauce et al., 2008, R\u00edos, 2010, Yung et al., 2012). Calycosin, one of the metabolites of calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside, exhibits more potent antioxidant and antiviral activities than its parent form and other metabolites (Chen et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2005).",

The pharmacokinetic parameters terminal half-life (HL\u03bbz), maximum concentration in plasma (C\nmax), and the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve (AUC) from dosing time extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-\u221e) showed a trend of dose-dependence towards the detected constituents cycloastragenol, calycosin, GMV and cimifugin in YPFS, based on the doses administered orally (10, 20 and 40 g/kg;\nFig. 4,\nTable 5). Formononetin, calycosin, and GMV were rapidly absorbed, achieving C\nmax in less than 30 min. Cycloastragenol was detected after 0.5 h in plasma and with time to C\nmax (i.e., T\nmax) at around 12 h, a long mean residence time (MRT) of 17 h. We speculated that the astragalosides were hydrolyzed to cycloastragenol in the intestine or stomach, and then cycloastragenol was absorbed into the circulation. An unknown peak (17.2 min) was found in the same selected ion monitoring (513) channel one minute after the cycloastragenol position. It displayed similar pharmacokinetic behaviors as cycloastragenol. This unknown peak will be identified in a further study. Cimifugin showed multiple absorption peaks, and among all the detected constituents the concentration in plasma was particularly high (Fig. 4). This might be because the YPFS contained free cimifugin as well as its precursor.",

Previously it was shown that astragalosides from Radix Astragali have low permeability in vitro and poor bioavailability in vivo (Gu et al., 2004, Wen et al., 2008). However, its aglycone cycloastragenol can be absorbed through intestinal epithelium efficiently (Zhu et al., 2010). This is similar to prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, 4\u2032-O-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and their aglycone cimifugin (Li et al., 2010, Xue et al., 2000, Zhao et al., 2011). It has been reported that changes in telomere lengths are relevant to immune function (Weng, 2012), and cycloastragenol upregulates telomerase activity (Fauce et al., 2008, R\u00edos, 2010, Yung et al., 2012). Furthermore, cimifugin inhibits nitric oxide production and contributes to the analgesic efficacy of Radix Saposhnikoviae (Okuyama et al., 2001, Wang et al., 1999). Taken together, cycloastragenol and cimifugin have demonstrated good pharmacokinetic behavior in vivo. Therefore, cycloastragenol and cimifugin may be related to the effect of YPFS in diseases of the respiratory and immune systems. Moreover, these two metabolites may be valuable as immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory agents. However, further study is required to confirm the association between cycloastragenol, cimifugin, and YPFS and pharmacological effect, as such bioactive metabolites could be potential drugs.",
