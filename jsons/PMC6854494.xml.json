Coronaviruses (CoVs) have repeatedly made species jumps between animal species (e.g., swine acute diarrhea syndrome [SADS] coronavirus from bats to swine) (1) and from animals to humans (2). Two human coronaviruses (HCoVs), 229E and OC43, now endemic in the human population, emerged from camels and bovines, respectively, within the past few hundred years (2, 3). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus emerged from bats via intermediate mammalian hosts in live game animal markets in Guangdong to spread to over 25 countries across 5 continents, causing illness in almost 8,000 people and leading to almost 800 deaths (4\u20136). The ability of coronaviruses to make interspecies jumps is facilitated by complex virus-host interactions. The high frequency of virus genetic recombination represents one mechanism by which the virus adapts to a new host.",

            "text": "Virus genetic recombination is frequently observed in coronaviruses and other positive-sense RNA viruses. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a clade A beta-CoV, is a well-studied example of homologous recombination, with up to 25% of its progeny in infected cells being demonstrated to be recombinants (7). High frequency of recombination is believed to be contributed by the large genome size, the intrinsic template-switching property of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during replication, and the abundance of subgenomic RNA strands for template switching (8, 9). The role of RdRp in RNA recombination has been shown in poliovirus, where a single amino acid residue mutation in the RdRp of poliovirus can result in a decrease in RNA recombination frequency (10). The activity of exoribonucleases (ExoN) in replicase nonstructural protein 14 (nsp 14) of CoVs that constitutes the proofreading activity of genome replication has been suggested to be a potential regulator of RNA recombination (11). The presence of group-specific genes in CoVs is assumed to be a result of heterologous recombination, which involves exchange of nonhomologous viral or cellular RNAs. The hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene that is expressed only in clade A beta-CoVs is believed to have been acquired from influenza C virus through such heterologous recombination (12).",

            "text": "In 2012, a novel respiratory pathogen, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from a patient with severe respiratory illness in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (13). It was a zoonotic virus found in dromedary camels which occasionally transmits to human (14\u201316). MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels in the Middle East as well as in Africa, with the greatest virus diversity found in Africa (17). Circulation of multiple lineages of clade B MERS-CoV in dromedary camels eventually resulted in the emergence of a recombinant lineage 5 virus that caused major outbreaks during 2015 within both Saudi Arabia and South Korea, following introduction of the virus by a returning traveler (18). Recent studies have shown that two other coronaviruses, alphacoronavirus dromedary camel coronavirus 229E (DcCoV-229E) and beta-CoV dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 (DcCoV-HKU23), cocirculate in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia (18, 19). The cocirculation of at least three coronaviruses within camels provides an opportunity for the emergence of novel emerging infections via recombination. It is therefore important to look for evidence of recombination between coronaviruses cocirculating in dromedary camels because such recombination might have contributed to the emergence of MERS-CoV and might contribute to the future emergence of viruses of zoonotic and epidemic potential. Here, we report the genetic diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 in the African camel population and identify several recombination events that have taken place with clade A beta-CoVs, including recombination with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and with more-distant species such as rabbit coronavirus (RbCoVHKU14) and rodent coronavirus (RodentCoV). We carried out our studies in West Africa (Nigeria), East Africa (Ethiopia), and North Africa (Morocco) because over 70% of the global population of dromedaries are found in Africa and this is where the greatest diversity of these dromedary coronaviruses is likely to be found and where MERS-CoV emerged.",

The observed diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 was comparable to that of BCoV, suggesting that the two viruses were introduced into their animal hosts at similar points in time.

In addition to the 6 full genomes, 4 more virus sequences with complete RdRp, S, and N genes representing DcCoV-HKU23 isolates from Ethiopia (CAC1320 and CAC1452) and Morocco (CAC2505 and CAC2753) were obtained and included in the analysis. Using the genotyping nomenclature previously described for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV (23, 24) as a reference point, the sequences of DcCoV-HKU23 examined in this study were mapped into the 3 main subclusters of BCoV, namely, C1, C2, and C3, where C1 contains BCoVs from the Americas, C2 contains BCoVs from Europe, and C3 contains the prototype BCoV (Fig. 3). In the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene, all the African and Saudi DcCoV-HKU23 sequences clustered within clade C2, which includes BCoVs from Europe. African DcCoV-HKU23 sequences did not form a monophyletic clade with the Saudi Arabia strain; instead, these sequences were scattered within clade C2, suggesting multiple ancestral origins of DcCoV-HKU23 across different geographic areas.",

In BCoV, this region contains 2 ORFs (ORF4a and ORF4b) that encode 4.9-kDa and 4.8-kDa nonstructural proteins, respectively. The absence of ORF4a and ORF4b in HCoV-OC43 suggested that they are not essential for viral replication (25). Pairwise comparisons of this region among all DcCoV-HKU23 strains with BCoV-DB2, RbCoV HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 revealed nonsense mutations in both ORF4a and ORF4b in DcCoV-HKU23 strains from Saudi Arabia and Africa that have resulted in premature stop codons and a truncated protein. A 200-nt deletion was observed in NV1385 after the premature stop codon of ORF4a. Similar though not identical patterns of deletion were also found in RbCoV-HKU14 and HCoV-OC43 that resulted in more-truncated protein sequences. Although these protein sequences differ, the nucleotide sequences of DcCoV-HKU23/362F, DcCoV-HKU23/CAC1019, RbCoV-HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 in fact share high pairwise similarity to the BCoV sequences that contain full-length sequence of both ORF4a and ORF4b. Interestingly, DcCoV/NV1097 and DcCoV/CAC2586, among other DcCoVs, contain a distinct ORF4a sequence that encodes an 8.9-kDa nonstructural protein in this region. Homology analysis of this protein was performed by BLAST searches, and the results mapped to another 8.6-kDa nonstructural protein encoded by a rodent CoV (RtMm-CoV-1/IM2014 (GenBank accession no. KY370052.1) with about 60% amino acid similarity (Fig. 4B). BCoV ORF4a and ORF4b have previously been suggested to be counterparts of the 11-kDa nonstructural protein in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (26). The discovery of this rodent-like ORF4a encoded in DcCoV-HKU23 illustrated the possibility that homologous recombination with rodent coronaviruses had occurred, highlighting its distinct evolutionary history compared to BCoV.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the BCoV signal region showed that BCoV-DB2 clustered with the group of DcCoV-HKU23 from Africa (Fig. 5B). The signal at the NS2a gene extended the region, showing the mixing of BCoV with DcCoV-HKU23 in addition to the RdRp and N genes. The tree of the RbCoV signal region showed that RbCoV-HKU14 had changed its phylogenetic position and was linked to the cluster of DcCoV-HKU23 isolates from Nigeria and Ethiopia. This clustering suggests that a recombination event had taken place between a common ancestor of DcCoV-HKU23 sequences from Nigeria or Ethiopia and RbCoV-HKU14 or a RbCoV-like virus. The presence of RodentCoV signal at the region of ORF4a and ORF4b supported the idea of a homologous recombinant resulting from recombination of West African DcCoV-HKU23 with a RodentCoV sequence in the genetic organization analysis. A tree plotted on the basis of positions 27901 to 28800 showed that the DcCoV-HKU23 strains were split into two separate evolutionary pathways (illustrated as \u201cBCoV-like\u201d and \u201cRodentCoV-like\u201d in Fig. 4A) in which West African DcCoV-HKU23 strains were clustered in an outgroup with RodentCoV-IM2014 whereas East African DcCoV-HKU23 strains were clustered with BCoV.",

In this study, HKU23 viral RNA was detected in 2.2% of dromedary nasal swabs tested in Nigeria, 0.5% in Morocco, and 1.4% in Ethiopia. The rates were higher than those seen in a previous study performed with year-around sampling of camel nasal swabs in Saudi Arabia, where a virus detection rate of 0.2% was reported (18). We detected DcCoV-HKU23 in most sampling months from October to April, which were the only periods of the year that we investigated, suggesting that there was no clear seasonality of virus activity. While cocirculation in Saudi Arabian camels of three CoVs, namely, MERS-CoV, DcCoV-229E, and DcCoV-HKU23, was reported, similar virus circulation was also observed in Nigeria, with positive rates of 2.2% for MERS-CoV (28) and 1.0% for DcCoV-229E (data not published). The serological prevalence rates of DcCoV-HKU23 antibodies in camels were 92% in Nigeria, 91% in Ethiopia, and 79% in Morocco, suggesting widespread circulation of this or an antigenically related virus over a broad geographical area across Africa in a manner comparable with the circulation of MERS-CoV (29, 30). Younger camels had lower seropositive rates than adult camels in Morocco, but no age-related differences were observed in Nigeria and Ethiopia. Differences in DcCoV-HKU23 seroprevalence rates may be attributable to variations in husbandry practices, cohabitant animal hosts, or climatic factors between these countries. Similar seroprevalence rates were observed in camels in abattoirs and farms, suggesting that virus circulation had already been established at the farm or herd level and did not solely reflect amplification in the camel marketing chain. Extensive cross-neutralization of DcCoV-HKU23 and BCoV was detected, with a trend to higher titers for DcCoV-HKU23. The high (92% to 97%) amino acid sequence identity of the spike proteins of DcCoV-HKU23 and BCoV very likely contributed the cross-neutralization seen between the two viruses.",

The distance plot generated using the ORF1ab gene can, to a modest degree, enable evaluation of the diversity within DcCoV-HKU23 sequences due to random mutations, with a lesser effect contributed by recombination. The observed diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 was comparable to that of BCoV, suggesting that the two viruses have been established in their hosts for similar periods of time. It is of interest that DcCoV-HKU23 has a much higher level of diversity than MERS-CoV. At present, there are three CoVs (camel CoV 229E, DcCoV-HKU23, and MERS-CoV) cocirculating in dromedary camels; the narrower range of genetic diversity of MERS-CoV possibly indicates a more recent introduction into camels or a purifying selection event in its more recent evolutionary history.",

With reference to the BCoV genotyping method described previously, the DcCoV-HKU23 strains obtained in this study were classified into 3 genotypes: C2/C2/C2, C2/COutlier/C2, and C2/COutlier/C3. The COutlier clade has no BCoV sequences and is a uniquely DcCoV-HKU23 clade. Two DcCoV-HKU23 samples from Morocco (CAC2505 and CAC2753) showed a C2/C2/C2 genotype, which represents a nonrecombinant variant of BCoV clade 2, suggesting a BCoV evolutionary origin and the possibility that a BCoV spillover into the Moroccan camel population had taken place. This is the first time that a nonrecombinant BCoV variant has been detected in camels. Previously, BCoV was detected in a wide range of ungulate hosts, including bovines, waterbuck, sambar deer, white-tailed deer, alpaca, giraffe, stable antelope, buffalo, and yak (31\u201334). The expansion of BCoV to camel hosts further illustrates its ability to cross species and to infect other similar ungulate hosts. Recently, surveillance of BCoV has been expanded into regions of East Asia, including China (35), South Korea (36), and Vietnam (37), and into the Caribbean (Cuba) (38). The spike genes of BCoV strains from these regions were all phylogenetically clustered into C1. The currently known geographic distribution of different genotypes of BCoV/HKU23-like viruses in camels, bovines, and other species is summarized in Fig. 6.",

The C1 and C2 genotypes of BCoV correspond to the American-Asian and European clusters, respectively. In this study, the C2 genotype of the two Morocco strains clustered with BCoVs detected in France, suggesting a divergence from the common ancestor of genotype C2 BCoVs. Other DcCoVs identified in this study, as well as those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, are recombinants, because their S gene showed an outgroup topology with respect to BCoVs and HCoV-OC43, indicating that DcCoV-HKU23 acquired its S gene through recombination with an ancestor yet to be identified. However, we cannot infer whether the recombination occurred prior to or after the introduction of the virus to camels from the present data. The phylogenies of the N genes of DcCoV-HKU23 also differed among the 8 recombinant sequences with the COutlier genotype in the S gene. A total of 7 DcCoV-HKU23 sequences (NV1010, NV1092, NV1097, NV1385, CAC1320, CAC1452, and CAC2586) were grouped into C3 in the N gene tree, indicating a close relatedness to the prototype BCoV in the N gene. DcCoV-HKU23/CAC1019 from Ethiopia and DcCoV-HKU23 from Saudi Arabia were grouped into the C2 European clade. These C2 genotype sequences suggest the possibility that an event of recombination between the N gene of a nonrecombinant BCoV strain and a recombinant DcCoV-HKU23 strain (as the backbone) had taken place. Overall, DcCoV-HKU23 exhibited broad diversity that contrasted with the genetic stability observed in BCoV. However, a limitation in the analysis was the lack of BCoV sequence data in Africa. With more BCoV genetic data sets from Africa, the recombination events of DcCoV-HKU23 and BCoV may be more clearly resolved.",

Rabbit-CoV14 is a virus initially discovered through surveillance in China (39), but similar viruses may be present in a much wider geographic region. Bootscan analysis of DcCoV-HKU23 strains from Nigeria and Ethiopia showed a recombination signal with RbCoV-HKU14-like virus at positions 22601 to 23600, harboring the NS2a and HE gene. The HE gene in clade A beta-CoVs has been suggested to have been acquired as a consequence of heterologous recombination with influenza C virus. The recombination identified here was located in a similar region, suggesting a possible recombination hot spot. The phylogeny of the signal region showed that the RbCoV sequence was linked to the DcCoV-HKU23 sequences from Ethiopia and Nigeria at a basal position, suggesting that the recombination event might have occurred with the ancestral sequence from these two regions. The HE protein encoded by clade A beta-CoVs plays a role in receptor binding through its receptor-binding or receptor-destroying activity with respect to glycan components (40). An example of the functional properties of HE has been provided in the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 to infect humans, when the HE lectin domain was progressively lost through accumulated mutations (41). The diversity of the HE genes present in parental and recombinant DcCoVs deserves further research to characterize the glycoconjugates targeted by the receptor-destroying activity and to study how such virion-glycan interactions may contribute to its host tropism.",

The deletion patterns of ORF4a and ORF4b observed in DcCoV-HKU23, RbCoV-HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 revealed stepwise deletions among these sequences. While these patterns may suggest a BCoV origin of these sequences, it is also possible that an ancestral virus that infected multiple hosts and bovines preferentially retained those ORFs. Nonsense mutations and deletions of these ORFs in DcCoV-HKU23, RbCoV-HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 supported the contention that this region may not contain essential genetic sequences and that the loss of such genetic information will not impair virus fitness in dromedaries. In fact, ORF4a and ORF4b in BCoV had previously been suggested to represent vestiges of an 11-kDa protein encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) resulting from a nonsense mutation in the middle of ORF4 (26). The region between the S and E genes may suggest a mouse or murine CoV origin of this region. As additional evidence, we also observed another 8.9-kDa protein encoded by ORF4a in DcCoV-HKU23 identified in this study which mapped to a similar protein in rodent CoV with 60% amino acid similarity. Bootscan analysis showed that DcCoV sequences from isolates collected in Morocco (CAC2586) and Nigeria (NV1010, NV1092, NV1097, and NV1385) were phylogenetically classified in an outgroup with rodent CoV at positions 27901 to 28800, suggesting a possible homologous recombination. Together, these sequences illustrated multiple origins of clade A beta-CoVs from rodent-like species. Results of recent surveillance of rodent species have identified many more novel CoV species, including ChRCoV-HKU24, Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV), Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV), and rodent CoV (42\u201344). These sequences are phylogenetically positioned at the deep branch rooting members of clade A beta-CoVs. The discovery of sequence remnants of rodent CoV in DcCoV-HKU23 further supports the involvement of rodent-like species in the evolutionary history of clade A beta-CoVs (42).",

Recombination events that led to the emergence of SARS-like CoV likely occurred in its natural reservoirs in bats, after which the virus spilled over to intermediate hosts such as civets, raccoons, dogs, and humans. Since rodents harbor the highest diversity of clade A beta-CoVs (44), one may speculate that it is possible for recombination events to occur in rodents, with the recombinant virus subsequently spilling over to other mammalian hosts if it has competitive advantages over preexisting strains.

Although the virus seems not to cause significant disease, as it was detected in apparently healthy camels in abattoirs, it is unclear whether such infections are limited to the upper respiratory mucosa, similarly to MERS-CoV, or whether they spread more systemically. Specimens from sites of the body other than the upper respiratory tract may provide information on the tropism of the virus. The lack of year-round sampling precludes making conclusions on the seasonality of virus activity. On the other hand, the strength of the study is in its range of sampling across East, West, and North Africa, which allows an understanding of the virus diversity across a large geographic region. The lack of BCoV sequences from Africa precludes a more definitive analysis of the origins of the different genotypes of HKU23.",

Among the three identified DcCoVs that circulate in dromedary camels, MERS-CoV has so far demonstrated intraspecies recombination, while DcCoV-HKU23, in addition, demonstrated interspecies recombination. Our study highlighted the importance of studying recombination of CoVs to understand the evolutionary history and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses in dromedaries.",

RT-PCR-positive amplicons were purified using ExoSap-IT reagent (USB, USA) and were subjected to Sanger sequencing to identify the identity of the CoV. Samples with DcCoV-HKU23-like virus sequences were identified and subjected to viral load quantification using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. Oligonucleotide sequences were designed to target the N genes of both DcCoV-HKU23 and bovine CoV (forward primer, 5\u2032-GTCAATACCCCGGCTGAC-3\u2032; probe, 5\u2032-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-TCGGGACCCAAGTAGCGATGAGGC-black hole quencher (BHQ)-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-AACCCTGAGGGAGTACCG-3\u2032). RT-qPCR was performed using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), with the following cycling protocol: 5 min at 50\u00b0C for reverse transcription, followed by 20 s at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95\u00b0C and 30 s at 60\u00b0C. Samples with low cycle threshold (CT) values were selected for full-genome sequencing. Reverse transcription was performed with HKU23-specific primers targeting different regions of the genome to generate cDNAs, which were subsequently amplified by PCR with primers designed to generate overlapping amplicons that can cover the whole genome. The primer sequences are available upon request. PCR amplicons from each sample were pooled for next-generation sequencing and processed with a Nextera XT library preparation kit following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq instrument with read lengths of paired ends of approximately 300 bp. The raw sequence reads generated were mapped to a reference DcCoV-HKU23 genome (GenBank accession no. KF906250.1) using Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) (45). The sequence of the target virus was generated by taking the majority consensus of the mapped reads with sequencing coverage at each position more than 100 times.",
