The sheer volume of cases coupled with infrastructural and societal constraints traditionally has hindered MRSA control efforts here. Few beds are available for contact isolation despite 42 negative pressure isolation rooms being built after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. There is insufficient capacity to isolate all MRSA patients, as they constitute up to 15% of all inpatients, and prioritizing MRSA would impair the ability to isolate or cohort patients with other transmissible diseases.15 Adding to the problem is the average daily bed occupancy rate exceeding 85% \u2013 the result of a recent, rapid population boom in Singapore.",

This consisted of swabs of nares, axillae and groin (plus any wounds) cultured on chromogenic agar MRSA Select (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France).16 Patients not known to have MRSA had entry swabs, while those who had been in a hospital ward >48 h, had no prior positive MRSA cultures (screening or clinical) and had not died, also had exit swabs upon discharge or transfer from the ward.\u2212Promotion of hand hygiene. This was done primarily via educational and socio-behavioural measures. Hand hygiene education focused on the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2018five moments for hand hygiene\u2019, which was audited. Continuous reminders were developed, including via posters in wards, computer screensavers, and audio on ward entry. Hospital-wide training programmes ran in 2009 and annually to coincide with the WHO World Hand Hygiene Day. All frontline clinical staff had to participate in a compulsory 20 min training programme and assessment over one week on both years. A sticker placed on the staff identification tag confirmed certification. All new staff received the same programme at orientation. To further reinforce the message, the clinical examination template in the National University of Singapore final MBBS degree stipulated a deduction in marks for failed hand hygiene.17\n\u2212Auditing of hand hygiene compliance. This was performed primarily by appointed ward liaison nurses that had been trained by infection control nurses, supplemented and cross-checked by medical and nursing students who were engaged via innovative educational programmes in which they were trained as auditors and observed staff in their work covertly.18\n\u2212Isolation or cohorting of MRSA-positive patients. Such patients were placed in isolation or, more usually, in a designated cohort cubicle, established on each ward. Periodic snapshots of cohorting compliance were undertaken. A close relationship between the bed management unit and the project stakeholders was developed to facilitate the siting of MRSA-positive patients.\u2212Public and regular feedback of results. Data on hand hygiene compliance and MRSA acquisition were posted on ward-based \u2018dashboards\u2019 that had been requested by hospital administration. The signage was publicly displayed, ward-specific and updated monthly.\u2212Other measures included a bare-below-the-elbows policy for all clinical staff, coloured bracelets to identify all colonized and infected patients, and cash rewards (of around US$250) for exemplary performances by wards or departments with regards to hand hygiene compliance and MRSA transmission rates to enjoy a celebratory lunch or similar.\u2212To ensure that any progress made was primarily due to the MRSA bundle and not changes in prescribing habits, surveillance of major classes of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, third or fourth generation cephalosporins and vancomycin) was undertaken from 2006 using pharmacy-based electronic data. This was expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inpatient-days.\n",

Subsequent analysis accounted for autocorrelation by modelling changes in the mean incidence or proportion as a function of time. The numbers of MRSA clinical cases and MRSA bacteraemia cases per quarter were modelled as Poisson with mean \u03bc(t) per hospital inpatient-day. Extending the model to negative binomial to account for super-Poisson heterogeneity did not improve the fit. The quarterly number of positive exit swabs among initially non-colonized patients was assumed to be binomial with proportion p(t). Both models used linear (on a log or logit scale) changes in location with time, with a single change in gradient allowed.

Because the likelihood surface suggested that the maximum likelihood estimate of \u03c4, in particular, may not be normally distributed, Bayesian methods were used to derive 95% confidence intervals (CIs), taking uniform prior distributions over the parameter support, using Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers with 100,000 samples and every 10th retained, with multivariate normal proposals with covariance tuned on trial runs. Approximate P-values were obtained by extending credible intervals by analogy to the relationship between P-values and the end-points of confidence intervals.

Decolonization (of patients or staff) remains controversial beyond some preoperative indications and further work in this regard is underway at our institution.
