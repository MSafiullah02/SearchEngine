In late 2019, a new highly contagious virus appeared in China and spread around the world with a high mortality rate. Figure 1 ). While only basic essentials can be purchased during containment, the National Rifle Association (NRA) considered firearms as essential products. Death by firearms is directly linked with firearm access (i.e. the availability of firearms to individuals) and the level of firearm ownership, both at the population, household and individual levels. 4 Owning a gun increases the risk of death by domestic violence for women by 20-fold 2,5 and the risk of suicide by 3-fold. 6 Contrary to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, the current increased trend for gun ownership will not only have short-term consequences, as the risk of death increases the moment the gun is purchased, but will also have long-term consequences and subsequent increases in gun violence.",

We also want to acknowledge that, despite no available data for most countries in the world, the purchase of guns worldwide might be a related consequence of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, which may increase the already-staggering number of 857 million civilian firearms in the world. Moreover, victims of gun violence would utilise intensive care unit resources, which are already under great pressure with a shortage of assisted ventilation and are vital in the context of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.

At the time of writing, nearly 4 billion people (i.e. more than half the global population) are confined to their homes and will remain here for several weeks or months, without participation in outdoor occupational or leisure activities. Fear of dying is evident among the population. In addition to a shortage of respiratory masks and essential drugs, the unprecedented financial service market crash and knowledge of Wall Street financial dynamics adds to the perceptions of insecurity. Stress and anxiety have resulted in the irrational necessity for self-defense and the purchase of guns.
