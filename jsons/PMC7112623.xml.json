In view of the prominent role of the mucosa in pathogenic agents transmission and infection, direct mucosal vaccination could be an effective strategy for prophylaxis by induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses.",

Two well-characterized bacterial proteins with an outstanding potential to function as mucosal adjuvant are the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of Escherichia coli and the cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholerae. Their non-toxic mucosal binding B subunits (LTB/CTB) have already been tested for their immunogenicity and their ability to act as mucosal adjuvant [13]. LTB has been found to be a more potent adjuvant than CTB [14]. Therefore, VP2 has been expressed as a fusion protein with E. coli heat-liable toxin B subunit (LTB) in the L. casei. LTB is a gut adhesion molecule and helpful to antigen uptake from and binding to gut [15]. It was reported that the expression of heterologous antigen fused with LTB in attenuated Salmonella has been described an optimized strategy for the induction of mucosal and systemic antibodies responses [16]. LTB is responsible for heterologous protein exposure to mucosal immune system via binding to GM1 ganglioside anchored on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells so that it can function also as mucosal adjuvant producing higher titer serum and secretory antibodies in mice orally administered with L. casei-expressing VP2-LTB.",

The inducible expression systems in this study base on xylose operon regulation. The target protein expression was completely depended on the xylose induction. According to the above statement, the induced recombinant strains were able to stimulate the mucosal immune system of gastrointestinal tract for several days but not a lifetime after oral administration in mice, which did not result in immunotolerance against target antigen. When the induced recombinant bacteria colonized on the mucosal surface, although the xylose was not present, VP2-LTB protein has been still keeping secretory or trans-membrane state in host cell and was recognized, processed and present by relevant lymphocytes in the mucosal immune system, which could induce local immune responses. Theoretically, secretory antigen was more easily uptaken by lymphocytes than membrane-anchored antigen.",

The administration process consisted of three sets of three successive daily doses of the recombinant L. casei, which was required in order to ensure that antibody response to PPV could be induced in all mice orally administered by live bacteria. Oral vaccination is based on antigen delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, the largest mucosal surface and the central site of IgA secretion. Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) plays the most important role in the mucosal immune response against pathogen invasion, which mainly existed in local mucosa fluids. The results of immunization showed that the recombinant strains were capable of inducing systemic immune response producing IgG and mucosal immune response producing sIgA.",

By contrast, the recombinant L. casei-expressing PPV-VP2-LTB fusion protein were able to induce higher antibody level of local mucosal or systemic immune response than that induced by the recombinant L. casei-expressing PPV-VP2, in addition, rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB was greater than rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB in induction of antibody immune responses, which were conspicuous events in this study. Statistically significant differences were observed since the seventh day post the first immunization. Owing to the above characteristics, we hypothesized that LTB played the crucial role in the induction of higher antibody level as a mucosa-targeting molecule, as well as LTB of the fusion protein on the surface of rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB was partly covered by cell wall so that it was partly accessible to ligands on the enterocytes resulting in lower level of immune antibodies than that induced by rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB.",
