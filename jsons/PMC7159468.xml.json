This close relationship is supported by several morphological and anatomical characters, including the shared occurrence of bisporangiate, monothecal anthers (e.g., Hamann, 1962, 1975; Linder and Rudall, 1993).",

In Centrolepidaceae, leaf blades are typically longer than the sheath. In contrast, leaves in Restionaceae are typically reduced and leaf blades, when present, are short. However, the occurrence of well\u2010developed leaf blades in Restionaceae seedlings is consistent with the hypothesis that Centrolepidaceae evolved from Restionaceae via neoteny (Linder and Caddick, 2001). With very few exceptions (Linder et al., 1998; Briggs et al., 2014), Restionaceae are dioecious, bearing unisexual or functionally unisexual flowers. In contrast, dioecy is not recorded in Centrolepidaceae and reproductive units are more commonly bisexual.",

            "text": "Whereas flower identity is clear and uncontroversial in Restionaceae, morphological interpretation of the basic reproductive units is contentious in Centrolepidaceae (reviewed by Sokoloff et al., 2009a). These units are interpreted either as flowers (euanthia) or as compact groups of reduced and often fused, unisexual, perianthless flowers (pseudanthia or synanthia). Proponents of the pseudanthial concept have viewed the unusual pattern of carpel arrangement in multicarpellate species of Centrolepis (in two rows along a stalk\u2010like structure, see Fig. 1D, E) as the principal supporting evidence (e.g., Eichler, 1875; Hamann, 1962). However, a recent study of gynoecia in all genera of Centrolepidaceae (Sokoloff et al., 2009a) found that the pattern of carpel arrangement does not contradict interpretation of the carpels as belonging to the same flower (see also Hieronymus, 1873). In flowers of Centrolepidaceae, carpels always form a single whorl, as in most other monocots (Remizowa et al., 2010), but the whorl becomes strongly asymmetric in Centrolepis due to one\u2010sided elongation of the receptacle (Sokoloff et al., 2009a). Another possible interpretation is that the floral center is formed by united ventral parts of carpels rather than by the receptacle, but this alternative interpretation does not affect any aspects considered here. If all the carpels of a reproductive unit are viewed as belonging to a single flower, there is no argument against interpreting the bisexual reproductive units of Centrolepidaceae as bisexual flowers. This interpretation is followed in the present paper. Multiplication of carpels within the single whorl and their placement at different levels due to one\u2010sided growth coupled with the occurrence of only one monothecal stamen (Fig. 1D, E) make flowers of some Centrolepis one of most unusual and peculiar among angiosperm flowers.",

            "text": "Inflorescences of Centrolepidaceae are diverse and controversially interpreted by various authors. Most species of Centrolepis possess two large bracts on the primary inflorescence axis, each subtending a lateral group of flowers arranged in a zig\u2010zag pattern. The morphological nature of these lateral structures was problematic due to the apparent absence of flower\u2010subtending bracts. Hieronymus (1873) viewed the zig\u2010zag pattern as evidence supporting the arrangement of the flowers into a cincinnus (a kind of monochasium). Following this interpretation, the entire inflorescence could be described as a thyrse (see Endress, 2010). In contrast, Bentham (1877, 1878) interpreted the lateral units in inflorescences of Centrolepis as dorsiventral distichous spikelets, so that the entire inflorescence should be viewed as a double spike. This interpretation implies that spikelet dorsiventrality in Centrolepis involves oblique insertion of flowers. Dorsiventral spikelets with pronounced oblique insertion of flowers are superficially remarkably different from nondorsiventral ones (Fig. 2A\u2013F). On the other hand, in angiosperms that lack flower\u2010subtending bracts entirely, dorsiventral distichous spikelets and cincinni can appear superficially very similar (Fig. 2G\u2013J). However, considerable fundamental differences exist between these two patterns of flower arrangement, allowing for divergent evolutionary and taxonomic interpretations (Fig. 2G\u2013J).",

Roem. & Schult., which possesses inflorescences typical of Centrolepis, revealed sporadic reduced phyllomes in positions of flower\u2010subtending bracts predicted by the dorsiventral spikelet hypothesis (Sokoloff et al., 2010). Sokoloff et al. (2009b) described a new species, Centrolepis racemosa D.D. Sokoloff & Remizowa from northern Australia, with highly unusual inflorescences represented by a simple, nondorsiventral spike with flowers located in the axils of well\u2010developed foliage leaves. Comparison of patterns of orientation of monosymmetric flowers in C. racemosa and C. exserta further supports Bentham's (1877, 1878) interpretation of inflorescences in Centrolepis as fundamentally racemose, with lateral units being dorsiventral spikelets (Sokoloff et al., 2010).

As highlighted by Cooke (1995), the rachis can be interpreted either as a single axis or as a sympodial system. However, this question remains unresolved, and we disagree with Cooke (1995) that it is one of terminology rather than substance. Inflorescences of the aberrant species C. racemosa share some important characters with those of the two other genera of the family, namely, the presence of well\u2010developed flower\u2010subtending bracts (shared with Gaimardia) and the occurrence of numerous bracts on the primary inflorescence axis (shared with Aphelia, if its axis is a monopodium). Sokoloff et al. (2010) suggested that the unusual inflorescences of C. racemosa are more likely derived rather than primitive, but this hypothesis has not been tested in any phylogenetic analysis.",

According to Bentham (1877: p. 505), the scales \u201cmay possibly represent a reduced perianth, but are perhaps more likely to be bracts or bracteoles\u201d. Interpretation of flowers in Centrolepidaceae as perianthless but bracteolate contrasts with the presence of a perianth and absence of bracteoles in the closely related Restionaceae; this apparent contradiction has not been addressed specifically in the literature.

However, due to the small overall size of inflorescences with densely crowded flowers and the tiny size of some of these phyllomes, it is difficult to analyze them using herbarium material and a dissecting microscope (i.e., the common taxonomic approach). As a result, current knowledge of phyllomes associated with flowers of Centrolepidaceae is inadequate. For example, Cooke (1995) in his detailed revision of Australian Centrolepis did not describe the spatial arrangement of the phyllomes; a feature regarded as taxonomically important by Hou (1957), although the latter considered only the three Malesian species. In this present paper, using SEM investigations, we document the occurrence in some species of additional phyllomes that are not mentioned in the taxonomic literature.",

Roem. & Schult. Our data confirm the occurrence of plants with basically distichous (to spirodistichous) phyllotaxis obscured by extensive branching (e.g., in C. milleri). However, in many species with densely crowded leaves (e.g., Centrolepis fascicularis, C. strigosa, C. racemosa, Gaimardia australis Gaudich., and Aphelia nutans Hook.f. ex Benth.), we found true spiral phyllotaxis. When vegetative leaves are distichous, the pattern of phyllotaxis does not change on transition to an inflorescence. In species with spiral phyllotaxis, except C. racemosa, the pattern changes to distichy on transition to an inflorescence. In C. racemosa, the Fibonacci spiral continues directly to the inflorescence.",

In G. setacea and G. fitzgeraldii (Fig. 3A), the prophyll is followed by foliage leaves. The first foliage leaf is abaxial and the plane of distichy of lateral shoots is almost the same as that of the main shoot. In G. australis, the leaf following the prophyll is also abaxial, but has a reduced lamina; other leaves have normal laminas and follow a spiral pattern. In Aphelia (Fig. 3D) and Centrolepis (Fig. 3H), lateral shoots lack an adaxial prophyll, and the leaf series starts with two leaves in transversal or obliquely transversal positions (these can be interpreted as prophylls analogous to those of most eudicots). If the shoots are distichous, the plane of distichy of a lateral shoot is perpendicular to that of the main shoot. In Centrolepis, the first leaves of the lateral shoots are normally foliage leaves (Fig. 3H). An exception was found in plants of C. polygyna (R.Br.) Hieron., which bear branches of several orders. Branches of higher orders did not form foliage leaves at all and the two first phyllomes were bladeless cataphylls. In Aphelia, one (Fig. 3D) or two first leaves of lateral shoots are membranous bladeless cataphylls. These can be followed by foliage leaves (or a single foliage leaf; rarely all leaves are foliage leaves). However, one or two cataphylls may be the only leaves produced by a lateral shoot before its transition to an inflorescence. In small plants of Aphelia, the only vegetative foliage leaves are on the main shoot, but in vigorous plants, there also are foliage leaves on at least some lateral shoots. Both patterns are recorded in the same species (A. cyperoides R.Br.). We did not record shoot branching in the axil of the prophyll of Gaimardia, but branching often takes place in the axils of the first leaf (as well as subsequent leaves) in Aphelia and Centrolepis (e.g., in Fig. 3H there is branching in the axil of the first leaf of a second order shoot, labeled 1).",

In Aphelia and Centrolepis, the vegetative foliage leaves have an open sheath with membranous margins (Fig. 3F, J, N) and a filiform lamina with single vascular bundle. According to Cooke (1995, 1998), a ligule is absent from both Aphelia and Centrolepis, though a minute ligule is reportedly present in C. monogyna (Hook.f.) Benth. (Cooke, 1992). In our taxon sampling, a ligule was present in Aphelia (Fig. 3D, F) and absent in Centrolepis (Fig. 3J, N). Ligule length increases sequentially in leaves along the main shoot in Aphelia. The leaf blade is likely unifacial in Aphelia and Gaimardia, though developmental data are needed to test this hypothesis. In Centrolepis aristata (R.Br.) Roem. & Schult., the membranous margins of the sheathing base are continuous with longitudinal ribs in the proximal part of the lamina and there is no ligule (Fig. 3N). These ribs can be interpreted as borders of adaxial and abaxial surfaces and thus, blades of the vegetative leaves of Centrolepis are bifacial. However, the ribs are not clearly recognizable in many species of the genus (e.g., Fig. 3J), but again, there is no ligule.",

They have only open membranous sheathing bases, unvascularized in all species studied here (with a single bundle in some specimens of C. humillima Benth.: Cooke, 1992). These leaves were termed cataphylls by Cooke (1980, 1992, 1995). Normally, the term cataphyll is used for reduced bladeless leaves located at the beginning of a leaf series on a shoot, preceding foliage leaves and commonly functioning as a protective organ of a bud (Weberling and M\u00fcller\u2010Doblies, 1989). At first glance, this is not the case in Centrolepis. However, as the phyllomes on the main inflorescence axis often possess laminas, one could speculate that the reduced leaves below the inflorescence start a new quantum of growth of the same axis that first produced the vegetative foliage leaves (another elementary shoot, see Gatsuk, 1974; Mikhalevskaya, 2008). For this reason, we retain the term cataphyll for Centrolepis in the same sense as introduced by Cooke, but highlight a need for developmental studies to test the hypothesis regarding the occurrence of two elementary shoots.",

In our opinion, the zig\u2010zag curvature does not indicate that the inflorescence axis is sympodial, as proposed earlier by Cooke (1995) with respect to Aphelia. Its monopodial nature is supported by two arguments. (1) Phyllomes of the primary inflorescence axis bear axillary structures (usually spikelets, see below), easily interpretable in the monopodial model. If a sympodial model is followed, these spikelets could be viewed as terminal, but in this case, the continuation of the primary inflorescence axis appears to be a lateral branch without a subtending phyllome, which is a relatively complex interpretation. (2) The zig\u2010zag curvature appears late in inflorescence development. The young inflorescence axis is straight (Fig. 6G).",

The phyllome base about one half encircles the inflorescence axis (Fig. 6C). The margins of the sheathing base are membranous and proximally extended into incurved auricles (Figs. 3G, 6A; Fig. A in Appendix S2). At the distal end of the sheathing base, the membranous margins of both sides join to form a short ligule (Figs. 3G, 6B). A row of densely inserted short and narrow typically two cellular hairs with spirally twisted tips is present along the proximal portion of the membranous margins, including auricles. A hair is attached to every marginal cell. In addition, thick hairs 2\u20134 cells long with spirally twisted tips are inserted along the abaxial surface of the sheathing base (Fig. 6A; Figs. A, B in Appendix S2). According to Cooke (1995), these thick hairs are sometimes missing from the two lowermost phyllomes in the inflorescence.",

Of these species, we here investigated A. nutans and A. brizula F. Muell. All phyllomes normally have a base that encircles approximately one half of the circumference of the inflorescence axis (Fig. D in Appendix S1; Figs. A, E, F in Appendix S2), but the width of the base of the first phyllome is variable (Figs. C, E in Appendix S1). Distal phyllomes have sheathing bases only (a very short lamina is rarely present in A. brizula); the proximal phyllomes vary in presence or absence and length of the lamina (in A. nutans, the lamina is only rarely present and always short). Ligules are present only in phyllomes with well\u2010developed laminas. In both species, the distal phyllomes differ from the two proximal ones in the presence of incurved basal auricles and conspicuous hairs along the membranous margins (at least in their basal portion, extending into the auricles). In A. brizula (Figs. D\u2013F in online Appendix S3), all phyllomes are strongly folded along their midline (the folding is not shown in the diagram in Fig. 4G), resulting in the entire inflorescence being distinctively flattened (Fig. F in Appendix S3). The distal phyllomes of A. brizula possess a row of thick (1)2(3)\u2010celled hairs in the basal portion of the keeled midrib (Fig. F in Appendix S3). The second cell is longer and thinner than the lower cell and its tip is either straight or slightly twisted. In A. nutans, all phyllomes are U\u2010shaped in cross section; proximal ones lack a keel, distal ones have an inconspicuous and glabrous keel (Fig. A in Appendix S1).",

We examined one of these two species, A. drummondii (Hieron.) Benth. The lowermost phyllome base encircles about two thirds of the inflorescence axis (Fig. F in online Appendix S4). The phyllome is broader above the base and folded and the young inflorescence is enclosed completely by its overlapping membranous margins (Fig. A in Appendix S4). In our material, the phyllome consists almost entirely of a sheathing base; the lamina is extremely short and cap\u2010like. In some other specimens, a short lamina is present (Cooke, 1995). The distal phyllomes (e.g., ppa2 in Fig. D, Appendix S4) have sheathing bases only; a lamina is either absent or very short. All phyllomes are glabrous and lack basal auricles and ligules (Figs. A, D in Appendix S4). The distal phyllomes differ from the lowermost one in that the base is equal to about one half of the circumference of the primary axis and especially by the presence of a conspicuous dorsal keel bearing multicellular emergences.",

            "text": "In most species of Centrolepis, the two phyllomes on the primary inflorescence axis at most differ quantitatively, e.g., in relative lamina to sheath length (Fig. 8A). Both phyllomes have broad bases, almost completely encircling the inflorescence axis), with membranous margins and a terete or at least basally dorsiventrally flattened lamina (Figs. 3M, 3O, 8A, 8C, 9A, 9E). The lamina is longer than the sheath (C. aristata, Fig. 8C, C. fascicularis), about as long as the sheath (C. pilosa Heiron., Fig. 9A), much shorter than the sheath (C. exserta, Fig. 8A; C. strigosa, Fig. 3M), or almost completely reduced, being only occasionally recognizable as a very short mucro [C. banksii (R.Br.) Roem. & Schult.]. The phyllomes are either glabrous (Fig. 8C), or covered with multicellular hairs (Fig. 8A), but thick or incurved hairs similar to those found in some species of Aphelia are not recorded in Centrolepis. Basal auricles are always absent. Membranous margins of the sheath are often extended above the transition to the lamina as two distal auricles. The bases of these auricles can extend onto the ventral side of the phyllome and usually come close to each other. When the two auricles unite, a bifid (C. aristata, Fig. 3O; C. fascicularis), or entire (C. drummondiana, C. pilosa) ligule is present. These observations suggest that the lamina of the phyllomes on the primary inflorescence axis is unifacial, in contrast with the bifacial lamina in vegetative foliage leaves. However, in some species with monomorphic phyllomes (C. strigosa, Fig. 3M; C. exserta), the membranous leaf margins do not extend distally onto the ventral side and the inner surface of the lamina continues directly into the adaxial surface of the sheathing base. Here, the lamina (which is very short in these species) appears to be bifacial.",

Of these, our sampling covers three species. In all three species, the base of the upper phyllome about one half surrounds the inflorescence axis, but that of the lower phyllome almost completely encircles the axis (Figs. 3K, 8D, 8E, 8H, 8I). In C. polygyna (Fig. 8D\u2013G) and C. glabra (Fig. 8H), the lower phyllome has a sheathing base with membranous margins and a long or short filiform lamina, while the upper phyllome lacks a lamina (Fig. 8D, H); both phyllomes lack any hairs or papillae. In C. polygyna (Fig. 8F, G), the membranous margins of the sheathing base extend distally into the ventral side of the lower phyllome, but their bases are not adjacent to each other, as described above. In the space between their distal ends, a transverse ridge is present (Fig. 8G). Anatomical investigation clearly shows that this ridge is the boundary between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces, whose histological patterns differ dramatically in the bifacial sheathing base. However, the lamina is unifacial, rounded in cross section, with a uniform epidermis and subepidermal chlorenchyma across the section. In C. glabra, the membranous margins do not extend distally onto the ventral side and the lamina is slightly flattened (Fig. 8H). This leaf could be bifacial, but more comparative and developmental data are required to test this hypothesis. In C. milleri (Figs. 3K, 3L, 8I), the lower phyllome lacks hairs or papillae. It has a laterally compressed sheath (Figs. 3K, 8I) that extends distally into very short auricles and a lamina that is longer than the auricles (Fig. 3L). The upper phyllome has a sheath with a smooth central region and papillate membranous margins distally prolonged into very short auricles and a lamina that is about as short as the auricles (Fig. 8I). In both phyllomes, the margins of the sheathing base extend distally only slightly onto the ventral surface, so that there is a clear gap between them (Fig. 3L), as in the lower phyllome of C. glabra. On the other hand, the lamina is rounded or almost rounded in cross section, as in the lower phyllome of C. polygyna.",

In Aphelia, the primordium is crescent\u2010shaped and has as broad a base as a mature phyllome. If a lamina is present, it differentiates due to more rapid growth of the median part of the young phyllome. Simultaneously with lamina development, the membranous margins of the sheath base differentiate. At the next stage, a ligule appears. The attenuated tip of the lamina and the basal auricles (when present) are formed late in development. The long abaxial hairs are initiated much earlier than the short marginal hairs in A. cyperoides and the distal phyllomes of A. brizula. The phyllomes of Centrolepis also initiate as broad crescent\u2010shaped primordia. The lamina results from more rapid growth of the median part of the young phyllome. The sheath margins initially do not extend distally onto the ventral surface in all examined species. Later in development, such a continuation of the sheath margins onto the ventral surface occurs in C. pilosa.",

In these taxa, each phyllome on the primary inflorescence axis directly subtends a flower (see Fig. 5D, E).

In the reduced one\u2010flowered spikelets of C. polygyna (see below), the orientation of monosymmetric flowers with respect to the phyllome of the primary inflorescence axis is almost opposite that of C. racemosa. In C. polygyna, the stamen of a unistaminate flower is closer to the subtending phyllome of the one\u2010flowered spikelet (see Fig. 8D: phyllome is labeled by an asterisk), while in C. racemosa, the stamen is closer to the primary inflorescence axis (Fig. 7D).",

In the South American species G. australis, the only flower is borne after the second phyllome of the primary inflorescence axis (Fig. 5G\u2013I). In the absence of a continuation of the primary axis, the flower can be viewed as either terminal (Fig. 4C) or located in the axil of the second phyllome (Fig. 4D). The absence of morphologically terminal flowers has been documented in Restionaceae (Kircher, 1986). On the other hand, the orientation of floral parts relative to the final phyllome in G. australis differs from the orientation of floral parts relative to the subtending phyllome in the Australasian species, which could indicate that the flower of G. australis is terminal.",

Given the sister\u2010group relationship between the two genera (Briggs et al., 2010; this study), once the spikelet interpretation is adopted for Centrolepis, it would be most parsimonious if Aphelia could be interpreted in the same way. As in Centrolepis, the plane of distichy is transverse with respect to the median plane of the subtending phyllome of the primary inflorescence axis. Thus, both left\u2010 and right\u2010handed single\u2010flowered spikelets can be recognized by the position of the first flower in a spikelet. One\u2010flowered spikelets of Aphelia also can be left\u2010 or right\u2010handed, which can be seen because the insertion of the flower is clearly transverse.

As outlined later, flowers of Aphelia are associated with two phyllomes of different morphology, which are spaced in a precise way with respect to a stamen and/or a carpel. The positions of the phyllomes allow us to see that the orientation of the first flower in two\u2010 or many\u2010flowered lateral spikelets is the same (or mirrored) as the orientation of the flower in one\u2010flowered spikelets.

In Aphelia (Fig. 10A\u2013C) and Centrolepis (Fig. 10D\u2013J), each flower is always associated with at least one phyllome, sometimes up to three. These phyllomes always lack vasculature. In the following description, we use \u201cadaxial\u201d and \u201cabaxial\u201d with respect to the corresponding sides of individual flowers as inferred from our interpretations of inflorescence morphology provided in the previous section. In distichous dorsiventral spikelets, the left and the right transversal sides of a flower are often not equal (Fig. 10A\u2013C, E\u2013I), because the flowers are asymmetric and obliquely inserted (such oblique insertion of lateral structures is recorded in many other plants with dorsiventral shoots; Goebel, 1913). Therefore, it is useful to distinguish between basiscopic and acroscopic transversal sides. The former is closer to the base of the spikelet and to the primary inflorescence axis; the latter is closer to the apex of the spikelet and to its subtending phyllome of the primary axis (Fig. 2D\u2013F).",

B, C, E in Appendix S3; Fig. C in Appendix S4), each flower is associated with two (rarely one: Fig. C in Appendix S1) phyllomes of different morphology and precisely fixed positions. Phyllome 1 is in the inferred abaxial position. It is short (0.1\u20130.2 mm), but relatively thick, triangular or elliptical in cross section. The epidermal cells are large and radially elongated with dark\u2010brown contents (Fig. D in Appendix S2). Subepidermal cells are parenchymatous and appear to be unspecialized (at least with a light microscope). Although phyllome 1 resembles a gland, no secretion was found on its surface in our fixed material, but no observations have been made in the field. Phyllome 1 was found in all examined flowers of all species examined here. It was not mentioned by Cooke (1995), but was observed by Hieronymus (1873) in A. cyperoides and female flowers of A. brizula. Phyllome 2 (the secondary bract in the terminology of Cooke, 1995) was found in all flowers of all species examined here, except in the first flower of the male spikelets of A. nutans (Fig. 10B/\n; Figs. C, E in Appendix S1). Its position is intermediate between adaxial and basiscopic transversal. Phyllome 2 is much longer than phyllome 1 in mature flowers and its base is much broader (Figs. 6C; Fig. B in Appendix S1, Figs. C\u2013E in Appendix S2, Fig. E in Appendix S3, Fig. C in Appendix S4). It is membranous and has two cell layers (the outer and inner epidermises) throughout its length (Figs. C, D in Appendix S2), sometimes with a discontinuous internal cell layer. The margins are covered by hairs or glabrous. Phyllome 2 is typically folded inward along an eccentric midline to enclose a stamen and/or a carpel in preanthetic flowers. In female flowers of A. brizula, the midline of the phyllome is keeled, with a row of thin hairs along the keel (Fig. D in Appendix S3). Phyllome 2 of Aphelia species is usually broadest just above the base and its margin closest to phyllome 1 is folded either outward (i.e., toward the primary inflorescence axis) or inward (both conditions can be found in the same species, A. cyperoides, Figs. 6C, Fig. B in Appendix S2). When the margin is folded outward (Fig. 6C), phyllome 2 superficially appears to be outermost relative to phyllome 1; when the margin is folded inward (Fig. B in Appendix S2), the phyllome 1 appears to be the outermost one. Since the bases of phyllomes 1 and 2 usually do not overlap, it is not possible to determine whether one of them is the lowermost or outermost. However, in cases where we observed real overlapping of the bases (lines of attachment), phyllome 1 was always outermost (Fig. C in Appendix S3); hence the numbering used here. Developmentally, phyllomes 1 and 2 appear in a very rapid sequence and phyllome 2 soon becomes crescent\u2010shaped (Figs. 6F, G; Figs. D, E in Appendix S1; Figs. A, B in Appendix S3; Fig. F in Appendix S4). At least in some cases, we were able to document that phyllome 1 is initiated slightly before phyllome 2 and that the primordium of the latter is relatively narrow at initiation.",

The third phyllome is always much shorter than the two membranous phyllomes and its width is variable; when it is narrow, it resembles phyllome 1 in Aphelia. Like phyllome 1 of Aphelia, the third phyllome consists of more than two cell layers, but its epidermal cells lack conspicuous brown content. It is inserted at a conspicuously lower level than the two long membranous phyllomes, so that a kind of short pedicel is present between them.

In the current study, having examined two more species and more material of C. exserta, we were unable to document young stages with only a single phyllome present. Therefore, the two or three phyllomes are initiated either simultaneously or in a very rapid sequence. Figures 9B and 9C (C. banksii) and 11A and 11B (C. curta) show spikelets where the youngest flowers already possess all phyllomes. In younger stages available, none of the phyllomes was initiated (e.g., a flower labeled F2 in Fig. 11C).",

C, D in Appendix S5) the shortest phyllome at anthesis is the abaxial/basiscopic one, which is much shorter than the shortest phyllome of C. strigosa and in most cases is not obviously membranous. In C. pilosa and C. fascicularis, the abaxial basiscopic phyllome does not exceed the level of insertion of the lowest ovary locule and the margin is slightly lobed; in C. drummondiana and C. aristata, it bears several irregular protuberances, the longest of which extends to the upper end of this locule (Fig. D in Appendix S5). The outer adaxial/acroscopic and the inner abaxial/basiscopic phyllomes are conspicuous membranous structures composed of two cell layers (the outer and inner epidermises), sometimes with traces of mesophyll at the very base of the inner phyllome. Only these two phyllomes were described by Cooke (1992) as secondary bracts. The relative lengths of the two conspicuous phyllomes depend on species and stages of development (though we lack data on actual initiation of the phyllomes). In C. aristata, the inner phyllome is much longer than the outer adaxial/acroscopic phyllome at mid stages of development, but later the size difference is inconspicuous. In C. pilosa, the inner phyllome is shorter than the outer adaxial/acroscopic one at mid stages of development (Fig. 12A, B), but this is the longest phyllome in the mature flower bud and anthetic flower (Fig. 12D). In C. drummondiana, the inner phyllome is the longest at mid stages as well as at anthesis (Fig. C in Appendix S6). It is also the longest in anthetic flowers of C. fascicularis.",

The abaxial/basiscopic phyllome is very small (0.1\u20130.2 mm wide and 0.04\u20130.08 mm long), not exceeding the level of insertion of the lowest ovarian locule (Fig. 12G, I), entire or lobed. The adaxial/acroscopic phyllome (Fig. 12H) is longer than all other floral parts in the mature floral bud, completely membranous and distally lobed or serrate. Because this phyllome has a wide base and extends onto the acroscopic (rather than basiscopic) side of a flower (Figs. 10I, 12G), we believe that it is homologous with the outer adaxial/acroscopic phyllome rather than the inner phyllome of the species described above. The two phyllomes of C. milleri are initiated simultaneously and are similar in shape and size during early developmental stages (Fig. 12E, F).",

There are no data on the anatomy of anthetic flowers in G. australis. In Centrolepis, the carpels form a single whorl, which is strongly monosymmetric in anthetic flowers. Initiation of the carpels is somewhat staggered and due to the one\u2010sided growth of the receptacle, the last\u2010formed carpels are inserted at higher levels than the first\u2010formed carpels; the result is that the carpels appear to be arranged in two rows along a stalk\u2010like extended receptacle.

The strong one\u2010sided elongation of the receptacle takes place during later developmental stages (see Fig. 12D).

Formally speaking, none of these synapomorphies is uniquely derived in the context of our analysis. However, morphologies similar to Gaimardia occur in distantly related parts of our phylogenetic tree and we believe that we have enough evidence for monophyly of the genus. The Aphelia + Centrolepis clade has five synapomorphies, all uniquely derived in Centrolepidaceae: (1) annual life cycle (with a reversal in a group of species of Centrolepis here represented by C. fascicularis); (2) two first leaves of a lateral shoot (prophylls) transversal; (3) leaf epidermal cells overlapping (see Cutler, 1969); (4) terminal spikelet absent; (5) male or bisexual flowers unistaminate. Aphelia has bootstrap support of 91% and three synapomorphies: (1) female or bisexual flowers unicarpellate; (2) fruits indehiscent; (3) phyllomes subtending spikelets dispersed with fruits (the first and the third features are uniquely derived in the family).

Pendulum symmetry is characteristic of distichous shoots of various taxa across the angiosperms (Charlton, 1997, see also Goebel, 1882, 1913; Sokoloff et al., 2007; Prenner, 2013).",

Grass rhizomes are also often dorsiventral, because axillary buds are displaced around the axis away from the midline (or the midline itself is displaced?); left\u2010hand and right\u2010hand displacement regularly alternate at nodes along a rhizome (Bell and Bryan, 2008). A potential correlation between pendulum symmetry in the vegetative shoot and the inflorescence axis would merit further exploration. Goebel (1913) observed that in some legumes and grasses, dorsiventrality characterizes the entire plant. As noted by Kellogg et al. (2013), the developmental basis for the regulation of dorsiventrality remains unknown in grasses. Pendulum symmetry is such a common feature in distichous shoots across angiosperms that we predict common patterns of developmental regulation, based on the regulation of distichy.

When shoots are distichous in Gaimardia, the plane of distichy is the same in both mother and daughter shoots. In contrast, in grasses, the plane of distichy is transversal with respect to the axil of a subtending leaf (both in vegetative parts and inflorescences, e.g., Smirnov, 1953). The arrangement of the first two leaves in the transversal positions is a synapomorphy of Aphelia+Centrolepis and when shoots are distichous, the plane of distichy of a lateral shoot is perpendicular to that of the primary shoot, as in grasses.

This interpretation is supported by the fact that the laminas are often elliptical to almost round in cross section in both families. In terete laminas, epidermal characters do not show a clear boundary between the abaxial and abaxial surfaces (Cutler, 1969). In Centrolepidaceae (Hieronymus, 1873; Cooke, 1992; Tillich, 1995, 2007; Kellogg et al., 2013; this study) and those Restionaceae that have epigeal germination (Linder and Caddick, 2001; Tillich, 2007), the terete photosynthetic part of the cotyledon (phaneromer sensu Tillich, 2007) resembles the lamina of foliage leaves. Morphologically, the phaneromer is the proximal region of the cotyledonary hyperphyll (Oberblatt). The hyperphyll of Centrolepidaceae and Restionaceae is interpreted as unifacial (Tillich, 2007), and it is tempting to adopt the same interpretation for the (broadly similar) laminas of epicotyledonary leaves.",

A ligule is absent in many Restionaceae, and its presence is not universal in Centrolepidaceae. In vegetative nonligulate leaves of Restionaceae (Briggs et al., 2014) and Centrolepis (this study), the margins of the sheathing base are continued into the lamina, though the ribs indicating the presumed boundary between the abaxial and adaxial surfaces soon disappear along the length of a lamina, at least in our material of Centrolepis.

Although Briggs et al. (2014) termed such laminae unifacial, they are, in their interpretation, fundamentally bifacial, with very narrow adaxial surface (subunifacial: see Ozerova and Timonin, 2009, for a review of terminology).

However, this criterion is equivocal in Centrolepis, because of problems in distinguishing the flower\u2010subtending bracts from tepals (see below). We believe that the sporadic occurrence of partial inflorescences with three rows of flowers (documented here for the first time for Centrolepis) further supports their interpretation as spikelets, rather than cincinni. Indeed, both tristichous and distichous partial inflorescences are accommodated readily by the spikelet model, differing merely in the phyllotaxis along the spikelet axis (1/2 and 1/3). Similarly, partial inflorescences in Leguminosae, tribe Fabeae (=Vicieae) are interpreted as dorsiventral racemes with two, three (e.g., Sinjushin, 2013), or even more (Goebel, 1913) rows of flowers.",

At first glance, the variation in number of flower rows found in Centrolepis suggests a comparison with pair\u2010flowered cincinni. Pair\u2010flowered cymes, which are probably restricted to certain members of the eudicot order Lamiales (Weber, 2013) have axes of all orders ended in a pair of flowers rather than a flower. Compact cincinni of Epithema Blume (Gesneriaceae, Weber, 1976: fig. 7) indeed superficially resemble the partial inflorescences of Centrolepis. However, they possess four, rather than three rows of flowers; four rows is precisely what should be expected theoretically in such a pattern of flower arrangement. Four rows of flowers should be also expected in a geminiflorous cincinnus. A geminiflorous cyme is a special type of cyme with one of the two dichasial branches reduced to a single flower (Weber, 2013). In theory, a pattern with three rows of flowers can be found when geminiflorous (or pair\u2010flowered) cymes are alternating regularly with normal cymes along a cincinnus, but this would be an extremely complex explanation.

The upper phyllome (that subtends the only remaining spikelet) is narrower and shorter than the lower phyllome. Clearly, the lower phyllome of species of Group 2 plays an important protective role for the spikelet. Among the species not sampled here and not studied developmentally, lower spikelets can be either present or absent in C. mutica (R.Br.) Hieron. (Barrett and Sokoloff, 2015). In some species with two spikelets (C. aristata, C. pilosa of Group 3, see Fig. 13), the upper lateral spikelet was more advanced developmentally than the lower lateral spikelet of the same inflorescence. This can be regarded as a step toward a complete loss of the lower spikelet. Thus, a tendency to suppression and loss of the lower spikelet can be seen in Centrolepis, at least in Groups 2 and 3. We did not record pronounced developmental retardation of the lower spikelet in examined members of the Group 1. Is this an argument in favor of a potentially close phylogenetic relationship between species of Groups 2 and 3 (as in Fig. 13A, B)?

Indeed, the developmental retardation of the lower spikelet could be viewed as an indication of the terminal nature of the upper spikelet. The following lines of evidence support our interpretation of the upper spikelet as lateral. (1) Continuation of the primary inflorescence axis after insertion of the upper spikelet occurs in at least one species (C. exserta). It bears a third, reduced phyllome that subtends no lateral structure. (2) Developmental retardation of the lower spikelet can be seen as an evolutionary step toward its complete reduction (see above). (3) The plane of distichy of the upper spikelet does not continue the plane of distichy of the primary inflorescence axis (Fig. 7A, B). (4) The developmental retardation of the lower spikelet is not a universal phenomenon in Centrolepis.",

These two phyllomes are readily detectable using routine taxonomic herbarium\u2010based practices. Our data show that species with two conspicuous phyllomes belong to two different groups and that members of these groups differ in position of the phyllomes (the differences are scored in characters 30 and 31 of our data matrix). In species of Group 3 (see Fig. 13A: C. aristata, C. fascicularis, C. pilosa, C. drummondiana), both long phyllomes are located on the adaxial side of the flower, but on different radii (Fig. 10H, long phyllomes are thick blue arcs). In the group of tropical annuals of Group 1 (C. banksii, C. exserta, C. curta, C. racemosa), one long membranous phyllome is adaxial, and the other is abaxial (Fig. 10D\u2013F, long phyllomes are thick blue lines). Centrolepis strigosa (a basal member of a clade comprising species of Group 1) has three long, conspicuous phyllomes (Fig. 10G) and could be considered intermediate between species of the Group 3 and tropical annuals because the two phyllomes on the adaxial side of a flower are in the same positions as in Group 3, but there is also a conspicuous phyllome on the abaxial side, as in tropical annuals. The position of C. strigosa inferred from the morphological cladistic analysis is perfectly compatible with its intermediacy between members of Group 3 and tropical annuals.",

For example, we predict cryptic flower\u2010subtending bracts in the superficially bractless flowers of C. banksii, C. exserta, and C. curta. Based on our morphological interpretations, we also predict the absence of cryptic bracts associated with flowers of C. racemosa because these flowers develop directly in the axils of the large phyllomes of the primary inflorescence axis. These predictions should be viewed as testable hypotheses because cryptic bracts can be visualized using gene expression patterns, as demonstrated in the eudicot family Brassicaceae and the monocot family Poaceae (e.g., Long and Barton, 2000; Whipple et al., 2010).",

By analogy with C. exserta, C. curta, and C. banksii, can this phyllome be interpreted as a vestigial flower\u2010subtending bract? This hypothesis can be falsified by visualization, using gene expression patterns, of cryptic flower\u2010subtending bracts distinct from the phyllome in species of Group 3. In the absence of such information, we highlight three observations from comparative morphology suggesting that the short abaxial phyllome occurring in species of Group 3 does not represent a flower\u2010subtending bract. (1) In contrast with C. exserta, C. curta, and C. banksii, this phyllome is not inserted at a conspicuously lower level than two other (long) phyllomes. (2) In contrast with C. exserta, C. curta, and C. banksii, this phyllome has only two cell layers (like the long membranous phyllomes of all species of the genus). (3) This phyllome has the same location and shape (broad base extending into the basiscopic side) as one of the large and conspicuous phyllomes of species of C. strigosa. Plotted onto diagrams, the phyllomes of members of Group 3 (Fig. 10H) and C. strigosa (Fig. 10G) are so similar that they are most likely homologous. Furthermore, the drastic size difference between the abaxial/basiscopic phyllomes of species of Group 3 and C. strigosa appears late in development; the phyllomes are very similar at mid stages. On the other hand, the large abaxial (or abaxial/basiscopic) phyllomes of tropical annuals and C. strigosa are positionally and structurally similar. Thus, the large abaxial/basiscopic phyllome of C. strigosa is homologous with a similar large phyllome of tropical annuals and not with the presumed flower\u2010subtending bracts of C. exserta, C. curta, and C. banksii.",

At first sight, these phyllomes appear comparable with those of Centrolepis milleri. However, in terms of phylogeny, C. milleri is not closely related to Aphelia. Also, the long membranous phyllome of Aphelia is adaxial/basiscopic rather than merely adaxial, while the long membranous phyllome of C. milleri is adaxial/acroscopic. Therefore, the two long phyllomes are unlikely to be homologous.

We speculate that these phyllomes can be interpreted as tepals rather than floral prophylls (bracteoles) because floral prophylls are not recorded in the closely related family Restionaceae (Kircher, 1986). In species of Centrolepis with three tepals (Group 3 and C. strigosa), the adaxial/basiscopic tepal occupies in an inner position with respect to the other two, so we interpret it as an inner\u2010whorl tepal, strongly associated (or even basally fused) with the stamen. Strong association between stamens and tepals occurs in a broad range of monocots (reviewed by Endress, 1995; Remizowa et al., 2010), indeed, it is more common between inner\u2010whorl stamens and tepals (petals) than between outer\u2010whorl stamens and tepals (sepals). In Restionaceae, the family most closely related to Centrolepidaceae, only inner\u2010whorl stamens are present, either as fertile stamens or as staminodes in functionally male flowers (Ronse De Craene et al., 2001, 2002); these inner\u2010whorl stamens are basally connected with the inner\u2010whorl tepals (H.

Although its phylogenetic position in the tropical group (predicted by Sokoloff et al., 2009b) is supported by the current study, C. racemosa differs from other tropical species and in fact from all other species of Centrolepis in an impressive list of characters (online Appendix S7). Our phylogenetic analysis provided two alternative hypotheses for a potential sister\u2010group relationship of C. racemosa (both within the group of tropical annuals), one with C. curta (Fig. 13C) and the other in an unresolved position among other tropical annuals (Fig. 13B). These two topologies imply that the branch leading to C. racemosa is eight or nine steps long, respectively. In all shortest trees found, the branch leading to C. racemosa is the longest branch within Centrolepidaceae.

Shoot apical meristems of phylogenetically related species of Centrolepis produce three distinct types of phyllomes in a precise sequence, i.e., the foliage leaves, the cataphylls and the phyllomes of the primary inflorescence axis (Appendix S7). In C. racemosa, all the phyllomes produced by the shoot apical meristem are basically similar to each other. In other species of Centrolepis, the leaf lamina is formed by the hyperphyll (Oberblatt), at least in phyllomes of the primary inflorescence axis. In C. racemosa, the leaves are apparently formed by the hypophyll only (its leaves lack clear demarcation between hypophyll and hyperphyll). In Centrolepis species other than C. racemosa, the inflorescence is clearly demarcated from the vegetative part of a shoot. The last internode before the inflorescence (the final internode) is the only long internode in many species (though not in C. curta). In many species, phyllotaxy changes at the transition to the inflorescence, but in C. racemosa, the boundary of the inflorescence is not sharp (an empty phyllome is sometimes inserted between the two flower\u2010subtending phyllomes), the basal internode is not differentiated, and there is no phyllotactic change at the transition to the inflorescence.

On the other hand, Centrolepidaceae are the closest grass relatives that show an independent event of bract suppression, so it will be interesting to investigate whether the genes involved in bract suppression are more similar between grasses and centrolepids than between grasses and Arabidopsis.",

            "text": "Phenotypes of tassel sheath (tsh) mutants of maize with resuppressed bracts show several parallels with C. racemosa. These mutants showed some defects in branching, so that spikelet pairs were often initiated instead of long branches in male inflorescences and single spikelets sometimes developed instead of spikelet pairs. These features can be interpreted as a shift toward a loss of differentiation into several hierarchical types of shoots, just as in C. racemosa (Chuck et al., 2010; Whipple et al., 2010). Resuppression of bracts in maize can alter patterns of phyllotaxis (Chuck et al., 2010). However, an important issue is that suppressed bracts in grasses subtend inflorescence branches, whereas the suppressed bracts of Brassicaceae and Centrolepis subtend individual flowers. Flower\u2010subtending bracts are not suppressed in grasses.",
