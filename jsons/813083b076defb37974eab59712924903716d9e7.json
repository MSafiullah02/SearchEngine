The crisis also poses several important questions for clinicians on how best to deliver care within the new restrictions. Therefore, the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG) has developed guidance on the assessment and management of ADHD during the COVID-19 virus pandemic (see full guidance in the appendix).",

Schools and teachers should try to monitor all their students but should include those with ADHD, especially adolescents, as a priority group, because of their disorganisation and increased level of risk.

The efficacy of some of these systems are supported by trial evidence. 4-6 Some online systems have also been shown to have value. 7 However, parents must be cautious and avoid paying for untested applications that could do more harm than good. The EAGG guidelines highlights six essential messages (appendix p 14), including building the child's self-confidence and making sure all family members know what is expected of them. In relation to other non-pharmacological strategies, individuals using neurofeedback or cognitive training should be encouraged to continue practising transfer exercises during homework and new challenges.",

The inability to do routine, face-to-face clinical visits to initiate and monitor medication should not be viewed as an absolute contraindication to pharmacotherapy. Instead, the risks and benefits of initiating or maintaining medication under the COVID-19 restrictions implemented in some countries should be carefully considered. If the use of medication is deemed desirable, strategies for remote monitoring should be implemented. ",
