Both locations, one location in the city of Compton (home A), and the other location in Inglewood (home B), contained chicken flocks (<20 birds) that had been identified by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) as having one or more ENDV-infected birds within the preceding 5 d. Flies were collected before poultry were euthanized and removed from the private homes by the END Task Force (a joint United States Department of Agriculture and CDFA organization) responsible for efforts to eradicate END in California. Fly collectors followed all biosecurity precautions recommended by the CDFA while sampling at these homes. Multiple 5-min sweep collections were made at each home, taking care not to touch poultry cages or the ground with the net while sweeping. Sweep net collections continued at each home until flies were no longer readily captured. Captured insects were killed on dry ice, placed into labeled vials by using sterilized forceps, and held on dry ice until they could be returned to the laboratory to be identified and counted. Sweep nets and forceps were sterilized between each 5-min collection by submergence in 10% Lysol (Reckitt Benckiser Inc., Wayne, NJ) after which nets were allowed to dry before reuse.",

Fly pools were stored at -80\u00b0C until shipment on dry ice to the USDA Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL), in Athens, GA, where they were again placed at -80\u00b0C until tested for the presence of ENDV. Pools were homogenized in 1.5 ml of brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth with antibiotics (200 \u03bcg of gentamicin/ml, 2000 U of penicillin/ml, and 4 \u03bcg of amphotericin B/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by using a tissue grinder with sterile plastic pestles in microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Virus isolation was performed by inoculating 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant into the allantois of each of three 9- or 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Eggs were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a standard humidified incubator. The embryonated chicken eggs were obtained from the SEPRL specific-pathogen-free White Leghorn flock. Eggs were candled to determine embryo death each 24 h through 7 d postinoculation. Embryos that died within the first 24 h were discarded. Embryos that died between 24 h and 7 d as well as all survivors at 7 d were chilled at 4\u00b0C. Amnio-allantoic fluid (AAF) harvested from chilled eggs was tested for hemagglutination (HA) activity to detect ENDV. Virus presence in HA-positive samples was confirmed by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) with Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV)-specific antiserum (King 1996a). Amnio-allantoic fluids from HA negative dead embryos and embryos alive at 7 d postinoculation were subjected to a second serial passage by inoculation of 100 \u03bcl of the AAF into each of three additional embryonated chicken eggs. Eggs were candled, and killed embryos were handled as before. If by day 7 postinoculation there was no HA activity in the AAF of the second passage dead or surviving embryos, the specimen was regarded as negative for ENDV.",

The fluid was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 7 min. RNA was separated into the aqueous phase with the addition of 200 \u03bcl of chloroform, followed by precipitation with isopropanol. After one wash with 70% ethanol, RNA was dried and resuspended in RNase-free water. The 5\u2032 end of the ENDV fusion gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced using primers targeting a 635-bp fragment that included the fusion protein cleavage site (forward primer, 5\u2032-GAG GTT ACC TCY ACY AAG CTR GAG A-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-TCA TTA ACA AAY TGC TGC ATC TTC CCW AC-3\u2032). These primers amplify the NDV genomic region between positions 4317 and 5084. Standard 50 \u03bcl reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reactions were carried out using a kit (SuperScript III One Step RT-PCR, Invitrogen) with annealing temperature at 56\u00b0C. PCR-amplified samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the bands were excised and eluted using the QuickClean 5M gel extraction kit (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Once the PCR products were cleaned, samples were quantified using a standard spectrophotomer and sequenced. All double-stranded nucleotide-sequencing reactions were performed with fluorescent dideoxynucleotide terminators in an automated sequencer (ABI 3700 automated sequencer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nucleotide sequence editing and analysis were conducted with the LaserGene sequence analysis software package (LaserGene, version 5.07, DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI). The virus was sequenced and compared by Blast analysis (Altschul et al. 1990) to an END viral sequence [chicken/U.S.(AZ)/236498/03] obtained from commercial poultry infected with ENDV during the 2002 outbreak. It also was compared with other available GenBank ENDV sequences. Genomic sequences from viruses recovered from flies at each collection site were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. EF424375 and EF424376).",

            "text": "Although all fly species were collected in small numbers, ENDV was isolated from the three most abundant species collected during this study. This is the first report of ENDV isolated from field-collected P. cuprina and M. domestica; ENDV had previously been isolated from F. canicularis and Fannia femoralis (Stein) from a commercial poultry operation during the 1971 END outbreak (Rogoff et al. 1975). Given the small numbers of flies collected, the prevalence of ENDV-infected flies was high with \u224830% of the pools containing the three species mentioned above having one or more flies per pool infected with virus. The virus prevalence in Fannia spp. collected from commercial poultry operations during the 1971 END outbreak was far lower with only two of 78 pools of Fannia spp. (3,926 total flies) collected before or within 2 d of poultry removal containing ENDV, and no virus was recovered from other common fly species (Rogoff et al. 1975). It is unclear to what extent Rogoff et al. (1975) may have collected flies from poultry facilities where poultry or even manure had already been removed from the site, perhaps resulting in the much lower ENDV infection prevalence in flies relative to this study. The higher ENDV prevalence in this study also may be due to differences between commercial poultry and backyard poultry in animal housing, manure handling, or vaccination status of the poultry against Newcastle disease virus. Backyard poultry are often housed together on the ground or in wooden boxes, giving them greater access to an infected bird and its manure relative to commercial egg-layer poultry that are separated into cages suspended above the ground where the manure is allowed to accumulate. Additionally, backyard poultry are usually not vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus and infected birds would be expected to shed a greater concentration of ENDV in their manure relative to vaccinated commercial poultry (Kapczynski and King 2005).",

Wet manure provides an excellent developmental environment for several fly species as well as a substrate on which adult flies feed. Manure also provides an excellent media for maintaining and transmitting infectious agents to flies as the viscosity of the manure enhances manure attachment to fly tarsi and cuticular bristles (Tan et al. 1997). In addition, flies feeding on bacteria in the manure would be expected to consume some amount of the infectious agent. Further studies are needed to determine whether ENDV is associated with these fly species simply as an external contaminant or if the virus is protected or even amplified within the gut or other tissues of the fly.",

(1985) demonstrated the potential for house flies to transmit pathogens by placing flies into cages with Campylobacter jejuni-infected chickens and subsequently moving the flies to cages with pathogen-free chickens, resulting in C. jejuni infection in the previously uninfected chickens. Similarly, turkey poults housed in isolation units became infected with turkey corona virus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, TCV) when house flies orally inoculated with TCV were released into the isolation units for 24 h (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003), and cattle held in confined pens became infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7 after house flies orally inoculated with the bacteria were released into the pens for 48 h (Ahmad et al. 2007). However, the actual mechanism of bacterial transmission from the flies to the chickens or cattle in the studies mentioned above remains unknown.",

It is possible that chickens and other birds can consume virus with recently infected flies or contaminated fly feces and regurgitated matter (Sawabe et al. 2006).

Greenberg (1973) reported that house flies were capable of flights ranging from 2.3 to 11.8 km within 24 h. Although fly involvement in virus movement between commercial poultry facilities is probably minor relative to other means of virus movement (e.g., on personnel, shared equipment, or manure hauling vehicles), fly involvement in virus movement among poultry houses at a single commercial facility or among backyard poultry may be significant given the short distances flies would need to move between infected and uninfected poultry. Backyard poultry are geographically clumped in southern California with small numbers of poultry at many adjacent homes and only a few meters often separating poultry at one home from the next. During the 2002\u20132003 END outbreak, homes with ENDV-infected poultry were often very close to each other, forming a cluster that was distinct within the somewhat larger geographic clumping of backyard poultry (C.J.C., unpublished data). In addition to fly dispersal, movement of birds or personnel between these clustered homes also may have occurred.",

(1974). Fly control measures would be especially important for a quarantined poultry facility (to include backyard flocks) before removal of birds and their manure by a state and/or federal task force as part of the disease eradication effort. Removal of birds and manure would be expected to encourage fly dispersal into the surrounding area. It is recommended that future END task force organizations consider the use of insecticides providing rapid knockdown of adult flies immediately before initiating eradication efforts at commercial and backyard poultry facilities and that control measures continue throughout the period of manure removal and site disinfection.",
