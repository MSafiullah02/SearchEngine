            "text": "Viral fusion is mediated by specialized proteins, which harbor a structural motif that consists of a repeating pattern of seven amino acids: the heptad repeat (HR). The most prevalent class (class I) of fusion proteins typically has two HR regions: the first one close to the N\u2010terminus (HRN), adjacent to the fusion peptide, and the second one close to the C\u2010terminus (HRC), immediately preceding the transmembrane domain. It is generally accepted that in the key intermediate of viral fusion, the so\u2010called prehairpin intermediate, bridging the viral and cell membranes, the HRN and HRC regions are separated, and the HRN forms a trimeric coiled coil (Figure 1). Folding of the HRC onto the HRN trimer leads to the formation of a six\u2010helical bundle (6HB), and in this process, the two membranes are brought in close apposition, which leads to their fusion 11 (Figure 1). Peptides corresponding to the sequence of the HR regions can bind to the prehairpin intermediate, prevent its transition to the 6HB, and block fusion (Figure 2(A)). This is the mechanism of inhibition of enfuvirtide 12, which applies to several other peptides derived from the HR regions of many viruses 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.",

The resulting increase in local concentration at the site of action would translate into enhanced antiviral potency (Figure 2(B)). Application of this concept to the HR\u2010derived peptide C34 yielded C34\u2010Chol, where the cholesterol group was attached, via a thioether bond, to the side chain of a Cys residue added to the C\u2010terminus, with an intervening Gly\u2013Ser\u2013Gly spacer. Cholesterol conjugation brought a dramatic improvement of antiviral potency: Depending on the viral strain tested, C34\u2010Chol was 25\u2010 to 100\u2010fold more potent than unconjugated C34 and 50\u2010 to 400\u2010fold more potent than enfuvirtide 78.

The lead ID phase would consist in the bioinformatic analysis (e.g. via LearnCoil 30 or MultiCoil 31, 32) of the newly sequenced genome to identify the HR regions; it could last a few days. As discussed in the previous section, the computational identification of inhibitory peptides for viruses utilizing class II or III fusion proteins would be less straightforward, and the number of candidate peptides to be tested likely larger. However, given the high throughput of parallel solid\u2010phase peptide synthesis and the modularity of the cholesterol conjugation reaction, the initial number of target sequences should not represent a key limiting factor in the lead optimization (lead opt) phase. In lead opt, candidate peptides would be synthesized in the form of suitable precursors for cholesterol conjugation and reacted with the reagents shown in Figure 3 or similar ones. The cholesterol\u2010conjugated monomers and dimers would be tested for antiviral activity. In the logic of off\u2010the\u2010shelf reagents for immediate use, variations of the reagents of Figure 3 to optimize the length of the linker joining the monomers might provide considerable increase in potency 89, as shown by Kay et al. 91.
