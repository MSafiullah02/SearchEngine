It is well established that the majority of asthma cases start early in life. However, a significant proportion of children that wheeze at a young age, mostly secondary to upper respiratory viral infections (URIs), overcome their problem before school age. These subjects, characterized as transient early wheezers, have reduced airway function at birth; thus it is likely that their disease is at least partly of a mechanical rather than purely of an immunologic nature [8] . Other children start wheezing early and continue to do so, at least until adolescence. These persistent wheezers have an altered immune response with a rise in IgE levels during their first reported URI but no reduction in eosinophil numbers during the acute phase of the URI, in contrast to transient wheezers [9] .",

Severe bronchiolitis in early life is related to subsequent wheezing and therefore may represent a marker of susceptibility to asthma; alternatively, it could be involved in the initiation of the disease. Finally, it is possible that some infections may protect from the development of asthma and allergies by promoting a type-1 host response. However, whether respiratory or other viruses could mediate such a protective effect is debated. The design and implementation of novel anti-or proviral strategies targeting asthma depends on the resolution of these questions.

Equally conflicting are the results relating to potential effects of RSV in allergic sensitization. One group has shown that RSV bronchiolitis is an independent risk factor for the development of asthma and allergic sensitization at age 7 years, in fact a stronger risk factor than is family history of asthma [15\u2022 ]. In contrast, other studies have failed to establish such an effect [16,17\u2022] . Differences in disease severity and age of evaluation may partly account for this discrepancy. It is conceivable that severe RSV disease may be required for the establishment of long-lasting effects. In another study, the correlation of RSV bronchiolitis with Figure 1 . Pathogenesis of asthma in early life. Children with small airways at birth develop a wheezing syndrome triggered by viral infections, which resolves before school age (upper panel). Severe RSV bronchiolitis in early life may lead to immune deviation, lung damage, or both, leading to persistent asthma (1). Alternatively (2), children with genetic susceptibility to asthma may present with severe bronchiolitis and continue to wheeze with various stimuli. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive (3) . A predisposition to RSV infection may result in severe bronchiolitis, further increasing the possibility of persistent asthma. However, because the severity of bronchiolitis might be influenced by other factors, mild RSV disease may delay asthma onset, result in milder symptoms, or even not induce asthma. Double bars across an arrow denote that the circumstance is not thought to lead to the indicated result. RSV-respiratory syncytial virus. sensitization that was observed at age 6 years was not present at age 9 to 10 years [18] . Importantly, RSV-related effects on wheezing and asthma decline with age, becoming nonsignificant by adolescence [17\u2022,18,19] . These findings should also be interpreted with caution: asthma symptoms may be undervalued in adolescence or they may relapse later in life [20] ; thus, prospective evaluation of the current cohorts is required to evaluate these possibilities.",

These findings could be explained as either an inherent defect or a direct result of the RSV infection itself. Recently, we also observed a profound imbalance in infants with acute RSV bronchiolitis, with significantly reduced production of the type-1 cytokines interferon (IFN)-\u2425, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-18 and increased production of IL-4 (Legg et al., unpublished data, 2000). This imbalance was associated with impaired virus clearance, which suggests that this imbalance may be an important mechanism in determining disease severity. In addition, because the imbalance was observed as early as the 1st or 2nd day after initiation of disease, the immune deviation was almost certainly already present in these infants before RSV infection; deviation of the immune response by the virus itself is highly unlikely to have occurred so early in the course of the illness, when virusspecific immunity is only beginning to develop.",

Stein et al. [17\u2022 ] reported a fourfold increased risk of asthma later in life in children with RSV infections that were severe enough to lead to a pediatric consultation early in life. However, increased risks of two-to threefold were observed with other respiratory viruses, suggesting that any single acute infection severe enough to lead to a pediatric consultation early in life is also a risk factor for asthma later in life. A likely explanation for this observation is that these infants have impaired type-1 immunity, leading to increased illness with viral infections in infancy and putting the infants at risk for the development of allergic sensitization and asthma later in life.",

It was proposed that infection in early life, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, might prevent the development of allergic diseases. Consequently, improved hygienic standards in westernized societies, as well as increased use of antibiotics and widespread immunization programs, may facilitate the development of allergic diseases by decreasing the prevalence of infections. In addition to its conceptual attractiveness, this hypothesis fits with our current understanding of the immunologic framework of allergic disease, ie, an impaired transition from type-2 immunity in the fetus to the mature type-1 response in normal children and adults, possibly mediated by an antigenically rich (dirty) environment, of which infections are an essential element (Fig. 2) [25] . This is supported by epidemiologic studies that reported an inverse relationship between asthma and the overall burden of respiratory infections in different communities [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

In a study in West Africa, childhood measles seemed to protect against asthma in early adulthood [32] .

It has been recently documented that the protection from allergy and asthma that is conferred on children living on farms can best be explained by close exposure to livestock and poultry, which are rich sources of bacterial stimulation and endotoxin [34] . In support of this concept, a recent study showed that indoor endotoxin exposure early in life may protect against allergen sensitization [35\u2022\u2022] . Unfortunately, there are also several reports, including very recent ones, demonstrating a positive correlation of bacteria or endotoxin exposure, not necessarily in early life, with increased asthma severity [36] .",

Although there are significant differences in the composition of the intestinal flora between normal and atopic children [37] , further studies are required to assess whether this is a causal association and what its potential effect on asthma may be. Nevertheless, in Italian military recruits, the prevalence of atopy was significantly lower in subjects positive for hepatitis A virus antibodies [38] . More recent data from the same cohort include antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Helicobacter pylori in the \"protective\" effect [39\u2022\u2022] . Measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus had no effect in the same study.

The reason being that a high overall exposure to these agents is likely to promote type-1 immunity and provide protection against the development of asthma. In contrast, when examining individual infections such as RSV, subjects developing severe illness are likely to have impaired type-1 immunity, thus putting them at increased risk of developing asthma. Other individual infections-such as measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox-infect only once, and almost all people are infected or immunized during childhood. Thus, they are not likely to reflect the overall load of infectious agents and would not be expected to be associated with protection against the development of asthma. In support of this interpretation, Illi et al. [40\u2022\u2022] recently reported that infants with frequent \"sniffles\" during the 1st year of life (ie, frequent URIs) are protected against the development of asthma later in life. Further such studies will help explain why some individual childhood infections may correlate to an increased rather than a decreased odds ratio for asthma, even though the protective effect of family size (or repeated or frequent infections) remains [41] .",

Early reports showed that viral shedding decreased soon after the cold, before the patient referred to their physician or the hospital, indicating that early sampling was necessary for viral detec- tion [42] .

In addition, when daily forced expiratory volume in 1 second was monitored, a variable airway obstruction was observed [52] . When normal and atopic rhinitic subjects were compared, lower airway responsiveness was more affected in the allergic group [53] . However, in another study, experimental RV infection induced small changes in either upper or lower airway symptoms in normal and asthmatic subjects, with no effect on bronchial reactivity, leading the authors to suggest that RV infection by itself may not be sufficient to provoke clinical worsening of asthma [54] . Exposure to allergen during a respiratory viral infection is the most obvious cofactor, because it is well known that RV experimental infection enhances the responses to inhaled allergen [55] and potentiates inflammation after segmental allergen bronchoprovocation [56] .",

An inverse correlation between nasal eosinophils at the time of inoculation and eventual cold symptoms was also observed, suggesting that an allergic response might protect from RV colds. Although this evidence seems contradictory to most previous findings, it could prove helpful in several ways. First, it suggests that eosinophils may be involved in RV immunity [58] . Furthermore, it indicates that allergen exposure and viral infection do not have a simple additive effect, and timing or dosage may be important.",

Among these, direct virus-mediated damage to lower airway epithelium is a characteristic of several viruses including influenza and RSV. Dead epithelial cells drop into the airway lumen, inducing or increasing airway obstruction. However, the ability of RVs to infect the lower airways or induce cytotoxicity has long been debated. One of the most frequent arguments against this possibility has been the alleged preference of these viruses for a 33\u00b0C environment, as in the nasal cavity, and their suboptimal replication at 37\u00b0C, as in the lung. However, when we compared the ability of a range of RV serotypes and wild-type strains to replicate at either 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, we found differences to be relatively small and certainly not prohibitive of RV replication [59] .",

Using in situ hybridization, we showed conclusively that RV RNA, of both the genomic and replicative strand, can be found in the bronchial mucosa of subjects with an experimentally induced common cold [61\u2022\u2022] . Most interestingly, in both of the above studies the induction of a cytopathic effect of RV in HBEC was shown, indicating that under some conditions [61\u2022\u2022] , or with some strains [60\u2022] , there can be a cytotoxic effect on the epithelium (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, infection of HBEC with RV resulted in mRNA expression and production of IL-8, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [60\u2022] or IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and IL-16 [61\u2022\u2022] . These studies strongly suggest that RVs infect the lower airway and induce a local inflammatory response that could represent the first step in the pathogenesis of an asthma episode, adding to and clarifying previous attempts to prove this notion [62, 63] .

Among respiratory viruses, RSV, influenza, and parainfluenza are more extensively studied in animal models. Sensitization of BALB/c mice to the virus attachment protein (G) of RSV, followed by live virus infection, leads to pulmonary eosinophilia and type-2 cytokine production. Although IFN-\u2425 is still the dominant T-cell cytokine, a localized relative reduction of IFN-\u2425 mRNA expression with concomitant increase of IL-4 and IL-5 transcripts has been reported [68] .

However, we have recently observed that Asthma RV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic asthmatic subjects produce significantly lower IFN-\u2425 and IL-12 and significantly higher IL-10 and IL-4 than do cells from normal individuals (Papadopoulos and Johnston, unpublished data, 2000) . Although IFN-\u2425 remained the dominant T-cell cytokine in this model, a shift towards a type-2 response may be involved in the induction of an asthma exacerbation by mechanisms similar to the ones described above for RSV in the mouse.",

The most conclusive evidence exists in relation to viral URIs and subsequent asthma exacerbations. However, several questions must be answered before this information becomes clinically useful. It is likely that viral infections interact with allergen exposure in the induction of asthma exacerbations, but the sequence of events and mechanisms are largely unexplored. As new therapeutic modalities against viruses become available, it is imperative to search for windows of opportunity for antiviral treatment in the context of asthma exacerbations.",

Individual infections such as RSV are associated with an increased risk of asthma, most likely because of impaired type-1 immunity. Conversely, there is strong evidence that improved hygiene or a reduced overall load of exposure to infectious agents early in life may be responsible for the increase in allergy and the asthma epidemic. Although these data could spontaneously lead to the conclusion that we should change to a more \"natural\" or \"dirty\" lifestyle, we should bear in mind that improved hygiene was imposed because of the significant morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases in previous eras. More detailed studies are thus required to identify the best way to train our immune systems without threatening our health and to identify those in whom such treatment will be of most benefit.",
