Viruses remain the most common form of lower respiratory tract infection in children, especially in neonates. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia continues to be most prevalent in younger children as well, most often affecting children less than 5 years of age who are otherwise healthy. Despite immunizations and public health initiatives, the most common bacterial causes of CAP have remained largely unchanged over the last several decades and include: Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , Haemophilus infl uenzae (including non-typable strains) and Moraxella catarrhalis . Pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised host provides a much broader differential and must be aggressively treated without delay. This chapter will also address various imaging modalities and typical fi ndings with pediatric pneumonia. Methods for pathogen identifi cation are broad and range from non-specifi c markers of illness to invasive techniques for culture. The mainstay of therapy continues to be antibiotics tailored to the patient and presumed etiology; more novel therapies may include corticosteroids or macrolide antibiotics for immune modulation. In those patients with pneumonia with effusion or empyema, drainage therapies with thoracostomy tubes or a VATS procedure may be indicated.",

Pneumonia remains an important cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. There are nearly two million pneumoniarelated deaths worldwide each year among children 5 years of age and younger [ 3 , 4 ] .

In the developed world, early recognition and availability of antimicrobial therapies and respiratory support have lessened the mortality of pneumonia, but its morbidities remain. While widespread use of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000 was associated with fewer pneumonia-associated complications in infants <1 year of age, complications remained unchanged or increased in school-age children and adolescents [ 5 ] . Thus, despite our best efforts at prevention through vaccination, morbidities continue to plague our patients and pneumonia remains a common cause of pediatric hospital admission.",

Anatomic and cellular protection serves as the fi rst line of defense against potential pathogens. Airway mucus traps inhaled toxins and microbes and helps to transport them up and out of the respiratory tract via ciliary beating and cough, a mechanism referred to clinically as mucociliary clearance [ 14 ] . When the microbe burden or virulence of the organism surpasses the abilities of these simple mechanical protections, the innate immune response is activated. The innate immunity is responsible for immediate recognition and control of microbial invasion. In mammals, conserved receptors enable rapid recognition of pathogens to begin elimination of the infection as well as initiate the adaptive immune response. Activating the innate immune receptors in the airway epithelium leads to mobilization and activation of dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells that amplify antigen recognition, antibody production, and further cellular recruitment and infl ammation [ 15 ] . The specifi cs of these interactions and signaling cascades are beyond the scope of this chapter, but are further discussed in other chapters within this text.",

[ 12 , 13 ] to overwhelm defensive measures and result in pneumonia vary and depend on host conditions. The most common mechanism of pathogen entry is via inhalation of infectious particles, particularly in the case of specifi c organisms that spread via respiratory droplets such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Many viruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections are also spread utilizing aerosolized modes of transmission, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infl uenza, and rhinoviruses. Due to their smaller size compared with bacteria, viruses consolidate more effi ciently on smaller particles [ 16 , 17 ] . Hematogenous spread results in pneumonia when bacteria in the bloodstream directly deposit in lung tissue. Pulmonary aspiration can occur as a result of swallowing dysfunction, gastroesophageal refl ux, anatomic anomalies such as tracheoesophageal fi stulas, or an inability to protect the airway from oropharyngeal secretions. In the PICU, many patients have neurologic diseases that coexist with one, if not several, of these aforementioned mechanisms. Furthermore, impaired consciousness, as may occur with head injury, intoxication, sedation, and tracheal intubation, can also impair the ability to protect the airway, diminish the cough refl ex, and exploit the patency of the anatomical connection between the larynx and trachea [ 9 , 10 , 18 ] . Direct aspiration of a large inoculum of infectious organisms can result when there is impairment of the host's anatomic defense, usually the gag and cough refl ex. This most commonly occurs in children with profound neurologic impairment or during tracheal intubation [ 19 , 20 ] .",

Viruses have been found in approximately 50 % of sampled patients with a range of 43-67 %, although this prevalence is diffi cult to compare across studies that utilize different identifi cation techniques [ 22 -28 ] . The most commonly noted infectious viruses were rhinovirus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Human bocavirus, fi rst described in 2005, is detected in up to 10 % of children with respiratory infections [ 31 ] . However, co-infection with another virus occurs in more than half of human bocavirus infected children, making its role as a predominant respiratory pathogen unclear. One possible explanation for the high prevalence of viral coinfection with human bocavirus is that this virus is shed in respiratory tract secretions for a longer period of time than other viruses [ 32 -34 ] .

Thus, the approach to an immunocompromised patient must be altered to consider the type and severity of immunodeficiency, as well as the temporal pattern after chemotherapy or transplant. Other considerations that are important in immunocompromised patients include neutropenia, where a low white blood cell count can hinder the patient's ability to exhibit CXR fi ndings and the lack of infl ammation can alter the clinical presentation, and environmental factors and exposures that can cause geographic and temporal clustering of pathogens [ 11 ] .",

In the early post-transplant period (<1 month), infections from nosocomial or iatrogenic sources are most common. In the middle post-transplant period (1-6 months), donor-associated and opportunistic infections, including reactivation of latent infections, predominate; specifi c causes include Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6). Late post-transplant period (>6 months) etiologies include community-acquired infections as well as infections associated with profound immunosuppression [ 36 , 37 ] . In an effort to diminish the risk associated with post-transplant immunosuppression, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, high-dose corticosteroids) are used sparingly when possible and most protocols include anti-viral (especially CMV), anti-fungal, and Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) prophylaxis [ 36 ] . Still, many common infections continue to pose a great risk. For example, viral infections (e.g., RSV, infl uenza, adenovirus) cause greater virulence following solid organ or stem cell transplantation immediately after transplant when cellular immunity is profoundly low. Later in the course of transplantation, fungi such as Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. become more prevalent causes of pneumonia with long-term steroid therapy [ 11 , 37 ] . Thus, when a pulmonary process is suspected, aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals must be employed. Immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infi ltrates may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and, thus, often require ICU care. Infection must be aggressively treated without delay, but other conditions must also be sought including pulmonary hemorrhage, malignancy, idiopathic pneumonitis, or cardiac disease [ 11 , 38 ] .",

In critically ill children with respiratory failure from pneumonia, prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antimicrobials is crucial. One study in pediatric patients with CAP showed that longer delays in receipt of antibiotics were independently associated with adverse outcomes [ 55 ] . However, antibiotic resistance is increasing and the principles of appropriate antibiotic utilization must be adhered to: use of drug with narrowest spectrum, aiming for high tissue penetration, short half-life, and abiding to a short, intense duration of therapy [ 7 ] . The duration of therapy is typically 7-14 days, with 10 days being the best studied. A 7-day course may be reasonable in non-severe cases of pneumonia [ 12 ] . The choice of antimicrobial agent is based on many things including the patient's age, the type of pneumonia, and clinical and epidemiologic factors. Recent guidelines published by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America offer guidance for empiric antibiotic selection in children hospitalized with CAP (Table 6. 3 ) [ 12 ] .",

In younger children, an elevated IgM titer is often diagnostic; in older children, the fi nding of at least a quadrupling of serum antibody levels between the acute phase and convalescence is diagnostic. Cold agglutinin titers lack sensitivity and specifi city and thus are no longer recommended separate serum specimen because some agents (e.g., piperacillintazobactam) may cross-react with the assay. If invasive aspergillosis is suspected in high-risk patients, serial sampling is recommended. The false positive rate is higher in children than adults [ 91 , 92 ] Adapted from McIntosh [ 6 ] . With permission from Massachusetts Medical Society disease (RAD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ 56 ] . The infl ammatory responses in pneumonia and ARDS are similar with increases in pro-infl ammatory cytokines concurrent with illness severity; severe pneumonia can often progress to acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS [ 57 -59 ] . While preclinical data support the use of steroids, current studies have not demonstrated a reduction in mortality among corticosteroid recipients compared with non-recipients. Several trials, however, have shown some secondary benefi ts of steroids, including reduced length of hospital stay and reduced infl ammatory markers [ 60 , 61 ] . In contrast, a multi-center, retrospective cohort study using administrative data found that among patients not receiving concomitant beta-agonist therapy (used as a proxy for wheezing), corticosteroid recipients had a longer LOS and higher readmission rate compared with non-recipients [ 62 ] . At present, the lack of high quality data supporting the effi cacy of corticosteroids prevents the recommendation for the use of steroids in most patients with severe pneumonia. However, corticosteroids may provide benefi t to certain subgroups of patients such as those with acute onset of wheezing and those who meet the criteria for ALI/ARDS [ 59 ] . Macrolide antibiotics have important anti-microbial as well as anti-infl ammatory properties, though the relative importance of these two mechanisms in children with pneumonia is unknown. In adult studies, macrolides have recently been touted for their immunomodulatory effects and clinical benefi t in multiple chronic pulmonary conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fi brosis (CF). The specifi c immunomodulatory effects are vast and include inhibition of intracellular signaling to suppress the production of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB and decrease production of infl ammatory cytokines that recruit neutrophils [ 63 , 64 ] . Several recent studies in adult patients with severe CAP and sepsis have shown a benefi t in survival in patients treated with macrolide antibiotics in addition to the recommended antibiotics based on pathogen [ 63 , 65 -68 ] . The role of macrolides in children with pneumonia is unclear. In pediatrics, several small retrospective studies have shown that among children with atypical CAP, those treated with macrolides were less likely to have persistence of signs and symptoms after 3 days of therapy [ 69 , 70 ] . Among children with M. pneumoniae infection, Lu et al. found a shorter duration of fever among macrolide recipients compared with non-recipients [ 71 ] . Finally, a large multi-center study of 690 patients with M. pneumoniae infection defi ned by discharge diagnosis codes, the median length of hospital stay was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-6 days); macrolide recipients had a 32 % shorter length of stay compared with non-recipients [ 72 ] .",

The progression from simple parapneumonic effusion to empyema occurs in stages that represent a continuous spectrum (Table 6 .4 ) [ 77 ] . In the fi rst stage, there is a rapid infl ux of exudative fl uid into the pleural space as a result of increased pulmonary interstitial fl uid traversing the pleura and an increase in vascular permeability due to pro-infl ammatory cytokines. The pleural fl uid is marked by the absence of bacteria, fl uid pH >7.20, normal glucose, and LDH <3 times the upper limit of normal. At this stage, drainage is not generally required for resolution but if the effusion becomes large and piperacillin-tazobactam if concern for gram negative enteric bacteria IV cefotaxime if >20 days of age Adapted from Refs. [ 8 , 12 ] impairs respiratory mechanics, drainage might become necessary. The fl uid in the pleural space can fl ow freely and often layers along the lateral chest wall in decubitus fi lms or along the posterior chest wall in supine fi lms [ 37 , 78 ] ( Fig. 6.4a , b) . If left untreated, exudative effusions can progress to fi bropurulent effusions characterized by the new presence of bacteria or positive microbial cultures. Cellular lysis and phagocytosis in the fl uid can result in pH < 7.20, higher LDH, and low glucose. Loculations begin to develop, causing these effusions to now be referred to as \"complicated.\" A chest radiograph may be diffi cult to interpret with respect to evidence of complicated effusions. Thoracic US is more accurate than chest radiographs in distinguishing simple from complicated pleural effusions. Complicated effusions are associated with fl oating debris and echogenic material or septations. Ultrasound is also useful in guiding pleural aspiration and drainage. Chest computed tomography (CT) may be indicated to better defi ne pulmonary and pleural anatomy. Thickening of the parietal pleura on a contrasted CT scan is suggestive of empyema, even if the effusions are small in size ( Fig. 6.4c ) . Finally, stage three is the organizing phase where fi broblasts grow into the pleural space and eventually results in a pleural peel, restricting chest mechanics. This stage often necessitates surgical decortication, especially if there is restrictive impairment [ 78 ] .",

The medical options include appropriate antimicrobials and chest tube insertion with or without fi brinolytic therapy. Surgical options include video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open thoracotomy and decortication. Recent guidelines concluded that chest tube drainage with the addition of fi brinolytic agents and VATS are equivalent methods of treatment and emphasize the importance of local expertise in determining the optimal approach for individual patients [ 12 , 86 ] . VATS has gained popularity over conservative medical therapy as a way to directly visualize the pleural space, mechanically disrupt the adhesions, and strategically place the chest tube for optimal drainage [ 73 , 87 ] . The higher cost and risk of anesthesia with VATS must be balanced against the more frequent requirement for additional drainage procedures for those undergoing primary chest tube placement.

To date, at least two prospective trials in pediatrics have been completed directly comparing these methods. Both trials failed to show any outcome superiority with surgical management [ 80 , 88 ] . Certainly children who have a very high white blood cell count in their pleural fl uid (> 15,000), poor output drainage by chest tube, low pleural pH, the presence of bacteria in the pleural fl uid and/or bloodstream, or failure of medical therapy alone may benefi t from early VATS [ 86 ] . Patients who underwent VATS required fewer Adapted from Refs. [ 12 , 78 , 93 ] additional drainage procedures, but had no difference in hospital length of stay [ 74 ] . However, one study of adults with empyema found that patients treated with a combination of tPA and recombinant human DNase required fewer surgical interventions and had a shorter length of hospital stay [ 89 ] . Cost-effectiveness, balance of risks, and availability of resources also plays a role in considerations for surgical management. A comparison of multiple strategies for pediatric empyema noted that the most cost effective method was insertion of a chest tube with fi brinolytic therapy [ 90 ] .",
