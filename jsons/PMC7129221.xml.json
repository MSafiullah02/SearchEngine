In fact, the pathogenesis of FIP is hardly understood at all and every advance of science seems to make it harder, rather than easier, to understand. For diagnosis, clinicians use a panel of tests including FCoV serology, albumin to globulin ratio, haematology, cytology of effusion and measurement of acute phase proteins, especially \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP). There are many publications about the virtues and limitations of these tests in cats with FIP, but, as far as I know, Dr. Giordano\u2019s paper, published in this issue of The Veterinary Journal, is the first time that workers have looked at the relevant differences in these parameters in the cats who get FIP and their in-contact cats who remain healthy (Giordano et al., 2004).",

What Professor Paltrinieri\u2019s group does is far more difficult \u2013 following naturally infected cats \u2013 but their results are much more trustworthy and more likely to represent what really happens in the field. Dr. Giordano and her colleagues address the down-to-earth questions: \u201cHow do I diagnose this disease in the living cat?\u201d and \u201cHow do I distinguish the FCoV infected cat from the cat with FIP?\u201d Like Duthie et al. (1997), they found that cats with FIP were likely to have higher AGP concentrations, and that haptoglobin levels were not predictive. But, unlike Duthie, they examined a group of FCoV-exposed cats and asked what was the difference between them and the cats with FIP? This is a question which constantly arises in real life, and Dr. Giordano is the first to present an answer: she found that there was a massive increase in serum amyloid A (SAA) compared with FCoV exposed cats. It would appear that SAA should be added to the panel of tests performed on the suspect FIP case.",

It was extraordinary that when FIP occurred in one cat, the in-contact cats\u2019 acute phase proteins fluctuated. The significance is that these fluctuations did not appear with FCoV infection, but with the development of FIP in one of the cats. If this is truly the case, it would imply that the mutated, pathogenic form, FIPV, had spread to the other cats. Present belief is that for cats to develop FIP, a mutation (more accurately \u2013 a deletion) must occur in the viral genome of non-pathogenic FCoVs (so called enteric coronaviruses) which allows the virus to replicate in macrophages (Vennema et al., 1998). The current theory is that the mutated virus cannot transmit to other cats, although this theory was challenged at SIFFS as delegates had experienced households where many cats had developed FIP, implying that virulent virus had spread (Addie et al., in press).",

In Giordano\u2019s paper, four surviving cats had a transient rise in SAA and the authors ask the interesting question as to whether this increase and the decrease in AGP seen in these cats had some protective role? Although the biological function of AGP is not completely known, it is a natural anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent. Its effects in relation to FIP development could be protective or damaging. Examples of AGP\u2019s protective properties are: (1) it has anti-complement activity (Fournier et al., 2000), and FIP is an immune-mediated disease such that cats which are decomplemented do not develop FIP and (2) AGP\u2019s immunomodulatory and anti-neutrophil activity: in FIP chemokines are released which attract neutrophils \u2013 one of the cell types in FIP pyogranulomas.",

The sialyl Lewis X form of AGP is induced during inflammation and ameliorates both complement and neutrophil-mediated injuries while the non-sialyl Lewis X form does not (Fournier et al., 2000). Moreover, sialyl Lewis X is the ligand for the cell adhesion molecules involved in adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells (Fournier et al., 2000), and one of the earliest stages of the pathogenesis of FIP is the adhesion of FCoV-infected monocytes to the endothelium in FIP vasculitis. Is it possible that development of FIP has got little to do with the virus after all and everything to do with the AGP response of the cat?",

I have followed one cat with FIP over the time of treatment until death and I found that AGP and globulin levels correlated well with response to treatment and improving or worsening clinical signs, whereas repeatedly measuring FCoV antibody titre was unhelpful. AGP and globulin levels fell when the cat responded well to treatment and rose when the cat relapsed, but the FCoV antibody titre remained high. I hope that Professor Paltrinieri\u2019s group will expand this particular area of research in future as it would be especially good to be able to correlate clinical pathology results with clinical response to treatment.
