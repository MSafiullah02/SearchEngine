We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials. Methods: Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID-19 treated with antiretrovirals. Results: From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID-19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant. The second trial found no benefit. The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low. In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low. Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis. Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size. Conclusions: On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19.",

Protease inhibitors have been considered as candidate therapy because they inhibit enzymes that activate envelope glycoproteins as part of the process of viral entry into cells [1] . The use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) has been supported by data from in vitro studies, animal models and positive clinical outcomes when LPV/r was given to patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) diseases also caused by coronaviruses [2] [3] [4] [5] . Other antiretrovirals have been proposed based on virtual screening and in vitro studies, and several clinical trials are planned. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is included in rapid guidance issued by researchers from Wuhan University based on clinical use during prior epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections [6] .",

In this trial 99 patients received LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day; median time between symptom onset and randomization 13 days) and 100 patients received standard care for 14 days. LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. Accelerated clinical recovery and reduced mortality were observed in those treated within 12 days of symptom onset, but not in those treated later. Almost half of patients in the LPV/r group (46 patients, 48.4%) and control group (49 patients, 46.7%) reported one or more adverse events: gastrointestinal-related complaints including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were more common in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. A second randomized trial assessed patients admitted to hospital with mild/moderate COVID-19, and compared outcomes of 21 patients given LPV/r (200mg/50mg twice a day) with 16 patients given ardibol and 7 patients who were not given any antiviral therapy [24] . In this trial, LPV/r did not show any benefit in terms of time to viral clearance (PCR negativity) or progression to severe disease. For both trials, certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias (investigators not blinded to the intervention, and imprecision.",

No statistically significant relationship was found between type of antiretroviral regimen and infection status.

Based on available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes in severe symptomatic disease or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19. Any differences in potential therapeutic effect of LPV/r between SARS, MERS and COVID-19 may partly be due to different clinical presentations; many of the patients had complicated courses including stays in intensive care units and were on multiple concurrent, unproven treatments. Several randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral drugs, including LPV/r, for the treatment of COVID-19, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. While the conduct of such trials is challenging [41] , high quality evidence is needed to improve clinical and programmatic decisions to use antiretroviral drugs for current and future coronavirus outbreaks.",
