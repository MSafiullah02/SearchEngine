As shown in Table 1, someone has violated an arson and the other one has violated a fire sin based on the case descriptions. Therefore, the charge prediction task needs to focus on the description of illegal behaviors, recognizes the difference between two facts and finally classifies them into their corresponding charges. Through this example, there are two difficulties from two different aspects. One is content confusion that there are quite similar descriptions between facts with different labels, such as arson and fire sin. The other is dynamic label number that the number of labels (label number) is not fixed for all the cases. For example, some facts have only one label, but others have multiple labels.\n",

Because they extract several most relevant knowledge (provisions) without considering impacts of the similarity relation between a fact and its provisions and the difference relation between different provisions. In this paper, we try to explore those impacts by our proposed dynamic merging attention (DMA). The DMA gains the self-attention scores of the fact and provisions, and furthermore because of different convolution kernels, it dynamically acquires various representations about the two relations from the scores.",

The two strategies need time and efforts to set parameters manually. In addition, they use a unified k or a threshold value, which causes an increase in errors especially when the prediction probability is not precise. There is a work which jointly learns a multi-label classification model and a threshold predictor to gain different fixed thresholds for the different labels [17]. However, it ignores the co-occurring relation between labels. If a charge is a label of a fact, then another related charge will be also its label with a high probability. Our proposed number learning network (NLN) can automatically learn the number of labels corresponding to a fact by incorporating the co-occurring relation to alleviate the dynamic label number. Specifically, our NLN extracts the relation to acquire the number of labels by a mapping rule and a convolution layer.",

The content confusion will generate the worse label probability, which makes it hard to get the correct number of labels. Similarly, even if we get better label probability, the dynamic label number will cause the number of labels to be wrong, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a relation learning hierarchical framework for multi-label charge prediction with two models, i.e., DMA and NLN. Specifically, we collect the provisions corresponding to different charges as external knowledge and embed them and facts jointly. In our framework, there are two levels, i.e., label probability level and label number level. In the label probability level, we gain a knowledge-free representation by using some state-of-the-art deep models as feature extractors and get a knowledge-aware representation by DMA. Then, we construct a classifier to generate an output probability by these representations. In addition, in the label number level, we build NLN to predict the number of labels of each fact and obtain its charges according to first l ranking sorting by label probability (l is the number of labels). In short, we consider the impacts of the similarity relation, the difference relation and the co-occurring relation under a unified framework to alleviate these two difficulties at the same time.",

With the rise of joint learning, there are also attempts to combine legal article recommendations with charge prediction for multi-task learning [6, 12]; Some studies are based on reading comprehension and hierarchical multi-label classification [11, 16]. Inspired by the success of attention mechanism in NLP task, Wang et al. handled charge prediction task by incorporating an attention mechanism [17].

As shown in the top I of Fig. 1, self-attention provides similarity information for a fact and external knowledge. As shown in the top II and II of Fig. 1, the convolutional layer and the pooling layer dynamically extract some differences from this information. Hence, our DMA can obtain the knowledge-aware representation which contains an understanding for a fact. Compared to our DMA, through external knowledge, soft-attention can only emphasize parts of a fact and it does not obtain the difference relation. Therefore, using soft-attention does not improve our framework and has a certain degree of negative impact. Compared to these attention mechanisms, we observe that our DMA significantly outperform others by dynamically learning the similarity relation and the difference relation. In addition, it also indicates that it is significantly helpful for enhancing our framework with DMA to apply most deep learning models as feature extractors.",

For example, for the DPCNN as a feature extractor, our framework with the models outperforms the other by 4% and 6% on the micro-F1 and macro-F1, respectively. Since our framework is divided into two levels, each level uses a corresponding model to extract different relations, which causes better prediction results. The label probability level obtains a better label probability from the extracted relations, which provides a good basis for the label number prediction. The label number level improves the accuracy of the number of labels by the co-occurring relation and the better label probability. In this unified framework, combining these two levels finally yields better results. According Table 3 and Fig. 2, our framework with DMA and NLN outperforms these baselines by more than 3%\u201323%. For instance, using the Bi-GRU as a feature extractor, macro-F1 of our framework with DMA and NLN is 0.7163 which is 23% more than that of only using threshold strategy. It indicates our DMA and NLN further enhance our framework. In the same way, it shows that we alleviate the above two difficulties by learning these relations together under a unified framework.\n",
