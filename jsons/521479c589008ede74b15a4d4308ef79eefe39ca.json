Immediately after binding to their receptive receptor, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells where they encounter the innate immune response. In order to productively infect the new host, SARS-CoV-2 must be able to inhibit or evade host innate immune signalling. However, it is largely unknown how SARS-CoV-2 manages to evade immune response and drive pathogenesis. Given that COVID-19 and SARS have similar clinical features [7], SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar pathogenesis mechanism as SARS-CoV. In response to SARS-CoV infections, the type I interferon (IFN) system induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to inhibit viral replication. To overcome this antiviral activity, SARS-CoV encodes at least 8 viral antagonists that modulate induction of IFN and cytokines and evade ISG effector function [44]. The host immune system response to viral infection by mediating inflammation and cellular antiviral activity is critical to inhibit viral replication and dissemination. However, excessive immune responses together with lytic effects of the virus on host cells will result in pathogenesis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "ARDS progression and extensive lung damage in COVID-19 are further indications that ACE2 might be a route of entry for the SARS-CoV-2 as ACE2 is known abundantly present on ciliated cells of the airway epithelium and alveolar type II (cells (pulmonary cells that synthesize pulmonary surfactant) in humans [45]. Patients with SARS and COVID-19 have similar patterns of inflammatory damage. In serum from patients diagnosed with SARS, there is increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1, IL6, IL12, interferon gamma (IFN ), IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP10), macrophage inflammatory proteins 1A (MIP1A) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1)), which are associated with pulmonary inflammation and severe lung damage [46].

While SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, other respiratory infections may be more common in a local community. The WHO has released a guideline on case surveillance of COVID-19 on January 31, 2020 [23]. For a person who meets certain criteria, WHO recommends to first screen for more common causes of respiratory illness given the season and location. If a negative result is found, the sample should be sent to referral laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Case definitions can vary by country and will evolve over time as the epidemiological circumstances change in a given location. In China, a confirmed case from January 15, 2020 required an epidemiological linkage to Wuhan within 2 weeks and clinical features such as fever, pneumonia, and has put forward case definitions [23]. Suspected cases of COVID-19 are persons (a) with severe acute respiratory infections (history of fever and cough requiring admission to hospital) and with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation and a history of travel to or residence in China during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; or (b) a patient with any acute respiratory illness and at least one of the following during the 14 days prior to symptom onset: contact with a confirmed or probable case of SARS-CoV-2 infection or worked in or attended a health care facility where patients with confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease patients were being treated.
