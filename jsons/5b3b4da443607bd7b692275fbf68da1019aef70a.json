Fegg's (2013) existential behavioural therapy was shortened to two individual 1-h sessions (short-term existential behavioural therapy). Aim: Testing the effectiveness of sEBT on psychological symptoms of informal caregivers in comparison with active control. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting/participants: Informal caregivers of palliative in-patients. Methods: The primary outcome was depression; secondary outcomes were anxiety, subjective distress and minor mental disorders, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, quality of life and direct health care costs. General linear mixed models allow several measurements per participant and change over time. Reasons for declining the intervention were investigated by Rosenstock's Health Belief Model. Results: Overall inclusion rate was 41.0%. Data of 157 caregivers were available (63.1% females; mean age: 54.6 years, standard deviation (SD): 14.1); 127 participants were included in the main analysis. Participation in sEBT or active control was not significantly associated with post-treatment depression. Outcomes showed prevailingly significant association with time of investigation. Selfefficacy, scepticism of benefit of the intervention, belief of better coping alone and support by family and friends were significant factors in declining participation in the randomised controlled trial. Conclusion: Inclusion rate was tripled compared with a previously evaluated longer EBT group intervention. By shortening the intervention, inclusion rate was traded for effectiveness and the intervention could not impact caregivers' psychological state. Early integration of sEBT and combination of individual and group setting and further study of the optimal length for caregiver interventions are suggested.",

Despite the challenges for caregivers to access interventions due to scheduling difficulties and them having to leave the patient alone, mindfulness showed positive influences on depression, strain and quality of life. 7 Fegg et al. 8 developed existential behavioural therapy (EBT), an intervention aimed at informal caregivers of palliative patients. EBT was implemented in a group setting with a total of 22 h focusing on mindfulness practice, strengthening resources, finding meaning, establishing self-care and developing personal values. Medium to large effects on anxiety and quality of life and medium effects on depression were demonstrated. A weakness of this study was the low uptake of the intervention with 13.6%.",

Level of depression was measured with Patient Health Questionnaire, 9 items; a score >15 is associated with clinical levels of depression, and scores are sums ranging from 0 to 27. 16, 17 Secondary outcomes. Generalised anxiety disorder was assessed using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, 7 items; a score >10 indicates general anxiety disorder, and scores are sums ranging from 0 to 21. 18, 19 Subjective distress was measured using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's Distress Thermometer; a score >5 indicates a clinically relevant level of distress, scale range 0-10, from 'No distress' to 'Extreme distress'. 20 Minor mental disorders were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire, 12 items, with higher scores indicating higher level of mental disorder; scores are sums of item values ranging from 0 to 36. 21, 22 Positive and negative affect were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, with higher scores indicating higher levels of affect; scores ranging from 1 to 5 are means of positive and negative items, respectively. 23, 24 Life satisfaction was measured using the Satisfaction with Life Scale, with higher scores indicating higher degree of satisfaction; scores are sums of item values ranging from 0 to 36. 25, 26 Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, abbreviated version: scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores denoting higher quality of life; scores were built according to the manual guidelines, including handling of missing data. 27, 28 Health-related resource use of the past 6 months (number of physician contacts, physiotherapist contacts, hospital days, and rehabilitation days) was collected using the German questionnaire for health-related resource use in an elderly population (at t1 and t4). 29 Individual costs were added up after assigning a cost to each component based on unit prices published by Bock et al. 30 Three numerical rating scales with one item each measured quality of life, physical impairment and psychological impairment, with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels. Of all the used scales, only in the manual of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, 27,28 guidelines on how to treat missing data were provided: Outcomes were only computed if at least 80% of the items in a scale were available and the missing items were imputed with the mean of the available items. Otherwise the whole observation was discarded. For consistency, we applied this approach to all scales.",
