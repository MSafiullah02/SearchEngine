Here, we use ground-level observations and model simulations to examine the nationwide spatial\u2212temporal variations of six air pollutants before and after the initiation of First-Level Public Health Emergency Response. The level of ambient NO 2 declined significantly, and in most cities, the decline was dominated by reduced emissions. Meanwhile, the level of O 3 increased significantly during this period, and the nonmeteorological factors explained the increase. For the other air pollutants (PM 2.5 , SO 2 , and CO), the observed declines on the national scale were obviously affected by the meteorological conditions. In Wuhan, significant declines were found for air pollutants except O 3 and emissions dominated the changes, while in Beijing during the same period, only the level of NO 2 significantly declined. This study clearly shows that the meteorological changes contributed substantially to the observed changes in most air pollutants, and this must be considered in evaluating the impacts of pollutant source changes on air quality during the specific event and in assessing source-oriented risks.",

For instance, Beijing's average PM 2.5 concentration was 42 \u03bcg/m 3 in 2019. 4 It is close to China's official air quality standard (35 \u03bcg/m 3 ) but still far short of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s guideline value of 10 \u03bcg/m 3 . 5 In fact, there were 180 of 337 cities (53.4%) monitored in mainland China exceeding China's official PM 2.5 standard in 2019. 4 The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in mainland China occurred reportedly in December 2019. 6, 7 The rapid growth in the confirmed case number and deaths led to a series of preventive anti-epidemic measures implemented by the Chinese government. From January 23 to 29, 2020, China activated the First-Level Public Health Emergency Response (FLPHER), which implemented strict travel restrictions involving more than 1.3 billion people. 8 As a consequence, transportation, construction, and light industry activities were dramatically decreased. For example, the total traffic flow across China decreased by 87.7% on January 30, 2020, compared with the same period last year. 9 Such an event had significant impacts on the social\u2212 economic activities and thus on the environment. 10 It is therefore interesting, using the national air quality monitoring network, 11 to look into the changes in nationwide air quality over such a short period. In addition, evaluating the changes in air pollutant concentrations with the exclusion of meteorological impacts is crucial. This study is expected, as a preliminary evaluation, to provide important information about the air quality changes affected by FLPHER due to the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "Air Quality Modeling. It is well documented that meteorological conditions play an important role in ambient air pollution via multiple pathways involving emission, transport, chemistry, and deposition. 13, 14 In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model 15\u221220 were used to evaluate the impacts of the changing meteorology on air quality before and after FLPHER was activated. WRF was driven by the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) 21 and provided meteorological inputs for the CMAQ simulation. The WRF model performance was evaluated, showing good agreement with ground-level observations ( Figure S1 ). The CMAQ simulation covered the entire mainland China at the 36 km horizontal resolution and spanned the period from January 8, 2020, to February 6, 2020, covering all days in periods I and II with the first 8 days for spinning up. To evaluate the changes in air pollution associated with the meteorological conditions, the real-world meteorology informed by the ERA5 reanalysis (Table S2 ) was used as inputs in the model simulation with fixed emissions for 2017 because the real-time emissions for the study period were not available. This brings in considerable uncertainties in model results as pollutant emissions in China are changing, 20 and moreover, significant changes were expected during the specific COVID-19 period. The model here is primarily run to Figure 1 . Changes in the observed weekly average concentrations between the two periods vs the changes that can be attributed to the meteorological differences. In the first and second quadrants, ambient concentrations increased regardless of the meteorological changes, and in the third and fourth quadrants, the weekly average ambient concentrations declined. In region I, the meteorological changes dominated the ambient concentration increases. In region II, emission changes dominated the ambient concentration increases. In region III, the meteorological changes dominated the ambient concentration decreases. In region IV, emission changes dominated the ambient concentration decreases. C+ and C\u2212: observed weekly average concentrations increased and decreased, respectively. M+ and M\u2212: meteorological differences between the two periods resulted in increases and decrease, respectively, in air pollutant concentration based on the model simulation (note that the model has difficulty in accurately evaluating the boundary layer resulting in the uncertainties given here). E+ and E\u2212: emission changes were indicated to increase and decrease, respectively, the weekly average concentrations of air pollutants (the differences between observed and simulated weekly average concentration were positive and negative, respectively). isolate impacts of meteorology and emissions, and the results of the relative changes in air pollutant concentrations from the modeling were adopted in subsequent analysis. Thus, the dayto-day variations for the simulated concentrations of air pollutants were attributed to the impacts of day-to-day meteorological changes as daily emissions were held constant over the simulation period. The variations for observed pollutants concentrations were attributed to the mixed impacts of meteorological changes and emission changes. Subsequently, upon exclusion of the meteorological impacts modeled by CMAQ from the observed overall changes in pollutant concentrations, the emission impacts on air quality between the two periods were isolated. The boundary layer plays an important role in air pollution formation and dispersion; however, it should be noted that WRF and other regional models have difficulties in simulating the evolution of the boundary layer. 22, 23 Therefore, the impacts of meteorological factors may not be completely and accurately captured by the model. The model configurations and performance are detailed in the Supporting Information.",

Ozone formation is complicated by its association with the abundance of NOx and VOCs. 28 At this stage due to the absence of the national VOC concentrations, it is hard to further explore the relationship and formation mechanism(s) here, but it is imperative to look into the process in future work, to evaluate the effect of human activities on ozone pollution and adverse health impacts of ozone exposure. Previous studies also indicate that the decrease in the PM 2.5 concentration may also play a role in the increase in the level of ozone; 29 however, there was no significant correlation found between O 3 and PM 2.5 in this study (r = \u22120.03), which may be related to the differences between winter and summer.",

            "text": "Meteorological Impacts on Air Pollutants. The WRF simulation showed a large-scale increase in temperature over northern China, especially in Inner Mongolia, during period II compared to period I ( Figure S5 ), which could potentially lead to enhanced photochemical formation of ozone and secondary PM, 30, 31 and showed decreases in wind speed and boundary layer height in this region ( Figure S5 ), which could favor the accumulation of pollutants. 30 On the other hand, a decrease in temperature and increases in wind speed and boundary layer height were found in southern China ( Figure S5 ), indicating inhabited ozone formation and a favorable ventilation condition. The change in precipitation was minor in most parts of China ( Figure S5 ) given the ongoing dry season. Figure 1 plots the observed concentration changes against meteorology-induced changes for the 361 cities. As one can see, the observed NO 2 concentrations declined in nearly all cities, while in 53% of these cities, the meteorological conditions would even increase the NO 2 levels if emissions were not changed (the fourth quadrant in Figure 1 ). Only in 20% cities were the NO 2 declines primarily a result of the meteorological changes (regions III in Figure 1 ). Our analysis suggests that changes in emissions contributed to the observed NO 2 declines in 91% cities (the area below the 1:1 line) and were the dominant cause of the NO 2 declines in 80% of the cities (region IV). For O 3 , obvious increases were observed in most cities. In only 6% of the cities, the increases were primarily attributable to the meteorological changes (region I in the first quadrant), indicating that the increases in the level of O 3 in most cities were due to the changes in precursor emissions. In approximately 20% of the cities, although changes in the meteorological conditions would result in decreases in O 3 , the changes in precursor emissions and also probably the nonlinear response of ozone to the precursors during the atmospheric reactions were found to overwhelm the changes in meteorology, ultimately resulting in increases in the level of O 3 (the second quadrant). The 10 cities showing the largest increases in the level of O 3 are all located in the North China Plain, one of the most populous regions in China, indicating a potential negative health effect from O 3 exposure in this region. Note that the changes in O 3 in these cities were all dominated by emission changes. On the other hand, some cities showed decreases in the level of O 3 due to emission changes, and these cities are mainly located in southeastern China (shown in Figure S6 ).",

We, as a proxy to test the robustness of results, further run a sensitivity test by using a different model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry, WRF-Chem) 15 real-time meteorology on air pollution during this period. This modeling platform had been previously used in evaluating the impacts of residential emissions on air pollution in China, and previous works did reveal acceptable results from the modeling platform in comparison with the observation. 32, 33 The WRF-Chem simulated relative changes in air pollution were generally similar to that from the WRF-CMAQ modeling, as shown in Figure S7 and Figure 2 . Therefore, it could be inferred that the observed changes in the short-term air concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and SO 2 in nearly half of monitored cities in the mainland China, and also NO 2 in some cities (20%) during the study period, were primarily due to the meteorological changes, while for the increased O 3 levels, emissions played a more important role. In fact, compared to January 2019, although the monthly electricity consumption of January 2020 for production and supply of electricity and heat decreased by 30%, there were only slight decreases observed for petroleum, coal, and other fuel processing industries (5.5%), the ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry (5.6%), and the nonferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industry (2.3%) (https://www.wind.com.cn/). The weekly operating rate of Chinese blast furnaces decreased by only 4.5% during FLPHER, compared to the week before the activation of FLPHER, and the weekly refinery utilization rates decreased by only 3.5% (https://www.wind.com.cn/). These indicated that primary air pollutant emissions associated with these activities did not decline much.",

Here we specifically examined the temporal changes in air pollution in four representative cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan (Table S3) . These four megacities are located in northern, central, eastern, and southern China, respectively. Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are three megacities in the Beijing\u2212Tianjin\u2212Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta three-megacity clusters, respectively, which are target areas in the plans of the Chinese government to mitigate air pollution specifically (www.mee.gov.cn/hjzl/ dqhj/cskqzlzkyb/). Different temporal variations and distinct meteorological and emission impacts could be found among four cities. In Beijing, the weekly average concentrations of most air pollutants except NO 2 were higher during period II than during period I, and the changes can be primarily explained by emissions. During the 2008 Olympic Games held from August 8 to 24 and the APEC summit of 2014 held from November 7 to 12, the concentrations of all six air pollutants decreased in Beijing due to stringent controls. During those two events, except for the transportation restrictions, some polluting factories in surrounding regions were also closed. During FLPHER, on the other hand, there was no intentional restriction on heavy industry. 34 Additionally, different from those two previous events, the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred during cold seasons when space heating was needed in northern China. It has been well documented that fuel burning for space heating, especially in low-efficiency in-home heating stoves that burn coal and wood in the surrounding rural areas, significantly affects air quality. 35 In the other three cities, the weekly average concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and CO were lower during period II than during period I. In Shanghai, located in eastern China, the level of NO 2 significantly decreased, by 63.9%, primarily due to changes in emission. In Guangzhou, another megacity located in southern China, the levels of PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 significantly decrease by 44.8%, 36.8%, and 77.7%, respectively, and meteorological impacts dominated the declines. Different from the other three cities, in Wuhan, where the earliest preventive measures were conducted due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the levels of not only NO 2 but also PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and CO significantly declined by 31.6%, 34.7%, and 26.0%, respectively. Even though the meteorological changes were unfavorable, the decline in emission dominated the changes in this city, driving the decreases in the concentrations of all of the pollutants except O 3 .",

In addition to the presence of precursors, the O 3 level is strongly affected by ambient conditions like temperature and solar radiation; namely, the high temperature and radiation are favorable for O 3 formation. 36 After the initiation of FLPHER, O 3 concentrations still reached the peak at 17:00 as before, but at much higher levels.

We observed significant decreases in the concentrations for NO 2 in >85% of cities, and most of the declines can be attributable to changes in emission. This is consistent with the remarkable decrease in the level of urban traffic, a major source of NO 2 , during FLPHER. 9 For O 3 , precursor emissions were mainly responsible for the observed increase, while meteorological changes play a relatively minor role. Meanwhile, although the weekly average concentrations decreased in >75% of the cities for PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and SO 2 , most of the declines were not significant, indicating that except for NO 2 , only by vehicle restrictions, such as the license plate restriction, 37 might not be able to significantly improve air quality in most study cities.
