In the community of an Open Source Software project we find developers who usually contribute both in the development and test process. In addition, community members can also be people who do not possess development skills but use the project as end users and contribute to testing. Cerone et al. [2] stress the importance of defining qualitative metrics for indicators of collaboration effectiveness within Open Source Software communities.",

Similarly, Garcia et al. [9] perform sentiment analysis on the e-mail archives of another FLOSS project (Gentoo) and attempt to investigate the relation between the emotions in the mailing list and the respective activity of contributors in the project. Finally, the authors of [10] and [11] analyse comments in an issue tracking system, in order to investigate whether a relationship exists between human affectiveness (emotion, sentiment and politeness) and developer productivity (i.e. time needed for fixing an issue).",

For example, the increased activity of comments in some of the 4.x versions is since 3.6 version was the version that followed the fork from Open Office after which redesign and refactor processes took place. We also chose to let versions with low concentration of comments, i.e. 6.1, to further investigate if this behavior is due to successful bug fixing or it was just a version with low bug tracking activity. In Table 1 you can see the descriptive analysis of the variables we gathered for the sentiment analysis using the tools described in Sect. 4 (Figs. 4 and 5).\n\n",

In Table 2, showing the descriptive analysis of the confidence metric of the sentiment analysis across the versions of Libre Office, we can see that the mean is  > 90% for all the versions. This gives us a first indicator that the confidence of the sentiment analysis (which is done with the MeaningCloud tool) is strong across all our data. In Table 4 we performed a nonparametric test to get results regarding the similarities for the positive, neutral and negative groups of comments between the two tools we have used.

This seems to be intuitively logical if we consider that Bugzilla is a tool to which a community of Libre Office users (many of them voluntarily) report bugs.
