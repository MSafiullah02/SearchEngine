We have constructed an M13 probe from the 5' end of the genome of rhinovirus 14 and used this to detect directly viral RNA. Of the 56 human rhinoviruses so far investigated 54 or 96.4% gave clearly positive hybridization signals. However, the strength of this signal depended very much on the molecular relationship of these viruses. Thus, HRV-3, 4, 17, 72, and, to a slightly lesser extent, 6, 9, 13, 19, 31, 42, 49, 64, and 69 appear to be closely related to HRV-14 whereas 7, 8, 16, 32, 40, 45, 55, 56, 63, 80, 82, and 85 appear to be relatively divergent. Further, evidence is provided in this study that indicates that it would be feasible to use cDNA probes to detect human rhinoviruses in nasal washings. However, the sensitivity of detection was clearly affected by both the inclusion of inhibitors of endogenous RNase activity in the RNA extraction mixture and also in the method of extracting the viral RNA. From reconstruction experiments in nasal washings and under optimal conditions, we can detect virus at 102.8 TCIDs&l.",

Recent surveys in the United States suggest that rhinovirus common colds are responsible for one-third to one-half of all acute respiratory illnesses and it is estimated that these occur at rates of two to five per person per year [for review see Couch, 19841 . These viruses are thus a major cause of morbidity and economic loss especially in the developed world. With the advent of antiviral chemotherapy a rapid virus diagnosis would be imperative prior to specific medication. However, as yet, human rhinovi-ruses can only be diagnosed by isolation in tissue cultures. Virus replication in a sensitive cell line may take up to 8 days before a cytopathic effect appears. Further, the sensitivity of cell cultures to the various serotypes is quite variable. With the great multiplicity of serotypes (over 115) detection of these viruses by serological means is, at present, impracticable.",

            "text": "We have, therefore, developed an alternative approach to rhinovirus detection: that of viral RNA detection using cDNA:RNA hybridization procedures. We have recently cloned and sequenced the entire genome of human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) [Stanway et al, 19841 . The first 624 nucleotides from the 5' end region of the genome encode no open-reading frame of significant length and in common with other picornaviruses are presumed to have a noncoding function. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that this region was highly homologous to the corresponding region of the enterovirus, poliovirus, at the nucleotide sequence level. For this reason we think that it is likely to be relatively highly conserved within the rhinovirus genus and we would expect a cDNA probe from this region of the HRV-14 genome to cross-hybridize with RNA from other rhinoviruses. We, therefore, constructed a single-stranded M 13 template containing the first 800 nucleotides from the 5' end terminus, comprising the whole of the noncoding region plus some of the VP4 coding sequence. We used this template to generate a cDNA probe that was used to establish a cDNA:RNA hybridization system for rhinovirus detection. In a preliminary study we found that this probe does indeed cross-hybridize with a number of human rhinoviruses indicating the feasibility of cDNA:RNA hybridization for rhinovirus detection [Al-Nakib et al, 19861 . We have now extended these studies to include a larger series of human rhinoviruses (totalling some 56 viruses) and looked in more detail at the molecular relationship between these viruses, the limits of detection, and the feasibility of applying these procedures for the direct detection of viral RNA in nasal washings. We have also investigated different procedures for extracting rhinovirus RNA and how these may affect the sensitivity of detection in nasal washings.",

            "text": "It is probable that the strength of the hybridization signal will reflect the titre of the virus. However, as can be seen from Table I , which summarises the extent of hybridization and the virus titres, this is not the only factor. For example, HRV-17, with a titre of lo'.' TCID'o/ml gave a very strong signal (+ + + +) while HRV-41 with a titre of lo7 TCIDSO/ml gave a signal of about half the strength. Similarly, HRV-72 with a titre of lo3.' TCIDSO/ml gave a much stronger signal than HRV-32, which had a titre of lo6.' TCIDSo/ml. These data suggest that although there is considerable homology among the different rhinovirus serotypes, the degree of this homology varies from serotype to serotype. Using the data summarized in Table I it is possible to arrive at a preliminary estimate of the molecular relationship among the different human rhinoviruses. Thus, it can be seen that HRV-3, 4, 17, and 72 are very closely related to HRV-14, at least in relation to the 5' noncoding region of the genome. Also related but to a slightly lesser extent are 6, 9, 13, 19, 31, 42, 49, 64, and 69 . Others such as 7, 8, 16, 32, 40, 45, 55, 56, 63, 80, 82 , and 85 gave much weaker hybridization signals despite most of them having titres in excess of lo'.' TCIDSo/ml and these appear to be more divergent from HRV-14. Table I1 shows the results of virus reconstruction experiments to determine the limit of sensitivity of virus detection in nasal washings using three different procedures for extracting viral RNA. Method 1 was that of phenol/chloroform extraction, as described in this paper, while method 2 was that of direct fixation with 20 X SSC-37% formaldehyde and method 3 fixation with 20 X SSC only. As can be seen, RNA fixation with 20 x SSC-37% formaldehyde was clearly the best procedure, detecting HRV-14 at 102.8 TCIDSO/ml, while that of phenol/chloroform extraction detected virus at lo3.' TCIDSO/ml. Treatment of samples with 20 x SSC provided the least satisfactory procedure since a virus titre of 104.3 TCIDSO/ml was required for detection. However, in addition to detecting virus at lower titres, the strength of the hybridization signals obtained with 20 x SSC-37 % formaldehyde were particularly strong at all virus dilutions in nasal washings compared with phenol/chloroform extraction, indicating that more viral RNA has been immobilised onto the nitrocellulose filters. This particular feature of this procedure will undoubtedly prove important in the detection of viral RNA in clinical specimens.",

An interesting finding is the fact that it would be feasible to detect a large majority of human rhinoviruses by using only one probe. However, this study also demonstrated that the sensitivity of detection using only one probe will depend very much on the degree of homology between the rhinoviruses in relation to the region of the genome from which the probe was constructed. In order to overcome this particular problem and to increase the strength of the hybridization signals, and consequently the sensitivity of detection, a mixture of probes could be used from different regions of the genome and/or from different rhinoviruses. We are, therefore, now constructing probes from the 3' end of the HRV-14 genome as well as probes from other human rhinoviruses to be used in the present hybridization system.",

Clearly there is a considerable genomic homology between the different rhinoviruses, although the degree of homology varied. For example, in this study it was evident that HRV-3, 4, 17, and 72 and, to a slightly lesser extent, 6, 9, 13, 19, 31, 42, 49, 64, and 69 were closely related to HRV-14 whereas 7, 8, 16, 32, 40, 45, 55, 56, 80, 82, and 85 appear to be more divergent. It will be possible to construct a more detailed picture of the molecular relationships between the different rhinoviruses by using probes from a number of rhinoviruses. For such detailed studies it would be essential to quantitate more accurately the hybridization signals and standardize the virus titres (or even better, the quantity of viral RNAs) in the various stocks in order to obtain a precise relative assessment of the molecular relationship between the different rhinoviruses. Such studies will facilitate, perhaps more accurately, the classification of rhinoviruses into groups based on their molecular relationship rather than their serological diversity. Indeed, we hope to pursue such studies and build a more detailed picture of the relationship between members of the human rhinovirus genus. As a byproduct of these studies we hope to learn more about the cross reactivities of the various cDNA probes and hence be better able to select \"universal\" probe(s) capable of detecting many different rhinovirus serotypes and \"specific\" probe(s) capable of detecting specific serotypes or groups of serotypes.",

However, the sensitivity of detection will very much depend on the procedure followed for extracting the viral RNA. We have found that direct fixation with 20 x SSC-37% formaldehyde, as applied for the detection of enterovirus RNA by hybridization [Rotbart et al, 1984, 19851 , appears to be superior to extraction of viral RNA using phenol/chloroform or fixation with only 20 x SSC. Perhaps some of the viral RNA is lost during the various steps of RNA extraction by the phenol/chloroform method leading to a decrease in sensitivity. We have shown previously [Al-Nakib et al, 19861 that the inclusion of inhibitors of endogenous RNase, such as VRC, is essential if viral RNA is to be detected consistently, especially when present in low concentrations, such as those found in clinical specimens. Indeed, our preliminary data on the direct detection of HRV-14 in clinical specimens, such as nasal washings from volunteers who have been challenged with HRV-14 and shown to excrete virus, show that it is imperative to include VRC routinely if rhinoviral RNA is to be detected by hybridization. We hope to pursue further studies on the direct detection of rhinovirus RNA using cDNA:RNA hybridization procedures and to develop in time an appropriate clinical assay. We hope that this assay can then be modified to incorporate nonradioactive probes in order for it to have wider application.",
