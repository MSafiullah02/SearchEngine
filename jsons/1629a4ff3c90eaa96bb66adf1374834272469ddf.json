In Makueni, where levels of formal education are relatively low, our questions have tended to elicit issues of health which are essentially connected with bodily wellbeing. Spiritual and interpersonal concerns, which appear to be of enormous importance, only tend to arise when asking open ended questions when discussing relationships, and do not appear to be understood directly with the local term generally used for the English word 'health'. In contrast, in Vihiga where there is greater education and exposure to biomedical interventions, the local word for 'health' elicits a wide range of responses relating to disease as well as much more general issues about life. or a heavy smoker. Patients who confessed to smoking tobacco also reported lower levels of concurrent QQL, across a broad spectrum of its interrelated aspects, with particular emphasis on vitality, vigor, life satisfaction, restful sleep, and optimism. The more they smoked, the worse their QOL. Age and marital status were associated with QOL in somewhat confounding ways, but even after adjusting for these factors, the smoking effect remained strong and negative. No dimension of QOL appeared to benefit from smoking-nor to characterize smokers as happier than nonsmokers. In this population, either smoking makes people unhappy, or unhappy people tend disproportionately to smoke, or perhaps both. This picture stands in sharp contrast to cultural images which associate smoking with vivacity, contentment, relaxation, energy and happiness. not gained much attention in the literature. The aim of this study was to analyze the perception of distress in leg ulcer patients. Sample: Seventy-eight leg ulcer patients were identified in community nursing in one Norwegian local authority during a three month period. Sixty-two patients (80%) were willing to participate in the study. 63% of the sample were women. Mean age was 77 years (range = 30-92 years). Forty-six patients had suffered from leg ulcer less than 5 years and 16 patients have suffered from leg ulcer more than 5 years.

Formal evaluation of measures of HRQOL, including the SF-36, are part of the core activities of the Pepper Center. Among relatively healthy older adults these studies include: (1) a comparison of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) and three scales of the SF-36; (2) a comparison of the SIP, full SF-36, and 'disability days' measures; and (3) a mailed test-retest of the SF-36. Also underway is a formal study of the validity and test-retest reliability of the SF-36 for relatively non-cognitively impaired nursing home residents. The specific goals of this series of studies are: (1) to test several psychometric properties of these instruments including similarities among dimensions and composite scores of the instruments, (2) to look for possible scale limitations, specifically 'floor' or 'ceiling' effects, and (3) to determine if there are practical administration and response problems among the instruments for specific categories of older adults.",

Fatigue and walking problems are reported as the most prevalent and distressing symptoms. Some type of aid or a wheelchair is required by most subjects for getting around. Friendships receive the highest satisfaction rating, closely followed by family relationships and housing. The lowest rating is for health. In comparison to results from a Statistics Canada survey which asked the same questions, those with MS are less satisfied to a statistically significant degree with health, job or major activity, and life as a whole than are ablebodied and disabled persons in the general population, and they are more satisfied to a statistically significant degree with housing and family relations than are the general population disabled. Quality of life as a whole is very satisfactory for 28% of those with MS. Demographic characteristics such as age and education level are not associated with quality of life, while unemployment and not being in the labour force are associated with decreased quality of life. Any level of household income over $15,000 is associated with increased satisfaction with quality of life. In terms of health factors, there is no apparent association with time since diagnosis of MS. Any severity of MS symptoms worse than mild, and any mobility restriction, are associated with decreased sat-isfaction with quality of life. Experiencing fatigue, and a current disease course or relapsing-remitting/progressive or progressive, are also associated with decreased quality of life. Interference by MS with social activities shows a particularly strong relationship, with increasing interference associated with decreased satisfaction with quality of life as a whole.",

The health states of the EQ are classified as five dimensions of health: (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression) each one with three levels of severity. The levels of the dimensions are codified as '1' if the individual has a perfect health state, '2' if he/she has moderate health problems and '3' if he/she has many health problems in each dimension. This classification generates 35 = 243 possible health states. We obtained values of a set of 15 health states including the best health state (lllll), the worst health state (33333), unconscious and death. The assessment was made on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) by 360 non patients, 240 outpatients, 120 severe chronic patients (diabetes, EPOC, neoplasia) and 100 intensive care unit patients.

In addition, the available data suggests that global QOLA's such as the self-assessed health status question, involve an active process of selecting information that is used to generate the judgment. Examination of the phenomenology of QOLA indicates that the following processes are occurring: descriptions of the state a person is in, scaling of these states, statement of the preferences for being in a state, and finally aggregation of preferences to produce an index. Furberg and Kane have shown that all the available QOLA's can be classified as either including a preference system or not, and providing aggregation rules that permit the calculation of an index or not.

A cohort of 932 injured workers were followed for one year post-injury plus either one week (n = 53) or six months (n = 45) after a total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff decompression. At the second testing they indicated if their condition had changed. These questionnaires included the: Subjective Shoulder Rating Scale (SSRS), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Modified-ASES Form (M-ASES), Shoulder Severity Index (SSI-AF) and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The generic SF-36 Acute was also included. Testretest reliability was assessed on stable one week retest subjects (n = 39) using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) derived from one way analysis of variance. Sensitivity to clinical change was evaluated by change scores and standardized response means (SRM) for patients with six month follow up data.

An empirical study is conducted to investigate whether such a scoring has an impact on final score, i.e. whether a score that incorporates relative importance better reflects patients' own judgment and perception of quality of life by comparing it with a global assessment of quality of life made by patients themselves. Local mental health providers recruited a convenience sample of patients with a DSM IV chart diagnosis of schizophrenia. All were living in the community, all had been ill for some years and all were judged to have severe illness with significant ongoing impairment.

In depth semi-structured interviews with 60 oncologists in the USA and Canada were subjected to content analysis and used to develop a 31 item selfadministered questionnaire. This was pretested to an international group of 28 oncologists. Results of the qualitative analysis and initial pretest were used to develop a new version of the questionnaire (MD-QOL'94) which was based on a predictive model in which physician knowledge about QOL, physician attitude towards QOL, reported current behaviour with respect to QOL, and physician demographics are hypothesized to predict physician willingness to use QOL data.

Further pilot testing on 67 oncologists at a single Canadian cancer centre revealed good face and content validity for the MD-QOL'94 and very good internal consistency for the 'attitude' (a = 0.80) and 'willingness' (a = 0.82) scales. There was a strong association between these two constructs (T = 0.73). Data pointed to ways of improving the 'knowledge' and 'behaviour' scales.

Therefore, a treatment's efficacy at reducing not only the number of panic attacks, but also the symptoms associated with panic disorder should be considered. The purpose of our study was to pilot test the feasibility, validity and reliability of a daily patient diary of panic symptoms. We used an adaptation of the Q-TWiST concept to evaluate patients in Phase III clinical trials comparing fluvoxamine to placebo. Patients recorded their daily feelings of panic, anxiety, phobic avoidance, sickness, and general well-being. We analyzed the proportion of time patients spent in each of these health states. We found that diaries captured a portion of patient well-being that is not reflected in the number of attacks or the standard scales used to measure quality of life. The patient diaries were also more sensitive to the number of panic attacks (Pearson's T = 0.74, p < 0.001) than the standard physician-rated scales currently used.",

The purpose of this research study was to examine the relative impact of health status, meaning of illness events, recurrence, cancer related experiences and uncertainly of illness upon adjustment to disease progression in women with breast cancer. It was hypothezied that meaning of illness would be the most powerful influencing variable and that the relationship between adlustment to breast cancer and meaning of illness would be altered as events of disease progression, as defined by recurrence(s) were experienced. A cross-sectional, exploratory design was used. One hundred and eighty-two women receiving treatment for breast cancer who were newly diagnosed, had a first recurrence or two or more recurrences of breast cancer were accrued from five cancer treatment centres in two Canadian provinces. Participants completed four questionnaires; the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 20(SF-20), the Meaning of Illness Questionnaire, the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Questionnaire. Demographic data and disease and treatment-specific clinical data were also collected. Forty-eight variables were used in the analysis. Modelling techniques of multiple regression analyses, analysis of covariance and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed. Four variables explained adjustment: perceived physical functioning, meanmg of illness, perceived mental well-being and uncertainty. The physical functioning variable was the best predictor of variation in adjustment. Adlustment was not related to disease progression from a new diagnosis to recurrence(s). The levels of adjustment were strikingly similar for the women who were receiving treatment either at the time of diagnosis or for recurrence(s We explored differences by race and gender in ratings of importance of quality of life (QOL) domains assigned by patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (I'D) in developing a disease and treatment-specific instrument for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Response categories were from 1-5 in magnitude of frequency or severity.

Subjects (n = 20) were randomly picked from intake rosters, after being screened for the following criteria: znclusion-over 18 years of age, diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to criteria of the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia (Wolfe et al., Arthritis and Rheumatism, 1990; 33: 160-172) ; exclusion-organic mental disorder or disability, physical trauma, musculoskeletal abnormalities, involved in litigation or compensation suits related to the disability. The SF-36 Health Survey, a quality of life assessment tool (Medical Outcomes Trust), was administered to the subjects pre-treatment, at the end of the treatment period and at 6-week intervals post-treatment period, for a period of 6 months. Preliminary results reported here address only the outcome of the SF-36 evaluations for the pre-treatment, and immediate post-treatment period Pairwise t-tests, pre-and postintervention were used to evaluate change in the eight scales of the SF-36 for the group of sublects. It was observed that there was a significant increase in quality of life as measured by all eight SF-36 scales by the end of the treatment period. When looking at subjects on an individual basis, however, it appeared that subjects fell into two categories: those that showed marked improvement in most scales, and those that showed limited improvement across most scales. In these latter cases, subIects rated themselves pre-treatment as lmited a lot in two categories-physical and emotional role functioning-and did not rate themselves any higher at the end of treatment.",

This paper highlights the need for a disease-specific module for substance use disorders in view of the limitations of the conventional scales, and offers some disease-specific measures which could be included in substance abuse module. QOL scales would be useful in assessing the severity of addiction and in studying treatment outcome. A large number of psychosocial therapies are currently being employed in substance abuse without adequate information about their specific indications and the superiority of one method over the others. Treatment outcome expressed in terms of abstinence or relapse rate is too simplistic. In this regard, QOL assessment would provide more accurate information about the comparative efficacy of the various options available. It would help in identifying the deficit areas of functioning and in patient-treatment matching. The QOL assessment might also help in identifying high risk groups so that preventive measures could be taken. Substance abuse affects QOL of an addict and the family members in certain distinct ways. The various generic scales, though useful in such patients, do not adequately assess the specific deficits and stages of recovery. Certain aspects such as codependency, craving, reintegration to normal life and neglect of important functions in the absence of obvious dysfunction are worth considering while assessing QOL in these patients. There might be a marked disparity between the subjective perception of the QOL by the user and the level of dysfunction assessed objectively.",

The commonest coping mechanisms used were helplessness and fatalism. Resolution was noted as less than 40% of the frequent concerns. As compared to laryngeal cancer, oral cancer patients significantly more often had concerns about current illness, subjective evaluation of health, eating and chewing, social interactions, pain and disfigurement (p < 0.05) and poorer quality of life. In conclusion, most subjects had numerous unresolved concerns, reflecting on their quality of life. Mainly ineffective coping mechanisms such as helplessness and fatalism were employed leading to incomplete resolution. Interventions to minimize these concerns and to handle associated anxiety and depression would improve their quality of life. Quality of life (QOL) research is in its infancy in India. Most of health resources are utilised in controlling the disease and illness by pharmacological approaches that QOL aspects get ignored. Health centres are over populated with large numbers of patients in Inpatient and Outpatient settings, and lack of adequate number of health professionals are other reasons for little attention to QOL. Lack of local, culture-specific QOL measures add to the difficulty of assessment of QOL and intervention to improve it. This overview summarises published reports on QOL in India. Physical illnesses, especially cancer, renal transplantation, cardio-thoracic surgery, physical handicaps and chronic pain have been studied. Among psychiatric disorders, QOL of chronic schizophrenics, alcoholics and substance abusers have been studied. Subjective well-being of healthy women, from rural and urban areas have also been studied. Though sparse, these studies indicate that QOL is relatively better than expected, i.e. better as compared to the physical or psychiatric disability. Further, there is greater emphasis and importance given to subjective and spiritual satisfaction, rather than cross-cultural differences regarding QOL issues between Indian settings and the West. This is the first report of the psychometric properties of MQOL for patients attending an oncology outpatient clinic. MQOL is being developed because of our concerns that most established quality of life (QOL) instruments (a) ignore the existential domain; (b) give the physical domain undue emphasis; (c) do not measure positive as well as negative contributions to QOL; and (d) measure an incomplete list of specific contributors to QOL rather than general QOL determinantsTwo hundred and fifty-four cancer patients at all phases of disease and treatment were recruited during a 7.5 week period from the Royal Victoria Hospital Oncology Day Centre. After giving voluntary informed consent, participants completed the MQOL Single-Item Scale (SIS) (a global measure of QOL), MQOL, the self-administered version of the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (QLI), and six demographic questions. Upon completion of the questionnaires the participants were asked whether any items were unclear and whether there was an area important to their QOL which was not among the items.",

Five subscales representing physical symptoms, physical well-being, psychological, existential, and support domains were constructed based on the results of a principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The four multi-item subscales exhibit internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's CL > 0.84). In the absence of a gold standard against which to test the validity of MQOL, SIS is used as the best available measure of the patient's QOL. MQOL total score correlated more highly with SIS (rho = 0.73) than the QLI (rho = 0.60) or any MQOL subscale or QLI item. The pattern of correlation of MQOL subscales with Spitzer QLI items suggests that MQOL subscales have convergent validity. People with no evidence of disease (NED) following treatment had significantly less problems caused by physical symptoms (ANOVA, p = 0.0020) and significantly greater physical well-being (ANOVA, p = 0.0029) than people with active disease. Overall QOL was slightly but significantly worse for those with active disease compared to the NED group as measured by MQOL Total score (ANOVA, p = 0.0300) and SIS (ANOVA, p = 0.0244). There is a highly significant difference in the same direction for QLI scores (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.0025). Multiple regression of MQOL subscales on SIS was highly significant (p < O.OOOl), with Rzadlusredof 0.59 and 0.52 for the NED and active disease groups respectively. The physical well-being, psychological, and existential subscales were most important in predicting SIS. Physical symptoms and support were less important. The existential subscale was more heavily weighted for the group with active disease than the NED group. We conclude that the results support the hypothesis that the existential domain is important. This is the first evidence that MQOL is acceptable, has reliable subscales, and is a valid measure of QOL in this patient population.",

Handicap is defined as a restriction in the meaningful social roles or activities for an individual following incapacitating illness or trauma, and is seen to be a situational result of an interactive process between impairments (which are abnormalities in the structure or functioning of the body), disabilities (restrictions in the performance of activities generally considered essential in everyday life) and environmental factors. This research project used this WHO framework to investigate the extent to which impairments and disabilities after stroke affect handicap, or quality of life, in interaction with environmental factors. In a prospective cohort study of 450 consecutive hemispheric strokes we examined the determinants of handicap in those survivors who were able to report for themselves at 3 months (n = 147) and at 1 year (n = 151) post-stroke. Handicap was assessed using the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNL), a self-report measure which asks individuals to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of their physical, emotional and social life. Disability was measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) which assesses an individual's independence in mobility, locomotion, self-care, cognition and communication. Stroke-induced impairment was measured using a standardized hemispheric stroke scale. Information on environmental factors such as use of rehabilitation services, living arrangements, and social supports was also collected. We found that disability and impairment were important determinants of quality of life following stroke. Using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc comparison tests, stroke survivors who were more independent and less impaired reported higher RNL scores at three months and at 1 year than those with more severe impairments and disabilities (p < 0.05). However, not all individuals who remained disabled or impaired throughout the recovery period reported persisting handicap. For instance, there was a 75% improvement in quality of life between the two follow-up periods for those who remained dependent in the self care dimension of the FIM (increase in RNL score from 36 to 63 at 3 months and 1 year, respectively).",

Therefore, although disabilities and impairments are important determinants of post-stroke quality of life, they do not necessarily lead to inferior life quality. Some individuals appear to come to terms with their residual disabilities, or perhaps redefine which activities are necessary to them, so that they can reach some acceptance of their post-stroke existence. We need to gain a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms which influence this adaptation process so that health care providers will have more ability to assist in the restoration of optimal quality of life following stroke. The FLIC was published in 1984 and has been used in a variety of settings since that time. It is a 22-item self-report instrument having five subscales: physical well-being and ability, psychological well-being, hardship due to cancer, social well-being and nausea. Answers use a visual analog response format with verbal anchors at the extremes of the scale. An alternative response format is available for illiterate persons. Nineteen foreign language versions are available. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level is six. The instrument is characterized by its focus on the effect of cancer and its treatments on functional quality of life. It assesses not merely the presence or absence of symptoms but their impact on quality of life. Psychometric properties are well established. There are five published factor analyses other than the original which confirm the factor structure. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's a) is over 0.8 for the physical, psychological and nausea subscales and over 0.6 for the other subscales, while a for the entire scale is 0.89.",

The SF-36 was administered twice with an interval of 10 days. Correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the degree of association between different dimensions of the SF-36, test and retest scores, as well as between the different instruments used (concurrent validity). Internal consistency was measured by means of Cronbach's a.",

This has negative effects on the patient as well as on the quality of diagnosis. This prospective study aims at clarifying overall tolerance, detecting specifically anxiogenic parts of the whole process and at developing a model for rational patient management geared to the patients' needs. The study sample consisted of 258 consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic MRI. Pre-and post-scan anxiety levels were determined by self-rating (STAI-Xl; Spielberger) and by a visual analogue scale (VAS) rated by the attending nurse. The patients' attitude towards the examination and their subjective feelings were evaluated before and after the scan with specially developed questionnaires (Imaging Distress Questionnaire, IDQ; Dantendorfer). Adverse reactions and motion artifacts were documented. 84.6% of all patients rated the scan as easy to tolerate, 14.2% as unpleasant and only 1.2% as hardly bearable. The anticipation of the forthcoming scan caused a significant elevation of state anxiety. STAI-Xl revealed a significant reduction of anxiety levels once the scan was over. Between pre-scan anxiety levels and the frequency of motion artefacts no statistical connection could be found. Patients who stated to be worried by the big technical apparatus had significantly more motion artefacts impairing the diagnostic quality (11.5%) than patients considering themselves as not worried (3.2%' p = 0.007).",

However, the lack of symptoms in a large population of hypertensives, the side effects and impairment of Quality of Life (QOL) caused by drugs are the main reasons for patients discontinuing treatment. In 1993 we began the development of an Italian hypertension-specific questionnaire; nine focus group meetings were carried out, using a preliminary 31 item questionnaire designed for use in Italian hypertensive patients. Responses from 117 patients (64 males and 53 females, average age and duration of hypertension respectively 57.1 and 7.6 years) revealed their difficult comprehension of the disease and of their treatments, difficulties of complying with therapeutical regimens, the nature and frequency of drug adverse effects and the burden of lifetime therapy. The most important and distressing clinical aspects of the disease were night awakenings, mood changes, tiredness and constipation. Two psychological dimensions were identified: a general feeling of well being, characterised by not being afraid of high blood pressure or of stopping work through illness, and a low self-esteem, defined by frustrations, worsened family relations, etc. These results gave rise to the categorization of two kinds of hypertensive patients for application in clinical practice. The first, type A, is asymptomatic, self-confident, possibly non-compliant and relatively carefree. Such a patient is likely to respond to appeals to responsibility in compliance. The second, type B, is concerned, constrained, self-stressed and worrie, and probably would benefit from counselling.",

The purpose of this methodological study is to determine the psychometric equivalence of a Tagalog (Pilipino) version of the RAND 36-item health survey 1.0 as a culturally-valid measure of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Filipino-Americans who will comprise the largest Asian group in the USA in the year 2000. The RAND 36-item Health Survey 1.0 was translated into Tagalog (Pilipino) and then independently backtranslated into English using several levels of iteration The first level of iteration used four independent Filipino-American bilingual translators: the first translator initially translated the 36-item health survey into Tagalog; then the second translator reviewed and modified this preliminary version, resulting in the first Tagalog version. The first Tagalog version, in turn, was backtranslated into English by the third translator. The resulting English backtranslation was also reviewed and modified by the fourth translator creating a second English version. The second level of iteration comprised of three panels consisting of four to five ambulatory bilingual subjects who met the eligibility criteria for the study: (a) able to speak and read English and Tagalog, (b) confirmed diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and/or heartproblems, and (c) 18 years of age or older. The first panel reviewed the equivalence of the first Tagalog version to the original RAND measure, creating a second Tagalog version. The second panel examined the equivalence of the second English version to the original RAND measure, resulting in a third English version. Finally, the third panel separately evaluated the equivalence of the second Tagalog version and the third English version to the original RAND measure, leading to a third Tagalog version and the fourth English version. The last level of iteration involved the final expert review of the equivalence of the third Tagalog version and the fourth English version to the original RAND measure by a state-licensed Filipino bilingual translator resulting in the final Tagalog and backtranslated English versions.",

Findings suggest that the number of measurements per person need not be large, that a longer study does not always provide the greatest power, that YHL may not perform as well as a change score, that measuring the health of different people at each time point may have higher power than measuring a cohort of individuals repeatedly, and that a discrete measure of health status may perform as well as a continuous measure.

Therefore, the assessment of the subjective perspective of these patients should be of interest. Unfortunately, a specific instrument for the assessment of quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic venous disease did not exist up to now. We have developed and validated a disease-specific German questionnaire for this purpose, the Venenskala. The questionnaire consists of eight subscales ('Complaints', 'Treatment', 'Functional status', 'Disease-specific fears', 'Mood state', 'Contentedness', 'Social life' and 'Judgement of the disease'), and contains 104 items. It was presented together with two German standard QOL instruments (AL and MLDL) to 100 healthy persons and 100 patients with venous problems in a monocentrical cross-sectional study, and it was tested for its reliability, validity and sensitivity.",

Technical issues include the determination of the number of factors, the skewness of many QOL items, the discrete nature of many QOL items (frequently four-or five-point responses), linearity and scaling assumptions. Over recent years there have been many advances in the methodology of factor analysis. However, most of these developments have taken place in specialised areas of psychometric test theory, and appear little known to most practitioners of QOL studies. We review the current state of the art and discuss the controversial issues and problems that remain with factor analysis when applied to QOL data.

The secondary objective is to provide data for assessing the predictive validity of multi-attribute utility functions estimated for the Mark 3 system. The HUI approach provides both a method for assessing health status (in population and clinical evaluative studies) using a multi-attribution classification system, and a method for valuing that health status, using multi-attribute utility theory The HUI Mark 3 is comprised of eight attributes with five or six levels per attribute. HUI-3 defines 972,000 unique health states. A preference measurement survey, involving 248 randomly selected respondents, was conducted in 1994. The survey involved the use of two preference measurement instruments: the visual analogue scale (feeling thermometer), and standard gamble (a new version of the chance board). Standard gamble scores of prevalent health states were measured on a common (but not conventional) scale, perfect health = 1.0 and PITS = 0.0. Perfect health (PH) is defined as the state having the highest functional level on each of the eight attributes and PITS is defined as the state having the lowest level of function on each attribute. PH (utility = 1.0, by definition) is the most prevalent health state, reported by 29.7% of the general population. The five most prevalent health states cover 63.8% of all respondents in the 1991 Canadian General Social Survey. The 12 most prevalent states account for 75.4%.

In different cultures, different words and sentences have different meanings. We also present some examples of difficulties we passed through in our experiences of cultural adaptations.

The awareness of health care professionals of the need for health-related quality of life evaluations has increased during the past decade. Linguistic and cross-cultural issues are of major importance in the developmental process and validation of health-related quality of life instruments.

The SF-36 will be used continuously as an outcome measure to assess the success of this programme. The ongoing use of a health status measure provided the knowledge to develop a therapy programme for a specific PI'S group. This programme needs to be closely monitored and evaluated.",

            "text": "It may appear that the above categories fit 'neatly' into existing patterns of the HRQOL literature. However, the range of ideas being explored under each of these headings is significantly different in certain cases. For example, 'relationships' includes physical contact with friends and relations, links with the spirit world/religious beliefs, the stability and predictability of family relationships, certain social stigmas, customs of avoidance (e.g. of in-laws) and notions of well-being connected with inter-personal concerns about both the living and the dead. This paper will briefly summarize the principal findings and raise a series of questions for discussion. The predominant concern raised as a result of our research to date is that there are fundamental problems with the 'H' in HRQOL. Much of the literature treats 'H' in the context of biomedical disease control programmes. Some of it treats it in a more general way, linking it with the WHO definition. However in practice this does not reflect local conceptions of health, but instead mirrors mtemational thinking about what health 'ought' to be. Local conceptions of health may not relate to the first of these and may contradict the latter. The objective of this study is to investigate the quality of life (QOL) and medication adherence rates of people with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia 3-6 months postdischarge in the community. People suffering from chronic schizophrenia were recruited in hospital and interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire 3-6 months postdischarge in the community. Reporting was validated using information from hospital and community case notes and carers (where possible). The study was carried out in psychiatric wards in four hospitals in the City and East London health district and the local community. Subjects were inpatients aged 18-64 years with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia and prescribed an injected (depot) form of antipsychotic medication. Patients excluded from the study were those with a history of organic brain disease, those who were unable to complete the questionnaire due to English language difficulties, those who self-discharged against medical advice and those who were discharged outside the study district. Main outcome measures were DSM-III-R classification of diagnosis, severity of illness using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, Lancashire Quality of Life Profile, record of attendance at clinic for depot medication.",

As far as economic analysis is concerned, cost-utility analysis is more and more used rather than cost-efficiency analysis. Quality of life measures are involved in cost-utility analysis. The questions are: Which measure of the quality of life? By who (the patient, the physician, the society)? For what choices?

Further, the use of measures such as mortality rates, standardized mortality ratios, and survival analysis for the assessment of life expectancy ignores variations in morbidity that have a direct bearing on quality of life. In recent years there has been a growing consensus for the use of a more broad-based outcome measure. Many problems in epidemiology and public health statistics may benefit from this approach. This paper introduces a project designed to perform extensive analyses in an ongoing epidemiologic cohort of independent living, older adults from a Southern California community using a broad-based outcome measure. Specifically, in this project we will: (1) examine the cross-sectional relationships between the physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and medical history data obtained in this cohort and health-related quality of life as estimated by the QWB; (2) determine how past physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and medical history data collected on this cohort predict health-related quality of life; (3) evaluate the feasibility of calculating the quality-adjusted life expectancy of cohort subgroups US: ig the methods described in Healthy People 2000; and (4) st two models to predict QWB scores using other data collected at the concurrent visit of this cohort. We are approaching all surviving members of the original 1972-1974 cohort who are now over age 50 years (n = 3,044). Over 90% of subjects respond to an annual mail questionnaire and agree to telephone follow-up if necessary. The follow-up for vital status has been 100% for this cohort. QWB interviews are obtained by telephone within 7 days of the current clinic visit. All data since 1972, including that of the current visit will be available for analysis.

The aim of the study was to investigate if a patient education programme helps to increase quality of life (QOL) for the patient and his family. Is it possible to transfer patient education programmes developed for other chronic diseases to this special group? Are there certain family or coping characteristics that help improve QOL? What kind of psychosocial support is needed for these patients? Do the categories used in systemic family counselling apply to this group or need they be changed?

Four QOL instruments were tested: the SF-36; the EORTC-QOL-C30; the FACTG-B-BMT; and the EuroQoL. Because the data consists of multiple observations over time on single individuals, panel data analysis was used to control for within-subject variation.

Initially, 168 possible HRQOL items were generated based on feedback from interviewing acne subjects and dermatologists as well as literature review. To reduce the number of items, 165 subjects with acne aged 1339 years were recruited from two dermatology clinics and a work site.

The aim of the study was to specify the pattern and intensity of psychosocial burden associated with short stature at different developmental stages and different growth patterns. Therefore we developed a specific parental questionnaire focusing on short stature associated problems which was answered by 177 parents of UTS patients of different age groups (age 6 months-40 years). Nearly all parents reported general short stature associated problems (81% in preschool age up to 95.5% in adulthood).",

The aim of this study was to compare preferences of a long-term care population with the general population, determine if preferences vary by the age of the hypothetical person depicted in the health state case description, and derive weights for new symptom/problem complexes of particular relevance to frail, older individuals. A sample of 38 female and 12 male long-term care residents with an average age of 86 were asked to rate health state scenarios that combined the four health domains of the QWB. This sample rated quality of life approximately of 0.10 units lower (on a O-l scale) than did the general population sample on which the QWB preferences were originally developed. Ratings of the same health state for younger vs. older target persons did not differ significantly (all p's ; 0.05 for f-statistics). Weights derived for 11 new symptom/problem complexes were as follows: disturbed sleep (-0.252), sit-to-stand requires maximal effort (-0. Researchers may have concerns about the distribution of data obtained from quality of life (QOL) scales and impacts of possible non-normality on parametric general linear model (GLM) analyses (regression, ANOVA, etc.). Some scales within QOL instruments are relatively 'granular' measures, having few possible values. In addition, the shape of the distribution of data may be too non-normal for analysis via GLM. Because of these concerns, some investigators have suggested using non-parametric statistical analysis methods for QOL data, however, these statistical methods cannot incorporate important covariates and may therefore be substantially less powerful than GLM methods. Oblectives for this study, then, were (1) to assess the extent to which GLM methods are appropriate for the analysis of QOL data and (2) to evaluate and compare the use of non-parametric with GLM methods for QOL data. QOL data collected during a 16-week clinical trial to assess the effects of study treatment were utilized for this study.

Subjects were adults, aged 18-70, who did not have concurrent musculo-skeletal disease or any condition that impacted their lives more than either RA or FS. In 1991/92, Phase I, 293 subjects completed questionnaires and physical examination. Two to three years later, at Phase II, questionnaires were mailed to participants in Phase I: a) personal characteristics (demographic characteristics and illness history); b) visual analog scales and single item rating of impact of symptoms (pain, stiffness, fatigue, difficulty sleeping); c) Health Assessment Questionnaire-functional ability; d) West-Haven Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory; e) Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue; f) Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression; and g) Quality of Life Index. At Phase II, subjects were also asked to rate their disease as the same, better, or worse than two to three years ago. To date, 76 adults with RA (RAs) and 60 with FS (FSs) have returned completed questionnaires, with 15% (43) returned undeliverable.",

Although time alone does not account for change in physical symptoms or quality of life, perception of disease status is a good predictor of overall impact of the illness on life (confirmed with multivariate statistics). FS has a greater impact than RA on quality of life, in part because of differences in physical symptoms of rheumatic disease and psychosocial response to disease.

The Scale has been used in a variety of validation studies and clinical research investigations. However, the QWB is not used as widely as other measures of health-related quality of life because it is not self-administered and it does not offer a profile of outcomes. The QWB does produce a Quality-Adjusted Life Year calculation that is required for cost-utility analysis. Most competing measures that provide profiles of outcomes can not be used in cost-utility studies. We are in the process of revising the QWB into a self-administered instrument (QWB-SA) The revised measure would produce not only QALYs but also provide the foundation for a profile of outcomes. This paper describes the first phases of the adaptation of the QWB to a self administered form. A content review of the QWB and other instruments revealed the need to add new symptoms and problems. In particular several new items were added to increase coverage of mental health. The self administered QWB can be completed in about 10 minuets and has been shown to be comprehensible to a wide variety of patients at different levels of education and well-being. Several pilot tests led to revisions in format and wording.

Across countries, the average percentage of ordinal pairs ranged from 94.5-99.3 across all scales, and from 88.7% to a high of 100% within scales. Examination of mean values for the response choices supported the 'quasi-interval' nature of the scales, which is consistent with findings from previous studies of multicategorical rating scales and is the reason why some response scales are scored based on values that are not strictly interval. The results of ANOVAs provided strong support for the generalizability of response choice values across countries, Total models explained nearly all of the reliable variance (between 82%-89%) in judgments. Response choice explained between 72% and 88% of the explained variance in judgments across scales. In contrast, country effects, though statistically significant, accounted for only 2%-4% of this variance. The effect of individual differences in judges within countries (7%-18%) was stronger than the country effect. Most of the total model variance not explained by response choice was due to individual judge. These results support the equivalence across countries/ languages of the five sets of response choices evaluated. One or more of these response scales are used in most widely-used health questionnaires and all are used in the SF-36 Health Survey. The results demonstrate the ordinality of response choices within scales and support the interval properties of most of the response scales with a high degree of reproducibility across countries. Departures from the assumptions of equal intervals, where observed, were consistent across countries and were greatest for the two response scales ('excellent' to 'poor' and 'none' to 'very severe') that have been recalibrated in the SF-36 scale scores to date. The practical implications of these departures from equal-interval assumptions for scoring response choice scales warrant further study. Most widely-used health surveys use standardized response choices that are paired with numbers. Yet, the correspondence in meaning between response choices and the numbers assigned to them has long been a matter of debate. For example, is it accurate to assign a value of '5' to 'extremely', '4' to 'quite a bit' and '3' to 'moderately' in a severity rating? Such assignment assumes: (1) ordinality, i.e., that these choices are ordered in terms of magnitude such that 'quite a bit' would appear between 'extremely' and 'moderately'; and (2) equal intervals, i.e., that the distance between 'extremely' and 'quite a bit' is equal to that between 'quite a bit' and 'moderately'.",

Satisfaction with life in general was usually reported to be lower than A study among 200 staff-members of a German psychiatric hospital was conducted for the purpose of analyzing the impact of organizational and cognitive empowerment on occupational health and worksite quality of life in psychiatric services. The general hypothesis that organizational and cognitive empowerment are positively related to quality of worklife by increasing staff members' ability to reduce job stress and to cope with job stress in an active, problem oriented manner, was tested by means of a LISREL path analysis. The study yielded the following results: organizational empowerment, operationalised as degree of participation, influences the level of perceived stress and also the behavioural reactions to perceived stress. The more frequently and intensively staff members participate in the improvement of their working conditions the less they experience these conditions as stressful and, with increasing degrees of participation, staff members tend to cope with job stress in a more active and problem-oriented instead of a passive emotion-focused manner. Because active, problemfocused coping significantly reduces the frequency of psychosomatic symptoms, as the path coefficient shows, participation has a threefold positive effect on quality of worklife: first through a direct reduction of job stress, secondly, by enabling staff members to cope with job stress in a more adequate form, and thirdly by a significant direct positive effect on general job satisfaction. As a general conclusion it will be suggested that the opening of new channels for participation might be an efficient strategy for the improvement of the quality of life of persons working in psychiatric services. self-rated quality of life finding is contrasted by higher correlations of overall life satisfaction with self-esteem (r = 0.64) and with affect balance (r = 0.60).

Significantly higher rates of reported problem were found in social classes IV/V than were encountered for classes I/II. Respondents in lower social classes simultaneously report high levels of problem while at the same time regarding poor health states as not as bad as others think they are.

This paper presents new empirical evidence showing significant variation by social class in the frequency of self-reported 'disability', and in the valuation of respondents' own health status. These findings have serious implications for those who seek to weight life-expectancy for health status.

Mean QOL scores were collated for the following clinical indicators: performance status (F'S = 0, 1,2,3,4), weight loss (WL = 0%, I lo%, > lo%), toxicity (TX = low, medium, high), and extent of disease (local, metastatic (mets)). For each study, and each clinical indicator, the mean difference between adjacent groups was calculated. Sample size calculations were based on a two-tailed t-test at the 5% significance level with 80% power. Estimates are for the number of patients in each group for a study design with two equalsized independent samples. Generally, the largest differences were between performance status groups, and the smallest differences were between groups of patients with local disease and those with metastases. Standard deviations (SD) were very similar between studies. Sample size estimates are: with SF-36 scales. The direction and magnitude of the correlations were as predicted.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in cooperation with the Departments of General Surgery and Medical Psychology, University Hospital of Hamburg, Germany Two hundred and seventyone consenting patients with a preliminary diagnosis of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, liver/gallbladder, pancreas or colon/rectum were stratified by gender and randomly assigned to a control group that received standard care as provided on the surgical wards, or to an experimental group that received formal psychotherapeutic support in addition to routine care during the hospital stay. Data about all medical and psychotherapeutic interventions were systematically collected. Survivors in both groups completed the EORTC-Quality of Life questionnaire pre-and post-operatively, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following surgery Date of death, if applicable, was also recorded. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses were performed. The value for the fifth percentile score of the patient's group was imputed for those who died to evaluate quality of life outcomes. Two-way analyses of variance were then used to compare the groups. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than the control group. The unadjusted significance level for group differences was 0.044 for survival to one year and 0 004 for survival to two years. In a Cox regression model that took tumor staging into account, the significance level was 0.034 for the first year of survival and 0.005 for survival to two years. Secondary analyses found that most of the differences in favour of the experimental group occurred in the patients with pancreatic or colorectal cancer. Following imputation of quality of life scores for those who died, quality of life tended to be better for patients in the experimental group. The results of this study indicate that patients with gastrointestmal cancer, particularly those with pancreatic or colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, bene-Since 1986, patients participating in the Liver Transplant Programme at the University Clinic, Hamburg, have had their quality of life measured before and after surgery in a cooperative study of the Departments of Medical Psychology and General Surgery.

This paper compares extensively the development and validation methodologies followed by three international teams: the European Group for Health and Quality of Life Measurement (Euro-NHP), the International Quality Of Life Assessment (IQOLA) project team and the World Health Organization Quality Of Life (WHOQOL) group. The authors examine the following methodological issues: translation (conceptual and a practical issues, role of backtranslation, quality control), cross-cultural adaptation (role of experts and lay people) and psychometric validation. The advantages and inconveniences of the different options undertaken by each team are discussed in the view of the particular objectives of each project (sequential adaptation of existing instruments; simultaneous or parallel development of an instrument in different languages). They also discuss how to compare crossculturally developed instruments.

These and other perspectives indicate that instrument development efforts must seek to: (1) employ relational items that capture the correspondence between health problems and work role functioning; (2) use domain-specific indicators of functioning that reflect the range of physical, social, psychological and environmental work demands; and (3) incorporate scaling techniques that capture the varying degrees of limitation which occur inconjunction with chronic illnessand impairment. Three dominant methodologies are now in use: the impairment-based type used by the Social Security Administration, work evaluations common to physical and occupational therapy and functional assessment questionnaires used in outcomes research. None meets all of the necessary conceptual criteria. In the absence of improved measurement methods, a core component of health-related quality of life is being overlooked.",

Amick Because most of the available methods for assessing work role functioning either are not specific to work or focus only on the performance of physical work demands, a new 15 item self-report questionnaire was developed. Its purpose was to measure the frequency distribution and sources of work limitations within a national sample of 972 employed adults. This mail questionnaire elicited reports of the degree to which individuals had difficulty during the past four weeks meeting physical, mental, social and environmental work demands. Responses were scaled from 0 ('no difficulty') to 6 ( so much difficulty 'not done at all') and 'does not apply to my job'. Subjects were drawn from a 1994 national follow-up household survey of functional health status. In this employed subsample, 74% reported having one or more chronic or impairing conditions. The instruments met standard psychometric criteria for discriminant and convergent validity, internal homogeneity, item to total correlation and two-week test-retest reliability. The 15 items were classified into three relatively homogenous, mutually exclusive dimensions based on the strength of each item's relationship to SF-36 physical and mental health summary index scores. One, consisting of physically demanding tasks, was related more strongly to physical health. Another, comprised of psycho-social demands, was related principally to mental health. The last included mainly environmental demands and it was related to both health indexes. Subjects were classified as 'limited' on each dimension if they reported some or more difficulty on at least one of the relevant items and as 'not limited' if none or slight difficulty was reported for every item.",

The divergence between individual objective life status and subjective life satisfaction is associated with his/her own aspirations for life, external reference standard of life and personal ability, resources, etc. The multiple regression results show the living condition dimension (income, housing and environment, etc.) is still the highest value indicator of life and has the greatest influence on evaluation of overall QOL.",

Relevant areas and content for the DHP-1 was derived following a series of m-depth interviews with 25 insulin dependent and insulin requiring patients aged 20-65 years, a review of the literature and discussions with health care professionals. The DHP-1 comprising 43 items was completed by 2,239 insulin dependent and insulin requiring patients recruited from 54 hospital outpatient sites throughout England and Wales. Mean age of sample was 39.8 (SD IO) years, range 16-84 years. Fifty-one per cent (n = 1144) were men. According to Cattell's scree test criterion, a forced three factor Principal Factoring Analysis (PAF) with varimax rotation was carried out on the 43 items. Eleven items were excluded from further analysis with item factor cross loadings > 0.30 or item factor loadings < 0.30. A further PAF analysis of the 32 items resulted in three factors accounting for 33% of the total explained variance. The three factors were interpreted as Psychological distress, Barriers to activity and Disinhibited eating.

Congruence between factor structures was assessed using Harman's coefficient of congruence where 1.0 represents total agreement.

These tests will assess neurological outcome along with standard oncology outcomes based on neuroimaging (response rates and time to tumor progression). Glioma patients who recur after primary therapy will be randomized to treatment with the anticancer drug carboplatin, plus either RMP-7 or placebo in a double-blind fashion.

Patients will be monitored for time to tumor progression and changes in the following tests: (1) Changes in the test scores over time will be calculated by a reliable change index, and differences between the two groups (RMP-7 vs. placebo) will be analyzed. In this way it can be determined if RMP-7 has an impact on time to tumor progression and any differential effect on neurobehavioural functioning compared to placebo. Developing a disease-specific quality of life assessment protocol for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) poses a unique set challenges because of the relapsing-remitting nature of this chronic disease, the variety of physical and cognitive symptoms it produces, the lack of definitive therapeutic interventions to manage it and the sociodemographic characteristics of those most commonly affected. The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) represents the efforts of a multi-disciplinary, international research group to develop an inventory of generic and disease-specific measures that is appropriate for both crosssectional and longitudinal assessment. It is expected that the final version of this measure will be available in a variety of formats to allow self-administration and will be sensitive to between-group comparisons as well as changes in disease status. The development approach used to generate the MSQLI has included a variety of techniques so as to assure its utility for researchers and clinicians, the inclusiveness of assessment domains based on patient perception and assurance of psychometric integrity. A theoretical approach was initially adopted to assure comprehensiveness of domains. A nominal group process was used to: (1) delineate the anticipated applications and modes of administration of the instrument; (2) specify the relevant domains of assessment to be included; (3) operationalize those key constructs utilizing generic measures and disease-specific measures which were identified in aggregate as 'candidate measures' (CM). These were reviewed by three expert panels composed of: (1) persons with MS and their family caregivers; (2) allied health professionals and (3) neurologists who were directed to identify any significant domains that were under-assessed or unaddressed and CM was modified in response to that feed-back. This process generated the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) that includes two generic measures, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) as well as disease-specific measures.",

We conclude that clinical research in Africa is feasible and should be encouraged in other areas. It has long been claimed that failure to control nausea and vomiting (NV) after chemotherapy adversely affects QOL, but there is little if any empirical evidence demonstrating that superior anti-emetic control is reflected in better QOL as measured by a validated instrument. In a study comparing dolasetron (dol) to ondansetron (ond) + dexamethasone (dex) 696 patients were randomized in a factorial design to receive one of four regimens (IV do1 f IV dex or IV ond f IV dex) immediately prior to MEC. NV were measured by patient diaries. QOL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ C30+3 administered prior to chemotherapy and on day 4 or 8 after chemotherapy. Overall the administration of dex markedly improved NV both acutely and over the seven days post MEC while the differences between do1 and ond were moderate acutely and disappeared over the post 24 hour period. These differences were reflected in QOL assessments. When changes in QOL scores from baseline were compared in patients receiving or not receiving dex, significant differences in favour of dex were found for: global QOL (p = O.OOOl), physical (p = 0.005) and social (p = 0.001) function and m the symptoms fatigue (p = O.OOOl), pain (p = 0.004), NV (p = O.OOOl), appetite loss (p = O.OOOl), constipation (p = 0.015) and diarrhea (p = 0.007). In the do1 to ond comparison the only significant QOL difference was in the symptom constipation (p = 0.004). Anti-emetic therapy which results in substantial improvement in NV control also produces detectable benefits with respect to broader aspects of QOL. Inst. 1993; 85: 365-76) . The results indicated that reliability coefficients (Cronbach's IX) for multi-item scales ranged from 0.52-0.89. The lowest coefficient was for the two-item role function scale, which was 0.54 before treatment and 0.52 after treatment. On the basis of this result and a re-examination of the wording of the two items, the wording of the items was changed from 'Are you limited in any way in doing either your work or doing household jobs?' and 'Are you completely unable to work at a job or do household jobs?' to 'Were you limited in doing either your work or other daily activities?' and 'Were you limited in pursuing your hobbies or other leisure time activities?' The previous 'No' and 'Yes' response options were changed to a 4-category response format, in keeping with the response format of 'Not at all', 'A little', 'Quite a bit' and 'Very much' used for most of the other items in the QLQ-C30. In addition, a new item 'How would you rate your overall health during the past week?' was added to the global quality of life scale with the intent of replacmg an original item asking for a rating of 'overall physical condition' but retaining an original item asking about 'overall quality o_f life'. This modified questionnaire, termed the QLQ-C30(+3), including the original and new items, was tested in 696 patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses in multicentre studies in Canada and 485 patients at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. In the Canadian studies, Cronbach's alphas for the role function scale varied from 0.59-0.67 over three time points for the original questions with a dichotomous response format and from 0.81 -0.88 for the revised questions with a four-category response format.

In addition, in the NCIC studies, Cronbath's alphas for the physical function scale using the dichotomous response format ('No' and 'Yes') and the fourcategory response format as indicated above) were compared. Alphas for the four-category response format were 0.81-0.84 compared to 0.70-O 76 for the dichotomous response format. The four-category response format is undergoing further field testing. Pending the results of these trials, the current version of the QLQ-C30 (2.0) now incorporates the new role functlon and global quality of life scales Significance of changes in health-related quality of life (QOL) scores in women receiving chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer 468 Qua&y of Life Research Vol 4 1995 indicating 'moderate' or 'very much' change had corresponding mean change scores ranging from 4.1-30.0 on the QLQ-C30. Thus, despite a lack of a high correlation between all of the domains in the SSQ and the corresponding QLQ-C30 domains, the changes in the average QLQ-C30 scores appeared to be meaningful in the expected direction and magnitude. D. Osoba, G. Rodrigues, J. Myles and J. Pater In studies of QOL, it would be desirable to know whether statistically significant numerical changes observed over time or between patients are perceived as being significant to the subjects themselves. However, determining the 'subjective' significance of differences in scores derived from multidimensional QOL instruments may be complicated by the perceived meaning (to the subject) of the wording in the scales. In this study, we assessed whether the perception of change over time in certain QOL domains was accompanied by a corresponding change in the direction and magnitude of the responses in the analogous domains in the EORTC QLQ-C30. The study sample consisted of 154 women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who were receiving chemotherapy with either doxorubicin alone or doxorubicin and vinorelbine every 3 weeks in a phase III trial. All women completed the QLQ-C30 before the first (baseline completion) and third (follow-up completion) cycles of chemotherapy. At follow-up they also completed an additional four-item questionnaire, the subjective significance questionnaire (SSQ), which asked 'Since the last time I filled out the questionnaire, my physzcnl condition/my emotional state/my ability to enloy social life/the overall quality of my life, is: very much worse/moderately worse/a little worse/about the same/a little better/moderately better/very much better'.",

The highest correlations for like domains were for social life and social function (0.46) and for overall QOL and global QOL (0.43). However, the correlation between emotional state and emotional function was 0.32 with a higher correlation between emotional state and global QOL (0.42). Similarly, the correlation between physical condition and physical function was 0.21, while the correlation between physical condition and global QOL was higher (0.48). Thus, the subjects appeared to interpret social life and overall QOL on the SSQ as being similar to social function and global QOL of the QLQ-C30, but interpreted emotional state and physical condition to be similar to global QOL rather than the corresponding domains of the QLQ-C30. When the direction and magnitude of change m the scores between baseline and follow-up were compared between the corresponding domains on the SSQ and the QLQ-C30, there was reasonably good correspondence between the scores. Patients reporting 'no change' on the SSQ had little difference in QLQ-C30 scores (range f3.3-7.2), while those reporting change on the SSQ usually indicated change in the appropriate direction in the QLQ-C30 domains.

Internal consistency (Cronbach's a) ranged from 0.52-0.91.

The building of the instrument relies on Newman's nursing framework of health. Newman considers health as the evolving pattern of the whole of life. Her theory of health involves the concepts of movement, space and time all correlated to consciousness. Two of her theoretical propositions are important in the building of the Auto-Patterning Index (API): (1) time (24 hours) is a function of movement (rhythmic behaviours); and (2) movement is a means by which space and time become a reality. Movement is a fundamental unit of analysis in Newman's theory and implies at the macro level, 11 daily rhythmic behaviours for the present study. Within the Newman perspective human patterning expressed in rhythmic behaviours can be viewed as rhythmic expressions of QOL. The rhythmic behaviours are operationalized by duration, rate and amount. The API is a self-assessment tool which involves 11 daily rhythmic (occurrences of similar behaviours within similar intervals) behaviours (each one measured for frequency and duration). A pilot study involving 11 behaviours (sleeping, eating, drinking, eliminating, working, hygiene, leisure, physical activities, learning activities, personal communications and others) was conducted. The 11 items, consistently appeared in the literature and were chosen based on face validity.",

The relationship between scores obtained on the API and the women's weights (used as a criterion) was analyzed by the stepwise multiple regression procedure (SPSS). The results showed that with 11 variables and ten DF, the R2 = 0.97 and the adj R2 = 0.88. The results obtained were considered promising enough to pursue the validation of the API. A three measurement period study followed with two groups of women (clinic and non-clinic) involving 50 women per group at time one, 31 women per group at time two and time three. These women who signed a written consent were 12-45 pounds overweight at time one and between the ages of 25 and 45. At three points in time, multivariate analyses of variance with an a set at 0.05 were used to identify and measure the relationships between the scores obtained from the API and the women's weights. Results showed that the two groups differed on duration and amount of their daily behaviours at time two and time three of the study. However, the frequency of their behaviours was not statistically significant. The daily behaviours that were dissimilar between the groups were at time two: hygiene, sleep, learning, elimination and eating which were increased for the clinic women. At time three, the significant behaviours were: hygiene, elimination, drinking, sleeping and eating which remained increased for the clinic women who maintained their weight loss. Furthermore, the women who lost weight at time two and maintained their weight loss at time three, showed an increase in their combined behaviours and the summation of the duration of their behaviours in comparison to the non-clinic women. Communicating, working, passive activities, physical activities and 'other behaviours' were non-significant at time two and time three between the groups. Further research is recommended to continue the development and evaluation of the API based on Newman's framework. Nausea and vomiting (NV) after MEC is usually most severe in the first few days after treatment and resolves by the end of one week. In a previous study (J C/in Oncoll994; 12(5): 1050-1057) we found modest correlation between control of NV and QOL measured at day 8. We postulated that, despite the 7 day TF of the questionnaire, patient assessments reflected the most recent days' experience. We therefore developed this study to explore whether administering a QOL questionnaire at different days after MEC and/or with different TF would affect the results reported.",

One version framed questions with reference to the previous three days, while the other version framed questions with reference to the previous seven days. For each patient, results were expressed in terms of change in QOL scores from baseline (CS) for each component of the QLQ C30+3.

Both DA and TF affect patient reports of QOL after MEC. The first is not surprising, given the time course of NV after MEC.

Besides morbidity and mortality, Quality of Life (QOL) is the important outcome parameter following OLT. The purpose of this study was to develop a QL-Index and provide QOL data in liver transplant patients. Between January 1992 and March 1993 a disease specific QL-Index (LSQL) was developed and validated in 347 comparable adult patients with chronic liver disease as well as before and after OLT. Initially, 82 possible relevant items could be reduced to 28 items by analyzing three different sets of questionnaires in 147 patients.

In addition, such a profile enables researchers to identify the dimensions which are mostly affected in subgroups of patients (i.e. social isolation and sleep in IV-drug users). Further studies should assess the prognostic value of NHP scores. Analysis of research published over the past ten years revealed six patterns in quality of life measurements among populations that included cognitively impaired adults. The patterns were: limited conceptualization of quality of life; reliance on proxies; exclusion of all cognitively impaired subjects; inclusion of data contributed by cognitively impaired sublects without verifying comprehension; inability to determine clinically significant change; and limited psychometric support for potentially useful measures. Preliminary observations are reported from two current studies involving adults who have some cognitive impairment associated with brain injury, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia or severe obstructive sleep apnea, and cognitively normal proxies. Measures being used include the Sickness Impact Profile and SF-36. Four patterns are emerging: low tolerance for ambiguity; literal interpretation; importance of validity; and differences in how life is experienced. Recognition of these patterns raises questions about attention and comprehension of cognitively normal subjects who appear to ignore ambiguity, make interpretations at varying levels of abstractness and refrain from commenting on what they consider irrelevant. It is argued also that the importance ascribed to how life is experienced is the barometer by which quality of life data in populations including cognitive impaired adults should be interpreted.",

The average age of patients was 65; 60% were female. All patients were asked to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, with help if required. The baseline questionnaire was completed within 3 days of diagnosis, the first follow-up within 7 days of baseline, the second and third follow-up at 28 day intervals and the fourth follow-up at a further interval of 3 months. In general, patients complied well with completing the questionnaire. The performance of the questionnaire was consistent with known data on its use with other patients with advanced cancer. Observing trends in the data showed that patients who go on to complete the next follow-up have slightly better than average scores, whilst patients who either die or leave the setting at the next follow-up have worse scores. Although these differences are small they are consistent for the functioning, symptom and global quality of life scores. Significant improvements in symptoms scores between baseline and first follow-up are observed. Patients without carers report significantly better functioning and global quality of life scores compared to those with carers, although this is not true of symptom scores. The use of self reporting quality of life questionnaires as a means of assessing palliative care patients appears to be a vaiid approach.

Defenders of the HYE as different allege that those who argue the equivalence do not appreciate the important differences in measurement of preferences under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. The HYE is alleged to measure preferences under conditions of uncertainty whereas the TTO does not. The resulting ambiguity in the literature is resolved in this work where the equivalence of these methods is proven. The HYE in its two-stage process does in fact inject and then subsequently remove the aspect of uncertainty from the assessment process, making it, at best, a cumbersome equivalent to the TTO.

Cochlear implants are devices used to provide the sensation of sound to those who are profoundly deaf, but unable to benefit from conventional hearing aids. While many believe that these devices represent a tremendous benefit to the recipient, only one large trial has specifically examined quality of life after receipt of a cochlear implant. As part of the planning for a study of the QOL and economic outcomes associated with cochlear implantation, we developed a disease specific scale designed to detect the improvement in QOL after cochlear implantation. We followed established procedures for the development of a disease specific measure of QOL. We first reviewed the limited information on QOL for this population and the scales currently available; however, none covered the relevant dimensions of QOL in sufficient detail to detect expected differences due to cochlear implantation. Two scales were developed: the Hearing Quality of Life (H-QOL) scale and the Hearing Work (HW) scale. Items for each of the scales were developed through review of literature on QOL in hearing impaired persons, review of existing scales, interviews with persons with profound hearing loss who had received cochlear implants, and focus groups with persons with severe to profound hearing loss who had not received an implant. Cognitive interviews were conducted with profoundly hearing impaired persons to detect difficulties in understanding items and instructions. Revisions were made based on these interviews. A pilot study was conducted in which a questionnaire including the new scales as well as other QOL scales selected for the trial were mailed to 350 persons who had received a cochlear implant and 60 persons who were eligible for, but who had not received an implant (86%and 52% of implantees and non implantees respectively, returned usable questionnaires).

The motivation comes from three directions: locally common diseases which merit study; diseases which are rare in one setting, but common elsewhere, such that experience gained in another culture may be transferable; and large scale trans-cultural studies. Two important questions arise. Is there an efficient reliable approach to language translation? Are the underlying constructs in quality of life measures cross-culturally valid? To begin to answer these questions the WHO Collaborating Centre for Quality of Life in Cancer Care has undertaken two studies, one in Singapore (a mixed Chinese/Malay/ English society), and one in Zimbabwe (English/Shona). In both studies the Functional Living Index for Cancer (FLIC) was translated by a three stage process including translation/backtranslation; focus group pilot testing; and formal testing on a suitable cancer population.",

In both Singapore and Zimbabwe the factor analyses obtained were very similar to those obtained during development of the FLIC in English. This suggests that the quality of life construct may be cross-culturally robust. However, there are important differences in both language and cultural nuance which must be recognized and accommodated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of patients' self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores to adverse events (AEs) reported during clinical trials. To be effective measures for research and clinical practice, QOL self-assessment questionnaires must be sensitive to the impact of health problems, such as drug toxicities, symptoms and disease progression on patient functioning and well-being. While other factors beyond clinical AEs are important, the recent occurrence of AEs relevant to a particular QOL dimension should affect its score.",

Comorbid anxiety disorder had an additional negative impact on HRQOL for medically ill patients, especially those with hypertension or diabetes.

We investigated the manner in which patients distinguish health status and QOL in their subjective assessments of these two constructs.

In employing self-report quality of life (QOL) measures, it is assumed that the individuals under study have an internalized standard for judging their current level of QOL, and that this internalized standard will remain stable over time. However there is evidence to suggest that cancer patients' internal standards for assessing their QOL may not be as stable as has been assumed. Such shifting of internal standards (termed 'response shift') may jeopardize the validity of results of studies employing longitudinal designs. The use of a retrospective pretest as an extension of the conventional pretest-posttest design has been proposed as a means of avoiding such response shift bias. At the retrospective pretest patients are asked to provide a renewed judgement about their pretest level of QOL. The use of such a retrospective pretest was found to be feasible in an earlier study with 26 cancer patients. The primary aims of the current study are: (1) to determine the extent to which cancer patients experience a response shift as a result of their oncologic treatment; and (2) to determine whether posttest minus retrospective pretest difference scores yield more valid results than posttest minus conventional pretest difference scores.",

Criterion measures included: (1) an interview to establish the patients' level of performance status, which was held at both assessments; and (2) a questionnaire on reported change with respect to a range of QOL domains since the start of radiotherapy, administered at the post-treatment session. Contrary to expectation, no evidence for response-shift effects was found for those patients whose health status deteriorated over time. However, response shift effects were found in the area of fatigue, as assessed by the MFI-20, for those patients who reported a stable or improved health status over time. For these patients, the mean fatigue level of the retrospective pretest was significantly higher than that of the conventional pretest, with higher scores indicating a higher level of fatigue (repeated measures ANOVA; p < 0.01). For the entire sample, posttest minus retrospective pretest difference scores were more valid than posttest minus conventional pretest difference scores in that they generally yielded higher correlation coefficients with criterion measures of change. The methodological implications of these fndings for assessing QOL over time will be discussed. Although no significant differences were observed between healthy controls and burned individuals, the correlation analysis revealed that burn severity (%TBSA) affected specific quality of life domains. Indeed, the more severe the injury, the lower the score for physical functioning (r = -0.37, p < 0.03), role physical (r = -0.30, p = 0.06), vitality (T = -0.34 p < 0.05) and role emotional (r = -0.43, p < 0.01).

Is it feasible? How reliable? Why more than one question to measure their health? This abstract was prepared pursuant to the IQOLA Project. The study sample comprised a cohort of 92 year old men and women within the well-established longitudinal population study of health, disease and quality of life in the elderly in Giiteborg (H70). A validated translation of the SF-36 through the IQOLA Project was included in the broad arsenal of examination techniques. The representative sample examined involved 375 subjects in total, 223 of these being eligible for one or more examinations (60%). One hundred sixteen (52%) were able to complete the SF-36, introduced by a nurse during her home visit. Most subjects needed some personal assistance in responding to the standardized instrument. Most frequent dropout reason was psychiatric and/or somatic morbidity. This evaluation includes the eight subscales of the SF-36, transformed into a O-100 scale, and the physical and mental summary scores expressed as T-scores with mean 50 and SD 10. Values from a cohort of 544 70 year olds (60% women) within the H-70 study and selected age groups within the normative database (n = 8930) were used for comparison. A sample of multitrait analysis results, based on 85 subjects (73%) passing the half-scale criterion (68% women), showed high completion rate over most items, good variability of scale scores (low floor effect except the role functioning scales: low ceiling effect), acceptable iteminternal consistency (Cronbach's a 0.73-0.93) except the social functioning scale (0.58), acceptable item-discriminant validity for all functioning scales except social functioning, and only moderate distinction between the three well-being scales indicating more overlap between general health, vitality and mental health than in persons below75. Health profiles showed selective differences by age confirming the relevance of a multidimensional measure (see figure) . Physical health decreased more than mental health (summary scores declined from T-scores 45 to 35 and from 50 to 46, respectively). We conclude that informative self-report health data could be provided from at least half of this very old cohort. The CARES-SF is a quality of life questionnaire designed for use with cancer patients. This instrument generates five summary scale scores (PHYsical, PSYchosocial, MEDical Interaction, MARital, SEXual) and a TOTal score. To date few data on its psychometric performance, when used on its own (i.e. not as part of the 139-item CARES), are available. In this study the feasibility, psychometric performance and clinical validity of the CARES-SF for assessing healthrelated quality of life in clinical trials were investigated. A longitudinal design with a heterogeneous patient sample, stratified by diagnosis and stage of disease, was used.",

The data is from an epidemiologically-led survey of health care needs following stroke, undertaken in 1993 in a northern region of the UK. Four hundred and fifteen persons reported that they had a stroke where the symptoms had lasted more than 24 hours, with mean age 71 years and mean duration since their last stroke, 6 years. The pain data fit the Rasch model very well. Items of the pain subscale are adequately distributed along the underlying pain continuum (latent trait), as expressed by the logit score. The standardized infit statistic, distributed approximately to the distribution, shows an absence of items below the 1% level, confirming the unidimensionality of the pain scale. An examination of the relationship between the Rasch measure and the raw score demonstrates that the raw score-a simple count or percentage-not the weights used in the UK-can for all practical purposes be considered as an interval level measure. and item selection.

Thus the INRR was seen to increase significantly with age (F = 6.88; p < 0.05). Highest INRR was observed for those items associated with the physical-and emotional role scales. INRR reached 21% amongst 75+ years olds for two items in the latter, compared to an average 2.8% INRR amongst the same age group for the two items in the Bodily Pain scale.",

Also these findings raise several issues related to the SQOL concept and its measurement.

Based upon the findings from these data, a cost-efficiency model was developed to determine the incremental cost of finding an additional true adverse event. The model involved three steps: (1) initial flagging; (2) clinical exam review; and (3) confirmatory exam and/or laboratory review. Three models were developed assuming a sensitivity for current AE methods of 0.99, 0.88 and 0.69 respectively and the costs for monitoring, investigator, administrative time and laboratory charges were fixed at $75/hr, $200/hr, $30/hr and $25 respectively.",

Citing the high sensitivity and specificity of the physician checklist method, possible savings associated with implementing diagnostic verification as part of the exam, substantially reduced costs as compared to the QOL methods, and the ability to maintain blinded quality of life assessment, we recommend a modified version of the physician checklist for sponsors who desire the kind of safety-related information that quality of life reports can provide. care towards community care has demonstrated the diverse needs of people with long-term mental illness. To live and to survive in the community, most of them need comprehensive programmes including different forms of psychiatric care, social and rehabilitation services. The organization and implementation of these community programmes have been shown to be difficult and proved to be even more difficult to evaluate. Not the least because of the highly complex multi-dimensional measurements. These measures should aim to regard the patients themselves as the most important source of information and, in that respect, quality of life is a promising concept. Still, two questions have to be answered: (1) what do we know about the quality of the instruments for patients with severe mental illness; and (2) how can we rule out cross-cultural differences when using an instrument from another country? To answer these questions, we have used a top-down and bottom-up method.

Very similar patterns of scale-factor correlations were observed in each of the seven countries, as well as in an 'international' components analysis that combined all data with sampling weights that gave equal weight to each country Correlations between scales and the physical and mental components in the 'international' solution were nearly identical to those published for the USA general population, despite the fact that the USA respondents accounted for one-seventh of the combined international sample.

Physical and mental component summary scores computed using weights from the 'international' factor analysis proved to be interchangeable with those based on country-specific weights. We draw four conclusions from these results: (1) the great majority (80%+) of the reliable variance in SF-36 scales can be summarized using two physical and mental health scales in all seven countries studied to date; (2) five of the eight SF-36 scales have very similar factor content and, therefore, can be expected to have very similar interpretations across these seven general populations;",

For the analysis of the data subscores have been calculated according to the standardized dimensional structure of the questionnaires. For descriptive analysis arithmetic means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients have been computed. A cluster analysis using the centroid method has been performed to define subgroups of patients with a special pattern of quality of life aspects. The mean values of all subscales show no clear differences between the patients of the four clinics. Patients in medical facilities using complementary methods judge their quality of life quite similar to patient groups treated with conventional methods. The main impairment is represented by the somatic factors of quality of life. Functioning in everyday or social life is less affected by the disease. On the other hand, a group of patients treated in a department of conventional internal medicine shows a higher degree of satisfaction with somatic as well as psychological aspects. The subscales of the questionnaires show clear correlations with corresponding dimensions (r = 0.60-0.80). The cluster analysis suggests a three-cluster solution which allows a characterization of different types of patients with respect to their quality of life. Population health surveys in the United States and Canada have included a question on the self-rating of health. We reviewed the responses to the question and have found that the distributions of scores are consistent over time within the USA and Canadian surveys, but that the distributions were consistently lower in Canada than the USA.

Following a stroke, the ultimate goal of the rehabilitation process is to return the individual to a pattern of living that approximates, as closely as possible, the one that was led prior to the event. This is accomplished, at least in theory, by attempting to reduce the effect of impairment on disability and by preventing the onset of handicap. In this paper we present the health-related quality of life of 214 individuals with stroke who were assessed 1-5 years following discharge home from an in-patient rehabilitation setting. While in the rehabilitation hospital, these clients received, on a daily weekday basis, some or all of the following therapies: occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy as well as routine rehabilitative nursing care. Much emphasis was placed on regaining motor control, mobility and functional skills required for daily living. The average length of time spent in the programme was about 70 days, and this was preceded by an acute care stay of approximately 40 days. To determine health-related quality of life we conducted an in-person interview in the subject's home. The Reintegration to Normal Living Index, as a proxy for health-related quality of life, was used to identify the extent of community reintegration.",

Similarly, 86% responded yes to 'are you comfortable with how your self-care needs are met?' In sharp contrast, only 39% reported that most of their days were spent in an activity that was necessary or important to them. Fewer than half reported that they were 'unable to participate in recreational activities as they would have wanted to', even activities such as television viewing, hobbies, crafts, reading and games. Only 54% indicated that they were satisfied with their participation in social activities. Interestingly, more individuals reported being able 'to take trips out of town as they felt was necessary' (51%) then being able 'to move around their community' (42%). The findings of this study suggest that individuals with stroke who return home following rehabilitation may be well prepared to achieve the basic tasks of daily life but are less able to achieve those activities that enhance daily Absfmcfs of the Confribufed Papers used with initial group assignment and dimension of health status both as fixed effects, and person as a random effect.",

Some well known instruments summarize various domains into a summary HRQOL measure using an aggregate score and treat this as an indication of patient's overall quality of life. However, this approach to measuring overall HRQOL may not be sensitive to individual differences in attitudes toward the importance of various psychosocial and functional domains. For example, a randomized study on psychosocial adjustment comparing lumpectomy vs. mastectomy suggested that overall HRQOL was not affected by treatment even though individual psychosocial domains were different between the two groups. Another approach is to use a multidimensional instrument which includes a direct assessment of global HRQOL. This method does not assume that all dimensions are equal in their contribution to an overall HRQOL score. Adirect assessment of global HRQOL is therefore a separate construct.",

Patients who vomited had a significantly lower DA-HRQOL change scores compared to those who had no vomiting (-13.8 vs. -4.4 ). Among the five functional domains, vomiting only affected cognitive function (p = 0 < O.OOl), this may be the result of using prochlorperazine in an effort to control vomiting. The correlations between each of the five functional domains with DA-HRQOL (0.26-0.40) were significantly lower than the corresponding correlations with AV-HRQOL and PC-HRQOL (0.56-0.71) when we examined the relationship between functional domains and different global HRQOL measures. This result supports the premise that DA-HRQOL is a separate construct which may not be fully captured by the functional domains of the questionnaire.

Kaplan University of California, San Diego, CA, USAMeasures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) attempt to quantify risks and benefits of health care. Two approaches to HRQOL assessment are classified as profile and utility based methods. Profile methods have their theoretical roots in psychometrics while utility methods are derived from statistical decision and mircoeconomic theories. One HRQOL measure, the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), is criticized because it does not provide separate mental and physical health dimensions. However, the QWB does include extensive lists of physical and mental health symptoms. This study used factor analysis of the symptom/ complex scores of the QWB on a heterogeneous sample of patients. Original data from four groups were analyzed: patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n = 425), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 109), diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 412) and affective disorders (AD) (n = 172). If symptoms grouped into factors (physical health, mental health), QWB 'profiies' might be created.Instead, symptoms loaded on 'malaise' factors across diseases, which were validated against other outcome measures in each group. For each patient group, the first For dichotomous variables, t-tests were used for the comparison of group means. In patients with HIV, significant linear relationships were seen in CD4 cells (p < 0.01) BeckDepressionInventory(p < O.Ol),CSFB2Microglobulin (p < O.Ol),andKarnofskyPerformanceIndex(p < O.Ol),among others. In COPD, there were significant linear trends for Perceived Breathlessness (p < 0.05) and Self-Efficacy for Walking (p < 0.05). In DM, significant relationships included age (p < O.Ol),hypoglycemicagentuse@ < O.Ol),durationsince QOL, and within two days they were interviewed with SG and TTO. Three patients were excluded for lack of comprehension during the interview. The resulting utility values differ considerably between the measures, both with regard to central tendency and dispersion:Agreement between the different measures can be expressed as the mean difference of the scores fl.96 standard error, giving the 95% confidence interval:Utility measures are conceptually attractive, but raise many practical problems. The utility scores in our study were sensitive to the choice of instrument, which is of crucial importance for cost-utility studies. Thedifference might become smaller by proper scaling and adjustment of the measures. More work needs to be done on the development of rational utility measures.

            "text": "Abstracts of the Gmtributed Papers Current clinical research in neurological diseases relies on outcomes methods which may not be sensitive to the types of changes influenced by pharmacologic and rehabilitation interventions.The Extended Q-TWiST method was developed to provide a patient-centreed outcomes method which integrates the perspectives of the patient, the provider and the payor in a single analysis. This method requires: (1) reliable, valid, and responsive measures; and (2) meaningful ways of assessing importance which balance the subjective and objective components. The purpose of this study was to validate two new measures of neurological function for use in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical research, and to validate a new approach to patient preference assessment that highlights the individual's personal priorities. This multi-site study (n = 300) involved 13 MS centres from around the USA and Canada. The new scales being validated were the Symptom Inventory (SI), a 99-item measure of impairment; and the Performance Scales (PS), a disability measure which represents eight different functional domains. Eligible patients with definite MS were given a neurological examination which included the EDSS, Disease Steps, and the Ambulation Index. Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire packet at home and return it by mail. Retest packets were completed within two weeks later. Participants tended to be middle aged people who had some college education and were moderately disabled. All participants were asked to complete the SI, the PS, the Health Status Questionnaire, the Quality of Well-Being Index and three approaches for utility assessment (global rating scale, time trade-off and idiographic domain-specific importance ratings). Psychometric analyses evaluated the reliability and validity of the SI and PS. Results revealed that both the SI and PS are reliable and valid scales. Both tools showed high test-retest reliability (r = 0.90 and 0.80, respectively).The internal consistency reliability of the SI ranged from 0.65-0.90, and item-total correlations were used to determine which items could be dropped from the measure without sacrificing reliability. Both measures demonstrated construct, convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity. Analyses of the utility approaches supported the use of the global rating scale and the idiographic approach, but not the time trade-off approach. The application of the new measures to Q-TWiST evaluations will be discussed. To discount chance agreements, we also calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between patient and proxy ratings. Presence of systematic bias was evaluated by calculating mean difference scores between patient and proxy ratings. To examine the magnitude of any observed bias, the mean difference score was standardized by calculating the effect size (d) for paired observations. The association between patient-proxy agreement and characteristics of patients' physical and neurological status and proxies' background was examined by relating these characteristics to the number of discrepancies for each patient-proxy pair over all questions.Approximately 60% of the patient and proxy scores were in exact agreement, with more than 90% of scores being within one response category of each other. For most HRQOL dimensions assessed, moderate to good agreement was found (ICC = 0.48-0.74). Statistically significant differences in mean scores were noted for several HRQOL dimensions, with proxies tending to rate the patients as having a lower level of quality of life than did the patients themselves. However, with the exception of fatigue ratings (d = 0.56), this response bias was of a limited magnitude (d = O.OO-0.38). Less agreement and a more pronounced response bias was observed for the more neurologically impaired patients, and particularly for patients exhibiting mental confusion.This finding was confirmed by longitudinal analyses which indicated lower levels of patient-proxy agreement at follow-up for those patients whose neurological and physical status had deteriorated over time. In general, patients and their significant others provide similar ratings of the patients' quality of life. Lower levels of agreement and more biased ratings can be expected among those patients for whom the need for proxies is most salient. It is argued, however, that discrepancies between patient-proxy ratings should not be interpreted, a priori, as evidence of the inaccuracy or biased nature of proxy-generated data. Future studies are needed to examine the relative validity and reliability of patient-vs. proxygenerated HRQOL scores. The objectives of this study were: (1) to construct a breast cancer-specific questionnaire module to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30;and (2) to test the psychometric, clinical and cross-cultural validity and reliability of this module in three countries, i.e. the Netherlands (NL), Spain (SP), and the United States (USA). Module construction took place following the Study Group's guidelines for module development.The module consists of 23 items covering symptoms and side-effects related to different treatment modalities, future perspective, body image, and sexuality. The five hypothesized scales include: body image, sexual functioning, systemic therapy side-effects, arm symptoms and breast symptoms. This module was tested in 170 Dutch, 163 Spanish, and 158 American cancer patients at two points in time. The timing for the Dutch and Spanish patients was prior to treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy and during treatment. For the American patients, the questionnaire was administered at admission at the breast clinic and 4 months following the first assessment. Sociodemographic and clinical data were extracted from patients' medical records.On the basis of multitrait scaling analysis, consistent evidence for item convergent and item discriminant validity was found for the body image and sexual functioning scales (NL/SP/USA).The scales that evidenced consistent problems were those on arm and breast symptoms (SP) and on systemic therapy side effects (NL/SP). Consistent support for the module's scale structure was found in the USA sample. Cronbach's a coefficients were, in general, lowest in Spain (range: 0.46-0.94) and highest in the USA (range: 0.70-0.91). On the basis of known-groups comparisons, significant differences (p < 0.01) in pre-treatment scores as a function of disease stage were observed in sexual functioning (NL), future perspective (NL) and systemic therapy side effects (NL/SP). These differences were in the expected direction.None of these differences achieved statistical significance in the USA sample. According to expectation, patients who had undergone mastectomy reported significantly lower levels of body image than patients who had undergone breast conserving surgery (NL/SP, USA data not available). When treatment was used as the grouping variable for the second administration, patients receiving radiotherapy reported a significantly higher level of breast symptoms (NL/SP), while patients receiving chemotherapy reported a significantly higher level of systemic therapy side effects (NL/SP/USA). Repeated measures ANOVA detected significant changes from the first to the second assessment in the expected direction (p < 0.01) in: body image (SP/USA), future perspective (NL/USA), arm symptoms (NL/SP), breast symptoms (NL) and systemic therapy side effects Abstracts of the Contributed Papers at work or school and time needed for home treatment were recorded. Besides that, patients described their own perception of their health status. Health status was compared to quality of life with non parametric correlation. Disease specific complications were correlated using multiple regression analysis.Quality of life as measured with this instrument is not significantly impaired compared to healthy volunteers. There is no correlation to various parameters measuring severity of disease as lung function, nutritional status or Shwachman score. Additional complications like gallstones, liver cirrhosis or insulin dependent diabetes do not have a negative effect on QOL. Yet regarding the patients' own perception of their health status, which may differ significantly from the experts scores, we find a significant influence on quality of life. Differences between East and West were not reflected in the results of the QOL questionnaire (overall as well as subscales as tested with Scheffe).As we learn that self concept and health belief are important variables for QOL in chronically ill patients, it seems necessary to focus more on psychosocial issues in the health services. Especially families who are freshly confronted with the diagnosis have to be supported in dealing with the manyfold challenges of the disease. On the other hand it has to be discussed whether these results reflect a good adaptation to the disease, a high degree of functioning according to social desirability or if this instrument is not specific enough to reflect the real impairment through this very complex disease. diagnosis (p < 0.01) and height (p < 0.01). In AD, significant relationships included Beck and Hamilton Depression Inventories (ps < O.Ol), physical exam for abdomen (p < O.Ol), breathing problems (p < O.Ol), chest (p < O.Ol), headache (p < 0.05), and exercise (p < 0.01). Finally, a confirmatory factor analysis for a combined data set of patients with HIV, DM and AD was performed. Together symptoms loaded on similar factors, and were validated by similar correlations in each of the separate data sets. (Patients with COPD were not used in the final data analysis because the data, obtained from an earlier version of the QWB, did not contain all of the symptoms used in the other three populations.) These results emphasize the possible importance of subjective patient symptom reports as outcome measures in several diverse illness groups. In addition, these findings question the previously held concept of distinct mental and physical health constructs in HRQOL. Specifically, the findings challenge the belief that the depression commonly observed in chronic disease has a separate pathological base.Is quality of life influenced by severity of disease-results of a study in cystic fibrosis patients Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians. A few decades ago CF patients died in childhood, today more than 30% of the patients are adults. This improvement in life expectancy could be achieved through an extensive treatment, consisting of physiotherapy, high caloric nutrition and a complex medication. With increasing life expectancy, treatment goals go beyond improving physical functioning. Adaptation to life with a chronic progressive disease and ability for selfmanagement become increasingly important. This study is part of a public health research project to evaluate the effects of a patient education programme for CF patients and their families.For the first cross sectional study 210 CF patients and their families have been recruited from four German CF centres (two in the East and two in the West, representing nearly 5% of the German CF-patients). Clinical and sociodemographic data were listed. All adolescent and adult patients as well as the parents of the younger patients were investigated with a German QOL questionnaire by M. Bullinger (Alltagsleben).Severity of illness was assessed using lung-function, body mass index and Shwachman score. A number of specific and general measures are available for the assessment of overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in epilepsy. The ideal instrument provides comprehensive assessment of important domains, at the same time aggregating the information into an overall score. If scaled properly, such a scale can be used for cost-utility studies. This study compares four methods for measuring HRQOL on a scale from 0 (death or a condition worse than death) to 1 (complete health): time trade-off (TTO), standard gamble (SG), a 15-dimensional questionnaire based additive model (15D) and a visual analog scale (EuroQOL).All patients aged 18-67 years, who had been admitted to the hospital or attended the outpatient clinic for epilepsy during the last 7 years, received a comprehensive questionnaire. From the respondents to this questionnaire, 67 patients were randomly selected for this study. Most patients had well-controlled epilepsy, but were still on antiepileptic medication.Mean age was 44 years, 41% were male and 59% were female. The patients responded to a self-administered questionnaire including 15D and Euro-surgery. This common condition still carries a high mortality of approximately 60% (Thorax, 1994; 49: 596-597 ) and treatment requires maximal use of ICU resources over prolonged periods. Despite considerable progress in medical management during recent years, little is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of long term survivors of ARDS. Intensive care treatment can be extremely stressful and anxiety, disorientation and agitation can often be observed in ICU patients. Theoretically, this could result in long-lasting adverse effects on emotional well being. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome that occurs in some individuals (e.g. war veterans or victims of domestic violence) after exposure to extreme stress. Patients with PTSD have a high incidence of depression, suicide attempts and substance abuse. This longitudinal study was designed to assess the HRQOL of patients after prolonged ICU treatment for severe ARDS, to delineate the incidence of PTSD in such patients and to test the hypothesis, that the occurrence of PTSD has adverse effects on patient perception of their quality of life.After Institutional Review Board approval, all patients treated at our ICU for ARDS (defined according to the criteria of the American-EuropeanConsensus Conference on ARDS [Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 1994; 149: 818-8241) between 1985 and 1992 were identified using a computerized documentation system and hospital records. Exclusion criteria were: neurological disease, a history of cerebral trauma or surgery and age < 18 years. After identification and initial contact by phone, patients were mailed and filled out the German versions of the SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire and the PTSS 10 Inventory (Acta Psychiafr Scund, 1989; Supp1353, Vol 80), a self-report scale based on the DSM-III-criteria for PTSD. The study protocol included three age and sex comparable control groups: (1) patients after maxillofacial surgery (including tumor patients) (n = 44);(2) volunteers from a sample of military health professionals never exposed to combat (n = 50); (3) UN soldiers after prolonged service in Cambodia (n = 236); and (4) one age and sex matched control group (n = 120) drawn from a large data base (n = 3,000) used to provide standard values for the SF-36 in a German population.One hundred and fourty-four ARDS patients were originally identified.Duration of ICU treatment ranged from 1-214 days (mean 31.8 days). ICU mortality in the whole sample was 42.4% (61 patients). Sixteen from 83 ICU survivors were lost to follow up. An additional 16 of the There was a small but significant impairment in eight of nine health dimensions of the SF-36 in survivors of ARDS when compared to controls (control group 4, fig). All patients were ambulatory and independent, 29 patients (71%) were actively working in the same profession they held before ICU treatment. The overall incidence of PTSD (PISS-10 score > 36) in ARDS patients was 23%, 11.9% in control group one and < 0.5% in control groups two and three (&-square test, p = 0.0000). Patients with PTSD scored signifi cantly lower in all health dimensions of the SF-36 except Social Functioning (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.024).Despite impairments in HRQOL, the majority of patients from this sample of extremely sick ICU patients are able to lead an independent life and show good physical and social functioning.Patients after prolonged exposure to ICU environment and procedures show a high incidence of persistent psychological alterations. Whether this is due to traumatic experiences and awareness during ICU treatment or to factors leading to the disease process itself remains to be determined. The study hypothesis was supported and a significant association demonstrated linking the occurrence of PTSD symptoms to loss of HRQOL. Our findings give evidence of the need to identify and provide therapeutic support for patients with PTSD after prolonged ICU treatment. The primary purpose of this presentation is to overview the public health issues that are emerging for survivors of traumatic brain injury and their families. Particular emphasis will be given to the compromised quality of life issues that often accompany post-injury adjustment. A secondary purpose of this presentation is to discuss an innovative model of rehabilitation for survivors-the 'Clubhouse.' The purpose of a 'Clubhouse' is to provide a centre for socialization which includes educational, recreational and work activities. The philosophy of the 'Clubhouse' is to enhance personal empowerment and self-esteem through individual and community involvement. Discussion will centre on how 'Clubhouses' differ from traditional day treatment and rehabilitation models. Lastly, this presentation will describe four steps necessary to establish a free-standing 'Clubhouse' Programme; these are: community needs assessment, focus groups, pre-programme committee work and fund raising. Limitations with this approach will also be discussed. Research indicates that 9.75 million people in the United States sustain some form of head injury each year; one quarter of these injuries result in long lasting and often permanent alterations in cognitive, emotional and behavioural functioning.Survival rates have increased, in part, due to the recent advances in medical and trauma care thus creating a rehabilitation need unprecedented in public health care systems. Additionally, the psychosocial support needs of people with traumatic brain injury are as great as those for people with chronic mental illness, yet few programmes exist that provide services (e.g., peer support services, recreational activities and open-ended socialization opportunities) for this dual need population. Common problems reported by survivors and their family members are impaired social relations, feelings of estrangement and isolation, and difficulty accepting physical health and lifestyle changes. This underscores the need for adults with head injury to have available appropriate resources that will contribute to their social, emotional and physical quality of life. 'Clubhouse' programmes are one such resource. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss how clinicians can use qualitative and quantitative date to understand what constitutes good quality of life and satisfaction with services from the client/consumer perspective. Crossnational survey data from four countries (e.g., Canada, Cuba, Mexico and the United States) will illustrate these techniques. The benefits and limitations of this evaluation method will be discussed.Increasingly, health and mental health providers are attempting to assess clients/consumers quality of life and satisfaction with services. In doing so, there exists an opportunity for clinicians and clients to work in partnership to address social and contextual issues that goes beyond research-driven indices. As an indices of whether these service areas have been met, clinicians are turning to standardized measurement tools to evaluate their treatment outcomes, namely Quality of Life and Service Satisfaction surveys. Recipients of these services (clients/consumers and their families), however, are seldom consulted about what they want or what is working in their lives. As a result, survey results may provide statistically useful information but may not represent the contextual reality of the clients' lives.In order to illustrate how clinicians and clients can collaborate on assessing the efficacy of the mental health care system, the authors will present date results from a cross-national survey conducted in four different countries between 1992-95. Participants (n = 121) were all outpatients at community based (mental) health care clinics; each had a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and had been actively involved in a local health care system. Significant variables which contributed to perceived satisfaction included living situation and finances (p < 0.05) and leisure activities (p < 0.10). Quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection.The benefits and obstacles to this sort of assessment procedure, particularly from a cross-national perspective, will be discussed. Recommendations will be offered regarding how to maximize client/consumer participation in data gathering procedures and application of the results. affective responses, to create five &item HRQOL scales (item scores: 1 = no health problem; 2 = health problem, but no negative affective response to it; 3 = health problem with a negative affective response). Psychometric performance was evaluated in three ways. First, to estimate homogeneity, Cronbach's a for the five &item HRQOL-scales were calculated. In addition, Cronbath's a were calculated for the two overall emotional functioning scales. Second, for each item, corrected itemscale correlations were calculated and compared to correlations of each item with all other scales. Finally, a confirmative factor analysis was performed. Cronbach's a for the seven scales were: basic physical functioning (0.70), gross motor functioning (0.80), role functioning (0.85), cognitive functioning (0.88), social functioning (0.76), positive moods (0.88) and negative moods (0.77). The correlation of any item with its own scale was always higher than with any other scale in the questionnaire. In a factor analysis, the fit of a five-factor solution to the 40 HRQOL items was very good. The definition of HRQOL as health status combined with affective responses to problems in health status led to promising results. The psychometric performance of the Dutch HRQOL measure for children was quite satisfactory. As a further step in the development of the measure, norms for the measure, as well as data on convergent validity involving a translated version of the German KINDL (Bullinger et al., 1994) , will be collected in a large sample study (n = 1200) in the general child population. In lack of curative therapy for the HIV-infection in the near future, the development and improvement of palliative care gets all the more important. In this context not only clinical parameters (like T cell counts) are relevant, but especially the patients subjective well-being must be considered. For this purpose the recently emerged concept of multidimensional Quality of Life (QOL) assessment, which has been successfully applied in a number of chronic diseases (e.g. hypertonia, epilepsy etc.) offers the appropriate tools for evaluating the effectiveness of drug therapy. As cognitive and neurological impairment is frequently seen already in the earlier stages of HIV-infection and appears even to be a predictor for disease aggravation, the inclusion of tests for mental competence in the concept of QOL assessment in a broader sense seems necessary for this condition. Early diagnosis of these kind of impairments also offers better perspectives for rehabilitation or disease management. Therefore, a neuropsychological test battery measuring complex cognitive as well as elementary brain functions has been included in the study while health-related QOL in a constricted sense is assessed with generic and diseasespecific questionnaires.",

As a disease-specific questionnaire the recently translated and validated German version of the MOS-HIV (Medical Outcome Study for HIV Infection) had been selected including the HIV-specific symptom list. For the assessment of complex cognitive functioning the following tests were administered: a multiple choice lexical intelligence test, the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), digit span and digit symbol tests (from the HAWIE-R), the trail making test B, the grooved pegboard and the Stroop test (colour-word interference). Two basic psychophysical paradigms addressing elementary brain functions were used to investigate the hypothesis of underlying declaration of central temporal processing. They contained the measurement of auditory and visual simple and choice reaction times as well as three finger tapping tests measuring maximal tempo, personal tempo and sensorimotor synchronization.One hundred and ninety-two patients with symptomatic HIV-infection and T4 lymphocyte counts in the range of 0-9OO/ul took part in the study and underwent initial assessment. No more than 2 weeks later (to) each of them was assigned randomly to one of two equally sized treatment groups receiving either Peptide-T or placebo during the following 8 weeks (t8) of treatment phase.

To determine if the QOL-MED was comprehensive and intelligible, it was administered to twelve men in the USA and twenty men in England.For psychometric testing, the QOL-MED was administered twice over two weeks. In both the USA (n = 40) and the UK (n = 29), participants completed PGWB; USA participants also completed the SF-36. By removing items with decreasingly troublesome psychometric characteristics, three possible measures were identified: an l&item, 14item, and IO-item version. These three versions were compared with respect to internal consistency reliability, validity and reproducibility.All three met acceptable criteria, however, we were unable to identify the most suitable version for clinical trials due to important differences in the USA and UK samples. Our objective was to develop a self-report quality of life measure specific to urinary incontinence (I-QOL) that could be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials and in patient care centres. The I-QOL was developed from interviews of individuals with urinary incontinence (n = 90). Refining the questionnaire was accomplished by structured interviews of individuals with urinary incontinence (n = 17). The rigorous development process ensured that the measure was complete and understandable.Testing the I-QOL's psychometric properties involved two administrations (n = 62) along with measures of psychological well-being and functional status. The I-QOL proved to be internally consistent (a 0.95) and highly reproducible (r = 0.93, 18 days, SD 4). For discriminant validity, severity of incontinence (p < 0.0001) and number of medical appointments in the past year to treat incontinence (p < 0.0001) significantly predicted I-QOL scores using one-way analysis of variance. Convergent validity analyses confirmed our predictions that the I-QOL scores were more closely related to overall well-being than bodily pain The I-QOL proved to be valid and reproducible as a self-administered measure for assessing quality of life of people with urinary incontinence.",

Wahl Department of Public Health and Primary Health Care, University of Bergen Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic skin diseases characterized by distinctive lesions being a silvery gray scaling papule or plaque. Few studies describe quality of life and coping in patients with psoriasis. Quality of life and coping are important concepts in nursing science and nursing practice. Therefore the aim of this study is to analyze the perception of quality of life and coping in patients suffering from psoriasis. So far, 175 patients are included in the study. Patients are recruited from hospitals and outpatient clinics. Quality of life is measured using generic and disease specific instruments: Quality of life scale, SF-36 and Psoriasis Disability Index. Coping is based on the definition of Lazarus and Folkman (1984) and is measured using the Jalowiec Coping Scale. Results from the study will be presented at the conference. The purpose of this study was to determine if quality of life, as operationalized by the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) would improve in patients treated with three doses of tolcapone when compared to patients treated with placebo. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is emerging as a critical outcome measure in health care and more recently in neurology. Traditional outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (I'D) have focused on motoric function. I'D also has an enormous impact on psychosocial well being, role fulfillment, sexuality and self esteem. Psychosocial dysfunction may render a patient as disabled as changes in motor function. This experimental study was done with a subset of patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 46) who were participating in a double-blind placebo controlled dose finding study of 50mg, 200mg and 400mg of tolcapone. Nineteen females and 27 males were randomly assigned to three doses of tolcapone or placebo. Duration of PD averaged 10 years (range 2-20), mean motor function as determined by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was 37.5 prior to treatment.Improvement in overall quality of life (repeated measures ANOVA) was significantly improved in patients treated with all doses of tolcapone (p = 0.003). Overall illness impact per cent change improvement in the 400 mg group was 43% compared to the 200mg group (23%) and the 50mg group (20%). Greater per cent change improvement was found in HRQOL outcome measures than in the traditional motor function measure. Quality of life per cent change ranged from 3%-43% compared to motor function change range of 2%-S% in patients treated with tolcapone. In contrast patients treated with placebo experienced a 2% worsening in motor function.The findings of this evaluative study suggest that HRQOL was improved for patients taking tolcapone. HRQOL may be a very promising outcome measure for determining both the impact of Parkinson's disease as well as to determine the efficacy of new treatments over time. Apart from combining into an overall score, specific information on aspects of well-being in terms of anxiety, depression, vitality, self-control, health and general well-being can be derived. The index is psychometrically well-documented, and has been used extensively in clinical trials in hypertension in order to ensure that potential adverse events do not affect the wellbeing. Similarly, it has been used in symptomatic conditions to study the impact of symptom relief on well-being. It has also been advocated as the instrument of choice for the assessment of well-being in clinical trials. (Bulpitt CJ, Fletcher AE. PharmacoEconomics 1994; 6: 523-535. Fletcher A. Br J Clin Phmmac 1995; 39: 217-222. Beth P. PharmacoEconomics 1995; 7: 141-151.) Translations into a number of languages have been performed in accordance with proposed guidelines (Guillemin F, Bombardier C, Beaton D. J Clin Epidemiol 1993; 46: 1417-1432.). Using the baseline values of multinational, multicentre clinical trials in hypertension and gastrointestinal disease, the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's a coefficient) was calculated for each of the participating countries. Similarly, the baseline values in the two conditions were compared, and finally the well-being scores, distributed by gender were computed. The internal-consistency reliability was generally high for the total score as well as for the different dimensions irrespective of whether a hypertension or a GI population was used to compile the data. For example, using a hypertension study, the internal consistency reliability for the total score of the PGWB was for Australia (n = 115) a = 0.94, Canada (n = 250) a = 0.94, Denmark (n = 210) a = 0.95, Sweden (n = 159) a = 0.95, and Italy (n = 191) a = 0.95. Similarly, a high internal consistency reliability a = 0.93 was found in gastrointestinal patients in the UK (n = 954), in Denmark a = 0.94 (n = 117), and in Sweden a = 0.95 (n = 354) for the total score of the PGWB index. As expected, the mean baseline values of hypertensive patients were compatible with those of a normal population, i.e. around 103-105, whereas gastrointestinal patients scored much lower, from 85-95 depending on whether they suffered from ulcer disease or symptomatic GERD. In terms of gender differences, women scored consistently somewhat and significantly lower than men.The suitability of the PGWB index for use in international multicentre clinical trials was supported bv the fact that despite translations into a number of different languages, the homogeneity and consistency of the scale were supported. Similar to other observations, gender differences were observed. The validity was supported by its ability to discriminate between conditions of varying severity.",

The questionnaire will be subjected to a formal pre-test to assess reliability, construct and criterion validity.The final questionnaire, entitled the CHOICE Health Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ), will be used in a large cohort study of incident dialysis patients.living. In 1992, Elizabeth Condie suggested that therapists 'are good at dealing with impairment; are generally less competent at coping with disability; and are really poor at helping individuals to minimize or manage their handicap'. Could we as therapists have a greater impact on some of the disability and handicap that is seen in this clientele? If so, is it our role to reduce handicap or is it an unrealistic expectation in today's restrictive health economy?Development of a quality of life measure for renal dialysis patients The objective of this study was to develop a measure of health-related quality of life for the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) that would complement the SF-36 and be sensitive to differences in dialysis modality (hemodialysis, HD, and peritoneal dialysis, PD) and dose (intensity and duration). Selection of domains was based on four sources of data:(1) a structured literature review evaluating 65 articles that described 83 instruments; (2) five focus groups conducted with either HD patients, I'D patients, nephrologists or other dialysis providers (transcripts subjected to content analysis); (3) a survey of 110 dialysis asked about patient concerns and relevant features of different modalities;and (4) an open-ended, semi-structured survey of 25 ESRD patients asked about the effects of dialysis on functioning and quality of life to gain additional breadth of responses. Two additional steps helped to prioritize domains and items. First, a representative sample of 152 dialysis patients rated each item for frequency and bother using Likert-type rating scales. Domains were selected for the pilot questionnaire based upon item ranking of the product of frequency and bother and discordance between HD and I'D patients. Second, we obtained advice from a panel of nephrologists about saliency of items to modality or dose differences. Items and scales representing the domains were selected, with a preference for the use of existing measures which were reliable and valid in previous studies of ESRD patients.These first four steps yielded 21 candidate domains composed of 100 total items: eight domains in the SF-36 (general health perceptions, physical functioning, pain, mental health, energy, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning and social functioning); seven additional generic domains (cognitive functioning, sexual functioning, sleep, work, recreation, finances and quality of life); and six ESRD specific domains including dialysis access (i.e., catheters or vascular access), diet, freedom, time, body image and symptoms.

Subjects were enrolled from May 1991-June 1993. Eligible patients had HIV-infection, a suspected diagnosis of PCP and an alveolar-arterial gradient of < 45 mmHg.Patients were also eligible if PCP was not confirmed.Study therapy was administered for 21 days +24 hours. Study endpoints included death, therapeutic failure, toxicity and patient-reported functional status and symptoms, assessed using a self-administered battery of scales. Physical functioning was assessed using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), a 12-item index weighted on the basis of known metabolic costs of each activity. Energy, pain and general health perceptions were measured using scales from the MOS-HIV. Disability was measured using two items for days spent in bed and decreased usual activities. Symptom severity was assessed for pulmonary symptoms (cough, dyspnea and chest tightness) and for other symptoms (fever, pain, nausea, rash and dizziness). All scales are scored so that a higher score indicates better health. The questionnaire was available in English and Spanish, and took about 5 minutes to complete. Changes in health status scores were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests at day 7 and day 21. To provide a summary statistic, a random effects model was",
