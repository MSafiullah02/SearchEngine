Actually, if both aged groups were combined together and analyzed as a whole, MALFD subjects had a high likelihood of severe disease when compared with non-MAFLD subjects (26.9% vs 14.5% p =0.004). If multivariate analysis had been performed with the whole cohort, there was a high likelihood that MAFLD would be an independent factor for severe COVID-19, similarly to our observations. 2 On the other hand, in our previous study 3 which included 520 Chinese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD/MAFLD, a statistically significant negative correlation between age and liver inflammation or fibrosis were found. This observation suggested that younger NAFLD/MAFLD patients might have more inflammation which in turn resulted in an increased risk of severe COVID-19 as shown in Zhou's study.",
