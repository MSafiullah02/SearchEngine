            "text": "Until 2001, rehabilitation was available for dialysis patients in Toronto in either acute-care medical/geriatric units or nondialysis rehabilitation units. Most commonly, patients remained in the acute-care hospital ward and therapists would come and deliver therapy for short periods on the acute-ward floor. Therapy sessions occurred on average 2 to 5 times a week, but ranged in duration from 15 to 40 minutes according to the acute-care workload. Less commonly, patients were transferred to specialized rehabilitation units where they would receive formal therapy sessions in an environment promoting independence. Patients would be temporarily discharged to attend their 3-times-weekly dialysis treatment at offsite dialysis units. It appeared that in many cases, the need to make acute-care beds available and the perception that dialysis patients did poorly with rehabilitation meant that patients often were not given sufficient opportunities for rehabilitation before being advised to seek nursing home placement.",

When patients remained in acute care for ongoing rehabilitation therapy, the focus of the main health care team was acute medical management, and when patients were transferred to rehabilitation units, the main focus was rehabilitation care with little attention given to ongoing medical issues.6Limited interdisciplinary communication about acute medical problems that interfered with the ability to participate in rehabilitation therapy; for example, pain management in the face of renal failure, edema resulting in decreased ankle mobility, dyspnea with exertion, orthostasis, and effects of sedative medications.\n",

A 6-station dialysis suite was built in preexisting space 2 floors below the inpatient ward unit within the rehabilitation hospital. The program was designed with several unique features, including 12 dedicated nephrology rehabilitation beds, a simplified timely referral process, and the ability to provide short daily dialysis on site.

Medical coverage for the ward and dialysis units was provided by a hospitalist (from Toronto Rehabilitation Institute) and a nephrologist (from University Health Network).

Patients requiring ventilation, inotropic support, or cardiac monitoring, as well as those with untunneled hemodialysis catheters, were not eligible. Feeding tubes, tracheostomies, or lack of social support and stable mild cognitive impairment or dementia were not contraindications. Initially, the program was designed for those older than 65 years; however, with time, this age limit was lowered to those older than 55 years, with priority for those aged 65-plus years.

Our data suggest that geriatric rehabilitation is feasible for older hemodialysis patients after acute care hospitalization or acute loss of function, and a substantial proportion of patients can return to their homes. Based on the impressions of the authors (S.V.J., R.L.), providing dialysis in short daily sessions and integrating care in a multidisciplinary team were key ingredients for success of the program. Whereas short daily dialysis was designed primarily to increase rehabilitation efficiency by limiting scheduling conflicts and interference between medical and rehabilitation treatments,17 we heard from patients that they preferred daily dialysis and reported higher energy levels. We believe short daily dialysis may have been less exhausting for patients, allowed more dietary flexibility, and improved fluid and electrolyte control. In addition, patients seemed less anxious about their dialysis schedule and overall were very willing to participate in rehabilitation treatments. We also noted increased collaboration between caregivers over time, with detailed discussion of the goals, achievements, and challenges for each patient in the weekly team meetings. We noted reciprocal continued medical education between staff of different disciplines and close collaboration between the various health professions involved in dialysis and rehabilitation care.",

Comparisons with previously published studies are limited because most studies were small, involved younger dialysis patients, and omitted clinical details about concurrent comorbid illnesses, diabetes status, and so on.17, 18, 19, 22, 23 Only 1 study involved dialysis patients with an average age older than 70 years.20 In that study, 80% of patients did poorly with rehabilitation. In other studies, dialysis patients were often 10 to 15 years younger and were admitted after acute surgical procedures. The largest of these, by Forrest et al,17 reported outcomes for 40 dialysis patients. In their study, only 8 of 40 patients were reported as \u201cmedically complicated.\u201d Average LOS was 12 days, substantially shorter than the LOS in our population (average LOS, 48 days). Age, patient comorbidity, and differences in health care systems may explain these discrepancies. In Canada, health care is provincially funded and therefore accessible to all regardless of health insurance coverage. Therefore, we believe a more appropriate comparison group may be nondialysis patients admitted to a geriatric facility within Canada. One such study is by Patrick et al.36 In that study, non\u2013dialysis-dependent geriatric patients admitted for rehabilitation after an acute hospitalization had similar overall improvements in raw FIM scores from the time of admission to discharge.

In particular, both the nephrologist (S.V.J.) and the hospitalist (R.L.) involved in our program had a strong interest in rehabilitation and care of older dialysis patients, and their enthusiasm may have had a significant role to generate momentum, particularly in the early stages of the program. Our outcome measures of achieving prespecified rehabilitation goals and the discharge destination are subjective, and although they have face validity, they are not validated. Furthermore, the discharge destination may be influenced by many factors, including social and financial resources. However, use of the FIM score is mandated across Canada and previously was validated.37, 38, 39 Although ordinal and prone to a high incidence of both ceiling and floor effects, use of the FIM score allows comparisons of our data with those of other units.",
