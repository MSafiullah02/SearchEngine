The newborn calves are housed in single crates with straw bedding during the first two weeks of life (K0) and are supplied with colostrum in the first two days after birth. From the third day of life on, milk replacer is fed three times a day from buckets. From the third week of life on, the female calves are stabled in groups of 24 animals in large pens with deep litter (K1) and milk replacer is fed from an automatic feeder. Hay and concentrates are offered ad libitum. The farm has a persistent history of clinical cryptosporidiosis in young calves, mainly in the second week of life. The field isolate was determined as C. parvum bovine genotype (Najdrowski et al., 2007).",

For each sample, the number of oocysts in 20 randomly chosen fields of vision was determined and divided by 20 to calculate the average score. Since the examination technique was semi-quantitative, a score was generated to differ between low, moderate and high oocyst counts.

It has been reported that this product is active against C. parvum in vitro (Joachim et al., 2003b). However, in the field it appears difficult if not impossible to reduce the oocyst number in a presumably heavily contaminated environment below the level needed to infect calves. No reliable data regarding the infective dose is available for cattle, but the median infective dose of C. parvum oocysts in men is as low as 132 oocysts (DuPont et al., 1995). Considering that millions of oocysts can be shed in one gram of calf faeces and that several hundreds of oocysts are sufficient to infect calves, it is obvious, that even inactivation of 99% of oocysts (which is defined as sufficient under in vitro conditions) may not absolutely prevent infection with the consequence of rapid recontamination of calf stables. In addition to remains of previous contamination in cleaned and disinfected crates and rapid increase of infection pressure by droppings of diseased calves kept in the same environment, animal keepers and other mechanical vectors (e.g. flies) may help to distribute oocysts into appropriately cleaned and disinfected premises (Graczyk et al., 2000).",

Therefore, this strategy was applied on all calves of the respective age group in study 2, supplemented by additional disinfection of the K1 area (group housing) to avoid exposure of previously protected calves to infection after movement to a potentially contaminated group pen. Under farm conditions the simultaneous keeping of non-protected controls would bear the risk of accidental carryover of oocysts into the experimental premises and thus might alter the interpretability of results. On the other hand, without a control group it is difficult to estimate the course of infection if disinfection and treatment were not applied. We attempted to resolve this dilemma by examining a control group and performing the control strategy trial subsequently, assuming that the overall conditions are comparable and results obtained from the controls can be extrapolated to the study period.",
