Oxidants modify biologic macromolecules, potentially leading to cellular dysfunction and death. In addition, the redox state can alter gene expression via effects on redoxsensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor-\u03baB and activator protein-1. Defenses against oxidants include superoxide dismutases, which convert O 2 \u2212 to H 2 O 2 ; catalase and other enzymes that decompose H 2 O 2 ; and antioxidants such as glutathione, a tripeptide derived from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione concentrations in epithelial lining fl uid (\u2248400 \u03bcM) are approximately two orders of magnitude higher than in nonlung extracellular fl uids and plasma, and within cells glutathione constitutes \u224890% of the nonprotein thiol groups. 16 Circumstantial evidence suggests that alterations in redox balance promote fi brosis. Many agents that induce fi brosis (e.g., asbestos, silica, bleomycin, ionizing radiation) produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly. Infl ammatory cells from IPF lungs produce higher concentrations of oxidants than normal cells, and lavage fl uid from IPF patients contains a high level of 8-isoprostane, a product of lipid peroxidation widely used as a marker of oxidative stress. Epithelial lining fl uid from IPF patients has a reduced glutathione concentration (\u224825% of normal). 17 There are compelling links between redox biology and the fi brotic process. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2, a key profi brotic cytokine, causes reduced expression of \u03b3glutamyl cysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione production, and induces the production of ROS by myofi broblasts isolated from IPF lung. 18 In addition, the latent form of TGF-\u03b2 is activated by ROS. 19 Mice defi cient in the redox-regulated transcription factor Nrf2, which is involved in the expression of several antioxidant enzyme systems, have increased fi brosis after bleomycin injury. 20 Reactive oxygen species can increase proliferation of fi broblasts and cause epithelial cell death.",

N-acetyl cysteine attenuates bleomycin-induced lung infl ammation and subsequent fi brosis in mice and stabilizes lung function in IPF patients. 21 Apoptosis Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death characterized by activation of a set of cysteine proteases (caspases), packaging of the cell remnants into membranebound vesicles that are taken up by surrounding cells, and lack of an infl ammatory response. 22 Apoptosis is conceptually distinct from another form of programmed cell death (autophagy) and from nonprogrammed cell death (necrosis), although in practice these forms of cell death are often not clearly distinguishable. Triggers of apoptosis involve extrinsic signals that trigger tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members with a death domain (e.g., the Fas receptor) and/or intrinsic signals such as DNA damage that cause release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and subsequent activation of a caspase cascade. Apoptosis can be induced by interruption of normal cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, a process referred to as anoikis.",

Inhibition of apoptosis with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVADfmk inhibits fi brosis in the bleomycin model. The role of apoptosis has also been studied in mice with an inducible TGF-\u03b2 transgene expressed in lung epithelium; TGF-\u03b2 expression in these mice causes a wave of apoptosis, followed by fi brosis, both of which are blocked by zVADfmk. 23, 24 Finally, intratracheal administration of an activating anti-Fas antibody, which binds to Fas expressed on epithelial cells, leads to lung epithelial cell apoptosis and fi brosis. 22 There are several possible causes for increased numbers of apoptotic epithelial cells in IPF. Epithelial cells overlying a fi broblastic focus may undergo anoikis. Li and colleagues showed that IPF myofi broblasts release angiotensin II, which triggers epithelial cell apoptosis, and captopril prevents fi brosis in several rodent models. 25 Oxidant stress and TGF-\u03b2 signaling may also contribute to epithelial apoptosis. In patients with mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein-C (SP-C), cellular dysfunction and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response may cause apoptosis of AT2 cells, and one can speculate that protein misfolding or traffi cking abnormalities in AT2 cells might occur in IPF due to environmental and/or genetic factor(s). Vandivier and colleagues suggest that impaired apoptotic cell removal may also be a factor. 26 How epithelial cell apoptosis leads to fi brosis is not known. A simple explanation is that loss of epithelial barrier function leads to formation of a fi brinous exudate followed by an abnormal fi broblast response. Also, apoptotic cells or the cells that engulf them can release the profi brotic cytokine TGF-\u03b2, 26 triggering other cellular and biochemical changes that promote development of fi brosis.",

Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, each composed of an \u03b1and a \u03b2-subunit. \u03b1v\u03b26 is one of 24 mammalian integrins, 8 of which bind arginine-glycineaspartic acid sequences. \u03b1v\u03b26 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells. Activation of TGF-\u03b21 by \u03b1v\u03b26 requires an intact actin cytoskeleton and tethering of latent TGF-\u03b21 to the extracellular matrix by LTBP1. 33 Proteaseactivated receptor-1 signaling enhances actin contractility and \u03b1v\u03b26-mediated TGF-\u03b21 activation. 34 In the lung, \u03b1v\u03b26 normally is expressed at a low level but is sharply upregulated by infl ammatory stimuli. \u03b26-integrin knockout mice develop lung infl ammation and ultimately emphysema, are protected from acute lung injury, and are resistant to fi brosis. 35, 36 All these effects are due to, or at least consistent with, reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Bleomycin-treated \u03b26 knockout mice have more lung infl ammation than wild-type controls, indicating that infl ammation and fi brosis can be dissociated. Other mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2 activation in the lung may also come into play; for example, IL-13-dependent lung fi brosis is dependent on TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and proteases (plasmin and matrix metalloproteinases) appear to be the activators. 29, 30 Also, bleomycin-stimulated alveolar macrophages activate TGF-\u03b2 using plasmin and thrombospondin-1. 37 Once activated, TGF-\u03b2 sets in motion a wide range of profi brotic processes (Figure 46.3) . In addition to its direct effects, TGF-\u03b2 upregulates other profi brotic molecules such as platelet-derived growth factor, ROS, and connective tissue growth factor. Connective tissue growth factor, a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins, is a downstream mediator of TGF-\u03b2 effects. Its signaling function is not well understood but may derive in part from its ability to enhance binding of TGF-\u03b2 to TGF-\u03b2 receptors. 38 Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signal-ing causes autoinduction of the TGFb-1 gene and upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 activators (\u03b1v\u03b26 and ROS), suggesting the possibility of a positive feedback loop in TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Endogenous negative regulators of TGF-\u03b2 signaling include an inhibitory Smad (Smad7), which is induced by TGF-\u03b2, and extracellular molecules such as decorin and \u03b1 2 -macroglobulin. Impaired Smad7 expression may contribute to scarring in scleroderma. 39 ",

Furthermore, a specifi c form of EBV (the Wzhet rearrangement) that favors active replication was found to occur much more frequently in IPF patients (59%) than in controls (2%). 42 Causality cannot be proved in such studies but can be assessed in animal models.

The 3.7-kDa mature protein is generated from a 21-kDa precursor ( Figure  46.4) . Surfactant protein C processing involves translocation of the proprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum, folding, and addition of two palmitic acid residues, a total of four proteolytic cleavages of the N-and C-terminal propeptide domains to generate mature SP-C, release of SP-C into the lumen of the lamellar body where it associates with surfactant phospholipids and proteins, and secretion into the alveolar space. 45 Surfactant protein C mutations in patients with interstitial lung disease occur in several locations and act in an autosomal dominant fashion. Almost all mutations occur in the luminal part of the proprotein, and most are within the \u2248100 amino acid C-terminal region (Phe94-Ile197) that forms a so-called BRICHOS domain.
