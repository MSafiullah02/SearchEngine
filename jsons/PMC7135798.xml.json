The selection of a credible spokesperson facilitates effective information dissemination as the public receive information from diverse sources during the uncertain and chaotic situation of a health crisis. A study of public perceptions of information sources concerning bioterrorism, before and after anthrax attacks, indicated the importance of national and regional health officials as spokespersons in this event.17 In response to the anthrax attacks of 2001, selecting credible spokespersons was found to be one of the challenges for the CDC,18 and the use of multiple spokespersons and poor message control were found to result in the loss of CDC credibility.19 A recent study regarding public health officials as potential spokespeople revealed that news stories containing interviews with public health officials were 15.2 times more likely to report quality information, after controlling for station affiliate or geographic location.20 The characteristics and performance of official spokespersons would influence the public's actions and their perception and trust during crisis communication.7, 13\n",
