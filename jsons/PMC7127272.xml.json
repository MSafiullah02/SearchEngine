For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected China in 2003, myxomatosis caused enormous decreases in the rabbit population in Australia in the 1950s, the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century killed up to a quarter of the human population. Mathematical modelling is of considerable importance in epidemiology because it may provide understanding of the underlying mechanisms which influence the spread of disease and may suggest control strategies. In the case where the infectious lose immunity and become susceptible immediately after recovering, an SIS epidemic model is used to describe the dynamics of the population [1]. Recent years have also seen wide-scope potential applications of the SIS epidemic model in various scientific fields, such as that of complex networks [2].",

For example, Rass [3] obtained asymptotic stability for a multi-type SIS model, and Iannelli et al. [4] considered an age-structured epidemic model of SIS type and analyzed the global dynamical behavior for the model when the population density converges uniformly to a steady state. Global analysis of discrete-time SI and SIS epidemic models was given in [5]. Further, the complex dynamical behavior of the SIS epidemic model is discussed by using bifurcation theory. For example, Zhang et al. [6] obtained the conditions of backward bifurcation and the existence of bistable endemic equilibria. Zhang et al. [7] investigated Hopf bifurcation in a delayed SIS epidemic model with stage structure by using the normal form theory and the center manifold argument.",

Impulsive differential equations (IDEs) are suitable for the mathematical simulation of evolutionary processes in which the parameters undergo relatively long periods of smooth variation followed by a short-term rapid change in their values. The study of IDEs mainly concerns the properties of their solutions, such as the existence, uniqueness, stability, boundedness, and periodicity; see [8], [9]. Sufficient conditions for the local and global stability of the susceptible pest-eradication periodic solution are found by means of Floquet theory and comparison methods in [10]. Nieto and Regan [11] present a new approach via variational methods and critical point theory for obtaining the existence of solutions to impulsive problems. The dynamics of an impulsively controlled three-trophic food chain system with general nonlinear functional responses for the intermediate consumer and the top predator are analyzed using the Floquet theory and comparison techniques in [12]. IDEs are widely used in epidemiology. For example, an SIS epidemic model with a pulse vaccination was investigated in [13] and some results are obtained for the global stability of the disease-free periodic solution as well as the existence and stability of the endemic periodic solution are investigated analytically and numerically.",

However, little is known about the bifurcation theory of an epidemic model built from IDEs. Periodic boundary value problems for non-Lipschitzian impulsive functional differential equations were considered in [17]. Using a projection method, the bifurcation of positive periodic solutions for an impulsively controlled pest management mode was discussed in [18]. The complex dynamics of a Holling type II prey\u2013predator system with state feedback control was investigated in [19]. Zhou and Liu [13] discussed the existence of a disease-free periodic solution and an endemic periodic solution by using the explicit solution. Lakmeche et al. [20] transformed the problem of periodic solution into a fixed-point problem and obtained conditions for the stability of the trivial solution and the existence of a positive period-1 solution. Many authors (for example, see [21]) discussed only the bifurcation of a non-trivial periodic solution of an epidemic model by using the results obtained in [20]. By using the explicit solution, the stroboscopic map is obtained and used to discuss the bifurcation of the periodic solution in [16]. However, the explicit solution is not easy to obtain in an epidemic model and the bifurcation of the endemic periodic solution is difficult to discuss. Some authors investigated the complex dynamics of epidemic models, such as period-doubling bifurcation, chaos and crisis etc., by means of numerical simulations; see [22] for example. Therefore, theoretically analyzing the bifurcation theory of the SIS model is a challenging task.",

If r=0 all density dependence acts through the death rate, and if r=1 all density dependence acts through the birth rate. The newborn population is assumed to be susceptible to disease, that is, \u0394S=(b\u2212c(S+I))(S+I) and \u0394I=0. Now, on the basis of the impulsive differential equations, we develop system (1) by introducing periodic birth pulses and obtain the following epidemic model with birth pulses: (2){S\u02d9=\u2212\u03c3S\u2212\u03b2SI+\u03b4I,I\u02d9=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03b4I\u2212\u03c3I,}t\u2260nT,\u0394S=(b\u2212c(S+I))(S+I),\u0394I=0,}t=nT, where 0<b<1,c>0, the meanings of parameters \u03b2,\u03c3, and \u03b4 are the same as in model (1), n\u2208N+, T is the time between two consecutive birth pulses, \u0394S(t)=S(t+)\u2212S(t), S(t+) are the quantities of susceptible components of the population after the birth pulse and S(t+)=lim\u03c4\u21920+S(t+\u03c4), \u0394I(t)=I(t+)\u2212I(t), I(t+)=lim\u03c4\u21920+I(t+\u03c4).

Map (11) may be rewritten as (20)Fb:(xy)\u21a6((1+b\u2212cxexp(\u2212\u03c3T))xexp(\u2212\u03c3T)A(x)y+B(x)), where (21)A(x)=exp(\u2212\u222b0T(\u03b2xexp(\u2212\u03c3t)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))dt)B(x)=\u03b2exp(\u2212\u222b0T(\u03b2xexp(\u2212\u03c3t)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))dt)\u222b0Texp(\u222b0t(\u03b2xexp(\u2212\u03c3\u03c4)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))d\u03c4)dt. The map f\u03bc:R\u2192R in Lemma 5.2 is one-dimensional while the map (20) is two-dimensional in our case. The center manifold theorem is used here to obtain a one-dimensional map; hence, flip bifurcation is discussed.For b=3exp(\u03c3T)\u22121, it follows from (12) that the fixed point of map (20) is (22)(x0,y0)=(2exp(2\u03c3T)c,\u03b2\u222b0Texp(\u222b0t(2\u03b2exp(2\u03c3T)cexp(\u2212\u03c3\u03c4)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))d\u03c4)dtexp(\u222b0T(2\u03b2exp(2\u03c3T)cexp(\u2212\u03c3t)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))dt)\u22121).\nLetting u=x\u2212x0, v=y\u2212y0 and b~=b\u22123exp(\u03c3T)+1, we transform the fixed point (x0,y0) of map (20) to the origin; then the map (20) becomes (23)(uv)\u21a6(\u2212u+2exp(\u03c3T)cb~+exp(\u2212\u03c3T)b~u\u2212cexp(\u22122\u03c3T)u2A(u+x0)v+B~(u+x0)), where B~(u+x0)=A(u+x0)y0+B(u+x0)\u2212y0.On using y0=A(x0)y0+B(x0),exp(ax)=1+ax+O(|x|2),A(u+x0)=exp(\u2212\u222b0T(\u03b2(u+x0)exp(\u2212\u03c3t)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))dt)=exp(\u03b2(exp(\u03c3T)\u22121)u\u03c3)A(x0),B(u+x0)=exp(\u03b2(exp(\u03c3T)\u22121)u\u03c3)B(x0)+A1u+O(|u|2),\n(23) becomes (24)(uv)\u21a6(\u221210A1A(x0))(uv)+(f1(u,v,b~)g1(u,v,b~)), where A1=exp(\u03b2(exp(\u03c3T)\u22121)u\u03c3)\u222b0Texp(\u222b0t(\u03b2(x0)exp(\u2212\u03c3\u03c4)\u2212(\u03b4+\u03c3))d\u03c4)\u03b2tdt,f1(u,v,b~)=2exp(\u03c3T)cb~+exp(\u2212\u03c3T)b~u\u2212cexp(\u22122\u03c3T)u2,g1(u,v,T~)=\u03b2(exp(\u03c3T)\u22121)\u03c3uv+O(|u|2+|v|2). If we let (25)J=(10\u2212A11+A01A0),where A0=A(x0), and use the translation (uv)=J(x~y~), then map (24) becomes (26)(x~y~)\u21a6(\u2212100A0)(x~y~)+(f(x~,y~,b~)g(x~,y~,b~)), where f(x~,y~,b~)=f1(x~,\u2212A11+A0x~+1A0y~,b~)=2exp(\u03c3T)cb~+exp(\u2212\u03c3T)b~x~\u2212cexp(\u22122\u03c3T)x~2,g(x~,y~,b~)=A1A01+A0f1(x~,\u2212A11+A0x~+1A0y~,b~)+A0g1(x~,\u2212A11+A0x~+1A0y~,b~).\nNow the center manifold theorem is used to determine the nature of the bifurcation of the fixed point (x~,y~)=(0,0) at b~=0. There exists a center manifold for (26) which can be represented as follows: Wc(0)={(x~,y~,T~)\u2208R3|y~=h(x~,b~),h(0,0)=0,Dh(0,0)=0}. In view of the form of f(x~,y~,b~), it is not necessary to calculate h(x~,b~) in our case, and the map restricted to the center manifold is given by (27)f\u00af:x~\u21a6\u2212x~+2exp(\u03c3T)cb~+exp(\u2212\u03c3T)b~x~\u2212cexp(\u22122\u03c3T)x~2. Thus (\u2202f\u00af\u2202b\u00af\u22022f\u00af\u2202x\u00af2+2\u22022f\u00af\u2202x\u00af\u2202b\u00af)=2exp(\u03c3T)c\u22c5(\u22122cexp(\u22122\u03c3T))+2exp(\u2212\u03c3T)=\u22122exp(\u2212\u03c3T)\u22600 anda\u00af=12(\u22022f\u00af\u2202x\u00af2)2+13(\u22023f\u00af\u2202x\u00af3)=2c2exp(\u22124\u03c3T)>0 at (x~,b~)=(0,0). Then conditions (F1) and (F2) hold. So a flip bifurcation occurs in view of Lemma 5.2. A positive 2T-periodic solution bifurcates from the positive 1T-periodic solution at b\u00af=0, that is, (28)b=3exp(\u03c3T)\u22121\u2254b\u2217\u2217. Since a\u00af>0 in (F2), then the positive 2T-periodic solution is stable. This also means that for some \u03f5>0, system (2) has a positive stable 2T-periodic solution for b\u2208(3exp(\u03c3T)\u22121,3exp(\u03c3T)\u22121+\u03f5). Thus we complete the proof of Proposition 5.2.\n",

Fig. 3(b) shows the period-3 window. The period-3 solution is stable for b\u2208(3.448,3.462) and another flip bifurcation occurs at b=3.462.",

Both theoretical and experimental investigation have revealed that the three main routes to chaos are the route via torus bifurcation, the period-doubling route, and intermittency. From Fig. 3(a), we know that the route to chaos is period-doubling bifurcation in our case. Fig. 4(d) shows that chaos does exist in system (29) for b=3.2.",

For avoiding extinction, T should be less than 1\u03c3ln(1+b). A positive periodic solution (period 1) bifurcates from this infection-free periodic solution at b=b\u2217\n(19) through a supercritical bifurcation; a period-2 solution bifurcates from this positive periodic solution (period 1) at b=3exp(\u03c3T)\u22121 through flip bifurcation (period-doubling bifurcations).
