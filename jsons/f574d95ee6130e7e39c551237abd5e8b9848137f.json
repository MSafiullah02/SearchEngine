            "text": "Since bat rabies surveillance was first implemented in France in 1989, 48 autochthonous rabies cases without human contamination have been reported using routine diagnosis methods. In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter). In this study, we have provided the details of the geographical distribution of EBLV-1a in the south-west of France and the north-south division of EBLV-1b with its subdivisions into three phylogenetic groups: group B1 in the north-west, group B2 in the centre and group B3 in the north-east of France.",

About 70% of bats are insectivores and most of the rest are frugivores. A few species feed on animals other than insects, one example being the hematophagous vampire bats. Bats are present throughout the world and play vital ecological roles in many ecosystems. Although much is known about the ecology and physiology of bats, they are also among the less studied mammals with regard to immunology [2] . Currently, more than 100 viruses have been isolated from bats [3] . Bats have been shown to be involved in several emergent viral diseases caused by coronaviruses, flaviviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses and lyssaviruses [4] .",

EBLV-1 circulates widely throughout Europe with two variants, which are EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b. Variant a exhibits an east-west distribution from Russia to the centre of France with very little genetic variation while variant b exhibits a south-north distribution from Spain to Denmark and far more genetic diversity [10] . Most EBLV-2 cases were isolated in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands, and although EBLV-2 was detected in Finland, Germany and Switzerland, two countries neighbouring on France, up to now no cases of EBLV-2 have been reported in our country. EBLV-1 is mainly associated with the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) with 95% of the cases [11] and E. isabellinus in Spain [12] while EBLV-2 is reported mainly in Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) and pond bats (Myotis dasycneme). Single rabies cases have also been found in Myotis myotis and Plecotus auritus in Poland and occasionally in other bat species [13] . These include P. nathusii and P. pipistrellus in Germany, R. ferrumequinum in Turkey and Nyctalus noctula in Yugoslavia [14] .",

Taking into account the 32 unique sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis and the 15 identical sequences (with respectively 13 and 2 isolates belonging to groups B and A), the subgroups B1 and B3, composed of 11 and 18 samples respectively appeared to be restricted to the NW (n = 8) and the NE of France (n = 18), respectively ( Figure 5 ). 3 samples belonging to subgroup B1 came respectively from the centre (n = 2) and from the northeast (n = 1). The first positive case reported in the north-east of France (Bainville, KJ210395) in 1989 belongs to subgroup B1. Identically, the second case [AY245835] reported on 1995 in Bourges (centre of France) was also grouped in B1 with an additional case occurring in the same city (Bourges, KJ210394) on 2012. The 9 remaining samples belonging to subgroup B2 were located in the centre of France, with 6 samples in the Centre region, 2 in Auvergne and 1 in Bourgogne, while all EBLV-1a samples (group A, n = 9 samples) were located in the SW of France ( Figure 5 ).",

In 2012, BBLV was reported for the first time in Myotis nattereri in France thanks to effective collaboration with bat workers [8] . Our study showed, in conjunction with the increase of bat submissions, a high proportion of pipistrelles (<40%), one of the most abundant bat species in France and also in southern Europe, over the period 2001-2013. All 1176 submitted pipistrelles were diagnosed negative for the presence of rabies, as previously reported in the Netherlands [31] . P. pipistrellus, which shows strong synanthropic behaviour, might be less exposed to lyssavirus [32] . Our results, in association with the philopatric behavior of this bat species could indicate, as previously suggested, that the risk of P. pistrellus infection with a Lyssavirus is almost non-existent [32] although its cohabitation with serotines is well known (Christine Harbusch, personal communication). The other bat species (Plecotus auritus, Nyctalus noctula) occasionally found to be infected with EBLV-1 were also found negative in our study, demonstrating that these tree-dwelling bats are also rarely infected with EBLV-1.",

In addition, passive surveillance could lack sensitivity due to the small numbers of serotine bats submitted for rabies diagnosis compared to the estimated numbers for this species in France (400,000-600,000) (Laurent Arthur, personal communication). Furthermore, high fluctuations in the numbers of bat submissions were observed between geographical areas. For example, in the centre of France, in an area of approximately 39,151 km 2 [the total area of France is 552,000 km 2 ], 7 serotine bats were found to be infected out of a total of 21 tested serotines and out of 48 positive cases. Up to now, 140 colonies of serotine bats have been reported in this region out of a total of 987 colonies housing other species [34] . While serotines are shown to be distributed throughout the country [35] and while some aspects of serotine bat ecology have been studied, including diet, habitat use, foraging and roosting behaviour, others are mostly unknown, especially its hibernation ecology, mating system, dispersal and population structure. An understanding of the spatial ecology, behaviour and social dynamics of serotine bat populations is Previous studies showed that the incidence of rabies in bats submitted for rabies diagnosis exhibited a strong seasonal pattern with two peaks, in the spring and autumn [36, 37] . This seasonality has recognized importance for epizootiological processes [38] . The infection status of bats has already been shown to be affected by season for some viruses, including lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, coronoviruses and filoviruses [2] . Using passive surveillance data, we report for the first time in Europe the seasonality of the rabies incidence rate in bats, with a higher rabies incidence detected in autumn (September to November) reaching 34%. In our study, 81% ( = 38/47) of positive cases were detected between June and October. The highest probability of detecting a rabies case among submitted bats in autumn rather in summer could be explained by the natural dispersal of serotine bats which promotes the contact rates between males/females, adults/juveniles and between infected and susceptible animals. Dispersal is a poorly understood event in the serotine bat species, as is the mating period and the ecology of males. No adult males are found within maternity roosts, indicating exclusion once they reach sexual maturity [39] . The mating period, taking place in late summer/early autumn (August-October), could also promote the diffusion of EBLV-1 in bats.",

            "text": "As previously suggested [37] , the interaction of the incubation period with hibernation and the annual birth pulse, which starts for serotines in early June but which depends on the climate, can generate complex dynamics for the rabies virus. To date, current knowledge about rabies in serotines in Europe is limited. Little is known about the virulence, dissemination or transmission of the virus among free-living insectivorous bats, or abouts the incubation period of European bat lyssaviruses. Although the incubation period is not known for bats naturally infected with EBLV-1, experimental EBLV-1 studies of E. serotinus and E. fuscus with an inoculation dose of 10 3.2 LD50/ml showed that the incubation periods varied depending on the route of inoculation, and were respectively between 7 to 26 days and 9 and 58 days [40, 41] . By comparison, the duration of rabies incubation is also highly variable in bats naturally infected with classical rabies virus, ranging from less than 14 days to over 290 days, and can rarely be greater than a year [42, 43] . These variable incubation periods could also explain the temporal dynamics of rabies incidence in our study. Indeed, several previous studies have shown a higher seroprevalence in summer. Seasonal variation in European bat infection was observed through the analysis of a large blood sample panel in Spanish bats showing a significantly higher seroprevalence of EBLV-1 in the summer, at which time maternity colonies are present in most of the bat colonies [32] . This seasonal variability was also shown in Brazilian free-tailed bats in natural cave roosts [44] , indicating that roosting ecology and reproductive activity could favor bat infection. This higher seroprevalence in summer reflecting higher rabies exposure could, depending on the incubation period, lead to a higher rabies mortality rate following RV exposure in the subsequent months, and mainly in autumn. The higher seroprevalence reported in summer could also be the result of the higher metabolism of serotine bats in summer than in winter and spring.",

To date, despite the strengthening of passive surveillance, neither EBLV-2 nor WCBV have been isolated in France although EBLV-2 was isolated in three neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. (Reviewed by [45] ). Two bat species were shown to be infected by EBLV-2, Daubenton's bat (M. daubentonii) and the pond bat (M. dasycneme). Of the two species, M. dasycneme is reported in the north-west of France, while Daubenton's bat is present throughout France. The absence of EBLV-2 reporting in France has yet to be explained. The number of submissions of M. daubentonii should be increased to provide more elements on the true epidemiological situation of EBLV-2 in France. The real absence of this virus species needs to be proven in the country.",

However, most bats are able to coexist with viruses and may have evolved mechanisms to control viral replication [2] . It is clear that bats can experience either a lethal or non-lethal rabies virus infection, with in the latter case the development of specific neutralising antibodies [46] . We previously reported the presence of EBLV-1 neutralising antibodies in six indigenous bat species throughout France, mainly in E. serotinus and M. myotis, suggesting previous infection with the EBLV-1 rabies virus [47] . However, no EBLV-1 RNA was detected in the RT-PCRs performed on oropharyngeal swabs collected from these six apparently healthy bats [47] . Similarly, a high percentage of seropositive bat species (65%) was recently found in Spain, suggesting that most species of bats are exposed to EBLV-1 [32] .",

NJ phylogenetic tree comparing partial N gene sequence from 32 French EBLV-1 isolates from 1989-2012, 11 referenced European EBLV-1 strains (Poland, Holland, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Russia), 1 EBLV-1 isolate from Luxembourg, 5 EBLV-2 strains (Finland, Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Holland) and two BBLV isolates (France, Germany).

EBLV-1b, which presents far more genetic diversity and a south-north distribution, was mainly reported in Spain, France, Germany, Poland and in the Netherlands [13] . Our study demonstrated that all French EBLV-1 strains belong to the two lineages, a and b, of EBLV-1. Serotines infected with EBLV-1a clustered geographically in the south-west of France while serotines infected by EBLV-1b appeared to be grouped in the centre of France, the north-west and the north-east. Surprisingly, serotines infected by EBLV-1a were geographically separated from the regions displaying EBLV-1b cases. This question of geographic separation has not yet been explained. One hypothesis is that serotines might be a paraphyletic group composed of differentiated lineages at species level, like the Natterer's bat [48] , one species being specific to lineage a and the other species specific to lineage b.",

French passive bat rabies surveillance in particular should be improved with regard to targeted bat species such as serotines, Natterer's bats and Daubenton's bats. These results, complemented by active surveil-lance data [47] , will help clarify the dynamics of EBLV-1 transmission and improve understanding of the cross-species infection process. To date, two cases of natural transmission of EBLV-1 to domestic cats have been reported in France [49] , demonstrating that the two subtypes, a and b, of EBLV-1 are able to cross the species barrier. This clearly implies that bat biologists, virologists, and public health and agricultural service officials must work together closely in order to protect the public and promote bat conservation.",
