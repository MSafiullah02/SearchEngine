On the other hand, dozens of human AMPs known to date display antimicrobial activity against the same human colonizers or pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (Figs. 2 and 3). Also, it is intriguing to observe that even though some AMPs display broad activity spectra, others seem to be anywhere from species\u2010 to kingdom\u2010specific (Fig. 2). While likely to be confounded by observational bias (whereby some species, e.g., E. coli, tend to be tested more frequently than others), this observation also reflects that the activity spectra of AMPs depend not only on their physicochemical properties (which group them according to unique families) but also on target properties and on the environment/biological fluid in which they are found. As the large majority of AMPs identified to date are ABPs (\u223c83%, Figs. 1, 2, 3), most concepts and examples provided in this review will be based on results from studies focusing on ABPs, closely followed by those derived from studies on antiviral and antifungal peptides. However, the same principles tend to apply across all AMPs.",

Furthermore, AMPs act more rapidly than conventional antibiotics and are not affected by the typical resistance mechanisms involving conventional drugs, making them very attractive for therapeutic purposes. In addition, AMPs are not mere microbicide agents, as their scope of action may encompass other functions, such as cellular development and immune system modulation. For instance, fetal keratinocytes express significantly more AMPs compared to neonatal and adult keratinocytes, despite the lower degree of exposition to the environment or to pathogenic agents. These elevated levels of AMPs during fetal stages of development are correlated with increased expression of the histone demethylase JMJD3,7 which in turn also plays a key role in several other fundamental processes, including chromatin organization, cell fate commitment, mesodermal, cardiac muscle, and endothelial cell differentiation, and hippocampus development.8, 9 Also, tear fluid human AMPs such as cationic antimicrobial protein 37 and thymosin\u2010\u03b24 are known to stimulate corneal epithelial cell migration and proliferation in response to injury,10, 11 while lacritin is a glycoprotein that stimulates tear secretion and acts as a mitogen but which, once cleaved, also displays antibacterial activity.12 Thus, AMPs appear to be key mediators involved in several biological processes and to be intrinsically regulated in tandem with other fundamental processes, working together to maintain organic homeostasis. Accordingly, AMPs detain innumerous immune\u2010modulatory properties, namely cytokine modulation, chemotaxis, angiogenesis stimulation, as well as mast cells\u2019 degranulation and consequent vasodilatation, fibrinolysis inhibition, and tissue injury prevention by inhibiting proteases and by reinforcing wound repair. Further information regarding the interplay of AMPs in the innate immune system as well as their alternative roles is given elsewhere,13, 14, 15 and is beyond the scope of this review. Herein, we will revisit the antimicrobial effects of human AMPs.",

In fact, these processes are very dynamic, involving many substrates, precursors, proteases/peptidases, activators, and inhibitors. The majority of AMPs identified in humans appears to result from the cleavage of precursor proteins with other unrelated functions, rather than from the direct transcription and translation into biologically active peptides. Nevertheless, AMPs are an integral element of the innate immune system and not just a product of protein cleavage, representing a defense strategy against invading microorganisms.16 Moreover, as later exemplified, several AMPs resulting from fragmentation of precursor proteins act synergistically with these, in order to fight foreign microorganisms at several defense barriers (Fig. 3).",

Case in point, Bacillus subtilis is known to produce several extremely potent lipopeptides (active at concentrations as low as 0.01\u20130.06 \u03bcM) with antimicrobial activity against several species. One of these, gageotetrin A is a very unique anionic AMP that consists of only leucine and glutamic acid residues conjugated with a unique fatty acid, 3\u2010hydroxy\u201011\u2010methyltridecanoic acid.48 Another example is that of sonorensin from Bacillus sonorensis, a broad\u2010spectrum AMP from the heterocycloanthracin subfamily, active against both Gram\u2010negative and Gram\u2010positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus. Sonorensin displays an amino acid sequence with multiple copies of the same motif, making this peptide rather unique.49 Baceridin is a circular peptide from a plant\u2010associated Bacillus that is synthesized by ribosome\u2010independent machinery and bears only six amino acids, 50% in the D configuration.50 Moreover, baceridin is a proteasome inhibitor, compromising cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells by a p53\u2010independent pathway.50 Copsin from Coprinopsis cinerea is bactericidal against Enterococcus faecium and L. monocytogenes by interacting with the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and interfering with the cell wall biosynthesis.51 Curiously, it is modified with a pyroglutamate, which confers a higher degree of thermal stability and resistance toward protease digestion.51\n",

For instance, it has been demonstrated that all \u03b1\u2010defensins [HNP\u20101, HNP\u20102, HNP\u20103, and HNP\u20104 and human \u03b1\u2010defensin (HD)\u20105 and HD\u20106] and hBD\u20103 prevented HSV infection by blocking virus binding and entry. Such antiviral activity was attributed to HNP\u20101\u20133, HD\u20105, and hBD\u20103's high affinity to HSV's glycoprotein B and HNP\u20104, HD\u20106, and hBD\u20103's avidity toward endogenous heparan sulfate.88 Similarly, protection against HIV is conferred by peptides with lectin properties that can bind viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, crucial for viral attachment, fusion of envelopes with host membranes, and subsequent entry into host cells.89 HNP\u20104 that binds and blocks the action of gp120, and \u03b8\u2010defensins (e.g., the pseudogene retrocyclin) together with the human \u03b11\u2010antitrypsin\u2010derived 20\u2010residue viral\u2010inhibitory peptide both targeting gp41 represent examples of such peptides.90, 91, 92 Likewise, HSV\u20102 infection can also be blocked by retrocyclin, which binds tightly to glycoprotein B2.93 The cyclic peptide lactoferricin seems to compete for the ligation to extracellular heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate, thus preventing the very first event in cytomegalovirus, HSV, and papillomavirus infection.94, 95, 96 Finally, elafin is thought to act indirectly in host cells by hampering viral attachment and probably by modulating host's antiviral and inflammatory responses toward HSV\u20102 infection.97 Synergistically with this mechanism, antiviral peptides can also bind and inhibit the activation of viral co\u2010receptors, leading to further inhibition of glycoproteins\u2010mediated viral attachment. Not only that, HBD\u20102 and \u20103 inhibit viral infection by promoting the internalization of its co\u2010receptor CXCR4.98, 99 Virucidal peptides may also preclude several steps of viral replication by interacting with intracellular targets (Fig. 4). This is the case of HNP\u20101 and HD\u20105, which may prevent HSV replication by binding directly to its DNA.88 Also, HNP\u20101 arrests influenza virus replication by inhibiting protein kinase C phosphorylation, an essential step for nuclear trafficking events.100 Human cathelicidin (LL\u201037) derived peptides, in turn, inhibit reverse transcriptase and viral proteases, thus preventing integration of the viral genetic load into human DNA.101, 102\n",

These peptides consist of 29\u201335 amino acids and adopt a triple\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet conformation. Human neutrophils express four distinct \u03b1\u2010defensins, known as HNP\u20101 to HNP\u20104. Despite having been initially isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes, HNP\u20101 to HNP\u20103 can also be found in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus.119 The remaining two already identified human \u03b1\u2010defensins, HD\u20105 and HD\u20106, are found only in Paneth cells of the small intestine and in epithelial cells, thus being tissue specific.120 Expressed in the aforementioned cell types, AMPs can also be found in bodily fluids in direct contact with these cells. Among the most recent discoveries, HD\u20106 has been found to be active against Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other anaerobic gut commensals, but not (directly) bacteriostatic or bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and may therefore play an important role in maintaining a balance among the microbiota of the gut.121 Similarly, human HD\u20105 is particularly potent against the Gram\u2010positive bacillus Clostridium difficile, one of the most common pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections, whose highly virulent strains often attack small intestine mucosa.122 In addition, \u03b1\u2010defensins may show both cellular and regional specificity throughout the gastrointestinal tract, either secreted or active inside intracellular granules and constitutively expressed or amenable to induction.15, 123, 124 It should also be emphasized that the activity spectrum of \u03b1\u2010defensins is not limited to bacteria and fungi, exhibiting activity against several virus, including HIV, HSV, Adenovirus, and human papillomavirus (HPV), and displaying several unique mechanisms of action (please refer to Section 4.).4 It should be noted that the antimicrobial activity of \u03b1\u2010defensins is influenced even by the difference in one amino acid, such as for HNP\u20101 to HNP\u20103. In fact, an additional acidic residue in HNP\u20103 lowers its effectiveness (most accurately, its potency) against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. This is explained by the easily donated proton, which makes this defensin less positively charged (at least when considering interaction domains only), thus reinforcing the importance of a positive net charge for the antimicrobial activity of AMPs,125, 126 as evidenced in Section 4..",

First, fluid samples require (sometimes multiple) centrifugation steps to remove cells, cellular debris, wastes, and possible contaminants. Then, proteins and peptides in the supernatant are separated and fractionated by multidimensional chromatographic techniques. Within these procedures, proteins and peptides can be initially fractionated by gel filtration (size dimension), followed by cation\u2010exchange (charge dimension) fractionation. Cation\u2010exchange chromatography uses a negatively charged ion exchange resin with affinity for molecules with net positive charge. A salt gradient is used to separate the peptides of interest from other bound peptides, based on their predicted isoelectric point. Finally, peptides can be subject to MS analysis. They are typically ionized by ESI or MALDI and subsequently analyzed in a Q\u2010TOF, IT, or hybrid LTQ. As AMPs tend to be highly basic peptides due to a bias toward arginine and lysine residues, these have a propensity to be particularly enriched when applying cation exchange chromatography based techniques.257 However, because biological fluids are complex matrices, these sometimes require multiple fractionation, isolation, and extraction steps. These are laborious optimization techniques for the detection and quantification of AMPs and, despite their inherent complexity, they are often based in not always accurate functional and structural predictions.",

As boiling denatures proteases, in vitro proteolysis does not take place and peptides present in these controls could then be confidently assigned in the original analysis. Moreover, masses fragmented in the first round of MS/MS were excluded from subsequent rounds of MS.236 The authors realized that more than 80% of the +300 unique naturally occurring peptides identified with 99% confidence have yet unknown functions, which serves to illustrate how much there is still to discover regarding the biological roles of human endogenous peptides in biological fluids. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of the milk peptides (41 predicted AMPs) was confirmed in vivo by radial diffusion assays against the Gram\u2010negative E. coli and the Gram\u2010positive S. aureus.236 Furthermore, this study reinforced the observation that the background against which mass spectra are searched seems to be a more critical factor than the mass analyzer or the ionization technique used, when it comes to both the number of peptides identified and the confidence by which these can be assigned.",

Urine, for instance, is thought to be more stable and not to require treatment with protease inhibitors.258 However, by the time urine is collected it has already remained stagnant for considerably longer periods of time, and, hence, probably already extensively exposed to the action of proteases/peptidases inherently present in urine.

Drug design of such AMPs focuses on peptidic and nonpeptidic mimetic drugs, modulating the hydrophobicity, positivity, and amphiphilicity of endogenous AMPs to increase their antimicrobial potency. However, exploiting AMPs for therapeutic purposes is actually more complex than initially envisioned. While linear AMPs present a simpler design and a more predictable structure\u2013function relationship, circular peptides may allow the design of longer acting and more resistant AMPs.
