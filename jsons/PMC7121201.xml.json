First of all, early diagnosis of the agent is extremely important to rapidly identify the viral threat and to start the intervention as soon as possible (Memish et al. 2014). To this end, a syndromic approach and the use of an appropriate case-definition may be useful to hypothesize the nature of the disease. However, as demonstrated with Ebola in the large outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, only a small proportion of cases had hemorrhagic manifestations, thus relying on bleeding did not provide a valid clue to diagnosis. Laboratory diagnosis is more specific and represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of an emergent virus. However, in certain contexts, it may be difficult to perform relatively sophisticated tests under adverse environmental conditions. Moreover, the lack of protective equipment and high security level laboratories is an obstacle to handling potentially infected samples. To overcome this problem, mobile BSL4 labs have been extensively provided by the international community to allow Ebola virus infection diagnosis during the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.",

With diseases like Ebola, that are transmitted through direct contact with diseased persons, dead bodies, or bodily fluids, and are amplified by the family and the hospital setting or burial ceremonies, avoiding contact with physical barriers is rather efficient and productive. Measures as the availability of a large number of hospital beds to keep infected patients away from the community, protective equipment and training of health care workers to avoid direct contact with patient fluids, restriction of movements to minimize the risk of introduction of the infection to na\u00efve areas are likely to succeed when complemented by correct information, lab evidence based decision making for keeping patients under isolation, high quality care and treatment of confirmed patients.",

In this rapidly developing field of study, interdisciplinary and challenging research, performed in both industrialized and resource-limited countries, can bring critically important information for life and social sciences, for public health, and for health care overall. The aim of this special issue is to contribute to the development of knowledge on emerging infection in the endless warfare between viruses and man. However, the articles included in this volume are not representative of the whole field of emerging infections, since they have been selected with the aim of presenting a point of view on uncovered issues or providing insights on key/hot topics for which scientific knowledge is rapidly evolving knowledge. Thus, our intention was not to conduct a systematic collection of all emerging infections, but to address specific issues that may be important in order to understand why and when a new agent may emerge, and how we may intervene in an effective way. We hope we succeeded, at least in part, in this difficult task.",
