            "text": "Coronaviruses of humans have been classified as a subfamily of the Coronaviridae family. The viruses are roughly spherical, enveloped particles 120\u2013160 nm in diameter. Their name derives from the characteristic \u201ccrown\u201d-like projections on their surface, approximately 20 nm long. They are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, are sensitive to heat and lipid solvents, and have a distinct replication strategy common to other viruses in the order Nidovirales [1\u20133]. Coronaviruses have in the past been divided into three groups. In part, because of increasing work on coronavirus discovery in the wake of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a number of new coronaviruses of humans (hCoVs) have been identified. This has resulted in the three groups being reclassified as genera of the Coronavirinae subfamily. Before the SARS outbreak, while it was recognized that the coronavirus infected many different species, particularly domestic and laboratory animals, their extreme diversity in nature was not fully appreciated. Although severe diseases of differing characteristics were known to occur in animals, in humans the viruses were thought to cause only acute respiratory infection which were generally mild. All this changed with the recognition that SARS was caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This signaled that coronaviruses could produce lethal disease and encouraged more broadly based research on the agent and its prevention and control. In the process, two new respiratory or endemic coronaviruses have been identified as causing human infections, which appear to resemble in epidemiologic characteristics those previously known. Very recently, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, a novel human betacoronavirus lineage C virus, has been discovered zoonotically infecting humans in Middle Eastern countries.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses were first identified from domestic and laboratory animals before they were identified in humans. Infectious bronchitis virus of chickens was actually isolated in embryonated eggs in the 1940s. The late recognition of these viruses was, in large part, because of difficulty in recovering the human viruses using standard cell culture techniques [4]. The first human coronaviruses were identified by different techniques in the United Kingdom and the United States at approximately the same time. The British Medical Research Council\u2019s Common Cold Research Unit had been studying fluids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers. Rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the fluids [5]. There was an additional, substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but that could still cause colds in the volunteers. Organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort to detect the recalcitrant viruses present. A specimen, B814, that had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture. After the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture, it could still cause colds on inoculation into volunteers, which indicated that replication had taken place [6]. In Chicago during the winter of 1962, five agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds. The viruses were ultimately adapted to WI-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect (CPE) not previously seen. A prototype strain, 229E, was selected for characterization and was found to be RNA containing, ether labile, and 89 nm in diameter but distinct serologically from any known ortho- or paramyxoviruses. Sera collected from the five medical students all exhibited a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer against 229E [7]. It became clear that these \u201cnovel\u201d viruses were of more than passing significance when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Six viruses were found that grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile; on electron microscopy, the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in structure, and these represented a distinct family of viruses [8]. The B814 and 229E strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles [9, 10]. As a result of the similarity of the human agents to IBV and also to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally [11]. The name coronavirus was eventually adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen around them on electron microscopy [1]. Except for 229E, none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture. McIntosh et al. reported successful adaptation of two of the NIH isolates, OC (organ culture) 38 and OC43, to the brains of suckling mice [12]. These strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from MHV. Only OC38 and OC43 could be so adapted; the other four OC strains resisted such attempts. The IBV was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions, but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until OC38 and OC43 were adapted to mice. Kaye and Dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly and specifically agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens, rats, and mice [13]. This technique greatly expanded the ability to do seroepidemiologic studies, since it was simple and reproducible.",

            "text": "Work on the coronaviruses of humans proceeded slowly, with debate about how frequently the viruses caused lower rather than upper respiratory disease. The methodological problems of working with them were a major impediment, as was their apparent involvement only in a relatively mild disease. All this changed when in 2002 SARS appeared first in China and then in other countries of the world. The near panic resulted because of its transmission characteristics, case fatality, and the fact that the agent was initially unknown. That last aspect was solved quickly with the identification of the causative agent as a new coronavirus. The knowledge that the virus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir spurred investigation of its possible source. Small mammals (civet cats) in live game-animal markets in Guangdong were identified carrying closely related viruses. This led to the identification of these animals as amplifier hosts and to the game-animal wet markets as an interface where zoonotic infection of humans was being initiated [15]. The natural reservoir was later identified to be Chinese horseshoe bats [16, 17]. The SARS epidemic ended following the use of various population control measures and unexpectedly has not recurred. However, increased attention to the coronaviruses continued globally. New coronaviruses were identified in various animal hosts, and two additional coronaviruses were identified in humans, the first since 229E and OC43. NL63 was identified in Amsterdam in 2004 from a 7-month-old child with febrile bronchiolitis [18]. The same virus was also isolated at almost the same time by the group in Rotterdam from an 8-month-old child with pneumonia [19]. The second virus, HKU1, was detected in a specimen collected from a 71-year-old man from China with pneumonia and then from another adult with the same diagnosis [20]. With the development of real-time PCR techniques for all four human respiratory coronaviruses, it has now become possible to identify them in many situations. Such identification is now typically done not only for these viruses but also for a variety of other respiratory agents. This has meant that coronaviruses are now detected as much in clinical settings as in epidemiologic studies.",

This was in contrast to the situation in animals, where infections were sometimes fatal, depending on the particular virus. Since the SARS episode, the major change which has affected data on the respiratory coronaviruses has been more ready detection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, so that infections are now recognized in those who might previously have not been studied. This has especially been the case in hospitalized individuals, particularly those who will likely experience severe outcomes, such as the immunocompromised. It is also known from earlier studies that coronavirus frequently infects small children and reinfects adults, including persons with chronic respiratory disease [21]. It would be logical to assume that deaths could occur in these most susceptible segments of the population, but they are probably not very frequent.",

            "text": "Since the coronaviruses of humans, other than the SARS virus, usually produce illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by other respiratory viruses, it is not possible to define morbidity in the absence of laboratory identification. Before PCR became available, it was difficult directly to identify the infecting virus; thus, besides anecdotal reports, most of the epidemiologic studies were based on identifying rises in antibody titer. In contrast, since development of the PCR technique, direct identification has become relatively simple. However, this seeming advance has often been accompanied by the use of the method to determine the incidence of infection in population groups and to define characteristics of associated disease or even seasonality. The major problem is the short duration of many of the available studies and the concentration on hospitalized individuals. As a result, while it is possible to say these viruses can sometimes cause hospitalization and to infer the particular clinical diagnoses they produce, it is difficult to estimate what proportion of overall illnesses are severe. A small number of studies have been population based and have produced the only data available for determining the overall impact of illness [22\u201324]. While the older population-based studies were limited to 229E, OC43, or both, they are useful since there are few recent investigations that give the same information. They were conducted in different settings but in some cases contemporaneously which allows direct comparison. In fact, almost no studies include all four recognized coronaviruses and cover more than a single year. This makes it difficult to discuss year-to-year variation in frequency of activity as well as seasonality, as was possible with the older data. Such studies are therefore of continuing interest, at least as background, in determining the long-term occurrence of the viruses. These original investigations were typically broadly based, with coronavirus infection forming part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses. As indicated in the selected listing in Table 10.1, a variety of different open and closed populations were used for these studies. The 229E strain was originally isolated from medical students in Chicago as part of a long-term study of respiratory illnesses in young adults [7, 25]. Employee groups were the source of specimens in the NIH [26, 27] and in the studies at Charlottesville, Virginia [30]. Infection was also evaluated in children\u2019s homes [28] and boarding schools [5], among military recruits [34], and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world [26]. Serological methods were used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma [33] or chronic obstructive respiratory disease [21]. Patterns of coronavirus infection were identified among the general population residing in the Tecumseh, Michigan, community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness [31, 32]. Also included in Table 10.1 are more recent studies using PCR to identify infection. The previous studies, based on serology, often did not characterize infections identified clinically; in fact, challenge studies of volunteers were employed early, to determine characteristics of illnesses, because of problems associated with direct isolation [35, 36]. The more recent studies were able to characterize the illnesses clinically but have other limitations as indicated above.\n",

            "text": "Relatively simple serological technique was available for the first two coronaviruses identified (229E and OC43), and surveys of antibody prevalence were carried out in various parts of the world. Many surveys formed a part of studies directed mainly toward determination of incidence of infection. Information on the prevalence of antibody was available for populations in the United States [27, 30, 31], the United Kingdom [36], Brazil [37], and other parts of the world. A special situation was determining the meaning of the presence in man of antibody against coronaviruses of animals. The finding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when first described in 1964 [38]. It is now recognized that this did not indicate past experience with MHV but rather with human coronavirus strains known to cross-react with it. Similarly, antibodies in human sera against the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine and the coronavirus of calf diarrhea also appear to represent cross-reactions with OC43 or related strains [29, 39]. In contrast, in a survey of antibodies to avian IBV, none could be found in a military population. Low-level antibodies were detected only in a portion of subjects who had close contact with poultry [40]. The virus is not known to cross-react with the human strains. More recently, following a gap in active work on the epidemiology of coronaviruses, ELISA methods have been developed for at least some of the viruses [41, 42]. These have not been as much used as the older techniques, given the availability of PCR, and may not be as specific to the particular strain.",

The human coronavirus 229E was originally isolated in cell culture and later adapted to roller culture monolayers of human embryonic lung fibroblast cells such as WI-38 and MRC-5. A cytopathic effect of small, granular, round cells appears at the periphery of the cell monolayer [7]. Although these cells can be used for the cell-adapted prototype 229E virus strain, primary isolation of new 229E-like agents remains difficult. The human embryonic intestine (MA177) semicontinuous cell line has been used for the primary isolation of other 229E-like viruses [26]. Human coronaviruses OC38 and OC43, not related to 229E, were originally isolated in organ cultures of human trachea or lung [6, 8, 43, 44]. These two strains are similar and have been further adapted to replicate in suckling mouse brain and to primary monkey kidney and BS-C-1 cell cultures [9, 12, 14]. Another cell system, LI32, a heteroploid human lung line, has been reported to be suitable for primary isolation of 229E, a related virus (LP), and the B814, the first-described organ culture agent [45, 46]. This last finding has not been confirmed by other workers [9]. Similarly, MRC-C cells have been used for 229E-like viruses and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells for propagating 229E and OC43 [47, 48].",

The elicited antibodies detected by ELISA predominantly react with the viral surface proteins rather than the ribonucleoprotein [85], and infections of 229E- and OC43-like viruses can be distinguished in ELISA assays [86]. ELISA has been used to study the seroprevalence of HKU1, showing an increase from 0 % in age <10 years old to a plateau of 21.6 % in the age group of 31\u201340 years old [87]. Recombinant protein-based ELISA assays for detecting antibody to SARS-CoV have been developed [88, 89]. The duration of antibodies by ELISA to the SARS-CoV spike protein was long-lived and paralleled neutralizing antibody responses, while those to the nucleoprotein was less long-lived [90].",

Paired sera from confirmed OC43 or 229E infections and 49 convalescent sera from SARS patients showed that there was considerable cross-reactivity between the two betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 and between the two alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63. However, 229E- or OC43-infected patients did not develop cross-reactive antibody to SARS-CoV. It is important to keep in mind such cross-reactions when evaluating the results of serological assays. It is also relevant that immunofluorescent assays appear to manifest the greatest cross-reactivity. Neutralization tests are likely to be the most specific although this has not been systematically studied with the recently discovered coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Historically CF or HI tests were used in epidemiologic studies of coronaviruses [7]. By this method, the CF test detected antibody in low titer and for only a short time after infection. However, if the antigen was highly concentrated, antibody could be detected at a higher titer, and this antibody persisted in the population so that the CF method could be employed in surveys of prevalence [92]. An indirect HI test for 229E virus using tanned sheep erythrocytes has been described which appears to be highly sensitive with no cross-reactions with OC43 virus [93]. CF tests can be satisfactorily performed with OC43 virus using infected suckling mouse brain as antigen [27]. The same mouse brain material can also be used in the HI test for OC43 antibody. In this test, the hemagglutination titer has been higher for rat than for chicken erythrocytes but sufficient with the chicken cells so that HI testing could generally be employed; this is of particular importance in view of the wider availability of chicken erythrocytes and the spontaneous agglutination that often complicates working with rat erythrocytes. Serum to be tested did not require treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme but rather standard heat inactivation at 56 \u00b0C. The agglutination took place equally at various temperatures including room temperature [94]. It has also been possible to demonstrate precipitin lines on gel-diffusion tests with coronavirus antigens concentrated 10- to 50-fold. Two or three precipitin lines were observed by Bradburne [92] in tests with hyperimmune animal or human serum, but others have identified only one such line [94].",

Cross-reactive antibody responses among hCoVs have been reported. When sera from individuals experimentally infected with 229E- and OC43-like coronaviruses, including organ culture viruses, were tested, they are found to cross-react within each group but not across groups. Thus, it is possible that the ELISA test with 229E and OC43 antigens may be able to detect infection with most, if not all, human 229E and OC43 coronaviruses [86]. However, persons with antibody to 229E and OC43 (most of the adult population) did not have cross-reacting antibody to SARS-CoV even in immunofluorescent tests, allowing these serological tests to be reliably used for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of SARS. Patients who had OC43 infections without prior exposure to SARS-CoV had increases of antibodies specific for the infecting OC43 virus but not to SARS-CoV. However, antibody responses to SARS-CoV antibody were sometimes associated with an increase in preexisting IgG antibody titers for human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63 by immunofluorescent assays. This probably reflects anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses to coronaviruses to which the patient has had prior exposure (i.e., similar to the concept of \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d) [96, 97]. The cross-reactivity is less when purifying nucleocapsid proteins are used in ELISA or Western blot assays.",

Following entry into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and uncoating of the virus genome, ORF1a/b of the genome is first translated to generate replicase proteins. These replicases use the positive viral genome as the template to generate full-length negative-sense RNAs, which in turn serve as templates for generating additional full-length genomes (i.e., replication). In viral protein synthesis, the 3\u2032 proximal genes of the viral genome are first transcribed to segmented subgenomic negative-sense RNAs by discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis. The process is initiated at the 3\u2032 end of the genome and proceeds until they encounter one of the transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) that reside upstream (5\u2032) of most ORFs. Through base-pairing interactions, the nascent transcript is transferred to the complementary leader TRS, and transcription continues through the 5\u2032 end of the genome. Therefore, all mRNAs of a coronavirus characteristically contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence fused to a downstream gene sequence. These subgenomic RNAs then serve as templates for positive-sense mRNA production and subsequent translation into viral proteins [101].",

            "text": "Three structural proteins S, E, and M are found on the viral lipid-membrane envelope; these are acquired as the virus buds into the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment, and/or Golgi complex of the host cell [98]. The spike protein (S) is a large homotrimeric type I membrane glycoprotein (1,128\u20131,472 aa). The S protein carries the receptor binding domain and is a class I fusion protein that triggers fusion between viral and host cell membranes within the endocytic vesicle, thereby releasing the genome into the cytoplasm. The envelope protein (E) is a pentameric integral membrane protein (74\u2013109 aa) that acts as ion channel for preferential transport of different ions into the virion. Although present in low copy number in a virion, E is significantly involved in virus budding, morphogenesis, and intracellular trafficking [102]. The membrane protein (M) is an integral type III triple-spanning membrane protein (218\u2013263 aa). Being the most abundant protein in the viral envelope, it is essential in virus assembly within the infected cell. It could also interfere with host immune responses by inhibiting type I interferon production [103, 104]. The nucleocapsid protein (N) is a phosphoprotein that encapsidates the RNA viral genome to form ribonucleoprotein complex and regulates viral replication and translation (349\u2013470 aa). It has RNA chaperone activity and also functions as an interferon antagonist [105]. In addition to these, the group A betacoronaviruses (includes OC43/HECV and HKU1) express an extra accessory homodimeric type I envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin esterase (HE), on its surface. It is related to subunit 1 of the influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) and mediates reversible virion attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids [106].",

There was marked year-to-year variation in infection frequency, ranging from a high of 35 % of those tested in 1966\u20131967 to a low of 1 % in 1964\u20131965.

As with the study in Chicago, routine blood specimens were collected so that infection rates could be determined; however, the study group was composed of individuals of all ages living in their homes. Over the 2 years, infections were detected in 7.7 % of individuals tested by CF, as shown in the curve in Fig. 10.3. However, this appeared to be an underestimate of the actual activity of the virus. Serum specimens had been collected on a regular basis, 6 months apart; rises in titer by CF occurred most frequently in those pairs in which the second specimen was collected in April 1967, clearly indicating the peak period of viral dissemination. Both CF and the more sensitive N test results were combined to give an overall infection rate for the population studied; this rate, 34 %, was remarkably similar to the 35 % observed in Chicago at the same time. Because of the limited period of viral activity, it was possible to compare illness rates of those infected with persons not infected matched by age and sex; it was estimated that 45 % of the infections had produced clinical disease. Thus, the rate of 229E-associated illnesses during the outbreak was 15 per 100 persons studied. Activity in all age groups was apparent, including those under 25 years of age [31].\n\n",

Employees at State Farm Insurance Company, in Charlottesville, Virginia, were studied during an 8-year period for rises in titer for both 229E and OC43. By CF, 229E infection could be related to 3 % of the colds that occurred in the winter\u2013spring and to 0.4 % of colds that occurred in the summer\u2013fall. There was some year-to-year variation in activity, but differences in the number of specimens tested from various years did not permit complete identification of cyclical patterns [30]. Employees of the NIH with respiratory illness were studied by both isolation and serology for 229E infection over a 6-year period. Again, attention was specifically directed toward certain segments of the 6 years, and no specimens were tested during other segments. Of particular interest once more is the segment from December 1966 to April 1967. Isolation of rhinoviruses and myxoviruses was uncommon at this time, but respiratory illness continued to occur. During this period, 24 % of those persons with colds studied had rises in titer for 229E. As part of the same investigation, paired blood specimens collected from infants and children admitted to the hospital with acute lower respiratory disease during the 1967 period of 229E activity were tested for rise in antibody against the virus, but none was found [26, 27]. Healthy children institutionalized in Atlanta, Georgia, were studied from 1960 to 1968; antibody response to 229E was determined by the indirect hemagglutination test. The investigation involved collection of serum specimens related to illness and also routine collection of sera from some non-ill individuals. Frequency of infection showed marked variation from year to year. Overall, 4 % of colds could be associated with 229E infection, with greatest association in autumn, winter, and spring [28]. A more recent study took advantage of specimens sent from medical facilities in Edinburgh, Scotland, for laboratory identification of infection to study the incidence of a number of respiratory viruses identified by PCR. Overall, 229E was found in only 0.3 % of those sampled, lowest of any of the four coronaviruses studied. This may reflect that the source of the specimens was from illnesses seen in hospitals and primary care facilities, and coronaviruses are mainly involved in milder illnesses [22].",

Individual sera from normal healthy adults collected serially in Britain from 1965 to 1970 were tested by Bradburne and Somerset. It is of interest that the proportion of sera positive by CF increased from approximately 17 % in specimens collected in October\u2013December 1966 to 62 % in those collected in July\u2013September 1967.

Infections with the agent were detected in all years of the study, but with definite cyclical variation. Seasons most involved were the winter and spring.

Interestingly, testing of the sera collected routinely from non-ill individuals indicated that an additional equal number of OC43 infections were occurring without the production of symptoms [107]. The Charlottesville study of adult employees was of both OC43 and 229E infections.

Testing of sera collected from these employees indicated that during this period, up to 29 % of the colds studied were accompanied by rise in titer for OC43. In the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease, up to 10 % of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise. However, it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic. This finding was in contrast to that seen with 229E, in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases [27, 111]. In the Tecumseh study, occurrence of OC43 infection was determined in the community population over a 4-year period: CF and HI tests were used on all specimens, and N tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens. During the total period, OC43-related infection was detected in 17.1 % of the 910 persons studied for 1 year. Most of the infections took place in the winter\u2013spring months of 1965\u20131966, 1967\u20131968, and 1968\u20131969. The only winter\u2013spring period without such activity was in 1966\u20131967, when the 229E outbreak had taken place. The 1968\u20131969 outbreak of OC43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229E outbreak, with 25.6 % of the population studied showing evidence of infection. Of special note was the fact that children under 5 years of age had the highest infection rates [32, 112]. More recently, in the Edinburgh study involving medical care, OC43 was the most commonly identified coronavirus but only was identified by PCR in 0.85 % of specimens. This again may be a reflection of the source of the specimens. Surveys of antibody prevalence have been conducted in several settings using OC43 antigens. McIntosh et al. [27] found that children began to acquire antibody to this virus in the first year of life. By the third year of life, more than 50 % had antibody present. Among adults, 69 % could be demonstrated to have antibody; this indicates, in view of the high incidence of infection with the agents in all age groups, the frequency with which such infections must represent reinfection. The high prevalence of antibody has been confirmed in other studies [28, 30, 112]. In Britain, Bradburne and Somerset followed prevalence of antibody for OC43 over time, as they also had done with 229E [36]. Each year, the greatest prevalence of antibody was found in the winter\u2013spring period. The single highest point in antibody prevalence was in January\u2013March 1969, at the same time the OC43 outbreak was occurring in some parts of the United States [30, 38].",

In earlier studies, in the United States, in addition to the studies listed in the first part of Table 10.1, a 229E-like virus was isolated in California, and OC43 and 229E have been demonstrated to be present in many regions of the country [21, 113]. Extensive studies have been carried out by the Common Cold Research Unit, which have demonstrated the presence of the agents in Britain. The activity of 229E virus has been documented in Brazil in an early study of children and adults with and without respiratory illness. Significant rises in antibody titer accompanied respiratory infection in the nonhospitalized children. Prevalence of antibody was determined by CF, and like the situation in some studies in the north temperate zone, children had little antibody, whereas 26 % of adults were antibody positive [37]. Later investigations have confirmed the worldwide distribution of these agents [112, 114]. In particular, the widespread use of PCR has now allowed easy documentation of the activity of all the coronaviruses. In fact, one of the four viruses now recognized, HKU1, was first identified in the subtropical city of Hong Kong [20]. These findings suggest that coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution and cause similar types of illness in different localities [115], as has been noted with many other respiratory viruses [116, 117].",

In early epidemiologic studies, there was, however, evidence of variation in the frequency of infection on both a seasonal and a cyclical basis. In these investigations, isolation and rises in antibody titer for all types of coronaviruses were rare events outside the period from December through May. This is the portion of the year in which isolation rates for rhinoviruses often reach their lowest level. An exception to this rule was a study in which frequent rises in titer were detected by ELISA in summer as well [84]. More recent studies identifying the viruses by PCR have largely confirmed the winter seasonality of the viruses in the north temperate zone; one study observed that the timing of coronavirus identifications was similar to that of influenza in winter\u2013early spring [22]. As expected, the seasonality appears to differ in places like Hong Kong, based on accumulating data [121].",

In all studies, some sporadic activity did occur in nearly all years studied, but rises in antibody titers were concentrated in certain years in which they far exceeded the means for the entire studies. Those periods are indicated as solid black boxes in the figure. The times during which specimens were collected in each investigation are indicated in the figure by the white boxes. Activity of 229E was detected in all four studies at the same time, even though two were in the Midwest and two in the eastern United States. It seems possible, on the basis of these data, to postulate a 2- to 3-year cycle for this agent. The greatest number of infections in Chicago was seen in 1967, after the absence of the agent for 3 years; that pattern suggests a role of herd immunity in determining the time of reappearance of the agent.\n\n",

However, it is unclear whether the drop-off is modest or more extreme, as is the case with respiratory syncytial virus [124]. In the Tecumseh study, a total population group was followed. During the 1968\u20131969 OC43 outbreak, infection rates were relatively uniform for all age groups, varying from a high of 29.2 per 100 person-years in the 0\u20134 age group to 22.2 in those over 40 years of age [32]. The reversal of the pattern of age-specific infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229E. Infection with this virus has been more difficult to demonstrate in small children than in adults. In Tecumseh, during the 1966\u20131967 outbreak, highest age-specific infection rates by CF were found among those 15\u201329 years of age, following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0- to 4-year-olds. However, when neutralization tests were used to detect infection, the 15- to 19-year-olds still had high infection rates, but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep [31]. This suggests that the apparent sparing of small children with 229E may be an artifact resulting from the relative insensitivity of the young to the serological procedures commonly employed. It would be surprising if two different coronavirus serotypes behaved so differently [125].",

Similarly, female volunteers appeared to be more susceptible to infection with 229E-like strains than males in artificial challenge studies [127]. In the study by Candeias et al. of antibody prevalence, the results were examined by sex, but no significant differences could be observed [43]. There are no data available on occupational or racial susceptibility to infection or on the role of socioeconomic status in influencing rates. Occurrence of infection in closed or special populations, such as military recruits or residents of children\u2019s institutions, has been reported [5, 26, 34]. The role of the school-age child in dissemination of coronavirus has not yet been clearly defined, but it would be surprising if these infections differed in their transmission pattern so markedly from that documented with the other agents. Because of the high frequency of infection in older children and adults, other sites of dissemination may also be of significance. It has been possible to show that the family unit is of importance in transmission, since clustering of 229E and OC43 infections in families was observed in the Tecumseh and Seattle studies [31, 128].",

Such a finding is hardly surprising in view of the high infection rates that have been observed in unselected older adults [129]. It has not yet been demonstrated whether this represents true increased susceptibility to infection or simply a more severe form of expression of the infection when it occurs in an already compromised host. In addition to the situation in older individuals, there is evidence that both OC43 and 229E may trigger acute attacks of wheezing in young asthmatics; in fact, in one study, coronaviruses were the most common agent involved in episodes of wheezy bronchitis [21, 33, 117, 130]. Recent studies using the PCR technique also associate the viruses with illnesses including pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [63, 115, 131]. One study identified all the viruses over the course of a year but the newer viruses, NL63 and HKU1, most commonly. Again, this may be a reflection of these viruses being most common at that point in time; it should be noted that shortly after the first identification of NL63 in one city in the Netherlands, it was again identified in another, which may indicate increased circulation at the time [18, 132].",

For example, on March 25, the World Health Organization reported the case fatality risk to be around 4 %, based on 49 deaths among more than 1,000 cases at that time [161]. This estimate was erroneously low because cases had not yet recovered, and some cases would subsequently succumb to the disease [160]. After the epidemic, the case fatality risk was estimated to be 9.6 % with 744 deaths among the 8,096 probable cases [135]. However, this masks substantial variability between affected regions, from around 7 % in Beijing to around 17 % in Hong Kong [150]. Reasons for variation remain unclear but could partly be attributed to case definitions, partly to case mix including age and underlying heath conditions [150] and partly to case management [162].",

The importance of strict infection control was illustrated particularly well by the experiences in Taiwan and Toronto, where control of the initial outbreaks was followed by complacency and subsequent second waves [167, 168]. Despite the importance of infection control strategies, there are also examples of individuals with SARS who were hospitalized where infection control practices were lax and yet their infection did not result in outbreaks [169].

It has been possible to induce infection experimentally in volunteers by inoculating virus into the nose [35, 44]. The virus is most stable at pH 6.0, and low temperature appears to protect it against varied relative humidity [171, 172]. No other route of transmission for coronaviruses seems involved in man, although animal coronaviruses are infectious by the fecal\u2013oral route [57]. There is currently no direct evidence to aid in identifying the main mechanisms of transmission. However, it is possible to compare the epidemiologic behavior of the coronaviruses with that of other respiratory agents, the transmission mechanisms of which have been more directly studied. Large-scale outbreaks of coronavirus infections have taken place, as in Tecumseh in 1967 [31]. This is much more analogous to the situation seen with influenza than to that with the rhinoviruses [173]. Rhinoviruses are thought to be transmitted by large droplet and may at times spread via fomites [174].",

SARS coronavirus was capable of surviving on dried, inert surfaces and was found on some hospital surfaces [177], and indirect contact was implied in the infections of some nonmedical staff [178]. Although there is substantial evidence to support the role of transmission through droplet and direct contact and some evidence to support transmission by indirect contact, there is relatively little evidence for airborne transmission [179]. In one large community outbreak in Hong Kong, a computational fluid dynamics model was used to demonstrate that airborne transmission was consistent with the observed pattern of infections [180], although this hypothesis was not formally compared with other possible explanations. However, lacking other evidence of airborne transmission despite unprotected extended exposures in health-care settings [169, 181, 182], the World Health Organization classified SARS as a disease with \u201copportunistic airborne\u201d transmission to indicate that the disease naturally spreads by non-airborne routes but under special environmental conditions may spread by the airborne route [183, 184]. Diseases that are spread by opportunistic airborne transmission do not require special airborne infection isolation measures, for example, negative-pressure isolation rooms, but special precautions are recommended for high-risk procedures.",

Epidemiologic studies also have demonstrated association of 229E infection with disease. During the 1967 outbreak of 229E infection in Tecumseh, Michigan, illness was significantly more common among those with infection than among matched subjects without infection [31]. Similarly, 229E infection among Chicago medical students was statistically associated with illness when those with rises in titer were used as their own controls [25]. Furthermore, experimental inoculation of volunteers with strains of 229E and OC43 isolated in the laboratory has resulted in clinical illness, fulfilling Koch\u2019s postulates modified by Rivers [185] for attributing an etiologic role to a microbe as a cause of disease [35, 36, 47].",

In the Tecumseh study, 81.5 % of those infected with OC43 actually possessed prior N antibody [189]. Possession of circulating OC43 HI antibody among the Atlanta children did not appear to play a role in modifying severity of a subsequent illness [28]. With 229E virus, Hamre and Beem [25] demonstrated that the frequency of rise in titer detected by N was inversely proportional to preinfection levels of N antibody, which would indicate that this antibody exerted some protective effect. However, the importance of this N antibody could not be confirmed when infection was detected by CF. Thus, circulating N antibody as measured at present may bear a relationship to modification of infection, but this association is not a very strong one. Since coronavirus infections involve mainly the surface of the respiratory tract, it is likely that secretory IgA antibody plays a more direct role in protection; this had in fact been demonstrated with a swine coronavirus [190] and subsequently with 229E in humans experimentally infected [191].",

Coronaviruses have a wide spectrum of susceptible host cell range, determined by the expression of the relevant receptors (Table 10.3). Related coronaviruses may use the same or similar receptors for entry, and major receptors for hCoVs include aminopeptidase (APN) and ACE2. Most alphacoronaviruses bind to APN with the exception of NL63 and SARS-CoV which binds to ACE2. Some of the betacoronaviruses (including OC43) attach to 4- or 9-O-acetylated sialic acids via the virus S and HE proteins. The HE protein also has enzymatic activity to cleave sialic acid linkages and thus serves to release virus from infected cells after replication is completed. Some human coronaviruses have other binding receptors that allow virus attachment to host cells, but these are not sufficient as functional receptors to mediate viral entry by themselves. These include calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins such as L-SIGN (liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin), which may serve as a receptor for 229E and SARS [202, 203]. Recognition of a receptor from the same family in another host species is possible and may allow cross-species transmission. For example, 229E can use either human or feline APN but not porcine APN [201], and human and palm civet ACE2 serve as receptors for epidemic strains of SARS-CoV, but mouse and rat ACE2 do not [204, 205].\n",

In studies involving volunteers, the mean period from inoculation of virus to development of symptoms was from 3.2 to 3.5 days, depending on the strain (range, 2\u20134 days) [35, 44]. Following exposure, the virus apparently multiplies superficially in the respiratory tract in a manner similar to that in which multiplication occurs in vitro. Nasal airway resistance and temperature of the nasal mucosa increase [213]. Virus excretion usually reaches a detectable level at the time symptoms begin and lasts for 1\u20134 days. The duration of the illness is from 6 to 7 days on the average but with some lasting up to 18 days. Serological response either to induced or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serological test employed. For example, among those experimentally infected with OC38 or OC43 virus who had a cold produced, only 46 % had rises in titer by HI and 23 % by CF. Fewer than half of those infected with 229E showed a CF rise. It is not clear how the existence of titer or preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests. Rises in N antibody titer are easier to detect and have been found with sensitive techniques in all volunteers experimentally infected [36, 92]. The use of the ELISA test has given added sensitivity in antibody detection; it is not as yet clear if decreased specificity should be a concern.",

They have also been reported to cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory infections, such as croup and bronchiolitis [115, 123, 214]. Most of the evidence of their involvement in severe disease comes from reports from hospitals of the identification of the viruses by PCR. It is thus impossible to say what proportion of infections, which appear to be common, that result in hospitalization are in fact caused by these viruses. Another problem recently encountered is the frequent identification by PCR of other viruses in those in whom a coronavirus is found [22]. This complicates determining the primary etiology. In induced infections in volunteers, the most prominent findings have been coryza and nasal discharge, with the discharge being more profuse than that customarily seen with rhinovirus colds [35]. Sore throat has been somewhat less common and in children has been associated with pharyngeal injection [215]. Experimental colds caused by B814 virus were about as severe as those caused by 229E; however, natural OC43 infections caused illnesses with considerably more cough and sore throat than did 229E infections [216]. The mean duration of coronavirus colds, at 6.5 days, was shorter than that seen in rhinovirus colds, at 9.5 days [35].",

Previously, because of the difficulty in growing them in cell culture, epidemiologic and clinical studies had to rely on serology. While less limiting in epidemiologic studies, where regular blood collections can be scheduled, it sharply constrained the ability to identify the role of hCoVs in causing severe respiratory infections. Now we recognize the existence of four different coronaviruses, and there may be more that have not yet been identified. Paradoxically, the situation has now been reversed; there are many reports on the involvement of these agents in hospitalized cases, but epidemiologic studies involving all four hCoVs in different populations over time have been relatively scarce. It was previously thought that the viruses cycle in their appearance over a period of years, but recent evidence is lacking, especially pertaining to the newly identified viruses, NL63 and HKU1; however, there are still data suggesting that, in the temperate zones, the viruses are most active in late winter\u2013spring. Ironically, with the PCR technique, it has become common to identify more than one virus from the same individual. This is not limited to the coronaviruses but includes many other respiratory viruses as well. There is a need to determine whether these are true coinfections or whether there may be asymptomatic or prolonged carriage involved. If they are real coinfections, there may be consequences of having more than one agent present during an illness.",

However, in a large number of human cases, there appears to be no record of a history of contact with camels. The dromedary MERS-CoV virus appears genetically identical to those infecting humans, but abattoir workers with repeated exposure to potentially infected animals have little serological evidence of infection [223]. The geographic distribution of MERS-CoV infection in camels (including North East Africa) is wider than that reported in primary human cases reported so far. It remains to be seen whether this represents under-recognition of human cases in a wider geographic area. MERS-CoV antibodies have been detected in archived dromedary sera collected over two decades ago [226], and this may indicate that MERS is a recently recognised, rather than a newly emerging, disease.
