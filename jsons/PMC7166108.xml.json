            "text": "Care for patients during COVID-19 poses challenges that require the protection and safety of staff. High risk of exposure to healthcare workers occurs with direct contact with respiratory droplets. Formal recommendations have been issued by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) recommending that health care workers wear at minimum, an N95 mask or equivalent while performing an aerosol-generating procedure with a face shield. A powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) provides superior protection and may be warranted in patients with known or suspected COVID-19. PAPRs pull air through a HEPA filter (N95 grade or better) into a suit to create positive pressure with air always flowing out so that the person in the suit only receives filtered air, thus minimizing exposure to the person in the suit. Risk of aerosolization is greatest during intubation. In addition, specific surgeries and procedures that involve the nasopharynx/oropharynx may carry similar risk to surgeons and other staff in the operating room. Amid this, the United States faces shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) [1]. In addition, surgeons who use loupes and headlights have difficulty using these in conjunction with face shields. Most hospitals have a limited number of dedicated PAPR units posing a significant constraint when caring for multiple patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Most arthroplasty surgeons use surgical helmet systems in efforts to decrease the patient\u2019s risk of surgical infection and to protect surgical staff from infectious blood splashes/debris; with some studies questioning the capacity surgical helmet systems to decrease contamination or deep infection [2, 3, 4]. In the current pandemic, many hospitals have delayed elective arthroplasty surgeries and the helmet systems are going unused.",

            "text": "This scenario of need for PPE and helmets not being used led the authors to initiate an effort to retrofit the Stryker Flyte helmets (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) at our institution. This helmet system (Figure 1\n) covers the entire head and neck. The system is designed to pull air in through the top of the hood through a white section of AAMI Class 3 material. The air then passes through the blue AAMI Class 4 material on the sides of the hood. A fan mounted in the top of the helmet drives this flow. While Class 4 material provides the highest level of protection against pathogens [5], the Class 3 material may allow some pathogens to pass through. Helmet systems were used in conjunction with goggles and N95 masks during the 2003 SARS outbreak as using the helmet systems alone did not filter enough particles (0.02-1\u03bcm diameter) to meet the standard for PAPRs [6]. While this system is not intended as a respirator, a novel solution has been proposed with adaptation of the standard helmet system given the shortage of PAPRs and potential shortage of N95 masks. The concept developed at our institution was to use a 3D printing approach to create an adaptor for the Flyte helmet to allow conversion to a protective PPE.",

            "text": "This effort was initiated on (03/20/2020) after the lead author (MME) noted that these unused helmets represented a possible solution to PPE shortage for high risk scenarios (Figure 2\n). Helmet modification, assembly, and quality testing was performed in collaboration with the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering. At the core of this modification is a single new component, the manifold. The manifold sits over the (previously open) intake fan and creates a sealed air path directly to the two mounted filters. The manifold is created from a Duke design that is then 3D printed (additive manufacturing) to arrive at the final component. We used Formlabs printers and their \u2018Durable\u2019 material for this new part. The engineering team worked to quickly design a robust manifold by using 3D printing (Figure 3\n). The first single-port design was created on 3/22/2020 (Figure 4\n). The single-port design had insufficient flow and choking at the fan but proved the concept, so we went to a two-port design on 3/24/2020 (Figure 5\n). After some user testing in the hospital we realized we needed to angle the ports down to better accommodate the hood and the design was updated on 3/26/2020 (Figure 6\n). Then we optimized the flow path and sealing area on 3/28/2020 (Figure 7\n). Next, we moved the ports outwards to allow for the rectangular Pall BB50T filter which provided enhanced performance on 4/2/2020 (Figure 8\n).",

It is important to create the seal on the inside of the hood which can be confirmed by locating the exposed seam side (Figure 12\n). Two 8x12 inch 3M Tegaderm \u2122 strips or multiple 4x10 inch strips can be used for this. The strips must cover the seams and overlap with each other to ensure an adequate seal. In addition, this is done on the inside as a safety measure so that positive air flow inside the hood pushes the strips up against the Class 3 material.",
