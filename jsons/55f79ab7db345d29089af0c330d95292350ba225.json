Most cases of respiratory viral infections are asymptomatic or relatively mild, causing minor illness before the patient fully recovers. Serious illness can develop, especially among certain high-risk groups, leading to hospitalization, worsening of chronic conditions, and even death. In between are cases of moderate to severe respiratory tract infections in which patients seek outpatient medical attention, referred to as medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). These infections frequently result in lost productivity in the form of work or school absenteeism or reduced productivity due to attendance at work or school while sick (presenteeism).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The most common viruses associated with respiratory tract infections are human adenovirus (ADNO), human coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus (influenza), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These viral pathogens vary in their pathogenesis, epidemiology, and temporal appearance throughout the year, but typically share a common set of symptoms including cough, fever, and rhinorrhea. Among the many viral ARIs seen in primary care each year, only a portion has been routinely tested to determine the offending organism because (i) rapid testing to differentiate among viruses is not readily available, and (ii) available treatments for most respiratory viruses are chiefly palliative, with the exception being antivirals for treatment of influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "New assay methods using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) are becoming available that allow for relatively rapid detection of multiple virus types.

That study used singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) to detect influenza virus. The University of Pittsburgh site of the Flu VE Network also used MRT-PCR. The purposes of this study were to (i) compare the agreement between SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR for influenza virus detection; (ii) examine the distribution of viruses associated with ARI visits during January through April 2012 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using MRT-PCR; and (iii) compare personal characteristics and symptoms among those infected with various viruses.

For instance, hMPV, RSV, and influenza are more common among young children and older adults 12 than among younger adults.
