Medical personnel protection is a priority as in their case, infection or even the need for quarantine may pose a real threat to patients.",

Emergency physicians, anesthesiologists and intensive care specialists, as well as the relevant scientific societies issue recommendations concerning endotracheal intubation or other procedures dangerous for the medical personnel [1,2]. It should be remembered that endotracheal intubation by using direct laryngoscopy without adequate protection presents a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed modifications of endotracheal intubation include special preparation of the equipment and medical personnel, using a special protective box, foils applied to the upper half of the patient's body, and the use of indirect laryngoscopy methods, including video laryngoscopy and rapid sequence intubation [8,9]. In this context, it should be emphasized that attempts of prehospital endotracheal intubation by inexperienced personnel constitute a challenge, and supraglottic methods should be kept in mind. If intravenous access cannot be established or is technically difficult, it is still possible to establish intraosseous access. Performing several procedures in protective clothing is technically difficult and exhausting, which is especially true for CPR. Certain intra-hospital procedures must be modified, for example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a patient with ARDS in a prone position and electrical defibrillation.",
