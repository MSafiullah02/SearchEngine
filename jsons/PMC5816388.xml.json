Rhabdoviruses have a wide geographic distribution and can infect a wide range of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Furthermore, it can infect arthropods, which may act as vectors for the viral transmission [1, 2]. The non-segmented single stranded RNA genome of 11\u201316 Kb is packaged within the distinct bullet-shaped viral particles (with envelope). This genome comprises the genes encoding for five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the large protein (L, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), which is the most highly conserved protein. The genome of rhabdoviruses may also contain additional ORFs encoding putative proteins, which have mostly unknown functions [1, 2].",

Other than lyssaviruses, this strain represents the only bat-borne rhabdovirus fully sequenced and isolated in cell cultures in Europe. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus of Ledantevirus. In addition, a VAPV specific RT-PCR has been developed, which is available for further diagnostic and epidemiological investigations.",
