As of March 13th, 2020, a total of 81003 cases have been confirmed in China. CoVs are common pathogens with highly infectious for humans and vertebrates. They can infect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous system of human, mouse, bat, avian, livestock and many other wild animals.1, 2, 3 Since the outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the possibility of CoVs transmission from animal to human has been proved.4\n,\n5 Notably, via deep sequencing and etiological investigations, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a novel coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV.",

The genome of CoVs is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~30 kb) with 5\u2032-cap structure and 3\u2032-poly-A tail.6 The genomic RNA is used as a template to directly translate polyprotein (pp) 1a/1 ab, the non-structural proteins (nsps) to form a replication-transcription complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs).7 Subsequently, a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are synthesized by RTC in a discontinuous transcription manner.8 Genomes and subgenomes of CoVs contain at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF1a/b), about 2/3 of genome length, encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16). These polypeptides will be processed into 16 nsps by virally encoded protease.9\n,\n10 Hydrophobic transmembrane domains are present in nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 in order to anchor the nascent pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins to membranes once RTC formation. Other ORFs on the 1/3 genome near 3\u2032 terminus encodes at least 4 main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these 4 main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as 3a/b protein. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs RNAs of CoVs.8 In addition, a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and 3\u2032-UTR were also identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Thus, studies about microRNA might be necessary and significant. Furthermore, a number of cellular proteins have been shown to interact with CoVs RNA. These include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, poly (A)-binding protein, and mitochondrial aconitase.11 Understanding of the genome-structure-function correlation in SARS-CoV-2 is important for the identification of potential anti-viral inhibitors and vaccine targets.",

Thus, if there some existing drugs could be authenticated therapeutic, it will greatly improve the prognosis of patients. A total of 7 drugs were predicted to bind with 1# polypeptide. Notably, the 1# polypeptide could form the replicase polyprotein 1a (ORF1a).38 Normally, ORF1a and ORF1b (transcriptase) often form a heterodimer (ORF1ab) which may serve specific roles in virulence, virus-cell interactions and alterations of defense response. In ORF1a, the detailed analysis revealed evidence of adaptive mutations exceeded structural proteins.39 For example, the ORF1a polyprotein showed a rate of nonsynonymous substitutions similar to that in the S gene. Among the screened drugs, the 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid has the best binding efficiency with ORF1a through the 3D structural fitting. Unfortunately, this hypothesis lacks enough evidence. Furthermore, 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid is known as a component of crystallization buffer. Such buffer molecules including Tris, Hepas, glycerinum, DMSO and water usually appear in crystal structures but make no sense for drug discovery of virus. Thus, though the predicted results of 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid were ideal, it dose not mean 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid own effective virus suppression. In contrast, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively.40\n,\n41 Strangely, the 2-[(2,4-dichloro-5-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1,3-dinitro-5-(trifluoromrthyl)benzene could not bind with any region in 1# polypeptide which may be caused by 2 reasons: 1, It has bigger molecular weight and a more complicated structure, results in a lower affinity with the polypeptide. 2, there are 2 chlorine atoms in this drug which might lead to a weakened recognized ability between drug and peptide chain.",
