            "text": "Sickle cell anaemia is a hereditary disorder of haemoglobin (Hb) where the sickle gene is inherited, homozygously, from both parents. The sickle mutation is the result of a single base change (GAT \u2192 GTT) in the sixth codon of exon 1 of the \u03b2-globin gene responsible for the synthesis of the \u03b2-globin polypeptide of the Hb molecule (\u03b12\u03b22). This change, in turn, results in replacement of the normal glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the \u03b2-globin chain and the formation of sickle Hb.[6,7] In a sense, the mutation is akin to a typographical error where a change of one letter of a keyword of a manuscript (\u2018punctuation mutation\u2019) corrupts the meaning of the intended message. Typographical errors in articles, however, are episodic and have a transient effect that is effaced with time. The sickle mutation, on the hand, is permanent and often afflicts a life with pain, disability and morbid existence.",

Progress in the pathogenesis of vascular occlusion pertains to cellular dehydration and adhesion to endothelial cells described in sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, respectively.\n\n",

Previous studies (vide infra) showed that activated P-selectin triggers clotting in platelets and helps leucocytes to adhere to endothelial cells, and they assumed that RBC did not bind directly to P-selectin. Matsui et al.[41] presented the first evidence that P-selectin binds to normal RBC and, to a greater extent, to sickle RBC.

LM-609, on the other hand, selectively inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23. Infusion of washed sickle cell anaemia RBC in the ex vivo mesocecum of the rat, pretreated with PAF, with or without a control antibody resulted in extensive adhesion of sickle RBC in venules associated with post-capillary blockage. Pre-treatment of the vasculature with either 73E or LM-609, but not with control antibody, inhibited the adhesion of sickle RBC in postcapillary venules.

Generally speaking, \u03b1 gene deletion is associated with milder anaemia,[52] and hence fewer complications associated with severe anaemia and less blood transfusion. The increased haemoglobin level associated with \u03b1 gene deletion, however, increases the blood viscosity, which is often accompanied by increased frequency of painful crises[53,54] and vaso-occlusive episodes such as avascular necrosis.[55,56] The effect of \u03b1 gene deletion on the clinical picture is best illustrated in patients with sickle cell anaemia with two \u03b1 gene deletions (\u03b2s/\u03b2s, -\u03b1/-\u03b1). Table III lists the unique features of this type of sickle cell anaemia.[57\u201360] Noteworthy is that hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2) is elevated in sickle cell anaemia with two \u03b1 gene deletions, a finding that confuses this diagnosis with S-\u03b2-thalassemia that is typically also associated with elevated Hb A2 levels. This clinical picture, family history, haematological data and molecular diagnostics can differentiate the two diagnoses.[59]\n\n",

Moreover, Hb F seems to affect the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of RBC and coagulation activation. In vivo cycles of sickling/ unsickling with resulting membrane changes and microvesicle formation are one factor responsible for phosphatidylserine exposure.[64] Phosphatidylserine-exposing RBC in the transgenic sickle mouse[65] were found to have shortened red cell survival.

The role of epistatic genes in modifying the phenotypic expression is currently an active area of research. Future research findings may enable us to decipher the intricate pathophysiology of sickle cell anaemia and its complications, and usher in newer therapeutic venues.",

Tissue damage, in turn, releases several mediators of inflammation that initiate a painful stimulus that is transmitted along A-\u03b4 and C peripheral nerve fibres to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. From there the stimulus crosses to the contralateral side and ascends along the spinothalamic tracts to the thalamus, which in turn, sends the message to the brain where the stimulus is perceived as pain.",

Currently, tramadol is not a scheduled drug and it seems to be as effective as paracetamol with 30mg codeine with the added advantage of a tricyclic antidepressant-like effect. Tramadol may be administered by the oral or parenteral route, and it is available in slow-release form. Only the oral form is approved for marketing in the US at the present.

Hospitalised patients receiving opioid analgesics on a regular basis should be monitored for their respiratory rate and sedation level. A respiratory rate less than 10 per min and/or severe sedation justifies missing, decreasing or delaying the dose, or discontinuing the opioid in question until the depressive effects disappear. Opioid analgesics should be used carefully in patients with impaired ventilation, asthma, increased intracranial pressure and liver failure. The dosage of pethidine and morphine should be adjusted in the presence of renal failure. They are also histaminergic and histamine release may trigger bronchospasm or initiate an allergic reaction. Morphine is the most histaminergic of all opioids.[88] The presence of paracetamol in combination with codeine or oxycodone limits the daily dose that can be safely used so that the maximum allowable dosage of paracetamol is not exceeded. The use of paracetamol in conjunction with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause a severe adverse reaction characterised by excitation, hyperpyrexia, convulsions and death.[89] The co-administration of antipsychotics with pethidine may cause neuromuscular disorders including akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[90]",

Thus, the use of phenotypically matched blood, at least for these antigens, is highly recommended.[100] Some blood banks implemented programs to increase communication between the African-American community and medical facilities to ensure the presence of a blood supply from African-American donors directed for patients with sickle cell anaemia in order to reduce the incidence of allo-immunisation to those antigens that are prevalent in African-Americans. However, there are no data to show the desirable outcome, if any, of this practice.

These patients should be followed-up regularly and the levels of hepatic enzymes monitored periodically. Increase in the enzyme level beyond what is expected in sickle cell disease is an indication for a liver biopsy. If the latter shows evidence of hepatitis, specific therapy with a combination of interferon and ribavirin[101] would be considered. Patients with sickle cell anaemia taking ribavirin should be monitored carefully because ribavirin may worsen their haemolytic anaemia.[102]\n\n",

Several acquired abnormalities render patients with sickle cell disease immunocompromised and hence susceptible to a number of infections that are a major cause of mortality and morbidity. These include immunomodulation secondary to blood transfusion and iron overload.[103] The increased susceptibility of patients to infection with polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae) is secondary to absence of splenic function. Cellular immunity may be compromised by transfusion-related iron overload and abnormalities in B cell immunity may explain antigen processing defects. Infections due to Escherichia coli are usually associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in adult patients. Patients with sickle cell anaemia are susceptible to osteomyelitis secondary to Salmonella typhimurium in addition to the usual causes of bacterial osteomyelitis such as Staphylococcus aureus.[71] The susceptibility to infection by salmonella may reflect the ability of this organism to flourish in partially necrotic bone.",

At the same time, serum levels of secretory phospholipase A2, (sPLA2), an inflammatory mediator, increase in patients with acute chest syndrome[128] and liberate free fatty acids from membrane phospholipids of damaged tissue that are believed to cause damage to pulmonary endothelium culminating in a leak syndrome which, if severe, may be similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Microscopic haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension and the nephrotic syndrome are markers of incipient end-stage renal failure. Proteinuria occurs in 25% of patients with sickle cell anaemia and elevated serum creatinine levels in approximately 7%. Proteinuria causes congestion of tubular endothelium as a result of tubular uptake of protein. Congestion induces growth factors which, in turn, lead to proliferation of fibroblasts that culminate in renal fibrosis and renal failure. The pathological lesion is usually glomerular enlargement and peripheral focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Treatment with enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) seems to reduce the degree of proteinuria in patients with sickle cell anaemia suggesting that capillary hypertension may be a pathogenic factor in sickle cell nephropathy. Once chronic renal failure sets in, patients require long-term haemodialysis and are candidates for kidney transplantation.[9,10,71]",

It can result from tricorporal involvement (both of the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum) or bicorporal involvement (both corpora cavernosa). The latter is more common, especially in children, and is not regularly associated with impotence. There are two major clinical presentations of priapism: acute and chronic.[141] The acute presentation is characterised by a prolonged painful erection that persists beyond several hours, responds poorly to exchange transfusion and frequently requires surgical intervention. Acute priapism may be followed by complete or partial impotence. The chronic form of priapism is characterised by repetitive, reversible, painful erections called \u2018stuttering\u2019 priapism. It usually occurs after intercourse or it may awaken patients early in the morning. Stuttering priapism responds well to diazepam or pseudoephedrine. Patients who become impotent may benefit from psychological counselling and the insertion of penile implants. A practical and relatively simple approach to manage outpatients with priapism has been recently reported.[127] Specifically, aspiration of the corpora cavernosa followed by irrigation with a dilute epinephrine solution was effective in producing detumescence in most patients. Patients who do not respond to this approach are potential candidates for exchange transfusion and/or surgery.[142]",

Major mechanisms by which water is lost from sickle cells include the Ca2+-activated potassium channel (Gardos channel) and the KCl co-transport channel. Activation of these channels results in K+ and water loss from sickle erythrocytes with consequent dehydration. A decrease in the intracellular concentration of sickle Hb, even small decreases, can slow the polymerisation of sickle Hb to a point where RBCs can exit from the capillaries (decreased transit time) before the sickle Hb polymerises (increased delay time for polymerisation). Hydroxyurea achieves this goal by decreasing the effective concentration of sickle Hb and diluting it with Hb F, which does not participate in polymerisation. Another approach to inhibit polymerisation is to rehydrate sickle RBCs and restore their normal water content.[178,179]",

The effects of clotrimazole on cellular rehydration, however, were very modest compared with those seen in hydroxyurea. Nevertheless, the advent of clotrimazole offers a novel and different therapeutic approach for the treatment of sickle cell disease. It warrants a larger long-term clinical trial to determine its efficacy in the primary treatment of sickle cell disease. Furthermore, a combination of hydroxyurea and clotrimazole may ensue in an additive beneficial effect in ameliorating the clinical picture of sickle cell disease. Similar results were found by the use of oral magnesium,[179] which inhibits the KCl co-transport channel.",

Although management of sickle cell anaemia continues to be primarily palliative in nature, there have been promising preventative and curative approaches to therapy. Pain management should be individualised and coupled with the proper utilisation of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in order to acheive adequate pain relief. Early recognition and treatment of organ failure minimises morbidity and improves outcome. The use of hydroxyurea decreases the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease. Cure is possible in selected children with bone marrow or cord blood transplantation. Future research seems to focus on refining the molecular and cellular approaches to therapy including gene therapy, and mechanisms that rehydrate sickle RBC and/or prevent their adhesion to vascular endothelium.",
