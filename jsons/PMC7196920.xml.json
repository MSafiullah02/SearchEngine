Previous studies reported non-survivors present a higher proportion of various co-existing chronic illnesses in univariate analysis [4,10\u201312]. Consistent with previous reports [10,13,14], our study indicated that COVID-19 patients with heart, liver, and kidney comorbidities had a higher risk of related organ injuries and death, compared with those without comorbidities. The cardiac, liver, and kidney complications can occur precipitously at any point during hospitalization and are increasingly being described as late complications that can occur after improvements in a patient\u2019s respiratory status. Although it is impossible to distinguish whether heart, liver, and kidney injury were caused by viral infection, or drug-related side effects during treatment, or by existing comorbidities, we observed a higher mortality in COVID-19 patients with more severe grade of existing comorbidities. The result suggested that existing comorbidities were at least one of the factors contributing to COVID-19-related deaths. During the treatment of COVID-19 patients, except for focusing on respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection, a series of organ-injuries and deaths related to heart, liver, and kidney comorbidities were also worthy of close monitoring.",
