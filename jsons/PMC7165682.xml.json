However, they can also harbour viruses that have zoonotic potential (Moratelli & Calisher, 2015; Vasconcelos & Calisher, 2016; Wynne & Wang, 2013). Due to the possible impact on human health, there is increasing interest in determining which viruses infect bats and clarifying the role that these mammals play in the ecology of zoonotic viruses.",

            "text": "Of particular interest for the Caribbean region is the role bats may play in the ecology of mosquito\u2010borne zoonotic arboviruses, as several of these viruses are either endemic or have been recently introduced (Gibson, Fitzpatrick, Stone, Noel, & Macpherson, 2016). It is unknown whether or not bats can play a role in inter\u2010epidemic viral maintenance in sylvatic cycles. A first step in investigating whether bats may be important in the ecology of any of these viruses is to determine whether exposure occurs under natural conditions. Several studies have documented bat exposure to mosquito\u2010transmitted zoonotic alphaviruses and flaviviruses in various parts of the world. For example, a recent study in Trinidad identified bats that were positive for antibodies to Venezuelan encephalitis virus (VEEV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) by epitope\u2010blocking enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to an undetermined flavivirus by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) (Thompson et al., 2015). A study of insectivorous bats in New Jersey and New York detected antibodies that neutralized West Nile virus (WNV) and SLEV (Pilipski, Pilipskl, & Risley, 2004). Bats with neutralizing antibodies to VEEV, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and SLEV have also been reported in Guatemala (Ubico & McLean, 1995), and bats with neutralizing antibodies to SLEV have been found in Ohio (Herbold, Heuschele, Berry, & Parsons, 1983). A study on bats in Indonesia detected HIA antibodies against both flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus [ZIKV]) and alphaviruses (Ross River virus and chikungunya virus [CHIKV]), but failed to detect any neutralizing antibodies to these viruses (Olson et al., 1983).",

            "text": "Currently, the mosquito\u2010borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses with highest public health significance in the Caribbean are dengue virus (DENV), CHIKV and ZIKV (Gibson et al., 2016). Several studies have found evidence of bat exposure to, or infection with DENV under natural conditions, across a wide range of endemic areas and utilizing various detection methods. Dengue virus has been detected in bats in the Gulf and Pacific coasts of Mexico by RT\u2010PCR and by DENV NS1 protein detection (Aguilar\u2010Setien et al., 2008), and in south\u2010eastern Mexico by RT\u2010PCR (Sotomayor\u2010Bonilla et al., 2014). Antibodies that neutralized DENV were detected in bats in Mexico (Machain\u2010Williams et al., 2013), Costa Rica and Ecuador (Platt et al., 2000). However, all titres in these bats were low, indicating that they could have been infected with a DENV\u2010like virus not included in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) analysis. Furthermore, experimental infection of the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) with DENV serotypes 1 and 4 did not demonstrate viremia or seroconversion (Cabrera\u2010Romo et al., 2014), and some studies failed to detect seropositive bats in areas where DENV is known to circulate (Cabrera\u2010Romo et al., 2016; Maguire, Macnamara, Miles, Spears, & Mataika, 1971). These contrasting results may be the product of confounding factors such as bat species, DENV serotype, geographic region and the type of antibody assay used. Antibodies to CHIKV have been detected in wild rodents (Darwish, Hoogstraal, Roberts, Ahmed, & Omar, 1983; Vourc'h et al., 2014) and non\u2010human primates (Vourc'h et al., 2014) exposed under natural conditions. Experimental infection of bats with CHIKV has been performed with no apparent clinical signs (Bedekar & Pavri, 1969; Bosco\u2010Lauth, Nemeth, Kohler, & Bowen, 2016), but one of these studies demonstrated that bats can generate neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV (Bosco\u2010Lauth et al., 2016). With the exception of one report describing the isolate of CHIKV from the fruit bat Rousettus leschenaultia in China (Chen & Tao, 1996) and phylogenetic evidence indicating the involvement of bats in the zoonotic potential of alphaviruses (Olival et al., 2017), there have been no published reports that confirm exposure of bats to CHIKV under natural conditions. Of note is that ZIKV was introduced into the Caribbean after samples for this study were collected, and thus, exposure to this virus was not examined.",

As is common in the Caribbean, humans in Grenada live in close proximity to bats, and both bats and mosquitos are abundant and active year around. Grenada reflects much of the rest of the Caribbean in that DENV has been endemic for decades and by experiencing the introduction and epidemic of CHIKV in 2014. Thus, Grenada provides an ideal setting within which to determine whether bats are exposed to these, and possibly other, zoonotic mosquito\u2010transmitted alphaviruses and flaviviruses under natural conditions. Importantly, the study reported here reflects data on bats sampled in the fall of 2015, a year after the peak chikungunya epidemic in Grenada (PAHO, [Link]) and before ZIKV was detected on this island (PAHO, [Link]).",

Digital images were collected, and a written report was generated on each bat to document location of capture, species, sex, age (juvenile, subadult or adult) and gross findings. Cardiac blood collection was performed immediately after isoflurane overdose to obtain serum samples. Serum volume varied depending on the bat's size, from 0.1 ml in the smaller insectivorous bats (weight 10\u201312 g) to 1 ml in the larger fruit bats (weight 40\u201360 g).",

For TS, CS and B, the mean optical densities from duplicate tests were used. An inhibition value of 30% or greater was considered to indicate the presence of viral antibodies (Blitvich et al., 2003).

            "text": "Chikungunya virus was introduced into Grenada in 2014, and the first documented human case was in May 2014 (PAHO, [Link]). Serologic evidence of bat exposure to CHIKV needs to be interpreted with caution because of the possible cross\u2010reactivity with Mayaro virus (MAYV), a related alphavirus endemic to Latin America (Garcia de Figueiredo & Figueiredo, 2014). Although serological cross\u2010reactivity has been observed in human humoral immune responses, it remains unclear if a similar cross\u2010reactivity occurs in bats (Fox et al., 2015). Mayaro virus is mostly confined to forest ecosystems (Vasconcelos & Calisher, 2016), but urban human cases have been reported, most recently from the Caribbean island of Haiti (Lednicky et al., 2016). The presence of MAYV in Grenada is unknown. In support of our positive CHIKV serologic results, a concurrent study on the molecular detection of alphaviruses in a larger bat sample confirmed the presence of CHIKV in one of the 15 CHIKV\u2010seropositive bats included in this study, and in seven of 73 bats (9.6%) not serologically tested (Cheetham, manuscript in preparation). It is possible that a subset of the CHIKV\u2010seropositive bats in this study, particularly those with low PRNT50 titres, could have been exposed to a CHIKV\u2010like virus not included in the PRNT analysis. This is unlikely because the only alphavirus identified by RT\u2010PCR and Sanger sequencing was CHIKV. Importantly, bats for this study were trapped a year after the peak of the human CHIKV epidemic on the island (PAHO, [Link]), and seropositive bats were identified from five of the six parishes of the island of Grenada. Thus, our results indicate that bats living close to and within human settlements were exposed to CHIKV in multiple locations and may have been exposed during a time of marked decline in human cases (PAHO fall 2014 and 2015 data). Future studies will determine if bats continue to be infected with CHIKV even in the absence of human infections.",

Of interest is that the per cent positive for VEEV antibodies due to this one bat (one bat = 2.6% of those tested) is in close agreement with results (2.9%) from a larger number of tested bats in Trinidad (Thompson et al., 2015), a much larger island located 103 miles from Grenada, and a region where VEEV is known to circulate (Jonkers, Aitken, Spence, & Worth, 1966). The same epitope\u2010blocking ELISA was used in both studies. The detection of one seropositive bat constitutes the first report of antibodies to VEEV in any animal in Grenada. Additional testing will be required to confirm this observation and determine whether VEEV is actively circulating in Grenada.",

            "text": "Bussuquara virus was the only flavivirus that neutralized bat serum. The BSQV neutralizing antibodies were detected in a single bat, and it had a low PRNT80 titre (20) indicating it may have been exposed to another, perhaps unrecognized, flavivirus not included in the PRNT analysis. The only flavivirus known to be circulation in Grenada at the time of this study is DENV. Historically, DENV has been endemic in Grenada for decades and all four serotypes have been documented on the island at various times between 2000 and 2013 (Schioler & Macpherson, 2009). Thus, the lack of detection of antibodies that neutralized DENV in the 50 bats tested in this study was an unexpected result. In an endemic area of Mexico, antibodies that neutralized DENV were detected in the two species of fruit bat that were also evaluated in this study, A. jamaicensis and A. lituratus (Machain\u2010Williams et al., 2013). In endemic areas of Costa Rica and Ecuador, DENV serotype 2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in an unspecified Artibeus species (Platt et al., 2000). Importantly, the concurrent molecular study (Cheetham, manuscript in preparation) confirmed the presence of DENV RNA in six of the 50 DENV\u2010seronegative bats in this study and in 35 bats not serologically tested. Two of the sequenced bands confirmed DENV\u20103. Our negative DENV serology results may reflect lack of, or undetectable levels of, neutralizing antibody responses developed against the DENV serotype circulating in Grenada at the time the bats sampled in this study became infected. It will be important to determine the type of immune responses to DENV in naturally exposed Grenada bats, including whether there is a consistent lack of neutralizing antibodies to some serotypes in some bat species, and whether or not bats generate non\u2010neutralizing antibodies. Answering these questions will shed light on the potential that bats have to establish persistent infections and high\u2010titre viraemias, with implications for the role of bats in the ecology of specific DENV serotypes.",

However, out of the 308 bats tested in Trinidad, a few were found positive for RBV (1.0%) and SLEV (or a closely related virus: 1.8%) by HIA and blocking ELISA, respectively (Thompson et al., 2015). It is possible that RBV and SLEV are either not circulating in Grenada or are present at very low levels and that the smaller sample size in this study did not allow for detection. It is also possible that bats do not make neutralizing antibodies in response to infection with these viruses and thus were missed by the PRNT used in this study.",

Future studies will determine whether bats continue to be exposed to CHIKV in Grenada in the absence of human infections, the types and duration of antibody responses to CHIKV and whether bats under natural conditions can develop high\u2010level viraemias sufficient to infect the primary vector in Grenada, Aedes aegypti.",
