Due to successful immunization programs we rarely hear about some of the common diseases of the early twentieth century including small pox and polio. Vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry, cattle, and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals. Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria. Abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains; hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Changes in climate is another concern for vaccinologists. Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines. Use of conventional vaccination strategies to develop vaccines has severe limitations; hence innovative strategies are essential in the development of novel and effective vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of medicine providing protection against debilitating diseases and have spared millions of lives. Smallpox, polio, measles , diphtheria, pertussis , rubella , mumps , and tetanus were once common diseases of man that killed millions of people (until the fi rst half of the twentieth century) before the advent of vaccines. Fortunately, we rarely hear about these diseases today due to the widespread introduction of immunization programs. The introduction of safe, affordable, and effective vaccines has dramatically improved public health , prevented countless hospitalizations, and substantially increased industrial output [ 1 ] . Though in the short term vaccines prevent diseases, in the long term mass vaccinations are successful in eradicating infectious diseases. Vaccinations have helped in eradicating several diseases in developed countries; however, there are only two diseases that have been eradicated globally. Mass awareness programs and aggressive vaccination strategies in the twentieth century were able to control smallpox and in a landmark event the disease was offi cially declared eradicated in 1980. Rinderpest, a serious disease of cattle, was offi cially eradicated in 2011, thereby becoming only the second disease to be completely eradicated [ 1 ] . Recently the Americas (North and South America) have become the fi rst in the world to be declared free of endemic transmission of rubella, a contagious viral disease that can cause multiple birth defects as well as fetal death when contracted by women during pregnancy. The achievement was due to a 15-year effort that involved widespread administration of the vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) throughout the Western Hemisphere. The declaration of elimination by Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) makes rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) the third and fourth vaccine-preventable diseases to be eliminated from the Americas, following the regional eradication of smallpox in 1971 and the elimination of polio in 1994 (source: World Health Organization). This chapter reviews the future challenges of vaccinologists.",

Abuse of antibiotics is not restricted to patients alone, but also occurs in the food supply chain. In veterinary medicine antibiotics are used not only in the treatment and prevention of disease but also for growth promotion in food animals [ 4 ] ; though many countries have banned use of antibiotics for growth promotion there are places where banning is not enforced vigorously. One of the reasons for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is due to the uncontrolled use of antibiotics in the food supply chain. Hence there is a need to develop new and improved vaccines for animals so that they are protected during their life-span from different pathogens. Reduced use of antibiotics for the control of diseases in animals will lead to low levels of antibiotics in the food supply chain which could lead to lowering of the incidence of antibiotic resistance .",

The importance of VRE is that it is capable of genetically transferring its resistance genes to such organisms as MRSA. Vancomycinresistant MRSA (VR-MRSA) is a major threat, because it is expected to be highly communicable and diffi cult to treat because of limited antibiotic therapy [ 5 ] .

Rabies is due to viral infection typically transmitted to people via bites from infected animals, especially bats, carnivores, or domestic mammals. The disease has no cure other than vaccination. Because of aggressive vaccination programs for pets, most rabies cases in developed countries are transmitted from wildlife species. However, most rabies in developing countries is canine related, notably stray dogs. The difference between a developed nation and developing nation is how the resources (however small) are managed. Some of the offi ces in developing countries are occupied by people with no interest in caring the public. The characteristic feature of cities in developing nations is poor urban management. One could observe poor waste management practices-with unmoved garbage at every intersection, stray dogs and cattle sharing the road, open and overfl owing drains and sewage, and stagnant water bodies which provide breeding grounds for insects. These unhygienic conditions in cities are favorable grounds for a plethora of infectious diseases. The fi rst line of defense against rabies is controlling the stray dog population.

Despite intensive research since the 1980s there are no vaccines or drugs that can successfully prevent or eradicate the disease. The major barriers to HIV vaccine development include the variability of HIV, lack of a suitable animal model , lack of correlates of protective immunity , lack of natural protective immune response s against HIV, and the reservoir of infected cells conferred by integration of HIV's genome into the host [ 1 ] . Within the main HIV-1 subgroup, Group M, there are nine clades as well as dozens of recombinant forms, and clades can vary up to 42 % at the amino acid level [ 15 ] . A vaccine immunogen derived from a particular clade may therefore be ineffective against other clades, posing a signifi cant obstacle to the creation of a global HIV vaccine. Importantly, one of the principal barriers limiting discovery of an HIV vaccine has been that protective immune response s tend to be polyclonal and involve antibodies directed to several different epitopes; thus, antigenic variation among the different HIV-1 isolates has been the major problem in the development of an effective vaccine against AIDS [ 1 ] . Although several 3D structures of HIV-1 envelope protein fragments have been determined, this knowledge has not yet led to the design of an HIV-1 vaccine. The mechanism by which an HIV vaccine might confer protection therefore remains uncertain, and an effective vaccine may require induction of an immune response that is signifi cantly different from that seen during natural infection [ 16 ] . Overall, current vaccination strategies have not helped in developing a vaccine for HIV; hence novel \"out-of-the-box\" strategies are essential in developing an HIV vaccine [ 17 ] .",

The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes an acute viral syndrome that presents with fever and an ensuing bleeding diathesis that is marked by high mortality in human and nonhuman primate s. Fatality rates are higher than other viral diseases with rates of up to 90 % [ 18 ] . Ebola viral disease (EVD) affects the poorest people in the African continent. Due to movement of people across borders the disease could rapidly spread and infect any people globally. EBOV spreads through human-tohuman transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fl uids of infected people and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fl uids. EBOV glycoprotein (GP1,2) and matrix protein (VP40) are both major components of EBOV. The hemorrhagic disease caused by EBOV is characterized by generalized fl uid distribution problems, hypotension, coagulation disorders, and a tendency to bleed, fi nally resulting in fulminant shock. Vascular instability and dysregulation are hallmarks of the pathogenesis in EBOV hemorrhagic fever (HF). Endothelial disturbances can be caused indirectly, by proinfl ammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 released from EBOV-infected monocytes/macrophages, and directly, following virus infection of endothelial cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that EBOV viral proteins could activate endothelial cells and induce a decrease in blood vessel barrier function [ 19 ] . The worldwide challenge posed by the 2014 outbreak of EBOV [ 20 ] has underscored the need for effective prevention and treatment options, especially for front-line health care and emergency response workers in the fi eld, and at hospitals and other care facilities. As yet there are no vaccines or therapeutics commercially available to protect against EVD. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a powerful vaccine which could provide robust protection against the viral pathogen . The EBOV and its high fatality are known since the 1970s. The disease only affects a small percentage of people annually in Africa; hence government agencies as well as International Organizations were not keen to invest in vaccines. If there were vaccines available against EBOV infection, thousands of lives could have been saved in 2014.",

New infl uenza virus pandemics in the twenty-fi rst century are a certainty. It has been reported that H5N1 viruses are taking a huge toll on the poultry industry in many developing countries, and this directly or indirectly impacts both economic and social well-being. While the H5N1 virus transmits zoonotically from infected poultry to humans, often with fatal consequences, such transmission remains ineffi cient [ 35 ] .

Heartwater, a rickettsial disease of ruminants, caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium is one of the most important diseases of livestock in Africa. This tick-borne illness can significantly decrease productivity in regions where it is endemic. As yet there are no vaccines for this disease. Similarly, Johne's disease (JD) is a chronic disease affecting ruminants and other species caused by the pathogenic Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). This fastidious bacterium infects and survives in the intestines; MAP-infected cattle can remain asymptomatic for years while transmitting the pathogen via fecal contamination and milk. MAP is able to survive the process of pasteurization as well as chemical processes seen in irrigation purifi cation systems. Subsequently meat, dairy products, and water serve as key vehicles in the transmission of MAP infection to humans. Recent studies demonstrate that MAP is associated with Crohn's disease (CD) in humans [ 36 ] . A novel vaccine against MAP could decrease the incidence of MAP in cows and cattle, thereby preventing its occurrence in the food supply chain.",

The vaccines developed by these technologies saved millions of people and many of those vaccines are still in use today. Infl uenza, oral and inactivated polio, measles , mumps , and rubella are good examples of the vaccines that we still use and were developed with this empirical approach. Since the 1980s new technologies started to emerge that made possible vaccines that were impossible with the empirical approach. The fi rst technology was recombinant DNA that made vaccinologists possible to express the hepatitis B virus-like particle (VLP) in yeast and produce large amounts of vaccines. More recently recombinant DNA technologies were used to generate yeast or baculovirus strains expressing VLPs containing the L1 protein of papillomavirus. The next technology that changed the vaccine landscape was the conjugation technology. In this technology, capsular polysaccharides purifi ed from Haemophilus infl uenzae, 13 serogroups of pneumococcus or meningococcus A, C, Y, and W, covalently linked to carrier proteins have been licensed during the last 25 years and have completely eliminated the diseases caused by these bacteria. Finally, the advent of genomics allowed the use of the entire genome of pathogens and to search for protective antigens that were diffi cult or impossible to identify with conventional technologies. The prototype vaccine developed by genome-based approach, also known as reverse vaccinology , is the vaccine against Meningococcus B that was licensed in Europe in 2013 and the USA in January 2015 [ 40 ] .",
