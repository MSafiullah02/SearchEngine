No researcher could be absolutely sure that all transmissions within an individual \u201csuperspreading\u201d event were nosocomial and were related to the putative index case, unless fingerprinting of the virus for all cases was done. This also applies to \u201ctransmission chains,\u201d which are frequently adopted to describe infectious disease transmissions inside hospitals by infection control units. We actually included all nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) documented by the infection control units, and thus, we identified index patients in some wards. For the analysis of host factors, as well as the combined analysis of environmental and administrative factors and host factors, only case wards with documented nosocomial outbreaks of SARS (with identified index patients) were used [2].",

We made every effort to minimize the possible biases and discussed the details in our article [2].

For environmental and administrative factors, the reported information during the 10-day study period referred to the average (usual) situation. Unless drastic changes were introduced (none documented in any ward) within these 10 days, the information collected should reflect the situation before the infection transmission events.",

We feel that a type of \u201ca priori bias\u201d has been happening among certain groups of the infection control community: any findings not in line with the a priori hypothesis or belief get rejected. It all reverts to the droplet and/or contact versus aerosol (airborne) spread debate. \u201cThe clinical implications of airborne transmission are particularly important for infection control in hospitals\u201d [4, p. 1711]. The deep-rooted biased view of how SARS and other similar respiratory infections could be transmitted could have resulted in the loss of golden opportunities for effective control of such outbreaks. Will the infection-control community learn the lesson?",
