            "text": "Sudden disease emergences, now often considered events, have been reported since antiquity. Perhaps one of the earliest reported was described by Thucydides, the Athenian, who in his History of the Peloponnesian War (411 BC) described an as-yet unidentified plague that weakened the population of Athens in 430 BC at a critical point during its siege by the armies of Sparta. The Roman Empire was repeatedly beset by plague epidemics during its long dominance over Europe, North Africa and the Near East. The numerous transfers of viruses from the Old to the New World following the rediscovery of the Americas by Columbus in 1492 caused devastation of the native populations, particularly through the introduction of smallpox, reducing them to less than 10 percent of preconquest levels. In the 17th century, Daniel Defoe described in detail the impact of the Black Death on London in 1665 in his fictional book A Journal of a Plague Year. In modern times we have had the devastating pandemics of influenza, cholera and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Each of these events provokes similar questions. Where did it come from? How did it get here and why? The processes that underlie these events continue to this day and are collectively termed emerging and re-emerging diseases (Morse, 1995). The definition of an emerging disease is one that has newly appeared in a population or that has been known for some time but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. A number of recurring features of emerging diseases have been noted. Most are zoonotic, thus can infect humans and other animals. Many are viruses, particularly those with RNA genomes (Taylor et al., 2001).",

Figure 1.1\nprovides a schematic of the interfaces between humans, animals and viruses. It is these interfaces that are critical in understanding how and potentially when new diseases will emerge. However, many factors influence the emergence of diseases from animals and these are considered in the following sections. When considering the factors that lead to the emergence of viral diseases it becomes very apparent that there is a high degree of interrelatedness. For example, human encroachment in a virgin ecosystem provides the opportunity for a previously unencountered virus to infect human beings or their domestic animals. Viral mutability could enable a virus to adapt to the new host. Subsequent trade and migration could allow spread of the new virus to susceptible individuals and the large populations found in urban centers could ensure that the virus is maintained. The interplay of all these factors provides a rational framework and explanation for virus emergence. However, to gain an appreciation of the components of this process it is necessary to focus on each in itself before linking them together.",

This act has caused two of the most important activities that challenge the world today and is a major factor driving disease emergence. The first is the relentless modification of the environment. This ranges from major destruction of the environment through activities such as mining and waste disposal to relatively minor modifications such as provision of access for tourism. However, the most common modification usually begins with the clearance of vegetation for livestock pasture and crop cultivation. This may involve deforestation resulting in the catastrophic disruption of the existing ecosystem, displacing or destroying many species within it.",

The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is considered the progenitor of the domestic dog, which is now classified as a separate subspecies (Canis lupus familiaris) (Mech and Boitani, 2006). Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA derived from 654 domestic dogs from around the world suggests that there were relatively few domestication events, all taking place in southeast Asia (Savoilainen et al., 2002). This then led to the spread of dogs throughout the Old and New Worlds (Leonard et al., 2002). Documented remains of domestic dogs date back to 12,000 years ago in the Middle East (Davis and Valla, 1978) and this, together with molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial DNA, suggests a likely date of domestication around 15,000 years ago (Table 1.1\n). Subsequent selective breeding has led to the plethora of varieties that are now apparent today but all are derived from the wolf. Domestic dogs now provide a variety of functions that support human lives but have also brought their pathogens into close proximity to humans and their dwellings. The act of domesticating animals has been considered one of the major drivers in the emergence of human infectious diseases (Wolfe et al., 2007).",

Data collected by the United Nations suggested that the human population was estimated to be just short of seven billion in 2010 (anon, 2010) and continues to grow exponentially. Two countries, China and India, have populations of over one billion. This in turn drives all other human activities that might influence disease emergence. It increases the demand for food, which in turn increases the area needed for arable farming and the number of livestock to meet this demand. It has also changed the way in which livestock is reared, leading to increased intensive farming practices. More land is needed to accommodate agricultural production, which leads to further environmental encroachment that leads to displaced or altered behaviors in wildlife species.",

A prominent feature of migration over recent centuries has been the movement of populations from rural to urban centers, to a point where the majority of humans now reside in cities. This process has been driven by increases in the human population, developments in the intensification of agriculture reducing the need for human labor, and industrialization of societies that create more jobs in urban areas.

            "text": "Commerce and travel go hand in hand and have also played a part in the movement of disease. Yellow fever was introduced into the Americas, along with its vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, by the mass movement of slaves from Africa (Bryant et al., 2007). The subsequent trading network between Africa, the Americas and Europe led to sudden outbreaks of the disease in European ports during the 19th century. One of the best documented disease outbreaks occurred in 1865 in Swansea, a port city in southern Wales, following the embarkation of a ship from Cuba delivering copper ore (Meers, 1986). A combination of the introduction of infected mosquitoes from the ship and a particularly warm period in October led to a local outbreak at this unusually high latitude. This highlights the role of invasive species. Fortunately for South Wales, its climate is too cold in winter, although it certainly receives enough precipitation, to support over-wintering Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and it is assumed that the imported mosquitoes died out, causing a cessation in cases of yellow fever. However, many mosquito species have proven more robust and with a little human help have managed to move between continents. The trade in used tires by container ships has been instrumental in dispersing the aggressive biting mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Originally from Asia, it has spread to the Americas and then Europe (Benedict et al., 2007). The presence of this species in Italy contributed to an outbreak of Chikungunya fever following the return of viremic individuals returning to the country having visited islands in the Indian Ocean that were experiencing outbreaks of the disease. Other species such as Aedes japonicus have also emerged in Central Europe (Schaffner et al., 2009).",

The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 was triggered by the transfer of virus from roosting fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, to intensively farmed pigs (Eaton et al., 2006). This led to a rapid amplification of virus within the pig farm and provided the opportunity for infection of farm workers (Mohd Nor et al., 2000). This case is remarkable in that it resulted from the rapid jump of a virus across two species barriers within a short period of time (see Chapter 11).\n",

Table 1.2\nprovides details of a number of viruses that cause severe disease in livestock to illustrate this variety.",

The primary function of this protein or proteins is to engage with a host receptor and initiate entry of a virus into the target cell. It is assumed that for most viruses evolutionary pressure has led to a degree of specificity of this interaction at the level of host and even the cell type that the virus infects. This in turn will influence the mode of transmission of the virus and restrict its target cell range, its cellular tropism. This aspect of transmission forms the concept of the species barrier. However, other interactions between the virus and the host cell, such as the ability to subvert the innate immune response, utilization of cellular components and modification of cellular activities also provide barriers to virus replication. Simplistically, the species barrier restricts a particular virus to bind to a particular receptor, of a particular cell type of a particular host species. The ability to deviate away from this apparent host restriction forms the basis of cross-species transmission (CST) and is influenced by nonviral factors, such as the opportunity to be exposed to a new host, or by changes in the virus, as discussed below.",

Transmission of viruses forms a critical component of how viruses emerge and this may change as a disease epidemic evolves. HIV is an example of this. The initial events that caused HIV to jump from chimpanzees to humans cannot be known with any certainty although it may have occurred during butchery of bush meat, perhaps resulting from infection of an open wound, and is thus an example of mechanical transmission (see Chapter 9). However, there is no doubt that the resulting pandemic was spread primarily by sexual contact and to a lesser degree by contaminated needles and medical blood products. This example also returns to the role of human behavior in the rate of transmission. A combination of promiscuity and air travel promoted the rapid spread of a sexually transmitted disease.\n",

            "text": "Another human activity, congregating in large numbers, promotes transmission of airborne viruses. Activities such as attendance of schools, universities or sporting events are all high risk activities for contracting airborne diseases. This brings susceptible individuals into close contact with those that are infected. This has been the foundation for modeling of disease spread and persistence, as pioneered by Maurice Bartlett (Bartlett, 1957), who in the 1950s published a number of studies on the persistence of measles virus (Box 1.1\n). From these came the concept of Critical Community Size (CCS), the size a population needed to support persistence of a particular pathogen. For measles virus this was estimated to vary between 250,000 and 500,000 individuals. Below this, further transmission of virus would be reduced to a level that would cause the epidemic to fade out. Viral factors such as the persistence of the virus in the host, the duration of immunity to the virus and virus variation in response to host immunity will affect the CCS. A further factor that influences this is the birth rate of the host population (Conlan and Grenfell, 2007). Those populations with a higher birth rate will replenish the subpopulation of susceptible individuals and overall have a lower CCS, enhancing the ability of the infection to persist.Box 1.1Measles VirusThe VirusMeasles virus is a nonsegmented negative strand RNA virus classified within the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. Related viruses include canine distemper virus, rinderpest virus and peste de petit ruminant virus (Barrett, 1999).The DiseaseMeasles is transmitted by aerosols with infection initiating in the respiratory tract. The virus spreads to secondary lymphoid tissue followed by viremia 7 days following infection. This disseminates the virus to epithelial tissue in various organs and the skin (Griffin, 2010). The infected individual develops a range of symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic maculopapular rash. The virus is highly contagious but death is rare. In a small proportion of cases, virus persists in neurological tissue in a condition called subacute sclerosing pan encephalitis (SSPE), which can lead to destruction of the neurons and death.EradicationMeasles is one of the few pathogens that meet the criteria for disease eradication, the state where the agent of disease no longer exists in nature (Bremen et al., 2011). These are: 1) humans are the only reservoir for the pathogen, 2) diagnostic tests exist, and 3) an effective intervention, principally a vaccine, is available (Dowdle, 1999). Elimination, the interruption of transmission of a pathogen to a point where disease incidence becomes zero in a population within a defined geographical area, has been achieved for measles in the Americas (Moss and Strebel, 2011). The closely related rinderpest virus has recently been eradicated (Roeder, 2011).VaccineA live attenuated vaccine is available for measles that is given up to 18 months of age. It is safe and effective, providing life-long immunity. Vaccination programs aim to reach as many susceptible individuals as possible to reduce the ability of the virus to persist in the population. However, in recent years a decline in vaccine coverage has led to the re-emergence of measles virus in countries in which it had been virtually eliminated, such as the United Kingdom.Virus MutabilityReports suggest that measles virus mutates at comparable rates to other RNA viruses in the range of 10\u22124 to 10\u22123 mutations per nucleotide per year (Kuhne et al., 2006), but this does not appear to have reduced the protective immunity conferred by vaccination.",

An example of acute is the common cold, which results from rhinovirus infection, where the host sheds virus for a short period that can be as little as two days, but the infection resolves rapidly and the host is immune to further infections. In more extreme virus infections, disease does not resolve and the host dies. The converse of this is the development of a chronic infection where the host is capable of infecting susceptible individuals for a considerable period, often years. Viral infections such as hepatitis B virus and HIV are examples of this scenario. An intermediate condition exists where the host is chronically infected but sheds virus intermittently. A clear example of this is herpes simplex virus infections, where the virus remains dormant within infected dorsal root ganglia but emerges intermittently to cause a cold sore from which virus is shed. These are often triggered following periods of stress but resolve through immune control.",

This has enabled the calculation of the force of infection of a particular virus within a defined population. This approach has also been applied to transmission of vector-borne infections such as malaria and Dengue virus where the period of vector activity can be predicted. A similar approach has been used to estimate the force of infection of rabies virus transmitted by vampire bats based on the number of biting incidents per member of the population (Schneider et al., 1996). If force of infection can be estimated it could help in predicting the risk of host jumps by viruses and thus the likelihood of disease emergence.",

The high rate of mutation within RNA viruses has led to the development of quasispecies theory (Eigen, 1993). This theory attempts to explain some of the properties of RNA viruses through the existence of a highly variant virus population (see Box 1.2\n).Box 1.2Quasispecies TheoryQuasispecies theory has developed through the application of mathematics to explain the effects of higher mutation rates on RNA virus behavior. Some key definitions are (Domingo et al., 2005):QuasispeciesA weighted distribution of mutants centered around one master sequence.Mutation rateThe frequency of occurrence of a mutational event during genome replication.Mutant spectrumThe ensemble of mutant genomes that compose a quasispecies.FitnessA parameter that quantifies the adaptation of an organism or a virus to a given environment.Consensus sequenceThe sequence resulting from taking for each position the most frequent residue found at the corresponding position in the homologous set of aligned sequences.Sequence spaceA theoretical representation of all possible variants of a genomic sequence for a single-stranded RNA virus.The study of quasispecies has led to theories on virus fitness, persistence and mutation in the face of antivirus treatment (Lauring and Andino, 2010). It has also led to new concepts in treating RNA virus infections through increasing mutation rates that in turn increase deleterious mutations that cause virus population extinction (Ojosnegros et al., 2011). Some authors have argued against the existence of quasispecies (Holmes and Moya, 2002) and conceptually it is difficult to understand where quasispecies exist in time and space outside of an experimental setting.",

This is restricted to those viruses that have segmented genomes but has led to the emergence of viruses with clearly different properties such as increased virulence for humans. Bunyaviruses have a tripartite genome (see Chapters 8 and 10Chapter 8Chapter 10) and so are capable of reassortment. Although rare, a recent case of reassortment of an Orthobunyavirus isolated from a human with febrile illness has been reported (Aquilar et al., 2011). Orthomyxoviruses have eight genome segments and reassortment has led to antigenic shift of the virus surface proteins and emergence of influenza viruses to which there is no prior immunity. Finally Orbiviruses have 10 segments and reassortment is suspected to have led to the emergence of bluetongue virus variants in Europe (Batten et al., 2008).",

There is strong evidence that Western equine encephalitis virus emerged as a recombination between Eastern equine encephalitis virus and a Sindbis-like virus (Hahn et al., 1988). Further analysis has shown that many New World Alphaviruses have emerged following recombination events (Weaver et al., 1997). There is also growing evidence that sections of RNA virus genomes have been converted into double-stranded DNA and recombined within the genomes of certain host species. For example, sequences homologous to flavivirus RNA have been identified in the mosquito genome (Crochu et al., 2004) and ancestral fragments of Ebola virus have been identified in bat genomes (Taylor et al., 2011). It is not clear how this could have occurred with such viruses replicating exclusively in the cytoplasm of the cell.",

These are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which fall into three categories: the Toll-like receptors, the Rig-I receptors and the Nod-like receptors (Gerlier and Lyles, 2011). Activation of PPRs leads to transcriptional activation of type-1 interferon, principally interferon beta, which in turn activates further interferons and other proteins that actively inhibit viral replication and prevent further viral spread. Unsurprisingly, viruses have evolved many mechanisms to inhibit interferon activation by blocking signaling pathways that stimulate gene transcription (reviewed extensively by Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). The virus proteins from each of the viruses discussed in this book will be identified in the following chapters.\n",

Key examples of the spread of zoonotic viruses by migrating birds are the westward spread of H5N1 avian influenza from Asia to Europe and the movement of West Nile virus from Africa to Western Europe following well-traveled migration routes across the Mediterranean Sea (see Chapter 7). Migration therefore provides a direct vehicle for long-distance translocation of pathogens and thus the opportunity to emerge in new locations.",

The species has various adaptations to achieve this, including self-sharpening incisor teeth, anticoagulants in its saliva and grooves in its tongue to enhance blood lapping. As an unintended consequence of these adaptations, the vampire bat is a highly efficient transmission vector of rabies virus and is responsible for large numbers of livestock deaths (Belotto et al., 2005) and occasional transmission to humans in Latin America (Barbosa et al., 2008).
