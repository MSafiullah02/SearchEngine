Besides diseases because of traditional menaces such as cytomegalovirus and the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, we have seen other viruses such as human herpes virus 6 and human herpes virus 8 emerge as problems for some transplant recipients. We have also experienced the occurrence of West Nile virus infection in transplant recipients (1), an issue that will likely become more problematic in 2003 and beyond. While these infections are potentially devastating for transplant recipients, they share one important feature \u2013 namely transplant recipients do not represent a major vehicle by which infection is disseminated to others. Severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) infection represents a different threat \u2013 a threat that is characterized by grave consequences for the transplant recipient and the potential for transmission of infection to other patients, families and health care workers.",

The coronavirus phylogenetic tree prior to the advent of SARS\u2010CoV consisted of three groups of coronaviruses (4, 5). Coronaviruses from two of the three previously known groups of coronavirus are associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases of humans (5). While the genetic sequence of SARS\u2010CoV shares some features with group 1 coronaviruses, some genetic features suggest that it is distinct from the previously known groups of coronaviruses (5). Research continues to better define the place of the SARS\u2010CoV in the phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses.",

Children often present with milder disease than their adult counterparts (10), with no reliable way of differentiating the respiratory signs and symptoms from those caused by other respiratory infections. Consequently, the index of suspicion of cases of SARS is directly proportional to the strength of the epidemiologic link between a suspected case and infected patients. This epidemiologic link takes into account the incubation period of SARS, which is usually up to 10 days (11). Probable pediatric SARS cases have so far been shown to always have a well\u2010defined epidemiologic link with disease in adult family members occurring before the onset of disease in the child. In these situations, transmission occurs from the adult to the child rather than vice versa, as the adult is usually responsible for entry of the virus into the household.",

The precise duration of the viremic phase in unclear. However, it has been shown that virus can be detected in low amounts in the plasma on day 9 of illness (5). Besides respiratory secretions and plasma, viral RNA has been detected in a variety of clinical samples, including kidney and lung tissues, bone marrow and feces (3, 5). At this time, the extent to which SARS\u2010CoV persists in organs and tissues after initial infection is unclear. In one study, virus was present in sputum and plasma during the early stages of infection and in the stool during late convalescence (5). However, virus has also been detected in stool samples during the early stages of disease in patients presenting with diarrhea. During the SARS outbreaks, studies were in progress to delineate the stages of infection when virus is present in specific organs and tissues (respiratory secretions, blood, organs of the reticuloendothelial system, stool and urine).",
