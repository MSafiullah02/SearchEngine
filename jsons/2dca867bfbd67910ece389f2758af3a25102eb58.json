            "text": "Medical and surgical care has become increasingly complex as the number and severity of comorbidities has multiplied over the years. Concurrently, advances in the practice of anesthesiology have resulted from developments in the education and training of anesthesiologists, an expanded knowledge and evidence base, and remarkable innovations in equipment, technology, and pharmacotherapeutics. Anesthesia services are increasingly provided in remote locations outside of the operating room (OR), where the need for specialist care for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is also increasing. This increasing clinical load has challenged the ability of anesthesiologists to meet societal needs for both clinical care and academic productivity. The Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS) is committed to enhancing the quality of care for patients while improving the efficiency of anesthesiologists. The CAS welcomes the addition of competent and well trained healthcare professionals as part of an inter-professional team responsible for the delivery of perioperative anesthesia care.",

As such, it should be practised by physicians with appropriate training in anesthesia.\" However, just as the demographics of the Canadian public has changed, and patients presenting for medical care have similarly changed, and the expectations of care have changed. The simple model of anesthesia care defined 40 years ago has evolved in concert with these changes. The CAS recognizes that optimal care is no longer provided by sole practitioners, and that the model for care is now the \"patient-care\" team which encompasses the whole system of professionals providing patient care. In this model, the CAS has supported the development of the \"Anesthesia Care Team\" concept of care in which the specialist physician anesthesiologist practices with the assistance of a group of medical and paramedical personnel, including dedicated, trained, and certified Anesthesia Assistants. To ensure patient safety and optimal delivery of patient care in the perioperative setting it is essential that the practice of anesthesia continues to be based on a physician model of anesthesia care.",

The Guidelines state, \"it may be appropriate in specific circumstances for one anesthesiologist to supervise more than one case wherein solely RSS 1-3 sedation is administered, provided that an appropriately trained, qualified, and accredited individual, approved by the health care institution, is in constant attendance with each patient receiving care.\" In obstetric anesthesia care, our Guidelines state, \"Under the direction of an anesthesiologist, some aspects of monitoring and management of obstetric regional analgesia may be delegated to other health care personnel. Each facility should ensure that these personnel receive the same training, certification, continuing education, and recertification in obstetric regional analgesia.\" However, it is emphasized that \"Simultaneous administration of general, spinal, epidural, or other major regional anesthesia, or sedation level 4-6 (Ramsay Sedation Scale, see Appendix 6), by one anesthesiologist for concurrent diagnostic or therapeutic procedures on more than one patient is unacceptable.\" The CAS and Canadian anesthesiologists are proud of their high standard of clinical care and their reputation for the provision of safe anesthesia and such changes are not intended to jeopardize this principle.",

Several colleges have AA education programs but there is no national curriculum or certifying body. \u2022 In the United States of America, a variety of physician assistants have roles similar to the AA model described here. However, there are a variety of models of anesthesia care in the USA and direct comparison with Canadian roles is difficult \u2022 In the United Kingdom, the role of the 'Operating Department Practitioner' (a protected title) is regulated by the UK Health and Care Professions Council. The ODP functions in the OR and other critical care areas as an assistant in a variety of roles, some specifically dedicated to assisting the anesthesiologist. Training is through a diploma program in a number of universities. More recently the Royal College of Anaesthetists has sponsored the further development of the ODP specializing in anesthesia care, known as the 'Anesthetic Care Practitioner' or 'Physicians Assistant Anesthesia'. \u2022 Australia and New Zealand have mandated the dedication of a specific trained assistant to the anesthetist during the conduct of anesthesia.
