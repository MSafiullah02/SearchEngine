It has become a worldwide pandemic since it appeared in Wuhan in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human coronavirus, which affects primarily the respiratory tract. Severely ill patients suffer from pneumonia. They might need intensive care and artificial ventilation after developing acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The main human cellular receptor for the binding of the viral spike proteins is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), following activation by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is expressed by type II alveolar cells, the predominant portal of entry in the lungs; ACE2 is also expressed in the heart and vasculature. It is upregulated by ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for cardiac patients. Their influence on SARS-Cov-2 infectivity is unclear.",

The positive samples showed an increase in macrophage infiltration together with myocyte necrosis and SARS-CoV RNA expression by polymerase chain rection (PCR). It was associated with a reduction in ACE2 protein expression. In situ hybridization was not available, so that direct evidence of viral RNA in the myocytes is still missing.",

The troponin T level was >10,000 ng/l, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) 112.9 ng/l, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 21.025 ng/l. Echocardiography revealed an enlarged left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 58 mm and an ejection fraction of 28%. Computed tomography coronary angiography excluded coronary artery stenosis. The patient developed cardiogenic shock and was diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. He was ventilated and received a combination of methylprednisolone (200 mg/day), immunoglobulins (20 g/day), each for 4 days, norepinephrine and milrinone to stabilize blood pressure, and piperacillin sulbactam against bacterial superinfection. One week later, his heart size and cardiac marker enzymes had normalized.",
