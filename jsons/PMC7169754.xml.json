This signaling cascade leads to many downstream effects that facilitate both NO's local biologic activity as a vasodilator and neurotransmitter, as well as its distant impacts as an anti\u2010pyretic.23 NO can interact with many molecular targets, including protein thiols, heme, nonheme iron, tyrosyl radical proteins, deoxynucleotides, and deoxynucleosides.14 It can react with glutathione (GSH) and other thiol\u2010containing molecules to form S\u2010nitrosothiols (RSNOs), which function as NO carriers and donors.28 As a free radical, NO can generate potent nitrosylating agents capable of both signaling and cellular damage, such as peroxynitrite (OONO\u2212) in the presence of superoxide.23 This effect only occurs at higher concentrations, since as mentioned above, NO is rapidly scavenged in most physiological conditions.

They produce NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in response to inflammatory stimuli. This likely acts as one of the chief protective mechanisms of the skin, as the epidermis is constantly exposed to foreign matter and organisms. Additionally, NO synthesis on the skin surface may also regulate the growth of cutaneous commensal organisms.24 In the acidic skin environment, reactive nitrogen intermediates are formed, such as nitrous acid (HNO2), dinitrogen trioxide (H2NO3), and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which may serve as a nonspecific defense mechanism against cutaneous pathogens.30 In addition, finely regulated responses are also exhibited by NOS species; wound healing is one example. Fibroblasts, found in the dermis, are key regulators of dermal remodeling by synthesizing extracellular matrix, collagen, and fibrin, while orchestrating many of the complex steps of wound healing. Fibroblasts express eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS,24 but this expression is inconsistent across different cells and possibly depends on cell maturation. Due to its widespread distribution, NO can help regulate basic physiological roles such as establishing and maintaining blood flow, protective responses against invading microorganisms, ultraviolet light\u2010induced melanogenesis, and development of erythema and edema in the setting of a sunburn.24\n",

These RNOS include peroxynitrite (OONO\u2212), RSNOs, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3\n\u2212), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4).13, 19, 25 These RNOS are thought to exert NO's antimicrobial effects because they induce nitrosative and oxidative stress that is toxic to microbes.8 Peroxynitrite is formed during the oxidative burst in macrophages and is the most highly reactive and potentially cytotoxic of these RNOS.32 RNOS nitrosate protein thiols and modify amino acid residues and thus can inactivate essential enzymes.15 They can also nitrosylate metal centers (Fe\u2010S), further modifying protein functioning and depleting intracellular iron stores. These events ultimately block essential microbial processes.1, 21, 29, 33, 34 RNOS also damage microbial DNA, and they do so via a variety of mechanisms, including direct RNOS interaction with DNA, inhibition of DNA repair and replication, and increased synthesis of genotoxic mediators such as alkylating agents and H2O2.15, 28 OONO\u2212 can also induce DNA strand breaks and abasic sites, among other alterations.13, 21, 28 OONO\u2212 and NO2 have also been implicated in lipid damage and peroxidation with subsequent disruption of the microbial membrane.15, 33\n",

Sol\u2013gel refers to the transition of a system from a liquid \u2018sol\u2019 into a solid gel phase.23, 67 Sol\u2013\u2013gels are capable of trapping proteins and other large molecules, yet they remain porous to smaller molecules like NO, which can limit their drug delivery capabilities. To overcome this limitation and minimize porosity, glass\u2010forming sugars and polysaccharides like chitosan can be added during sol\u2013gel synthesis to essentially plug up these pores.23, 67 The resulting glassy properties are also of benefit because the matrix promotes the thermal reduction of nitrite to NO, as well as NO retention and sustained release.16, 23 The final NO\u2010np formulation is stored in a powder form. The NO remains trapped in the matrix when dry, permitting easy storage. Upon exposure to an aqueous environment, NO release is initiated as the nps swell from taking on water.4, 16, 31 The rate and total quantity of NO release can be modified by altering the synthesis steps, such as changing the concentration of nitrite or polyethylene glycol's (PEG) molecular weight and/or concentration.4, 15 For example, the utilization of larger PEGs increase pore size, allowing for a rapid bolus\u2010type NO release pattern, whereas NO\u2010nps made with smaller PEGs demonstrated a slower, sustained NO release over time. NO\u2010nps were minimally toxic to treated human lung fibroblasts and reconstituted human epidermis in vitro.16, 68 Human lung fibroblasts treated with NO\u2010nps in vitro demonstrated minimal toxicity compared to those cultured with media and control particles.
