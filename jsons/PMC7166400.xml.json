The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptor and membrane fusion, two key steps in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is a structural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of the coronavirus isolated during the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic: a higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat\u2010like SARS coronavirus but lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the 2019\u2010nCoV zoonotic transmission and its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These results do not exclude the fact that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, led by the epidemic evolution, could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus.",
