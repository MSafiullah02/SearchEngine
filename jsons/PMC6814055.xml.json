Direct sgRNA synthesis at commercial companies is a simple method to customize sgRNAs exception to being expensive (Fig. 1a). The conventional method of generating sgRNA is in vitro transcription using templates. The direct method to make the templates is to synthesize T7-sgRNA DNA fragments at commercial companies as transcription templates (Fig. 1b). To generate sgRNA transcription templates in lab usual either need a plasmid to construct a recombinant plasmid, or need to take plasmids as templates to amplify transcription templates through using a forward long primer and a reverse primer, which either is cumbersome and requires several steps to produces gRNAs or synthesis a long primer above 80 bp each time (Fig. 1c, d).\n",

The size of DNA template fragments of the three genes were around 120 bp. In Additional file 1: Table S3, the final combined fragment labeled by AF1-AF2-AF3-Tracr-R, the longest products, was the template of sgRNA and the size of expected DNA fragments similarly assembled by this means were 122 bp. In order to further verified the sequence of the templates, the PCR products were subcloned into PMD18-T vector and we chose three E. coli colonies to confirmed by Sanger\u2019s sequencing. The Fig. 3a\u2013c show the representative sequences of the transcription template of EGFR-Exon19, pu57-1, pu57-2. We demonstrated that the DNA templates of sgRNA synthesized were practicable by using this method. However, it is noteworthy that the design and concentrations of primers in the whole experiment are the key factors affecting the quality of products. In the process of PCR reaction, the concentrations of primers should be adjusted and tested according to the difference in the length of primers. After optimization, the overlapping primers of AF1, AF2, AF3, tracr-R were mixed at the ratios of 50:5:1:50 in the present study, which generated a single DNA fragment nearly with no intermediate products. These optimized parameters ease the synthesis of sgRNA templates with the same quality as commercial kit, but with time saving and less costly.",

As shown in Fig. 4b\u2013d, the results demonstrated that the three genes were successfully cleaved at the target sites and produced products at the sizes as expected in vitro based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The method established in the present study is feasible to explore gene function with site-specific mutation. In general, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used extensively to elucidate gene function through the regulation of gene expression [7, 8]. However, the conventional method of obtaining sgRNA is that design primers to amplify DNA fragment containing the target site from plasmid as template and then it is transcribed into sgRNA, which is more cumbersome and need long primers to amplify [9]. Here, the reported method in the present study only requires several short primers, containing approximately 20 bp overlapped sequence for assembling a complete fragment as template of sgRNA. This reported method is faster and more straightforward than conventional one. We demonstrated this approach was an effective tool for functional sgRNA synthesis in vitro. These in vitro synthesized sgRNAs work well for in vitro digestion of target genes, and have applications in mutation analysis, particularly for the cancer hotspot mutations lacking particular restrictive endonucleases.",

Three gene loci, xt.rtbdn, xt.Znf238.2 and xt.Znf238, were selected for these experiments (Additional file 1: Tables S1, S2). Following Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs co-injected into embryos of X. tropicalis, the PCR products of xt.rtbdn, xt.Znf238.2 and xt.Znf238 targeting sequences amplified from embryos genomic DNA were digested with T7 endonuclease I, and the fragments of digestion were analyzed by agarose gel as shown in Fig. 5a. The presence of mutated DNA fragments were clearly observed and identified as there were two segments by T7 enzyme digestion on the agarose gel. To further confirmed the sgRNAs efficiency, another method was applied to assay the targeted disrupted rate after co-injecting Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs into embryos. The PCR products of xt.rtbdn, xt.Znf238.2 and xt.Znf238 targeting sequences amplified from embryos genomic DNA were used for TA cloning and sequencing. Twenty single colonies were sent to DNA sequencing analysis. The frequency of indels mutations accumulated in the target site of xt.rtbdn, xt.Znf238.2 and xt.Znf238 loci were calculated as described before [7, 8]. As showing in Fig. 5b\u2013d, the frequency of indels mutations in xt.rtbdn, xt.Znf238.2 and xt.Znf238 gene loci are 88.9%, 94.4% and 89.5%, respectively.
