They have no counterpart at the level of any one patient or study and cannot be directly measured. There was no ability nor purpose to adjust for the underlying patient-level risk. There was considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, populations, and study designs among the studies here as the inclusion criteria for the various studies have been intentionally broadly specified. In this regard, a strength of the analysis is that the heterogeneity among the studies here generally resembles that expected among ICU populations to which these interventions might be targeted.",
