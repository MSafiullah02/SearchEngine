            "text": "Designing side chain substituents complementary to enzyme binding pockets is of great importance in the construction of potent and selective phosphinic dipeptide inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases. Proper structure selection makes inhibitor construction more economic, as the development process typically consists of multiple iterative preparation/bioassay steps. On the basis of these principles, using noncomplex computation and modeling methodologies, we comprehensively screened 900 commercial precursors of the P1 residues of phosphinic dipeptide and dehydrodipeptide analogs to identify the most promising ligands of 52 metallo-dependent aminopeptidases with known crystal structures. The results revealed several nonproteinogenic residues with an improved energy of binding compared with the best known inhibitors. The data are discussed taking into account the selectivity and stereochemical implications of the enzymes. Using this approach, we were able to identify nontrivial structural elements substituting the recognized phosphinic peptidomimetic scaffold of metallo-aminopeptidase inhibitors.",

            "text": "Phosphinic dipeptides are generally acknowledged as transition-state analog inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases [1] [2] [3] , a large and homogenous class of exopeptidases that specifically cleave the N-terminal amino acid residues of polypeptides and proteins and contain metal ion(s) in their active sites. Being ubiquitously distributed in subcellular organelles, cytoplasm, and cellular membranes throughout all of the biological kingdoms, these enzymes perform critical roles in physiological processes and diseases. In humans, they are responsible for processing peptides and proteins involved in, for example, angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cancer and metastasis, blood pressure regulation, and bacterial and protozoal infections [3] [4] [5] . The inhibitory potential of phosphinic dipeptides originates from two fundamental structural features that determine the competitive mechanism of binding, and govern the potency and specificity of the ligands. First, the presence of the central phosphinic functional group ensures steric and electronic resemblance to the scissile amide bond of hydrolyzed substrates in the tetrahedral transition state. This also involves the ability to coordinate with catalytic metal ion(s). Second, the optimized structures of the P1 and P1 side chains guarantee complementarity to the corresponding S1 and S1 binding pockets (encryptions according to the nomenclature proposed by Schechter and Berger to define the N-terminal, non-primed and C-terminal, primed residues of the scissile amide bond in peptide substrates, and the corresponding binding pockets [6] ).",

The family contains enzymes widely occurring in living organisms, including alanyl, cystinyl, and lysyl aminopeptidases; leukotriene A4 hydrolase; and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases I and II [70] . These enzymes play different physiological roles and are also targets for treating various pathological states. Nine M1 aminopeptidases have been identified in humans, six of which have been associated with disorders [69] . For example, their altered activity has been connected with regulation of blood pressure controlling systems, resulting in hypertension and strokes [71] . M1 aminopeptidases are also involved in cancer development [69] . In particular, APN has been shown to be overexpressed in leukemia blasts in acute myeloid leukemia. APN is active in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis [72] . LTA4H has been associated with acute lung damage, while dysregulation of ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP can reflect the risk of autoimmune diseases. M1 aminopeptidases are receptors for viruses, for example, coronaviruses [73] . They are also connected with several infections caused by bacteria, for example, meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitides [74] , or protozoans, for example, malaria transmitted by Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite aminopeptidase of this species is involved in the digestion of short hemoglobin-derived peptides and has been rated as a highly prospective therapeutic target [75, 76] .",

            "text": "Enzyme Name P1 Amino Acids of S1 In accordance with the overall character of S1 pockets, the best docking scores for M1 aminopeptidases were achieved for bulky aromatic and heteroaromatic P1 substituents (Table 3) . Although \u03c0-conjugated systems are naturally hydrophobic, certain modifications with heteroatoms/ functional groups tighten binding with the enzyme active site by making specific contacts. In some cases of sterically extended residues, the fit appeared so close that the S1 pocket seemed virtually \"stoppered\" in docking experiments. Rotational freedom in phosphinic dipeptides positively influenced the energy of binding. These analogs were more frequently represented among the top compounds compared with their P1 -unsaturated counterparts. Nevertheless, a couple of enzymes appeared to favor dehydropeptides among the dozen listed in Table 3 . Regarding stereochemistry, the R,S diastereoisomers of phosphinic dipeptides prevailed, and this result is consistent with the relative configuration l,l of natural substrates. For the dehydro analogs, the E geometry was somewhat favored. Table 3 . Selected members of the M1 family with preferred P1 substituents (R, compare Figure 1 ) that were the most favored, had the best interaction with the catalytic metal ion via the phosphinate group, and were the most specific (compare explanation in the text) are shown. The stereochemistry of the ligands and the calculated Gibbs free energy of binding to the active center are included. Known inhibitors are given as the references, with inhibition potency (K i or IC 50 compound could not be considered specific. Phosphinic inhibitors with P1 aromatic rings functionalized with hydroxyl groups have been recognized as good inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases [7] , as OH in the para position is well positioned to form hydrogen contacts with the carboxylate of Glu418. Flexibility of the side chain directs the aromatic ring towards Val385 and His388. Stacking of the ring with imidazole is facilitated by oxygen-containing groups, which change its character by the electron-withdrawal effect. The distance of 4.04 \u00c5 to the aromatic ring of Tyr477 causes additional stabilization through hydrophobic interactions. The C-terminal carboxyl group is pointed to Gly352. The compound has a nonnatural configuration on the \u03b1 carbon of the P1 fragment. This is not significant, as both arrangements gave rise to very similar inhibition potential. It is also typical to observe the 2-phenylethyl fragment of hPhe-based inhibitors; because of its high flexibility, the absolute configuration does not determine the activity [84] . The most specific compound, whose structure is based on the 5-amino-thiophen-2-yl residue, reproduces an interaction with Glu418 (involving NH 2 ), but the heteroaromatic ring is less conveniently positioned compared with His388 ( Figure S1 ). The P1 fragment is brought closer to the surface of the cavity, strengthening the influence of Thr384 and Val385. To our satisfaction, the binding energy calculated for a phosphinic dipeptide that was rationally designed, synthesized, and described in our previous studies (K i = 0.69 nM) outscored the current structures [8] . However, starting materials with the specific P1 fragment (4-aminomethylphenyl) are not commercially available, and compound development demands a complex and multistep preparation. This can be considered an exception. In general, the structure proposed here surpasses known inhibitors.",

The M1 metallopeptidase family is 1 of 29 formally classified families and one of only three families in which the crystal structures of human enzymes were determined ( Table 1 ). The other two families are M18 and M24. The functions of human M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase are still poorly understood. It participates in blood pressure regulation and maintenance of proper hydroelectrolytic balance, and it has also been associated with angiogenesis in breast cancer [85] . The active center of M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase contains two metal ions and is open to the central tunnel formed of 12 subunits. This gives the protein the opportunity to bind long peptides in a number of consecutive pockets. The S1 pocket is arranged to bind asparagine or glutamine, while the S1 pocket prefers small alkyl chain-type amino acid residues (Table 4) . Human M24 aminopeptidases can be divided into two subgroups, namely methionine metallo-aminopeptidases and Xaa-Pro aminopeptidases. The two subgroups are differentiated based on the presence or absence of a common fold called the \"pitta bread\". Similar to other aminopeptidases, their substrate specificity is broad [86] . The catalytic centers contain two cobalt or manganese ions. The enzymes differ in amino acid preferences and active site architecture (Table 4) .

The detailed molecular modeling analysis revealed that none of these compounds were able to bind in a substrate-like manner. For example, nominal P1 substituents found for aspartyl aminopeptidase (3,4-dibenzyloxyphenyl), methionyl aminopeptidase 2 (4-borono-2,3-difluorophenyl), and aminopeptidase P3 (3-phenylaziridin-2-yl) had a tendency to occupy the S1 pockets, not the S1 pockets, showing a distorted binding mode. This distortion involved interactions of the carboxylate group with the metal ions, and the C-terminal position was held by the phosphinate. The S1 cleft of aspartyl aminopeptidase was able to adopt unexpectedly bulky polyaromatic residues, which were surrounded by the alkyl residues of Lys358, Leu405, Val407, Pro412, Cys413, and His359 (\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking) ( Figure S8 ). Tyr381 formed a hydrogen bond with an ether oxygen atom. For aminopeptidase P3, 3-phenylaziridin interacted with the catalytic residues Pro301 and Asp331 (NH of aziridine) and His413 and Arg438 ( Figure S9 ). For methionyl aminopeptidase 2, the ligand did not typically point towards Met384, but docked in the shallow part of the S1 cleft, close to catalytic amino acids ( Figure  S10 ). The phenyl ring and fluorine atoms interacted with His231 and His382, while the boronyl group formed numerous hydrogen bonds with Ser224, Lys249, and Gln457. In all three discussed cases, the P1 phenylethyl fragment was nonspecifically arranged.",

            "text": "Enzyme Name P1 Amino Acids of S1 M17 mixed type A/I aminopeptidase from Helicobacter pylori, in addition to urease (Nobel Prize in Medicine for Marshall and Warren in 2005 [95] ), is among the potential targets for organophosphorus inhibitors. This bizinc-dependent enzyme has a wide active center arranged for peptides with long side chains [51] , but the S1 preferences have not yet been specified. Nevertheless, good docking results were obtained for compounds with boronyl groups ( Table 7) . The 3-boronyl-6-ethoxyphenyl substituent proved the best dehydrodipeptide analog inhibitor, with a binding mode similar to that of bestatin ( Figure 8 ). The P1 group of hPhe is arranged in S1 and interacts with Met278 and Tyr433 of another enzyme subunit. The P1 substituent also fills the corresponding cavity very well. Tyr274 interacts with the boronyl group by a hydrogen bond, while the aromatic ring and ethoxy group form hydrophobic interactions. Lys270 plays a role in stabilizing the transition state of peptide bond hydrolysis; accordingly, it binds with its amino group to the central phosphinate moiety. Table 7 . Selected bacterial metallo-aminopeptidases with P1 substituents that were the most favored, had the best interaction with the catalytic metal ion via the phosphinate group, and were the most specific are shown. The stereochemistry of the ligands and the calculated Gibbs free energy of binding in the active center are included. Known inhibitors are given as references. The M17 enzymes are also characteristic of bacteria of the Pseudomonas genus, which are responsible for endogenous infections of individuals with reduced immunity, including pneumonia, among other microorganisms that express metallo-aminopeptidases and are involved in respiratory diseases, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (M18), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M24), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (M42). The best pseudodipeptide that interacts with metal ions of glutamyl M42 aminopeptidase via phosphinate functionality is based on the 4-(difluoromethoxy)-3-hydroxyphenyl P1 fragment. Its orientation is reversed in the active center, similar to the aspartyl-specific enzyme (Figure 9 ). The C-terminal carboxylate is exposed to Arg257 and Ser238. The P1 aromatic ring fits perfectly in the S1 pocket by multiple hydrophobic interactions with Pro239, Ile317, and catalytic His318. The docking is strengthened by additional halogen bonding of carbonyl Gly90.",

Selected ADMET properties predicted for the inhibitors of M1 aminopeptidases validate their druglikeness ( Table 8, the full table is included in Supplementary  Information, Table S2 ). Lipinski's rule of five is fulfilled, as the compounds are relatively small (MW only in rare cases exceeds 500) and moderately lipophilic (logP from \u22121.6 to 3.3). The pseudopeptidic phosphinic backbone is a source of four hydrogen bond acceptors and one donor. These basic numbers may be increased for the heteroatoms comprised by the substituents. Water solubility and gastrointestinal absorption are variable. In summary, in addition to the biological activity, phosphinic dipeptide analogs possess the physicochemical properties needed for drug candidates, opening opportunities to use phosphinic dipeptide analogs in the treatment of a spectrum of diseases. The results of our screening can be considered as qualitative. Globally, there is no significant correlation between experimental affinities of the described inhibitors and the corresponding values of the computed free Gibbs energy. Too many variables influence the reported data based on experimental procedures (e.g., different protocols of inhibition measurements and calculations) and the data based on calculations (structural, stereochemical, and conformational implications, for both enzymes and ligands). Nevertheless, regressions that involved limited datasets showed clearer tendencies. For the first relationship, we selected the universal inhibitor (bestatin), which was assayed with several aminopeptidases, and prepared the plot of \u2206G versus pK i ( Table 9 ). Although the correlation coefficient for the linear regression is not remarkable (R 2 = 0.65), the trend is visible. Much more pronounced correlation (R 2 = 0.91) was envisaged for the specified type of inhibitors (phosphinic (dehydro)dipeptide analogs) and a single aminopeptidase (human aminopeptidase N, M01.001, Figure 11 ). Although these compounds were tested as a diastereomeric mixture [8, 10] , while the binding energies were calculated for the best single diastereoisomers, the obtained fit to linear regression is remarkable.
