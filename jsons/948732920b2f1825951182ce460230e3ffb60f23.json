It is the battle of the analog vs. digital -humans brain store information as varying threads and 'learn' and evolve based on previous experiences; a computer by contrast sees memory as a binary collection of ones and zeroes. Scientists working in this space of artificial intelligence now realize that storing memory as varying threads of information, rather than as binary digits is the key to making computers 'more human. ' Memory is everything when we choose a computer, yet the capacity to remember is the least important in selecting a mate as a human companion. When we go to the computer store, devices tout memories of 4GB or 16GB of RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM may help a computer multi-task but any arrest in the power supply leads to a rapid unraveling of memory (at least until the last 'auto-save'!). Enter memory-resistors, or 'memristors' -electronic components where electrical resistance is not constant as in standard resistors, but is determined by the history of the electric current that has previously flowed through it. In other words, a memristor \"remembers\" like a human brain. Researchers working at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the University of California in Santa Barbara claim to have constructed the world's first electronic memory cell that effectively mimics the analog process of the human brain -and with it comes the possibility and peril of a truly bionic brain. However, there exist some significant hurdles -when it comes to memory, speed alone isn't the problem -artificial intelligence (AI) will need to come up with new ways to match the 2C's of brain function -complexity and consciousness.",

Dougherty (then in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of California at Berkeley), who had worked extensively with the organism.

This soil worm had excited scientists as it had many attributes that made it a natural model for scientific study -for a start, it is barely over 1 mm in length, lives for approximately three days, feeds on easily cultivated bacteria such as E. coli and a single Petri-dish can hold over 10,000 of these critters.

Using a similar technique (as in the C. elegans research), his team began studying the neural networks of rat brains -with a goal of computer-based models that mirror the rat brain's complex biological networks. \"Technologically, in terms of computers and techniques to acquire data, it will be possible to build a model of the human brain within 10 years,\" Markram has been quoted saying. 12 Yuval Harari, debates the transition or rather our progress as a species from evolution by Natural Selection to evolution by Intelligent Design. He calls this 'the greatest revolution in thousands of years of history, but also the greatest revolution in billions of years of biology.' Harari, in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind writes about the many positive aspects of intelligent design 13 :",

Biodesigners could re-engineer the shapes, abilities and desires of organisms, in order to realize some preconceived cultural idea. There is nothing new about biological engineering, per se. People have been using selective breeding, castration and other forms of bio-engineering for at least 10,000 years. But recent advances in our understanding of how organisms work, down to the cellular and genetic levels, have opened up previously unimaginable possibilities. For example, scientists can today take a gene from a jellyfish that glows in a green florescent light, and implant it in a rabbit or a monkey, which starts glowing in a green florescent light. E. coli bacteria have been genetically engineered to produce human insulin and bio-fuel. A gene extracted from an arctic fish has been inserted into potatoes, making the plants more frost resistant.",

A group of elderly men were taken to a 'reminiscence retreat' outside Boston. The first group was the 'control group' and spent a week simply reminiscing about the Fifties. The second group, however, was taken back in time and surrounded by objects from the Fifties and asked to behave as if it really was 1959. Over the week, something astonishing happened. The men stopped using their walking sticks, they began to walk faster and their posture improved. What this experiment demonstrated is that as humans we are more than genes and brains. We have a collective consciousness. Pemberton is skeptical that computer code could replace medicine. \"Computers are a useful tool in treatment, but medicine is far too complex to be reduced to code,\" he says 14 . Like me, Pemberton is a medical doctor and this may only turn out to be wishful thinking. Technically it will soon be possible to create artificial versions of our brains and implant them into all kinds of inorganic models. Given a choice, you could take on any form that you wish. The question more to the point would be: What do you want to become? But with your brain and without your existing form, would that really be you?",

In an essay titled, 'Build-a-Brain' he describes how human brains perceive objects. For example, if we were to look at a tennis ball bouncing, we would note its color, shape, how high it bounced, the variability of the bounce etc. Our brain constructs something like a dossier, a dataset that is constantly revised as new signals come in. This is what scientists refer to as the \"internal model.\" However, if we were to ask a robot a few questions regarding the tennis ball, Graziano suggests that the conversation would go something like this 18 : Singularity will not be achieved. But what if humans could 'lend' a computer some conscious awareness? This has led scientists to develop braincomputer interfaces (BCI). In a first-of-its-kind study, engineers and neuroscientists in India and France recently demonstrated the viability of direct brain-to-brain communication in humans. They successfully transmitted information (words like 'hola' and ciao') via the Internet between intact scalps of two human subjects -located 5,000 miles apart. Explaining their methods in PLOS ONE, they say 19 : By using advanced precision neuro-technologies including wireless EEG and robotized TMS (trans-cranial magnetic stimulation), we were able to directly and noninvasively transmit a thought from one person to another, without them having to speak or write One of the reasons consciousness has been elusive for otherwise intelligent robots is that consciousness (or to the philosopher, the psyche) is everywhere. Neuroscientist Christof Koch, chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, talks about the theory of panpsychism -put simply, we are just a mind (or soul) in a world of minds. This was a theory espoused by thinkers like Plato and Spinoza, only to be sidelined by modern society's quest for empiric science. But a failure to infuse computers with consciousness has reignited this debate. According to Koch, consciousness arises within any sufficiently complex, information-processing system and the solution to Singularity may lie in us being connected. In an interview with Wired magazine 20 (rather appropriate, don't you think), he noted:",

So the Internet has at least 10 19 transistors, compared to the roughly 1000 trillion (or quadrillion) synapses in the human brain. That's about 10,000 times more transistors than synapses. But is the internet more complex than the human brain? It depends on the degree of integration of the Internet\u2026 For instance, our brains are connected all the time. On the Internet, computers are packet-switching. They're not connected permanently, but rapidly switch from one to another\u2026 Therefore, consciousness = connectivity. Therein lies the future. Technology now has the capability of making humans communicate via computers without using any of their traditional five senses. Genomes have been mapped. Artificial brains have been created for worms and mice that transmit their behaviors to inorganic hosts, even Lego models. We also have the capability to use our thoughts to control robotic bodies. Even if Singularity isn't here yet, we have reached a new level of human-machine interaction as a halfway measure towards achieving the ultimate goal. For now, this human-computer seems the immediate future and one that will help computers 'learn' our way. Will the future be dystopian and Utopian? Time will tell. However, I must say this -when I read Utopia I felt uneasy about the sameness of society portrayed therein. I am not worried about Singularity as long as artificial intelligence can be varied, moody, altruistic and joyful. Isn't life about celebrating differences?",
