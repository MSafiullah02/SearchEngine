During the West Africa Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015, ID physicians served as leaders of special biocontainment units at the National Institutes of Health, University of Nebraska, Emory University, and Bellevue Hospital. These units and their staff developed novel, sophisticated infection prevention strategies to care for patients with potentially deadly infections. They reassured medical providers, political leaders, and our nation\u2019s public by providing safe, state-of-the-art care. In Seattle, Washington, an ID physician reported an outbreak of deadly, multidrug-resistant carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections were attributed to contaminated, faulty duodenoscopes. This investigation helped lead to changes in guidance on endoscope reprocessing and safety [21, 22]. An ID physician at Vanderbilt University identified contaminated steroids as the source of a fungal meningitis outbreak that ultimately caused more than 700 infections and 46 deaths across 20 states before the cause was established [23, 24].",

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant organisms kill more than 23 000 people and result in $20 billion in unnecessary healthcare costs each year in the United States [18]. Newer antimicrobials will be precious resources, and ID physician\u2013driven expertise will be vital to ensure that they are being used appropriately. A recent Clinical Infectious Diseases article highlighted the unique skill set and training ID physicians have to lead antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in order to ensure that correct antimicrobials are used judiciously [25]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have acknowledged the impact and importance of ASPs in their release of the Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs in 2014 [26], and the Joint Commission released their antimicrobial stewardship standard for healthcare settings in 2017. In 2014, legislation was passed in California that mandated that every acute care hospital in the state establish a physician-supervised ASP [27]. Adoption of a federal government requirement that other states follow suit would help to ensure that all patients can benefit from the positive impact of ASPs. ASPs will become increasingly vital in preventing a post-antibiotic era where common infections become untreatable due to resistant organisms. ID physicians need to take an active role in ensuring their facilities have adequate ASPs that meet the standards laid out by the CDC and Joint Commission. Well-run ASPs not only help preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials but also improve patient outcomes. In fact, studies have indicated that ASPs generated several hundred thousand dollars a year in cost savings while also reducing rates of Clostridium difficile infections [28, 29]. It is vital that the government continue to support the implementation of ID-led ASPs in all healthcare settings to slow the development of resistance and to keep our current antimicrobials useful for as long as possible.",

These activities substantially increased with the appearance of the SARS, MERS\u2013coronavirus, and Ebola virus epidemics. ID physicians provided scientific and clinical expertise that shaped prevention, control, detection, and treatment efforts. Natural disasters also carry an increased risk of outbreaks of unusual, serious infections, as seen in connection with the hurricanes and flooding in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, which led to more than 70 reported cases of leptospirosis and other waterborne and vectorborne diseases [30]. ID physicians also played a leading role in infection prevention at large-scale shelters for people who had been displaced by storms and flooding. Hospital and healthcare system emergency preparedness requires an intimate knowledge of hospital infection control procedures and capacities, regional collaboration with other facilities, planning with public health authorities, and development of communication strategies within the hospital community, with public health departments, and with the general public.",
