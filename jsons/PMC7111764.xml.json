            "text": "A wide variety of physical and chemical techniques have been used to study ligand\u2013DNA binding, from the simple measurement of UV absorption and melting temperature to highly informative methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) [1], [2], [3], X-ray [4], [5], mass spectrometry (MS) [6], circular dichroism (CD) [7], gel footprinting [8], [9], fluorescence [3], equilibrium dialysis [10], and capillary electrophoresis (CE) [11], [12], [13]. However, NMR, X-ray, MS, CD and fluorescence not only require expensive equipments and elaborate procedures for sample purification prior to analysis, but also are tedious, time-consuming, and requiring a large sample size. Among the above-mentioned methods, CE is a powerful method with low sample consumption and short analysis time for studying the interactions of DNA-drugs [11]. Many biomolecule interacting systems such as protein\u2013DNA, DNA\u2013peptide, protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013drug, antibody\u2013antigen, peptide\u2013drug, peptide\u2013carbohydrate, peptide\u2013dye and carbohydrate\u2013drug have been studied using CE techniques [14]. As a new method combining the CE technology and the microfluidic platform, microchip electrophoresis has the potential to study molecular interactions [15]. There are few reports on characterization or quantification determination of the binding constants by microchip-based electrophoresis [16], [17], and there is no report for the study of the interactions between DNA and small molecules by microchip electrophoresis.",

The manipulation and transportation of analytes in microchip devices is based on electrokinetic phenomena, e.g., electrophoretic and electroosmotic effects. Buffer and sample flow within the channel network can be precisely controlled through high voltages applied on the buffer/sample reservoirs. The technique allows the manipulation of picoliter volumes with high precision that ultimately leads to performance equivalent to or exceeding current techniques. In contrast to conventional CE, the higher surface-to-volume ratio in microchip devices results in better heat dissipation, therefore, allows separations at higher field strengths. In a word, compared with conventional bench-scale systems, the advantages of microchip electrophoresis are numerous, such as less reagent consumption, low manufacturing costs, increased performance, faster analysis, high sample throughput, integration and automation possibility, and disposability [29], [30].",

However, recent discovery showed that the sequence-specific ActD binding to single strand DNA (ssDNA) could inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase and other polymerase [33]. Drugs with high selection for single-stranded forms of the HIV genome should cause minimal damage to the host genome DNA. ActD could inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and other polymerase. This result provides useful information for the treatment of new disease caused by some new viruses. The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a new viral RNA coronavirus with single-stranded forms of SARS genome that causes an acute respiratory illness in this century [21]. It is worth studying whether or not ActD also play a role in inhibiting SARS-CoV.",

To obtain a good spray, it was necessary to add 25% methanol to the injected solution. Methanol was added just before injection, after the complexation equilibrium in NH4OAc was established. The solutions containing noncovalent complexes, single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA were infused at 3 \u03bcL/min directly into the mass spectrometer. The spray voltage was 4.0 kV.

Multipole 1 offset voltage was 7 V. Multipole 2 offset voltage was 10.5 V. Entrance lens was 90 V. The N2 bath gas flow was increased by approximately 1.5 times volume more than that normally used for electrospray at 200 \u00b0C to ensure efficient desolvation. The analyzer was operated at a background pressure of 1.79 \u00d7 10\u22125\n Torr, as measured by a remote ion gauge. In all experiments, helium was introduced to an estimated pressure of 1 mTorr for improving the trapping efficiency.

The peak height of each sample was proportional to the concentration of ssDNA or dsDNA. The relationships between peak height and ssDNA or dsDNA concentration could be expressed as y\n = 252.59x\n \u2212 1.73 (r\n = 0.998) and y\n = 1151.7x\n + 0.55 (r\n = 0.997), respectively.

Fig. 2\nshows electropherograms of 0.05 \u03bcM 18-mer dsDNA mixed with various concentrations of ActD. When a mixture of ssDNA or dsDNA and ActD was injected into the channel of microchip, SYTOX orange dye in the buffer intercalated the 18-mer ssDNA or dsDNA, and thus the ssDNA or dsDNA could be detected. Then the dye could not intercalate ActD, which could not be detected in the assay. With increasing the concentrations of ActD, the peak heights of ssDNA or dsDNA fall as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. Since the fluorescent dye reacted with free DNA, the observed signals represent the fraction which did not bind to ActD. When the concentration of ActD was excessive, the peaks of ssDNA and dsDNA could be not detected. This is a basic for the quantitative determination. The ActD contributed positive charges to DNA, therefore, the complex became neutral or near-neutral. As a result, through an electro-migration injection mode, the complex might not be loaded into separation channel or, although there were a few complexes injected, separation time was too short to detect them in the separation conditions using the dynamoelectric injection mode.",

Because the ion-trap instrument here we used has an upper mass limit of m/z 2000, we could not get the whole charge distribution for each species. So, the ration of the abundance of the even-charge complex to that of the even-charge free single or duplex was used to evaluate the binding affinity. The result in Fig. 4A shows that the ration of the even-charge ssDNA\u2013ActD complex/the even-charge free ssDNA is approximately 3, which indicates that there is stronger binding affinity between ActD and 18-mer single-stranded DNA (5\u2032\u20133\u2032). Then, the results in Fig. 4B show that the ration of the even-charge dsDNA\u2013ActD complex/the even-charge free dsDNA is only nearly one fourth, which is significantly less than the former, and there are formation of 1:2 oligonucleotide duplex/ActD complexes and 1:1 oligonucleotide single/ActD complexes.
