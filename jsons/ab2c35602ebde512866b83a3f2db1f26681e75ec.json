While such data has been used in various countries, the changes in mobility patterns in Japan where interventions were limited to non-compulsory measures, has been under-studied. Here, we analyzed the temporal changes in i) human mobility behavior changes, ii) rates of social contacts, and iii) correlations of such mobility changes with the transmissibility of COVID-19, using anonymized large scale mobility data collected from more than 200K mobile phones in Tokyo, Japan. Our analysis concludes that by April 15th (1 week from declaring state of emergency), human mobility behavior had decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the effectiveness of non-compulsory measures. Furthermore, the reduction in human mobility metrics and social contact measures showed significant correlation with the decrease of the effective reproduction number of COVID-19.",

Countries around the world have tackled this challenge with a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from complete regional lockdowns, closures of non-essential businesses, to testing and tracing 2 .

Previous studies on human mobility analysis has shown that such large-scale mobility data collected from mobile devices (e.g. GPS, call detail records) may be used to assist the modeling of epidemic spread [4] [5] [6] [7] . During the current COVID-19 crisis, researchers from academia, industry, and governments agencies have started to utilize large-scale mobility datasets to estimate the effectiveness of control measures in various countries including China, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

However, we lack studies that have analyzed the mobility behavioral changes in Japan, and further analyzed the correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Japan, in particular, has experienced a significantly low number of patients and deaths due to COVID-19 in comparison to other countries in Europe and America, despite the social and physical proximity to China and intervention policies that are not as aggressive as some of the other countries 18, 19 . NPIs implemented by the Japanese government include non-mandatory closures and remote-working of nonessential business employees (February 26th), closures of public elementary, junior high and high schools (March 2nd), and incremental inbound entry restrictions, starting with personnel who have visited Hubei Province, China (February 3rd), until restricting inbound visitors from 73 countries (April 3rd). In the case of Japan, the current justice system does not allow the government to lay out a mandatory lockdown. Such differences in policies and COVID-19 spread dynamics make Japan an interesting case study for comparative analysis. The objective of this report is to provide empirical analysis on the effects of such non-compulsory NPIs on changes in i) individual mobility behavior and ii) amount of social contacts, and to iii) analyze the correlations between such mobility changes and transmissibility of COVID-19. In this study, large-scale mobility data collected from more than 200K mobile phones across a four month period in Tokyo are used to answer the aforementioned research questions.",

Mobile phone data were interpolated to produce movement trajectories, and the locations of the users at 12PM on each day were spatially aggregated into 100 meter grid cells. The population density was corrected by the number of observed users on each day, as the number of active users had daily fluctuations. As shown in previous studies 20 , we observe high population density along the railway lines and hub stations during the daytime. Comparing the three panels, we observe significant decrease in population density at stations and cities along the Yamanote-line (ring railway), such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabara, and Tokyo Stations. By April 14th, which was 1 week after the declaration of state of emergency, these hub stations had a 76% to 87% decrease in foot traffic compared to the baseline, which was computed by taking the average population density of weekdays at 12PM before the crisis (January 2020). Figure 1D shows the timeline of the COVID-19 response and occurrence of patients in Tokyo Metropolis. Green bars show the number of new patients for each day, blue annotations show inbound travel restrictions, and gray annotations list the policy interventions by the Japanese Government. The number of patients for each day were obtained from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government website 3 . Major non-pharmaceutical measures taken by the government include issuing non compulsory requests for remote working to private companies on February 26th, and closing public schools (elementary, junior high, high schools) from March 2nd until the end of the semester, which is usually the end of March (https: //www.mhlw.go.jp/english/).

            "text": "Here, we evaluate how individual users' mobility behavior has changed before and after the state of emergency in Tokyo, Japan. Figure 2 shows the transitions of various metrics of individual mobility patterns. Panels A and B in Figure 2 show the mean and median values of the radius of gyration (RG) and total travel distance (TTD), which characterize the magnitude and extent of individual mobility behavior 21 (see Methods). We observe two steps of decrease in both metrics, the first starting around the end of February and stabilizing until late March, and the second which is a more rapid decrease until April 15th. Both the mean and median values of RG and TTD have been reduced by 50% of the typical values by the end of the observation period on April 15th. Panels C and D in Figure 2 show the cumulative probability distribution plots for both mobility metrics across three different dates, January 20th (before the outbreak), March 30th (before the state of emergency), and April 14th (after the state of emergency), which are all Mondays. The RG values observe a dip at around 20km, which corresponds to the diameter of the Tokyo Metropolitan area (scale shown in Figure 1A -C). This implies that while the majority of the individuals move within the metropolitan area, some individuals travel to different regions outside Tokyo. In both mobility metrics, we observe significant tempering of the tail probability as time passes. This indicates a decrease in relatively long distance travelers (> 20km for radius of gyration and > 100km in total travel distance), reflecting the decrease and closures of airlines and inter-urban railways that travel outside the metropolitan Tokyo area. Figure 1 E shows the rates of users staying \u03ba meters within their estimated home locations. This figure suggests that the rate of people staying close to their estimated home locations increased since mid-March and doubled by April 15th regardless of the threshold value \u03ba, reflecting the increase in people working from home and spending time within their neighborhoods. Figure 3 shows the results of the social contact analysis in Tokyo over the observation period (see Methods). The panel figures show the temporal transitions in the relative average social contact index. The contact index is calculated by tracking the number of individual users that each user encounters in a given temporal window, using the interpolated trajectory data. We have used 100 meters as the spatial threshold parameter for detecting encounters for this analysis. The social contact indexes 3/9 were normalized by the mean peak contact index values observed prior to the outbreak (January 2020). Thus, in Figure 3 , contact index value of 1 indicates the average amount of observed contacts during peak hours on a typical weekday prior to the outbreak. The temporal periodicity in Figure 3 A shows the daily and weekly patterns, including the highest point showing the morning rush hour peak, the following peak showing the returning home rush hour, and significantly small amount of contacts (around 0.2) on weekends and holidays, including the New Year breaks. Panels B and C in Figure 3 show the total daily contact index and the daily peak contact index values, respectively. By comparing the average social contacts across the time horizon, we can observe in Figure 3 A that the average amount of social contact for each user starts to decrease as COVID-19 became a threat globally in mid February down to 90% of the typical value. The value decreases more rapidly towards the end of February with the government request for remote working, down to 65% of the typical values. The contact index stays at 65% of typical values until the end of March, and as the number of patients in Tokyo start to increase (Figure 1 ), the contact index further starts to decrease and reaches 30% of typical values by April 15th, almost reaching the government's goal of reducing social contacts by 80% of the typical values 22 . However, regarding the daily peak contacts (morning rush hour peaks on weekdays and lunchtime peaks on weekends and holidays), Panel C shows that peak time social contacts have decreased successfully to around 20% of the typical values by April 15th.",

Panel F further shows the log-log plot between the relative contact index on April 15th and average taxable income per household for each ward in Tokyo. The average taxable income per household was calculated using data provided by the Official Statistics of Japan through the Portal Site (https: //www.e-stat.go.jp/en/regional-statistics/ssdsview/municipality).

Panels D-F in Figure 4 show the temporal evolution of the mobility metrics and R(t), where each dot corresponds to daily values. We tested the correlation between each of the mobility metrics and estimated R(t) values within the period of decreasing R(t), which is between March 15th and April 1st, which are annotated in Panels D -F. All panels show significant (p < 0.0001, denoted by *** in the figures) and strong correlation (R > 0.820) between R(t) and mobility indexes during the time period where R(t) decreases. We further observe that R(t) < 1.0 is achieved with reduction in social contacts down to 0.326 on April 1st, and that further reduction in mobility and social contacts may not result in reduction of the transmissibility of COVID-19. This implies that restrictions on mobility certainly allow the reduction of number of transmissions up to a point but severe restrictions do not add further value. Thus, a more targeted and nuanced approach is needed to determine where and when mobility restrictions should be imposed.",

In this study, we utilized such data to quantify the changes in human mobility behavior and social contacts during the COVID-19 spread in Japan, which provides a unique case study where government policies were limited to non-compulsory measures. The analysis concludes 4/9 that by April 15th (1 week from declaring state of emergency), human mobility behavior have decreased by around 50% both in terms of radius of gyration and total travel distance per user, and also that social contacts in Tokyo had been reduced by more than 70% both in terms of daily total contacts and daily peak time contacts following non-compulsory measures including remote working requests to businesses and closures of public schools. The analysis results also showed that mobility reduction had already taken place before late March (around 40% decrease of social contacts), when the number of imported cases of COVID-19 started to increase. This indicates that even before the actual spread of COVID-19 in Japan, and even under only non-compulsory measures, a significant amount of cooperation was provided by the Japanese citizens to contain the spread of COVID-19. By comparing the mobility analysis results with the effective reproduction number R(t) estimated by the government panel, we were further able to show strong correlation between the mobility reduction and decrease in transmissibility of COVID-19. During late March, R(t) rose above 1 and the number of patients increased, however, the nation-wide state of emergency triggered further reduction in mobility, resulting in R(t) to drop below 1. In fact, it was found that reduction of mobility and social contacts beyond certain thresholds (e.g. social contact index of 0.42) had little incremental effects on the decrease in R(t), indicating excessive decrease in human activities during the state of emergency. Looking forward into lifting the state of emergency declaration, these results could inform decision making on how much human mobility and social contact reduction is needed to keep the transmissibility of COVID-19 below 1. Figure 4G provides more directly observable measures of mobility reduction at various place of interests which can be used to interpret the sufficient amount of social contact reduction to contain COVID-19.",

First, the presented analysis was limited to understanding the correlations between mobility and contact reduction and transmissibility. However, microscopic human behavior, such as sanitizing hands more often or higher rates of wearing face masks, could have affected the reduction in transmissibility. Because of such factors other than human mobility, the relationships between mobility reductions and transmissibility could change after lifting the state of emergency. Due to the lack of data on R(t) under no interventions, it is not certain whether the R(t) values reach a similar value of that in European countries and the US. Additional household surveys and interviews need to be conducted to quantify the effects of such behavioral changes. Second, the estimated effective reproduction number in the entire Japan was used in this study as the only metric to describe COVID-19 transmissibility. Further analysis using the effective reproduction number estimated for Tokyo, or other metrics that reflect the spread of COVID-19 in Tokyo such as genetic analysis results, could generate more robust conclusions on the relationships between mobility reduction and COVID-19 transmissibility. Third, GPS location data collected from mobile phones are prone to spatial errors up to 100 meters. This spatial error could have biased the results of the mobility reduction, including the radius of gyration, total travel distance, and stay at home rates. However, sensitivity analysis shows that the conclusions are not affected by the spatial thresholds selected in this study. In addition to the 2% sample rate, the granularity of the data was not adequate to compute the actual contacts between individuals (i.e. 2 meters distance for all individuals). Moreover, is it known that mobile phone data contain biases in age groups. It is important to analyze the mobility of the elderly population due to the high mortality rate of COVID-19. Although similar conclusions were reached when different spatial thresholds were used via sensitivity analysis, additional validation using small scale but precise data could further clarify the approximate social contact measure computed in this study using mobile phone data.",

In addition to the spatial dimension, extending the time period of analysis after April 15th could strengthen our understanding between social contact decrease and transmissibility reduction.
