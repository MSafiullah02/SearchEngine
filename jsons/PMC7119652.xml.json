A possible explanation for these results is the difference in concentration of total RNA in each diluent, which would theoretically be zero in DEPC water and higher in bovine fetal serum and feces suspension. Besides, greater amounts of total RNA improve pellet formation during precipitation with propanol in the extraction protocol (Sambrook and Russel, 2001, St\u00e5hlberg et al., 2004).",
