The impact was compounded for teaching physicians and vascular trainees.3\n,\n4 The rotations many of 3rd and 4th year medical students were suspended, often due to the shortage of medical supplies. New quarantine polices limited surgeries to urgent or emergent cases.5 Students could perform other medically related tasks such as triage or patient assessments to free up clinician time, or possibly assist in some administrative tasks. Final semester students could help create surge capacity.6 Education conferences have been conducted virtually at the institution and regional levels.",

They can also perform many bed side procedures for critically ill patients such as placement of central lines and temporary vascular access. The Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) recently published new regulations for vascular trainees, which includes accepting 44 weeks of clinical time including any non-voluntary time for 2019-2020 academic year without preapproval, and a 10% decrease of total reported cases. Non-voluntary time off used for clinical or education purpose can be counted as clinical time. Trainees are learning about \u201ccheck-ins\u201d and \u201cE-visits\u201d with the newly introduced HCPCS codes G2010, G2012), and about remote patient monitoring services such as a patient\u2019s oxygen saturation levels using pulse oximetry (CPT codes 99091, 99457-99458, 99473- 99474, 99493-99494). Medicare physician supervision no longer requires direct physician supervision for outpatient or critical cases. However, team segregation policies to limit the chance of inter circle cross contamination is extremely important as well as complying with the new Medicare telehealth update.
