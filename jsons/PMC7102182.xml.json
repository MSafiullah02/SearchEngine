The types of infiltrating cells are not predefined, so this can be inflammatory as well as tumor cells. Tumorous infiltration will be excluded, since there are too many entities, not only carcinomas but also lymphomas and certain sarcomas such as angiosarcomas. Therefore, our main focus will be on interstitial pneumonias (IP).",

Characteristically, lesions are found in both lower lobes with a predominance of subpleural regions. The involvement of both lobes is most often symmetrical. By HRCT, different features can be seen: fibrotic and scar lesions, ground glass areas, and honeycombing. Cystic lesions, consolidations, and scars are found on gross cut surface. The pleura usually show multiple retractions, giving the surface a cobblestone appearance, but pleuritis is not seen. The histological hallmarks are fibroblastic foci, scars and diffuse fibrosis, honeycomb areas, and uninvolved areas in between (Figs. 2 and 27; Suppl. Fig. 28).\n",

            "text": "The cause and the etiology of IPF/UIP are not well understood. There is a working hypothesis, which can explain some of the features. The disease starts with an as yet unidentified epithelial injury causing apoptosis of pneumocytes [11\u201314]. Inflammatory signals released by the dying pneumocytes cause transformation and proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a myxoid stroma and repair [15] (so-called fibroblastic focus). Genetic abnormalities may underlie these apoptotic responses: In the recent years, research in familial forms of IPF has highlighted the importance of surfactant apoproteins in maintaining homeostasis between injury and repair and that mutations in the surfactant apoprotein C gene might be causally related to the development of familial IPF [16]. In these familial IPF, mutations in genes encoding surfactant apoprotein C and A2 increases endoplasmic stress reactions in pneumocytes type II, and in addition, mutations in the telomerase genes TERT and TERC are responsible for telomere shortening, probably decreasing the pool of peripheral lung stem cells and thus impairing repair and regeneration [17]. This later defects are also found in sporadic IPF cases. Therefore, inhalation of any kind of toxic material from the environment might cause an overwhelming oxygen stress reaction leading to increased apoptosis of pneumocytes and impaired regeneration [18]. This fits quite well into the epidemiology of IPF patients: The majority are smokers, and some have a history of environmental dust exposure [19, 20]. There is also evidence of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pneumocytes into myofibroblasts (Fig. 3), and also scattered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells seem to move into these foci [21\u201323]. These foci undergo maturation with collagen deposition, and finally, the process results in fibrosis of alveolar septa and bronchiolar walls [13]. This in turn causes obstruction of the terminal airways resulting in cystic destruction of the remaining peripheral lobules, giving rise to honeycombing and remodeling of the lung parenchyma [14, 24, 25]. The process develops stepwise, which means there are lung lobules not affected yet looking normal, whereas others are destroyed or even completely lost to fibrosis and scarring. This is meant by the term \u201ctimely heterogeneity.\u201d In the author\u2019s experience, a diagnosis of UIP/IPF can be established in some cases even without clinical information when the following features are given: fibroblastic foci, timely heterogeneity (involved and uninvolved peripheral lobules), cystic and fibrotic destruction resulting in honeycombing, and most importantly, the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in areas of fibroblastic foci, absence of granulomas, or features of other interstitial inflammation.\n",

Given the differences in resolution between HRCT and histology, there is a substantial difference in size between the two. Pathologically, a so-called honeycomb lesion is a cystic lung lesion involving a secondary lobule. This lobule has lost most of the peripheral alveoli, shows a cystic central area composed of bronchioles and centroacinar structures, covered by a cuboidal and cylindrical epithelium, resembling bronchiolar epithelium and transformed pneumocytes type II (Figs. 2b and 4). In some cases, a pseudostratified squamous-looking epithelium can be present. The cyst walls are fibrotic and often merge with scarred lung tissue or large fibrotic areas involving sometimes a subsegment of the lung. Within the lumen, mucus can accumulate, and in late stage, this can be the starting point for secondary infection and bronchopneumonia, causing death of the patient. I prefer the term lobular cystic lung remodeling, instead of honeycombing, because of the size differences between HRCT and microscopy (Suppl. Fig. 28).\n",

If lymphocytes appear in numbers (>10/HPF) within a fibroblast focus, this should raise the possibility of an underlying immune reaction.

There is no timely heterogeneity, meaning that the lesions seem to have appeared at the same time. Hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is usually not present [28, 29]. The lung architecture is preserved in contrast to UIP, and cystic destruction is absent. Two forms are discerned, which in some cases might represent timely sequences of the disease: the cellular and fibrotic types (Figs. 5 and 6). Both behave differently; the cellular type has a better prognosis, whereas the fibrotic variant is more close to UIP [6]. In the etiologic background, NSIP is most often associated with autoimmune diseases, especially with CVD [30\u201334]. An association with drug-induced pneumonia and also with allergic diseases such as EAA/HP has also been reported [35, 36]. Only those cases without an identifiable etiology are labeled as idiopathic NSIP. However, the morphologic pattern is identical; therefore, in most instances, idiopathic NSIP remains a clinical diagnosis. Clinically, NSIP shows diffuse infiltrations, corresponding to ground glass opacities on HRCT. Symptoms as in the other ILD are quite unspecific. Many patients with NSIP will respond to corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drug treatment, and also spontaneous resolution of the disease has been reported [37, 38].\n\n",

On HRCT, OP/COP shows a pattern with combinations of ground glass opacities and consolidations and the almost diagnostic tree-in-bud pattern, sometimes also reticulonodular pattern [39]. In rare cases, the consolidation can mimic a tumor [40]. Histologically, the hallmark of OP is an intra-alveolar granulation tissue, the so-called Masson body (Figs. 7 and 27). It consists of proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and macrophages. Few hemosiderin-laden macrophages are often present. The granulation tissue can start from the wall of bronchi, bronchioli, and alveoli. There is usually a defect of the epithelial layer and also the basal lamina. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts grow into the defect; however, in contrast to normal repair, the granulation tissue does not stop but continuously grows into the airspaces, filling these completely or incompletely. In later stages, pneumocytes will grow over these granulation tissue plugs and, therefore, a slit-like airspace can be formed (Fig. 8) [40]. The amount of inflammatory cells within the granulation tissue depends on the cause of OP. The morphologic pattern of OP has a very wide range of etiologies. It can occur as a post-infectious process, in inactive or resolving stages of autoimmune disease/CVD and vasculitis, in toxin inhalation, in drug-induced lung diseases, in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, or idiopathic, which is COP [41\u201344]. In some cases of OP, the etiologic cause can be determined, for example, by viral inclusion bodies in post-viral OP (Fig. 9) or by endothelial cell reactions in drug-induced OP. In some cases, an additional pathologic tissue reaction besides OP can also point to the underlying etiology.\n\n\n",

Depending on the cause of DAD, neutrophilic and/or eosinophilic granulocytes can be found in bacterial, toxic, or drug-induced DAD or scattered lymphocytes are seen in viral and rickettsial infections [45, 46] (Fig. 9). Inflammatory infiltrates may be even absent such as in various kinds of shock. Rarely, cases of \u201cidiopathic AIP\u201d have been reported. Probably, some of these cases represent cases of undiagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or drug toxicity. In the author\u2019s experience, in all cases sent for consultation and primarily labeled as idiopathic DAD, an etiology could finally be established. So it might be questioned, if idiopathic DAD does exist. Hamman and Rich described an IP with fulminant course, leading to death in their six cases within 6 months. In the authors\u2019 description, there was no hyaline membrane mentioned, but a proliferation of fibroblasts.

Serum proteins will pass into the alveolar lumina, coagulate there, and by the breathing movements are compressed into hyaline membranes. In case of airborne disease, e.g., infection or inhaled toxins, pneumocytes type I die followed by type II. The basement membrane is either preserved or destroyed (especially in viral infection).

In some cases, the progression of the disease might be blocked by antiprotease treatment [48]. In more recent time, extracorporeal oxygenation or nitric oxide treatment has shown some benefit. If the patient survives the acute phase, DAD will be organized, which is essentially an OP-type of lesion, but is most often labeled as organizing DAD: Granulation tissue grows into the alveoli and hyaline membranes are incorporated into the plugs. They can be demonstrated several weeks after the initial injury. If a tissue biopsy or an autopsy specimen is available early on in the course of the disease, the etiology might be elucidated. In viral infection, inclusion bodies can be seen, later followed by atypical proliferation and transformation of pneumocytes type II. In contrast to atypical pneumocyte hyperplasia (AAH), these atypical cells are single, do not form a continuous layer along the alveolar wall, and usually show bizarre nuclei and nucleoli. Rickettsial infection results in less pronounced proliferation of pneumocytes. In shock- and drug-induced DAD, the endothelia will undergo apoptosis and necrosis, and fibrin cloths might be seen in capillaries. In these cases, the alveolar septa are widened and edematous.

The infiltration in LIP is more diffuse, architectural distortion is common, and scarring does occur. Histiocytic and monocytic cellular infiltrations are much less pronounced compared to NSIP. Lymphoepithelial lesions do occur similar to lymphomas, in some entities aggressively infiltrating and destroying the epithelium and in other cases no epithelial disruption does occur.

Most often, NSIP is associated with this disease [34, 53], but these reported studies have in common a selection bias: they looked up the incidence of rhA in cases presenting with NSIP. The diversity of reaction patterns is much better reflected in studies looking up patients with rhA and lung involvement [54]. UIP was more common in this study. In our own experience (Stacher et al., submitted), most often, a mixture of reaction patterns occurred, such as UIP combined with dense lymphocytic infiltrates or LIP and UIP combined with OP or NSIP. If features of DAD occur, one should discuss drug reactions with the clinicians because many immunosuppressive drugs given in rhA and other CVD can cause DAD [45, 46, 55, 56]. Not uncommonly, granulomas are present too. These are most often foreign body-type granulomas with giant cells, sometimes classical rheumatoid granulomas with palisading histiocytes, and rarely epitheloid cell granulomas [55]. In classical rheumatoid granulomas, it is essential to exclude infectious organisms, since patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs like methotrexate and leflunomide are prone to acquire infections [56\u201358] (Figs. 12 and 13).

In case of massive neutrophilic cell death, there might be massive leakage of vessel walls and hemorrhage will occur. In later stages, DAD will be organized, so OP is another feature found in systemic lupus. Since the disease affects the coagulation cascade, lung infarction is a common feature of SLE.

Germinal centers are less common compared to Sj\u00f8gren\u2019s syndrome. Ill-formed granulomas composed of histiocytic and/or epitheloid cells can be seen (Fig. 14). The distribution pattern of the IP is irregular, involving peripheral as well as midzone areas of the lung. This is clinically helpful in separating it from UIP/IPF. Another feature helpful in the diagnosis is a vasculopathy. Medium- and small-sized arteries show a thickening of the intima and media. Within the thickened vessel wall, there is a myxoid change of the matrix. A few lymphocytes can be seen, however, no endothelial necrosis or any other sign of vasculitis. These changes can possibly be best interpreted as a consequence of immune complex deposition (Fig. 15). Functionally, these vascular changes will cause pulmonary hypertension, which is common in SSc [70, 71].\n\n",

Also, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) received attention as essential factors in the pathogenesis of SSc. CTGF mRNA expression was observed in the fibrotic lesions, serum CTGF concentrations were significantly elevated, and correlated with skin sclerosis and lung fibrosis. In an animal model, TGF-\u03b2 induced subcutaneous fibrosis and subsequent CTGF application caused persistent fibrosis. Based on these data, the authors of this study hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 induces fibrosis in the early stage, whereas CTGF acts to maintain tissue fibrosis [73]. In another study, fibrillin has been investigated. It has been demonstrated that caveolin-1 and fibrillin-1 influence storage and regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and other cytokines and fibrillin-1 mutations might be responsible for a congenital form of scleroderma called stiff skin syndrome [74, 75]. In addition to tissue-resident fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived fibroblasts and endothelial and epithelial cells undergoing EMT are also under the control of fibrillin. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function abnormalities of these mediators may account for the characteristic activated phenotype of SSc fibroblasts [75]. The impaired expression of the nuclear orphan receptor PPAR-\u03b3 in SSc seems to play an important role in causing uncontrolled progression of fibrosis through impaired control of fibroblast activation and differentiation [76].",

IL-12 overexpressing transgenic mice developed bronchial and alveolar abnormalities such as lymphocytic infiltrates around the bronchi, cell proliferation in the alveolar septa, and increased interstitial and alveolar macrophages, strikingly similar to those found in the lungs of Sj\u00f8gren\u2019s patients. There were also fourfold higher numbers of natural killer cells. A new mouse model highlights the role of IL-12 in the initiation of Sj\u00f8gren\u2019s syndrome [77]. Rangel-Moreno studied the hyperplasia of BALT in patients with pulmonary involvement in rhA and Sj\u00f8gren\u2019s syndrome. Increased expression of CXCL13 and CCL21, as well as B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), ICOS ligand, and lymphotoxin, correlated with BALT hyperplasia. The presence of BALT hyperplasia correlated also with tissue damage in the lungs of these patients [78]. In a recent investigation, genes related to one of the major symptoms of Sj\u00f8gren\u2019s syndrome have been identified, namely, the immunological attack of salivary and lacrimal glands resulting in the loss of acinar cell tissue and function, leading to stomatitis sicca and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. One gene lying on chromosome 1 (autoimmune exocrinopathy 2 [Aec2]) and the second on chromosome 3 (autoimmune exocrinopathy 1 [Aec1]) have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to replicate SjS-like disease in C57BL/6 mice. Aec2 lies distal to the centromere. This chromosomal region contains several sets of genes known to correlate with various immunopathological features of SjS. One gene in particular, tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily member 4 (or Ox40 ligand), encoding a product whose biological functions correlate with both physiological homeostasis and immune regulations, could be a potential candidate SjS susceptibility gene [79]. Although many open questions remain, this mouse model opens the way to better understand this autoimmune disease and also will serve to study the mechanisms, which are responsible for the common development into MALT lymphomas.",

It has been postulated that tobacco plant antigens still present within tobacco smoke (incomplete combustion) might cause this accumulation and proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are part of the antigen-presenting reticulum cell population [89\u201391]. So the continuous exposure of Langerhans cells to plant proteins in susceptible persons might cause proliferation of these cells to keep with the increasing amount of antigens. Langerhans cells proliferate within bronchial mucosa as well as in the peripheral lung. In bronchi, this proliferation causes necrosis of the mucosa, occlusion of the lumen, and finally, scar tissue [92] (Fig. 18; Suppl. Fig. 34). Langerhans cell proliferation is accompanied by an infiltration of eosinophils, hence the old name eosinophilic granuloma. These eosinophils are attracted by cytokines such as interleukin 4 secreted by the Langerhans cells [93]. Eosinophilic granulocytes might also act cytotoxic in cooperation with Langerhans cells releasing eosinophilic basic proteins and destroy the epithelium. The granulomas undergo regression especially in patients with smoking cessation. The resulting scar has a star-like appearance and is surrounded by bronchiolectasis and emphysema blebs. On CT scan, this results in a characteristic picture (starry sky). An underlying genetic abnormality has recently been identified [94\u201396]. Mutations in the BRAF oncogene has resulted that LHCH is now regarded as a tumor. However, several issues remain to be solved before this view can be accepted: Lung cases are most often induced by smoking and, in many patients, will undergo regression in case of smoking cessation, which is unlikely in a tumor [91]. BRAF mutations were not found in all cases. On the other hand, there exists a tumorous form, characterized by a multiorgan involvement, seen in children and young adults and not related to smoking. So probably, we might be confronted with two different diseases. So far, the reactive form cannot be discerned from the tumor form other than by involvement of at least two organ systems [97, 98]. Further investigations hopefully will increase our knowledge about this disease. In the differential diagnosis, LHCH has to be separated from other histiocytosis or reticulum cell proliferations by their positive staining for CD1a and langerin [99, 100], whereas the positivity for S100 protein is not specific.\n",

RB can also be seen combined with LHCH [101]. An accumulation of alveolar macrophages within the respiratory bronchioles and the adjacent centrilobular region of the lung lobules characterize RBILD. The macrophages usually contain dirty brownish-yellow fine granular pigment (Fig. 19). Ultrastructurally, this pigment represents phagolysosomes filled with tobacco waste [102\u2013104]. Functionally, this macrophage accumulation obstructs the terminal bronchioles and impairs airflow, resulting in distension of alveoli and eventually rupture of septa. Some authors use the diagnosis of RB only in those cases, where no other pathology is present, others this author included follow the morphology and accept RB diagnosis also in heavy smokers with lung carcinoma in whom RB is also present. The argument is that RB is a disease of smokers, and there is no good argument why smokers are not allowed to have more than one disease, e.g., RB, carcinoma, LHCH. However, this results in different statistical figures: If RB diagnosis is only accepted presenting as a singular disease, it is rare; if diagnosed by its morphological features regardless of other smoking induced diseases, it is a common disease, present in many patients with lung cancer. RB and RBILD in my opinion are subsequent stages of the same disease. In the early stages, accumulation of alveolar macrophages is concentrated within bronchioles. If tobacco smoke exposure goes on, more and more areas of the centroacinar region of alveoli are occupied by these cells, resulting in radiological ground glass opacities, now clinically called RBILD.\n",

By definition, DIP is characterized by an accumulation of pigmented smoker macrophages within alveoli, completely obscuring the peripheral airspaces. No infiltration of bronchioles is present (Suppl.

In some areas, the disease resembles fibrotic NSIP, but the typical association with tobacco smoking points to this underlying etiology. In looking up several cases of RB, we also recognized similar reactions as described by S. Yousem and A.L. Katzenstein, but in addition, also cases showing fibroblastic foci associated with emphysema blebs and fibrosis (Fig. 20). In these cases, also RB could be seen in different areas. In contrast to UIP, there were no honeycomb lesions and almost all lobules showed changes of centrilobular emphysema. Some of these patients were clinically diagnosed as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in others, the lesions were found incidentally because of pneumothorax. So this might represent another form of smoking-induced lung fibrosis, probably resulting from the release of toxic enzymes from macrophages and subsequent alveolar septa destruction and repair.\n",

TSC1 coding for hamartin and TSC2 coding for tuberin are both required for controlling the expression and regulation of mTOR and the mTOR complexes TORC1/2. Both proteins form a complex, which activates cAMP kinase, which subsequently inactivates mTOR. In LAM, TSC2 is more often mutated then TSC1 [129\u2013132]. Tuberin is thus not functional and does not form heterodimers with hamartin, and TORC1/2 is constantly activated. TSC mutation can be a germline mutation as in tuberous sclerosis syndrome or mutated somatically, called by some authors as \u201cform fruste\u201d [133]. The second allele is most often mutated somatically. The type of mutation also dictates the extent of syndromes and tumors associated with this mutation. Patients carrying the germline mutation present with genetic instability causing several somatic mutations and, therefore, in addition to LAM, can present with different other benign tumors. Previously, lung transplantation was one of the few choices of treatment; since the discovery of the function of both TSC proteins, a clinical trial with anti-mTOR therapy has been started and seems to be effective [134\u2013136]. Interestingly, in rare cases, with lung transplantation, a recurrence of the disease occurred from circulating LAM cells, repopulating the transplanted lungs [137\u2013141].",

In addition, perivascular epitheloid cells (PEC) also proliferate (probably derived from pericytic stem cells). The proportion of myoblasts and PEC can vary considerably: In some cases of LAM, PEC are numerous, in other cases scarce. The cells together form microscopic nodules in the bronchiolar mucosa, along lymphatics and arteries, and in alveolar septa, causing lymphatic obstruction and rupture (chylothorax) and also bronchial obstruction and cystic lung destruction. These myoblasts show immature myofilaments, are not ordered in parallel as normal smooth muscle cells, and also have a more epitheloid appearance. Nuclei are round and larger than in regular smooth muscle cells. Most importantly, these cells proliferate in locations where no muscle cell proliferation occurs (Suppl. Fig. 40). By immunohistochemistry, the myoblasts express smooth muscle actin, and a few also desmin, whereas the PEC express HMB45 [133, 142].",

This can affect the ability to form melanosomes (resulting in albinism), platelet granules (inducing bleeding diathesis), and also phagolysosomes in macrophages and lamellar bodies in type II pneumocytes [143]. To date, seven forms are known, but only two of them (types I and IV) constantly affect the lung, causing phagocytosis defects with accumulation of macrophages, lamellar body defects in type II pneumocytes with disturbed surfactant release and macrophage foam cell changes, inflammation, and finally, lung fibrosis [144\u2013147]. The characteristic morphologic changes are hyperplasia of pneumocytes type II, giant lamellar bodies (large PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules), accumulation of foamy macrophages within the alveoli, lymphocytic interstitial infiltration and lung fibrosis, sometimes as OP with intra-alveolar granulation tissue, and also as interstitial fibrosis with myofibroblastic foci, identical to those in UIP (Fig. 22; Suppl. Fig. 41). Even both types of fibrosis OP and UIP can be present concomitantly in one patient. In contrast to UIP/IPF, honeycomb lesions are scarce, and usually, the lung is diffusely involved, leaving not much uninvolved tissue in between (no timely heterogeneity). In contrast to UIP/IPF, the involvement of the lung is not symmetric, fibrosis can occur peripherally as well as centrally, and is always patchy. Ultrastructurally, there are no well-formed lamellar bodies within pneumocytes type II. Within macrophages, lysosomes are enlarged and irregularly contoured, while phagolysosomes are absent (no fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes).\n",

In rare instances, there are diffuse dense infiltrations by histiocytes accompanied by lymphocytes and plasma cells. These histiocytes are negative for Langerhans cell markers (CD1a, langerin) and markers for follicular and interdigitating dendritic cells (CD35, CD83), but can be positive for S100 protein (much less intensive staining compare to interdigitating dendritic cells) and are usually positive for CD68, CD163, and lysozyme (Suppl.

It is characterized by an accumulation of macrophages within bronchioles and a lymphocytic infiltration within the bronchiolar walls. Hyperplasia of BALT does occur and follicle centers might be present, usually related to recurrent infections [151]. In contrast to LIP, the infiltration is always concentrated along bronchi and bronchioles. DPB might be difficult to separate from other forms of bronchiolitis. However, there are some features which are of help: In DPB, the obstructive lesions are confined to the respiratory bronchioli; chronic parasinusitis is common; follicular bronchiolitis is a common finding [152] (Fig. 23). The cause is a phenotypic variation in the HLA system involving HLA-B54, HLA-A11, and HLA-DRB5*010/020 [153], which leads to susceptibility to otherwise nonpathogenic bacterial infection in immunocompetent children. Children with this HLA type need to be treated with erythromycin every time a respiratory tract infection occurs. In nontreated children, the disease will cause secondary destruction of the peripheral lung with cyst formation and fibrosis. Initially, DPB was mainly identified in children of Asian descent; however, this disease has also been diagnosed in Caucasians [154]. But it should be mentioned that the diagnosis should be confirmed by morphologic analysis because of similarity with other forms of bronchiolitis, seen by HRCT [103, 155].\n",

Normally, four proteins are folded into a complex with the help of chaperones. Many different forms of amyloid proteins have been identified. Misfolding can occur in several different compositions of amyloid [158]. Most common are amyloid A and P; however, microglobulin 2\u03b2, transthyretin, and others can also be seen in pulmonary amyloidosis. The reason for amyloid deposition can be a tumor; one of the best-known examples is plasmocytoma. In this case, amyloid is formed out of immunoglobulins secreted by the tumor cells. Chronic inflammation such as CVD can also cause amyloid deposition [159, 160]. Amyloid deposition can occur as a tumor-like deposit, either along the bronchial tree or within the lung periphery (nodular form), or it can be diffuse perivascular and interstitial (Suppl. Fig. 43). Amyloid stains red by eosin stain, orange by the Congo red stain, or can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies for the different components [161]. If a Congo red stain is applied, the tissue section should be examined under polarized light, where the stain exhibits a green birefringence. Amyloid deposits very often will cause a tissue reaction with foreign body giant cells forming granulomas, and also calcification and metaplastic bone formation can occur. The major differential diagnosis to amyloidosis is IgG4-mediated fibrosis and hyalinosis; however, the dense lymphoplasmocytic infiltrations will lead to the correct diagnosis.",

Following the deposition of metal dust the disease starts with respiratory bronchiolitis; giant cells loaded with compound from this alloy are formed early on. The macrophage accumulation spreads further to the periphery, and finally macrophages and giant cells can be found in alveoli, septa, and peribronchiolar. Also DAD can be seen in some cases. The disease can present with acute illness, shortness of breath, and severe hypoxia.

A common presentation is DAD as an acute reaction, often followed by organizing DAD, where hyaline membranes can still be recognized, and finally, ending as OP and lung fibrosis. Other drugs induce NSIP-like tissue reactions. The major problem in interpreting drug reaction in the lung is our limited understanding of drug metabolism. Some drugs will induce toxic injury of endothelial cells, thus the blood barrier is leaking, and proteins can enter the interstitium and finally the alveolar lumen. Here, these proteins will form complexes and, by the action of respiration, hyaline membranes will form. In addition, the exudate from the capillaries will cause a transient edema and this is followed by hypoxia affecting the pneumocytes. This damage will contribute to DAD development. Later on, OP can result. Other drugs act on the immune system, forming immune complexes either because immunogenic by itself or by complexing with endogenous proteins like a hapten. In these cases, an NSIP or LIP pattern can result. In these cases, scattered eosinophils are regularly found. Granulomas are rarely formed, usually pointing to an underlying immune mechanism. Since our understanding is so limited and no systematic experimental investigation has been performed, we still need to rely on databases, summarizing all described drug reactions in a systematic way (www.pneumotox.com) (Fig. 27 and Suppl.
