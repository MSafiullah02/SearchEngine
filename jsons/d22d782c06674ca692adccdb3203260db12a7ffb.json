On March 25, 2020, a total of 375,498 cases had been confirmed globally with 2,201 cases in Brazil, showing the urgency of reacting to this international public health emergency. While in most cases, mild symptoms are observed, in some cases the infection leads to serious pulmonary disease. As a result, the possible consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for pregnant women and its potential effects on the management of assisted reproductive treatments, demand attention. In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments. Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks. However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles. New evidence must be considered carefully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments.",

On March 5 2020, an issue of Euro Surveillance Journal reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe (Spiteri et al., 2020) , according to the WHO case definition (WHO, 2020b) . On March 15 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom with a total of 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,775 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020) . The Brazilian Health Ministry confirmed the first COVID-19 case on February 26 2020 in S\u00e3o Paulo. The patient was a 65-year-old man who had recently returned from northern Italy, where a significant outbreak had occurred. This was also the first confirmed case in South America, a continent with a population of over 640 million people who have previously experienced significant outbreaks of infections such as zika, dengue, and measles. The number of COVID-19 cases has been increasing constantly since the first reported case, and while initial cases were associated with travelers arriving from countries with ongoing COVID-19 epidemics, since March 13 2020, the stage of 'community transmission' was announced to be reached in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. At the time this manuscript was drafted (March 25 2020), 2,201 cases have been confirmed in Brazil, and the pandemic continues to increase worldwide, with currently 375,498 confirmed cases and 16,362 deaths in 195 countries (WHO, 2020c) .",

These steps helped control local outbreaks, and Chinese authorities reported absence of community transmission cases in China as of March 19 2020. Following this strategy, numerous countries also adopted social isolation regulations to contain the pandemic (WHO, 2020b). However, it is important to emphasize that transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is high and infection growth rates are exponential, ranging from 2.2 to 3.6 . The rapid increase in suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 suggests that virus transmission may occur by droplet infection and a fecal-oral route. Moreover, transmission from people with mild or no symptoms or before symptom onset may reduce the effect of such isolation strategies (Khan et al., 2020; Niud & Xu, 2020; Rothe et al., 2020) .",

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on type-I and type-II alveolar epithelial cells, is the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and infection causes respiratory symptoms and eventually the acute respiratory syndrome. This receptor is also expressed in the gut, albeit at a low abundance, and infection may lead to diarrhea and vomiting, despite it is less frequent. The S protein is required for the virus to fuse with the host cell through the receptor-binding domain. This protein includes two subunits, S1 and S2, and while S1 determines cellular tropism, S2 mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. After membrane fusion, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, and viral replication is initiated. Newly formed viral particle buds then fuse with the plasma membrane through virion-containing vesicles to release the virus Sun et al., 2020) . It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV also uses ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry; however, receptor binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, and the number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded that of SARS infections during the outbreak in China in 2002/2003, indicating higher transmission rates. Moreover, men typically have higher ACE2 levels than women, and Asians show higher levels of ACE2 expression in alveolar cells than Caucasian and African American people, which would suggest Asian males to be most susceptible to infection .",

The overall case fatality rate was 2.3%, but it was 8.0% in patients aged 70-79 years and 14.8% in patients aged 80 years and older; no deaths occurred in patients aged 9 years or younger and among mild and severe cases. However, case fatality rates were higher in patients with preexisting comorbid conditions, varying from 5.6% to 10.5%, depending on comorbidity (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . SARS and MERS infections, which also showed widespread transmission, produced fatality rates of 9.6% and 35%, respectively . Despite considerably higher case-fatality rates in SARS and MERS patients, COVID-19 seems to be more transmissible and has led to a higher number of deaths due to the large number of cases. In addition, the true number of COVID-19 cases can be presumed to be higher than the number of reported cases owing to inherent difficulties in identifying mild and asymptomatic cases in addition to insufficient COVID-19 testing capacities in all affected countries (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) .",

Hormone levels and immune competence show considerable variation throughout pregnancy. Early pregnancy seems to be more risk-prone due to adaptive changes in response to fetal antigens, but conditions typically stabilize with gradual adjustment of the mother's immune and endocrine systems, with highest stability in the late stages of pregnancy. Early pregnancy is a crucial period of fetal organ development, and the immune system is particularly sensitive at this stage, which likely affects the course of infections (Wong et al., 2004) . Experience with previous respiratory virus epidemics may offer some insights regarding COVID-19 susceptibility and complication rates during pregnancy. Swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus is an influenza virus type A, which also causes respiratory disease that can develop into an acute respiratory syndrome. During the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, pregnant women were found to be at higher risk of complications as they were four times more likely to be hospitalized than the rest of the population (Jamieson et al., 2009) . Regarding other coronaviruses, the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 produced 8,442 cases and 916 deaths, and studies have shown that clinical outcomes during this epidemic were worse in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. In addition, increasing rates of premature births and abortions have been associated with SARS-CoV infections (Schwartz and Graham, 2020) . Approximately 50% of pregnant women suffering from SARS required intensive care, and approximately 33% needed mechanical ventilation. The death rate of pregnant women suffering from SARS reached 25% (Wong et al., 2004) . From the MERS epidemic which produced 2,500 confirmed cases and caused 858 deaths, we can affirm that MERS progresses much more quickly to respiratory failure and results in higher mortality rates than SARS. However, there was no evidence of vertical transmission of MERS or SARS. Based on this evidence, there is no doubt that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, as even the H1N1, are associated with higher rates of complications in pregnant women (Schwartz and Graham, 2020) .",

Reprod. | v.24 | n\u00ba2 | Apr-May-Jun/ 2020 acteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, and no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy has been produced so far. Nine studies reported COVID-19 in pregnant women, with a total of 69 patients; however, some of these patients may have been included in more than one study (Table 1 ). The reported cases included five patients in the second trimester of pregnancy, and all other patients were in the third trimester. Most women showed mild or moderate symptoms, and three of them required intensive care. Preterm birth occurred in 8 out of 61 women who gave birth (Chen et al., 2020b; Chen et al., 2020c; Fan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2020a; Wen et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . A joint investigation carried out by the WHO and China evaluated 147 pregnant women in China (64 confirmed and 82 suspected COVID-19 cases and an asymptomatic patient), 8% showed severe symptoms, and 1% showed a critical course of disease. It was concluded that pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms (WHO, 2020d). Most likely, there are many other pregnant women with no or mild symptoms who were not included in these statistics. One case of a neonate infected with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed 36 hours after birth; however, it is unclear whether this was due to vertical transmission from mother to child (Wang et al., 2020b) .",

On March 17 2020, the ASRM published a new document named \"Patient Management and Clinical Recommendations During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\" in which the key recommendations were: 1. Suspend initiation of new treatment cycles, including ovulation induction, intrauterine inseminations (IUIs), in vitro fertilization (IVF) including retrievals and frozen embryo transfers, as well as non-urgent gamete cryopreservation. 2. Strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers whether fresh or frozen. 3. Continue to care for patients who are currently \"in-cycle\" or who require urgent stimulation and cryopreservation. 4. Suspend elective surgeries and non-urgent diagnostic procedures. 5. Minimize in-person interactions and increase utilization of telehealth (ASRM, 2020b).",

The SBRA and the REDLARA published a joint note on March 17 2020, firstly suggesting that infertility treatments should continue as planned to avoid reducing prospects of success in infertile women but that the advice of international societies to postpone embryo transfers should be followed (SBRA & REDLARA, 2020) . Then, an update launched on March 20 2020 recommended that ongoing cycles should be finalized and new procedures should not be initiated. Embryo transfer must be assessed individually with strict controls on the patients and teams involved and the exceptions lies on oncological and others situations in which the postponement may cause loss to the patient, since the decision need to be shared (SBRA & REDLARA, 2020) .",

Hence, most of Human Reproduction Societies are restrictive suggesting to postpone embryo transfer independently of confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19 and suspend all cycle's initiations, with rare exceptions. However, whilst every effort must be made to reduce services over coming weeks or maybe months, it is necessary to think forwards towards a resumption of services and a number of questions need to be answered around the management of ART: Should we cancel all ART cycles at this moment? Should we keep the treatments and postpone all embryo transfers? Should we keep only embryo transfers for couple whose success of treatment can be impaired or those who desire transfer the embryos?",

            "text": "Based on most recent epidemiologic data on COVID-19 and pregnancy, there is no evidence to suggest increased risk for mothers or fetuses. It appears that the course of disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women does not differ from that in other young adults. Moreover, recent evidence suggests no association of vertical transmission and malformations, and the management of pregnant patients should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal/fetal health status. It is important to consider that the current COVID-19 pandemic causes psychological stress and anxiety in pregnant women, which may exert adverse effects. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize the recommendations regarding social isolation and quarantine as issued by health authorities in order to avoid further spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, deciding between initiating/resuming or postponing assisted reproductive treatments depends more strongly on social isolation than on COVID-19 and its potential effects during pregnancy, bearing in mind potential emotional effects on patients.",
