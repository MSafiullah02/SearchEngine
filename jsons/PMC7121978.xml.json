Survival rates vary significantly by etiology and have improved to around 60% overall without LT and over 85% with LT [3]. Improvement of survival rates over recent decades is related to improved critical care management, better prognostic assessment, and the timely prioritization of patients for LT. The management of ALF is focused on support of all organ systems and the prevention and treatment of complications, particularly sepsis. Liver necrosis acts as a focus of inflammation, driving vasoplegia and leading to cardiovascular collapse, which exacerbates dysfunction of other vital organs, particularly the kidney and brain. The identification and treatment of the cause of the underlying liver injury should be the primary goal, with a concurrent focus on the optimization of the circulation to promote hepatocellular regeneration and to prevent further insult due to ischemic injury. However, despite such endeavors timely recognition that hepatic regeneration will ultimately not be sufficient is crucial. Under these circumstances, Liver transplantation with removal of the necrotic liver mass offers the best chance of survival. The decision to prioritize for transplantation requires a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating specialist liver transplant surgeons, hepatologists, and intensivists who can utilize established prognostic criteria along with the daily assessment of the levels of organ support to best determine which patients are likely to benefit from being listed for transplant with high priority and indeed proceeding to OLT if levels of organ support permit (Fig. 3.2) [4].\n",

Patients with ALF must fulfill a strict set of selection criteria based on published risk factors for prioritization before being listed on the national super-urgent transplantation waiting list (Table 3.1). These patients are then stratified by blood group and time while on the super-urgent waiting list. In most cases a donor organ should be available within 48\u201372 h. Occasionally an ABO incompatible donor organ needs to be considered in light of the unavailability of an ABO compatible organ weighed against the projected deterioration of the clinical condition. The currently available selection criteria are imperfect and when coupled with improving transplant free survival rates, particularly for acetominophen overdose [5], the decision of who and when to transplant is complex. There is emerging support for delaying transplant if the clinical situation is improving in patients with a favorable etiology [6]. The option of an auxiliary transplant graft is sometimes considered as it allows native regeneration and withdrawal of immunosuppression, but due to the increased risk of early postoperative complications it necessitates careful scrutiny of appropriate potential candidates.",

The two most common definitions concentrate on the time period from jaundice to the onset of encephalopathy [1]. This classification is important, because the hyperacute forms of ALF including acetominophen overdose and Hepatitis A are associated with mortality due to cerebral edema and kidney injury. However, survival without transplantation for this group is superior compared to more indolent subacute causes, including sero-negative and idiosyncratic drug reactions (Fig. 3.2) [4, 3]. These etiologies are not as frequently complicated by the cerebral and renal insults, but carry a higher mortality burden compared to hyperacute causes (Table 3.1) [2] (Fig. 1.3).\n",

In 1998 the Medicine Control Agency in the UK sought to limit the availability of paracetamol. Legislation was changed in line with World Health Organization recommendations and data from other countries with similar restrictive policies that had lower rates of paracetamol-induced hepatoxicity. Suicidal or para-suicidal actions are usually impulsive acts in reaction to crises; therefore, it was postulated that limiting supply would result in reduced availability of paracetamol, thus reducing the quantity ingested and lowering rates of hepatoxicity. The general sale of paracetamol was restricted to sixteen 500 mg tablets, a total of 8 g per packet. Reports suggested that this was a successful policy that resulted in a reduction of intensive care admissions and of deaths from POD by 43% in the years following the legislation [8], despite some debate on the true mortality benefit of pack size reduction alone [9].",

Due to a combination of the small doses absorbed and the efficacy of early antidote therapy, only 0.6% of these cases result in hepatoxicity in the UK. Studies assessing the rate of deliberate versus accidental POD display geographic variation. In Europe, studies have reported around 86% of POD cases were deliberate and 14% were accidental [11], while US poisons center data have reported rates of 35% and 65%, respectively [12]. Paracetamol medications combined with narcotics pose a potential for unintentional hepatoxicity when addiction to the narcotic within such combined analgesics leads to a gradual increase of the ingested dose [13]. This may be a significant reason for the discrepancy between the US and the UK with regard to deliberate and unintentional overdose. The assessment of the risk of developing ALF from POD, whether accidental or deliberate, is closely related to the total dose ingested, as well as the time from ingestion to presentation and treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) .",

The majority of non-paracetamol DILI cases are idiosyncratic reactions that occur in around 1 in 10,000 of exposed patients. More than 1000 drugs and herbal remedies have been implicated and idiosyncratic reactions comprise 10% of ALF cases [19].

The reactions are idiosyncratic as liver injury is unpredictable and not dose-dependant. There are non-allergic and allergic idiosyncratic DILI, the latter characterized by fever, skin reactions, eosinophilia with the formation of autoantibodies (for example drug-related eosinophilic syndrome\u2014DRESS). Several risk factors for DILI have been identified and include age, female gender, concomitant diseases, and specific drugs.

A literature review in 2005 cited 34 cases of primary and metastatic neoplastic infiltration of the liver resulting in ALF [21]. The pathophysiology of ALF in neoplastic infiltration is multifactorial. Parenchymal ischemia and infarction can be caused by diffuse tumor cell infiltration or vascular occlusion from tumor thrombi. It has also been postulated that diffuse tumor cell infiltration renders the remaining liver parenchyma highly susceptible to ischemic injury. A case series of three patients with metastatic disease demonstrated biopsy-proven hepatic ischemia in the absence of any discernible episodes of systemic hypotension [21, 22]. Additionally, cytokine-mediated liver injury has been implicated in lymphomatous infiltration [23]. Clinical suspicion and features suggestive of malignancy such as hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination along with computer tomography (CT) findings suggestive of an infiltrative process should prompt an attempt to obtain a biopsy for a definitive histological diagnosis. Radiological imaging including both ultrasonography and triple phase computer tomography should not solely be relied on due to their poor sensitivity for metastatic and lymphomatous infiltration of the liver. There are no specific biomarkers for tumour infiltration; elevations of ALT and AST with tumors are usually lower that than with ischemic hepatitis. Both appear to have greater sensitivity in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. However, jaundice does not always manifest in the setting of tumor infiltration and cases with over 90% liver infiltration without jaundice have been reported. A transjugular liver, bone marrow aspiration, and trephine (bone marrow) or lymph node biopsy can be invaluable tools for establishing a diagnosis. Confirmed malignancy is a absolute contraindication for liver transplantation, establishing a diagnosis is therefore crucial.\n",

The incidence of WD is approximately 1 in 30,000 and can present acutely, usually in pediatric or young female patients, or chronically in adults sometimes into their eighth decade of life. ALF in WD is unique as there is usually some preexisting liver disease at the time when ALF ensues. WD is diagnosed by measuring indices of copper metabolism, although in ALF these investigations can be misleadingly normal. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin, as an acute phase protein, can both be normal or elevated in other causes of ALF. Elevated levels of urinary copper are a good indicator of WD, but the high incidence of anuric acute kidney injury in ALF may eliminate this diagnostic tool. Ophthalmic exam of corneas can be useful to detect the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which in combination with liver disease and copper metabolism abnormalities strongly supports the diagnosis. Additionally, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and low serum cholinesterase levels can be a feature of WD [26].

Lactate concentrations in ALF may reflect sole circulatory disarray but also impaired hepatic clearance of lactate especially if adequate volume resuscitation has been implemented. Hyperlactatemia reflects liver, circulatory and cellular dysfunction; however the liver has a large reserve for lactate metabolism. Even after hepatectomy with resection of more than 50% of the liver lactate levels may remain normal [32]. High lactate levels are therefore frequently encountered in ALF where inadequate fluid resuscitation has lead to circulatory and cellular metabolism dysfunction. In general hyperlactatemia and the speed of its resolution acts as an important predictor of outcome in both critical illness and ALF [33]. Lactate is now recognized as an important prognostic variable. Persistently elevated lactate levels >3.0 mmol/L despite aggressive fluid resuscitation [34] have been incorporated into the Kings College Criteria (KCC) adding statistical strength to the original O\u2019Grady criteria [35].",

The diagnosis and treatment of critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) was first encountered in sepsis with the demonstration that low dose hydrocortisone could accelerate the reversal of shock, but no significant effect on mortality [38]. The high prevalence of CIRCI in ALF can be explained by factors that affect cortisol production and metabolism. Firstly, both ALF and sepsis often coexist and ALF represents an additional stress that can lead to RAI. Secondly, patients with ALF have low circulating cortisol levels for several reasons: the effects of low levels of HDL cholesterol that is central to cortisol production, increased conversion of cortisol to the inactive form cortisone and the negative effect of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) on hypothalamic function all contribute to the low circulating TC levels [39].",

This is mostly related to the decrease of both albumin and cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), that leads to an increase of free cortisol (FC) levels, despite low measured total cortisol (TC) levels. Various alternative measures or calculations have been explored to better assess FC levels. Salivary cortisol levels correlate well with FC although in ventilated patients this may be difficult to obtain. Alternatively, the free cortisol index (see equation below) that be calculated by measuring both CBG and TC levels correlates well with FC levels [41]. These alternative measures of FC may prove to be better methods of assessing RAI rather than relying on TC levels alone. However, hydrocortisone therapy is frequently initiated empirically to impact on escalating vasopressor levels.",

            "text": "Hepatic encephalopathy in ALF is one of the primary indications for intubation and ventilation in order to protect the airway from aspiration. A significant number of patients will also develop respiratory complications. ARDS complicates up to 30% of paracetamol-induced ALF cases [43]. It affects primarily those with significant vasopressor requirements and evidence of intracranial hypertension (ICH). The mechanisms of lung injury in ALF include the directly toxic effects of acetominophen and the release of vasoactive mediators that affect not only the brain and circulation but also the lungs causing an increased vascular permeability and capillary leak. This is further exacerbated by fluid accumulation within the extravascular compartments as a result of large volumes of fluid administration to support a vasoplegic circulation. Additionally, there is a high incidence (around 51%) of gram-negative organisms isolated from tracheal aspirates in intubated ALF patients [44], that directly impact the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The management of ICH increases the risk of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sepsis and ARDS as adequate sedation and specific measures to avoid hyperthermia contribute to limited tracheobronchial toilet and retention of secretions. Endotracheal tubes with a large volume, low pressure cuffs and a subglottic suction port may help to mitigate some of the VAP risks. Other respiratory complications associated with both mechanical ventilation and critical illness have been described in patients with ALF. These include pleural effusions, atelectasis, and poor compliance due to raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or reduced thoracic compliance due to chest wall edema.",

A balanced approach is often required, though low tidal volumes (6\u20138 mL/kg) can achieve normal partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) in most cases. Increased IAP and decreased lung compliance due to chest wall edema lead to increases in pleural pressure, rendering the plateau pressure a poor measure of transpulmonary pressure. Therefore, attempts to limit plateau pressure below 30 cm water can be difficult to attain and indeed are often unnecessary. The combination of ARDS with severely elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with intact physiological autoregulation requires tight control of PaCO2. When all conventional measures to optimize ventilation have been exhausted, extracorporeal devices can be considered but should be a strategy of last resort due the significant potential for bleeding complications associated with cannulae insertion and limb ischemia. Such devices have been used successfully in traumatic brain injury and ARDS [45] and have also been employed on few occasions in ALF patients associated with ARDS, when management of ICH has remained problematic [46].",

Consequently, high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is necessary to optimize recruitment and prevent atelectasis of basal lung segments. The adverse effect of high PEEP on ICH may be outweighed by the improvement of oxygenation and consequent improvement of cerebral blood flow. Recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning are usually contraindicated due to the impact on ICH. Refractory hypoxemia may be a reason to consider removing patients with ALF from the transplant waiting list. However, hypoxemia alone appears to be a nonspecific variable in the diagnosis of ARDS. Furthermore, a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is common, often transient and not necessarily associated with poor outcomes [47]. Transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output monitors can calculate an estimated measure of lung permeability, the extravascular lung water index, which can be a useful variable in guiding management [48].",

An assessment of the recovery of ICP auto regulatory mechanisms can be achieved by evaluating ICP responses to enforced elevations in PaCO2, mean arterial pressure and reductions in sedation. The return of ICP autoregulation permits a more sustained withdrawal of sedation and weaning from mandatory modes of ventilation. However, once sedation is decreased or stopped neurological problems may arise such as slow emergence from sedation or critical care delirium. Critical illness acquired weakness is highly prevalent, due to the significant number of risk factors for this condition encountered in ALF, including sepsis, profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), exposure to steroids, high protein catabolism and multi-organ failure [49]. A (percutaneous) tracheostomy is often necessary to facilitate weaning from the ventilator and sedating medication. Percutaneous tracheostomy can be performed safely in patients with ALF despite coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia [50].",

Previous concerns about TPN-induced liver toxicity are not observed with newer hypocaloric regimens [59]. Normal protein intake of approximately 1 g/kg/day does not seem to worsen hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. This is important, because ALF patients are often catabolic with supra-normal energy expenditure despite significant hepatocyte loss. Furthermore, there is significant protein catabolism with muscle wasting, amino acid losses, and vitamin deficiency, that can affect immune function. Therefore supplementation of multiple vitamins and trace elements in patients with ALF is necessary, especially in patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) regimen [60, 61]. Hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered with CRRT, especially high volume dialysis and requires prompt replacement. However, hypophosphatemia may also herald liver regeneration with increased hepatic ATP production and is considered as a good prognostic marker [62].\n",

These cells are involved in the profound release of cytokines as part of the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to sustained liver injury together with significant decrease of complement factors impairing opsonisation of bacteria [67]. Neutrophil function is impaired with reduced chemotaxis, bacteriocidal activity, and decreased production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Both monocytes and macrophages are involved in initiation, propagation, and resolution of acute liver injury. Shortly after acute liver injury macrophages release chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This pro-inflammatory state is balanced by anti-inflammatory responses that accompany the recruitment of monocytes to the site of the liver injury to initiate repair processes. Activated macrophages release TNF-a, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates, and lysosomal enzymes. These elevations of TNF correlate with the development of sepsis and increased IL-6 levels are associated with MOF and mortality (Fig. 3.3). High-volume plasma exchange (HVP) was recently studied in a randomized controlled trial. Patients with acute liver failure were randomized to either three cycles of HVP or standard medical therapy. HVP increased overall transplant-free survival with the largest effect on survival in patients who did not receive LT [68]. In this trial HVP was associated with significant reduction in circulating damage associated molecular pattern molecules and TNF-alpha, suggesting that HVP acts in part by controlling the innate immune response.\n\n",

Consequently, cellular mechanisms and the induction of apoptosis in renal tubular cells has been the focus of studies of paracetamol-induced nephrotoxicity. It is likely that the mechanism for nephrotoxicity lies with endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase-mediated apoptosis [73]. Other possible mechanisms include induction of oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes in the proximal tubule of the kidney [74].

ALF complicates the use of CRRT specifically when anticoagulation is required to extend filter life span. Despite the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia associated with ALF, CRRT circuits can clot as a result of losses of both pro- and anticoagulation factors [75]. Good vascular access, use of pre-dilution fluid replacement, high blood flows to reduce the ultrafiltration fraction, prompt attention to alarms and the use of prostacyclin anticoagulation may extend filter life. Prostacyclin has a half-life of seconds and therefore represents a safe anticoagulant in ALF in the absence of hemorrhage. Routine use of heparin for filter anticoagulation is not recommended and citrate anticoagulation is complicated by the risk of citrate toxicity, due to the integral role of the liver in citrate metabolism. However, the use of citrate-based intra-operative dialysis during a liver transplantation for a paracetamol-induced ALF patient and AKI with no signs of citrate toxicity has been reported [76]. The lack of toxicity was likely due to a low dose of citrate (0.8 mmol/L; only about one-fifth of the concentration necessary to achieve anticoagulation) and the predominant role of muscle metabolizing citrate.

Prothrombin time (PT) is a measure of the extrinsic pathway of the classic Y-shaped model of coagulation and reflects activity of clotting factors V, VII, and X. Factor VII with the shortest half-life of approximately 2 h, is a good marker of synthetic liver function and the extent of hepatic necrosis. Factor V is a good prognostic indicator in Hepatitis B induced ALF [81]. However as the measurement of individual clotting factor levels is not routinely available, PT is commonly used for prognostic assessment. In POD a PT greater than 36 s 36 h after ingestion predicts that 50% of patients will proceed to develop ALF. A PT increasing on day 4 after ingestion with a peak PT of greater than 180 s is predictive of a 65% mortality [82]. Prolonged PT however does not predict bleeding risk in ALF and thrombin generation tests may be a better reflection of coagulation status [83]. ALF impairs synthesis of pro- and anticoagulant factors and therefore ALF patients can develop hypercoagulable states as well as bleeding diathesis [84]. The use of blood products containing clotting factors will affect the utility of PT as a predictive marker. Blood products to correct coagulopathy should only be used when there is active bleeding or an invasive procedure such as ICP bolt insertion is to be undertaken.\n",

A retrospective analysis of patients with ALF who were medically managed between 1973 and 1985 was performed with the aim of identifying significant clinical prognostic parameters. The King\u2019s College criteria (KCC : INR, hepatic encephalopathy, acidosis, serum creatinine and lactate) have become the most widely used criteria for assessing prognosis in ALF. The KCC have a high specificity for mortality without transplantation but a low sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). Quality of life is significantly affected by transplantation and should be included as an aspect of the decision-making process especially for those patients with POD, who may also have chronic psychiatric conditions. The need to avoid unnecessary transplantations and the scarcity of donor organs have mandated an ongoing search for additional parameters that can predict prognosis earlier. Persistently elevated blood lactate has been closely associated with mortality and consequently incorporated into the KCC for paracetamol-related ALF [34]. The KCC have been developed for both paracetamol- and nonparacetamol-related ALF to assist decisions regarding referral to specialist centers that perform LT and to decide whom to priority list for transplantation as outlined in Tables 3.2 and 3.3.\n",

Additionally, optimization of the circulation with both appropriate early invasive monitoring directing aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support and assessment for high-volume plasma exchange is the key. The early use of empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents along with strict infection control measures are necessary. Due to the high frequency of sepsis without SIRS symptoms a low threshold for obtaining cultures and broadening antibiotic coverage is required when the clinical condition deteriorates. A keen awareness of the potential for raised ICH, particularly in the young, necessitates appropriate monitoring and management, which will be discussed in detail in a separate chapter. In parallel with supportive measures an assessment of the clinical history and prognostic variables must be undertaken to determine, which patient fulfills national transplantation criteria. The decision to list a patient for super-urgent liver transplantation is often difficult and can be affected by age, co-morbidities, the dynamics of the clinical condition and psychosocial factors. [6] The clinical course for those not transplanted is often precarious and associated with a high mortality [5]. Outcome is affected by the speed and degree of hepatic regeneration and the impact of the cumulative insults such as sepsis, AKI requiring prolonged RRT, and critical illness associated weakness that may result in extended periods of rehabilitation in those that survive. Patients who proceed to transplantation and receive a good functioning graft often experience swift resolution of the circulatory and neurovascular disarray and have significantly improved outcomes albeit offset by the long-term impact of lifelong immunosuppression.",
