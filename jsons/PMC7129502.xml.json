Few other CNS diseases are characterised by high concentrations of IgG and oligoclonal bands (table\n). All those diseases that have high IgG concentrations are inflammatory and most are infectious.9 Furthermore, when the specificity of the high concentrations of IgG and oligoclonal bands in those diseases was studied, IgG was found to be antibody directed against the disease cause. For example, the oligoclonal IgG found in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis brains and CSF is directed against measles virus,10 not herpes simplex virus or mumps virus, and in cryptococcal meningitis, the IgG is directed against cryptococcus11 and not another fungus such as candida. These findings provide a rationale for the hypothesis that the oligoclonal IgG in MS brain and CSF is antibody directed against the cause of MS.",

Epidemiological studies of MS have found a geographical pattern of increasing prevalence with increasing latitude north and south of the equator. This pattern of prevalence led to the question of whether MS would be affected by migration between regions with high and low prevalence. Earlier migration studies suggested that the risk of acquiring MS is largely established before age 15 years, but more recent studies suggest that the risk may happen over many years and is not restricted to childhood and early adult life.12, 13 Analysis of the data on MS from the Faroe Islands suggested a point-source epidemic acquired over a wide age range,14 but the data have been challenged.15 Two possibilities explain the epidemiological data. The \u201cprevalence\u201d hypothesis of MS suggests that the disease is most common where the causative agent is most widespread. By contrast, the \u201cpolio\u201d hypothesis suggests that acquisition of early in life (eg, maternal antibody or that produced after infection in infancy) reduces the likelihood that the agent will ever reach the CNS, but that primary infection after puberty or in adult life results in a small incidence of CNS infection, leading to MS.16\n",

Dyment and colleagues21 incorrectly rejected the hypothesis that MS could be viral; they reasoned that, because the frequency of MS in adopted relatives was no higher than would be expected, the disorder is not caused by a virus. First, in almost all viral infections of the CNS, the ratio of cases to infections is low. For example, poliomyelitis and postinfectious measles encephalomyelitis occur in one person per 500\u20132000 people infected. The risk of acquiring MS in an environment shared with adopted (non-biological) relatives would be expected to be the same as in the general population (1 in 1000) because the disorder to infection ratio of MS is likely to be low, and the period over which MS is acquired is probably decades.13 Accordingly, the frequency of MS in adopted relatives would not be expected to rise above that in the general population if the disease were caused by a virus. Indeed, that is what Dyment and colleagues21 found. Thus, their interpretation that MS is not infectious because there was no difference between adoptees and their relatives is flawed. The high risk of MS in siblings and twins is most probably due to a combination of virus infection superimposed on a predisposing genetic background. Even in models of demyelination in mice produced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, there is a crucial genetic component. For example, after infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus caused by injection of the virus into the brain, demyelination develops in SJL/J mice, but not in C57 black mice. Therefore, there seems to be a genetic predisposition to MS, but there is no genetic disorder in which the brain and CSF contain oligoclonal bands.",

Because smallpox vaccination has been discontinued and most people are immunised against measles virus, postinfectious encephalomyelitis is now rare. However, many viruses might produce demyelination, as suggested by the temporal association of postinfectious encephalomyelitis after smallpox vaccination, or after measles, and also varicella or rubella infection.

Each of these viruses is capable of establishing a persistent infection in their host, such that there is continuous virus replication over a long period without killing the host. The replicative capacity of such viruses could be attenuated or restricted in the cells they infect to prevent elimination by the immune system.

The same organism, Treponema pallidum, causes all these forms of neurosyphilis. Similarly, in some patients with MS perivascular inflammation is prominent; others have little more than optic atrophy, or may even develop a solitary demyelinating lesion that mimics tumour. Besides T pallidum, other organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and various fungi can produce chronic CNS disease with differing pathologies.

Although the viral hypothesis is not supported by binding inability, the putative MS virus might be latent and of low abundance in the brain. During virus latency in the nervous system, infectious virus is not produced, and viral gene expression is limited. For example, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus are both latent in human ganglia, and antibody against either virus does not bind to human ganglia. However, latent virus can produce clinical disease on reactivation by unknown stimuli.

In cell fusion, a fusing agent brings the membranes of two cells together to produce a heterokaryon (a cell containing different nuclei inside a common cytoplasm). Use of inactivated Sendai virus (a parainfluenza virus) as the fusing agent and pH 7\u00b70, which had been shown to be optimum for heterokaryon production, led to the isolation of a parainfluenza virus (6/94 virus) from brains from patients with MS.28 However, 6/94 virus did not prove to be the cause of MS. Furthermore, because Sendai virus is a parainfluenza virus, it might not have been completely inactivated. Lysolecithin and eventually polyethylene glycol were tried as the fusing agent. Cells from the brains of many patients with MS were fused with indicator cells. The explanted MS brain cells were assessed before and after cell fusion, not only for a spontaneous cytopathic effect, but also for binding to measles virus, herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus), coxsackie and ECHO viruses, rubella, influenza A and B, and coronaviruses by indirect immunofluorescence with various antisera. Explanted and fused MS brain cells were also inoculated into embryonated hen eggs, in which influenza and parainfluenza viruses are readily propagated, and into rodent species and chimpanzees in an attempt to produce neurological disease. Although no agent specific for MS was found, an endogenous mouse picornavirus (the WW strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus) that produces demyelination was isolated.27 In addition, one chimpanzee inoculated intracerebrally with MS brain cells developed demyelinating disease, and cytomegalovirus was subsequently isolated from the brain of this animal;29 the virus was identified as a chimpanzee strain of cytomegalovirus.30 Inoculation of both chimpanzee and mouse with brain xenografts (MS cells) induced reactivation of an endogenous virus that can cause demyelination. Overall, virus was not found in the brain of any of the patients analysed.31\n",

In an analysis of the humoral immune responses to C pneumoniae in paired serum and CSF samples of patients with definite MS and other inflammatory and non-inflammatory neurological disorders, no difference in seropositivity was found between the groups, although titres of IgG specific for C pneumoniae were substantially higher in the CSF of patients with MS than in controls. 16 (31%) of 52 patients with MS who were seropositive showed intrathecal synthesis of IgG specific for C pneumoniae compared with only one (2%) of 43 seropositive controls, and was strongly associated with intrathecal synthesis of polyclonal-specific IgG directed against C pneumoniae in 13 of 16 patients with MS. However, high titres of antibody to C pneumoniae in the CSF of patients with MS were not significantly correlated with disease duration, disease course, clinical or MRI disease activity, disability, or presence of oligoclonal IgG.34 Overall, many studies have assessed a possible relation between C pneumoniae and MS but none have found one.35 Further, an organism larger than a virus (eg, a rickettsial agent or a bacterium) is unlikely to have been missed by the many electron microscopists who have assessed MS plaques ultrastructurally.",

The summary odds ratio for patients with MS comparing EBV-seropositive with EBV-seronegative individuals was 13\u00b75 (95% CI 6\u00b73\u201331\u00b74), a finding that the investigators believed supported a role for EBV in the cause of MS.51 Bray and colleagues52 found antibodies to the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen in 85% of patients with MS compared with 13% of EBV-seropositive controls. Furthermore, a prospective serological study of 62 439 women53 found substantial increases in serum titres of anti-EBV before the onset of MS, particularly antibody to the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2. An unexpected finding was the late onset of disease in most of the women who developed MS (median age 52 years). Unfortunately, no CSF data were available; such data are important because the IgG in MS brain and CSF is synthesised intrathecally and might reflect the immune response at the site of disease. The strongest predictors of MS were serum concentrations of IgG antibodies to the EBV viral capsid antigen or the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen complex.54 Finally, because strong associations between EBV antibodies and the risk of MS were already apparent from samples collected from patients with MS 5 years or more before onset of disease, late EBV infection could have a role in MS.55\n",

We know that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and that RNA becomes protein. The continuous production of increased amounts of IgG in the brain (figure 1) and CSF in MS suggest the presence of an antigen (probably a protein) against which the IgG is directed. The RNA from which this protein was translated could be used to identify the putative unique MS antigen. RNA can be readily extracted from the brain of patients with MS. Although RNA degrades quickly, it can be reverse-transcribed into cDNA, which are stable molecules. There are many methods by which cDNA libraries of a brain, containing all genes expressed in that brain, can be used to identify genes and RNA unique to disease. For example, the ability to prepare and characterise libraries of genes from human tissue has allowed the isolation of cDNA clones derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) without prior knowledge of the virus, the viral genome, or the presence of circulating viral antibodies.73 Abundance of HCV-specific RNA in total liver RNA of infected animals is 0\u00b700001%.73 Combined cloning in expression vectors (even without subtraction hybridisation) and immunological screening of about a million recombinant phages (prepared from a cDNA library derived from infectious material and constructed in bacteriophage) led to the identification of an HCV-specific antigen.",

Because the antigen in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is known to be measles virus, the parallel findings in MS suggest an antigen-driven immune response76 rather than a non conventional mechanism of B-cell activation. Furthermore, the antigen-driven clonal B-lymphocyte and plasma-cell response has been found after a single clinically isolated syndrome,77, 78 which suggests that detection of the disease-relevant antigens in early CNS demyelination may bear on the inciting antigens in MS.
