Since then, our health situation has improved by applying these simple rules of thumb, and even more through improved technologies such as good animal management, hygiene and biosecurity, vaccination programs and prudent animal drug treatment. Nowadays, some of the most feared zoonotic diseases such as anthrax or brucellosis are absent in many countries. However, there are still many important diseases that threaten human health and which have animals as their reservoir. These animal reservoirs range from wildlife to domestic animals, both in companionship and agricultural settings.

Basically, zoonotic diseases related to food animals can be separated into three groups. In the first group are diseases with a potential for global spread and with a dramatic public relations potential, often these diseases have a significant human reservoir showing human-human transmission, e.g. SARS, avian influenza and certain types of AMR bacteria. The second group is constituted by persistent zoonotic diseases related to the industrialized food production chain, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, which are broadly distributed in the farm-to-fork chain. These human pathogens are often non-pathogenic in animals and seem to be distributed in all countries, both rich and poor. In the third group are the 'neglected zoonotic diseases'. They are zoonotic diseases which have been eradicated (or drastically reduced) in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies, and through introduction of hygienic and animal biosafety management practices. However, in many poor settings these diseases are 'neglected diseases' and receive very little attention from national authorities or even international organizations. This group includes Brucella, bovine TB (tuberculosis), i.e. Mycobacterium bovis, and many parasitic diseases, e.g. leishmaniasis and cysticercosis.

The foodborne transmission route is probably the most important gateway for this contact, and the vast majority of human infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, occur through this route. For other diseases there is evidence that transmission also occurs via direct contact between (food) animal and humans, e.g. live-stock associated methicillin resistant Staphlylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Graveland et al. 2011) . Next, there is transmission via the environment (e.g. surface water or water used to irrigate plants) mainly as a result of spreading of manure into the environment (Spencer and Guan 2004; Hutchison et al. 2005) .

In many developing countries, wildlife forms an additional important reservoir for foodborne pathogens, not only through consumption of wildlife. Because of often lower bio-safety levels in these countries, direct contact between humans and food animals is generally more frequent, and diseases from the wildlife community may cross over more easily to domestic animals. For instance, the general understanding now is that the SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in direct human contact with and/or consumption of wildlife, or indirectly through contact between wildlife and domestic animals (Guan et al. 2003; Shi and Hu 2008) . Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including some of the most feared, such as Ebola, rabies and anthrax and, and in contrast to other food sources, much of the consumption of wildlife goes undetected by food controlling agencies.

Outbreaks of viral diseases in humans, originating in or spreading through farm animals (avian flu-H5N1 and swine flu-H1N1) have caused major global alerts in the last decade. These influenza outbreaks spread very quickly, either in the animal population (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1), and formed a global threat for human health. H1N1 was therefore characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. Although in total the human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses is probably many fold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few but fast spreading outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. In addition, the failure to predict, monitor and control the spread of these diseases in animals presented regulators and politicians with a wake-up call, and made them demand (better) cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors. Prions, non-living infectious agents, have been a significant burden of disease in animal and man. The most well-known zoonotic prion disease is probably the one causing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, as represented by the massive outbreak of 'Mad Cow Disease' in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. This agent, a mutant protein, which mainly sits in the brain, got into the (beef) food chain by the feeding of ruminant derived meat and bone meal to ruminants. Prions (Prusiner 1997) , Scrapie (the disease in goats), spongiform encephalopathy of Rocky Mountain elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were known before the large outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the UK. It, however, took some time and great efforts, and an early One Health approach, to establish the links between the different animal diseases and the human disease (Hill et al. 1997; Prusiner 1998; Ghani et al. 1998 ). This insight created a background to efficiently stop the spread of this prion disease, by banning the use of animals in animal feed, and seeing a subsequent decrease of the disease in humans (Hoinville 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1686, "end": 1701, "text": "(Prusiner 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2121, "text": "(Hill et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2136, "text": "Prusiner 1998;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2154, "text": "Ghani et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2366, "text": "(Hoinville 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Zoonoses with a Dramatic Public Relations Impact and Potential for Global Spread"}, {"text": "In the Western world prion diseases have attracted much attention, and their control has resulted in a large economic burden to society.

It should be realized that most countries-including most developing countries-produce large amounts of food animals, and most of the production takes place in some sort of industrialized setting. Such settings are invariably linked to a number of important zoonotic pathogens. Table 10 .1 shows three lists of the most important food pathogens, as reported in studies published by the CDC in the USA and by RIVM (Havelaar et al. 2012 ) in the Netherlands, as well as a list of pathogens recognized by ECDC as focus organisms for the EU. Although widespread, these pathogens are often not recognized as important human pathogens because of their often mild disease syndromes in healthy persons (e.g. limited to diarrhea and vomiting) and because of the complexity of source attribution. However, they do form a serious threat to the vulnerable segments of our societies (i.e. the young, the elderly, the immune-compromised and recovering patients), and some patients may develop long-lasting chronic disorders (e.g. arthritis and neurological disorders) (McKenna 2012). These facts, together with the sheer number of infections they cause, results in a substantial total burden of disease for these pathogens as expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) (see Murray 1994) . For instance, the study of Havelaar et al. (2012) showed that the total burden of the 14 diseases he studied was 13,500 DALYs, for a total of 1.8 million cases and 233 deaths caused by these diseases (in 16 million people). Source attribution estimates showed that one-third could be attributed to foodborne transmission. Similarly large numbers were reported for the USA (CDC 2011), where surveillance studies of 31 known pathogens gave an estimated total of 9.4 million illnesses, 55,961 hospitalization and 1,351 deaths attributed to foodborne diseases (in 315 million people). Importantly, the latter report also showed that the 31 pathogens studied make up only 44 % of the foodborne diseases, and the majority of 56 % is caused by unknown agents. This situation is probably not unique for the USA, and thus indicates that there is still much health to be gained from improved food safety. Table 10 .1 shows that an almost identical list of Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), are a combined estimate of the burden of disease due to both death and morbidity. One DALY can be thought of as 1 year of healthy life lost and is often expressed in years of life lost on the population level, and can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where each individual in the population lives to old age, free from disease and disability (Murray 1994) For the list of the CDC and the Netherlands the ranking in terms of incidence, hospitalizations, deaths or DALY is given. The list from ECDC was generated by expert consultation and for use as an EU focus list in future disease burden studies important foodborne pathogens are found in Europe, and that Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, rotaviruses, noroviruses and Salmonella, should probably form the key targets for interventions. Except for norovirus, these pathogens have been shown to be zoonotic, and find their way to humans via food and the environment ( Fig. 10 .1).

This is typically done through the construction of zoonosis centers or their equivalents. These centers aim to stimulate and facilitate the collaboration between human, veterinary and food institutes. Some examples of such specialized centers are the US National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid), the British National Centre for Zoonosis Research (http://www.zoonosis.ac.uk/ zoonosis) and Danish Zoonosis Centre which is part of the Danish National Food Institute (http://www.food.dtu.dk/English/Research/Research_Groups/Zoonosis_ Centre.aspx). Two clear examples of what such centers can accomplish are: the reduction of Salmonella in food animals in Denmark, and the Danish integrated approach to combat AMR (described below in a separate section). In the Danish Salmonella reduction program, data sharing across animal, food and human health sectors has enabled science-based solutions, and has most noticeably resulted in significant reductions in human salmonellosis through lowering Salmonella prevalence in animals (Wegener et al. 2003) . In relation to laying hens the program started with a simple and inexpensive serological surveillance of egg producers. Flocks found positive were either culled and repopulated, or used to produce heat-processed eggs, Danish eggs are now considered free of Salmonella. Next to this arm, a program of surveillance and eradication of infected broiler flocks was setup.

This is the reason why the WHO refers to these diseases as 'Neglected Diseases' (WHO 2006; Molyneux et al. 2011) . Neglected diseases may be categorized into two (strongly overlapping) categories. In the first category are the neglected tropical diseases which include Chagas disease, trypanosomiasis, leprosy, rabies, schistosomiasis and others, many of which are zoonotic and parasitic diseases. 2 The second category are the neglected zoonotic diseases, covering many of the diseases above and also some bacterial diseases such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis (TB), brucellosis, and also cysticercosis and echinococcosis. 3 Many of the neglected diseases are carried by wildlife and in poor and rural settings by livestock (e.g. brucellosis, anthrax, leptospirosis, Q-fever and bovine TB). In addition, many are food-and waterborne (e.g. brucellosis, cysticercosis/ taeniasis and echinococcosis). In particular, the prevalence of bovine TB appears to be increasing in many poor settings and has been linked to HIV infections as an important factor for progression of a TB infection to an active TB disease (LoBue et al. 2010) .

All use, but in particular the use as AGP, resulted in a dramatic rise in the use of antibiotics, and for instance, between 1951 and 1978 the use in the United States alone went from 110 to 5,580 t (WHO 2011).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AMR in Food Animals"}, {"text": "However, the use of antibiotics in animals has over the years also resulted in a selective pressure for AMR microorganisms, contributing significantly to the human health problem of AMR bacteria.

In particular the use as AGP is questionable, as the concentrations used are sub-therapeutic which result in the selection for resistance but do not efficiently kill microorganisms. Nowadays there are serious efforts by national authorities and some international organizations to reduce the antibiotic overuse in animals (Food Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)/WHO 2003; WHO 2011; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2012)), especially-but not only-through abolishing their use as AGP.
