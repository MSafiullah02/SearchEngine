            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunosuppressed patients, such as those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation [Solano and Navarro, 2010]. Nevertheless, recent data suggest that CMV may also be a relevant cause of morbidity in patients lacking canonical immunosuppression and displaying various inflammatory processes, including cardiovascular, autoimmune, and chronic bowel diseases [S\u00f6derberg\u2010Naucl\u00e9r, 2008; N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2010, 2012]. In these patients, active CMV infection is detected frequently in either the inflamed tissues or even the blood compartment. Furthermore, active CMV infection, either restricted to the lower respiratory tract or involving both the lower respiratory airways and the systemic compartment, has been shown to occur frequently during critically illness in adult CMV\u2010seropositive patients [Chilet et al., 2010; Blanquer et al., 2011], and has been associated with prolonged intensive care unit hospitalization, extended periods of mechanical ventilation, higher rates of nosocomial infection, and overall mortality [for review, see Kalil and Florescu, 2009]. From a pathogenetic perspective, data obtained in the murine CMV model indicate that a pro\u2010inflammatory state is a critical factor in promoting CMV replication [Cook et al., 2002], and that TNF\u2010\u03b1, a cytokine known to transactivate the expression of CMV immediate\u2010early genes, plays a critical role in triggering CMV reactivation [Pr\u00f6sch et al., 1995]. In this context, active CMV infection may occur in pediatric patients with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases in which inflammation plays potentially a major pathogenic role. The current study was undertaken to investigate this hypothesis.",

Involvement of the systemic compartment was demonstrated in two of the six patients with detectable CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract. Low CMV DNA loads were usually observed in both compartments. The above scenario resembles that seen in critically ill patients subjected to mechanical ventilation. In these patients, it was demonstrated that a rapid expansion of CMV\u2010specific functional CD8+ T cells occurs upon CMV reactivation, keeping viral loads at low levels in both compartments and eventually controlling the episode [Chilet et al., 2010; Blanquer et al., 2011].",

Despite the stable clinical condition of the patients at the time of fibrobronchoscopy, respiratory viruses were detected in almost one\u2010third of the patients. Although contamination with viruses present in the upper respiratory tract could not be formally excluded, this feature is consistent with either a delayed clearance of a recent acute viral infection episode or with a persistent viral infection of the lower respiratory airways. The plausibility of the latter explanation is supported by data obtained in experimental animal models, and also in humans for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections [Schwarze et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2009]. Persistent replication of these viruses in the lower respiratory tract induces inflammation [Papadopoulos et al., 2000], and may thereby promote local CMV reactivation. In turn, CMV may also potentiate respiratory virus replication in the lower respiratory tract by virtue of its immunosuppressive capacity [Solano and Navarro, 2010]. Nevertheless, no significant association was found between the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract and the occurrence of respiratory viruses. Likewise, the occurrence of active CMV infection in critically ill patients has been related to an increased incidence of bacterial and fungal super infection [Jaber et al., 2005; Chiche et al., 2009]. The current investigation also found no association between the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract and the occurrence of bacterial or fungal species. However, this study was not specifically designed to investigate these potential pathogenic interactions, and so no definitive conclusions may be drawn on this issue.",

Fourthly, although cell supernatants were used for PCR analyses, the possibility that the detection of CMV DNA reflected a latent rather than an active viral infection in some patients, specially those with low CMV DNA loads, could not be formally ruled out, as neither detection of viral mRNA nor inoculation of conventional cell cultures for recovery of live virus were performed. Nevertheless, the data reported warrant further prospective observational studies to confirm the findings presented, explore the possibility of the existence of pathogenetic interactions between CMV, HHV\u20106, and respiratory viruses, or bacterial and fungal species, colonizing the lower respiratory airways of these patients and assess the potential impact of CMV replication in the lower respiratory tract on the clinical course and outcome of the patients.
