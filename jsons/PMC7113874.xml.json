            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. The family Coronaviridae is genetically and antigenically divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and King, 2012). The epidemiological investigation and phylogenetic analysis of CoVs revealed that bats are the likely natural host for the \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs, while birds are the suspect host for \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs (Bolles et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2012). To date, there are six CoVs that cause respiratory tract illness in humans, including \u03b1-CoVs, human CoV (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-229E, and \u03b2-CoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2015). In pigs, there are also two \u03b1-CoVs and one \u03b4-CoV that cause enteric disease: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), respectively (Jung et al., 2016). The other swine \u03b1-CoV, porcine respiratory coronarivurs (PRCV), and the swine \u03b2-CoV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), induce respiratory and neurological diseases in pigs, respectively (Saif et al., 2012).5",

Thus, the development of molecular methods to detect a broad-range of CoVs, including previously unidentified CoVs, in biological samples from animals is a critical initial step to prepare for potential epidemics by newly emerging CoVs. Previously, a one-step RT-PCR with the pancoronavirus (panCoV)-specific forward (IN-2deg; GGGDTGGGAYTAYCCHAARTGYGA) and reverse (IN-4deg; TARCAVACAACISYRTCRTCA) universal primers targeting a 452-bp fragment of the polymerase gene was used to detect a bovine-like \u03b2-CoV in the diarrheic feces of a giraffe (Hasoksuz et al., 2007) and an \u03b1-CoV in mink feces (Vlasova et al., 2011). Our preliminary studies revealed that the previously established panCoV RT-PCR assay failed to detect the newly emerged PDCoV in the diarrheic pig feces, although the feces were positive for PDCoV RNA by PDCoV-specific RT-PCR. However testing for \u03b1-CoVs (PEDV and TGEV), \u03b2-CoV (bovine enteric CoV; BCoV), and \u03b3-CoVs [avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), and turkey CoV (TCoV)] was positive.",

CoVs are frequently detected in the feces of wild birds, which may act as reservoirs for avian \u03b3- and \u03b4-CoVs analyse (Duraes-Carvalho et al., 2015; Torres et al., 2017). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two isolates clustered in the \u03b4-CoVs genus and had the closest relationship with wild avian CoV strains, indicating the existence of \u03b4-CoV in avian fecal samples from the US. The other one belonged to the \u03b3-CoV genus. Complete genome sequencing of these 3 avian CoVs is needed to further characterize these new strains.",
