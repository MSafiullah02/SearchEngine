Otitis media can present either as an acute infectious process of the middle ear (acute otitis media) or as a serous noninfectious process (otitis media with effusion). Otitis externa is an infectious inflammatory condition of the external auditory canal (EAC). Approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media have evolved over the last several decades as new immunizations, and more antibiotic choices have become available.",

Otorrhea, adjacent cervical lymph node enlargement, and local cellulitis may develop later in the course of more severe cases. The most common bacterial causes of OE include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [1] . Typical physical examination findings include erythema and edema of the EAC with debris, cerumen, and purulent material filling the canal. Visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM) is often obstructed by the otorrhea and the swelling associated with the inflammation. An unimpaired view of a normal TM, with visible landmarks, is shown in . When the EAC is cultured, one must be cognizant that culture results may reflect EAC flora rather than a causative organism. First-line antibiotic treatments include topical otic drops of a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin with or without topical glucocorticoid drops. If edema of the EAC is severe, placement of a wick inside the EAC may be necessary to ensure delivery of medication to the more proximal areas of infection. Risk of recurrence of OE is increased in individuals with atopic dermatitis, seborrhea, immune compromise, and repeated local trauma to the area when cleaning the ear. A fungal etiology of the infection should be considered when otorrhea is prolonged, especially if topical antibacterials and a wick have been used already. Individuals who use hearing aids and those who have had recent bacterial infections are also at risk for fungal disease. The most common fungal etiologies include Aspergillus and Candida species [1] .",

Under normal conditions, the eustachian tube allows the middle ear to drain to the pharynx and to equalize pressure between the middle ear and the environment. Impaired drainage may be present for several reasons. The anatomic position of the shorter eustachian tube in young children maintains a relatively horizontal orientation allowing the drainage to defy gravity. Adenoidal hypertrophy and anatomic anomalies of the palate can also block or impair normal drainage. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic rhinitis, and viral upper respiratory infections can all lead to inflammation of the eustachian tube and surrounding tissues resulting in the presence of increased secretions in the middle ear that accumulates because the eustachian tube is not fully patent [2] [3] [4] . In each of these clinical scenarios, negative pressure develops in the eustachian tube and middle ear space. The small number of bacteria normally present in those secretions replicates in the now closed space resulting in acute infection (AOM). Retained nasopharyngeal secretions are very common in individuals with otherwise uncomplicated viral respiratory infections. A subgroup of these individuals experience secondary bacterial infection because the initial viral infection and its associated inflammation allow for the closed space conditions where the bacteria can thrive.",

Less common bacterial etiologies of AOM include Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A streptococcus, the cause of \"strep throat\") and Staphylococcus aureus. S. pyogenes is more commonly seen among those older than 5 years of age. Its presentation is typically quite aggressive leading to perforation of the TM and/or accompanying mastoiditis [2] .

A thorough otoscopic exam, including pneumatic otoscopy and clear visualization of the TM and EAC, is essential. Presuming a diagnosis of AOM in the absence of a thorough examination leads to overdiagnosis and subsequent overuse of antibiotics. Pneumatic otoscopy should always be included to assess the mobility of the TM. Efficient pneumatic otoscopy is aided by using a speculum with a tight seal of the EAC [4] . Classic otoscopy findings of AOM include the presence of fluid in middle ear space, outward bulging of the TM secondary to the increased pressure in the middle ear space, loss of visualization of ossicle bony landmarks behind the TM, and erythema or injection of radial vessels on the TM. The middle ear effusion is purulent in AOM but must be carefully distinguished from opaque noninfectious effusions secondary to OME. The absence of erythema of the TM suggests a diagnosis of OME, not AOM. A bulging TM with decreased mobility on pneumatic otoscopy is the most specific exam finding for bacterial AOM [4] . The presence of purulent otorrhea in the EAC is seen if a TM perforation has occurred before the time of examination. This finding must be distinguished from the edema and erythema that occur along the EAC during otitis externa. Bullae may be present on the TM in conjunction with other signs of acute inflammation. The findings are consistent with a form of AOM termed bullous myringitis. The presence of bullae does not suggest a specific microbiologic cause nor does it change the clinical approach to the condition.",

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is incited by predisposing factors such as viral upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, environmental pollutants, nasal septum anomalies, other craniofacial anomalies, adenoidal hypertrophy, masses, polyps, or the presence of a foreign body. Risk factors include smoking, second-hand smoke exposure, and extensive dental disease. All of these conditions impede mucociliary clearance of sinus secretions.

The technique is modestly invasive and now seldom performed outside of academic settings, clinical trials, and severe or particularly enigmatic cases [7] . Not unexpectedly, the common causes of sinus infections are nearly identical to the list of pathogens that cause AOM since both processes arise from bacteria that normally inhabit the human upper respiratory tract at low concentrations. The most common bacterial agents of ABRS include S. pneumoniae, non-typeable H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. S. pneumoniae and non-typeable H. influenzae are equally common in the post-pneumococcal vaccine era with each accounting for approximately 30% of cases. Infection with M. catarrhalis is less frequent at an estimated 10% of total cases [5, 6] . Formal sinus aspirate studies have reported that approximately 30% of nasal sinus aspirates are culture negative for bacteria [7] . Less common causes of ABRS include S. aureus and S. pyogenes. Anaerobic bacteria have also been implicated either as a primary pathogen or as co-pathogens in several adult studies including Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus species.

Viral upper respiratory tract infections usually begin with symptoms of clear, watery, nasal discharge. As the infection and associated inflammation proceed, the discharge becomes thicker and often takes on a yellow-green color. This change is expected during a viral infection and does not herald the presence of a bacterial process. The change in color and consistency is secondary to innate immune responses to the virus, with recruitment of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase allows for some of the oxygenfree radicals to be converted to hypochlorite. It is the presence of this halogenated compound that renders the color change, not the presence of bacteria. Acute bacterial infections trigger the same innate immune inflammatory pathways, explaining why the discharge seen during a bacterial infection also has a yellow-green color.

The mastoid sinuses are networks of air cells divided by bony septae located in the posterior portion of both temporal bones. The space connects to the middle ear by a bony passage that is present at birth and increases in size until approximately 2 years of age. As the bony passages grow, they become lined with epithelium contiguous to the middle ear space. This continuity of epithelium allows for the possibility for infections of the middle ear to spread to the mastoid. The mastoids are bordered anteromedially by the middle ear and ossicles, the facial nerve, the bony portion of the EAC, the jugular vein, and the internal carotid artery and medially by the inner ear. The sigmoid sinuses are immediately posterior to the mastoids. The cranial fossa sits above, and the soft tissue and muscles of the lateral neck sit below the mastoids on both sides [8, 9] .",

Interestingly, patients who have recently been treated with antibiotics for AOM have some of the highest rates of complications. This suggests that causative bacteria are particularly pathogenic or have become resistant to more conservative treatments [11] . Known complications involve contiguous spread of the infection to adjacent structures and include subperiosteal abscesses, Bezold's abscesses (infection of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle attachments), facial nerve paralysis, meningitis, subdural empyema, brain abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, labyrinthitis, temporal bone osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea, or conductive hearing loss secondary to destruction of the bony ossicles. Progressive disease can lead to systemic infection with bacteremia and distal septic emboli. A rare but classic complication known as Gradenigo's syndrome is diagnosed when there is petrositis with associated otitis media, ipsilateral medial rectus palsy, eye pain, and possible additional cranial nerve abnormalities [8] .",

Seven days into his illness, he developed fevers and began tugging on his right ear. His provider diagnosed him with right AOM and treated him with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. Two days into his course of amoxicillin, he seemed to improve and his fevers resolved. Two days after he completed his antibiotic course, his fevers returned and his mother noticed redness and swelling behind his right ear. On physical examination, the boy appeared fussy and slightly ill. He had clear rhinorrhea. His left EAC and TM were unremarkable. His right TM showed dullness and erythema with visible pus behind it. His right EAC was mildly erythematous and edematous. Manipulation of the right pinna and palpation of the posterior auricular area were quite painful. The postauricular area was erythematous and edematous, but without fluctuance. The right pinna was slightly displaced anteriorly. ",
