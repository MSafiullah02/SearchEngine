            "text": "Airborne transmission of certain viruses can lead to widespread outbreaks of severe illnesses. Due to their potential to cause pandemics and sometimes fatal diseases, it is very important to understand and control the dynamics of airborne virus transmission. This pathway has been recognized as the most effective route for transmitting episodic respiratory viruses (e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus and H7N9 Influenza virus) and those more frequent respiratory infectious diseases such as seasonal flu and common colds that can lead to pneumonia (Brankston et al., 2007, Goldmann, 2000, Lapinsky, 2010, Otter et al., 2016, Wang, 2013, Yu et al., 2004). Many virus aerosols are classified by their size under the category of ultrafine particles (UFPs, with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 100 nm) as the size of viruses ranges from 20 to 300 nm, and typically less than 100 nm (Pease, 2012). This magnifies the concern regarding airborne transmission of the pathogenic viruses since the UFPs can travel long distances (Alonso, Raynor, Davies, & Torremorell, 2015) and penetrate deep into the alveoli region of the human respiratory system (Milton, Fabian, Cowling, Grantham, & McDevitt, 2013). To gain a better understanding of the presence of virus aerosols and better ascertain the inhalation risks they pose, efficient collection of viable virus aerosol is needed.",

A significant fraction (42%) of the influenza viruses dispersing into the air after a human cough were detected in airborne particles smaller than 1 \u00b5m (Lindsley, Blachere, & Thewlis, 2010). Therefore, the mentioned samplers are inherently ineffective for these ultrafine virus particles. For example, the BioSampler\u00ae (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) has been widely used for bacterial and fungal collection, but its collection efficiency is less than 10% for particles smaller than 100 nm (Hogan et al., 2005). In addition to efficient physical collection, preserving viability of the virus aerosol is the other critical factor in assessing the health risk associated with airborne transmission of pathogenic virus.",

            "text": "To address the abovementioned drawbacks, several studies proposed the use of water vapor condensation to amplify the size of virus aerosol particles before collection by inertial impaction (Oh et al., 2010, Pan et al., 2016). When the partial pressure of water vapor exceeds its saturation vapor pressure, supersaturation condition is established and subsequently condensation of water on colder surfaces occurs (Kousaka, Niida, Okuyama, & Tanaka, 1982). There are three common approaches for establishing the supersaturation condition to enlarge airborne particles: 1) mixing a hot saturated vapor with the flow of incoming particles, 2) convectively cooling the airstream of the target particles, and 3) creating an adiabatic-expansion condition in the air volume surrounding the targeted particles (Vanhanen et al., 2011). The first two mechanisms have been implemented for virus aerosol sampling. For instance, Oh et al. (2010) compared a mixing type of bioaerosol amplification unit (mBAU) with a cooling type of bioaerosol amplification unit (cBAU), and observed that the mBAU performed better than the cBAU in collecting viable virus aerosol. The cooling type did not work well when using water vapor as condensation fluid because water's mass diffusivity is greater than air's thermal diffusivity (Hering & Stolzenburg, 2005). Thus, condensation mainly occurred on the cold wall surface rather than on aerosol particles. Hering, Spielman, and Lewis (2014) utilized a water-wetted hot wall instead of a cooling tube for the particle growth, and they demonstrated its capability to efficiently amplify nanosized aerosol (down to 6 nm) to sizes larger than 1 \u00b5m. High efficiency in collection of viable virus aerosol was further attempted on MS2 and H1N1 influenza virus using the same technique (Jiang et al., 2016, Lednicky et al., 2016, Pan et al., 2016, Pan et al., 2017).",

            "text": "The third approach, i.e., adiabatic expansion, includes an instant volume expansion whereby there is no heat transfer between the contained volume and its surroundings (Bailyn, 1994). For a system with a certain volume, the temperature, volume and pressure of the system before and after the adiabatic-expansion are related as follows:(1)P0V0\u03b3=PfVf\u03b3\n(2)T0V0\u03b3\u22121=TfVf\u03b3\u22121where P, V, T are pressure, volume and temperature, respectively, subscripts 0 and f refer to before and after adiabatic expansion, respectively, and \u03b3 is heat capacity ratio (i.e., the ratio of specific heat of relevant gas at a constant pressure over that at a constant volume, \u03b3=cpcv; Strey, Schmeling, & Wagner, 1986). Aitken (1888) implemented this principle to create supersaturation by lowering temperature of the surrounding air of target dust aerosol. Pollak and O'connor (1955) applied this principle in their photoelectric condensation nucleus counter (CNC), wherein a photoelectric sensor was used to count the number of enlarged mist particles. Pollak and Metnieks (1960) investigated the performance of the CNC under different volume expansion ratios (i.e., pfp0) and achieved a high saturation ratio of 3.50 under a compression ratio of 1.21, which exceeded the required Kelvin ratio for ultrafine particles (Miller & Bodhaine, 1982b). In their research, the CNC successfully amplified particles as small as 20 nm (Miller & Bodhaine, 1982a). Compared to the mixing and cooling approaches, the adiabatic expansion approach can result in an extremely high supersaturation ratio instantly, which activates the growth of particles in a very short time. This high supersaturation ratio played a key role in activating amplification of ultrafine particles as small as 13 nm (Liu et al., 1984). While there have been a handful of studies on size enlargement of particles using adiabatic expansion as discussed (e.g., the one by Okuyama et al., 1984), there is no study regarding size enlargement of viable virus aerosol by this approach yet.",

On this ground, a prototype of Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) sampler was designed and fabricated. Performance of the BASIC apparatus in regards to size amplification was evaluated. Since collection of viable virus aerosols was the main purpose for the new device, experiments were conducted to evaluate its ability in collecting viable viruses. To optimize the BASIC's operation, sensitivity analyses of key parameters were conducted, including compression pressure, number of compression/expansion cycles (C/E cycles), temperature of the condensing water and dwell time after the expansion.",

A certain amount of de-ionized (DI) water is placed inside the expansion bag as the source of volatile vapor for later condensation on the aerosol sample trapped inside the bag. DI water is chosen as the condensation fluid because of its non-toxicity comparing to other common-used condensation media, e.g. butanol, propylene glycol etc. (Agarwal and Sem, 1980, Kousaka et al., 1992).

First, compressed air was directed to a 6-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25; BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at a controlled flow rate of 6 Lpm to generate the aerosol flow. A diffusion dryer placed at the outlet of the nebulizer removed the water content of the aerosol. The target flow rate was established 15 min prior to each experiment. Before directing the aerosol into the bag, the aerosol inlet/outlet valve was open to let the expansion bag deflated. This process was realized by directing compressed air into the chamber through a compressor air valve, which was immediately closed after the bag was completely deflated. Then, the aerosol inlet/outlet valve was open to allow the sample aerosol flow into the expansion bag from the aerosol inlet port to fill the bag (Fig. 1a). Once the bag was fully filled, aerosol introduction was stopped (i.e. aerosol inlet/outlet valve closed) and compressed air was instead fed to the chamber to increase the chamber pressure. After reaching the targeted compression pressure, the air discharge valve was opened swiftly to quickly drop the chamber's pressure down to the atmospheric pressure level. Thus, the bag expanded instantly, and supersaturation condition was realized inside the expansion bag. This process enabled the particles contained inside the bag to be amplified by water vapor condensation as temperature rapidly decreased due to the swift pressure decrease.",

Amplified aerosol inside the expansion bag was discharged and directed to an Optical Particle Counter (OPC Model 1.108, Grimm\u00ae Technologies Inc., Douglasville, GA, USA; size range 0.3\u201320 \u00b5m) for measurements of total number concentration and count median diameter (CMD) of the supermicron particles (i.e., dp \u2265 1 \u00b5m). The CMD was determined using a log-probability plot of the measured size distribution for locating the corresponding diameter of 50% cut-off point of the accumulative number concentration (Hinds, 1999). Most commonly used bioaerosol samplers reach >90% collection efficiency only at supermicron size range. For example, the BioSampler does have 50% efficiency at 0.3 \u00b5m, but 90% efficiency is reached only above 0.8 \u00b5m. The AGI-30 impinger, which is also widely used for bioaerosol sampling, only has 90% efficiency at 1 \u00b5m (Lin et al., 2000). To properly assess the risks of bioaerosol exposure, high efficiency (90% or greater) is needed. This is the main rationale for using information of supermicron particles for further analysis. Control groups were also included by simply introducing the same sample aerosol into the expansion bag without application of any C/E cycle. Source aerosol was measured by introducing the aerosol flow from the outlet of the diffusion dryer into the OPC. One should note that the Collison nebulizer was the only source for generation of the aerosol and our rudimentary tests showed that application of the adiabatic expansion is not a mechanism for generation of the supermicron particles; it only grows submicron particles to supermicron particles by condensation following the cooling process induced by adiabatic expansion.",

While more C/E cycles were originally hypothesized to provide more water vapor for size amplification, the experimental results indicate that when the next cycle of compression was applied, work was done to the aerosol, causing re-evaporation of the water from the amplified aerosol in the bag.

However, the number concentration for supermicron particles decreased when the DI water temperature increased further to 60 \u00b0C. The results of One-way ANOVA test also confirm that the experiment run at 40 \u00b0C had the greatest size amplification potency for supermicron particles among these three temperatures. However, no obvious difference among the CMDs of these three groups is seen due to the large error bar of the group with 60 \u00b0C (Fig. 5b). The concentration of total particles at 60 \u00b0C was similar to that at 40 \u00b0C, while the CMD decreased. These may suggest that under higher temperature a wider size range of large droplets were produced. A higher temperature was expected to produce more supermicron particles as it would yield a higher moisture content available for condensation. The reason why the number concentration of supermicron particles decreased, when temperature increased to 60 \u00b0C, is not yet clear. One related theory is that at this higher temperature, the stability of virus capsid reduced, which might have led to the structure alteration of virion protein (a complete virus particle) (Pinto, Maillard, & Denyer, 2010). Meanwhile, impurities that were likely present in the lyophilized bacteriophage preparation could affect the particle size distribution as temperature varies.",

The figure shows an increasing trend of collected viable MS2 with an increase in the compression pressure up to 103.5 kPa. Shaking of amplified aerosol trapped inside the expansion bag increased the probability of amplified virus aerosol depositing into the DI water. The results indicate the viability was preserved in the investigated range of compression pressures (69.0 \u2013 138.0 kPa). Past studies showed that application of a high pressure on a virus-containing suspension can inactivate noroviruses (Aertsen, Meersman, Hendrickx, Vogel, & Michiels, 2009). However, this concern applies to an extremely high pressure (> 60,000 psi) wherein virus capsid protein or lipid envelope may be damaged (Tang et al., 2010). By using MS2 as a surrogate at a high pressure (40,000 psi), Pan (2015) observed that MS2 did not suffer significant viability loss under that pressure held for 3 min. Our statistical analysis results infer that the increased collection of viable MS2 after adiabatic expansion was significant compared to the case without adiabatic expansion; the collected amount increased as compression pressure increased up to 103.5 kPa, although there was no significant difference between cases with compression pressures of 103.5 kPa and of 138.0 kPa. Compared to the increase in the number concentration of supermicron particles when using 138.0 kPa vs. 69.0 kPa (Fig. 3a), the level of increase in collected viable MS2 virus was not as prominent. While the size amplification did increase the probability of particle collection, how MS2 was distributed in the amplified particles was unknown. In other words, the increase in the measured number concentration of the supermicron particles did not necessarily lead to a proportional increase of collected MS2 aerosol. Meanwhile, the difference might also imply some deactivation when using high compression pressure. Thus, caution should be taken at the higher compression pressure, and the distribution of viable MS2 in the amplified particles should be a subject of future investigation.",

In contrast to the physical size amplification, a higher number of cycles is inversely related to the viability preservation of MS2. As seen in Fig. 6b, the highest viable virus titer (4620 \u00b1 930 PFU/L air) was achieved at one C/E cycle, and the difference from other groups (3 cycles, 5 cycles, and no adiabatic expansion) was statistically significant. Pollard (1960) reported that gradual exertion of pressure on viruses leads to an increase of bond stability in virion protein, thus leading to the better stabilization of virus. However, exertion of an instant pressure loss (as in adiabatic expansion) may cause the breakage of the viruses. In other words, when the number of C/E cycles increases, viruses suffer from frequent and instant pressure changes, causing virions to expand and break apart. The other possible reason is the change in particle size distribution. However, Fig. 4a shows that the concentration and CMD of supermicron particles remained the same for different numbers of C/E cycles; thus, the low resistance to frequent pressure change is the more likely reason for the reduced viable MS2 collection. In summary, when using the BASIC for collection of viable MS2, one C/E cycle gives the optimal outcome.",

However, when the water temperature increased further to 60 \u00b0C, the titer of viable MS2 collected in water decreased greatly. Previous studies found that temperature can play a vital role in the viability of many viruses (Ausar, Foubert, Hudson, Vedvick, & Middaugh, 2006). Pinto et al. (2010) investigated the effect of temperature on MS2, and reported that high temperatures cause structural change of virion capsid and therefore virus inactivation. One-way ANOVA results confirm that by applying water temperature of 40 \u00b0C, the titer of collected viable MS2 was significantly higher than those at 25 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C. Different from other key parameters, higher water temperature exerts positive effect on physical size amplification but negative effect on viability preservation.
