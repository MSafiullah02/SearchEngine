Several factors, such as viral illnesses, upper respiratory infection, allergens, and air pollution, can disturb the homeostasis between host defenses and the pulmonary inflammation of patients with CF leading to a respiratory exacerbation. At least 35% of patients with CF present one or more episodes of respiratory exacerbation per year.23 Respiratory exacerbations are very harmful for patients with CF, associated with disease progression, decrease in quality of life, and increase in the risk of death.24, 25, 26\n",

Accordingly, Kamdar et al22 studied the effect of PM < 2.5 \u03bcm on cystic fibrosis epithelium by culturing IB3-1 and S-9 CF human bronchial epithelial cells. The authors demonstrated that PM induces oxidative stress by mediating apoptosis in the CF bronchial epithelium. They suggested that the intense inflammatory response and the impaired mitochondrial function caused by the pollutant have a critical role in inducing cytotoxic effects in the airway epithelium of patients with CF. These processes could probably favor the occurrence of an acute respiratory exacerbation.",

The authors evaluated 11,484 patients > 6 years of age enrolled in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry in 1999 and 2000. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of two or more pulmonary exacerbations compared with one or zero exacerbations. Increases of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in the PM10 and O3 annual averages were associated, respectively, with increases of 9% (95% CI, 2%-17%) and 10% (95% CI, 3%-17%) of the odds of having two exacerbations. Adjusting for PM10 and additional confounders, a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in O3 was associated with an increase of 1.08 (95% CI, 1.01-1.15) in the OR for pulmonary exacerbations. In our study, when we performed the analysis with an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in the ozone concentration, we observed, using a longitudinal repeated-measures design, a risk of pulmonary exacerbation (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.27) similar to the one found by Goss and colleagues.30\n",

Interestingly, O3 is a strong oxidizing compound that causes damage to the lungs and promotes airway inflammation. The interaction between ozone and lung epithelial lining fluid in patients with CF most likely produces oxidized species that may be responsible for triggering lung inflammation and contribute to acute bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness, similar to the changes observed in asthma.37, 38 Furthermore, ozone is able to induce apoptosis, DNA damage, and cytotoxicity on human type 1 alveolar epithelial cells and ciliated airway epithelial cells, which can worsen airway inflammation in patients with CF.39, 40 These processes could be an effect of O3 itself, given its high oxidative capacity, or a collective effect of all pollutants that can be found in the photochemical mixture of air pollution, which is not regularly measured by environmental agencies. The effect observed in two-pollutant or multipollutant models may be a consequence of the high correlation between O3 and primary pollutants. It is quite plausible to assume the effects on respiratory exacerbation as the result of the action of all pollutants.",
