One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvant's effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 \u00b5g/mL) of the adjuvants for 24h or 72h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.

We hypothesized that irrespective of adjuvant composition, or tissue derivation of cells, ABAs dose-dependently would cause the same degree of necrosis that then leads to proinflammatory cytokine release.

After 24h, there was pronounced cytotoxicity observed only after exposure to Adju-Phos and this may be related to the larger size of the particles. This is in agreement with a study showing that in THP-1 cells, Adju-Phos displayed much greater cytotoxicity compared to Alhydrogel (Mold et al., 2016) . Neither alum nor Imject (neither of which are used clinically) caused decrease in cell viability in the macrophages. The degree to which this finding might influence the effectiveness of Imject as an adjuvant should be further investigated. Both Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos caused a pronounced loss of cell viability in macrophages derived from THP-1 cells after a 72h exposure. No clear relationship between particle size and toxicity was observed at this later time point, and thus additional physicochemical properties may contribute to loss of cell viability. Cell viability in astrocytes was also decreased to the same extent after exposure to either Alhydrogel or Adju-Phos after 24h. Comparing exposure to the two clinically relevant ABAs, the loss of viability in astrocytes after 72h was more pronounced after exposure to Adju-Phos, especially at the lower concentrations. Overall, susceptibility of astrocytes did not appear to be dose-dependent as the lower concentrations of Adju-Phos (10 & 20 \u00b5g/mL) were just as capable of reducing viability as the larger doses (50 & 100 \u00b5g/mL). After the 72h exposure, both Alhydrogel and Adju-phos caused enhancement of ROS formation (especially at the higher doses tested) in both THP-1 derived macrophages and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f astrocytes. However, an enhancement of general ROS formation was not observed at the 24h time point in the astrocytes. Thus the loss of viability does not appear to be associated with oxidative stress, but the cell death appears to contribute to subsequent enhancement of oxidative events as judged by an increase in general ROS formation.",

Macrophages exposed to all three of the aluminum adjuvants show a dosedependent increase in TNF-\u03b1. On the other hand, astrocytes exposed to the ABAs released significant amounts of IL-6 in a nonmonotonic dose response pattern. We have previously reported that exposure to aluminum sulfate (500\u00b5M) for 48h resulted in upregulation of oxidative events in glioma but not neuroblastoma cells (Campbell et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 1999), indicating that depending on the type of brain-derived cell evaluated, aluminum may cause a specific response. After a 6d exposure to the same concentration of aluminum sulfate, we observed that a human glioblastoma cell line released TNF-\u03b1 but not IL-6 in response to the Al salt . Thus the glioblastoma cell line appears to have a cytokine response resembling that of macrophages rather than that of primary human astrocytes. Cytokine release in response to aluminum salts may underlie the immunomodulatory role of aluminum adjuvants and may be closely related to the characteristics and function of the type of cell evaluated. To what degree these differences in cytokine profile may dictate the safety and efficacy of ABAs needs to be further investigated.",

Astrocytes: After a 24h exposure, there was generally a decline in ROS formation after treatment with Imject, alum, or Adju-Phos. Exposure to Alhydrogel caused no such depression. At the longer 72h time point, exposure to Alhydrogel (50 \u00b5g/mL & 100 \u00b5g/mL) or Adju-Phos (all concentrations), resulted in a consistent increase in ROS formation. This was concurrent with and perhaps causal to the decreased cell viability observed at this time point. There was an increase in ROS formation only at the 20 \u00b5g/mL exposure to Imject implying an overall lower level of toxicity of this adjuvant (Figure 4).",

Aluminum hydroxide gel (Alhydrogel) is crystalline, but the degree of the structure is based on manufacturing setting and composition of the buffers in which it is diluted. Aluminum phosphate gel (Adju-Phos) is non-crystalline due to disruption of the crystallization process by phosphate(HogenEsch et al., 2018).Because the composition of the media may have influenced the size of the aluminum particles, we evaluated the effective diameter of the aluminum adjuvants in both astrocyte and macrophage media for 24h & 72h. Incubation of alhydrogel in both astrocyte and macrophage medium for 24h resulted in formation of particles in the 1048 -1198 nm range at both concentrations tested. Adju-phos particles were larger (2114 -3810 nm) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and this was concentration-dependent mainly in the macrophage medium. Imject particles were approximately 1288 -1394 nm in diameter while alum particles were the smallest (range of 422 -844 nm) particularly in the macrophage medium assessed. With increasing incubation time (72h), the size of the aluminum particles did not significantly alter.",
