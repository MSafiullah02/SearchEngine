            "text": "Most viruses initiate infection of susceptible cells by first attaching to specific cell surface receptors. Receptors have been identified for many animal, insect, and bacterial viruses, and only plant viruses seem to pose an exception. In animal viruses, the receptor determines, in part, host range and tissue tropism. Viruses are able to subvert a wide variety of cell-surface molecules as receptors. Some viruses are able to recognize very specific proteins, whereas others use sugar moieties or common chemical groups for attachment. Many viral receptors act simply as molecular tethers that concentrate virus particles on the cell surface and direct them towards disassembly pathways. For some viruses, however, the cell receptor plays an active role in the uncoating of the viral genome, that is the translocation of the RNA from the interior of the capsid to the host cell cytoplasm.",

Ninety percent, the major group, utilize the cell surface glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as receptor (Greve et al., 1989; Staunton et al., 1989). A minor group of about 10 HRV serotypes uses members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family for cell binding (Hofer et al., 1994; Marlovits et al., 1998), and one individual serotype, HRV87, binds to a still uncharacterized receptor (Uncapher et al., 1991). ICAM-1 is also shared as receptor by several members of the Coxsackievirus-A family, another group of picornaviruses causing upper respiratory infections (Colonno et al., 1986; Shafren et al., 1997).",

Hypervariable surface residues coincide with the binding sites of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and mutations at these sites allow the virus to escape the neutralization effect. On the basis of these residue conservation patterns, the canyon was proposed as the receptor binding site (Rossmann et al., 1985; Rossmann, 1989). It was also suggested that HRVs could hide their receptor binding site inside canyons or depressions, inaccessible to bulkier antibodies, while mutating the external residues outside the canyon to elude the host's immune surveillance. These postulates form the basis of what became known as the canyon hypothesis (Rossmann, 1989). Confirmation of the canyon as receptor binding site was provided by mutational analysis of specific residues in the canyon (Colonno et al., 1988), and by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a complex of HRV16 with a two-domain fragment of ICAM-1 (Olson et al., 1993).",

It permits antigen-independent adhesion between lymphocytes and their targets, and has a major role in leukocyte transmigration from the blood to the tissues in inflammatory sites (van de Stolpe and van der Saag, 1996). Two membrane-bound integrin receptors, leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1), and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) are the normal ligands for ICAM-1. Binding sites for these receptors have been identified by mutagenesis techniques and competition experiments in domains D1 and D3, respectively (Fig. 1). ICAM-1 also serves as a receptor for soluble fibrinogen, its binding site still controversial, as well as for the extracellular matrix factor hyaluronan (van de Stolpe and van der Saag, 1996). These interactions probably mediate leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium. The cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1 interacts with the cytoskeleton-binding protein \u03b1-actinin (Carp\u00e9n et al., 1992), determining cell surface distribution of ICAM-1 and recruitment to points of interaction with other cells.",

Major group rhinoviruses and A-type coxsackieviruses use ICAM-1 to release their RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. Erythrocytes infected by the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, are able to bind ICAM-1 in the surface of endothelial cells (Berendt et al., 1992; Ockenhouse et al., 1992), and use this cytoadherence to sequester themselves in deep vascular beds, including the brain, minimizing exposure of the parasite to immune surveillance. Finally, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), uses ICAM-1 as a coreceptor (Bastiani et al., 1997; Fortin et al., 1997; Rizzuto and Sodroski, 1997). HIV-1 acquires several host cell membrane proteins when it buds from infected cells, making it possible for ICAM-1 to be incorporated into the envelope of the virions. This results in an increase of subsequent virus\u2013cell interactions, enhancement of virus infectivity, and extension of the host cell range.",

The structure of the two amino-terminal domains of ICAM-1 (D1D2) has been determined recently by X-ray crystallography (Bella et al., 1998; Casasnovas et al., 1998). As expected, each domain adopts an Ig fold. Binding sites on domain D1 can be mapped on the crystal structure (Fig. 2\n). Residues identified by mutational analysis as important for HRV binding belong to the three loops DE, BC, and FG, located at the very tip of domain D1. The interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 probably requires a broad surface centered around Glu34, a residue crucial for binding located in strand C. By analogy, domain D1 could be described as a hand with three stretched fingers and a folded thumb. The tips of the three fingers (loops DE, BC, and FG) would be responsible for recognition and binding to the major group of rhinoviruses, whereas the folded thumb would be the LFA-1 recognition site. Residues important for binding ICAM-1 to malarial-infected erythrocytes map to strand B and loop CD, defining another interacting surface that differs in location from both rhinovirus and LFA-1 binding sites.",

Infectious virions are thought to uncoat through intermediate particles characterized by the loss of VP4 and the externalization of the hydrophobic N-termini of VP1, which in turns makes the capsid hydrophobic. Intermediate particles further evolve into empty particles by release of RNA. Empty particles and most intermediate particles are noninfective, abortive products, and only a small fraction of intermediate particles attaches to the membrane and delivers the viral RNA into the cytoplasm (Rueckert, 1996).",

That problem can be solved by comparing EM reconstructions from complexes of HRV16 with ICAM-1 D1D2 fragments with different degrees of glycosylation. The second domain of ICAM-1 has four N-linked carbohydrates (Fig. 1), three of which have been removed in a genetically engineered version of ICAM-1 D1D2 with reduced glycosylation (Bella et al., 1998). The reconstruction of the complex between HRV16 and this modified ICAM-1 D1D2 (Fig. 3), can be subtracted from the reconstruction between HRV16 and intact, fully glycosylated ICAM-1 D1D2 (Olson et al., 1993). The resulting difference map identifies the positions of the glycosylation sites as \u201clumps\u201d on the surface of the density corresponding to the D2 domain, and allows to remove the orientation ambiguity (Fig. 4\n). Carbohydrates are intrinsically flexible molecules and can adopt a myriad of different conformations. This inherent disorder results in only the first two or three sugars from each glycosylation site being visible in crystal structures of glycoproteins, including ICAM-1 D1D2. Analogously, the lumps observed in the EM reconstructions only cover these few sugars that are closer to the protein, and therefore more ordered.",

Nevertheless, there is experimental evidence that the presence of antiviral compounds in the hydrophobic pocket affects cell binding for many of the major group HRVs. A two-step mechanism for the binding of ICAM-1 to HRVs can reconcile these conflicting observations. In a first step, complexes between HRVs and ICAM-1 form in a reversible manner, as they can be observed in cryo-EM reconstructions. The second step involves a displacement of the receptor attached to the virus plus a conformational change on the virus surface, resulting in a tighter, higher affinity binding between ICAM-1 and HRVs. This second step could result from conformational changes in VP1 in which the region around the hydrophobic pocket would act as a hinge (Fig. 5\n). Such movement would induce a destabilization in the virus capsid and perhaps the opening of a channel in the five-fold vertex through which externalization of VP4, the N-terminus of VP1, and eventually RNA could occur (Kolatkar et al., 1999). In this way, interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs would initiate uncoating of the viral RNA.",

The presence of an antiviral compound in the pocket would impart rigidity to the hinge region and prevent the second step to occur. As a consequence uncoating would be inhibited. Conversely, empty pockets would impart conformational flexibility to the hinge region, and ultimately allow movement of polypeptide chains during the uncoating process. Crystal structures of HRVs show uncharacterized pocket molecules, probably lipidic in nature, filling the hydrophobic pocket in a manner similar to the antiviral compounds in HRV14 (Smith et al., 1986; Kim et al., 1989; Oliveira et al., 1993). It has been suggested that pocket-binding antiviral drugs displace such \u201cpocket factors\u201d, and that competition between pocket factors and receptors regulates the viral stability (Rossmann, 1994). For example, ICAM-1 would be able to eject a weakly bound pocket molecule during the second step of the mechanism shown in Fig. 5, thus emptying the hydrophobic pocket and initiating uncoating. In contrast, a tightly bound antiviral compound would not be removed.",

Initial contact between the virus and receptor occurs mostly through capsid residues in the canyon and four loops at the tip of domain D1 of ICAM-1, at the end distal from the membrane. This interaction appears to have an important electrostatic component. High-affinity binding probably requires a second step in which other areas of the viral surface and the receptor may come into contact. This second step probably weakens the interactions between the capsid protomers and triggers the uncoating mechanism, perhaps through channels opened in the icosahedral five-fold axes. Capsid-binding antiviral compounds can effectively block the uncoating process by imparting rigidity to the viral capsid and preventing the high affinity binding step between ICAM-1 and HRVs. Many details need still to be addressed, and parallels sought with other picornavirus\u2013receptor interactions. Lacking crystallographic resolution images of the virus\u2013receptor complexes, cryo-EM reconstructions assisted with fitting of molecular models of the individual components will prove very valuable to demonstrate precisely how the virus and receptor interact, and to provide clues about the sequence of events that goes from initial cell surface attachment to release of the RNA into the host cell cytoplasm.",
