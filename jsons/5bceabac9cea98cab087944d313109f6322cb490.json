Phylogenetic analysis based on open reading frames (ORFs) 1 and 2 revealed that these recombinants were related to stains of different genotypes from different countries. The full genome nucleotide sequences of the two isolates were 97.0% and 98.0% identical to those of strains from London and Thailand, respectively. Simplot analysis revealed the presence of a break point at nt 5059 in the ORF1 region. The histo-blood group antigen binding sites were conserved in both recombinant viruses. Our findings not only provide valuable genetic information about a recombinant norovirus but also contribute to our general understanding of the evolution, genetic diversity, and distribution of noroviruses.",

            "text": "Noroviruses are a major causative agent of acute gastroenteritis, with high prevalence across the globe [1] . Norovirus outbreaks in public spaces, such as kindergartens and primary or secondary schools, are generally associated with low hygiene levels and contaminated food or water [2] [3] [4] . Noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae and have three open reading frames (ORFs) in their genome. ORF1 encodes a large nonstructural protein (Ntpase, p22, VPg, 3CLpro and RdRp), ORF2 encodes the major structural capsid protein (VP1), and ORF3 encodes a minor structural protein (VP2) [5] . Based on the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein, noroviruses have been classified into 10 genogroups (GI~GX) and approximately 53 genotypes so far [6, 7] . Of the genogroups, GI, GII and GIV can be found in human infections, with genogroup GII being the most common [8] . The GII. 4 [P4] genotype has been reported in many countries and is the prevalent strain in most outbreaks and human infections [9] [10] [11] . Previous reports have shown that GII. 17 [P17] became the main epidemic genotype of norovirus in China, in 2014 [11] [12] [13] [14] . GII. 21 [P21] and GII. 13 [P13] have also been found in the coastal environment and in seafood in Korea. These two genotypes share a close phylogenetic relationship with GII.17 [P17] . However, these genotypes are found infrequently in human infections, and this might be associated with a unique histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding site involved in host susceptibility and the presence of decoy glycan receptors in the human gastrointestinal tract that prevents binding of the virus [15, 16] .",

Here, we report two GII. 13 [P21] recombinant strains from an outbreak in the city of Changsha. In this outbreak, there were also two cases of coinfection with GI and GII.

The ORF1 and ORF2 junction was amplified from six samples by RT-PCR and sequenced, and the following genotypes were found: GII. 13 To investigate the genetic relationship between the recombinants and other sequences available in the GenBank database, full-genome sequences and ORF1-2 fragments of strains were analyzed by constructing a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A) . A phylogenetic tree based on a fragment of the RdRp gene revealed that the recombinant strains belonged to the same branch as viruses from the United Kingdom (MH218651) and Bhutan (MH702263) and shared 98.4%-98.5% sequence identity with MH702263 ( Fig. 2A) .

Whole-genome sequencing of recombinant strains is important for vaccine development strategies and studies of viral evolution. Hence, we determined the genome sequences of GII.13[P21] recombinant strains isolated in the city of Changsha, China. From the epidemiological information, although only visitors of the commercial park suffered from gastroenteritis, all food and water samples from the park were free of contamination, indicating that the source of the contamination might have been direct contact with infected persons or contaminated environments. Based on the genetic and sequence data, we conclude that the outbreak involved multiple genotypes, including GII.4[P4], GII.2[P16], and GII.17 [P17] , which have been reported frequently in previous outbreaks [10] . These results reveal that the prevalent genotypes continue to infect humans. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1 and ORF2 segments showed that the recombinant strains belong to different branches. These results suggest that sequences in these recombinant strains might have originated in other countries neighboring China or that the strains might have evolved from local strains that have not been detected in the environment before.

The break point identified in this study was located in ORF1 segment, at the same position as reported previously in other recombinant strains [23] .

Owing to the high frequency of genetic exchange at the ORF1 and ORF2 junction, multiple recombinant strains have emerged and caused outbreaks, such as GII.4[P31] and GII.2[P16] [19, 27, 28]. Previous studies have shown that GII.17[P17] was the most prevalent genotype in 2014 in China [11, 13]. Genotypes GII.17[P17], GII.13[P13], and GII.21[P21] belong to a separate genetic lineage in the phylogenetic tree[29, 30]. Unlike GII.4[P4] and GII.2[P16], which have caused large outbreaks and infections around the world, human infections with genotypes GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] have rarely been reported. Differences in the HBGA binding sites of GII.21[P21] and GII.13[P13] variants might contribute to the sporadic rate of infection",
