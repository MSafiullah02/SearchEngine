            "text": "Airborne transmission of viruses, such as the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in hospital systems are under debate: it has been shown that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus goes beyond droplet dynamics that is limited to 3-6 feet, but it is unclear if the airborne viral load is significant enough to ensure transmission of the disease. Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff's health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.",

In the unfortunate case an elective surgery is practiced on an asymptomatic COVID- 19 patient and who was not tested positive, one may ask if the virus can escape an Operating Room (OR) kept under positive pressure and expose staff in peripheral area to the disease. This question is particularly important to healthcare staff who spend multiple long hour shifts in a hospital system that manages COVID-19 patients. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation emitted from the surgical table area.",

This methodology addresses only the physical side of the problem and therefore does not answer the effectiveness of airborne particles to induce COVID-19. Some of the difficulties encountered in such studies are that air sampling and infection may or may not be strongly correlated [14, 15] . However, it is an important step to quantify the level of exposure in order to estimate the corresponding viral load in part. Transport and diffusion mechanisms are very effective for UFP to travel a long distance from the source in a short period of time. A 2020 report from China demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 virus particles could be found in the ventilation systems in restaurants [16] and in hospital rooms of patients with COVID-19 underlining how viable virus particles can travel long distances from patients [17] .",

The unit used for the source of the emission is 0.01 particles per cubic foot; it gives the measurements an order of magnitude from ten to thousands by which they can be compared. Small particles are found in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 microns, which are the sizes of biologicalmaterial particles like viruses. As opposed to the results reported in Weld et Al [31] , our off-the-shelf particle sensor does not give us access to the UFP count. A conservative estimate from Weld et Al [31] results would be that the concentration number of UFP is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than what is measured for the small particles. In Table 1 , each source's mean, standard deviation, and diffusion coefficient are reported -more precisely \u03b1 is the rate at which the pollutant concentration decreases, which is obtained from fitting a simple exponential decay model Source exp \u2212\u03b1t to the experimental data. There was no significant statistical difference between the rates of diffusion of the particles emitted by the monopolar versus the APC instruments. The coefficient of diffusion corresponding to the harmonic instrument is lower but has strong variation. We interpret this result with the fact that some of the particles emitted in this case were too small, 0.06 microns, to be detected by our sensors [31] . As mentioned earlier, covering the sensor with a surgical facemask dropped the number of large particles to some extent, but there are always leaks on the sides. As noticed in the literature standard, surgical facemasks do not protect from UFP.",

In the unfortunate event that the door of the next OR is opened, then some trace of the surgical smoke emitted by the OR upstream, can flow inside the next OR down the hall; while the level of exposure to surgical smoke would be insignificant in this second OR, it is clear that the standard positive pressure established in these ORs cannot guarantee those airborne particles do not propagate from one OR to another. Over a period of several months, this rare event might be capable of propagating an airborne disease. In fact, the frequency of door openings of each OR can be very high, as shown in Figure 14 , that the probability of propagating airborne diseases and contaminating other ORs seems inevitable.

These peaks were removed from the OR acquisition curve that corresponds to the use of detergent. Similarly, during the preparation and closing of the patient, the sensor sometimes captured the use of chemicals when preparing the sterile field or the leak of anesthetic gas. The red peak during the third procedure in Figure 7 most likely corresponds to an excess of surgical smoke. As expected, the concentration of particles in the hall is not strictly correlated to the emission of surgical smoke in the OR. The hallway collects pollutants from a number of ORs under positive pressure at the same time. Because of this, it is difficult to separate out surgical smoke from other sources in the hallway measurement, such as chemicals used in the preparation of patients located in ORs upstream.

This system is part of a standard OR suite and represents one half of the facility in Figure 13 that has an architectural design almost symmetric with its two circulation side-halls. Computing the concentration of a so-called \"marker,\" which can be a specific gas or set of airborne particles in the air of this OR suite, is particularly of interest. This marker is generated from the location of the OR's surgical table, where a surgeon is using an electrosurgical instrument that produces smoke from the thermal destruction of tissues. The marker can also be the particles resulting from evaporation of any alcohol-based chemical used either to prep the patient or to clean the OR. The model has two parts: first, a compartment-like model that can monitor the indoor pollution [40]; second, a multi-scale ABM that simulates the surgical flow activity and the impact on the indoor air quality either from the source of surgical smoke or from door openings affecting the dispersion of pollutants [30] . Staff movement throughout the OR suite via door openings and closings will manifestly be a key mechanism for propagation of markers. The indoor air quality is a linear set of differential equations that will be slightly more complex than a standard compartment model since the coefficient will be stochastic, the sources and output/leaks of the particles term will have a time delay built in, and the hallway will require a transport equation.",

Three types of energy delivery systems were compared: electrosurgery (conduction) via the Covidien ForceTriad monopolar device, ultrasonic (mechanic) with the Ethicon Harmonic Scalpel P06674 device, and laser tissue ablation with Erbe APC (Argon Plasma Coagulation) 2 device. To keep the tissue burn superficial, a pattern of parallel lines was followed with each device and always used unburned areas of the meat. The energy was delivered for a period of 30s up to 60s in order to produce a large quantity of smoke and thus particles. The measurement was done by several laser particle counters from Dylos Corp placed at various distances from the source (http://www.dylosproducts.com/dc1700.html). They give an average particle count every minute in a unit system with units u d that correspond to 0.01 particles per cubic foot. A traditional problem with the validation of particle count in laboratory conditions is that particles are not all the same uniform size. According to smartAir (http://smartairfilters.com/cn/en/), the Dylos system output is highly correlated (r = 0.8) to a \"ground true\" measurement provided by a high-end system such as the Sibata LD 6S that is claimed to be accurate within 10% in controlled laboratory conditions. According to smartAir, the Dylos system seems particularly accurate at the lower concentration ends, which is of interest for this study's purpose. Semple et al. [41] also compared the Dylos system with a more expensive system: the Sidepak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitors (TSI, Minnesota, USA). They concluded that the Dylos' output agrees closely with the one produced by the Sidepak instrument with a mean difference of 0.09 \u00b5g/m 3 .",

The model classifies the human factors impact and limitation of shared resources on flow efficiency. In the end, communication delays and sub-optimal OR awareness in large surgical suites have significant impacts on performance and should be addressed. This paper concentrates on the duration of surgery State 3 that corresponds to how long surgical smoke is generated, and how behavior inducing OR door openings are responsible in part for the spread of surgical smoke and other agents. The output of the ABM model of surgical flow coupled to the air quality model is the number of hours per year that staff gets exposed to surgical smoke in the OR and hallway. Various scenarios have been run related to the rate of adoption of vacuum systems for surgical smoke and OR door openings to discuss the influence of human behavior on those results.",

Long et al. showed in a new meta-analysis that there was no significant difference in effectiveness between surgical masks and N95 masks against laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections[12] especially at higher inhalation flow rate[13]. Seongman et al. also showed that for viruses, effectiveness of surgical mask (and cotton based masks in the paper) are dependent to virus concentration and flow rate of inhalation but also showed a higher concentration of viral load on the outside of the mask compared to the inside[39]. Being able to know where these particles are and in what concentration seem then the best protection and awareness for staff to avoid staying too long in contact. Deposition rate of these particles is not addressed in this paper and researchers are still debating about lifetime on surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

The Facility Management Service (FMS) of the hospital was able to supply the values of volume per minute that the inlets are blowing (1.15 m 3 /s) and of the volume going through the outlets (0.55 m 3 /s). As the surface of the outlets is known, the velocity of the outlet vents were 0.5 m/s for the left one and 0.4 m/s for the right one, reported on Figure 1. The volume of extra air in the OR is the difference: 1.15 \u2212 0.55 = 0.6 m 3 /s. Due to the positive pressure of 8 Pa present in the OR, this additional volume leaks out of the OR through either the door being left open or the narrow gap around the door when it is closed. In that case, the free boundary surface was estimated to be 8.5 cm 2 .",
