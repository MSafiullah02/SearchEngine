In India, The Government of India had requested the people of India to observe a one day \"Janata Curfew\" (which was a mini lockdown of 14 hours) on March 22nd, 2020 (The Economic Times, 2020). People were requested to appreciate the efforts of those working round the clock (health professionals, police department, media people, etc.), by clapping or by banging any utensils at home with a spoon at ones' doorstep or in the balcony to express solidarity at 5 pm sharp on that day for 5 minutes. This activity was a huge success, and the majority of the Indians expressed their solidarity wholeheartedly.",

Implementing complete lockdown was an arduous task keeping in mind the collectivistic nature of Indians and low individualism compared to other western countries. Seeing the need to keep the Indians feel positive, the Prime Minister proposed one more task for April 5th, 2020 (Sunday), nearly on the 10 th day of the lockdown. The task was to switch off lights at home at 9 pm for 9 minutes and light a lamp or candle or torch or mobile phone flashlight in their respective doorstep or balconies to fight darkness and make a statement that no one is alone in this fight against the COVID 19 pandemic. All over India, the majority of the people switched off their lights and followed the task instructions expressing solidarity with the government and each other. Many people took to social media platforms to appreciate the activity and mentioned the emotions that they went through before-during-and after the task. This paper is an attempt to study the sentiments of Indians during the above task. We used the social media platform Twitter for our analysis. Using the following four hashtags, we extracted 24998 tweets related to the task from April 5th, 2020 to April 6th, 2020: #9pm9minute; #AaoPhirSeDiyaJalayen; #LightofHope; and # April 5th. We analyzed the tweets using the software R and generated a word cloud and a graphical representation of the emotions in the tweets. with each other and performed the lighting task, which not only lit everyone's morale and boosted it but also was a welcome change from the monotonous, no thrill routine during the lockdown. Another emotion that stood out in the tweets was trust, indicating that people had immense faith that they would come out of the current situation stronger, sooner or later.",

The World Health Organisation has declared COVID 19 as a Pandemic (World Health Organisation, 2020). With almost all the countries affected by this virus, most of the countries have already announced a complete lockdown to curb the spread of this virus further and are strictly suggesting social distancing. The lockdown related to COVID 19 is taking its toll on people both mentally and physically. There are a few academic studies that have tried to explore this angle (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; and Yang et al., 2020). During such times, where emotional balance can go for a toss, parent and peer relationships can matter a lot (McMahon et al., 2020). Further, there is a high chance of people developing psychological stress and disorders like depression, insomnia, anxiety, anger, boredom, etc. (Brooks et al., 2020).",
