            "text": "Intact, enveloped coronavirus particles vary widely in size and contour, and are thus refractory to study by traditional structural means such as X-ray crystallography. Electron microscopy (EM) overcomes some problems associated with particle variability and has been an important tool for investigating coronavirus ultrastructure. However, EM sample preparation requires that the specimen be dried onto a carbon support film before imaging, collapsing internal particle structure in the case of coronaviruses. Moreover, conventional EM achieves image contrast by immersing the specimen briefly in heavy-metal-containing stain, which reveals some features while obscuring others. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) instead employs a porous support film, to which the specimen is adsorbed and flashfrozen. Specimens preserved in vitreous ice over holes in the support film can then be imaged without additional staining. Cryo-EM, coupled with single-particle image analysis techniques, makes it possible to examine the size, structure and arrangement of coronavirus structural components in fully hydrated, native virions. Two virus purification procedures are described.",

This requires at minimum C Humana Press, New York, NY 12, a 100-fold concentration step, since coronavirus growth seldom surpasses 10 8 PFU/ml. Moreover, the coronavirus envelope and the protein-mediated connections between the membrane and the ribonucleoprotein are sensitive to mechanical and osmotic disruption. The viral spike proteins (S) are sensitive to ectodomain shearing and, if cleaved, to shedding of the amino-terminal S1 subunit. The method of concentration and purification described here is designed to minimize these disruptive forces and has been used successfully with several coronaviruses and other enveloped viruses.",

This method is suitable for most coronaviruses that grow well in cultured cells and has been used successfully with SARS-CoV, FcoV, and MHV (1) in addition to several types of arenavirus (B. N., unpublished data). For the purpose of this protocol, it is assumed that SARS-CoV is being prepared on Vero-E6 cells. 2. Culture Vero-E6 cells in DMEM to approximately 70-90% confluency (see Note 1). 3. Inoculate with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of approximately 3 PFU/cell. 4. Remove the inoculum after 1 h and replace it with fresh medium. 5. Remove and discard the culture medium 24 h after inoculation. Replace it with fresh DMEM (see Note 2). 6. Collect the cell culture supernatant 48 h after inoculation. Store a small sample for plaque assay titration (see Note 3). 7. Transfer the supernatant to centrifuge bottles with screw caps, noting the total volume. Pellet cellular debris at 10,000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u2022 C for 20 min. It is best to use a high-capacity rotor at this stage to minimize preparation time. 8. During the centrifugation, prepare fresh screw-cap centrifuge bottles containing 10 g of dry PEG-8000 and 2.2 g of NaCl per 100 ml of culture medium to be added. Alternatively, prepare a large conical flask with sufficient PEG-8000 and NaCl to bring the entire volume of virus-containing medium to a final concentration of 10% PEG-8000, 2.2% NaCl. Chill HEPES-saline and neutral-buffered formalin on ice for later use (see Note 4). 9. After centrifugation (step 6), an off-white or yellow pellet of cell debris will be visible. Decant the supernatant into the centrifuge bottles or conical flask prepared earlier with PEG and NaCl. 10. Swirl the mixture gently until the additives are fully dissolved. Add a clean stir bar and incubate at 4 \u2022 C for a further 30 min with gentle stirring. 11. Transfer the solution to centrifuge bottles, if you have not done so already Collect the PEG-precipitated protein fraction by centrifugation for 30 min at approximately 10,000 \u00d7 g. 12. During the centrifugation, prepare three-step 10% -20% -30% sucrose gradients in tubes appropriate to the high-speed centrifuge rotor. If using the Beckman SW-28 rotor, use \u223c8 ml for each step, leaving \u223c10 ml for sample loading and balancing (see Note 5). 13. Decant and discard supernatants immediately to minimize sample loss. A large opaque white pellet should be present in each of the flasks following centrifugation. Swirl the pellet in cold HEPES-saline until dissolved. Avoid using a pipette at this step, if possible. It is critical that the PEG pellets be completely resuspended before proceeding to the next step (see Note 6).",

Resuspend the virion pellet in as small a volume of HEPES-saline as possible (typically 100-200 l). Do not use a pipette to resuspend the virus, as this may shear spikes and damage fragile viral envelopes (see Note 7). 16.

Assuming an average SARS-CoV titer of \u223c10 7 PFU/ml, 1 liter or more of infectious cell culture medium will be needed. One-well plates (available from Nalgene) can be a cost-and space-effective alternative to standard tissue culture flasks for large-scale virus preparation. 2. Early time points containing little virus can be discarded. Purification efficiency is strongly dependent on concentration. 3. Virus can be collected at 2-h intervals beginning 48 h after inoculation to increase the final yield. However, for best results, each virus sample should be processed immediately, rather than collected and stored. 4. For viruses with cleaved spike proteins, such as MHV, the amount of NaCl added should be reduced to 1 g/100 ml to minimize damage to the spikes. 5. Alternatively, virus can be banded at the interface of a 30-50% two-step sucrose gradient. 6. In general, rapid resuspension, cold temperature, and the minimization of mechanical stress will all improve the quality of the preparation. Soluble proteins contained in the pellet may alter the color to a yellowish hue. 7. The translucent virion pellet may be difficult to see. Whether or not the pellet is visible, attempt to resuspend immediately. If a pellet is present, the viscosity of the added HEPES-saline will increase noticeably upon resuspension. 8. Inactivation techniques should be validated beforehand. Both formaldehyde and 2-propiolactone can lose effectiveness over time. Tris buffers will react with formaldehyde, and should be avoided. HEPES buffer is therefore recommended for use throughout the purification process. 9. The growth of SARS-CoV, FcoV, and MHV is not affected by short-term treatment with VP-SFM as outlined here. However, cells do grow more slowly in VP-SFM as compared to DMEM, and thus VP-SFM is not recommended for the initial cell culture step. 10. If left in contact with the supernatant, serum-free PEG pellets will resuspended much more quickly than serum-containing pellets, and the sample may be lost. 11. Grids that continually sink in the saline or stain droplets likely have suffered extensive damage to the support surface and should not be used. 12. The purpose of glow discharge treatment is to impart a charge to the carboncoated side of the grid, which can otherwise be quite hydrophobic. Therefore, glow discharge grids with the carbon side, which will appear slightly dull, facing upward. 13. The effects of the electron beam on large amounts of residual stain can cause a \"blowout\" of the carbon/formvar support surface. It is therefore important to remove all excess stain before visualization. 14. The vitrified ice supporting the specimen must be very thin (\u223c1 m or less) to permit clear imaging. 15. Sample blotting is unfortunately an inexact process. The thickness of the sample ice can be adjusted by altering blotting time, which typically ranges from 0.5 to about 15 sec. Ice thickness and quality will have to be assessed by EM (Fig. 1) , so it is recommended that several grids be prepared at once using different blot times.",
