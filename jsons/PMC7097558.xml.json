The underlying mechanism for this is thought to be the extensive and rapid variation of important surface antigens\u2014such as adhesive pili, lipooligosaccharides and the so-called opacity proteins (Opas)\u2014which result in immunoevasion. However, gonorrhea is also believed to predispose individuals to HIV-1 and chlamydia infection, which suggests that gonococci might down-regulate local specific immune responses in a more direct manner. In this issue of Nature Immunology, Boulton and Gray-Owen show that gonococci\u2014which bind carcinoembryonic antigen\u2013related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) on CD4+ T cells\u2014can down-regulate the activation and proliferation of these infected cells, and argue that gonococci themselves may suppress the typical immune response associated with bacterial infection2.",

This occurs in a phase-variable manner so that expression of each gene can go in- or out-of-frame as a result of frequent variations in the number of penta-CTCTT repeats located at the beginning of the coding sequence. When human volunteers are inoculated with gonococci that are expressing all the opa genes out-of-frame, Opa-expressing variants are constantly selected soon after infection, which suggests a role for these proteins in the successful gonococci infection process3. The Opa proteins are adhesins that mediate bacterial uptake into epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as into phagocytosing leukocytes, via ligand binding. The large majority of Opa proteins in both gonococci and meningococci can bind various members of the CEACAM (also known as the CD66) receptor family4,5. Bacterial binding to CEACAM on epithelial and endothelial cells induces invasion of gonococci and transepithelial migration. In neutrophils, Opa-CEACAM interactions promote opsonin-independent phagocytosis.",

It also acts as a receptor for E-selectin, pathogenic and commensal Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae and murine corona viruses6. CEACAM1 is the only member of the CEACAM receptor family that is expressed on human lymphocytes, and its surface expression correlates with the activation state of the lymphocyte7. Boulton and Gray-Owen infected human CD4+ T cells with genetically defined gonococcal strains that expressed either Opa52, which binds CEACAM1, or Opa50, which binds heparan sulphate proteoglycans2. They show that Opa50-expressing bacteria increase the proportion of CD4+ T cells that express the early activation marker CD69. Interestingly, there was no such increase in the proportion of CD69-expressing effector cells when the CD4+ T cells were infected with an Opa52-expressing strain. The down-regulating effect of Opa52 gonococci on effector cells was accompanied by a reduced proliferative response by CD4+ T lymphocytes to activation stimuli such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) or CD3 ligation. The immunosuppressive effects seen with CEACAM1-binding gonococci were similar to those obtained with CEACAM-specific antibodies, which suggests that CEACAM1 ligation was responsible for the immunosuppressive effects observed.",

Other gonococcal surface molecules may also act as direct or indirect immunostimulators, rather than immunsuppressors, of T lymphocytes. For example, the neisserial outer membrane porin proteins can activate T cells by inducing CD80 (also known as B7-2), which is a costimulatory molecule, on B cells8. Boulton and Gray-Owen show that gonococci expressing adhesive pili stimulate lymphocyte proliferation even better than pilus-deficient Opa50-expressing gonococci2. Gonococcal pili interact with CD46\u2014a complement regulatory receptor for C3b, as well as a receptor for several pathogens9, that acts as a potent costimulatory molecule for human T cells\u2014inducing strong T cell proliferation10. It is therefore possible that the gonococcal pili influence lymphocyte proliferation by interaction with CD46. Other immunoactivation pathways have yet to be investigated for Neisseria-infected T lymphocytes.",

The mechanism proposed by Boulton and Gray-Owen2 is based on findings that the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 contains tyrosine residues that potentially interact with protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibition motif (ITIM) interacting with the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-211. Activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) would then activate Src kinase, allowing tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM1. Ligation of CEACAM1 by Opa, however, would allow recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 to ITIM, thereby increasing the activation threshold for T lymphocytes by dephosphorylating CEACAM1 (Fig. 1). Boulton and Gray-Owen show convincingly that CEACAM1 ligation to Opa52 induces SHP-1 and SHP-2 to bind this receptor, and that binding is dependent on TCR activation (via ligation of CD3\u025b).",

Even though this is the first example of immunosuppression caused by bacterial engagement of a coinhibitory receptor, bacterial pathogens may use other strategies to down-regulate the immune system. For example, upon infection, Salmonella typhimurium activates the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is normally induced by the innate immune response pathway that involves IL-12, natural killer cells and interferon-\u03b3 production by activated macrophages12. After immunization with an attenuated strain of S. typhimurium, murine splenocytes showed a profoundly suppressed capacity to mount an in vitro antibody plaque-forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes13. Evidence indicates that this suppression was mediated by NO, as the in vitro addition of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine abrogated suppression13. Because many pathogens will induce NO, this type of NO-mediated immunosuppression might be quite general.",
