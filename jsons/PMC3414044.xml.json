Because viable, transplanted organs are highly efficient vectors for microbial transmission into immunosuppressed hosts, transmission events in organ transplant recipients may serve as sentinel events for emerging infections.",

WNV also illustrates some of the challenges faced in detecting donor-derived transmission events in tissue recipients. In contrast to organ- and blood-derived infections, tissue transmission of WNV has not been reported. Lack of similar reports of WNV transmission to tissue recipients may reflect underrecognition, i.e., differences in transmissibility, clinical symptoms, diagnostic approaches, immunosuppression, clinical follow-up of the recipient, and underreporting (12). Detection of infections after tissue transplantation might be delayed when a donor-derived infectious source is less likely to be considered. Clinicians often consider tissue allografts safe despite published reports (13\u201319). Therefore, disease detection is dependent on skills, knowledge, and heightened awareness of clinicians caring for allograft recipients. Despite the absence of reported WNV transmission events, the large volume of tissue grafts and the potential availability of >100 tissue products from individual donors indicate the need for assessing and optimizing methods for identifying potential pathogens in tissue transplantation.",

Manufacturers must investigate such reports and report to the Food and Drug Administration serious adverse reactions for which there was a reasonable possibility that the cell or tissue caused the reaction (23,24). Such reporting depends on clinician recognition and reporting of an allograft-derived infection; underreporting is a recognized limitation of such programs. Given the general lack of awareness of the potential for donor-derived infection and multiple common sources of infection in a transplant recipient, such as the surgical procedure or nosocomial infection, there is great potential for underreporting.

New assay development is typically resource-intensive and too slow to reflect rapid shifts posed by epidemic disease (e.g., assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome), but can be accomplished over time (e.g., assay development during a WNV infection outbreak). New approaches to assay development and for evaluating such assays in organ and tissue donor populations, together with streamlined approaches to evaluating assay effectiveness in a manner appropriate to regulatory review, could enable more effective responses to threats of emerging infectious diseases.",

Individual tissue banks rely on hospitals to return implant cards to assess use of allograft materials; compliance is voluntary and accuracy of the data is limited by incomplete return rates. Regulatory mandates require OPO and organ transplant programs to report extensive data to the OPTN on all solid-organ donors (living and deceased), candidates on the waiting lists, and recipients. However, the discard rate of donor organs on the basis of microbiologic testing are not collected by OPTN and are retained at the local OPO rather than the national level. Improved testing might change the denominator by increasing or decreasing the number of available allografts for transplantation; collection of these data is needed to guide decisions regarding optimal donor testing in organ transplantation (27,28).",

Elements needed to develop such a research infrastructure will include shared data repositories and software for collecting and analyzing surveillance data from donors and recipients; common epidemiologic data elements; and universal donor identifiers that link all allograft types to the original donor (25), protocols, and standardized nomenclature. Such a networked infrastructure is essential for rapid traceability of tissues and organs from common donors when donor-derived disease outbreaks occur in transplant recipients (12).",

Recognizing emerging infectious diseases in organ and tissue transplantation is challenging because of nonstandardization of donor evaluations and data collection, pathogen characteristics, and recipient surveillance. Quantifying risk is further complicated by the absence of data regarding the factors affecting disease transmission. Gaps in systematic identification and characterization of the scope and magnitude of donor-derived infectious disease transmissions through organ and tissue transplantation remain a major hurdle to improvements in assessing risk and in developing more effective donor screening and testing strategies. These gaps can be addressed by a shared, overarching research agenda among the allograft communities. Areas of focus for research include compiling donor evaluation (donor screening and testing) and posttransplant recipient surveillance data and disease transmissibility data (basic mechanisms and clinical factors) and assessing the efficacy of mitigation strategies. Prioritizing the research agenda can be best driven by collaboration between government (i.e., regulatory, public health, policy), industry (e.g., tissue manufacturing, supply, test manufacturers), and the allograft transplant provider community (clinicians, hospitals, professional organizations, OPOs, tissue banks and processors). Each stakeholder has unique perspectives, experiences, and resources to share in enhancing the safety of organ and tissue transplantation and benefit the greatest number of recipients.",
