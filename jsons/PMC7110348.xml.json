NO has a wide range of functions in the body, from dilating blood vessels, aggregation of platelets, fighting infections and tumours, mediator of inflammation and macrophage cytotoxic activity to transmission of signals between nerve cells (1998, 1993, 1991). In optimal doses it has protective and regulatory action in cells, but higher concentrations have toxic effects. The enzyme NO synthase (NOS) contributes to signal transmission in different cell systems of body via synthesis of NO from l\u2010arginine in the presence of NADPH and dioxygen (O2). NOS binds flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, haeme, tetrahydrobiopterin and calmodulin. It activates cGMP, which inhibits calcium entry into the cell and decreases levels of intracellular calcium, and K+ channels, and stimulates a cGMP\u2010dependent protein kinase, etc. NOS has three isoforms (Table 1): the neuronal (nNOS or NOS1), inducible (iNOS or NOS2) and endothelial (eNOS or NOS3). Cytokines and other proinflammatory stimuli induce iNOS (1997a, 1997b). The activity of nNOS and eNOS is calcium\u2010 and calmodulin\u2010dependent, whereas that of iNOS is calcium\u2010independent. NO may regulate NOS expression and activity by negative feedback by the process of S\u2010nitrosylation.",

They produce subclinical infection or a mild self\u2010limiting disease, the dengue fever (DF) and a serious life\u2010threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is the most common arboviral disease of humans and is found in subtropical and tropical areas of the world located between 10\u00b0N and 10\u00b0S of the Equator. More than 2.5 billion persons are at risk of getting dengue infections. About 50\u2013100 million cases of DF occur every year, with about 250 000\u2013500 000 cases of DHF. The incidence of DHF has increased tremendously in India, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and the American tropics in the past 25 years, with major epidemics occurring in many countries. The risk factors for developing DHF are cocirculation of all four DV strains in the same area, host factors such as immune status, age and genetic background and the virus genotype. Patients with DHF may develop capillary leakage, resulting in flow of serum proteins and fluid into the body cavities, for example the pleural and abdominal cavities. Patients have haemorrhages in different parts of the body. Investigations show thrombocytopoenia, neutropoenia and elevated liver enzymes, and sometimes disseminated intravascular coagulation. DHF may progress to a hypotensive state, the DSS, with cold clammy skin and unrecordable pulse and blood pressure. The course of shock is short, but life\u2010threatening. DHF is observed commonly in infants and children who are exposed to a second dengue infection. The pathogenesis of DHF is still not fully understood despite extensive studies and has been a subject of controversy from the time the syndrome was first recognized (reviewed by 2008, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007).",

Chaturvedi and colleagues first reported the role of NO and peroxynitrite in DV infection in 1996 (1996a, 1996b, 1996), but its greater implications in dengue disease have been distinguished only recently. The hallmarks of the dengue disease, the antibody\u2010dependent enhancement (ADE; Halstead, 1970, 2007), the shift from T\u2010helper type 1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokine response (Chaturvedi et al., 1999) and the cytokine tsunami (2000, 2007) resulting in vascular leakage can now be explained much better with the knowledge gained about NO and peroxynitrite (2007, 2008a, 2008b). This paper makes an effort to present a synthesis of the current opinions to explain the pathogenesis of DHF/shock syndrome with NO on centre stage.

            "text": "Even at high concentrations NO does not kill cells by itself. For acute toxicity, NO reacts with superoxide anion and forms the peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which has a wider range of chemical targets (Fig. 1). It can oxidize proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA. The toxic effects of NO are due to its ability to modulate mitochondrial respiration, DNA synthesis and energy metabolism. Peroxynitrite inhibits enzymes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the functions of manganese SOD (MnSOD), which results in increased formation of superoxide anion. ONOO\u2212 efficiently modifies and breaks DNA strands and inhibits DNA ligase, which increases DNA strand breaks, which activate DNA repair mechanisms, including the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase (PARP). Activation of PARP results in a drop in energy stores that impairs cellular metabolism and causes cell death. Reactions of NO differ between in vitro and in vivo systems. The main degradation product of NO in vitro is NO2\n\u2212 (nitrite), whereas in vivo the main product is NO3\n\u2212 (nitrate). The constitutive enzymes nNOS and eNOS induce low concentrations of NO, which modulates the activity of haeme\u2010containing proteins, for example guanylyl cyclase as well as proteins of the mitochondria such as cytochromes (reviewed by 1991, 1993, 2007, 2007). Induction of iNOS generates higher concentrations of NO, which can nitrosylate cysteine residues or produce tyrosine nitration in different proteins and also deamination of DNA. Nitrotyrosine is a marker for the generation of peroxynitrite (Hanafy et al., 2001).",

Exogenous NO increases synthesis of tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lipopolysaccharide\u2010stimulated neutrophil preparations (Van Dervort et al., 1994). Endogenous NO is required for interleukin\u201012 (IL\u201012) production, whereas exogenous NO decreases IL\u201012 production by macrophages (Huang et al., 1998). The production of IL\u20106 and granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor mRNA is decreased in iNOS knockout mice or in normal animals treated with iNOS inhibitors (Hierholzer et al., 1998). NO is involved in cytokine signaling, as in iNOS\u2010deficient mice some cytokine signaling is lost. iNOS is required for IL\u201012\u2010mediated T\u2010cell proliferation and activation and also for natural killer cell activation by interferon\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2) (Diefenbach et al., 1999). Production of large amounts of NO by macrophages leads to inactivation of lymphocytes and induces a persistent immunosuppression in HIV infection (reviewed by Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2001). NO plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In the right situations and right concentrations it is anti\u2010inflammatory and has protective effects against various infections. On the other hand, in abnormal situations and higher concentrations NO is a proinflammatory mediator, inducing inflammation and pathological lesions. NO belongs to the labile radical entities, the reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reacts with oxygen and haeme\u2010iron\u2010containing groups, reducing nitrate compounds.",

            "text": "\nDing et al. (1988) screened the effect of 12 different cytokines on the production of nitrite by macrophages and found that the most effective was IFN\u2010\u03b3. Further, NO production is inhibited by type 2 cytokines [IL\u20104, IL\u201010, IL\u201013, transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2)] (MacMicking et al., 1997a). Therefore iNOS expression may depend on Th1\u2013Th2 shift in the hosts. An enhanced Th1 response is observed in NO\u2010deficient mice during infections and antigenic stimulation, resulting in more production of interferon and less of IL\u20104 (1998, 1998), indicating that NO selectively inhibits the expansion of Th1 cells by a negative feedback mechanism. Selective inhibition of IL\u201012 synthesis by activated macrophages may be responsible for this to some extent (Huang et al., 1998). On the other hand, low concentrations of NO produced during the early stages of infection result in a strong Th1\u2010type response, which is effective in host defence against intracellular pathogens (Niedbala et al., 1999). A synergistic effect of IL\u201018 and IL\u201012 has been observed in the induction of Th1\u2010type cells (Robinson et al., 1997). The precise mechanism of the action of low concentrations of NO in the Th1 type is not fully known, but recently Niedbala et al. (2006) have suggested that the enhancing effect of low concentrations of NO is mediated by cGMP by exerting a direct and selective effect on Th1 cells and not via antigen\u2010presenting cells. Low concentrations of NO in endothelial cells (Umansky et al., 1998) and macrophages (Connelly et al., 2001) upregulates nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) activity and the high doses downregulates it. cGMP may also act through the P\u2010Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Thus, NO is also responsible for the induction of T\u2010cell subset response. Niedbala et al. (2007) have reported a new subset of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) derived from CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells induced by NO. The induction of Tregs (NO\u2010Tregs) is independent of cGMP but depends on p53, IL\u20102 and OX40. NO\u2010Tregs produce IL\u20104 and IL\u201010, but not IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3 or TGF\u2010\u03b2. The cells are GITR+, CD27+, T\u2010betlow, GATA3high and Foxp3. NO\u2010Tregs suppress the proliferation of CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells in vitro and function in an IL\u201010\u2010dependent manner. NO\u2010Tregs are also induced in vivo in SCID mice adoptively transferred with CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and IFN\u2010\u03b3, and the induction is completely inhibited by N\nG\u2010monomethyl\u2010l\u2010arginine (NMMA), a pan NOS inhibitor (Niedbala et al., 2007).",

            "text": "NO has a variable effect on the replication of viruses; it inhibits the replication of most of them, whereas it enhances some viruses, and has no effect on a few of the other viruses (Table 3). NO inhibits viral replication by reversible S\u2010nitrosylation of viral proteases (Zaragoza et al., 1997). Another antiviral mechanism of NO is via the formation of peroxynitrite, which blocks viral entry into the host cell (Padalko et al., 2004). NO has strong antiviral effects on hantavirus replication and peroxynitrite has strong antiviral effects on mature free virions, suggesting that different reactive nitrogen intermediates can have different effects on various parts of the replication cycle for the same virus (Klingstr\u00f6m et al., 2006). Peroxynitrite enhances Sendai viral mutation in vitro and expands the quasispecies spectrum, facilitating the evolution of RNA viruses (Akaike et al., 2000). NO may accelerate viral mutation via formation of 8\u2010nitroguanosine, which may be a substantial contributor to erroneous RNA replication of the virus. NO\u2010generated 8\u2010nitroguanosine may cause viral mutation via two different mechanisms: directly, through incorporation into template RNAs for viral replication, and indirectly, by enhanced oxidative stress because of its potent redox\u2010active property (Yoshitake et al., 2004). NO has a unique biological effect on the genome of both pathogen and host via chemical modification of nucleic acids (2000, 2003). NO can act on viral proteins by different mechanisms. NO inhibits Coxsackie virus infection by nitration of the VP1 capsid protein (Padalko et al., 2004) or by S\u2010nitrosylation of the cysteine protease 3C (Saura et al., 1999). HIV\u20101 is inhibited by S\u2010nitrosylation of the viral protease by NO (Persichini et al., 1998). Modification of cellular proteins can also inhibit viral infection, for example S\u2010nitrosylation of NF\u2010\u03baB downregulates expression of the transactivator Zta, which is required for reactivation of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Mannick et al., 1994), and tyrosine nitration of microtubules attenuates respiratory syncytial virus infection (Huang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "NO and peroxynitrite are double\u2010edged swords having both beneficial and harmful effects on the host during infections, resulting in pathological lesions (Table 4). Peroxynitrite is harmful to the host when present in high concentrations, oxidizing lipids and DNA, and oxidizing or nitrating proteins. However, peroxynitrite in low concentrations may be beneficial to the host during pathogen infection (Padalko et al., 2004). Nitrative stress\u2010mediated 8\u2010nitroguanosine formation during influenza or Sendai virus infection involves unique biochemical and pharmacological properties such as redox activity and mutagenic potential, which contributes to pathogenic processes during viral infection (Zaki et al., 2005). Central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response to neurotropic virus infection is likely to be dependent upon the activity of peroxynitrite or its products on the blood\u2013brain barrier (Hooper et al., 2001). Infection with virulent Coxsackie virus in mice increases expression of iNOS and produces inflammatory myocardial disease (Bevan et al., 2001). Adenovirus infection increases iNOS and peroxynitrite production in the lung, generating nitrotyrosine, and may contribute to inflammatory responses in the lung (Zsengell\u00e9r et al., 2001). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can stimulate the production of NO through activation of the iNOS gene by the viral core and NS3 proteins. NO causes DNA breaks and enhances DNA mutation. This sequence of events provides a mechanism for HCV pathogenesis and oncogenesis (Machida et al., 2004). On the other hand, enhanced oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of viral infections. HIV\u2010infected patients have a higher incidence of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease than uninfected individuals (Table 4). Recent reports have demonstrated that viral proteins upregulate ROS, which may contribute to elevated cardiovascular risk in HIV\u20101 patients (Kline et al., 2008). Using an HIV\u20101 transgenic rat model it has been shown that HIV\u20101 protein expression decreases NO and causes endothelial dysfunction. Diminished antioxidant capacity increases vascular superoxide levels, which reduce NO bioavailability and promote peroxynitrite generation. Restoring glutathione levels reverses HIV\u20101 protein\u2010mediated effects on superoxide, NO and vasorelaxation (Kline et al., 2008). Experimental murine encephalitis induced by Junin virus increases expression of iNOS by unidentified cells, concomitant with the astrocyte reaction. The specific inhibition of iNOS is associated with greater mortality but lower astrocytosis (Table 4), suggesting that the protective role of NO is related to enhanced astrocyte activation, representing a beneficial cellular response to virus\u2010induced CNS damage (G\u00f3mez et al., 2003).",

Anti\u2010E antibodies are the main response against DV. The antibodies inhibit viral binding to cells, neutralize viral infectivity in vitro, protect mice from DV challenge on passive transfer and show a variable degree of cross\u2010reactivity among the DV serotypes. NS1 is a key glycoprotein involved in the production of infectious virus and the pathogenesis of dengue diseases. During the replication of DV, NS1 associates with the membrane on the cell surface and in the RNA replication complex (Noisakran et al., 2008). NS1 is expressed on the surface of the virus\u2010infected cells and is secreted into the circulation as a soluble multimer; it is an important target of antibodies against DV. Antibodies against NS1 can trigger complement\u2010mediated lysis of DV\u2010infected cells in vitro and protect mice from DV challenge. But the cross\u2010reaction of these antibodies with endothelial cells leads to expression of cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecules, resulting in cell damage. NS3 is a multifunctional protein; it is the main antigen that stimulates DV\u2010reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell (reviewed by 2008, 2006b). NS3 has located at the active site of a trypsin\u2010like serine protease and, together with the NS2B cofactor, forms an active protease that is required for polyprotein processing. NS3 also has an RNA\u2010stimulated NTPase and RNA helicase that is important for viral RNA replication, as well as 5\u2032\u2010RNA triphosphatase activity. NS5 is required for viral RNA replication and is an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (O'Reilly & Kao, 1998). In flavivirus\u2010infected cells, NS3 and NS5 exist in a complex and are thought to be components of the viral RNA replicase complex (1995, 2003). A role of NS3 and NS5 in virus replication and 5\u2032\u2010capping has been suggested due to their enzymatic activities but the functions of the other nonstructural proteins are not clear (Benarroch et al., 2004).",

The important hypothesis put forward regarding the role of host factors are ADE of DV replication, shift of Th1\u2010 to Th2\u2010type cytokine response and other T\u2010cell responses resulting into cytokine tsunami. The viral factors include genotypic mutation, for example the Southeast Asian type of DV produces DHF in children, whereas the American genotype does not. Some of these mechanisms are discussed briefly. Non\u2010neutralizing anti\u2010DV antibodies from an earlier infection by a heterologous serotype of DV mediate ADE. They form complexes with the infecting DV leading to greater uptake by macrophages and consequent greater numbers of DV\u2010infected cells. The first suggestion of an association of increased risk for DHF with a secondary DV infection was made in 1970s (Halstead, 1970). A subpopulation of CD4+ T cells produce a unique cytokine, cytotoxic factor (CF) during DV infection of mice and man (hCF). CF induces H2\u2010A\u2010positive macrophages to produce another cytokine, macrophage cyototoxin (CF2), which amplifies its cytotoxic effects on target cells (Fig. 3). The hCF purified from the sera of DHF patients appear to be pathogenesis\u2010related proteins, capable of reproducing DHF\u2010like pathological lesions on inoculation in mice, such as increased capillary permeability, cerebral oedema and blood leukocyte changes (1998, 1991, 1997, 1997). The highest levels of hCF\u2010autoantibodies are seen in sera of patients with mild illness (DF) and the lowest in patients with DHF grade IV (Chaturvedi et al., 2001; reviewed by 2006a, 2006b).",

The antigen\u2010specific TS cascade in DV\u2010infected mice consists of three generations of TS and their secretary soluble suppressor cytokines (SF), with in between macrophages transmitting the signals (Fig. 3). DV\u2010induced suppressor pathway suppresses antigen\u2010specific antibody production, including that of enhancing antibody. Thus increased replication of the virus mediated by the enhancing antibody and the immunopathology mediated by the immune complex is prevented. On the other hand, suppression of neutralizing antibody would delay elimination of DV from the body, causing pathological lesions. TS can also increase the severity by producing IL\u201010/TGF\u2010\u03b2 (1984, 2007). Both IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010\u03b2 suppress NO production (1992, 1993) and may increase the virus load and the severity of dengue disease. The outcome may depend upon the fine balance between them.",

Serum levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 are the highest in DF and the lowest in severe DHF cases. On the other hand, serum levels of IL\u20104, IL\u201010 and IL\u20106 are maximum in DHF patients and negligible in patients with DF. The levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 in the sera increase with the increase of severity of DHF (Chaturvedi et al., 1999). The most significant finding was a shift of the predominant Th1\u2010type response observed in 66% of the DF patients to Th2\u2010type response seen in 71% of DHF grade IV, indicating a role of Th2 cells in the pathogenesis of DHF (Chaturvedi et al., 1999). During acute infection in children, few dengue\u2010responsive CD8+ T cells are recovered that show an activated phenotype and undergo apoptosis. These DV\u2010specific T cells have a low affinity for the infecting virus and a higher affinity for previously encountered strains. Cross\u2010reactive DV\u2010specific T cells show high cytokine production, which may contribute to the vascular leakage. DV\u2010specific memory lymphocyte response has been detected even 20 years after a primary infection by DV. Induction of cross\u2010reactive memory T cells (mainly NS3\u2010specific) during a secondary infection leads to increased incidence of DHF and DSS. When viral peptides complexed with HLA molecules are presented to memory T cells, proliferation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines follow, which can directly affect vascular endothelial cells, resulting in plasma leakage (2003, 2006). Recently, Ubol et al. (2008b) have shown that during DF, genes in the interferon system and complement inhibitor play a role in lowering virus production and reducing tissue damage. In patients with DHF, the dysfunction of immune cells, complement, and cytokines increases viral load and tissue damage. Profound T\u2010cell activation and death may contribute to the systemic disturbances leading to DHF, and original antigenic sin in the T\u2010cell responses may suppress or delay viral elimination, leading to higher viral loads and increased immunopathology (reviewed by 2008, 2007, 2006, 2007, 2008). Further, the increased serum levels of IL\u20108 (Raghupathy et al., 1998) and TGF\u2010\u03b21 (Agarwal et al., 1999) are associated with increasing severity of DHF and death. Thus, the cascades of T\u2010cell activation resulting in a \u2018tsunami\u2019 of cytokines and other chemical mediators (\u2018cytokine tsunami\u2019) released mainly from T cells, monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells, ultimately cause an increase in vascular permeability and lead to DHF/DSS.",

Maximum NO2\n\u2212 production occurred in the spleen cells 45 min after intravenous inoculation of mice with CF. The NO2\n\u2212 was produced by macrophages (Misra et al., 1996a).

It was concluded that the cell apoptosis was mediated by NO+O\u2212 (peroxynitrite) and not by H2O2 (1996b, 1998).

Activation of DV\u2010infected monocytes based on induction of iNOS occurred both in vivo and in vitro, and the susceptibility of DV to NO production was noted. NO inhibits aggregation, recruitment and adhesion of platelets to the vascular endothelium. Mendes\u2010Ribeiro et al.

DV\u2010stimulated spleen cell culture supernatants showed a peak production of both CF and NO2\n\u2212 at 72 h. Pretreatment of spleen cells with NMMA inhibited NO2\n\u2212 production. NO2\n\u2212 production was abrogated in a dose\u2010dependent manner by treatment of spleen cells with the Ca2+ channel blocking drug nifedipine. Thus, DV\u2010induced CF induces production of NO2\n\u2212 in spleen cells, probably in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner, and may be a mechanism of target cell killing (Misra et al., 1996a). Further, DV, CF or CF2 induce production of superoxide anion (O2\n\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the mouse spleen cell cultures. It was suggested that O2\n\u2212 and nitrite are necessary for cell killing by CF/CF2 in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner and the killing may possibly be by generation of peroxynitrite (1996b, 1998). In another study it was shown that NO transmits the DV\u2010specific suppressor signal intracellularly in macrophages (Khare & Chaturvedi, 1997). DV infection induces a biphasic activation of Kupffer cells in cultures: there is one peak of activation shortly after infection which involves the production of NO and IFN\u2010\u03b1, and a second peak after a few hours involving IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 synthesis. DV\u2010replicating Kupffer cells undergo apoptosis and are cleared by phagocytosis. The timing of the synthesis of these soluble mediators suggests the involvement of a very early step of infection in their activation (Marianneau et al., 1999). Valero et al. (2002) reported that in vitro incubation of human platelets with DV did not increase levels of NO. Chen & Wang (2002) reported that after DV infection, the in vitro\u2010differentiated monocyte/macrophages secrete multiple innate cytokines and chemokines, including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20108, IL\u201012, MIP\u20101\u03b1 and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) but not IL\u20106, IL\u201015 or NO. Human monocyte cultures infected with DV show increased numbers of apoptotic cells and increased production of TNF\u2010\u03b1. No increase in production of NO was observed. These results may be related to early primary viral infection in which virus could induce apoptosis in monocytes, but monocytes may contribute to host defence mechanisms against virus by viral phagocytosis, phagocytosis of infected apoptotic cells, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Espina et al., 2003).",

Further, it suppresses the transcription and translation of IL\u201012, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, whereas the expression and synthesis of the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL\u20106 and IL\u201010 are enhanced.

NO inhibited viral replication via suppressed RNA synthesis, resulting in reduction of NS1 synthesis. Thus, NO may serve as a defence that diminishes viral load in patients. Further, the activity of recombinant DV NS5 in negative\u2010strand RNA synthesis is affected in the presence of 5 mM SNAP in in vitro RdRp assays, whereas the RNA helicase activity of DV NS3 is not inhibited (Takhampunya et al., 2006). Thus, the inhibitory effect of NO on DV infection is partly via inhibition of the RdRp activity, which then downregulates viral RNA synthesis. The clinical isolates of DV have been divided into two groups on the basis of their sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of NO radical on viral replication. Ubol et al. (2008a) have studied genotypic differences at the level of the amino acid sequence of the NS5 gene between NO\u2010sensitive viruses isolated from DF patients and NO\u2010resistant isolates from DHF patients. They found that these two groups of viruses contain different amino acid sequences at position 621\u2013646 in the active site of NS5, suggesting that the response to the inhibitory effect of NO radical may, at least in part, be regulated by NS5. They have also studied the differences in global gene expression of NO\u2010producing host cells in response to infection by the two groups of isolates using cDNA array analysis.

NO production may initiate or suppress apoptosis but the mechanism is not fully understood. Macrophage lineage cells replicate DV and are professional NO producers. NO produced by them downregulates replication of DV. DV\u2010infected mice spleen cells produce NO2\n\u2212. CF/CF2 induce production of NO2\n\u2212 in the spleen cells in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner, which may be a mechanism of target cell killing (Mukerjee et al., 1996). CF2 also induces production of superoxide anion (O2\n\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the spleen cells of mice in vitro and in vivo and the killing (Fig. 3) appears to be by generation of peroxynitrite (1996a, 1996b, 1998). Neves\u2010Souza et al. (2005) reported that activation of DV\u2010infected monocytes is based on induction of iNOS both in vivo and in vitro. A mechanism through which NO acts is via endothelin (ET\u20101), which is produced by endothelial cells. Thrombin, cytokines and ROS, etc., stimulate the vascular endothelium to produce and release ET\u20101. Release of ET\u20101 is inhibited by prostacyclin and NO. Binding of ET\u20101 to endothelial ETb receptors stimulates the formation of NO. In the absence of smooth muscle endothelin receptor stimulation, this NO causes vasodilation (reviewed by Iglarz & Clozel, 2007; Basu & Chaturvedi, 2008). DV infection of human umbilical cord endothelial cells inhibits the production of ET\u20101 and prostacyclin 2, thus affecting their normal functions of secretion of vasoactive substances, resulting in increased vascular permeability and impairment of homoeostasis and blood coagulation (Jiang et al., 1999).",

Further, the mitochondria\u2010dependent pathway that is regulated by NO production causes endothelial cell apoptosis in this system (Lin et al., 2004). Yen et al. (2008) have reported macrophage infiltration into the vicinity of the endothelium, increased TNF\u2010\u03b1 production and endothelial cell apoptosis in the tissues with increased expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in endothelium in the haemorrhagic tissues in DV\u2010infected mice.

Replication of NO\u2010sensitive DV is inhibited by the generation of NO, resulting in lower virus load and consequently a milder dengue disease, DF (Fig. 5). The NO\u2010resistant DV are virulent, have a higher replication rate and have a stronger influence on host genetic response as compared with the NO\u2010susceptible DV. NO\u2010resistant DV induce greater expression of immune response\u2010related genes, for example genes involving cytokines/chemokines, activation of T cells, B cells, platelets and inflammatory cells. This may result in the interaction between platelets, vascular endothelial cells and inflammatory cells that induces vascular leakage. Further, NO\u2010resistant DV significantly upregulate IL\u20106, IL\u20107, IL\u20108, RANTES and MCP\u20103, which are correlated with increased DHF.

Higher levels of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 that may be involved in vascular leakage and haemorrhage are found in DHF/DSS patients but not in DF patients (1999, 1998).
