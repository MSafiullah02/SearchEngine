Here, we present analytic expressions of the epidemic threshold in a Weibull and a Gamma SIS epidemic on any network, where the infection time is Weibull, respectively, Gamma, but the recovery time is exponential. The theory is compared with precise simulations. The mean-field non-Markovian epidemic thresholds, both for a Weibull and Gamma infection time, are physically similar and interpreted via the occurrence time of an infection during a healthy period of each node in the graph. Our theory couples the type of a viral item, specified by a shape parameter of the Weibull or Gamma distribution, to its corresponding network-wide endemic spreading power, which is specified by the mean-field non-Markovian epidemic threshold in any network.",

The topology of the graph G is represented by a symmetric N \u00d7 N adjacency matrix A with spectral radius \u03bb 1 , which is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A of the contact graph. In an SIS epidemic process [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] on the graph G, the viral state of a node i at time t is specified by a Bernoulli random variable X i (t ) \u2208 {0, 1}: X i (t ) = 0, when node i is healthy, but susceptible, and X i (t ) = 1, when node i is infected at time t. A node i at time t can only be in one of these two states: infected, with probability Pr[X i (t ) = 1], or healthy but susceptible to the infection, with probability Pr[X i (t ) = 0] = 1 \u2212 Pr[X i (t ) = 1]. The recovery or curing process for node i is a Poisson process with rate \u03b4 and the infection rate over the link (i, j) is a Poisson process with rate \u03b2. Only when node i is infected can it infect its healthy direct neighbors with rate \u03b2. All Poisson curing and infection processes are independent. This description defines the continuous-time, Markovian homogeneous SIS epidemic process on a graph G. The SIS process can be alternatively described in terms of \"time\" random variables, which is valuable for the remainder of this article. The recovery time R of a node i is the duration between the time at which node i is just infected and the subsequent time at which node i is again recovered and healthy. Analogously, the infection time T is the time needed for a just infected node to infect * P.F.A.VanMieghem@tudelft.nl \u2020 Q.L.Liu@tudelft.nl one of its direct, healthy neighbors. In a Poisson process [8] , interevent times are exponentially distributed so that both recovery time R and infection time T are exponential random variables with mean E [R] = 1 \u03b4 and E [T ] = 1 \u03b2 , respectively. We do not consider (a) heterogeneous epidemics, where each node i can have its own curing rate \u03b4 i and each link (i, j) its own infection rate \u03b2 i j nor (b) time-dependent rates \u03b2(t ) and \u03b4(t ) as in Ref. [9] . Perhaps, more importantly, we limit ourselves to a mean-field approximation of the SIS process.",

[11, 12] , the Weibullian SIS model is extensively studied, generalizes the Markovian process, and parameterizes the non-Markovian behavior via the shape parameter \u03b1 in Eq. (1) . The limiting case \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e of the Weibullian SIS process is analyzed by a mean-field governing equation in Ref. [13] , when the Weibull probability density function Eq. (1) reduces to a Dirac delta function and the corresponding epidemic threshold was found to be 1/ ln(1 + \u03bb 1 ). Simulations hinted that 1/ ln(1 + \u03bb 1 ) is the largest epidemic threshold for any Weibull infection time. That result is partly verified in Ref. [14] by an independent simulation, based on Ref. [15] and revisited here in Sec. V. In epidemiology, the infection time T is called the generation time [16] , which characterizes the infectivity of pathogens and is defined as the time between the infections (or the symptoms onsets) of the primary case and the secondary case infected by the primary case. The generation time is usually obtained by monitoring the first cases and secondary cases in households and follows skewed distributions, which have been fitted by the Gamma, Weibull, or lognormal distribution. For example, Heijne et al. [17] evaluated a norovirus outbreak [18] in Sweden in 1999 by fitting the generation time with a Gamma distribution. Cowling et al. [19] fitted the generation time of influenza in Hong Kong with all the three distributions and indicated that the Weibull distribution performs slightly better than the Gamma and lognormal distributions, based on the Akaike information criterion. The generation time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore in 2003 is well fitted by the Weibull distribution [20] . Furthermore, the Weibull distribution was also used to fit [21] the generation time of an Ebola outbreak in Uganda in 2000. In summary, real disease measurements suggest to consider Weibull, Gamma, and lognormal infection times.",

We present Lagrange series for the Weibull mean-field epidemic threshold in Sec.

The other variant, where the recovery time R is exponential and the infection time T is more attractive and explored further in this paper. As shown in Ref.

We consider the two most used distributions for the infection time T in real diseases, a Weibull and Gamma distribution, whose main difference lies in the tail behavior.

We will show that the Gamma distribution possesses a simple analytic mean-field epidemic threshold Eq. (11) below, while the corresponding computation for the Weibull (Sec. VI) is involved.

Figure 1 illustrates the scaled probability \u03b7(\u03c3, \u03c1) that a Weibullian renewal event occurs between \u03c3 and \u03c3 + d\u03c3 , given that there is precisely one renewal in an interval [0, \u03c1] versus normalized time \u03c3 \u2208 [0, \u03c1] for \u03c1 = 1 time unit, expressed in b seconds, and various values of \u03b1. Figure 1 indicates that the regime \u03b1 < 1 models a different behavior than the regime \u03b1 > 1 (as also follows from the functional equation (A5) of the probability generating function). For \u03b1 < 1, a Weibull event occurs increasingly likely at smaller times, the smaller \u03b1 is. For \u03b1 > 1, the occurrence of a Weibull event is more evenly distributed over the entire interval with preference at later times. Figure 1 may also be consulted in practice to characterize a disease, if the occurrence time of an infection can be measured for an SIS process (with repeated infections and recoveries for each node). Indeed, if the recovery of each node is deterministic at t, 2t, 3t, . . ., then Fig. 1 shows that Weibullian infections with small shape parameter \u03b1 occur most likely soon after the recovery moment, implying that the node is infected most of the time. A large \u03b1, however, reflects that a node is with high probability healthy for a long time, but becomes infected, just before the recovery of the next cycle takes place. For a random time interval V , a similar interpretation holds, but the recovery times for each node occur at different times V 1 , V 2 , . . . (almost surely) and these differences per node complicate network-wide prognoses of the evolutions of the SIS epidemic.",

It is known [27] that the SIS mean-field approximation is reasonably accurate for ER graphs, less accurate for scale-free graphs, but inaccurate for d-dimensional lattices (and the worst for a path, a one-dimensional lattice), which explains the larger deviation for a rectangular grid. are positive. Consequently, \u03c4 (1) c,W (\u03b1; K ) > \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1), for \u03b1 > 1. Moreover, c n (\u03b1) decreases with \u03b1 \u2208 [1, \u221e), which implies that \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1) increases with \u03b1 towards \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u221e) = 1 ln (1+\u03bb 1 ) . For large realistic graphs, the spectral radius \u03bb 1 can be large so that ( 1 \u03b1 +1) \u2192 1 for sufficiently large \u03b1 and the right-hand side Lagrange series converges slowly with a comparable convergence rate as the geometric series toward its pole at z = 1. In fact, for \u03bb 1 \u2192 \u221e, we find that \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1) \u2192 0 and the Lagrange series Eq. (19) , valid for \u03b1 1, diverges! However, in these limit regimes, either the asymptotic expression Eq. (17) is applicable or the series needs to be transformed, e.g., by the Euler transform [26] .",

In the small \u03b1 regime, infections occur predominantly early during the healthy period for each node, so that the larger part of the nodes is longer infected. To cause a network-wide persistence of the epidemic, the viral item only needs a small \"push\" to infect a substantial part of the nodes long enough to enter the endemic state. In other words, a weak strength of the viral item to infect nodes, which is related to the effective infection rate \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1), is sufficient to cause endemic behavior. As a consequence, \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1) is small for small \u03b1, which agrees with Figure 2 . The other regime for large \u03b1 is understood analogously. Most nodes are likely most of the time healthy and infected only shortly when \u03b1 is large. Hence, the strength of the viral item to cause the network-wide persistence of the epidemic must be high, resulting in a high effective infection rate \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1). The one-to-one relation between \u03b1 and \u03be of the infection time distributions with the corresponding thresholds \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1) and \u03c4 (1) c; (\u03be ), immediately couples the type of viral item k (via a specific value of \u03b1 k or \u03be k or of another distribution) to its endemic impact \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1 k ) and \u03c4 (1) c; (\u03be k ) on any contact network (assuming a mean-field approximation).

The criterion Eq. (4) for the epidemic threshold shows that the analysis can be repeated for any other distribution of the infection time and other recovery times than exponential. Thus, the presented Weibull and Gamma analysis may serve as a guideline for computations with other distributions. Since the SIR epidemic threshold is slightly higher than the SIS epidemics (due to re-infections that potentially lead to more infected nodes), the SIS non-Markovian threshold can be regarded as a lower bound for SIR, so enlarging the scope of the presented theory. Finally, as the influence of the underlying contact graph is incorporated, the non-Markovian thresholds \u03c4 (1) c;W (\u03b1), \u03c4 (1) c; (\u03be ) and \u03c4 (1) c;l (\u03c3 \u22121 ) may be more suitable than the classical reproduction number R 0 , which is critically reconsidered in Ref.
