This novel coronavirus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the Coronaviridae family that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (3, 4) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (5, 6) . As of April 13, 2020, 1773084 cases have been diagnosed with COVID-19 globally, mainly consisting of 913349 cases in European region and 610742 cases in the United States, resulting in 111652 deaths to now (7) . Governments have taken decisive and comprehensive measures to contain the spread of the disease, including early isolation of suspected patients to cut off the transmission route and frequent disinfection. The medical authorities and workers have made great efforts in developing a curative vaccine for the disease, which is still in clinical trials for further effect validation.",

Therefore, it is now the focus of research workers to effectively detect and diagnose COVID-19 as early as possible. Currently, a positive result of real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the reference standard for diagnosing COVID-19, which is a time-consuming laboratory test, and a large number of countries may confront a shortage of the detection kits for SARS-CoV-2. It may also yield a false-negative result in the early stages of the disease in some cases (9, 10) . Chest CT may prove to be a valuable diagnostic method in patients with typical clinical characteristics, because some features of the disease may be present on CT images even when the RT-PCR screening test is negative (11) .",

Several studies have further indicated that imaging features on chest CT have the potential to predict the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (8, (14) (15) (16) . These studies investigated some major CT features of the extent of disease involvement and lesion patterns, including ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and peripheral distribution.

This newly described feature has not been evaluated with a large sample size before. One study revealed that the preference location for this lobe may correlated with the anatomic characteristics of the right lobar bronchus, the straight and steep bronchus of the right lower lobe, as well as the small angle between the right lower lobe and the long axis of the trachea, which might lead to the preference for invasion of this lobe (22) . We evaluated the prevalence of three or more pulmonary lobes involvement since no previous meta-analysis summarized this feature, and we found that 65% of patients in 438 cases presented with three or more lobes involved, which is also consistent with the previous results of predominantly bilateral involvement (14, 29, 30, 38) .

In terms of the extent of infection involvement, a previous study indicated that if one or two lobes are involved, clinical symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea and the impact on lung function are not significant(34), and the lesions can be absorbed if effective treatment is applied. Xu Y. H. et al. indicated that severe and critically severe COVID-19 cases most commonly had 4-5 lobes involved(31), Bernheim A et al. also suggested that the extent of infection on CT images may have some connection with the progression and severity(33).",
