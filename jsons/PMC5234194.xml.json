Exacerbations of COPD form one of the most common medical admissions, especially during winter when respiratory viral infections are common. Exacerbations are regarded to be infective in most cases, and viruses are believed to be a common cause of exacerbations. We have recently reported that influenza A and B viruses are associated with about 8% of COPD exacerbations.[4] Data regarding the contribution of other respiratory viruses in the causation of exacerbations of COPD are scant, especially from the developing countries. We herewith report our results of testing of patients for other respiratory viruses in patients with COPD exacerbation.",

Kashmir has a temperate geography in contrast with the generally more tropical climate in the rest of the country, and we have earlier reported a temperate seasonality of influenza virus circulation[56] which contributes to the exacerbations of COPD in 8% cases.[4] Demographic and clinical parameters were recorded in each case. Twin nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients as described earlier.[4] Tested for respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza (PIV) 1, 2, 3,[7] and 4,[8] human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A and B,[9] influenza A and B, enterovirus, corona NL65, OC43, and 229E viruses,[10] adenovirus 2 and 4,[11] rhinovirus,[10] and bocavirus,[12] were performed by in-house standardized duplex real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using previously published primers and probes. The details of the enrollment and testing for influenza among these patients have been reported elsewhere.[4] Briefly, nasal and throat swabs were collected from participants at enrollment for testing by RT-PCR for influenza A and B viruses, and those positive for influenza A viruses were further subtyped for A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, and seasonal H1N1 using US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocols.",

The detection rate of respiratory viruses in our study was similar to previous reports by Walsh et al.[13] However, McManus et al. reported a detection rate of 37% among their subjects with AECOPD.[14] In a recent meta-analysis of 17 eligible studies, weighted overall prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD was 39.3% compared to 13.6% in four studies in stable COPD, a pooled risk ratio for respiratory viral infection being 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0\u20138.5) for AECOPD as compared with stable COPD, rhinovirus being the most common detected one. The results suggested that respiratory viruses probably are important etiological agents in patients with AECOPD as compared with the stable COPD patients.[15]",

            "text": "Since empirical utilization of antibiotics has prompted disturbing levels of antibiotic resistance, it would be very useful to distinguish between the viral and the bacterial etiology of AECOPD so that antibiotic use could be curtailed and properly rationalized. Antibiotic use in severe COPD exacerbations has been recommended routinely, even as there is a paucity of placebo-controlled clinical trials and up to today, no single study has been powered sufficiently to prove the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in AECOPD.[21] In a recent Cochrane review of 16 randomized controlled studies involving 2068 patients, the authors concluded that antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit. However, for outpatients and inpatients, the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957\u20132012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Furthermore, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) could be avoided.[22] While some clinical and lab parameters have been suggested to distinguish between the two, in a recent study in which viruses were isolated from 22% of 72 enlisted patients of AECOPD, bacterial diseases could not be separated from viral disease by white cell number, CRP or procalcitonin levels.[23] However, the utility of these parameters needs to be probed further, and there is a distinct need for a biomarker for distinguishing the bacterial from a viral infection. An extensive placebo-controlled study is underway in Germany to assess if anti-microbial treatment is at all needed in COPD exacerbations.[21]",

All the three patients who died had H3N2 detected in them, and this could argue in favor of starting antiviral medication in patients with AECOPD, pending a result of the respiratory specimen, when a patient of AECOPD presents with features of influenza-like illness or a severe acute respiratory infection during a time of heightened activity of influenza circulation. According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have a severe, complicated, or progressive illness or who require hospitalization.[24] Antiviral treatment for influenza is recommended especially for patients who are at a higher risk for influenza-associated complications and chronic pulmonary disease for one such group. De-escalation to antivirals alone might be justified if the testing of the respiratory specimens returns positive for influenza. However, this approach would require further study on sufficiently powered patient groups.",
