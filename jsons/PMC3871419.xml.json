As of November 26th 68 deaths of 160 laboratory confirmed cases have been recorded by the WHO mainly from countries in the Middle East 2. The detection of MERS-CoV infected cases depends primary on sensitive real-time RT-PCR 3 . In developing countries, facilities for performing real-time RT-PCR are limited to centralized laboratories. The time to result can therefore be long and in many cases last up to several days. A portable, rapid, cheap, and sensitive test is needed to identify infected acute cases and would help to improve the onsite search for animal reservoirs.",

The recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay is an isothermal amplification technology 4. RPA assays run at 42\u00b0C for 15 minutes 5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8. The amplification in the RPA reaction depends on binding of the recombinase to oligonucleotide primers. The complex then scans the template DNA for the corresponding sequence and initiates 5\u00b4-strand invasion of the oligonucleotide at the site of homology. The strand invasion is stabilized by the single strand binding protein. The extension of the primer ensues via a strand displacing DNA polymerase 6\n,\n7\n,\n8. Real-time detection is possible via an exo-probe system 5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8. In this study, MERS-CoV RT-RPA assay was developed to amplify and detect in real-time a fragment of the nucleocapsid gene (NC) of MERS-CoV.",

The lids were closed and the magnesium acetate centrifuged into the tubes using a minispin centrifuge and the tubes immediately placed into the tubescanner device (Qiagen Lake Constance, Stockach, Germany). Fluorescence measurements were performed in an ESEquant tubescanner at 42\u00b0C for 10 minutes. A combined threshold and signal slope analysis were used for signal interpretation which can be confirmed by 2nd derivative analysis (Tubescanner studio software, Qiagen Lake Constance, Stockach, Germany).",

            "text": "The run time of the RT-RPA was 10 minutes (figure 1 and 2B), and including nucleic acid extraction from samples, results can therefore be obtained in about 30 minutes. Reagents are available as dried pellets (cost 4 Euro/test) and the detection device is comparably cheap (around 4500 Euro). Rapid point-of-care diagnosis and field investigations are feasible as recent use of this technology during the FMDV outbreak in Egypt in 2012 has shown 5. We recently successfully operated a mobile RT-RPA unit consisting of a nucleic acid extraction kit, a RT-RPA kit, a pipette set, a magnetic separator, a tubescanner, and a laptop in Kedougou, Senegal using a solar panel (manuscript in preparation). The experiences made indicate that mobile RT-RPA is a very good alternative for mobile point-of-care detection, since infrastructure and equipment needs are below that of laboratory based or mobile RT-PCR 6\n,\n7\n,\n8.",

Physical stress on the pilgrims may increase the susceptibility to diseases 12 and the density of the susceptibles might therefore be conducive to transmission of MERS-CoV. Therefore, implementation of mobile RT-RPA units during the Hajj might be an easy tool to detect MERS-CoV infected cases on site to identify acute cases and prevent the spread of the virus. RT-RPA might also help to improve affordable monitoring for MERS-CoV by public health laboratories worldwide.",
