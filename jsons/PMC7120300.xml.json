Hospitalizations for asthma have clearly decreased as a result of the use of controller medications. Quality of life has been identified as a significant metric to measure asthma treatment success. On the other hand, despite our improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of asthma, newer medications with fewer adverse effects, and increased standardization of treatment protocols, there has been a paradoxical increase in asthma mortality. The reasons for this observation are debatable, but may include lifestyle changes, dietary changes, the increase in obesity rates in the Western Hemisphere, \u00adcoding anomalies, poor patient and/or caregiver education, and the \u00adoverall increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma. What is clear, however, is that the development and introduction of new pharmaceuticals is not by itself the answer to improving outcomes in children with asthma. Patient education, environmental avoidance measures, proper use of medications, and immunotherapy are all equally important in the successful treatment of the pediatric asthmatic. The good news is that with our awareness of these factors, mortality has at least stabilized over the past 5 years.",

The diagnosis of asthma in children may be difficult to make in the infant because of the prevalence of viral-associated wheezing in this age group of patients. The impact of viral illness on the development of asthma in later years is addressed later, along with the role of allergies in childhood asthma. Certain medications are not always appropriate for all ages, and devices that are used to evaluate asthma status may not be usable by young children. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is particularly important in childhood as physical activity is critical to controlling the epidemic of obesity in developed countries, especially the United States. Lifestyle changes, including the use of television, internet, and other video devices, may play a role in childhood asthma. Finally, the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d has introduced the concept that early exposure to animals, foods, or endotoxin may actually be protective against allergic sensitization. While this is still a controversial issue, it illustrates the complexity of asthma as a heterogeneous disease, with genetic and environmental influences. Indeed, we now know that there is no single asthma gene, rather that there are multiple genetic variants that, under the proper environmental conditions, can result in asthma.\n",

A good history includes current or past history of cough, wheezing, viral respiratory diseases, accompanying allergy symptoms or signs, shortness of breath, and sinus problems. The intensity and characteristics of any breathing sounds should be determined. It is also important to obtain an exposure history to attempt to clarify \u00adrelevant triggers for asthma exacerbations. This can include indoor allergen exposures, outdoor pollens, viral upper respiratory infections and exercise, exposure to foods, and an occupational history of both the child (if old enough to be working) and the parents or caregivers. Exposure to day care is also important and environmental tobacco smoke and pollution exposure should also be documented. A past medical history asking about previous hospitalizations, doctor visits, frequent otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, and a complete medication history, including use of nebulizers or inhalers and any other pertinent medications should be elicited.

Common allergens can be categorized into either indoor or outdoor allergens. The outdoor allergens are mostly linked to seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereas indoor allergens are linked to perennial allergic rhinitis. There are geographical differences in the seasonal distribution of pollen allergens. Recently, it has been suggested that climate change may be impacting the prevalence of various outdoor allergens through different mechanisms. In addition, environmental exposures and host factors can lead to changes in an individual\u2019s sensitivities throughout life.

Although these larger particles can indirectly trigger early or late phase asthma reactions by virtue of their action in the upper airways, fine and ultrafine particles present a more significant problem due to their deeper penetration into the smaller airways (7).

With proper control of asthma using controller medications, a patient with EIA can almost always participate in regular cardiovascular training without adverse effects. Asthma can even be managed successfully in the elite athlete. The severity of a patient\u2019s EIA can be evaluated using an exercise challenge test. Historically, the methodology of exercise challenge tests has been very inconsistent, but recently the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has proposed a set of criteria that should be met in order to ensure an accurate and valid test (9).

This is important because sometimes asthma treatment can be complicated for patients, and parents and patients can become overwhelmed with all the instructions about multiple medications, how to use a peak flow meter, and what to do in an emergency. The asthma action plan can also serve as a refresher course for patients, who have recently been discharged from the hospital after an admission for an asthma exacerbation. Involving schoolteachers in a child\u2019s asthma action plan can also help to improve the overall asthma control and quality of life (18).\n",

Corticosteroids work by switching off inflammatory genes through their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor and recruitment of histone deactylase-2 (HDAC-2). By regulation of transcription of inflammatory genes or their promoters, they exert a number of anti-inflammatory effects (as illustrated in Fig. 10).

Most of these have been attributed to oral or parenteral steroids. In children with asthma, the major concerns regarding inhaled or nebulized steroids have been the effect on growth (27). Studies to determine if inhaled corticosteroids indeed have such an effect are difficult to conduct because asthma itself has been associated with growth retardation (28). Results have therefore been inconsistent; however, the bulk of the evidence suggests that even if there is growth retardation, this is usually reversible, and there is a period of \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth. Moreover, even if corticosteroids do indeed affect growth, the extent of growth retardation is minimal. Thus, the risk of growth retardation is small compared to the potential for serious asthma exacerbations. Adrenal suppression in children on inhaled steroids is also not a significant problem. In a study of 14 children on a dry-powder beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler, there was no suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (29). The dose of beclomethasone was 12\u201325 \u03bcg/kg/day. Other studies have failed to demonstrate adverse effects on the HPA axis (30). On the other hand, use of high doses of fluticasone has been shown to cause HPA axis suppression (31). It is not known if there is any clinical significance to these observed effects. A list of the available inhaled corticosteroids and their daily dosing regimens in pediatrics is given in Table 11.\n\n",

The FDA originally had a warning on using antihistamines in asthma which was a class effect, so any newer antihistamines that were introduced all carried the same warning. However, while the first-generation antihistamines had side effects that could potentiate an asthma exacerbation, such as the anticholinergic effects of drying, as well as the sedative effects, the second-generation antihistamines have much less of these adverse effects and should be safe in asthmatics. They should also provide some benefit, especially in children, where the greater proportion of asthma is associated with \u00adallergies (36). The currently available second-generation antihistamines in the United States are cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratidine, desloratidine, and fexofenidine. These drugs block the allergic effect of environmental allergens, but cetirizine also inhibits leukocyte recruitment and activation and eosinophil migration (37), and has been shown to decrease late leukocyte migration into antigen-challenge skin blister fluid chambers (38). All three inflammatory cell lines, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils were affected.",

Once theophylline is started, the child should be admitted to the hospital. Each milligram per kilogram of theophylline IV bolus results in about a 2 mg/dL rise in theophylline levels. The therapeutic window of theophylline serum levels is between 10 and 20 mg/dL. Thus, a commonly used bolus of 6 mg/kg results in a level that should fall well within the therapeutic window. An intravenous theophylline drip of 0.8\u20131 mg/kg/h will result in a steady state serum level. Theophylline levels must be monitored carefully because of the serious side effects that can occur at higher serum levels (Table 10).

Treatment by a specialist leads to fewer hospitalizations, fewer exacerbations requiring emergency care, better quality of life, and better outcomes. However, the availability of financial resources, and more important, the failure to properly allocate such resources can be such an economic burden that optimal systems of healthcare are not implemented.

Future research may be able to identify which treatment might be preferred based on the patient\u2019s pharmacogenetics, but we have not yet reached this point. Environmental control has become a mainstay in asthma treatment, and new modes of immunotherapy have contributed to a significant less morbidity over the past two or three decades. Hospitalization rates of asthmatic children have decreased, drugs with high rates of side effects such as theophylline have been replaced, and quality of life has improved. Most children with asthma are able to enjoy very normal lives, compete in sports at a high level and have very few missed school or work days, as long as they are compliant with their asthma management plan.",
