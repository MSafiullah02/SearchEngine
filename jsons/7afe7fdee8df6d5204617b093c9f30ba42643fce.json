            "text": "Viruses are infectious units with diameters of about 16 nm (circoviruses) to over 300 nm (poxviruses; Table 2 .1). Their small size makes them ultrafilterable, i.e. they are not retained by bacteria-proof filters. Viruses have evolved over longtime period, and have adapted to specific organisms or their cells. The infectious virus particles, or virions, are composed of proteins and are surrounded in some species of viruses by a lipid membrane, which is referred to as an envelope; the particles contain only one kind of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Viruses do not reproduce by division, such as bacteria, yeasts or other cells, but they replicate in the living cells that they infect. In them, they develop their genomic activity and produce the components from which they are made. They encode neither their own protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) nor energy-generating metabolic pathways. Therefore, viruses are intracellular parasites. They are able to re-route and modify the course of cellular processes for the optimal execution of their own reproduction. Besides the genetic information encoding their structural components, they additionally possess genes that code for several regulatory active proteins (such as transactivators) and enzymes (e.g. proteases and polymerases). Viruses exist in different conditions. They can actively replicate in cells, and produce a great number of progeny viruses. This is known as a replicationally active state. After infection, some virus types can transition into a state of latency by integrating their genetic information into the genome of the host cell, or maintain it as an episome in an extrachromosomal status within infected cells. Certain viral genes can be transcribed during that time, contributing to the maintenance of latency (herpesviruses). In other cases, the expression of the viral genome is completely repressed over long periods of time (e.g. in some animal pathogenic retroviruses). In both cases, cellular processes or external influences can reactivate the latent genomes, leading to a new generation of infectious viruses. Depending on the virus type, the infection can have different consequences for the host cell: 1. It is destroyed and dies. 2. It survives, but continuously produces small numbers of viruses and is chronically (persistently) infected. 3. It survives and the viral genome remains in a latent state without producing infectious particles. 4. It is immortalized, thus gaining the capability of unlimited cell division, a process that can be associated with malignant transformation into a tumour cell.",

Depending on the virus type, the nucleic acid is single-stranded or double-stranded, linear, circular or segmented. Single-stranded RNA and DNA genomes can have different polarity, and in certain cases the RNA genome is similar to messenger RNA, e.g. in picornaviruses and flaviviruses. A single-stranded genome that has the same polarity as the messenger RNA is referred to as a positive or plus strand. The genome forms a nucleocapsid complex with cellular histones (polyomaviruses) or viral proteins (e.g. rhabdoviruses, paraviruses, orthomyxoviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses). This nucleic acid-protein complex can be surrounded by particular protein structures, the capsids (in polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses). In some cases (such as picornaviruses, flaviviruses, togaviruses and parvoviruses), the nucleic acid interacts directly with the capsids. In viruses containing an envelope, the capsid layer can be absent (as in coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, bunyaviruses and arenaviruses).",

In some virus types, they consist of multimeric units of only one polypeptide, in other cases they are composed of heteromeric complexes. The capsid protein subunits can aggregate into discrete subunits or even into so-called capsomeres, i.e. morphologically distinct structural components. Rod-shaped capsids have a helical symmetry. The two planes of symmetry, i.e. the longitudinal and the transversal axes, differ in length (Fig. 2.2a icosahedron with rotational symmetry whose centres of the symmetry axes are at the vertices of the icosahedron (fivefold symmetry axis) in the middle of the triangle (threefold symmetry axis) and along the edges (twofold symmetry axis). Picornaviruses, parvoviruses and adenoviruses are examples of viruses with such capsid forms a rotational symmetry; an icosahedron consists of 20 equilateral triangles and 12 vertices (Fig. 2.2b) . The symmetry axes have the same length: the fivefold symmetry axis is located at the vertices of the icosahedron; the threefold axis passes through the centre of a triangle, the twofold axis passes along the edges. The number of subunits of an icosahedron can be calculated by the formula 10 n \u00c0 1 \u00f0 \u00de 2 \u00fe 2, where n indicates the number of morphologically distinguishable structures on the face of a triangle.",

Therefore, viruses change by mutation and selection preferentially the amino acid sequences of antibody-binding regions or epitopes, which are responsible for binding neutralizing immunoglobulins. In some species of viruses, this variability of the surface regions leads to the formation new subtypes. In addition to this continuous change of the surface of exposed regions that is determined by mutation and selection, in some virus types another source of variability is possible by genetic recombination, by which even large nucleic acid regions can be exchanged between different viruses. This can lead to substantial changes in the viruses involved and to the generation of new viral species.",

Viroids are plant pathogens and consist of a circular RNA (about 200-400 nucleotides) that does not code for proteins and exhibits a complex two-dimensional structure. A central sequence motif is highly conserved and essential for replication of these nucleic acid molecules. Other regions are variable and may be responsible for virulence. These infectious RNA molecules are replicated by cellular polymerases in a rolling circle mechanism (\u25b6 Sect. 3.4), whereby secondary structures are formed at the transitions, which are known as a hammerhead because of their form. They have RNase activity, and autocatalytically cleave the concatemeric RNA strands that result after replication. Ribozymes, small RNA species with sequence-specific RNase activity (\u25b6 Sect. 9.3), are derived from the hammerhead-like RNA structures.",

These viruses were originally regarded as bacteria because of the extraordinary size of their spherical capsids (400 nm) and protein filaments, which protrude extremely from the surface, conferring the virions with an apparent size of up to 800 nm. Therefore, they were denominated \"mimiviruses\" as an abbreviation for \"mimicking viruses\". The DNA genome of mimiviruses comprises 1.2 million base pairs and encompasses more than 1,200 putative genes. Even larger mamaviruses have been discovered in amoebae, which can be infected by parasitic viruses. These significantly smaller viruses (sputnikvirus), also known as virophages, can multiply in amoebae only if they are concurrently infected by mamaviruses. However, sputniks do not use mamaviruses only as a helper virus, but also inhibit their proliferation and morphogenesis, thus making them virtually sick.",

            "text": "In animals and humans, prions always cause fatal neurodegenerative disorders. They can be transmitted within a species, and -albeit limited -to other organisms beyond species boundaries (\u25b6 Chap. 21). The pathogen responsible (prion, from \"proteinaceous infectious particle\") does not require a coding nucleic acid in the infectious agent. Prions are composed of the pathological isoform (PrP Sc ), which exists especially in b-sheet conformation, and of a non-pathological cellular prion protein (PrP C ), which is present predominantly in a-helical conformation. The conversion of the PrP C a-helical conformation into the b-sheet PrP Sc variant is associated with completely different biochemical properties, and is the key pathogenetic basic principle of prion diseases. After its synthesis, the cellular protein PrP C arrives in the cytoplasmic membrane. PrP C is active at the cell surface only for a limited time, and is subsequently degraded in the endosomes. During this process, a small proportion of PrP C proteins are constantly transformed into PrP Sc variants. This process is referred to as prion conversion. PrP Sc proteins cannot be efficiently degraded and accumulate in the cells. The function of PrP C has not been completely resolved. Experiments with knockout mice containing a deletion of the PrP coding genome sequences revealed that PrP C appears to be dispensable for development and survival of the mice. However, without PrP C they cannot develop a prion disease.",
