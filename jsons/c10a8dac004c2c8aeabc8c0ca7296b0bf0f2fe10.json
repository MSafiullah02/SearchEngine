The understanding of this process is fundamental for crafting and tailoring post-disaster relief. In this work we perform a massive data analysis, through geolocalized data from 13M Facebook users, on how such a stress affected mobility patterns in France, Italy and UK. We find that the general reduction of the overall efficiency in the network of movements is accompanied by geographical fragmentation with a massive reduction of long-range connections. The impact, however, differs among nations according to their initial mobility structure. Indeed, we find that the mobility network after the lockdown is more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more distributed in Italy. Such a process can be approximated through percolation to quantify the substantial impact of the lockdown.",

As a result, an impressive effort is being exerted to understand on one side the epidemiological features of the outbreak [5] [6] [7] [8] and on the other side its economic consequences [9] [10] [11] . The majority of countries governments have responded with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aimed at reducing the mobility of citizens to decrease the rate of contagion [12] . This calls for a better understanding of the patterns of human mobility during emergencies and in the immediate post-disaster relief. Indeed the study of mobility habits is a foundational instance for several issues ranging from traffic forecasting, up to virus spreading and urban planning [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, a quantitative assessment of its statistical properties at different geographical scales remains elusive [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The availability of rich datasets on mobility of individuals, coupled with the urgency of the current situation, has fostered the collaboration between tech giants, such as Facebook and Google, institutions and scholars [7, [22] [23] [24] . Along this path, the present work builds upon a collection of data from social network users and addresses the dynamics of spatial redistribution of individuals as a response to mobility restrictions applied to limit the disease outbreak. We perform a massive analysis on aggregated and de-identified data provided by Facebook through its Disease Prevention movement maps [25] to compare the * a.galeazzi002@unibs.it \u2020 antonio.scala.phys@gmail.com \u2021 w.quattrociocchi@unive.it effects of lockdown measures applied in France, Italy and UK in response to COVID-19. The overall dataset spans over 1 month of observations and accounts for movements of over 13M people. We model countries as networks of mobility flows and we find that restrictions elicit a transition toward local/short run connections, thus causing a loss in the network efficiency. Our result mirrors previous results in the literature which found that critical phenomena are an intrinsic feature of mobility networks, leading to transition between isolated short-range flows and collective long range flows [26] . Moreover we contribute to the literature on mobility disruption during critical events [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] by studying the effect of movement limitations across the whole territory of the countries in our dataset, with a geographic scope which is unparalleled in the literature.",

The general reduction of the overall efficiency in the network of movements is accompanied by geographical fragmentation with a massive reduction of long-range connections. However, the effect changes according to the starting mobility structure of each nation. In particular, we find that the network of UK and France after the lockdown is more concentrated while in Italy is more distributed. We conclude the paper by showing how the the effect of restrictions in Italy, UK and France can be approximated through percolation analysis. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several interesting features. First, the three countries display differentiated mobility patterns that reflect the structural diversity in their underlying infrastructure: more centralized around their capital cities in the case of France and UK and more clustered in the case of Italy. Such infrastructural characteristics, together with different responses to national lockdown, contributed to the emergence of very distinctive configurations in terms of arXiv:2005.06341v1 [cs.SI] 13 May 2020 residual mobility patterns. France has one big cluster centered in Paris and many smaller centers that disconnect as soon as the percolation process begins, Italy exhibits four interconnected clusters, centered approximately in Napoli, Roma, Milano and Torino, that remain interconnected over time thus showing a high persistence and resilience. Finally, UK has one cluster centered around London, but most of England exhibits a higher persistence with respect to France and Italy, thus suggesting the presence of a more capillary network structure.",

By comparing the mobility network during the pre-lockdown phase (panels A-B-C of Figure 1 ) to the mobility network during the post-lockdown phase, we note a significant reduction of the overall connectivity. However, we notice that mobility restrictions have a higher impact on the connectivity of France, whereas they yields more limited effects in the other two countries. In fact, UK and Italy show a reduction of 21% and 16% in the size of the largest weakly connected component (LWCC, that is, the maximal subgraph of a network in which any two vertices are interconnected through an undirected path), whereas France exhibits a reduction of almost 79%. Such different impact on the LWCC across countries may depend on several co-existing factors, among which we can list the structural features of the underlying networks and the population density, that is 199,82/km 2 for Italy, 270.7/km 2 for UK and 101/km 2 for France. In panels G-H-I of Figure 1 , we further characterize daily connectivity patterns by computing the number of weakly connected components (No. WCC) and the size of the LWCC of the mobility networks. In all cases, we observe a decreasing trend on the size of LWCC and an increase of the number of WCCs. It is worth noticing that these trends are present even before the lockdown dates, but they reach a steady state only during the days after the intervention. Hence, the number of WCCs and the size of the LWCC well capture the response of the countries to the lockdown. In the case of France (where the LWCC is Paris-centric), we notice a strong fragmentation of the network from the beginning: in fact, the number of WCCs is larger than the size of the LWCC, signaling that the mobility is well distributed along the whole country. However, Paris remains connected by long-range connections to the remaining most active areas of Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Lyon. In the case of Italy (where the LWCC contains all the main Italian cities, i.e. Napoli, Roma, Milano and Torino), the lockdown enhances the importance of local mobility. Notice that, while in the centre and the south of Italy mobility remains localised mainly at regional level (in Fig. 1E one can notice Sicilia, Campania, Lazio and Toscana), the lockdown reveals that northern Italy is more interconnected, showing a clustered mobility for the main industrial regions, i.e. Piemonte, Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. The UK is clearly London-centric: the size of the LWCC remains higher than the number of WCCs, with strong local mobility patterns only in the Bristol area and in the Manchester-Liverpool area. Hence, the situation in terms of number of WCCs and the size of the LWCC reflects the different underlying structure of the three countries: France with a huge hub in Paris that is star-connected via long-range links to the local city-centered areas, Italy with mobility distributed mostly over the center-northern region, and UK that appears as an extension of London, whose mobility network remains pervasive even after the lockdown.",

The observed trend means that the contribution of nodes to the global efficiency becomes more and more heterogeneous over time, until it reaches a steady state. This result indicates that the progressive disruption has very heterogeneous effects on the single nodes, suggesting that policies should be carefully tailored to avoid enhancing unequal treatments of different areas: as an example, in Italy it has been observed that the lockdown could enhance economic disparities [24] . Such an effect could be even more pronounced in France, that shows a higher level of dishomogeneity in connectivity both at the municipal and at the provincial level when compared to Italy. Indeed, nodes that get disconnected are more likely to remain isolated as compared to a country such as Italy that is based on a more distributed mobility network Conversely, UK seems to have a different response to the shock distributing it more evenly among its nodes (refer to SI for further details).

We assume that such a graph is a proxy for the structure of the mobility network in standard conditions (see Materials and Methods). We implement bond percolation on the aggregated networks by iteratively deleting edges following an increasing (respectively decreasing) weight order. During the process of network dismantling, we keep track of measures related to both cohesiveness and distance, namely the LWCC size, the global efficiency and the node persistence.

Percolation process is performed by iterating a cutting procedure on edges according to their weights calculated in the whole period before lockdown. Top panels: node persistence during the percolation process. Node persistence is defined as the number of iterations a node remains connected to the LWCC over the maximum number of iterations before the network is completely disconnected; the more persistent the node, the brighter the color. Notice that we are defining persistence upon deleting edges by their increasing strength: hence, brighter nodes are not only the last to be disconnected, but are also those embedded in stronger mobility flows.

France displays the lowest percentage of residual edges, while Italy and UK tend to retain a higher percentage of their edges. Moreover, we notice how Italy and UK strongly differ in terms of the evolution of LWCC size: although they loose roughly the same fraction of edges, there is a strong difference in terms of the amount of connected nodes. In spite of such differences, the increasing percolation strategy is able to approximate the reduction in terms LWCC size quite accurately for all nations. The case of the normalized global efficiency is somewhat different: all the countries seems to have a similar loss proportionally to their initial efficiency. Additionally, the trend of the empirical curves is closer to that of the decreasing percolation strategy. The major difference observed in the middle and bottom rows of Figure 3 is based on the fact that the considered empirical statistics follow opposite link removal strategies. This effect is due in part to the nature of the two measures; the former more related to the density and to the structure of connections and the second more related to their weight. In any case, despite eventual differences related to the network measures that we take into into account, it is interesting to observe how the lockdown cannot be modeled by a removal strategy based only on edge weights. Rather, it is the result of a joint effect deriving from the removal of links based both on their structural importance and weight.",

Most national governments have simultaneously reacted to the contagion by applying mobility restrictions to contain the disease outbreak. The resulting disruption is similar to that caused by a natural disaster, but the effect is on a global scale. For this reason, in this work we analyze the effects of the lockdown on three different national mobility systems, the French, Italian and British, by means of a 13M users dataset from Facebook. We provide a structural analysis of the mobility network for each nation and quantify the effect of mobility restrictions applied to hinder COVID-19 outbreak by means of percolation analysis. We find that lockdown mainly affects national smallwordness i.e., strong reduction of long-range connections in favor of local paths. Our analysis suggests that the national resilience to massive stress differs and depends upon the inner connectivity structure. Indeed, the three countries display very different mobility patterns that reflect the diversity in their underlying infrastructure, more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more distributed in the case of Italy. Our results may provide insights on the interplay between mobility patterns and structural dependencies in the network of movements at national level and may help design better transportation networks, improve system efficiency during natural catastrophes and contain epidemics spreading.",
