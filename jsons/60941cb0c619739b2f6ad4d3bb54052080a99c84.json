            "text": "Use of polypills combining multiple pharmacotherapies for cardiovascular disease prevention is a hot topic in cardiovascular medicine. In a low-resource, mostly black community in Alabama with average 12% 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, a pill combining a statin plus three blood pressure-lowering medications improved adherence and control of proximal risk factors. 1 In Iran, a combination of aspirin, a statin and two anti-hypertensive drugs reduced cardiovascular disease events in a mixed primary/secondary prevention population including 11% individuals with established cardiovascular disease and 15% with diabetes, as compared to a \"minimal care\" intervention. 2 These findings have re-sparked interest in scaling-up the use of polypills for cardiovascular prevention, from individual high-risk patients to entire populations at heterogeneous risk-the so-called polypill paradigm for population-level cardiovascular disease prevention. 3, 4 This was first proposed by Wald and Law in 2003, who projected that a pill combining six drugs could reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease up to 80% in the UK. 5 Multiple concerns were subsequently raised including ethics issues, medicalization of prevention, potential for overtreatment of mostly low-risk individuals, pharmacological side effects, and costs. A few years later, Bittencourt and colleagues demonstrated that implementation of the inclusion criteria of initial polypill population-level trials would define target populations comprising a majority of individuals unlikely to derive benefit. 6 More recently, this paradigm has evolved to focus on \"underserved populations\", i.e., low-resource communities with poor access to healthcare which typically face higher rates of cardiovascular disease than those with more resources. The assumption is that treating the entire 4 population of underserved communities with polypills could markedly curtail their rates of cardiovascular disease, potentially reducing disparities. This has been followed by a call for additional trials comparing population-level polypill-based interventions to more \"precise\" approaches. 4, 7 In our opinion, use of pills combining various pharmacotherapies represents a promising approach with enormous potential to improve adherence and clinical outcomes in patients who require such medications. On the other hand, although we welcome any efforts aimed at improving the cardiovascular health of low-resource communities through interventions with the potential to improve equity, important conceptual issues arise when evaluating a population-level polypill paradigm for cardiovascular disease prevention. Importantly, although this approach is often confronted by precision medicine as its most intuitive counterargument, 7 we pose that a social epidemiology perspective should also be brought into the conversation to fully characterize its strengths and weaknesses.",

Rose did not dismiss individuallevel approaches, but rather emphasized that their main benefit is on treating higher-risk individuals in whom the benefits outweigh the risks. 8 On the other hand, from a population standpoint, the high-risk approach is akin to famine relief, which feeds the hungry in the short term but does not tackle the underlying causes, which persist: \"success is only palliative and temporary\". 8 Third, in tackling the high burden of cardiovascular disease in underserved populations, there is indeed a need to consider the underlying fundamental causes and their connection with other adverse health outcomes that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status, as this may be crucial to identify the most impactful and cost-effective interventions ( Figure) . The association between poverty and these outcomes occurs through a variety of pathways and ultimately yields a markedly reduced quality of life and life expectancy.",

Conversely, cardiovascular disease has well-established proximal risk factors and upwards determinants, most of which are addressable.

For the same reason, should we devote millions 7 of dollars to evaluate/implement large-scale pharmacological-based prevention approaches, or should those resources be invested in improving basic life conditions and access to care among underserved areas?
