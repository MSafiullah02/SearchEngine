Such a unified framework will assist in improving the quality and consistency of reported information on public health activity, performance, investment and expenditure. The National Public Health Partnership funded the project in response to recommendations from the 2002 Public Health Performance Project. 1 During the early scoping stages of the Public Health Classifications Project, it became apparent that a simple, one-dimensional classification system for public health could not satisfy the needs, or reflect the diverse world-views, of its disparate potential users. To provide a single 'unified framework' for multiple public health uses, a multi-dimensional classification was needed.",

The starting point for identifying public health issues, problems and priorities, and for designing and implementing interventions, is the population as a whole, or population subgroups. 3 The boundary between public health and clinical practice came up repeatedly as an issue in discussions about the scope of public health, with particular debate about whether preventive services delivered on a one-to-one basis to individuals should be considered in scope. Many agreed that immunisation was in scope because it is an activity that is 'organised' at a population level with benefits for both populations and individuals. More contentious, however, was the possible inclusion of interventions that are designed to prevent and manage chronic diseases, and that are delivered to individuals in primary care settings.",

For example, helping people to quit smoking would be considered a public health activity when they are symptom free, but part of clinical medicine if they have any symptoms or signs of disease or a history of previously diagnosed disease.

In Australia, the essential importance and defining nature of inter-departmental, inter-governmental, inter-sectoral and other partnerships, in the work of public health was made clear in the expert consultations. Accordingly, version one of a public health classification proposes 'build public health partnerships' as a subclass of the 'ensure public health capability' instrumental function (see Table 3 ). 53 Dimensions used by the OECD are: population groups, service types, disease types, and settings. 54 A recent review conducted by WHO (2003), describes comparable 'essential public health functions' as 'a set of fundamental activities that address the determinants of health, protect a population's health, and treat disease... public health functions represent public goods, and... governments would need to ensure the provision of these essential functions, but would not necessarily have to implement and finance them. They prevent and manage the major contributors to the burden of disease by using effective technical, legislative, administrative, and behaviour-modifying interventions or deterrents, and thereby provide an approach for intersectoral action for health [that] stresses the importance of numerous different public health partners. Moreover, the need for flexible, competent state institutions to oversee these cost-effective initiatives suggests that the institutional capacity of states must be reinforced' (Yach 1996 cited in WHO 2003 : 1, our italics). 55 The full description of this function is 'Creating and sustaining cross-Government and intersectoral partnerships to improve health and reduce inequalities' (CMO UK 2003; see chapter 3). The UK core functions also include a specific (instrumental) research function. In Australia, although 'public health research' is one of the nine core public health activities for which public health expenditure is reported, 56 there is no corresponding function in the NPHP public health core functions.

The 'methods' class, in particular, established to describe the methods of public health intervention, is at an early stage of development. While population groups are important, it was generally agreed that they are not a toplevel class in a public health classification. As the targets of public health interventions, instances of population groups can be described by other classes in the classification, such as the person-level demographic descriptors in the 'determinants of health' class (e.g. age, sex). There was also agreement that stakeholders and partners, although important in the work of public health, did not warrant their own top-level class. As with population groups, they may also be described by other classes in the classification. This distinction is illustrated in Figure 7 , which distinguishes between classes in the classification (circles) and items to be classified (heptagons). The latter include (but are not restricted to) public health activities and programs (centre), public health interventions, public policies, outcomes (indicators that are useful for public health purposes, and those that are nationally reported), population groups, partners and stakeholders in the public health effort. Figure 7 also shows whether suitable classifications exist for use by the top-level classes, or whether they need to be developed. Existing classifications (e.g. Australian standards, international classifications of diseases, functioning and disability, external causes of injury) are available to classify major parts of the 'health issues', 'settings' and 'resources' classes.

The starting point for identifying public health issues, problems and priorities, and for designing and implementing interventions, is the population as a whole, or population sub-groups. An alternative definition 'Public health activities aim to benefit populations and tend to emphasise prevention, protection and health promotion as distinct from treatment and other interventions that are tailored to individuals' (AIHW 2004, revised) was discussed but not agreed. The inclusion of a specific reference to measuring or achieving outcomes was considered implicit in the Partnership definition (above).Key points in the discussion (detailed below) included whether treatment of individuals should be included, differences in individual health versus public health benefit, and whether the definition should be inclusive or exclusive.Potential boundaries around treatment and diagnosis were raised. It was suggested but not agreed, that only treatment of asymptomatic (including undiagnosed) individuals should be included in the definition of public health, with the underpinning concept of delivery at population (rather than individual) level. The rebuttal example of public health activities in drug and alcohol treatments of individuals which also led to population or social good (eg 'harm minimisation') was acknowledged.'[T]he starting point for identifying public health issues ...' was discussed as meaning the initial conceptualisation of public health (e.g. design of SNAP [smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity] population treatment guidelines for GPs 80 ). There is no clear boundary at the top level between public health benefit and individual health benefit, and there are crossover benefits between individuals and populations in many public health areas, e.g. immunisation for communicable diseases protects the individual and contributes to population ('herd') immunity; SNAP guidelines prepared from a population health perspective are used by GPs to treat individuals. It was agreed that public health delivery, and outcome, can be at individual as well as population levels.",

An ontology is an explicit formal specification of the concepts in a domain (in this case, public health), their attributes and the relations among them, which allows people to share a common understanding of the structure of information. 82 It defines a common vocabulary for people who need to share information, and can be used to produce machine-readable definitions of the basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. Ontologies are becoming widely used in Web-based applications, to make existing information more available and better connected.A major reason for developing a public health classification as an ontology is to exploit the near future capabilities of this connectedness on the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is the enhancement occurring now, of the World Wide Web into 'a global database', with infrastructure that allows machines as well as humans to process meaningful information. 83 Ontologies have the facility to produce machine-readable data that includes both the structure and the information classified by it, while the Web infrastructure means information need no longer be held centrally to be centrally accessible.Ontologies can be developed in a top down, or bottom up manner, or using a combination of both. There is 'no correct way to model a domain -there are always viable alternatives' and ontology development is 'necessarily an iterative process'. Practical applications and discussions with content experts are used to 'evaluate and debug', leading to revisions of the 82 Noy & McGuinness 2001 . For more information on ontologies and the Semantic Web developments, see the Glossary. 83 The Semantic Web and computable information are the visions of Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web (familiar to us through search engines like Google). The future Web is viewed as a web of data, 'like a global database', where information has 'well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation'. Making information on the Web 'semantic' (meaningful) means more efficient searching as if it is 'one giant database, rather than one giant book' (Berners-Lee 1998). Semantic Web infrastructure will allow machines as well as humans to make deductions and organise information. The approach is to develop languages that express information in machine processable forms. Architectural components include semantics (meaning of elements), structure (organisation of elements), and syntax (communication). Abstract representation of data is based on existing standards (eg RDF -Resource Description Framework) and standards yet to be defined, in development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) collaborating with researchers and industrial partners.
