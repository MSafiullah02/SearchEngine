Despite promotion of FLS with a best practice framework by the International Osteoporosis Foundation [6, 9] and advocacy by Osteoporosis Canada [7], implementation of a coordinator-based post-fracture model of care is not without barriers. Implementing change can be difficult. Implementation outcomes serve as indicators of implementation success and, when implementation is successful, are the effects of purposeful and deliberate actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services [10]. When a newly implemented healthcare innovation fails to achieve the expected benefits, it is often attributable to ineffective implementation rather than issue with the innovation itself [11]. Challenges can emerge from individual and organizational factors and obstacles in the local environment [11\u201313]. Therefore, understanding the context in which implementation occurs can shed light on the implementation outcomes.",

In brief, the FLS identified patients age 50 or older with a hip fracture within the hospital setting, commenced appropriate osteoporosis care, bridged the acute-to-post-acute period and the return to pre-fracture living environment, and, finally, transitioned care back to the family physician. The FLS utilized the expertise and continuity of clinical nurses and a physician at each site to serve as a common source of information and connection to the healthcare system, with the clinical nurses following patients for 1-year following the hip fracture. In advance of broader service rollout, we assessed the 2 early adopter sites to understand the context in which the FLS was implemented, including readiness to implement change as well as facilitators and barriers to implementation, to inform its potential spread provincially (Fig. 1).",

Interested participants contacted the research team by telephone or email with questions and to arrange participation. Participants were invited to participate in telephone interviews at 2 time points: at baseline during the initial implementation phase and at approximately 16 months post-implementation. In addition, participants were asked to identify other individuals with knowledge of the FLS; newly identified individuals were invited to participate in the study using the same strategy outlined above. Lastly, individuals at the site level who participated in baseline interviews were invited to complete the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) tool [13]. ORIC is a 10-item tool which measures readiness for change on a 5-point Likert scale and includes the sub-domains of change commitment and change efficacy. Participants received the ORIC questionnaire by email following their baseline interview, with instructions to complete and return the questionnaire.",

We conducted data collection and analysis until thematic (and role) saturation was achieved [18] as was appropriate based on the design and objective of the study [19]. Qualitative data were managed and analyzed using ATLAS.ti Version 7 [20]. Descriptive statistics were conducted for the ORIC questionnaire, with data entered and managed using SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 25 [21]. Total and sub-scale scores were calculated by the sum across items. Guided by the questionnaire response scale anchors, we categorized participant scores as low (10\u201329), neutral (30\u201339), or high (40\u201350), with higher scores representing more favorable Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change through the FLS. We implemented several strategies throughout the research process to ensure rigor including methodological coherence [22], peer debriefing [23], and maintaining an audit trail [23]. In addition, we synthesized and presented the findings using thematic statements, which is a strategy to make findings clear and actionable. [24]",

This included demonstrating the need or value of the service, providing the necessary resources to implement it, and selecting appropriate sites. Demonstrating the need for or value of the FLS involved communicating the benefits of the service for patients and/or healthcare providers. One participant commented on communicating the value of FLS,I think if you are able to convey the need and provide the evidence and help people understand there a significant care gap. Even though this is an additional program and additional step\u2026people are willing to come on board and be enthusiastic to support the program (Site 2, Participant 3).In addition, many participants indicated at baseline that the target patient population (i.e., hip fracture patients and/or seniors) had become a priority (e.g., identified by the BJH SCN and ABJHI as a priority, identified by AHS as a care gap in osteoporosis, and the introduction of senior-friendly initiatives). Another important strategy was providing the resources (i.e., human and/or financial) needed to implement the FLS, thereby not increasing the existing workload of others. Participants commented on the need to be mindful of staff workloads with comments such as,I don\u2019t think that the FLS is adding on to anyone else\u2019s workload. If anything I think it\u2019s helping other people\u2019s work load so I think that\u2019s a key thing with this initiative, we\u2019re not piling anything onto anyone else (Site 1, Participant 1).It\u2019s a fairly non-invasive program. It\u2019s not one that demands a lot of buy in or extra work from the staff on the ground level (Site 2, Participant 8).However, some participants reported some role confusion at baseline, such as concerns over duplication of services or territorial issues. In addition, there were some concerns regarding the workload and coverage for the FLS physician and clinical nurse. Finally, appropriate site selection appeared to have been another important strategy used in implementing the FLS. This included partnering with sites with high change commitment and change efficacy as demonstrated by their ORIC scores, where participants scored their sites\u2019 readiness to implement change as high (71%) or neutral (29%) at baseline, and as reported by participants during interviews. For example, participants described the people or sites involved as \u201cearly adopters\u201d or as having a culture open to change. In speaking of the culture of openness to new ideas, one participant described the site as follows,It\u2019s the people. The administration team at the [site] was all for it. Let\u2019s go for it\u2026. it\u2019s just a group that\u2019s open and willing to look at something or introduce something or participate in something when they know it could be of benefit to the patient (Site 2, Participant 7).Commitment to the patient population or content area was also identified as a facilitator to successful implementation, as was the importance of having champions of the service to support communication and implementation, as well as having learned from previous experiences with change and applying those learnings to the implementation of the FLS. In the following quotation, a participant described the learning process,It's been foundational to how FLS has been designed from the get go. We\u2019ve borrowed very heavily from past experience on implementing the [care pathway] and implementing [2i model for secondary fracture prevention]. All of these programs have influenced how we designed and rolled out the FLS right from site selection to the fact that we\u2019re doing a staged roll out, through to how we communicate, how we engage with our stakeholders, or how we even organized the content development and delivery of this program (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2).Of note, several participants described change fatigue independent of the FLS, including the introduction of several pilot programs and/or new initiatives related to the hip fracture patient population over a relatively short period of time. Regardless of the amount of change experienced, participants did not believe that change fatigue was/would be a barrier to implementing the FLS, often citing the strategies outlined above as the rationale for this opinion. The following participant commented,In AHS, we are used to change so I don\u2019t think it would have much of an influence. I think people would be accepting of a new service like FLS (Site 2, Participant 4).",

That is, they had a clear understanding of its intent, believed it was aligned with organizational values, and appreciated that it was evidence-based but tailored to their local context. Participants described a clear and consistent understanding of the intent of the FLS related to the 3i model of \u201cIdentify\u201d eligible patients, \u201cInvestigate,\u201d and \u201cInitiate\u201d treatment, mainly medication, with the purpose of secondary prevention of fractures or falls or to bridge a care gap. In addition, many participants identified the transition of patients back to primary care, including sharing clinical information, as a key part of the FLS. In describing the letter sent to the primary care physician of FLS patients, this participant identifies communication of the occurrence of a fracture and the tests and treatments initiated as being of potential benefit to the patient\u2019s continuing care,And then in respect to communications with transitions, the FLS does provide communications to the family physicians which I would think that they would appreciate it. I think sometimes they are surprised to hear that their patient has been in the hospital with a hip fracture, that they find out months later and then are kind of left wondering what to do. And here we are sending them a letter saying, \u201cyour patient has had a hip fracture and this is some of the things that we\u2019ve done\u2026 we\u2019ve started this medication, we\u2019re doing these investigations\u201d, to help them out because they may not often be comfortable with orthopedic care or osteoporosis management (Site 1, Participant 1).Of note, several participants indicated that the scope of the FLS was either intended to move beyond or had expanded beyond the 3i model, with a focus on medication initiation, to include identification of geriatric syndromes or issues (e.g., fall risk, urinary incontinence, dementia, and swallowing dysfunctions) with referral (or triage or red flagging) to additional services (e.g., geriatric unit in hospital or community, fall prevention program in community, home care, or osteoporosis clinics). The following participant described the broader focus,We decided to make ours a little bit broader in the sense that we didn\u2019t want it just to be a medication type program. We also wanted to include some aspects of geriatric care because of the model that we developed and we were using care of the elderly physicians. So that was another piece to it. So we expanded the scope to include having physicians to start to identify those underlined geriatric syndromes that may be contributing to the fall initially. And then we also obviously deal with the osteoporosis medication and treatment piece of it but there is that added geriatric component (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 1).",

We are also having to be patient centered, so giving them the options with the risks and benefits and then respecting whichever choice they choose to make (Site 1, Participant 4).We are very collaborative multidisciplinary team including rehab, PT [Physical Therapy], OT [Occupational Therapy], the transition coordinator, pharmacy, the clinical associate/physician, and our FLS [clinical nurse]. We work together collaboratively to try to make sure that we are placing not just fractured hip patients but all of our patients on the right [path of care] (Site 1, Participant 9).Lastly, participants appreciated that the FLS was evidence based and/or informed by Alberta-based experts,The evidence base for this program is very strong. We are not testing an unproven method here. We\u2019re actually applying strong evidence that we know works. So this is one of those few areas in health care where there\u2019s not a lot of controversy and not a lot of dispute over the value of this program. That\u2019s a very unique situation. Most of our programs, they\u2019re far greyer in terms of the economic and quality of impact on health service delivery. Here we\u2019ve got pretty cut and dried strong evidence based, a lot of that evidence also is made in Alberta. We\u2019ve got lots of research history in this area here in Alberta (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 2).Further, participants appreciated that they were able to build from the evidence base for the service but that they were able to tailor implementation of the service to the site-level context, and recommended this approach to the spread of the FLS service to future sites within the province. The following participant quotation describes the approach taken to tailor implementation,A little bit of negotiation, in terms of \u201chere's what we're doing, how does it fit into your model?\u201d Because, you know, each of the sites is different\u2026I really relied on those site leads to tell me what makes sense at their hospital site (Provincial Stakeholder, Participant 1).",

Participants reported a willingness of people to share, accept, and apply lessons learned about the FLS during its implementation, particularly from the first early adopter site to the second site that was afforded by the staggered implementation timing. One participant spoke of the value of being able to draw on the experience of the team at the first beta site,She\u2019s [the FLS Nurse at the first beta site] hugely supportive and had lots of really good tips for me for when I started. And when I started I could call her and say, \u201cAh, what do you do for this or that\u201d and so lots of support that way (Site 2, Participant 5).",

In addition, a few participants reported the establishment of a provincial steering committee to facilitate learning throughout the life of the service, beyond merely ensuring implementation unfolded as intended. One participant commented on the benefits of the steering committee as including peer sharing and the opportunity to discuss standardization,There\u2019s now been developed an FLS committee province-wide. So now we have other peers to run through decision-making with, and there are lots of decisions where we decide, okay, we\u2019re going to make this standardized between the teams. So that helps, having colleagues. Also, some of the local resources for osteoporosis care, but it\u2019s hard to program, like, the nuts and bolts (Site 1, Participant 3).Other participants commented that activities of the steering committee could include the following: the development of an orientation and training program (e.g., trainers and materials developed/formalized); providing shadowing opportunities with an FLS clinical nurse, a toolkit for processes, and a list of physical/equipment requirements (e.g., office space, fax machine); and database training.

Adaptation of the FLS to the local context was identified by Osteoporosis Canada as a strategy for the implementation of FLS [7]. The ability to fine-tune the FLS was facilitated by the learning orientation of the early adopter sites, which has been identified as an antecedent for implementation effectiveness [11]. The willingness to learn from the experience of others allowed sites to reflect on what had been done elsewhere and the potential suitability for their site. Teams actively participated in sharing their experiences and accepting suggestions from others. This transferability of learnings from elsewhere positively contributed to the context in which the FLS was implemented. The continued facilitation of a culture of learning will be essential to the successful spread of the FLS, and potentially other interventions for this patient population, provincially.",
