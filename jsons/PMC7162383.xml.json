            "text": "Before continuing, it is useful to provide clarification of certain terminology. Immunosuppression, immunodeficiency, and immunocompromised are nonquantitative terms that reflect a reduced capacity of the immune system to respond to antigens, and the terms are often used interchangeably in immunotoxicology. For the purpose of risk assessment, immunosuppression can be defined as a loss in the ability of the immune system to respond to a challenge from a level considered normal, regardless of whether clinical disease ensues. Immunodeficiency often represents an alteration in the immune system that can potentially lead to clinical disease, whether primary (i.e., genetic etiology) or secondary (epigenetic) in nature. The term, immunocompromised, like immunosuppression, indicates a deficient immune response, independent of whether or not it is maladaptive. Immunotoxicity encompasses each of these terms, but it specifies that the effect on the immune system originates from xenobiotic exposure.",

            "text": "While both infectious and neoplastic diseases are associated with secondary immunodeficiency, infectious diseases are often the focus of epidemiological studies as neoplastic diseases usually have such a long latency period. The particular microorganism responsible for an infection may assist in identifying the qualitative and quantitative nature of the immunodeficiency. For example, extracellular pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza, multiply only outside phagocytic cells and, thus, produce disease only when they can resist phagocytosis. Facultative intracellular pathogens, (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), are generally phagocytized but resist intracellular killing. Thus, infections with extracellular or facultative intracellular organisms are more frequent in individuals with impaired phagocytic mechanisms, (e.g., neutropenia), or when humoral immune deficiencies are present. Obligate intracellular pathogens, which include all viruses, cannot multiply unless they are within a host cell and are more commonly observed in individuals with defects in cellular immunity.",

Common pathogens occur in the general population at frequencies associated with their infectious nature (e.g., virulence, ease of transmission), as represented by viruses that cause influenza infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target for common pathogens, as it is directly exposed to the external environment and has a large surface area: four times the combined total surface area of the gastrointestinal tract and skin (Gardner, 2001). Upper\u2010respiratory infections occur in all age groups but produce the most severe effects in the very young and very old due to their lesser immunocompetency. Although influenza is responsible for more morbidity and mortality than any other infectious agent in recorded history (Patriarca, 1994), the low individual rates of infections in the general population (only one or two episodes in an individual per year), combined with underreporting, make it difficult to detect changes in infection rates in most epidemiological studies.",

In the case of members of the herpes virus family, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV), the virus remains in the tissue in a latent form following primary infection for the duration of the host's life. In healthy individuals, the immune system maintains viral latency, with cellular immunity playing a major role. When the cellular immune response is compromised, viral replication can ensue and potentially cause severe complications or death. Preceding viral activation, a vigorous immune response to viral\u2010specific antigens occurs in response to replication. As will be discussed later, changes in virus\u2010specific immune response or activation of latent viruses has been observed in individuals with secondary immunodeficiency disorders where mild\u2010to\u2010moderate immunosuppression may exist.",

In contrast to cancers of internal organs, in particular those in the lung and liver, which are often induced by chemical carcinogens, virus\u2010induced cancers are more immunogenic and, thus, more likely influenced by immunological factors. Suppression of cell\u2010mediated immunity has been associated with higher incidences of skin cancers, leukemias, and lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma and EBV\u2010associated B cell lymphomas are associated with severe immunosuppression as seen in patients with AIDS. Natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to play a role in resisting the progression and metastatic spread of tumors once they develop, rather than preventing initiation (Herberman, 2001). Unexpectedly, studies of individuals with NK cell deficiency states, most of which are associated with single gene mutations, have helped identify a role for NK cells in defense against human infectious disease. A resounding theme of NK cell deficiencies is susceptibility to herpes viruses, suggesting that unexplained severe herpes viral infection should raise the possibility of an NK cell deficit (Orange, 2002).",

Clinical studies offer advantages in that exposure parameters of interest can often be controlled (e.g., chamber studies of inhaled toxicants, challenge studies of adenovirus infection), and outcomes can be prospectively monitored. There are also disadvantages, as ethical considerations provide little opportunity for exposure with toxic chemicals. Furthermore, studies with extensive biological monitoring and functional immune tests can be expensive, and exposures as well as outcomes of interest may be difficult to study in the available time frame as study participants are not typically available for long\u2010term exposures or extended follow\u2010up. For the purpose of obtaining data for immunotoxicological risk assessment, clinical studies are particularly useful as they can provide data on the frequency of infections or the level of immune response to vaccines. Variations on this type of study design might include follow\u2010up of patient populations administered immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., transplant patients), that, as described below, may also have many of the characteristics of observational studies.",

The initial means of control in observational studies is introduced through the study design and the quality and validity of results can be greatly affected by the methods used to select the study sample and the rigor with which exposures and outcomes are measured. In addition to high costs, observational studies are challenging for many reasons, including potential confounding by host (age, gender, and lifestyle) and environmental (frequency of exposure to chemicals and infectious agents) factors. A secondary measure of control in observational studies is through the use of multivariable analysis techniques (e.g., regression modeling), providing there is sufficient sample size and information on potential confounders. Overall, well\u2010designed epidemiological studies (e.g., absence of selection bias, exposure or outcome misclassification, control of confounding factors) can contribute valuable information to the assessment of risk due to immunotoxic exposures.",

Although in some instances body burdens of chemicals have been determined, drawing broadly applicable conclusions from some of these studies is difficult. This is because subjects may have been exposed to chemicals other than those specifically addressed by the study, and characterization of chemical exposure may rely on subject recall or rough estimates of the duration and intensity of exposure. Furthermore, in contrast to experimental animals, functional assessment is considerably more difficult in humans as it requires antigen challenge, which involves some risk to the individual. When such studies have been undertaken, subjects have been provided commercial vaccines, such as hepatitis antigen (Weisglas\u2010Kuperus et al., 2000; van Loveren et al., 2001; Yucesoy et al., 2001; Sleijffers et al., 2003). The cellular and humoral immune response to vaccination is thought to be a sensitive indicator of immunosuppression (Glaser et al., 1993) and can reflect susceptibility to infectious disease (Deseda\u2010Tous et al., 1978; van Loveren et al., 2001). In most epidemiological studies, testing in humans has been limited to blood collection where peripheral cell counts and differentials, immunoglobulin levels, or immunophenotyping are performed. While certainly of value, it is generally agreed these are not highly sensitive indicators of immunosuppression, making it difficult to detect low\u2010to\u2010moderate levels of immunosuppression (ITC, 1999).",

Some of the more complete immunotoxicology studies have focused on persistent organochlorine compounds formerly found in pesticides and industrial chemicals\u2014e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)\u2014in children following prenatal or perinatal exposure via maternal diet and breast milk. Accidental exposures of populations in Japan (Yusho) and China (Yu\u2010Cheng) suggest an association of PCBs, their thermal breakdown products (quaterphenyls), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, found in contaminated rice oil, with immune abnormalities and increased infections. Children born to exposed mothers between 1978 and 1987 in the Yu\u2010Cheng population had lower levels of serum IgA and IgM, and a higher frequency of respiratory infections and otitis media compared to matched unexposed controls (Lu and Wu, 1985; Nakanishi et al., 1985; Yu et al., 1998).",

A study of 343 children in the United States (Michigan) showed no general association between organochlorine levels and prevalence of infections, but there was a positive association between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and DDE (the primary metabolite of DDT), or PCBs and hexachlorobenzene with otitis media (Karmaus et al., 2001). In a study of Inuit infants in Arctic Quebec, Canada (Dewailly et al., 2000), the relative risk of recurrent episodes (at least three per year) of otitis media was higher in breast\u2010fed infants in the second and third highest percentile of organochlorines exposure, compared to the lowest. At three months of age, breast\u2010fed infants with higher exposure levels had lower numbers of white blood cells and lymphocytes, and lower serum IgA levels at ages 7 and 12 months, compared to bottle\u2010fed infants. In Dutch preschool children (Weisglas\u2010Kuperus et al., 2000), PCB levels in breast milk (nonortho and planar PCBs) were also associated with increased recurrent otitis media and other symptoms of respiratory infection. In this sample, the body burden of PCBs at age 42 months was associated with higher prevalence of recurrent otitis media and chicken pox. PCB body burden was not associated with differences in lymphocyte markers outside the normal range for age\u2010matched children, although levels in breast milk and cord blood were positively correlated with lymphocyte counts and various T\u2010cell subsets. While these findings linking otitis media with PCB exposure are consistent across three studies, it was not possible to determine whether the changes in immune parameters mediated this association or simply represented parallel findings.",

Although some studies have described associations between pesticide exposure, altered immune function, and increased rates of infection, sample sizes were generally small and, in some cases, patients were self\u2010selected based on symptoms rather than exposure. Furthermore, the frequency of infections was typically estimated by recall over several years and immune function data were scarce. Not all studies suffer from these shortcomings. For example, a relatively large (n = 1600) and well\u2010defined population living in and around Aberdeen, North Carolina, near a pesticide dump site (a priority Superfund site containing organochlorine pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and metals), was evaluated for immune function and frequency of viral infections. Compared to a neighboring community, residents of Aberdeen, ages 18 to 40, were found to have higher incidence of herpes zoster (reactivated herpes infection causing shingles), but no difference in the frequency of other infectious diseases (Arndt et al., 1999). In a substudy of 302 individuals, those living in Aberdeen had significantly higher age\u2010adjusted levels of plasma DDE than those living in neighboring communities. Furthermore, higher levels of plasma DDE were related to lower lymphocyte responses to mitogens but higher absolute lymphocyte counts and IgA levels (Vine et al., 2001). In a separate analysis, residents living nearer to the pesticide dump site had both a lower lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation and a greater likelihood of having a lower percentage of CD16+ (NK) cells, (<8%, the lower limit of the normal reference range; Vine et al., 2000). The association seen with reactivated herpes infection is plausible in light of these changes, given that NK cells play an important role in the generation of cytotoxic T\u2010cells required to help control viral infections. These studies illustrate several challenges in demonstrating the effects of chemical exposures in a population\u2010based setting. Although an infectious outcome (zoster) was associated with residential history of chemical exposure in Aberdeen, suggesting immunosuppression related to proximity to the dump sites, the more extensive and expensive immune markers and serum indicators of exposure were only examined in a small subset of the original sample. Thus, it was not possible to further examine potential pathways leading to the association with zoster.",

As recently reviewed by Antonini et al.

For example, in a study that followed 100 members of 16 families for 1 year, infections were four times more likely to occur following a family\u2010related stress event than if no stress event occurred (Meyer and Haggerty, 1962). In a prospective cohort study, 246 individuals from 58 families were followed for the effects of family functioning and stress on the incidence of influenza infection (Clover et al., 1989). Examinations \u223c2 weeks after an influenza epidemic ended showed that infection was negatively associated with both cohesion and adaptability. In a study where humans were challenged with an infectious agent, 394 healthy subjects were assessed for psychological stress and subsequently administered nasal droplets containing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or coronavirus (Cohen et al., 1991). The rate of respiratory infections (p < 0.005) and clinical colds (p < 0.02), as determined by virus\u2010specific antibody levels and viral isolation, increased in a dose\u2010responsive manner with increasing degrees of psychological stress (Fig. 2). Although usually conducted in small cohorts, immune testing in chronically stressed individuals has provided some insights into the relationship between mild\u2010to\u2010moderate immunosuppression and disease (Kiecolt\u2010Glaser et al., 1986, 1987). In chronic stress groups showing an increased rate of infections, total circulating T cell numbers can be reduced to as much as 20% below control values, while the number of circulating B cells remain unaffected. Furthermore, CD4:CD8 ratios, while usually within normally reported ranges, can be reduced as much as 40% and NK cell activity by 10% to 25% below control values. Measurement of mitogen\u2010stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation, although not generally considered a sensitive indicator for immune function, was reduced in the stressed population by \u223c10% from control values.

An increase in specific antibody titers to latent viruses (i.e., seroconversion), which reflects viral activation and replication, precedes disease onset, although only \u223c20% of seroconverters actually develop clinical manifestations. Studies have also been conducted to examine associations between psychological stress and the immune response following hepatitis B, influenza virus, or pneumococcal vaccination, (reviewed in Kiecolt\u2010Glaser et al., 2002). In studies of students under defined academic stress, the ability to seroconvert following first and second immunizations with hepatitis B vaccine were highly associated with tests to measure stress levels. In studies involving influenza vaccinations, Alzheimer's disease caregivers responded less favorably to vaccination, with only 12 (38%) compared to 21 controls (66%) showing a 4\u2010fold increase in antibody titer following immunization. A four\u2010fold increase is considered an adequate response (Kiecolt\u2010Glaser et al., 1996).

A smaller but more detailed study by Storek et al. (1997), evaluating 29 patients for 180 days preceding the 1\u2010year post\u2010transplant exam, showed a highly significant inverse correlation (P = 0.005 in univariate analysis) between CD4+ T cell counts and total infection score (i.e., frequency and severity) but not with CD8+ T cell numbers, B cell numbers, serum immunoglobulin levels, or delayed hypersensitivity responses (Fig. 4). The significant association between disease and decreased CD4+ T cell counts was primarily dependent upon activated cells, rather than memory T cell subpopulations. In comparing the efficacy of allogeneic marrow transplantation to blood stem cell transplantation, Storek et al. (2000) demonstrated that a 1.7\u2010fold lower rate of infections in blood stem cell transplants corresponded to about a 4\u2010fold higher CD45RAhigh (memory) CD4+ T cells and about 2\u2010fold higher count for CD45RAlow (naive) CD4+ T cells. In studies conducted by Small et al. (1999), which monitored immune cell recovery following bone marrow cell transplantation, the incidence of infections also correlated with CD4+ cell counts. Only opportunistic infections were monitored, however, and they were almost exclusively present in patients considered severely immunosuppressed, with CD4+ T cell counts of <200 cells/mm3. The relationship between CD4+ cell numbers and respiratory virus infections was examined over a 3\u2010 to 6\u2010month period following transplantation in a small group of T\u2010cell depleted (using anti\u2010CD52 antibody treatment), stem cell recipients (Chakrabarti et al., 2001). The relationship between CD4+ T cell numbers and the incidence of respiratory virus infection was relatively linear. The size of the population was small, however, and CD4+ T cells in the experimental group did not progress above 180 cells/mm3, compared to 700 to 1100 cells/mm3 found in the control group.",

While immunosuppressive therapies have greatly improved over the past 40 years, transplant patients are still predisposed to high rates of malignancies and infections. Infection rates range between 65% and 70% during the first 6 months post\u2010transplantation, with CMV representing 18% to 67% of the reported infections (Sia and Paya, 1998). With the advent of long\u2010term monitoring, an increased incidence in cancer has also been noted in this population. For example, the risk of developing skin tumors following renal transplantation is 10% after 10 years and 40% after 20 years, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is 250\u2010fold higher and for basal cell carcinoma 10\u2010fold higher than the general population (Hartevelt et al., 1990). The initial immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplant consists generally of a combination cyclosporin (CsA), azathioprine, and steroid cocktail. Therapies are subsequently reduced, but adjusted based upon the time following transplant, evidence of acute rejection, evidence of toxicity (usually serum creatinine levels), and white blood cell count, the latter of which is maintained above 4000 cells/mm3. Jamil et al. (1999), examining 478 renal transplant patients, showed that the risk of lymphomas and infections during the first 6 months post\u2010transplantation increased proportionally with the level of immunosuppressive therapy ranging from 1.5\u2010 to 3\u2010fold. Urinary tract infections, which are associated with the transplant, were the most common type of infection in all groups, while severe bacterial infections (pneumonia and septicemia) and systemic/invasive fungal infections were almost exclusively associated with those on the most intensive immunosuppressive therapy. A high incidence of CMV antibodies occurred in all three groups with 9%, 29%, and 53% seroconverting, based upon the level of immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast to infectious diseases, there were fewer cases of squamous and basal cell carcinomas in the most aggressively treated group compared to the other groups, probably due to the anti\u2010prolife\u2010rative effects of some of the therapeutics. Wieneke et al. (1996), when also examining renal transplant patients, demonstrated that reduced IgG1 subclass levels and CD4 T cell counts were the best predictors for infections (relative risk increased from 9% in patients with normal values to 38% with lower values). Clark et al. (1993), following a small cohort of 27 patients, noted that by maintaining the level of CD3+ lymphocytes to at least 500 cells/mm3 a reduction in the number of serious viral infections occurred (p < 0.04).",

Phenotypic analyses of cord, neonatal, and adult peripheral blood has also shown differences in T cell subpopulations (Table 1), as well as differences in the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. At birth, the response is skewed in favor of Th2 cell responses (Upham et al., 2002), presumably decreasing the efficiency of host\u2010protective responses, particularly to intracellular bacteria, while increasing the risk of developing allergic asthma. Similar age\u2010related defects in immune function may also be a predisposing factor in repeated inner ear infections in young children. Faden (2001) noted that 5% to 10% of children experience four or more inner ear infections within the first year of life, particularly with H. influenzae.

In adults over 75 years of age, pneumonia and influenza together are the fourth leading cause of death (Yoshikawa, 1983). Although immunization is effective on a population basis, the CDC estimates that 90% of the excess deaths each year from influenza occur in individuals over 65 years old, due in part to poor vaccination responses (Fukuda et al., 1999). While the neonatal immune system is characterized by immature cells, the immune system in the elderly is characterized by normal numbers of mature cells but a decline in their ability to respond to imunogen (Shou et al., 1976; Wayne et al., 1990). Increased rates and severity of infection that occur in the elderly is the product of these effects as well as other physiological changes associated with the aging process. Physical effects include inefficient bladder function, decreased clearance of lung secretions, and reduced gastric acidity (Gavazzi and Krause, 2002), culminating in reduced barrier or clearance functions that normally reduce bacterial load in these organs. Various degrees of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are also more common in the elderly and can contribute to decreased resistance (Lesourd, 1997). Although the relative distribution of immune cells does not change dramatically in the elderly, changes in the relative abundance of certain cell subpopulations do occur. Loss of na\u00efve cells, which is secondary to thymic involution, appears in the third decade of life. Na\u00efve T cells predominate in the circulation of young adults, while the relative distribution in the elderly shifts towards an increased proportion of memory cells. For example, Lesourd (1999) reported a 55% decrease in CD45RA+ T cell counts and a 43% increase in CD45RO+ cells in a population with an average age of 78 years, compared to 30 year olds (Table 2). Despite increased populations of specifically educated memory cells, many of these cells respond poorly, presumably because they have reached their replicative limit (Effros and Pawelec, 1997). Patterns of cytokine production also change with aging. Although contradictory results have been obtained in human studies, Cakman et al. (1996) reported that IFN\u2010\u03b3 production is reduced by 70% while IL\u20104 production is increased by 4\u2010fold in the elderly compared to 20 to 35 year olds.

While it is rare for a single component of the immune system to be solely responsible for resistance to a specific infectious agent or tumor type, certain immune measures show significant correlations with the outcomes of individual host resistance assays. For example, reduction in NK cell activity has been correlated with increased susceptibility to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, B16F10 melanoma cells, and murine CMV (Luster et al., 1988; 1993; Selgrade et al., 1992). Suppression of cell\u2010mediated immunity, complement deficiency, and depressed macrophage and neutrophil function has been associated with decreased resistance to Listeria monocytogenes (Petit, 1980; Luster et al., 1988; Bradley, 1995b). Clearance of parasitic infections, such as Plasmodium yoelii and Trichinella spiralis, have both a cellular and humoral component and decreased resistance has been shown following depression of both arms of the immune system (Luebke, 1995; van Loveren et al., 1995). While the predictive values of individual immune tests for host resistance have been shown to range from relatively good (plaque forming cell assay, 73%; NK cell activity, 73%; delayed type hypersensitivity response, 82%) to poor (lymphoproliferative response to LPS <50%), combinations of several immune tests allow for very high concordance (Luster et al., 1993), indicating that only two or three specific tests are required to screen adequately for immunotoxicity.",

This can be achieved via targeted gene disruption resulting in animals deficient in specific cell populations or soluble mediators which contribute to host defense (e.g., CD4 T cell knockouts), treatment of normal animals with selective toxic agents (e.g., the use of gadolinium chloride to block macrophage function), or administration of neutralizing antibodies against critical cell\u2010specific surface receptors. A study by Wilson et al. (2001) was specifically designed to determine the magnitude of NK cell suppression that would translate into altered resistance in three disease models. The studies were conducted by NK cell depletion with an antibody to the cell surface molecule, Asialo GM1, using a treatment regimen that did not alter other standard immune function tests used in the assessment of immunotoxicity in rodents. These authors demonstrated that at low levels of tumor challenge, an approximate reduction of 50% or more in NK cell activity, now thought to be involved primarily in metastatic processes, was required before significant effects on resistance to NK\u2010sensitive tumors could be observed. These studies also demonstrated that the level of suppression needed to alter host resistance was related to the challenge level of the tumor. Conversely, studies that have used monoclonal antibodies to effectively deplete CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes have found little evidence of altered resistance to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, a model which was thought to be dependent on cell\u2010mediated immunity (Weaver et al., 2002).",

In studies designed to specifically address these limitations, Keil et al. (2001) demonstrated that monitoring several immunological parameters concurrently provides information that might not be evident from studies using single tests. Using the prototypical immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone, these authors demonstrated that contrary to what would be expected based on the compound's suppressive effects on cytokine production, T cell function, and NK cell activity, relatively high levels of dexamethasone were needed to decrease resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. At doses that suppressed many immune parameters, an increase in neutrophil numbers, and nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages was observed. It was suggested that at lower doses of dexamethasone, the significant increase in the concentration of neutrophils in the blood, in conjunction with increased production of nitric oxide, compensated for the decrements in other immune parameters so that overall resistance to the pathogen was not compromised (Keil et al., 2001). Heryzk et al. (1997) have developed a testing paradigm that evaluates immune function within the context of resistance to a specific infection. Following infection with Candida albicans, a four\u2010parameter model is used that includes survival, spleen colony forming units (CFU), muscle CFU, and antibody titers, and which the authors suggest allows an inclusive evaluation of both nonspecific, cell\u2010, and humoral\u2010mediated immune responses. This approach has proved successful in identifying both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory compounds and has the advantage of being able to evaluate multiple immune endpoints in an intact animal and directly relate them to a clinical endpoint. The utility of the method as a screening tool has yet to be evaluated using large numbers of test articles or environmental chemicals, and the procedure is not widely used outside of the pharmaceutical industry.",

It was observed that even immunologically normal animals, provided a sufficient number of tumor cells, develop a high frequency of tumors and the number of tumor cells required to produce tumors decreased proportionally to the degree of immunosuppression. This was interpreted to indicate that immune function\u2013disease response relationships tended to be linear in nature, rather than threshold. Although it is not possible to confirm these relationships in humans, it was suggested that similar response relationships would also be applicable to humans, albeit with different slopes, provided other modifiers were not present. Similar relationships were suggested in studies of mice treated with cyclosporin and challenged with group B streptococcus, although studies using L. monocytogenes challenge indicated that the dose\u2010response curve would be affected by the composite effects on all immune parameters (Keil et al., 2001).",

This decision process should take into account the social and economic impact of the potential health effects that would ensue. In order to begin establishing a framework for incorporating immunotoxicology data in the risk assessment/management process, it is necessary to identify the social and economic impact of infectious diseases in the general population. While precise information is not readily available, several sources indicate these to be significant and that even small changes in infectious disease frequency has a major impact. The impacts associated with mortality, and to a lesser extent morbidity, from common pathogens such as influenza and pneumonia, have been determined and can serve as a basis in the risk management process. Deaths have the most costly impact on society. In 2000, the age\u2010adjusted death rate for influenza and pneumonia was 23.0 and 0.6 per 100,000, respectively, based on the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision coding (ICD\u201010, 1992). Together these infections were ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. for all ages (Anderson, 2002). In 2000, the mortality rates for all infants from influenza and pneumonia were 7.5 deaths per 100,000 live births, a decline from 8.4 in 1999 (Hoyert et al., 2001; Minino et al., 2002). In both years, this number was dominated by pneumonia. Other conditions secondarily related to these illnesses, such as disorders related to low birth weights, respiratory distress, or bacterial sepsis, accounted for higher infant deaths (Minino et al., 2002), including neonates (<28 days of age); however, influenza and pneumonia still ranked seventh for post neonates (Anderson, 2002). For the \u226565 years age group, chronic lower respiratory disease and influenza\u2010pneumonia were the fourth and fifth ranked leading causes of death in 2000, respectively (Anderson, 2002); however, pneumonitis due to aspirating solids and liquids into the lung is becoming a more common cause of death among the elderly and is now ranked as the fifteenth leading cause of death (Minino et al., 2002).",
