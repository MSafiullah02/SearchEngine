However, short and/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput experimental approaches -such as ribosome profiling -cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. ORF3a* is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and encodes a 40-41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.",

            "text": "The aetiological agent of COVID-19 is the virus SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a positivesense RNA genome, around 30,000 nt in size. The 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome contain two long open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). ORFs 1a and 1b encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, where translation of pp1ab depends on a proportion of ribosomes making a programmed \u22121 nt ribosomal frameshift near the end of ORF1a to enter ORF1b. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically processed to produce the viral replication proteins (reviewed in Snijder et al., 2016) . The 3\u2032 third of the genome contains a number of ORFs that encode the viral structural and accessory proteins. These ORFs are translated from a nested series of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) that are produced during the infection cycle (reviewed in Sola et al., 2015) . In SARS-CoV-2, these ORFs comprise S, 3a, E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, N, 9b and possibly 10 (Fig. 1a) . The S, E, M and N ORFs encode respectively the virus spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins -key components of the virus particle that are conserved among coronaviruses. ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b encode accessory proteins, also present in SARS-CoV-1, but less widely conserved across coronaviruses as a whole (reviewed in Liu et al., 2014) . These 3\u2032 ORFs each have a corresponding dedicated sgmRNA except for ORFs 7b, 9b and 10. ORFs 7b and 9b appear to be translated from the ORF7a and N sgmRNAs, respectively, via a leaky scanning mechanism (Schaecher et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2009) whereas the translation mechanism for ORF10 is unknown.",

Even within the sarbecovirus genus, there are differences. For example, SARS-CoV-1 has an ORF3b that overlaps the 3\u2032 region of ORF3a but is absent in SARS-CoV-2. Also, in many human-adapted SARS-CoV-1 isolates, ORF8 is split by a frame-disrupting deletion (He et al., 2004) . ORF10 is apparently translated in SARS-CoV-2 (Finkel et al., 2020) but is truncated in SARS-CoV-1. Identification of the full complement of genes in SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial step towards gaining a fuller understanding of its molecular biology, and may also help guide vaccine or other antiviral strategies. This information also facilitates rational manipulation of the viral genome (e.g. for developing replicon systems or for mutagenesis studies). However, short and/or overlapping genes can be particularly difficult to identify using traditional computational approaches. On the other hand, high throughput experimental techniques such as ribosome profiling and high resolution mass spectrometry -while powerful -do not necessarily distinguish between functional proteins, regulatory translation (where it is the act of translation rather than the encoded product that is biologically relevant), and translational noise.",

Analysis of synonymous substitution rates provides a particularly sensitive technique for identifying overlapping functional elements embedded within protein-coding genes, because such elements constrain synonymous changes which otherwise are selectively more-or-less neutral (Firth, 2014) . When combined with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and the conserved presence of a plausible translation mechanism, overlapping genes may be distinguishable from overlapping non-coding elements such as functionally important RNA structures (Jagger et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2012; Loughran et al., 2012; Lulla & Firth, 2020) .",

The analysis revealed conserved features towards the 5\u2032 end of ORF1a, in the middle of ORF1a, near the end of ORF1a and start of ORF1b, and in many parts of the 3\u2032 region of the viral genome. Most of these conserved elements do not correspond to conserved open reading frames and likely represent functional RNA sequence elements -a case in point being the frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot (Baranov et al., 2005) at the junction of ORFs 1a and 1b. However a peak in conservation within ORF3a stood out since, although short, it coincides with an overlapping alternative-frame AUG-initiated ORF -hereafter ORF3a*positioned close to the 5\u2032 end of ORF3a where it might be accessible via ribosomal leaky scanning (reviewed in Firth & Brierley, 2012) .",

The 3a* AUG codon is present in all except one of the 54 sequences, where it is replaced with GUG (MG772933, a bat CoV). In all 54 sequences, there is an A at the \u22123 position giving a strong initiation context (Kozak, 1986) . The GUG in MG772933 may also serve as an initiation site as GUG codons can be utilized for initiation -at a reduced efficiency compared to AUG -when in a strong initiation context (reviewed in Firth & Brierley, 2012) . In 52 sequences there are two upstream AUGs -the ORF3a AUG (weak context; C or U at \u22123) and another AUG also in the ORF3a reading frame (weak context; U at \u22123); in the remaining two sequences the second of these AUGs is absent. The two weak-context AUGs might enable a proportion of pre-initiation scanning 43S complexes loaded on the ORF3a sgmRNA to leaky scan to the 3a* initiation codon. The 3a* ORF has length 40 codons in all 54 sequences except one, namely SARS-CoV-2, where it is 41 codons in length (Fig. 2) . The SARS-CoV-2 putative 3a* protein has a molecular mass of 4.9 kDa and a pI of 10.9. The protein is also predicted to contain a transmembrane domain (Fig. 2) . Curiously, the transmembrane amino acids are relative highly conserved, suggesting they may form interactions within the lipid bilayer for example membranedisrupting or membrane-associated signalling activities.",

A recent ribosome profiling study of cells infected with SARS-COV-2 revealed 23 novel translated ORFs (Finkel et al., 2020) . Ten are very short (\u2264 15 codons). Seven of the remainder comprise 5\u2032 extensions or 5\u2032 truncations of previously known ORFs (M, 6, 7a, 7b, 9b and 10). Two are uORFs positioned on the gRNA upstream of ORF1a that may play a role in regulating ORF1a/1b expression as previously proposed for uORFs in other coronaviruses (Wu et al., 2014; Irigoyen et al., 2016) . After excluding these ORFs, only four novel translated ORFs remain: ORF3a* (25457..25582; 41 codons), another ORF overlapping ORF3a (25596..25697; 33 codons), an ORF overlapping the S ORF (21744..21863; 39 codons) and a truncated version of the same (21768..21863; 31 codons) (where numbers indicate ORF coordinates in NC_045512.2). We investigated the four overlapping ORFs (yellow rectangles, Fig. 3 ) and found only ORF3a* to coincide with a synonymous site conservation signal. Moreover, the other novel ORFs were not conserved: in many sarbecovirus sequences they lacked the AUG codon and were interrupted by stop codons (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "Although synonymous site conservation can result from overlapping non-coding or coding elements, the conserved presence and conserved positions of the ORF3a* start and stop codons suggests the latter interpretation. Moreover, the ribosome profiling study of Finkel et al. (2020) confirms that the ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. The combination of comparative genomics showing purifying selection (which to a large extent is synonymous with functional importance) and ribosome profiling showing expession strongly suggests that 3a* is a functional protein, conserved throughout sarbecoviruses. While the known SARS-CoV-2 genes have already been studied in SARS-CoV-1 (reviewed in Liu et al., 2014) , 3a* has never before been studied. Clearly additional work with SARS-CoV reverse genetics systems will be required to elucidate the 3a* protein function, but it may eventually provide a new target for vaccine or antiviral strategies. The synplot2 analysis (Fig. 1b) can also reveal other functional elements embedded within the viral protein-coding genes, which may also be worthy of experimental investigation.",

These cut-off thresholds corresponded precisely to genus Sarbecovirus. Sequences that did not cover the entire protein-coding region of the genome, and all sequences with >99% amino acid identity in pp1ab to SARS-CoV-1 except a single reference sequence NC_004718. Synonymous site conservation was analyzed with synplot2 (Firth, 2014) . For the full-genome analyses, codon-respecting alignments were produced using a procedure described previously (Firth, 2014) . In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (GenBank accession number NC_045512.2) using code2aln version 1.2 (Stocsits et al., 2005) . Genomes were then mapped to NC_045512.2 coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the known virus coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated in-frame, and the alignment analyzed with synplot2 using a 25-codon sliding window. Conservation statistics were then mapped back to NC_045512.2 coordinates for plotting (Fig. 1) .",

Known ORFs are overlaid in red, blue or green depending on their relative reading frames (+0, +1, +2, respectively). Below are shown the positions of AUG (green) and stop (black) codons in each of the three reading frames, as indicated, in the reference sequence NC_045512.2. The putative ORF3a* is indicated in pink. (b) Synonymous site conservation analysis of 54 aligned sarbecovirus sequences. The red line shows the probability that the observed conservation could occur under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, whereas the brown line depicts the ratio of the observed number of substitutions to the number expected under the null model. The horizontal dashed grey line indicates a p = 0.05 threshold after an approximate correction for multiple testing, namely scaling by (25-codon window size)/(length of plot in codons). Prior to analysis, the alignment was mapped to NC_045512.2 coordinates by removing alignment positions in which NC_045512.2 contained a gap character.",
