This disease was produced by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, whose origin remains unknown [1] , [2] . However, the scientists observed this disease is very contagious. It spread rapidly throughout the world, becoming a pandemic with an increased death rate as it left China. Thus, knowing the behavior of the disease is of utmost importance to take the appropriate sanitary measures. Researchers observed the pandemic rules in different countries; they noticed that when the control measures were relaxed, and a large number of people severely infected, the health services could be saturated. Therefore, it is necessary to establish efficient methods for estimating the number of infected people accurately; thus, this helps the health authorities to take the correct measures at the appropriate time using SIR or other pandemic models.

Also, among the best methods for M4-competition are hybrid methods such as SVR with ES and ARIMA [8] . Inspired by these ideas, we decided to design a forecasting hybrid method for the Covid-19 time series. This method is named SVR-ESAR (SVR with ES and ARIMA), and it is presented in section three, after a brief background in section two. Then we used infected cases that we have taken from the Github repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/blob/master/archived_data/archived_time _series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed_archived_0325.csv) and we prepared foiur scenarios for and experimentation is described in section four.

We found SVR-ESAR with an ARIMA adjustment obtained the best or equivalent results for all these scenarios. We applied this method for data of Mexico with modest quality results. However, the results of SVR-ESAR were compared with those published in the literature for the US and China, and we found the proposed method achieved the best predictions.",
