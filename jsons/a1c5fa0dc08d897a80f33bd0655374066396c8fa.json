However, while mutations affecting RNA-binding have been described, the precise RNA binding site has not been identified nor which domains are involved. Here, we present biophysical evidence for the presence of RNA binding sites on both TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and coiled-coil domains, and map the binding site on the PRY/SPRY with residue resolution. Cooperative RNA-binding of both domains enhances their otherwise transient interaction in solution and increases the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25. Mutational analysis shows that RNA binding affects ubiquitination of RIG-I in mammalian cells. In addition, we present a simple model system for RNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of TRIM25 in vitro, resembling previously observed cellular RNA granules, that facilitates the recruitment of RIG-I.",

Many of these viruses have developed host-pathogen interactions to evade host immunity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The recent outbreaks of emerging human pathogens such as Ebola in Western Africa in 2013-2016 or the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the steady rise in Dengue virus infections over the last 50 years as a consequence of human-made climate change, as well as the seasonal death toll caused by Influenza virus, which could be significantly increased in the event of a pandemic, highlight the importance of understanding these host-pathogen interactions as a potential target for fighting these diseases.",

TRIM25 is part of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of ubiquitin ligases characterized by an N-terminal RING domain, followed by one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil (CC) dimerization domain and a C-terminal region, which, depending on the subfamily, can feature various domains ( Figure 1A ). TRIM25 is a member of the PRY/SPRY domain subfamily and the first member of this subgroup where RNA binding has been observed (6, (12) (13) (14) . TRIM25 has reported functions in innate immunity, morphogenesis and cell proliferation (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , but mechanistic understanding of its mode of action is scarce.",

The importance of this pathway in innate immunity is highlighted by the variety of mechanisms that viruses have evolved to inhibit TRIM25 activity and evade the host defense (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . TRIM25 has been shown to also ubiquitinate other targets, often RNA-binding proteins. In embryonic stem cells, TRIM25 is required for the binding of Lin28a to the precursor of let-7 (pre-let-7), which in turn recruits Tut4 to the RNA (23) . Tut4, after activation through ubiquitination by TRIM25, poly-uridylates pre-let-7 and thereby marks it for degradation. Also, TRIM25 ubiquitinates the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), a protein interacting with viral mRNA and facilitating exosome-mediated degradation (24) . Various RNAs seem to act as co-factors for TRIM25's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of RIG-I and ZAP (25) (26) (27) . While most studies point towards an activating role of RNA on TRIM25 in vitro, there is some evidence that the Dengue virus uses its subgenomic RNA to inhibit TRIM25 and its role in interferon expression (3) .",

            "text": "Despite clear evidence for the importance of RNA-binding for TRIM25 activity, the molecular mechanism of this activation remains unexplained and structural data on the TRIM25-RNA interaction is lacking. The identity of the RNA-binding domain also remains controversial, with the CC domain originally being identified (12) , while more recent data point towards the PRY/SPRY domain (25) . In addition, a lysine-rich part of the linker connecting CC and PRY/SPRY domain was proposed to be involved in this interaction (26) . Here, we resolve this controversy by showing that the CC and PRY/SPRY domains act together cooperatively to bind RNA. We have previously shown that the PRY/SPRY and CC interact weakly in solution (28) and that this interaction is necessary for RIG-I ubiquitination. Binding to RNA enhances the CC-PRY/SPRY interaction, mechanistically explaining the observed activation of TRIM25 E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. Functional assays in mammalian cells confirm the importance of RNA binding interfaces on both domains, as RNA binding mutants lessen RIG-I ubiquitination. RNA-binding also induces the formation of macromolecular condensates (liquidliquid phase separation) in vitro and recruits RIG-I CARDs into these condensates. TRIM25 also forms condensates in cells. This suggests a completely new molecular mechanism of TRIM25/RIG-I interaction in which a common RNA acting as a scaffold rather than direct protein/protein-interactions is critical to bring the two proteins together.",

Upon titration with the single stranded part of pre-let-7 (pre-let-7 loop), we observed CSPs only for residues located at binding-site-1, whereas binding-site-2 was unaffected ( Figure 1E ). To ensure that the short stem is double-stranded, we fused the strands together by a three bases long linker (pre-let-7 stem). Titration with the resulting RNA construct strongly affected both binding sites, 1 and 2 ( Figure 1F ). Together this suggests that the second binding site is specific for double-stranded RNA, while the first binding site seemingly binds to single-and double-stranded RNA. The presence of two binding sites with distinct binding preferences in close proximity suggests a possible binding selectivity for structural elements rather than sequence specificity. Indeed, comparing other reported RNA targets of TRIM25, we found that all feature stem loops of similar size and sequence as pre-let-7. We used ITC to measure the affinity of several of these stem loops to TRIM25 CC-PRY/SPRY (Table 1) . We observed very tight binding of this construct to pre-let-7 (K D = 72 \u00b1 33nM, Figure 2A ) and similar stem loops Figure S3A ). Due to these complications we could only quantify and compare the highest affinity binding event. The significance of the lower affinity binding events is not clear, but since they generally feature low N-values, they may represent RNA-induced oligomerisation. This is supported by the observation of protein aggregation upon RNA addition for most of these RNAs.",

This is also evident from the pairwise distance distribution, P(r), obtained from the SAXS data, where the free protein shows a broad distribution with two distinct maxima, indicating that the two domains tumble independently. In contrast, the complex shows a single maximum with a much narrower distribution, indicating that it tumbles as a single, compact entity ( Figure 2C ).

We found that a double mutant on the basic surface close to the PRY/SPRY binding site (K283A/K285A) in the context of the CC-PRY/SPRY reduced RNA-binding about 8-fold (K D = 606 \u00b1 124 nM, Figure 2D ). This surface patch also harbours tyrosine 278, whose phosphorylation was previously shown to affect TRIM25's E3 ligase activity (45) . Since the close proximity to the RNA binding residues might suggest that phosphorylation of Y278 could also affect RNA binding, we tested RNA binding of the Y278A mutant in ITC, but found no effect on binding affinity to pre-let-7. It is however likely that additional residues on the CC are involved in RNA Figure 3B ). It is noteworthy that the effect of both wildtype and mutants is strongest for di-and tri-ubiquitination, while mono-ubiquitination is almost unaffected. It is possible that mono-ubiquitination of CARDs is caused by an E3 ligase other than TRIM25 or RNA binding might be required for chain elongation, but not initiation. The latter could be an E2 specific effect, supported by the observation reported earlier that Ubc13/Uev1A, the E2 complex specific for the production of K63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro only produces unanchored ubiquitin chains, suggesting that a second E2 is necessary for chain initiation (46, 47) .",

To our knowledge this is the first evidence for an interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I in vitro, although it is at this stage not clear if this is due to direct protein/protein interactions or so far unobserved RNA-binding of RIG-I CARDs. However, our NMR experiments rule out a direct PRY/SPRY:RIG-I CARDs interaction unless RNA binding of the PRY/SPRY allosterically increases affinity to CARDs. The observation that the T55I mutation on the CARDs, that was reported to reduce TRIM25/RIG-I interaction in cells, has no such effect in our in vitro assays further shows that a binary PRY/SPRY:CARDs interaction is insufficient to explain the association (2) . Irrespective of the nature of this interaction, this experiment demonstrates that RNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation could account for the efficient recruitment of RIG-I to TRIM25 despite the absence of detectable interactions between the isolated proteins. The described system might therefore act as a model system to further study the determinants of liquid-liquid phase separation and RIG-I activation by TRIM25.",

While we confirm and refine a previously identified binding region on the PRY/SPRY, we found additional binding sites on the PRY/SPRY and CC. The novel second binding site on the PRY/SPRY seems to be specific for double-stranded RNA and overlaps with a region previously thought to be involved in RIG-I binding (42) . The close proximity of binding sites specific for single and double stranded RNA suggests a specificity for structure rather than sequence and indeed we found binding with nanomolar affinity to several stem-loops regardless of sequence. This may explain the failure of previous studies to identify a clear RNA motif for TRIM25 (23) . The highly cooperative binding mode involving multiple binding sites on different domains is critical for the E3ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25, as RNA binding stabilizes the weak interaction between the CC and PRY/SPRY domain which was previously shown to be critical for TRIM25's catalytic activity (28) .",

It is however not clear how RING dimerization, that is necessary for the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25 but not TRIM28, is achieved in this model (46, 47, 58) . Such RING dimerization could occur between two TRIM25 dimers stacking up end to end. Such an inter-dimer association could also be facilitated by RNA binding, especially through enrichment in RNA granules leading to high concentrations. Alternative models have been proposed, that place the RING domain closer to the center of the CC, allowing for RING dimerization within the TRIM25 dimer (47, 59) We note that our proposed mechanism of TRIM25 activation resembles the mechanism of RNA dependent regulation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity of roquins (60): Roquins feature two rigid multidomain motifs, that are connected by a flexible linker and both bind RNA. RNA binding therefore removes flexibility from the system and forces the protein into an active conformation. It should be noted, that in this case the effect is E2 dependent, so that RNA binding not only changes the extent of ubiquitination, but also specificity for certain chain compositions. Similar effects might also occur for TRIM25, as the close proximity of the RNA binding site and the RING domain in the above model combined with the necessity to accommodate both RNA and the E2~ubiquitin conjugate likely cause steric restrictions for the full complex. Such an interference of the RING domain with RNA binding could explain the earlier observation that RNA binding of full-length TRIM25 is weaker than that of CC-SPRY alone (26) .",

This suggests possible mechanisms in which either more than one TRIM25 dimer can bind to one RNA molecule leading to a linear polymer or the PRY/SPRY domains of one TRIM25 molecule binds to the CC of a different molecule, an interaction that is strongly enhanced by RNA binding and could ultimately lead to formation of a cross-linked gel ( Figure 6B ). The necessity for binding of more than one TRIM25 dimer might explain why DENV-SL, but not the smaller pre-let-7 or lnczc3h7a stem loops induce phase separation. In this case, it should be expected that in the cellular context with RNA targets much longer than the minimal constructs used in this study, formation of TRIM25-RNA macromolecular condensates should be a common occurrence. Sanchez et al. noted that phase-separated condensates might form the necessary environment allowing for efficient interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I and thereby resolve the apparent paradox that the TRIM25/RIG-I interaction is well established in vivo, but could not be reconstituted in vitro (26) .",

            "text": "Indeed, we found no evidence for a direct interaction between the TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and RIG-I CARDs in our NMR experiments, although these two domains alone are sufficient for coimmunoprecipitation from cells (15) . We noted however, that several of the mutants described to reduce the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I (F592, I594, L604 in murine TRIM25, corresponding to F597, I589 and L599 in human TRIM25) are located on or close to the second RNA binding site on the PRY/SPRY domain (42) . This suggests that RNA binding of both proteins to double-stranded segments in the same RNA could play a crucial role in RIG-I activation (Figure 7 ). This finding is supported by the recent identification of long non-coding RNAs that bind to both TRIM25 and RIG-I and facilitate their interaction (27, 44) . One of these RNAs is lnczc3h7a, that was described to interact with the RIG-I helicase domain independently of viral RNA and does not release autoinhibition of RIG-I (27) . However, this cannot explain how isolated RIG-I CARDs in vitro enrich in TRIM25/DENV-SL droplets, which requires either so far unreported RNA binding of the CARDs, an unreported interaction between CARDs and TRIM25 CC rather than PRY/SPRY or an allosteric change in TRIM25 upon RNA binding leading to increased affinity to CARDs.",

Like RIG-I, many other substrates of TRIM25, e.g. ZAP, TUT4, MDM2 and p53 (23, 24, 49, 62, 63) , are putative RNA binding proteins and a mechanism that involves recruitment of these substrates through binding to the same RNA molecule or enrichment in RNA granules and activation of the TRIM25 E3 ligase activity through RNA-binding might be more universal.",

Among these are several TRIM proteins (TRIM4, 15, 40) and Riplet, a close relative of TRIM25, that lost the B-Box domains and parts of the CC (70) (71) (72) . Mechanistically, a sequential ubiquitination of RIG-I by first Riplet in the CTD and then TRIM25 at the CARDs has been proposed (68) . It is noteworthy that although Riplet is closely related to TRIM25, it has lost the regions on the CC and in the L2 linker, which harbors RNA binding in TRIM25, and the RNA binding lysines and histidine found in the PRY/SPRY are not conserved. Interestingly, while the depends on the presence of both domains (2, 28) . This suggests that binding to the same RNA could also stabilize the TRIM25/NS1 interaction, thus deactivating TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. A similar mechanism was recently proposed for the interaction of NS1 with DHX30 (74) . The inhibition of TRIM25 by other viral proteins such as paramyxovirus protein V and coronavirus protein N even depends only on their C-terminal domains that are also RBDs (4, 7, 75, 76) . RNA binding might therefore be widely exploited by viruses to inhibit TRIM25 and its crucial function in innate immunity. quantified and show a twenty-fold enrichment of RFP-CARDs in the droplets, while RFP enrichment is less than 2-fold. The T55I mutant reported to reduce the interaction of TRIM25 and RIG-I CARDs (77) has no significant impact on enrichment in the granules. ",

Interestingly, the double mutant Y463S/Y476S, that reduces the interaction between CC and PRY/SPRY (28) reduced also RNA binding (K D = 252 \u00b1 61 nM), further supporting our hypothesis in which RNA binding stabilizes the CC-PRY/SPRY interaction.RNA binding regulates ubiquitination activityWe have previously demonstrated the importance of the transient CC-PRY/SPRY interaction for the catalytic activity of TRIM25 in RIG-I signaling(28) and as we propose a stabilization of this interaction upon RNA binding, we next investigated the effect of RNA binding mutants on the ubiquitination activity of TRIM25. To do so, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with wildtype or mutant TRIM25 and FLAG-tagged RIG-I CARDs (Figure 3A). Expression levels of TRIM25 and ubiquitination of the CARD domains were detected by Western blotting. Overexpression of wildtype TRIM25 caused robust ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs. However, both K602E and H505E/K508E on the PRY/SPRY as well as K283A/K285A on the CC reduced ubiquitination below the background level observed in the absence of exogenous TRIM25 expression, demonstrating that reduced RNA binding also reduces ubiquitination of RIG-I CARDs (",

Previous studies have established that the TRIM25 PRY/SPRY domain and the RIG-I CARDs alone are sufficient for robust interaction and ubiquitination in cells(15) (42). We therefore titrated unlabelled RIG-I CARDs into15 Nlabelled TRIM25 PRY/SPRY to monitor expected chemical shift perturbations and/or line broadening to identify interacting residues. However, while such an approach would almost certainly detect any direct interaction with affinities down to low millimolar affinities, we did not observe any signs of interaction (Figure 4A). While not completely ruling out the possibility of a TRIM25-RIG-I interaction, this strongly suggests the absence of a direct interaction between TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and RIG-I CARDs. D'Cruz et al. (42) proposed a mechanism of RIG-I binding, that would involve displacement of the N-terminal helix \u03b1 1 of the PRY/SPRY by a similar helix in the CARDs. We therefore characterized secondary structure and flexibility of \u03b1 1 using 15 N relaxation measurements and heteronuclear NOEs (HetNOE). We found that \u03b1 1 forms a stable helix in solution and tumbles together with the core domain, as residues in this region have the same apparent rotational correlation time as the entire domain. This indicates that a mechanism that involves unfolding or flipping out of \u03b1 1 is very unlikely (Figure 4B-D) and agrees with earlier observations, that although the functional interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I is very well established in cells, there is no evidence",

We found that TRIM25 binds a stem-loop of the Dengue virus subgenomic RNA with almost ten-fold higher affinity than the TRIM25-binding stem-loop of lnczc3h7a, a long non-coding RNA that binds both TRIM25 and RIG-I and thereby facilitates interferon expression(27). This suggests that the subgenomic RNA canoutcompete lnczc3h7a for TRIM25 binding. It is however not clear what the effect of this competition is, since in our in vitro experiments the DENV-SL RNA still promoted association of TRIM25 and RIG-I. This agrees with the original reports which found that the viral subgenomic RNA did not reduce TRIM25/RIG-I co-purification (3). A possible explanation might be that rather than inhibiting the ubiquitination of RIG-I, it could prevent the re-localization of TRIM25/RIG-I complexes to the mitochondrial membrane and thereby downstream activation of MAVS (73) by targeting them to RNA granules as we observed in vitro. RNA binding might also play a key role in other viral inhibition mechanisms for TRIM25. Most notably, the Influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) also features an RNA-binding domain in addition to the TRIM25 binding effector domain (ED)(2,28). Interestingly, in vitro the ED alone is sufficient to explain binding to TRIM25, but in cells co-purification with TRIM25",

This is supported by heteronuclear NOEs (C), that show strong correlation of the backbone N-H vectors. This shows that \u03b1 1 forms a secondary structure. Relaxation measurements (D) give information on the backbone dynamics of individual residues. The residues in the \u03b1 1 region show similar dynamics as the core domain.

The CC is not suitable for NMR studies due to its size and extended conformation, which causes slow molecular tumbling and NMR resonance line broadening beyond detection. Instead, to test the CC's putative RNA-binding capacity(12,44), we used ITC to characterize its RNA binding properties(Table 1). We found that the CC binds pre-let-7 with low micromolar affinity (8.1 \u00b1 3.1\u00b5M)(Figure 2A), slightly weaker than the PRY/SPRY domain.For both the PRY/SPRY and the CC domain, we observed low N-values, likely indicating, that each RNA molecule is big enough to bind several domains, allowing for cooperativity. It is therefore possible that cooperative RNA-binding of the CC and PRY/SPRY domain depends on the interaction between these domains in solution. As we have previously shown, the CC: PRY/SPRY interaction is much weaker than the interaction with RNA(28). We therefore used solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to test for a stabilisation of the transient interaction between CC and PRY/SPRY domain through RNA-binding.
