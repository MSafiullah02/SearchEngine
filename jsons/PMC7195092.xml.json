Serial assessments aim to estimate the trajectory of a patient's clinical course, which in turn informs ventilator triage decisions. Patients with improving clinical status should be considered for endotracheal extubation and transfer out of the intensive care unit, whereas patients with worsening clinical status and poor overall prognosis should be considered for palliative extubation and palliative care.5 Illness severity should be determined using a combination of clinical and laboratory findings. A validated method to combine these findings is the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) tool, which reflects the function of six organ systems. An elevated SOFA score is one of several tools that have been used to triage scarce resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Further stratification on the basis of specific clinical phenotypes or biomarkers would enhance the specificity of triage; however, in the setting of COVID-19, more evidence is needed before such approaches can be implemented.",

Other resources that might be limited include endotracheal tubes, vasopressors, sedatives, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intensive care space, and critical care nurses and physicians. Allocation principles are meant to mitigate the worst outcomes that might result from a scarcity of resources during a crisis. A flexible approach to triage decision making should be taken to respond to emerging knowledge of the mechanisms and course of COVID-19. Hospitals should adopt policies for making transparent allocation decisions about ventilators and other critical resources that are based on an explicit ethical framework. The emerging gold standard is for triage teams to make decisions independently from, and in communication with, frontline clinical staff.5 These teams should be multidisciplinary, be connected to a hospital ethics committee, and report to hospital leadership. It is also the role of governments to counter shortages through legislation, mobilisation of resources, and provision of supplies to communities hit hardest by the pandemic.",
