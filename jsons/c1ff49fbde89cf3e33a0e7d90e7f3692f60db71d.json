We report the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, cytokines, and human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) and its receptor expressions in a patient suffering from critical COVID-19 pneumonia to convalescence. Methods. Clinical data of the patient were collected from medical records. The expressions of HLA-G and receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells were measured with flow cytometry. Results. From critical COVID-19 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 9 10 9 L \u00c01 vs. 0.9 9 10 9 L \u00c01 , P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed. Initially, low levels of CD4 + T cells (from 120 to 528 lL \u00c01 ) and CD8 + T cells (from 68 to 362 lL \u00c01 ) gradually increased to normal levels. Meanwhile, high IL-6 (from 251.8 to 6.32 pg mL \u00c01 ), IL-10 (from 39.53 to 5.21 pg mL \u00c01 ) and IFN-c (from 13.55 to 3.16 pg mL \u00c01 ) levels decreased, and IL-4 (from 2.36 to 3.19 pg mL \u00c01 ) and TNF-a (from 2.27 to 20.2 pg mL \u00c01 ) levels increased quickly when the viral RNA returned negative. Moreover, the percentage of HLA-G + T cells, B cells and monocytes follows high-low-high pattern, while the percentage of receptors ILT2-, ILT4-and KIR2DL4-expressing cells remained relatively stable. Conclusion. Our findings provide valuable information on the dynamics of early peripheral immunological responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, cytokines and HLA-G + immune cells are associated with the natural history of the critical COVID-19 patient; however, future studies are necessary.",

            "text": "An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia COVID-19 caused by the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 (initially 2019-nCoV) is threatening public health. 1 Since the first reported case on 31 December 2019 to 27 February 2020, more than 2700 cases have resulted in death, and an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 have been consecutively reported in more than twenty countries including Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Korea and other nations. 2 In addition to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, SARS-CoV-2 has become the third coronavirus that seriously threatens public health in the past two decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 3, 4 Currently, no effective therapeutic agents are available for SARS-CoV-2, although many pioneer clinical trials are underway. It has been found that host humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses are indispensable to fight back and control infectious diseases. 5 Immune functional modulators and effectors such as cytokines and chemokines, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) expression are interfered with via viral infection and can play crucial roles in the control of virus replication and the outcome of patients. 6 In this scenario, human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) and its immune cell surface-expressed receptor signalling pathway has been well known to modulate the functions of T cells, B cells and NK cells, and is involved in viral infection. 7, 8 In this study, we recorded and analysed the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, the expression of HLA-G and its receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells, and the outcomes of a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 (critical COVID-19) during the 23-day hospitalisation. These findings were compared between the day when SARS-CoV-2 RNA confirmed positive and the day when the result returned to negative. Our preliminary data may help future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The percentage of the ILT2 + T cells, B cells and monocytes was with the median of 80.90% Previous studies have revealed that cytokines can modulate HLA-G and its receptor expressions. In this preliminary study, we analysed the relationship between the levels of cytokines and HLA-G and its receptor expressions in peripheral immune cell subsets. HLA-G expression in B cells was positively related to IFN-c levels (r = 0.776, P = 0.040) while HLA-G expression in monocytes was negatively related to IL-2 levels (r = \u00c00.867, P = 0.011). For receptor expression, we found that only ILT4 expression was strongly related to the cytokines. ILT4 expression in B cells was negatively correlated with TNF-a levels (r = 0.950, P = 0.001), while ILT4 expression in monocytes was positively correlated with the cytokines including IL-6 (r = 0.901, P = 0.006), IL-10 (r = 0.937, P= 0.002) and IFN-c (r = 0.899, P = 0.006) (Figure 4 ).",

            "text": "Lymphopenia is commonly observed in patients with COVID-19. In a cohort of 41 patients, Huang et al. 12 reported that 63% (26/42) of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, and the rate was markedly higher in patients admitted to the ICU than in non-ICU patients (85% vs. 54%). In the first US-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the laboratory data by Holshue et al. 13 showed that from the third to tenth hospital day, the lymphocyte count was at a low level of 1070/lL and had gradually increased to 2100/lL along with the improved condition of the disease. In line with these reports, our data showed that the lymphocyte count was also observed to have increased near to the normal level at the moment of disease improvement. Notably, our data also showed that the increased lymphocyte count might be contributed by the increase in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. However, B cells and NK cells remain more stable at rather low levels. T cells are critical for the host's cellular immune response against viral infection. The subpopulation of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill virus-infected cells directly, and CD4 + helper T lymphocytes are essential for B lymphocytes to produce virus-specific antibodies. 14 Recently, a study by Xu et al. 15 revealed that significantly decreased but hyperactivated peripheral immune cells such as CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were observed in a COVID-19 patient, and unfortunately, the patient died. The authors speculated that the hyperactivated immune cells might be involved in immune injury for the disease. However, the sampling day during the disease course for flow cytometry analysis was unclear, which is of importance for the peripheral immune cell response that could be associated with the disease status, as our present findings indicated. Consequently, the increase in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in this case, as previously reported in other infectious diseases, may play a similar antiviral role with respect to the improvement in the disease. 16 Moreover, we found that the high levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-c decreased rapidly, and the levels of IL-4 and TNF-a increase quickly when the viral RNA returned negative. In line with our observations, a previous study revealed that IL-6 and IFN-c levels were dramatically elevated during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection, whereas the IL-6 levels were observed to be related to disease severity. 17 However, in contrast to our study, TNF-a and IL-10 were not detected in patients with MERS-CoV infection, indicating that different features inducing cytokine production might exist between the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infections.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are yet unknown; however, they are thought to be similar to other viruses that have evolved various strategies, such as disturbing HLA expression and viral antigen presentation, which is commonly applied by viruses to escape the host immune system recognition and destruction. 18 HLA-G has been intensively investigated in viral infectious diseases. 19 Most previous studies have demonstrated that HLA-G expression could be upregulated in virus-infected cells such as HIV, HCMV and HCV, and have speculated that the upregulation of HLA-G expression is a potential strategy for virus immune evasion. 20, 21, 22 The underlying mechanism is that HLA-G can bind immune inhibitory receptors such as ILT2 and ILT4, and consequently inhibit the functions of immune cells and favor virus immune escape. 23 Using the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 and global transcriptomic profiling, Josset et al. 24 demonstrated that two lethal coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV could induce predominant differences in host gene expression responses. Data showed that HLA genes, including HLA-G, were observed to be specifically downregulated after MERS-CoV infection, while these genes were upregulated after SARS-CoV infection. In this study, our data showed that HLA-G expression in peripheral immune cells such as T cells, B cells and monocytes follows a high-low-high pattern, which may reflect the three stages of infection, replication and clearance of SARS-CoV-2; however, receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 remained relatively stable. Moreover, correlations between HLA-G and its receptor expressions and cytokine production were observed in our study, such as different correlations between IFN-c and IL-2 and HLA-G expression in B cells and monocytes. The dynamics of HLA-G expression in peripheral immune subsets from SARS-CoV-2-positive to SARS-CoV-2-negative indicated that the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be involved in the regulation of HLA-G expression. Given that HLA-G is an antigen presenter similar to other HLA I antigens, the downregulated HLA-G expression by SARS-CoV-2 can impair the virus CD8 + CTLmediated recognition and support immune evasion.",

One hundred microlitres of whole blood and red cells was lysed by lysis buffer(BD FACS Lysing Solution; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and was used for flow cytometry analysis. HLA-G, ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 levels on peripheral T cells, B cells and monocytes were determined. A representative flow cytometry analysis is shown in Supplementary figure 1. For T cells, two settings of antibody combinations were performed: anti-CD3-APC (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) cells were probed with anti-HLA-G-FITC (Exbio, Prague, Czech Republic) and anti-ILT2-PE (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA); and anti-CD3-APC (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) cells were probed with anti-KIR2DL4-PE (Exbio) and anti-ILT4-PE-CY7 (Biolegend). For B cells, anti-CD19-Per-CP (BD, USA) cells were probed with anti-HLA-G-FITC (Exbio), anti-ILT2-APC (Biolegend), anti-ILT4-PE-CY7 (Biolegend) and anti-KIR2DL4-PE (Exbio). For monocytes, anti-CD14-APC-CY7 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) cells were probed with anti-HLA-G-FITC (Exbio), anti-ILT2-APC (Biolegend), anti-ILT4-PE-CY7 (Biolegend) and anti-KIR2DL4-PE (Exbio). Lymphocyte subsets and cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a and IFN-c were measured with a Cytometric Bead Array Th1/Th2 Subset Kit (Hangzhou Cell Gene Biotech Co., LTD, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD Canto II flow cytometer, and data were analysed using the BD FACSuite software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).",
