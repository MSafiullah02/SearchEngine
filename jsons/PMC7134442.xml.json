Our previous studies have shown that healthcare workers' vaccination uptake may be affected by the prevailing epidemic situation.2 In an effort to understand the impacts of a severe influenza season on vaccination uptake patterns in healthcare workers, we conducted an online survey targeting members of the 20,000-strong nursing body in Hong Kong. The results were compared with unpublished data from a similar survey administered one year earlier, following approval of the Survey and Behavioral Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

Their demographics and professional profile were similar to those (N = 826) participating in a similar survey in March 2014 (Table I\n). Overall, the vaccination uptake rates were 28% and 32% in preparation for the 2014/15 season and 2013/14 season respectively. At the time of the 2015 survey, 114 (29%) of the unvaccinated nurses indicated that they would receive vaccination soon, in wake of the emergence of the H3N2 seasonal outbreak. Assuming that these latter respondents did get vaccinated, the uptake rate for the 2014/15 season would become considerably higher at 41%.",

During the 2014/15 season, there were suggestions that a mop-up campaign with an influenza vaccine composing of A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 should be considered by the government.

Whereas the vaccination uptake of nurses was low pre-seasonally, the ultimate rate could in fact be higher, as more than one-quarter of those unvaccinated in early 2015 were planning to receive vaccination following the onset of a severe influenza season. This was surprising, as the effectiveness of the year's vaccine has been proven to be low at <20%.1 Here, undecided nurses were apparently strongly influenced by their perceptions of the prevailing situation. Despite the widely broadcasted message that the vaccine was not sufficiently effective, its uptake had increased. Previously we have demonstrated that those refusing vaccination were fearful of vaccine-associated adverse effects.3 In 2009, some 13.3% of nurses refused to receive a new monovalent vaccine against influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus because of safety concerns.4 Unexpectedly, the proposed \u2018inter-seasonal\u2019 vaccine for 2015 was better accepted by 28%, perhaps reflecting their perception of the new initiative as another dose of the regularly administered instead of a new vaccine.",

The observations then and now confirmed that the prevailing epidemic condition has an important impact on the decision of healthcare workers concerning their own vaccination, amidst a whole range of factors associated with attitudes and perceptions.6 Vaccination hesitancy reflects also the continued competition between egoism and altruism.7 Whereas influenza vaccination of healthcare workers constitutes an infection control practice, many perceive this as a self-protection measure alone.8 To enhance protection, mandatory vaccination is probably the only feasible strategy to boost vaccination coverage to the 75% level advocated internationally.8 However, the impact of near-universal staff immunization on clinical outcomes has yet to be ascertained. Whereas the vaccination coverage of healthcare workers in places such as Hong Kong has remained low, health authorities should be mindful of the possible impact of influenza epidemics, which may stimulate demand for vaccination mid-season, even when the vaccine may not provide good cover.",
