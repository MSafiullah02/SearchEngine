            "text": "Insufficient WTO regulation of cross-border e-commerce confronts China and the US with three legal challenges: ambiguous classification of digital products, inadequate consumer and privacy protection, and weak protection of cross-border flow of information. China and the US have adopted converging approaches to address these challenges: inserting e-commerce chapters into their FTAs. However, the substance of these chapters is diverging. Firstly, US FTAs categorise digital products separately from goods and services and provide national treatment and most favoured nation treatment to products and their suppliers. China's FTAs still offer no solutions to the classification of digital products and their treatment. Secondly, although China's FTAs still provide weak protection for consumers and privacy, Chinese domestic law has converged towards US FTAs to provide better protection. Thirdly, US and China FTAs are significantly divergent in their regulation of the free flow of information. In the post-TPP era, a polycentric direction will emerge in the regulation of the free flow of information between China and the US.",

This forms the comparative-law backdrop for outlining how Chinese and American FTAs can tackle these challenges. In Sect. 3, this article uses historical surveys of FTAs concluded by China and the US to find that there appears to be a convergent approach in addressing these challenges, which is to go beyond the World Trade Organization ('WTO') multilateral framework and adopt a chapter specialising in e-commerce in FTAs. Section 4 argues that, although there are substantive similarities, the contents of American and Chinese e-commerce chapters are diverging. Section 5 concludes that in the future the diverging trend between Chinese and American FTAs will continue in regulations for cross-border flow of information but may gradually diminish in other fields. However, the US withdrawing from the TPP may enable China to further influence international law-making for e-commerce. As a result, e-commerce regulations in the Asia-Pacific will develop in a polycentric pattern.",

            "text": "When the WTO was established, e-commerce was still in its infancy. The WTO divides trade into trade in goods, services, and intellectual property ('IP') and regulates them accordingly. Neither the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('GATT') nor the General Agreement on Trade in Services ('GATS') defines 'ecommerce' or 'digital products', thus their classification is unclear. 14 Classification is complex because three modes of digital products exist. The first mode is essentially traditional goods, which are tangible and physical. Examples include computers, telecommunication equipment, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and testing equipment, scientific instruments and their parts and accessories. The second mode of digital products have physical carriers but their monetary value derives mainly from encoded content, such as CDs, DVDs and software in physical support, while the value of the carrier is minimal. Nowadays 97% of the first and second mode of digital products is covered by the Information Technology Agreement ('ITA'), a multilateral agreement under the WTO framework. 15 The ITA classifies the first and second modes of digital products as goods, to which custom duties and non-tariff barriers apply. 16 The ITA obliges member states to abolish all custom duties on covered products and components, aiming to eliminate non-tariff barriers in trade. 17 Both China and the US are member states to the ITA. 18 The expansion of the ITA in 2015 is a landmark achievement of the WTO negotiations, 19 but it does not regulate the third mode of digital products. The third mode has no physical carrier and is completely transmitted online. 20 The examples include e-books, downloaded or streamed movies, and the Apple Pay service. The monetary value of the products derives solely from their contents. Compared with the first two modes, the third mode is the most significant, due to its industrial usage in cloud computing, big data analytics, the Internet of Things, 3D printing, blockchain technology, etc. Regardless of their usage, digital products in this third mode are essentially cross-border flow of information (or in other words 'data'). The ITA liberalises trade mainly by decreasing tariffs and non-tariff measures, which renders little protection to cross-border flow of information.",

            "text": "WTO case law classifies certain digital products delivered electronically as cross border supply under Article 1.2(a) of the GATS. In Mexico-Telecoms, the WTO panel defined certain public telecommunications services, including circuit switched data transmissions, fax and voice telephony, as cross border supply. 21 US-Gambling is concerned with a US measure that prohibited the cross-border supply of (Internet) gambling and betting services. 22 The Appellate Body ('AB') found that electronic gambling services (online or via telephone) fell within the scope of cross-border supply and thus the US measure violated the requirement of full market access in 15 '15 Years of the Information Technology Agreement: Trade, Innovation and Global Production Networks', p. 2, https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/ita15years_2012full_e.pdf (accessed 10 March 2017).

Firstly, they are specific to certain digital products and member states. They are not binding on member states which are not parties to these cases. Secondly, neither the Panel nor the AB provides a general definition of digital products or develops a widely applicable rule for their classification in future cases. Thirdly and most importantly, W/120 adopts a positive-list approach, meaning foreign suppliers enjoy market access and national treatment only in the sectors listed in W/120. 27 Industries that are not listed are presumably not open to foreign suppliers. 28 Therefore, it is controversial whether new industries such as cloud computing are covered by W/120 or fall outside its coverage as part of the data-processing or value-added telecommunication sectors.",

Compared to the US-Jordan FTA, the US-Singapore and US-Chile FTAs impose a greater number of stronger obligations upon the party states. For example, they require non-discriminatory treatment for digital products and ban customs duties. 58 The 2005 US-Australia FTA further extends regulations to authentication and digital certificates, 59 and also provides best-effort clauses for online consumer protection 60 and paperless trade administration. 61 The US-Australia FTA is the first to regulate consumer protection in its e-commerce chapter. 62 Its e-commerce regulations are adopted by the 2009 US-Peru FTA. 63 The 2012 US-South Korea FTA takes further steps, creating principles on access to and use of the Internet for e-commerce and cross-border information flow. 64 This is significant because it makes free flow of online information a highlight of the e-commerce chapter. China only began to use FTAs to regulate e-commerce in 2006. The inaugural China-New Zealand FTA contains an Annex on the 'Cooperation in the Field of Conformity Assessment in Relation to Electrical and Electronic Equipment', which aims to reduce technical barriers to trade in electrical and electronic equipment. From 2006 to 2014, China concluded six FTAs, none of which have annexes, clauses or chapters devoted to e-commerce. 65 These FTAs follow WTO norms and regulate e-commerce through a W/120. The breakthrough came in 2015 with the China-Australia and China-South Korea FTAs, which both contain a chapter designated to e-commerce. China will likely continue to use its FTAs to regulate crossborder e-commerce. There are three main reasons that China may adopt the 'chapter' format to regulate e-commerce, particularly when negotiating with developed countries.",

In 2016, China and Pakistan introduced a proposal to the WTO Council for Trade in Goods and suggested that discussions should focus on the promotion and facilitation of cross-border trade in goods enabled by the Internet. 67 They proposed that discussions should not lead to new market access commitments and 'easy issues' should receive priority to achieve 'pragmatic progress' at the 11th Ministerial Conference ('MC11') in December 2017. In March 2017, China and Pakistan co-sponsored another proposal on e-commerce to the WTO Committee on Trade and Development. 68 This proposal, again, emphasized ongoing discussions should primarily address the promotion and facilitation of cross-border trade in goods, payments and logistics services. However, although China and some other delegations want to realize some progress by MC11, others do not share this view and hope to continue the exploratory nature of the WTO e-commerce work programme. 69 Therefore, it is still early to predict whether MC11 can achieve 'pragmatic progress'. Moreover, the Trade in Services Agreement ('TiSA'), currently negotiated under the plurilateral system under the WTO, aims to cover trade in digital products. However, the TiSA negotiation is still at the early stage and China is not a party to the negotiation. Therefore, China needs an international legal framework beyond the WTO to avoid marginalization.

National treatment and market access under the FTAs help maintain the e-commerce companies' continuous development. Chinese e-commerce companies are burgeoning and some (e.g. Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) have become national pride. 70 For example, in 2016, retailers on the platform of Alibaba, made $17.79 billion worth of gross merchandise revenue on one day (Singles' Day, November 11). 71 This completely eclipses the $2.74 billion and $3.07 billion generated online during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales respectively in the US in the same year. 72 Modern electronically transmitted digital products have challenged the categorises in the W/120, which may become a barrier for Chinese e-commerce companies to access foreign markets. For example, the computerrelated services in the W/120 cover five categories: consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware (841), software implementation services (842, with further five sub-categories), data processing services (843, with further four sub-categories), database services (844) and other services (845 and 849). WeChat, the Chinese smartphone and computer-based instant messaging software with texting, audio, video, payment, call, map and other functions, is considered more successful than Twitter and Facebook by many international IT commentators. 73 Does WeChat fall into software implementation services or data processing services? Or should it be categorised as telecommunication or financial services? Clarifying these questions benefits Chinese e-commerce companies.",

It excludes digitally encoded contents, fixed on a carrier medium, from the scope of digital products. 77 This definition departs from previous FTAs concluded by the US, which do characterize contents fixed on a carrier medium digital products, as seen in Article 16.8.4 of the US-Australia FTA, Article 15.8 of the US-Peru FTA and Article 15.9 of the US-Korea FTA. In these FTAs, 'carrier medium' is defined as any existing or later developed physical object capable of storing a digital product, and from which a digital product can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated, directly or indirectly. 78 The physical object may be an optical medium, floppy disk, magnetic tape, etc. 79 The TPP excludes digital products fixed on carrier medium from its e-commerce chapter, which helps to classify digital products into a category independent from 74 The definition of digital product in the US FTAs does not reflect a party's view on whether trade in digital products through electronic transmission should be categorised as trade in services or trade in goods in the WTO. Footnote 4 of the US-South Korea FTA and footnote 3 of the TPP. 75 goods and services. This is because CDs, DVDs and other content-based products have physical carriers so they can be governed by regulations for trade in goods. Although a digital product may be neither a good nor a service, it may be affected by investment or service measures. For example, services delivered or performed electronically are subject to regulations of the e-commerce chapter and other FTA chapters. The US-South Korea FTA provides that when regulations overlap, a state's obligations under the e-commerce chapter are subject to regulations under the chapters on investment and cross-border trade in services or financial services. 80 Where there is conflict, the latter three chapters prevail. 81 The US-South Korea FTA has Annexes I, II and III listing non-conforming measures in the chapters on investment and cross-border trade in services or financial services, which also apply to e-commerce. 82 Therefore, obligations such as the non-discriminatory treatment of digital products, cross-border transfer of information by electronic means, and location of computing facilities are exempted when a non-conforming measure is maintained or adopted according to the three annexes. 83 Neither the China-Australia FTA nor the China-South Korea FTA defines e-commerce or digital products. The China-South Korea FTA defines 'data message' as information generated, sent, received or stored by electronic, optical or similar means. 84 However, this definition is given in the context of digital signatures. 85 The future of China's FTAs may deviate from the dichotomy of goods and services under the WTO framework to create a separate category for digital products. Classification is a precondition for proper treatment to digital products. Without resolving classification issues, China cannot determine the proper treatment for digital products, which will hinder the development of Chinese e-commerce regulation. 86",

E-commerce Regulations in Chinese and American FTAs 321 example, the China-Australia FTA equalises personal information protection and online data protection, 95 while online data protection in the TPP focuses on free flow of information. 96 Although China's FTAs do not regulate Internet fraud and commercial spams, these are rampant, urgent issues that damage Chinese consumers' confidence in e-commerce. 97 Accordingly, the Chinese government has recently taken strong actions to punish Internet fraud and deter commercial spams. 98 A typical example is the newly amended Chinese Law on Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers in 2014 ('China Consumer Protection Law'). 99 Under the Law, when consumers buy goods online, they have the right to return the goods within seven days of receipt without needing to give a reason. 100 This measure may deter fraudulent online retailers peddling low-quality products. The Law also requires online sellers provide consumers with information such as their business addresses, contact methods, the quality and quantity of goods or services, and prices or costs, the duration and manner of performance, safety precautions and risk warnings, after-sales service, and civil liability. 101 This requirement can help consumers seek legal remedies against online retailers engaging in fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities. Moreover, Chinese Administrative Measures for Online Trading and China Consumer Protection Law also ban commercial spam sent without consumers' consent or after a clear refusal, 102 echoing a TPP requirement. 103 In China, consumers have recourse against commercial spam suppliers. They can bring tort claims if the spam suppliers illegally access their phone numbers or email addresses. 104 They can allege contractual breach if a telecommunication services provider promises to diminish commercial spams in a service contract but fails to do so. Consumer associations can also bring class actions on behalf of consumers against commercial spam suppliers or telecommunication companies. 105 95 103 Art. 14.14.1 of the TPP.",

In China, laws concerning personal information protection are fragmented and most regulations are issued by ministries, rather than from the National People's Congress ('NPC') and its Standing Committee. Although China does not have a comprehensive personal information protection regime, its domestic law has clearly gone beyond the personal information protection requirement in its FTAs. For example, the general requirement is that collection and use of personal information must comply with principles of legality, properness and necessity. 107 Consumers must be informed about the purpose, method and scope of the information collected and used. 108 If providing personal information is not a legal obligation, the collection of personal information must be dependent on consumers' consent. 109 In 2009, the Standing Committee of the NPC criminalised the selling or providing of personal information about any citizen, obtained during the organ's or entity's performance of duties or provision of services, by a staff member of a state organ or an entity in a field such as finance, telecommunications, transportation, education or medical treatments. 110 In December 2016, the China Internet Security Law prohibited the collection of personal data without consent and the illegal transfer or sale of personal information to third parties by ISPs and other businesses. 111 Therefore, although China's FTAs are still weak in protecting consumers and privacy, Chinese domestic law has demonstrated a converging trend with the US FTAs to provide better protection to consumers and their personal information.",

Notably, in June 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression declared that Internet access is a human right. 119 'Cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19(3) of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights'. 120 Therefore, despite these principles still being best-effort endeavours even under the TPP, they are significant because of their potential human rights connotation.

This two-tier test has been adopted by several WTO cases, such as US-Gasoline, EC-Asbestos, and US-Shrimp. 133 Article 14.11.3 of the TPP also requires a two-tiered test. A TPP member must first prove that the non-conforming measure is adopted to protect public policy. Then it must demonstrate that its implementation will not lead to arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination and it will not function as a disguised restriction on trade or impose restrictions on transfers of information greater than are required to achieve the objective. Notably, the structure of Article 14.11.3 of the TPP is the reversed form of Article XX of the GATT 1994. The former states the exception in its chapeau and the application requirement in its sub-paragraph; in contrast, the chapeau of the latter provides the application requirement, while its sub-paragraph indicates the exceptions.

XX of the GATT 1994 and Art. XIV of the GATS. 133 WTO Appellate Body Report, US-Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline (US-Gasoline), WT/DS2/AB/R, adopted 29 April 1996, para. 22; WTO Panel Report, EC-Measures Affecting Asbestos and Asbestos-Containing Products (EC-Asbestos), WT/DS135/R, adopted 18 September 2000, para. 6.20; WTO Panel Report, US-Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products (US-Shrimp), WT/DS58/R, adopted 15 May 1998, paras. 5.27-5.28. 134 US-Gasoline, above n. 133, para. 24. unjustifiable discrimination. 135 The effects of discrimination are not determinant. The AB also stated that arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination exists when the reasons given for the discrimination were not rationally connected to the objective falling within the purview of a paragraph of Article XX, or go against that objective. 136 In US-Shrimp, the US banned the importation of shrimps or shrimp products except for those harvested under conditions that do not adversely affect sea turtles or in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a nation certified pursuant to US law. The AB held that the ban constituted 'arbitrary' and 'unjustifiable' discrimination because the US failed to engage the WTO members exporting shrimp to the US in serious negotiations with the objective of concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements to protect and conserve sea turtles. 137 Nevertheless, the requirement for serious negotiation did not require the successful conclusion of an agreement. 138 The ban lacked flexibility and failed to consider the different situations of various WTO members. 139 WTO jurisprudence has identified three criteria to determine whether a nonconforming measure is a 'disguised restriction on international trade'. Firstly, whether the contested measure is published. In US-Gasoline, the AB held that a restriction in international trade that is concealed or unannounced constituted a 'disguised restriction'. 140 Secondly, whether the application of a non-conforming measure is arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminatory may be taken into account in determining the presence of a 'disguised restriction on international trade'. 141 Thirdly, the 'design, architecture and revealing structure' of the measure must be examined to discern whether it is intended for protective application. 142 Notably, WTO jurisprudence has been criticised for enforcing trade rules without acknowledging human rights. 143 The typical examples are China-IP Rights 144 and China-Audiovisual Products. 145 China's Internet censorship is equally applied to both domestic and foreign ISPs, so it may not violate the national treatment under the WTO. 146 Its censorship is openly published as law. For example, when an Internet information search service provider finds results which contain any information or applications prohibited by any Chinese law or regulation, it will cease the search, retain records and report to the State Internet Information Office or the local Internet information office in a timely manner. 147 Further, the market access obligation under China's W/120 adopts a positive list. The limited commitments that China has made to Internet services significantly increase the difficulty of linking international trade law with human rights protection. 148 Nevertheless, China will wait to see how the exceptions in Article 14.11.3 of the TPP will be interpreted and whether the international commitment to cross-border transfer of electronic information can help remove domestic restrictions on freedom of speech.",

TPP members cannot require a covered person to use or locate local computing facilities as a precondition for doing business in its territory. 149 Banning localisation of computing facilities is a compulsory obligation for TPP members and also subject to the same exceptions as the cross-border transfer of electronic information. 150 Free cross-border transfer of electronic information focuses on preventing a government from keeping data outside of its border by measures such as censorship. 151 Industry and Internet advocates argue that localisation may pose a more serious threat to the Internet than censorship, because it 'threatens the major new advances in information technology-not only cloud computing, but also the promise of big data and the Internet of Things'. 152 Recently, China has taken steps towards economy-wide requirement of data localisation. 153 For example, in China, a book, audiovisual, electronic, newspaper or periodical publisher who provides online publishing services must localise its servers and storage devices in China's territory. 154 In 2013, the Standardisation Administration and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine published new national standards that prohibit overseas transfers of data to any entity, absent express user consent, government permission or other explicit legal or regulatory permission. The 2016 China Internet Security Law also requires that personal information and important data collected by key telecommunication infrastructure operators or generated during their operations in China shall be stored in the China territory. 155 The underlying policies for data localisation are to ease security concerns, combat rampant identity theft and diminish illegal trade in personal data. According to a survey conducted by the European Centre for International Political Economy, localisation may decrease China's GDP by 1.1% and reduce China's exports by 1.7% due to loss of competitiveness, create $63 bn of welfare losses and lower the average month salary per worker by 13%. 156 However, localisation helps ensure data providers' adherence to Chinese law and the government's socialist values. 157 Chinese courts can exercise personal jurisdiction based on the location of the server. 158 For the Chinese government, these political and ideological values outweigh the economic costs of data localisation.",

Annex IV (non-conforming measures for state-owned enterprises and designated monopolies) of the TPP does not apply to e-commerce. 161 However, in China, Internet connection services are run by wholly state-owned telecommunications service providers and are thus not open to foreign suppliers. 162 International communications services must be conducted through international communications gateways, the establishment of which must be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry. 163 No entity or individual may engage in international communications by any other means. 164 The country's international network traffic comes in and leaves exclusively through three international Internet exits: Beijing (using Qingdao's ocean optic fiber cable), Shanghai and Guangzhou (using Shantou's ocean optic fiber cable). 165 Up to January 2015, there was a large 155 Art. 37 of the China Internet Security Law. 156 163 Ibid., Art. 6. 164 Ibid. 165 Zhang (2015) . population of netizens, approximately 649 million in China. 166 These factors create a veritable bottleneck for international Internet bandwidth, meaning the Internet connection charge is high while speed is low. 167 In this context, Chinese stateowned Internet connection service providers may not have incentives to negotiate on a commercial basis with foreign competitors.",

This digital divide may split the development of international trade law for e-commerce. In the post-TPP era period, the making of international trade law for e-commerce in the Asia-Pacific will occur in a polycentric pattern. 184 FTAs concluded by China and the US respectively may converge in terms of classification and treatment of digital products and protection of consumers and privacy. However, they may openly conflict on regulation of free flow of information (Fig. 2) . In a polycentric pattern, systems of functionally overlapping international institutions may affect each other's operations. 185 The different e-commerce regulation regime established by China, especially in the field of free flow of information, will compete with the US regime to attract participants, gain trading volume or develop new strategies. 186 The FTAs in the polycentric pattern are heterarchically ordered and none can impose their regulation upon the entire regime. 187 In a few industries, privately-owned Chinese enterprises have actively advocated their voice in international rule-making. E-commerce is one example. 188 Jack Ma, Alibaba Group Executive Chairman and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General, is calling for the establishment of an Electronic World Trade Platform ('eWTP') to help small to medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs'), developing countries and young people to enter the global market and join the global economy. 189 eWTP would link local, regional, national and international e-commerce Internet platforms. 190 It facilitates SMEs compliance with various government regulations on products, customs procedures and provides better access to logistics and financing. 191 According to Jack Ma, the eWTP is a logical and natural complement Fig. 1 (monocentric) : The big circle refers to the TPP, which aims to set the 21st century standard for e-commerce laws. The small ones refer to other FTAs in Asia Pacific.",

Nevertheless, e-commerce rules proposed by Chinese enterprises may possibly be commercially-oriented. The rules will protect consumer and privacy but will not touch upon free flow of information which may have human rights connotations. A similar approach seems to be adopted by Facebook. According to the New York Times, in 2016, Facebook quietly built software to censor news feeds in specific geographic areas to prepare the company for entry into China. 196 In a polycentric system, private entities develop informal law 197 that impacts the development of international trade law for digital products. China is one of the largest and most lucrative markets for all e-commerce companies. Private entities are profit-making and may be publicly held. The market power may allow them to promote free flow of information while carving out human rights implications (Fig. 3) . 198 As Professor William W. Burke-White argued, 'new pluralism is emerging'. 199 In the polycentric pattern, the pluralism is not only of governments but also of non- governmental entities. 200 E-commerce rules supported by China and its enterprises may accept classification of digital products and provide better consumer and privacy protections, moving towards its American counterparts. However, they will be very cautious to incorporate rights for free flow of information, or alternatively they may support free flow of information devoid of any human rights implications. The abandonment of the TPP may give China an opportunity to reassert its preeminence in the development of international trade law for e-commerce. The big circles refer to FTAs. The small circles refer to e-commerce rules made by nongovernmental bodies, such as NGOs and enterprises.",
