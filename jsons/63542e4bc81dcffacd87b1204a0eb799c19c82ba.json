This paper considers the influence of the SARS epidemic on children's routines and behaviour when preschools re-opened, after a sixweek closure. Observations were made in 20 kindergartens and principals of another 10 kindergartens completed questionnaires. The influence of SARS was evident in all preschools, be it through teachers and students wearing masks, notices on hand washing or the provision of alcohol dispensers for hand disinfection. The outbreak impacted noticeably upon children's routines and social exchanges. In all schools, physical contact among children and sharing of food were not allowed. Children were also prohibited from talking to their peers when they had removed their masks. The SARS outbreak provided us a \"natural experiment\" to consider the influence of epidemics on preschools.",

            "text": "During the past 100 years, there have been five killer viruses, including the Spanish flu (1918) , the Asian Flu (1957), the Hong Kong flu (1968), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (2003) and the Avian Flu (2004) (Dunne, 2005) . Flu pandemics have led to the closure of schools as it is assumed that infectious diseases can be rapidly transmitted in school premises. Previous research indicates that school closure reduces the incidence of viral respiratory diseases among children during an influenza outbreak (Heymann, Chodick, Reichman, Kokia & Laufer, 2004) . It has been suggested that one of the reasons that Hong Kong flu (1968) was less deadly than the Spanish and Asian influenzas is that it peaked during the school holidays and children did not spread the virus in school. Research also indicates that Upper Respiratory Infections (URIs) are much more common in preschool children in centre-based care than those who are looked after at home (NICHD ECCRN, 2005) . Hence, medical research indicates that preschool closure prevents the spread of viral respiratory diseases and that children in centre-based care are more susceptible to URIs. On the other hand, because of the nature of transmission mechanisms, there is an extremely small likelihood that viruses like HIV/AIDS will be spread in preschools.",

The list of 'Dos' includes having a curriculum that covers moral, cognitive, physical, social, and aesthetic aspects of development by organizing activities that promote all-round development; organizing various child-centred learning activities; using the mother tongue as the language of instruction, and respecting individual differences. Good programs in any country achieve all these goals, but some are especially pertinent to Hong Kong idiosyncrasies.

In the past, the Chinese teacher was characterised as a fountain of knowledge who force-fed Peking ducks. However, children spend more time in play-based learning now than in the past and there has been a corresponding decrease in expository teaching. It appears that traditional Chinese cultural beliefs about early learning have taken a back seat to what is considered as good educational practice. Cultural beliefs about childhood and education also influence pedagogy. For example, kindergartens tend to have highly structured days. This is partly due to children's age, but also a reflection of Chinese cultural beliefs about the early years being a time for training young children to be disciplined and behave properly (Rao, McHale & Pearson, 2003) .",

Did children really need to face the wall while eating their snack? However, these behaviours must be considered in the light of the general context. At the time of the SARS outbreak, there were many unknowns about the transmission of SARS, and there was panic in the general population. Hong Kong's typically crowded streets were less so, and about 30% of the population was wearing surgical masks. A 14-year-old boy played a prank on the internet and indicated that the territory was going to be quarantined. This led to panic buying and supermarkets ran out of basic supplies. It is also important to re-iterate that Hong Kong is a very densely populated city and this can lead to fairly rapid transmission of viruses.",

SARS led to modifications in school activities, and all extra-curricular activities such as school trips were cancelled. There was, not surprisingly, an increased awareness about SARS and how to prevent it as a result of visual displays and curriculum changes. There was more small-group teaching and less social interaction among children. In hindsight, we can consider whether some of the changes which resulted in decreased social interaction among children were really necessary.

Additional clusters were also subsequently linked to the hotel. SARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the outbreak hit Hong Kong's hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first victims as they struggled to save lives.
