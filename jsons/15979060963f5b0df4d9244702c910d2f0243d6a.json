The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof potential clinical tool, including phototherapy-one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 \"Spanish influenza\" pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400 -470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder. The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.",

Dubbed \"Spanish influenza\", the disease spread quickly, ravaging the world at a time that there were no antibiotics and medicine-as a field-was essentially infantile in its development. Without the benefit of modern technology, data keeping was poor, making it difficult to have accurate mortality and morbidity figures; but even then, estimates suggest that the flu killed 1% to 3% of its victims, with the mortality rate reaching 10% in some communities [1] [2] [3] . While a 1991 report [3] put the death toll in the range of 24.7 -39.3 million, and related morbidity estimates between 25% and 90%, recent publications suggest that 50 -100 million died as a result of the pandemic [1, 4] .",

The Finsen lamp became widely popular and was adopted in most of Europe and North America, earning Finsen the Nobel Prize in 1903. Finsen himself acknowledged the healing power of sunlight but erroneously assumed that his lamp took advantage of the UV spectrum of radiation. It is quite conceivable that his pioneering work spurred many in the healthcare industry to use sunlight to treat victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic and beyond.

Perhaps the earliest record of sunlight as medical treatment dates back to the time of Egyptian Pharaohs-more than 5000 BC-as evidenced by images, archeological findings and artifacts [23] [24] [25] [26] . A popular ancient Egyptian image clearly shows a family exposing themselves to the healing rays of the The Greeks and the Romans clearly recognized the healing power of the sun. They built solariums and sunbaths, and the Greeks even used them to enhance the strength of athletes preparing for the Olympic Games by exposing them to several months of sunlight treatment. The word, heliotherapy, actually derives from the Greek name for their sun god, \"Helios;\" heliotherapy meaning sunlight therapy [23] [24] [25] [26] . Furthermore, Ayurvedic medical records show that as far back and 1400 BC; Hindus used the combination of sunlight and photosensitive herbs, such as furocoumarins, to treat vitiligo and other conditions-a combined treatment, which many refer to today as photodynamic therapy [27] . Moreover, records indicate that heliotherapy was a cardinal method used in early Daoism, which Lingyan Tzu-Ming introduced in China during the early as 1877, studies showed that UV killed anthrax bacilli [11] , and by 1890, it was determined that it played a role in rachitis, rickettsia and peritoneal tuberculosis [11, 16, 29] . By this time, lamps generating light from quartz, mercury vapor and other sources were built and used to treat acne, psoriasis, syphilis, leprosy, and pellagra, among others [11, 17, 25] . Three years later, Finsen began to use filtered sunlight to treat lupus vulgaris and through careful documentation published his Nobel-winning work, in 1901. The use of lamps and other artificial light sources to treat skin diseases continued well into the second half of the 20 th century, but was quickly overtaken by easy availability of potent antibiotics, which became popular for their quick results and ease of use [11, 25] .",

Today, photobiomodulation, which takes advantage of the photochemical effects of low power lasers, LEDs and other monochromatic sources of light to treat various diseases and ailments, has evolved scientifically, allowing evidence-based practice. This development now enables clinicians and others to exploit the specific effect of each wavelength or spectrum of light for treatment purposes. Detailed below are several studies, which show that we do not need UV to kill bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, and that safer wavelengths adjacent to UV, such as violet or blue light, are antimicrobial against microorganisms. Furthermore, evidence shows that red and near infrared light have immense therapeutic value as well, and can be effective in treating a range of ailments, including the respiratory complications of coronavirus disease.",

An analysis of the Nobel-winning work of Finsen, supports these blue light studies, because it shows that the Finsen Lamp, used to heal many with tuberculosis infection, did not produce UV as Finsen believed; rather, it produces light in the violet/blue range [59] (Figure 2) . Just as an analysis of Finsen's lamp makes it clear that its effect was due to violet/blue light and not UV, so a thought analysis of the radiation from the sun renders vivid the fact that the bactericidal effect of sunlight, often ascribed to UV, is due to the immense amount of blue light reaching the earth from the sun. Atmospheric ozone substantially absorbs solar UV rays, allowing transmission of violet/blue light to the surface of the earth. Indeed, the peak transmission at the surface of the earth is in the blue region, and together with violet light, is 10 times more than the amount of UV reaching the surface of the earth [80] . Given the absorption of violet blue light by most microbes and the resulting bactericidal effect, it seems reasonable to attribute a good proportion of the sun's environmental sanitization power to the violet blue spectrum of radiation, and not UV as many assert.",

            "text": "Recent works now show that there may be as many as four mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial effect of blue light. The first and most well-grounded of which is that blue light triggers endogenous bacterial chromophores such as porphyrins, flavins, NADH and other photosensitive receptors to produce reactive oxygen species, which in adequate amount results in cell death [39, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Indeed, porphyrins with absorption peaks in the 405 to 470 nm range have been identified in microbial cells [39, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . In three recent papers [34- The second mechanism, which is continuing to gain traction, is that irradiation with blue light alters bacterial cell membrane integrity with a consequent decrease in membrane polarization and rapid alteration of cellular functions [64] . Our recent electron microscopic study affirms this finding. It shows that even at a sub-lethal dose level, treatment with pulsed blue 450 nm light disrupts the structural architecture of MRSA cell membrane and its internal organelles.",

[86] induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and then treated the animals with red 660 + 20 nm light (5 J cm -2 radiant exposure and 33 mW cm -2 irradiance) daily for eight days, beginning from day 14. They found that the treatment reduced collagen production and the number of inflammatory cells in the alveoli, decreased interstitial thickening, and static as well as dynamic pulmonary elasticity. Further, cultures of pneumocytes and fibroblasts obtained from the animals showed downregulation of pro-inflammatory cells and collagen deposits in the lungs [86] . Another study of the same murine model showed that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof infrared 780 nm light reduced inflammation and collagen deposits in the lungs of mice, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated the secretion of IL-10 from fibroblasts and pneumocytes. Moreover, it significantly reduced total lung TGF\u03b2 [87] . Taken together, these early results suggest that red and near infrared light have the potential to reduce some of the critical complications of coronavirus infections, i.e., pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis. The preliminary nature of these results and the need for improved experimental methods and data reporting should not diminish their significance; rather it should draw attention to another spectrum of light that may be beneficial in the ongoing fight against coronavirus diseases that seems to challenge healthcare systems worldwide.",

The rapid spread of COVID-19 and its clear capacity to kill on a massive scale obviously justify deployment of treatments that seem to work, even though their underlying mechanisms are not clear. Thus, given the potential capacity of red and near infrared light to reduce the lifethreatening respiratory complications of COVID-19, it goes without saying that every effort should be made to advance the work so that an effective therapy can be fashioned from the body of research work achieved to date. It will be a wise investment to urgently investigate these initial results clinically, and not wait for another deadly coronavirus pandemic to remind us of the inherent potential of light as a therapeutic tool. The urgency of this call is heightened by recent clinical results, which indicate that patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and others with bronchial asthma and allergy improved significantly following treatment with light [91, 92] .",

            "text": "Already, fresh off the press is an early report that the common cold virus-a coronavirus-is inactivated by light [98] . In this recent study, broad spectrum light-mimicking sunlight-was tested on aerosolized influenza virus at 20% and 70% relative humidity, while the decay constant and half-life of the virus were measured as indices of survival. The results showed that relative humidity had no effect. The simulated sunlight alone significantly inactivated the virus, resulting in 0.29 + 0.09 min -1 decay constant and a half-live of approximately 2.4 minutes compared to non-irradiated controls, which had 0.02 + 0.06 min -1 decay constant and 31.1 min half-life. The resulting 93% increase in decay constant and the concomitant 92.3% decline in half-life due to light is impressive. This is supported by news report of a recent US Department of Homeland Security study, which showed that exposure to the sun kills COVID-19-a more virulent form of the common influenza virus [99] . These recent developments buttress the suggestion that blue light, in particular, pulsed blue light, which recent reports have shown to be 40 to 100 times more potent the commonly available continuous wave blue light [34] [35] [36] , has great potential to inactivate COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, in addition to suppressing related opportunistic bacterial infections. This recent finding further elevates the urgency to explore the potential of blue light as an antiviral agent. When convincing clinical results prove that blue light is antiviral, in addition to being antibiotic against coronavirus opportunistic bacteria, it would be a revolutionary paradigm shift, considering the ubiquity of low cost blue light emitting devices and the low risk involved in terms of safety.",

Thus, when M\u00f8ller et al. measured the radiation transmitted through the Finsen lens systems, and the absorption of the stain solution filters in the lamps relative to the lamp's effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they found that the lens and filters absorbed UV wavelengths below 340 nm[59]. Moreover, the methylene blue solution used to absorb the heat generated by the system also blocked the transmission of wavelengths below 340 nm, as well as light in the 550 -700 nm range; thus, allowing predominant transmission of light in the UV-A and violet/blue range[57]. Furthermore, the fluorescence of M. tuberculosis shows the presence of endogenous porphyrins, known to absorb blue light and engender the production of reactive oxygen species and bacterial suppression, not UV absorption[39,46-48,60-  79].This clearly explains Finsen's success in treating tuberculosis, implying that unbeknownst to the world, the 1903 Nobel Prize was awarded to Finsen for demonstrating the antimicrobial effect of blue light. Therefore, the only logical explanation of Finsen's success is that endogenous porphyrins in tuberculosis bacteria absorbed the violet/blue light predominantly transmitted through his lamp system; the absorption triggered downstream production of reactive oxygen species, thus killing the bacteria and curing his patients of tuberculosis, not UV light absorption as the Nobel laureate assumed.",

The outcome was impressive. The dominant chromophores in P. acnes and MRSA emit red light with peak emission between 612 and 660 nm when excited with blue/violet light [36,46,47,64]. Thus, by monitoring the fluorescence-red glow-emitted by both bacteria, we were able to correlate bacterial kill rate with quantitated amounts of remnant bacterial colonies. Not only did it show bacterial suppression, it revealed that their red fluorescence diminished as bacterial colonies were depleted and vice versa [36], further affirming the theory that porphyrins play a major role in antimicrobial blue light treatment.",
