In human infectious diseases, such as avian influenza, the limited sample size of affected patients represents an additional hurdle for the discovery of susceptible/resistance genes via GWASs. The eQTLs are currently the most abundant and systematically surveyed class of functional consequence of genetic variation [18, 21]. The local eQTLs (cis-eQTLs) tend to have larger effect on gene expression than distant eQTLs (trans-eQTLs) [22].

Posttranslational cleavage of HA by host protease is a prerequisite for the fusion and hence for virus infectivity, tissue tropism, and virus pathogenicity. Most human influenza A virus strains, including H1N1 and H3N2 have a single arginine at the HA cleavage site by trypsin-like proteases, which are mainly present in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract [24]. TMPRSS2 is the major host protease that cleaves and activates the HA of influenza viruses in the human respiratory tract [25]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as subtypes H5 and H7, are cleaved at the multibasic motif by ubiquitous cellular proteases and cause lethal systemic infection [26]. Despite their avian virus origin, the novel A(H7N9) viruses possess a monobasic HA cleavage site [27], consistent with their low pathogenicity in poultry. TMPRSS2-deficient mice were highly tolerant to the lethal challenge of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) viruses, demonstrating the essential role of TMPRSS2 in the pathogenesis of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H7N9) virus infections [20].",

The same dose of virus in a greater inoculation volume can optimally deliver the viruses to the lower respiratory tract and caused more severe diseases in ferrets [34].

The discovery of TMPRSS2 as a susceptibility marker for the severe A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza and human A(H7N9) influenza will help identify high-risk individuals for better prophylactic and therapeutic intervention.",
