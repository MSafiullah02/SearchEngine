Spain is the country of the European region that has been most affected by the infection, accounting for 140,510 cases and 13,798 deaths by April 8th (3) . From the beginning of the pandemic, one of the main concerns to deal with was the complexity and excessive time to results of the diagnostic test, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Few clinical microbiology laboratories were prepared at this time to process such a massive volume of samples that grew exponentially. In our hospital, which is a middle sized center (440 beds), from March 5th to April 6th, a total of 7,453 respiratory samples (the vast majority nasopharyngeal exudates) were processed for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, reaching a positivity rate between 20 and 40%. Another added problem was the low positivity rate of nasopharyngeal samples in patients presenting a clinical syndrome compatible with COVID-19 in the second and third week of infection (1, 4) , which is generally the period in which patients get worse and are admitted to the hospital (1). On the other hand, most patients present a non-productive cough (5); this fact, together with the high risk of generating aerosols in bronchoscopies explains that most respiratory samples came from the upper respiratory tract, where the virus concentration is lower beyond the first week after the onset of symptoms (6,7). As a consequence, the positivity rate of the PCR in these patients could be lower than expected and many of them were hospitalized with a provisional diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology and possible COVID-19.",
