These resolutions apply to all businesses in Dubai and its free zones, excluding the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) which has its own employment legislation. The Employment Stability Resolution will remain on place for as long as the current precautionary measures are required. It says that affected employers shall progressively take the following five steps to navigate through this pandemic (steps 3, 4 and 5 requiring employee consent): (1) implement remote working; (2) grant paid leave; (3) grant unpaid leave; (4) arrange a temporary salary reduction; and finally (5) arrange a permanent salary reduction (mohre.gov.ae 2020).",

            "text": "A key change introduced by the Employment Stability Resolution was the creation of a Virtual Labour Market (mohre.hyrdd.com 2020) to manage surplus labour. Unlike in the past, where employees\u2019 career decisions were bound to employers\u2019 sponsorship, the Virtual Labour market provides greater flexibility and autonomy to expatriates to switch jobs. While firms in need of temporary workers are expected to use this platform to announce job vacancies, current job seekers can also apply through the system. The Ministry manages the Virtual Labour Market as an electronic platform to manage expatriates\u2019 movement by issuing temporary work permits for those employees who transfer their employment to another employer.",

To ensure the needs of the international workforce are met, the government has introduced flexible visa schemes which, for the first time, allow expatriates to remain in the country until the end of 2020, even if they have lost their job.",

To remain competitive, the ability to attract and retain new skills and competencies will remain critical. The introduction of new measures, such as the Virtual Labour Market, will most likely remain in place post Covid-19. The combination of a lower degree of central control and a higher level of flexibility may be the renaissance of global talent management in Dubai\u2019s labour market. Working remotely and more independently will become a new norm to be addressed in labour market structures post Covid-19. Taking it all together, the new level of flexibility introduced into Dubai\u2019s employment market is likely to result in (1) stronger competition for jobs and talent, (2) increased flexibility of work, space and time, (3) active support to assist individuals to find jobs and (4) increased investment in talent retention.",
