S. aureus is a common microorganism found on human skin, and it is one of the most common causative pathogens of both community-and hospitalacquired infections [8] . S. aureus is often associated with a variety of infectious conditions such as bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, urinary tract infections among others [9] . Treatment of S. aureus associated infections can be challenging due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [10, 11] . P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are recalcitrant ESKAPE Gram-negative bacteria that exemplify current highly problematic clinical pathogens causing serious infections in hospital and community settings, due to the rapidly acquired multidrug resistance (MDR), the formation of biofilms and antibiotic tolerant/persister (AT/P) cells [12] . They are globally prevalent and, more importantly, the mortality associated with MDR resistant infections caused by these bacteria is especially high (39 and 80%, respectively; 13 and 14] . A. baumanni survives for prolonged periods under a wide range of environmental conditions and causes outbreaks of infection and health care-associated infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, and wound infection. InfA and BVDV are enveloped, single strand RNA viruses, similar to SARS-CoV2. However, BVDV is likely harder to eradicate due to its small size (40-60 nm) and has been shown to persist for up to 3 weeks in farm slurry at 5\u00b0 C [15] . PPV is a small, non-enveloped, DNA virus (18-24 nm), which is known to be more resistant to disinfection than enveloped viruses and bacteria (Figure 1 ).",

In a different guidance document entitled 'Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (March 2020), three levels of disinfection are clearly defined based on the activity of the disinfection method against different pathogens. According to these definitions, a 'low' level of disinfection could be obtained by the demonstration of 6log 10 reduction of each of the typical vegetative organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and representatives of the Klebsiella and Enterobacter genus. This level of disinfection is described as 'a lethal process utilizing an agent that kills vegetative forms of bacteria, some fungi, and lipid viruses'. According to this guidance and definitions, moist heat decontamination under the tested conditions here is likely to provide low level disinfection.",

Moist heat decontamination under these conditions has been shown previously to preserve fit and filter efficiency for N95 respirators [2] . One of the factors to be considered while evaluating the merits of different decontamination methods is the number of possible decontamination cycles before the fit, filter efficiency or efficacy of bioburden reduction is compromised. Other factors are the use patterns of the respirators in between decontamination treatments and whether the respirators are returned to the original users after decontamination. These factors may affect the performance and the risk of failure of these decontaminated respirators. There is little information on the effect of multiple decontamination cycles using moist heat decontamination under these conditions, but a recent non-peer reviewed study suggests that the filter efficiency may be maintained up to 20 cycles [16].",
