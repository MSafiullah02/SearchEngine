Maintaining physical and mental health is the fundamental element of reinforcing the armed forces, rapidly recovering from injury, and of regenerating the fighting capacity. The aim of military medical research is to serve the people and to manage people-related health problems. Traditionally, injury from weapons is called \u201ctrauma\u201d but can be associated with many serious complications and can cause systematic reactions and internal organ damage. These damages are the central part of war injuries but has similarities with diseases in usual healthcare; sometimes these damages are called disease trauma, injury and illness, as well as injury complicated with disease. Modern war can not only create somatic trauma and associated diseases but also involve psychological trauma. Therefore, military medicine refers to traditional military field surgery or internal medicine as well as the overall health of military staff, particularly how to manage mental stress. Currently, military surgery and internal medicine research emphasize the reform of first aid skills and equipment, regenerative medicine, etc.",

In addition, military aviation medicine was established in 1949. Many types of aviation medical equipment have been developed by the military service in China in relation to much basic and applied research into mental health, aviation physiological training, pilot selection and unhealthy effects from hazardous aviation environments [5]. Because the space program in China has been established for more than 40 years, aviation medical-engineering technology has rapidly developed and now has more than 13 branches, including aviation environmental medicine, cell biology, and psychiatry [6].

In the area of detecting, preventing and managing microbiological agents, military medical research in China has reached the international level but should continue developing specialized military supply systems with minimal side effects.

Using modern pharmacological research methods, such as molecular biology, molecular pharmacology, bio-neurology, bio-physics, cell biology, natural medical chemistry and computer science, scientists should increase the intensity of research into traditional medicine, focusing on selecting traditional drugs that fit the requirements of modern war.",

Scientists should base their policy on the requirements of future war, through appropriate cooperation with civilian research resources, emphasizing the selection and education of a special military medical branch, with deepening and widening directions. In 2010, a proposal concerning the further deepening of military\u2013civilian cooperation was published by the Ministry of Health; the General Logistics Department of PLA; education, health, and national traditional medicine departments; the National Food and Drug Control Administration; the China Science Institute; and by the China Academy of Engineering. Scientists must rely on national resources in developed and advantaged areas to widen the range of military medical research with full-dimension development. To form a solid base for future medical research, scientists also must attract military or civilian researchers and experts.",
