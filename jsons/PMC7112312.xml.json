Their ages ranged from 32 to 79 years (median, 47.5 years). CVID was characterized by decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (>2 SDs less than the age-adjusted mean), defective in vitro antibody formation, and exclusion of other known causes of humoral immune defects. The diagnosis of XLA was based on early-onset, very low serum immunoglobulin concentrations; male sex; and a lack of circulating mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and mutation analysis of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene.5 All patients were receiving regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy (dose, 400-600 mg/kg/mo). The trough serum IgG concentration was greater than 5 g/L in all patients; 9 patients had serum IgG levels of 6.0 g/L or greater. No patients were receiving prophylactic antibiotic treatment at the beginning of the study. All patients were nonsmokers.",

Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen in respiratory tract infections, and results for it were positive in one third of the infections. Rhinovirus was found both as a sole pathogen and also together with bacteria. Rhinoviruses have been shown to induce proinflammatory response in the lower airways.11, 12, 13 Chronic inflammation might predispose patients to a progression of pulmonary changes, even if the immunoglobulin replacement therapy is adequate.14 Previously, chronic rhinoviral infection with the same virus in the lower respiratory tract has been described in immunocompromised lung transplant recipients.15 In immunocompetent adults rhinoviral clearance is usually rapid, on average 1 to 2 weeks.7, 16 In immunocompetent children rhinoviral shedding has been shown to persist for up to 3 weeks, but prolonged shedding for months has not been documented in immunocompetent subjects.17 Consequently, continuous viral RNA detection for months suggests active replication and persistent infection. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results were positive for more than 2 months. Frequent rhinoviral infections raise the question of the possible role of the absence of secretory IgA in the defense against rhinoviruses.",

Echoviruses were the most common enteroviruses. In only 5 patients were enteroviruses documented in the respiratory tract.3 A more recent report of 201 patients with XLA also showed that enteroviruses were the most common causes in central nervous system infections.22 Several vaccine- and non\u2013vaccine-associated poliomyelitis case reports have been published, and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported to chronically excrete poliovirus.23, 24, 25\n",

Btk is a cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and a member of the Tec family. Btk is important in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8 and TLR9 signalling. Both TLR8 and TLR9 are important in the activation of host defense against viral and bacterial infections. Defective triggering of TLRs leads to impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. TLR8 recognizes single-stranded RNA. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs that exist in both viral and bacterial DNA. Patients with XLA have impaired IL-6, which might explain their susceptibility to viral infections.33 Patients with CVID also presented with prolonged persistence of rhinovirus. Impaired IL-6 and IL-10 production, as well as TLR9 activation defects, have been demonstrated in patients with CVID.34 This might partly explain the persistence of rhinovirus.",
