Chronic pulmonary diseases and exacerbation of underlying pulmonary comorbidities were over-represented in the survived-without-ARDS group, suggesting that although these patients required oxygen supplementation, their prognosis was usually better than those who have respiratory decompensation due to viral pneumonitis. Thrombotic phenomena such as thrombosis in branches of pulmonary artery and splenic artery leading to wedged splenic infarct were found, which resembled those reported during the 1918 pandemic [36] . Although abdominal symptoms were reported to be an important clinical manifestation, and although an in vitro study showed that this virus could replicate to a high level in the intestinal cell line Caco-2 [21] , gastrointestinal symptoms were not prominent in our cases. As in patients who developed cytokine storm, shock requiring inotropic support and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome were frequent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 135, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study had several limitations. The frequent taking of clinical samples was prohibitive to the enrollment of children, and even adult patients occasionally refused serial nasopharyngeal or blood sampling. Viral load can be affected by minor differences in sampling technique, but this problem will affect all groups. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs may result in a lower viral load than nasopharyngeal aspirate, but very few of our samples were obtained by swabs. Because of the changing clinical status of individual patients, treatment regimen could not be unified and may confound the viral load and immunological profiles. In summary, a slower control of viral load and dysregulated cytokine profile are important in the pathogenesis of severe disease by this new pandemic virus. Preexisting immune impairment due to underlying diseases or genetic susceptibility in apparently immunocompetent cases should be investigated.
