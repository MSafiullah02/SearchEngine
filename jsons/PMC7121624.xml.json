            "text": "Ellipsometry was used already 1932 for studies of organic monolayers by Tronsted et al. [1], but Vroman [2], Rothen and Mathot [3] and Stromberg et al. [4] were most likely among the first to report measurements on protein layers. Azzam et al. [5] demonstrated similar results in studies of immunological reactions and also provided a theoretical framework. Their pioneering work included studies of kinetics of protein adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. These early investigators found ellipsometry to be a suitable tool for non-destructive analysis of thin films, both ex situ as well as in situ at a solid/liquid interface, but surprisingly the use of the technique for protein adsorption studies during the last 40 years has been limited to a few laboratories.1 In addition, with a few exceptions, the types of applications are generally very simple and often limited to single wavelength measurements. This may be due to that most users in the field have a background in biochemistry or medicine and not are sufficiently trained in optics and physics to make full use of the technique. The development in the field during this period has been reviewed several times [6\u201313].",

Studies under flow is an example on an additional possibility. It is no doubt that ellipsometry is a convenient and excellent tool to study surface dynamics in biological systems.

It is fair to say that the instrument problem is solved in this context.

This is a central challenge but is rather a biochemical issue than an ellipsometric. The main ellipsometric challenge is on the instrumental side. There are several concepts proposed but systems suitable for clinical tests are not readily available.

For a more flexible protein, conformation changes may occur upon adsorption but still one cannot expect an ideal homogeneous layer with flat parallel boundaries. Density is strongly related to n and various effective medium approximations (EMA) are used. A very simple density modeling can be done if n for a (more) dense protein layer is known as exemplified by determination of a density deficiency of 30% of a BSA layer on platinum [6] compared to a nominally dense BSA layer on HgCdTe. Ellipsometry can in principle provide n for thin layers as discussed above but it has not been proven yet to have sensitivity to resolve in-depth density profiles for protein monolayers as can be done with neutron reflectometry [39, 40].

Even if there is an order, an isotropic layer is normally assumed if the molecules not are uniaxial or biaxial. However, there are some indications that protein molecules can be uniaxial. Sano [43] showed that structural anisotropy in BSA leads to uniaxial molecules with n of 1.744 and 1.563 along the major and minor axes, respectively. In addition there may be form induced birefringence in protein layers as briefly discussed in the methodology section above. Of course, the resolving power of ellipsometry on protein films may be insufficient to resolve their anisotropy regardless of being intrinsic or form induced. In highly ordered, but thin films of fatty acids prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett techniques, Engelsen [44] demonstrated that anisotropic modeling is relevant. Future refinement of ellipsometric methodology will tell if anisotropy of protein films will add to further understanding of their properties and structure.",

The limited use of IRSE may be due to that the instrumentation is rather expensive and slow.

The idea of using ellipsometry as a sensor principle is therefore old and was also reviewed several years ago [46]. Several attempts to design systems for end users have been presented but have not been implemented in clinical laboratories so far. The Isoscope or comparison ellipsometer [47] and the fixedpolarizer ellipsometer [48] are two examples of suggested point-of-care systems. Also imaging ellipsometry were suggested many years ago as a high through-put system for biosensing [14, 49]. It seems that ellipsometry as a biosensor principle not finds its way from research to clinical laboratories. No user-friendly and cost-efficient instruments suitable for clinical use are commercially available. In spite of this, suggestions for biosensing applications continues to be published which indicates that researches are believers in its potential. The review will here be limited to presentation of some studies addressing two of the most important aspects in this context: (1) imaging ellipsometry readout for achieving high through-put and (2) bioaffinity for achieving specificity.",

Mikhaylova et al. used lysozyme and HSA as model proteins with different charge to probe complex adsorption responses on hydroxyl-terminated hyperbranched aromatic polyester thin films [68].

IRSE allows describing composition, structure and layer thickness in the same measurements. Ellipsometry is sometimes combined with other in situ techniques including potentiometry, impedance spectroscopy and quartz-micro balance (see also Chap. 17).
