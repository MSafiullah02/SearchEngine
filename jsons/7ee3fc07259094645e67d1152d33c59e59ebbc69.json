Some of these are present in very large numbers but cannot be grown, others can only be grown with difficulty in cell cultures. Enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, rotaviruses, parvovirus-like viruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses may be present in human excreta. Rotaviruses are the commonest cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in infancy and childhood. In children aged 6 months to 10 years, infection by rotaviruses occurs more frequently during winter months in temperate countries. In tropical countries, there is considerable variation in the incidence of rotavirus infections among children.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Enteroviruses include the polio, coxsackie A and B and echoviruses. These belong to the family of Picornaviridae. They contain singlestranded RNA. Poliomyelitis is rare in developed countries, as a result of the widespread use of oral polio vaccines, but continues to circulate in developing countries. Similarly, hepatitis A is an RNA virus and has the physicochemical characteristics of a typical enterovirus. It is transmitted from person to person by the faeco-oral route. Outbreaks may originate from viral contamination of food, water, milk and shellfish. Rotaviruses and parvovirus-like viruses cause gastroenteritis. The role of adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses and coronaviruses is not well-established. However, it is now recognized that these viruses can cause outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease.

Enteroviruses, including hepatitis A virus, adenovirus and rotaviruses, are frequently present in domestic wastewater. These viruses reflect those circulating in the community and depend on a number of factors, which include population, climate, seasonal and diurnal fluctuations and the presence of chemical effluents. Raw wastewater contains viral numbers which vary widely from country to country. For example, in raw wastewater in Israel, higher numbers are generally present than in the USA, although the numbers reported depend on the detection and concentration methods used. Animal viruses may also be present in raw wastewater from the faeces of household pets and effluents from farms, abattoirs and stormwater. The isolation of animal viruses from wastewater, especially abattoir wastes, has been reported by several workers.

For enterovirus assays, 0.1 -1 ml can usually be assayed conveniently.
