Yet, most of these antibodies have targeted surface antigens whose repertoire on solid tumors is limited. TCR-like antibodies, with high affinity and controlled specificity, could be ideal therapeutics.5, 11 To this end, several TCR-like antibodies targeting peptides derived from viral or tumor antigens in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 or HLA-A2 have been reported.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 In addition to their therapeutic values, they are desirable for characterizing specific peptide presentation on malignant and infected cells.",

The CHARMm force field was then used to perform energy minimizations and molecular dynamic simulations of the structure. The alignment of four scFv mutants (Supplementary Table S2) suggests Q50L in the heavy chain as the first critical position for affinity maturation. Q53L in the light chain of the best mutant (S3.3) was the second critical position. Based on homology modeling, these two glutamine residues located in CDR2 regions of heavy and light chains, respectively, were involved in antigen recognition.",

TCR-like antibodies were previously generated using hybridoma approaches13 or phage-display libraries.41 We started this investigation using a synthetic antibody gene library where the genes were recombinant. The affinity of TCR-like antibodies isolated from human antibody phage-display library was relatively low (50\u2013250 nM) and not always sufficient for therapeutic purposes.13 As tumors evade T-cell immunity by downregulating HLA antigens,42, 43, 44 affinity of TCR-like antibody is critical. In this study, we adopted an efficient yeast display system for affinity maturation: from the initial anti-WT1126/HLA-A2 scFv Clone45 with low affinity (KD=263 nM) to the final affinity-matured variant (KD=2.4 nM) representing a 100-fold improvement. Functionally, the parental Clone45 as either monovalent scFv or bivalent scFv-Fc did not recognize the naturally expressed WT1126/HLA-A2 epitope on tumor cells, even though it was able to recognize WT1126/HLA-A2 complexes loaded on the surface of T2 cells. Most importantly, the parental Clone45 scFv was not recognizable by tetramer in FACS analysis and did not mediate cytotoxicity either as scFv-Fc in ADCC or as CAR in transduced NK-92-MI cells or human T cells.",

The yeast display library was initially generated based on scFv Clone45 where the CDR residues were randomized and clones selected for enhanced binding to WT1126/HLA-A2 but not to irrelevant complexes. Using a minimal 20-fold to a maximal 100-fold affinity improvement boundary, three clones were selected. Using homology modeling, the simulated structure of scFv recognizing the HLA-A2-WT1126 complex was used to identify the two key residues responsible for interaction with the peptide motif, while residues facing the MHC helices were left unchanged. The final mutant, Q2L with two crucial leucine mutations at glutamine residues of CDR2 regions of the heavy and light chains, achieved a 100-fold improvement in affinity. It was noteworthy that the picomolar KD (2 pm) of Q2L as bivalent scFv-Fc was the highest among reported TCR-like antibodies (9.9\u2013294 nM).13 Two other groups have developed anti-WT1126/HLA-A2 antibodies with lower affinity, including the IgG1 ESK1 (100 pm\nKD)16 and the Fab fragments F2 (400 nM\nKD) and F3 (30 nM\nKD).18 We show that the high-affinity Q2L, with its long retention time (slow koff=3.55 \u00d7 10\u22124/S), was not just better at binding compared with the parental Clone45 (koff=7.18 \u00d7 10\u22122/S), it was also more effective in ADCC in vitro and had antitumor effect in vivo. Our studies showed that, in DKO mice, the addition of human effectors and cytokine could enhance the antibody effects and extend survival, most likely through Fc-receptor-dependent ADCC mechanisms in the presence of human NK cells and myeloid cells.",

Oren et al.18 also generated T-cell CARs with scFvs based on their low-affinity F2 (400 nM KD) and their moderate-affinity F3 (30 nM\nKD), and postulated that F3-CAR likely cross-reacted and led to poor viability, implying an affinity barrier to developing effective antipeptide/HLA CAR T cells.
