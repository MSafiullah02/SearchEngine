Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of both inpatient and outpatient pneumonia [1]. Moreover, the pneumonia-related mortality rate in CKD patients seems to be 14\u201316 times higher than in the general population [2]. In this article, we aim to explore the potential association between CKD and severity of COVID-19 infection.",
