The results indicated that the coding sequences of B5 and B9 share identical sequence (Fig. 3\n), which is composed of VH gene (351 bp) and VL gene (327 bp), and the two scFvs were uniformly designated as SA59B. The closest germline sequences for SA59B scFv-antibody gene could be identified by comparison with the database [13], [14], [15]. The VH gene use, the VH3 family-derived germline V3-23, D3-9, D7-27, and JH4b genes, while the VL gene uses the VL1 (V-kappa subgroup I, Vk-1) family-derived germline 02 (012) and Jk1 genes (Fig. 3). Also, a high degree of mutation appeared in the VHCDR2 (CDR, complementarity-determining region) with 70.6% (bases) and 58.8% (amino acids) sequence homology to the closest germline match (Table 1\n). In addition, there was a replacement mutation (position 282, T \u2192 G) that led to generation of a stop codon TGA in the VHFWR3 (FWR, functional framework region), which could surprisingly be suppressed when the scFv-phages were expressed in E. coli TG1 or HB2151. Any errors introduced during the amplification of DNA can be excluded, because we sequenced B5 and B9 scFvs repeatedly in two different companies (see Materials and methods) and obtained the same results. The deduced amino acid sequence of heavy and light chains of SA59B is shown in Fig. 3, and the predicted molecular weight of the whole soluble scFv was about 30 kDa.",

Their coding sequences shared the identical sequence composed of VH gene (351 bp) and VL gene (327 bp). Moreover, comparison with the closest Ig germline V genes showed that the VH gene was derived from VH3 family, and a high degree of mutation appeared in the VHCDR2 with 70.6% (bases) and 58.8% (amino acids) sequence homology to the closest germline match, which indicated that the VHCDR2 of SA59B scFv-antibody gene may be a critical region of specific binding of SA59B scFv to SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of this action was unknown, our study suggested that SA59B scFv-antibody or SA59B-HRP had a high binding specificity to SARS-CoV in ELISA. Since it reacted well with SARS-CoV, it is also conceivable that it might restore its binding properties in the form of fusion proteins after expression as soluble scFvs in E. coli HB2151 or labeling as scFv-horseradish peroxidase, which was described by others [16], [17], [18]. Notably, the SDS\u2013PAGE results of SA59B-HRP solution may also provide evidence for this point. The SA59B-HRP migrated as a single protein band on SDS\u2013PAGE, and it had an estimated molecular mass of 66.2 kDa, which was obviously less than 74 kDa, the total molecular weight of SA59B scFv-antibody (30 kDa) and HRP (44 kDa). Furthermore, the creation of scFvs fused to other protein is believed to lead to the formation of dimers [16], which should have greater avidity and stability than original monovalent scFvs, and can be used, for example, for detection purposes. At present, the laboratory tests that can be applied for routine diagnosis of SARS mainly include detecting viral genome by PCR involving in RT-PCR [19], [20], [21], [22] and RT-LAMP [23], and detecting serum antibodies using SARS-CoV from Vero cell culture by ELISA [24], [25], [26], IFA [27], [28], [29], and NT [2]. However, there is little progress in detection of SARS-CoV using scFv-antibodies. So, we anticipate that SA59B scFv-antibody or SA59B-HRP described here will be useful in detection of SARS-CoV.",
