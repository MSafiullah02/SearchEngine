Variations in ecological and climatic factors enhance the possibility of the emergence of new pathogens [1]. Moreover, the evolution of pathogens accelerates the emergence of the disease and worsens the predictability of disease invasion [2]. The diseases like HIV, Small pox, Rabies, Measles, Dengue, Cholera, etc. have been emerged since decades whereas Zika, Ebola, Chikungunya, MERS-CoV, etc. are recently invaded and spread worldwide within a short period of time. Communicable diseases become a potential burden to the socio-economic condition of developing and under developed countries [3]. Some neglected tropical diseases cause physical disabilities and even premature death to human which consequently slow down the economic productivity of a country [4], [5]. Not only human, infectious diseases also victimize the animals, birds causing depletion in economic and agricultural growth. Diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in fish, etc. cause huge economic losses in food, agriculture and aquaculture every year [6]. Moreover, the transmission of diseases among animals, birds, etc. create the possibility of infecting the human population. With the growing advancements in the modern transportation technology, infectious diseases spread in the distant parts of the world very quickly and become a global concern [7], [8].",

Several modelling frameworks such as deterministic, stochastic, agent based model, chain binomial model, spatial model, etc. have been employed to depict the disease transmission [9]. However, among these approaches, mathematical modelling in a deterministic setting gained considerable attentions perhaps because of its modelling and computational simplicity. In this approach, usually a set of ordinary differential equations are constructed with the assumption that the population under consideration is homogeneously mixed.",

            "text": "The investigation of the consequences of interventions is one of the major aspect in the context of infectious disease modelling. Incorporation of different intervention strategies into the model can be executed in different ways. For instance, to model the behavioural change such as awareness [10], [11], isolation [12], [13] or to study the impact of vaccination [14], an extra compartment is usually introduced in the model. On the other hand, in the context of vector borne disease modelling, incorporation of self protection such as use of bed net, application of vector repellent on skin, etc. [15] can be accomplished by introducing a control parameter to capture the reduction in the transmission rate. The application of different vector control strategies, treatment, etc. [16] can also be encapsulated by using a control parameter to capture the increase in the respective rates (mortality rate of vector and recovery rate). To quantify the efficiency as well as the outcomes of the control strategies mainly two popular techniques: optimal control, impulsive control have been applied in numerous studies [17], [18]. In optimal control technique, usually one can seek for a time dependent control parameter for which infection burden and the costs associated with the intervention of the disease is minimized [19], [20]. On the other hand, using impulsive control technique, the effect of non-continuous interventions such as weekly/monthly vector control, spraying of insecticides, etc. are evaluated [21], [22]. These techniques are very useful for the assessment of effectiveness of different intervention strategies in lowering or even eliminating the disease. However, the above mentioned methods are not so useful to analyse the situations where the key objective is to achieve a predetermined infected population after applying suitable control. From epidemiological point of view, attaining a predetermined disease prevalence is an important aspect for public health organizations. World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted proper strategies to achieve targeted disease prevalence for several emerging diseases. For instance, WHO implemented strategies: Stop TB and End TB to achieve targets of 50% reduction in the disease prevalence and disease induced mortality by 2015 and 95% reduction in TB deaths between 2015 and 2035 respectively in India [23], [24], [25].",

In the context of infectious disease modelling [35] applied Z-type dynamic control in a simple SI model and analysed the dynamics of the system. The author considered isolation of susceptible individuals through migration as the control measure and explored that the rate of migration can be designed by using Z-control method to control infectious disease. In contrast, Lacitignola et al. [36] recently studied the control of backward bifurcation phenomena using Z-type control mechanism in an SIR disease model, where they considered isolation of a portion of susceptible population by using suitable prevention measures such as masks, hand-washing, gargling, vaccination, etc. However, in the present study we consider a different kind of prevention measure: removal of susceptible population from infected region to a neighbouring infection-free region to control the disease spread. We consider a simple SI model and design a Z-type controlled system aiming to explore the disease dynamics and quantify the rate of removal of susceptible to maintain a specific disease prevalence.",

The demography of the population is considered in the model in order to study the long term behaviour of the system. Total population is partitioned into two compartments: susceptible(S) and infected(I) depending on the health condition of the individuals. Susceptible population is assumed to be recruited via birth, immigration, etc. at a constant rate \u039b. It is also assumed that population is decreased due to natural death at a rate \u03bc. To model the transition from susceptible to infected we consider non-linear incidence rate. There are several studies where non-linear incidence rate has been used to capture the saturated contacts or \u201cpsychological effect\u201d of the population [37], [38], [39]. Following the above mentioned literatures, we consider the incidence rate as \u03b2SIa+I, which essentially captures more restrained increase in incidence than that of bilinear incidence and exclude the possibility of unrestricted contact rate. Here \u03b2 represents the transmission rate and the parameter a is used to capture the saturation factor. We consider the following set of ordinary differential equation to represent the disease transmission mechanism: (2.1)dSdt=\u039b\u2212\u03b2SIa+I\u2212\u03bcSdIdt=\u03b2SIa+I\u2212\u03bcI,together with the initial conditions S(0)>0 and I(0)>0.",

Therefore the system (4.5) is an autonomous system and we can apply the standard linearization technique to study the dynamical properties. Here we consider the number of targeted infected population to be constant, Id(t)=Id=constant.

Therefore, instead of considering the Z-controlled system (4.1), if we apply Z-control to the two compartments SI model (2.1), the overall dynamics of these two controlled systems would not be changed in terms of achieving a desired abundance of infected. However, the inclusion of the new compartment, N(t) in our Z-controlled system helps to identify the differences between the isolation of susceptible individuals by using protecting masks, bed net, vaccine, etc. and the isolation of individuals through migration. In the new Z-control model (SIN) the preventive measure (spatial isolation/removal of a portion of susceptible population) can be incorporated more accurately. After introduction of the compartment N(t), we obtain an upper bound of the desired prevalence Id for which the biological feasibility of the equilibrium is preserved. If we wish to achieve a desired infected abundance below the threshold value then the Z-control method can be applied successfully. However, if the desired infected state is greater than that threshold, then the Z-control method will not work (will not preserve the positivity of the solution trajectories of the controlled system).",

In a similar manner, the condition (4.12) holds if c2>0 and \u03bb>c2B\u2212I(0) if c2<0. Hence, we can get bound for \u03bb according to the sign of c2.  \u25a1\n",

For example, we consider an epidemic situation (R0=1.5) with the initial populations (S,I,N)=(1000,50,1000). In such a situation, we fix Id=10 and simulate the system (4.5) along with the update parameter u(t) given in Eq. (4.3) using the in-built function ode45 in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014a). From Fig. 1, it is observed that by applying Z-control, the system (4.5) approaches towards the controlled equilibrium (Sc,Ic,Nc)=(1100,10,1390). The control parameter u(t) assumes positive values throughout the specified time interval (see Fig. 1). Positive value of u(t) indicates the removal of susceptible population from infected region to the infection-free region which is indeed practically feasible. Fig. 1 shows that removal of susceptible population from infected region to infection-free region can effectively achieve the targeted disease prevalence. Initially, 0.14% susceptible population should be removed and the percentage of removal increases from 0.14% to 0.16% between the time interval [0,760]. In the subsequent time interval ([761,4656]), the rate of removal decreases and achieve the desired infected population. It is to be noted that 0.04% population should be removed to maintain the targeted disease prevalence (see Fig. 1).",

We see from the Fig. 2 that the system (4.5) asymptotically converges to the controlled equilibrium (Sc,Ic,Nc)=(1000,0,1500). This implies that the disease eradication is possible by removing the susceptible population from the infected region to an infection-free region. Similar to the case described earlier, the removal rate gradually increases at the initial time period and attains the maximum value 0.3 and in the subsequent time it decreases and converges to zero (see Fig. 2).

If the data xi and y are rank transformed then the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) between xi and y is measured as the correlation coefficient between the residuals (xi\u2212x\u02c6i) and (y\u2212y\u02c6), where x\u02c6i and y\u02c6 follow some linear regression models [44]. By calculating PRCC, one can identify the influential parameters and investigate how they are correlated with the output.",

For each parameter 1000 samples are drawn from uniform distribution from a biologically relevant interval. The dynamics of the PRCC values between u(t) and the input parameters are depicted in Fig. 6. The temporal variations of the PRCCs are represented in three time intervals: (i) at initial time interval, (ii) the time interval when transitions occur and (iii) the time interval when system stabilizes (see Fig. 6). It is noted that u(t) and the natural death rate \u03bc are negatively correlated at the beginning and become positively correlated in the transition time and subsequently the correlation becomes negative. The transmission rate is positively correlated with u(t) throughout the time interval and specifically during the stabilization period the correlation becomes very high. Increase in transmission rate implies higher disease incidence therefore in higher endemicity situation the rate of removal (u(t)) should be higher to achieve the targeted disease state. This might be a possible reason for this positive correlation between \u03b2 and u(t). The design parameter \u03bb is positively correlated with u(t) initially and the correlation becomes negative during transient period and ultimately becomes uncorrelated as the system stabilizes. The recruitment rate of susceptible population in the infected region is always positively correlated with u(t). Since recruitment of susceptible increases the possibility of disease incidence and therefore the removal rate should be kept high to maintain a specified disease state. However the recruitment rate of susceptible in the infection free region does not possess any correlation with u(t). This observation is quite obvious since the rate of susceptible removal from infected region should not be dependent on how much population is recruited in the infection free region. The parameter a is negatively correlated and the correlation becomes highly negative when the system has achieved the desired state.",

Here we quantify the maximum value of u(t) (see Fig. 7(A)) and the final value of u(t) (see Fig. 7(B)) while achieving the desired infected density. We vary the force of infection and compute the basic reproduction number (R0) of the uncontrolled system which indicates the endemicity of the current epidemic. Then we vary the density of the targeted infected density and calculate the percentage of change among infected population and also note down the maximum value of update parameter u(t) and the end value of the update parameter when the Z-control is successful. The percentage of reduction in infection (i.e. relative cases reduction) for a successful implementation of Z-controller can be more informative than that of absolute value of reduction in infection. Now we use contour plot of the maximum value of u(t) and the end value of u(t). In X-axis we vary the target i.e. percentage of reduction in infected density and in Y-axis we vary the R0 (i.e. endemicity/infectiousness). This picture can give a better idea for application of Z-control method in various endemic situations (for different disease transmission rate) with different targets such as controlling up to a desired/predetermined disease prevalence. From Fig. 7(A) it is seen that if the required percentage of infection reduction increases then the maximum value of the removal rate (u(t)) increases quite expectedly to achieve the desired disease prevalence. In particular, say for R0=5 to achieve up to 40% case reduction maximum 0.05% susceptible population should be removed (see Fig. 7(A)). Further it is observed that to reduce 80% infection, maximum 0.25% susceptible population should be removed. It is also noted that to achieve comparatively low cases reduction say up to 30%, in different levels of endemicity (i.e. for different values of R0), the maximum value of the removal rate does not vary much. On the other hand, from Fig. 7(B) we observe that for a particular value of R0, if the required percentage of infected cases reduction increases then the end value of u(t) also increases. Similar to the case of maximum value of u(t) to achieve comparatively low cases reduction for different values of R0, a little variation in the end value of the removal rate is observed.",

However, in our study we have considered the spatial isolation of susceptible population, i.e., the removal of susceptible population from the infected region to a neighbouring infection-free region is considered as the prevention measure. We considered that a portion of susceptible population is removed from the region of infection which resulted lower contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. In the context of epidemic outbreak, our study considered a different kind of control measure on susceptible population and analysed various epidemiological queries using Z-control method.",
