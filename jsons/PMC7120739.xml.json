In the fetal liver, they develop and mature into B lymphocytes which mainly settles in epithelia, lung and gut-associated lymphoid tissues [14]. B-cell development at the early bone marrow-dependent stages is concentrated along the functional rearrangement process of the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) gene segments independently. This rearrangement process is capable of fabricating an extended B-cell repertoire, which is responsible for expressing a diverse pool of antibodies with an estimated diversity above 1012.",

The repertoire that exist at pre-antigen stimulation is categorised as the preimmune repertoire with an estimated 1012 unique antibody molecules found in the human body. This initial repertoire is sufficient to isolate antibodies against a wide range of antigens [2]. The diversity of the preimmune antibody repertoire is generated by the allelic diversity of the variable gene segments, V(D)J recombination, junctional diversification, pairing of both heavy and light chains, and, receptor editing [15].",

            "text": "V(D)J recombination is the primary somatic gene rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments prior to antigen exposure [15, 18]. This mechanism happens in variable regions of HC and LC which encodes the antigen recognition sites. The sequence of formation allows the HC to be assembled prior to the LC [19]. V(D)J recombination is initiated by the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks using recombination activating gene (RAG) proteins (RAG 1 and RAG 2) at specific recombination signal sequences (RSS). The absence of these RAG proteins can lead to the failure of lymphocyte development at progenitor stages where V(D)J recombination occurs [20, 21]. The recombination process is guided by a set of conserved flanking DNA sequences located next to the gene segments to ensure correct recombination. These flanking DNA sequences are known as RSS which are conserved heptamer and nanomer sequences separated by a spacer which is either 12 or 23 bp in length [4, 19]. The joining of two gene segments during V(D)J recombination will adapt the 12/23 rule. The V and J gene segments are flanked by a pair of 23 bp spacers while D gene segments have 12 bp spacers flanking at both ends. Therefore, this allows the joining of D gene segments to both V and J gene segments but ensures that V gene segments will not combine with J gene segments directly [4]. Binding of RAG proteins to the RSS allows the formation of complexes to initiate a DNA double-strand break (DSB) in between the gene segments and RSS. The breaks are later joined by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) proteins by the addition or deletion of nucleotides. This addition and deletion to the genes will further enhance the diversity of the variable regions by junctional diversification. However, not all genes produced after junctional diversification are functional, which will eventually lead to the death of these B cells [2]. The gene diversification process can also lead to the formation of B cell receptors that target self-antigens. This population of B cells that targets self-antigens will undergo a further editing process termed as receptor editing. Receptor editing functions to eliminate self-reactive B cells from the system. These B cells will be stimulated to undergo further V(D)J recombination in order to edit the receptors which further enhance the diversity of antibodies [18].",

            "text": "There is further antibody gene diversification that occurs post-antigen exposure with the ultimate aim to further diverse the repertoire. Upon exposure to antigens, antibodies perform a second wave of diversification to enhance the binding affinities against antigens via affinity maturation. Cumulative point mutations in both V regions of heavy and light chains induce affinity maturation of antibodies [2]. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) are the examples which lead to affinity maturation of the antibodies upon stimulation by antigens [22]. SHM diversifies the V regions and alter the affinity of antigen binding sites while CSR changes the heavy chain constant (CH) region to generate different antibody isotypes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM) [23, 24]. Both SHM and CSR are initiated by somatic mutations in V regions and constant regions respectively [25, 26]. It was also reported that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required by both SHM and CSR to trigger the mechanisms [27, 28]. AID is a 24 kDa protein that deaminates cytidine residues on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), not RNA or double stranded DNA (dsDNA) [23]. AID causes the formation of DNA lesions which is later repaired by multiple DNA repair pathways such as base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), and NHEJ proteins [29]. The role of AID in the diversification process is evident as AID deficient mice and humans are unable to carry out SHM and CSR [30]. Despite happening at the same stage of B cell differentiation, SHM and CSR are different biochemical processes which are mediated by different sets of enzymes [24]. SHM occurs in the germinal centers (GCs) while CSR can occur either inside or outside GCs [31\u201333].",

            "text": "SHM is a region specific mechanism which begins 150\u2013200 base pairs (bp) downstream from the transcription start site (TSS) and is detected as far as 2 kb within the intronic region between J and C exons [34, 35]. AID deaminates cytosine residues in the V regions where the products of deamination lead to uracil-guanine (U-G) mismatch. This mismatch is later repaired by DNA repair mechanisms such as base excision repair and mismatch repair [36]. Incorporation of point mutations by SHM in V(D)J exons of both HC an LC helps to improve antibody affinities [37]. SHM occurs at a frequency of 10\u22125 to 10\u22123 mutations per base pair per generation, which is about a million times greater than the mutation rates in other genes [38]. Generally, single base substitution is preferable than insertions or deletions (indel) in SHM. Also, SHM has been reported to favour certain motifs such as WRCY (W = A or T, R = A or G, C, Y = T or C), and its reverse complement RGYW motifs [24, 39]. Therefore, SHM is active in CDR regions where these motifs are largely presented [40, 41]. About two third of SHM induced substitution mutations are transition mutations as they are more preferred in SHM [42]. Antibodies that have undergone SHM will produce higher affinity antigen receptors to compete with lower affinity or inactive antibodies. This selection process enables higher affinity antibodies against target specific antibodies to be concentrated [3].",

CSR switches antibody isotypes via DNA deletion and recombination on the IgH constant region upon exposure to an antigen. Therefore, CSR is vital in antibody maturation against infections and vaccines. Defective CSR has been associated with a range of diseases [43\u201345]. CSR occurs between switch (S) sequences that are located upstream of each constant region genes (CH) exon except for C\u03b4 exons [46, 47]. Different immunoglobulin isotypes are encoded by different CH exons which are arranged in the order of C\u03bc, C\u03b4, C\u03b3, C\u03b5 and C\u03b1 in heavy chains [48]. Thereby, replacement of CH exons with C\u03b3, C\u03b5 and C\u03b1 could give rises to IgG, IgA or IgE respectively. However, the V regions of antibodies will remain intact and unchanged [32, 49]. IgD is the only immunoglobulin isotype of the five that is generated via alternative splicing of the primary transcripts that encode IgM but not via CSR [48].",

The use of antisera highlighted the potential of antibodies although in a polyclonal level as a magic bullet to target infections for treatment. It was not until the introduction of hybridoma technology that production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was realised. Hybridoma technology requires the fusion of immortal myeloma cells with antibody producing spleen cells to generate a hybridoma exhibiting characteristics of both myeloma and spleen cells. This characteristic allows for the infinite generation of mAbs in vitro [51]. However, the approach requires the use of murine derived spleen cells post-immunization which have been reported to trigger human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response upon administration. This greatly limits the therapeutic applications of murine mAbs in humans which may result in reduced efficacy over time and in some cases anaphylaxis [52]. The complications associated with the use of animal derived mAbs resulted in a string of technological advancements like CDR grafting and antibody humanization to reduce the \u201cmurine-nature\u201d of the antibodies generated. Ultimately, the ability to generate fully human antibodies was perceived as the solution for this issue.",

The application of in vitro display technologies like phage display has allowed the generation of fully human mAbs in greater amounts and in a more controlled manner [53, 59\u201361]. However, phage display is no longer the only display method available for the production of human mAbs. Examples of other in vitro display technologies that can be used for mAb generation are ribosomal display [54], yeast surface display [55, 56], bacterial surface display [57, 58] and mRNA display [62, 63]. The introduction of the xenograph mice technology for human antibody generation also assisted in the generation of monoclonal antibodies with the prospect of affinity maturation [64]. Phage display is a promising in vitro display method that has been utilised successfully to isolate target specific antibodies by exploiting the Ff phages or filamentous phages [65]. The important advantages of phage display that makes it a preferred alternative is the robustness, simplicity, and stability of phage particles which allows the selection of desired antibodies against different targets under predefined conditions [66].",

Due to the non-lytic characteristic of filamentous phages (f1, fd, M13), they are commonly used in phage display to infect gram negative bacteria carrying the F pilus [69]. The fundamental concept of phage display lies in the direct physical linkage between genotype and phenotype [70]. The proteins or peptides encoded by the genotype are usually displayed on the phage surface by fusion with the phage coat proteins pVIII (p8) and pIII (p3) [71, 72] even though fusion to coat protein pVII [73, 74] and pIX [74, 75] have also been reported. The N-terminal of p3 was found to be vital for phage infectivity [76]. Hence, the protein of interest fused to p3 affects the efficiency of phage infectivity and propagation [77]. Phage display takes advantage of the natural process of phage infection and propagation by replicating the process with the aid of a helper phage system when using a phagemid vector. The helper phage is used in combination with the phagemid system to provide the necessary coat proteins as well as wild-type p3 for phage packaging as shown in Fig. 3.1. The phagemid vector is unique in that it is designed to contain the features from both a bacterial expression plasmid as well as a phage replication plasmid. The phagemid is normally designed to harbour the antibody gene as a fusion to gIII. Therefore the helper phage will function as the source of the remaining wild-type proteins required for phage replication, morphogenesis and assembly [78].\n",

The physical isolation and enrichment of target specific mAbs from the diverse library is performed via biopanning. Biopanning is a term coined to describe the sieving process of positive clones from the diverse library and subsequent augmentation of the positive population. The biopanning process involves several repetitive cycles of binding, washing, and amplification of the positive phage clones until a predominant population is present [70]. The process involves the immobilization of the target antigen on various solid surfaces such as polystyrene plates, microbeads [80], nitrocellulose blots [81], column matrix [81] or immunoassay tips [59]. The antibody phage library is then introduced to the bound target antigen and left to incubate to allow affinity based capture of the antibody bearing phage particles to the antigens. The unbound antibody-phage particles are then removed by washing. The remaining bound phage particles are then eluted using acid-based elution or enzyme based digestion. The eluted phage particles are then amplified by re-infection with E. coli for a fresh cycle of phage packaging. The new population of phage particles are then ready to be used for the ensuing round of biopanning. This cycle is repeated a few rounds to ensure a continuous enrichment of the targeted population of phage particles. Varying the wash and elution conditions can customize the characteristics of the isolated mAbs. This is to simulate different environments and stringencies to isolate mAbs featuring a particular characteristic.",

            "text": "The major limitation associated with the E. coli folding machinery is its ability to provide better display efficiencies of smaller versions of the antibody fragments instead of the full antibody format on phage surfaces [82]. However, the presentation of full length IgG using bacterial periplasmic display was previously demonstrated to yield antibodies with nanomolar range of binding affinities [83]. Even so, the use of smaller antibody fragments has a distinct advantage in terms of tissue penetration. Smaller antibody fragments are able to penetrate tissues with a higher efficacy without compromising their affinities and specificities. The diminutive size of antibody fragments that works in favour for bacterial expression host allows for an easier and faster expression of recombinant antibodies [84, 85]. Several common antibody formats displayed on phage includes the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) [86, 87] fragment antigen binding (Fab) [88, 89] and domain antibodies [85]. The scFv format is the preferred antibody format used for phage display as it is not prone to degradation and is easier to be expressed in its functional form by bacteria [90, 91]. The scFv format is made up of the variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domains interconnected with a glycine-serine (GS) linker [70]. The application of linkers has also provided new Fab molecules in the form of single chain Fab (scFab) fragments for phage display [88]. However, the choice of fragment to be used for library generation will be dependent on the downstream application of the antibodies. Possibilities to engineer new formats allow grafting of the variable domains from any format to be engineered to other subsequent formats. This freedom for format exchange allows for improved applications of antibodies for biomedical applications. Even so, the choice of format used will also have to take into account the ability to clone a large diverse collection of the clones to form a library for phage display selections. In addition to that, format conversions from scFv to full IgG have been reported to cause a loss of target affinity largely due to conformational changes in the structure post-conversion. Therefore, proper consideration and design is required before format exchange of antibody fragments is carried out [92].",

Antibody libraries are useful assets for antibody development programs as they can be applied for various targets for multiple applications. In general, antibody libraries are classified into four categories, namely the na\u00efve, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. The classification of the antibody libraries are mainly influenced by the source of antibody V genes for library generation [93]. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using V genes from non-immunized donors [93, 94]. Immune antibody libraries however are constructed utilizing antibody V genes from immunized donors or infected individuals [93]. Synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries are constructed using synthesized DNA oligonucleotides where the repertoire diversity is devoid of any natural immune maturation processes [95]. This chapter will focus on the principles and characteristics of na\u00efve libraries including the application of antibodies derived from na\u00efve libraries in combating infectious diseases.",

Na\u00efve libraries are supposedly able to be used for the isolation of mAbs against any antigen [96]. The process involved in the generation of na\u00efve antibody libraries is well established and has been described in numerous publications [97\u2013100]. The human natural antibody repertoire is approximately 1011 in size, which is a thousand times larger than the murine na\u00efve antibody repertoire [101]. However, antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries usually exhibit lower affinities compared to antibodies isolated from immunized libraries. This is because the na\u00efve repertoire would not have undergone in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies [96]. During antibody library generation, several critical aspects that are monitored includes library size and repertoire diversity in determining the quality of the library [102]. In the case of na\u00efve libraries, larger library sizes are preferred to ensure higher affinity mAbs are isolated. The correlation between larger library sizes with higher affinity mAbs has been reported in several instances as high affinity clones were successfully retrieved from larger size libraries compared to smaller size antibody libraries [93, 103, 104].",

Antibody genes could be sourced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), bone marrow, tonsil, and, spleen [105]. However, B cells at various stages have different degrees of mutation. B cells obtained from the bone marrow are the most na\u00efve while B cells from tonsils are the most mutated. The degree of mutation will have an adverse effect on the repertoire of the library. Therefore, the highly mutated V genes from tonsils is not an ideal choice for na\u00efve antibody library construction but suitable for immune libraries [106]. Na\u00efve B cells are better represented by the raw V(D)J recombination in the bone marrow which have yet to encounter any antigens. The diversity of a na\u00efve antibody library is largely dependent on the number of unique antibody sequences that is successfully cloned into the library [61]. B cells are usually taken from peripheral blood for the construction of human antibody libraries as the method for extraction is less invasive compared to bone marrow extraction [107]. Peripheral blood contains a high proportion of na\u00efve B cells, making peripheral blood a very good source for B cells [61]. The first na\u00efve antibody library reported was constructed using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of unimmunized donors with an estimated library size of greater than 107. The library was successfully used to isolate soluble antibody fragments against haptens with good affinities [108].",

This is due to the subjective nature of the term healthy, as it is unlikely that donors have never been infected throughout their lifetime making it realistically impossible to obtain \u201ctruly na\u00efve\u201d samples [94]. This is because healthy individuals would have recovered from a prior infection or have been immunized at some stage in their life. Vaccinations have been reported to increase antigen-specific repertoires which could result in a skewed repertoire being generated [109, 110]. In addition, memory cells in the immune system are capable of recognizing past infections which could contribute to changes in the antibody repertoire [94, 111]. The common considerations for na\u00efve library sample collection includes healthy donors without immunosuppressive treatments as well as antigen exposure history [112], age [113, 114], genotype and chromatin structure [115, 116].",

Naive antibody library construction starts with blood sample collection from a healthy population. B cells from whole blood can be isolated using the Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation by utilizing the density differences between mononuclear cells with other elements in the blood for separation [117]. Mononuclear cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets stay on top of the Ficoll layer because they are not dense enough to penetrate the Ficoll layer. Granulocytes on the other hand sediment to the bottom of the Ficoll layer due to increased density upon contact with the Ficoll medium. Red blood cells also sediment to the bottom of Ficoll solution due to aggregation by Ficoll. Mononuclear cell layer is washed and centrifuged to remove platelets that remain in the supernatant [117].\n",

Antibody specific primers such as IgM constant region specific primers allow the cDNA synthesis of antibody sequences from the IgM isotype. However, priming using random hexamers allows all the five antibody classes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM) to be amplified for a highly diverse repertoire . Therefore, random hexamers are being used more often to synthesize first strand cDNA from B cell mRNA for the generation of na\u00efve antibody libraries [105]. In most cases, the preferred isotype for na\u00efve antibody library generation is IgM. However, up to 40% of the circulating memory cells expresses IgM that may not be na\u00efve due to somatic hypermutation upon exposure to antigens [61].",

However, V gene primer designs have evolved over the years due to additional information available with improvements in sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis. An improved database of antibody V gene sequences from next generation sequencing has shed much light into antibody gene usage and V gene family coverage. The addition of new antibody gene sequences has allowed for new primer sets to be designed with improved gene coverage [67]. Improved gene coverage of the primer set has a great influence on the repertoire of the final antibody library generated. This helps to ensure all possible antibody genes are represented in the library as well as increasing the possible combinations of the HC and LC genes.",

Amplification bias during PCR is a common concern that could influence the final repertoire of the library. Antibody gene usage is not evenly distributed with variations resulting from previous infections with additional variations from individual immune responses. Therefore having a highly representative primer set is important to ensure that unique gene families or poorly presented templates are also amplified [61]. A second round of PCR amplification is performed to introduce the desired restriction sites for cloning into the phagemid vector. There are several different strategies to construct a na\u00efve antibody library. The most common approaches used for the construction of na\u00efve antibody libraries is either by two-step/three-step cloning [94, 120] or PCR assembly [108] as shown in Fig. 3.3 In two-step cloning, light chain genes are first amplified to introduce the glycine-serine linker before cloning into the phagemid vector to establish an intermediate library. Cloning of the amplified heavy chain genes to the intermediate library is done to form a full scFv format library. The orientation of which V gene to clone first is influenced by the higher diversity of the HC CDR3 regions [121]. In some cases, three-step cloning is used to construct na\u00efve antibody libraries . In this approach, independent VH and VL libraries are first cloned to function as intermediate libraries. Then the libraries are digested and ligated together to form the full antibody library containing both VH and VL repertoires [102]. In PCR assembly, the VH and VL genes are amplified to introduce the GS linker before cloning. Then, PCR assembly is used to assemble the three fragments to form the full scFv format. The assembled fragment is then digested with restriction enzymes before cloning it upstream of the gene III coat protein in the phagemid [97].\n",

The library diversity is normally calculated based on the number of colonies formed from serial dilutions of transformants that are plated out on 2xYT agar and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C [97, 128]. Library developers often target for the highest library size as possible. However, this is an uphill task due to the limitations mentioned earlier. Even so, the average size for na\u00efve antibody libraries is in the range of 109 or higher. The direct correlation between library size with antibody affinity has spurred the need to generate large library sizes in order to isolate high affinity antibodies without the need to further improve the affinities [61].",

This can be overcome by using na\u00efve antibody libraries coupled with antibody phage display technology to allow the isolation of antibodies against antigens which are toxic or detrimental to the host [79]. For instance, hemolysin E (HlyE) toxin produced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is a pore forming toxin which is antigenic to humans, may pose a challenge for conventional antibody generation techniques [136]. However, soluble scFv mAb against HlyE toxin was successfully isolated from a 2 \u00d7 109 na\u00efve human scFv library constructed from 90 healthy donors. The donors consisted of equal distribution of donors from three ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese, and Indian) and equal gender distribution. To enhance the diversity of the library, combinatorial mixing of VH and VL chains were performed where heavy and light chains were randomly mixed. The na\u00efve library was generated by two-step cloning by inserting the light chains followed by heavy chains [94]. The ability to harness the contrasting immune responses from different individuals resulting in varying gene rearrangements, gene pairings and usage allows for the improved diversity of the na\u00efve library. This improved diversity ensures higher repertoire for antibody generation with improved affinities. The large library size also has a significant role in determining the antibody quality isolated from the library.",

            "text": "Another primary example of the application of na\u00efve libraries is the ability to generate antibodies against the spores of Bacillus anthracis which can result in death post inhalation. The spores of B. anthracis is a potent biological threat which was abused as a bioweapon in 2001 when anthrax spores were intentionally mailed to Washington, DC [137, 138]. The toxic nature of the spores makes immunization for antibody generation impossible as it would most likely kill the host. Therefore, isolation of human antibodies capable of binding to live native spores is possible using a na\u00efve scFv library. Biopanning of a na\u00efve scFv library isolated two clones with differences in specificity and affinity to the spores of the Bacillus strains as well as recognizing different epitopes. Analysis of both clones revealed a bias in VH-VL pairing in the repertoire after exposure of the spores to the human immune system. A na\u00efve Fab library was later constructed by combining VH and VL genes from the isolated positive scFv clones with the aim to reduce the cross reactivity with other Bascillus strains. Chain shuffling technique was introduced to the Fab library to increase the diversity of VH and VL genes. Clones isolated from Fab library showed much lower cross reactivity with spores from other strains [139]. The process was envisioned from the panning of the human na\u00efve scFv library against the spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 [139].",

            "text": "Dengue virus of the Flaviviridae family has a single stranded positive strand RNA as the genome. Post translational modification of the polypeptide give rise to three structural proteins (capsid, membrane, envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [149, 150]. Non-structural 3 (NS3) protein and non-structural 5 (NS5) proteins are essential in viral replication which are subdivided into few distinct functional domains. Targeting these domains provides important information about dengue replication and for the development of inhibitors against dengue virus [151, 152]. Na\u00efve human Fab library HX02 (Humanyx Pte Ltd., Singapore) was used to screen for NS3 binders. NS3 proteins were biotinylated to bind to streptavidin magnetic beads prior to panning. Concentration of immobilised NS3 proteins was reduced for each round with an increase in the washing steps during panning. Ten unique clones were obtained and observed to bind to the protease domain, helicase domain, or both the domains for different dengue serotypes. One clone 3F8 demonstrate the ability to bind with NS3 proteins from all dengue serotypes (DENV1-4) and has a high binding affinity (15 nM) in ELISA as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with KD 0.5 nM [151]. Similar panning strategy was applied to isolate antibodies against the NS5 proteins. However, the six unique clones isolated were specific only to dengue virus serotype 3. Hence, panning was performed with alternate dengue serotypes to enrich clones which were able to recognise NS5 proteins for all serotypes. Two cross-reactive Fabs (5M1 and 5R3) and one DENV3 specific Fab (5M3) were obtained. The clones were incubated with an array of overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the domain regions to map the epitope binding sites [152]. The ability to isolate cross-reactive clones against several serotypes as well as serotype specific antigens shows the flexibility afforded when using na\u00efve antibody libraries\n.",

Approaches such as increased library sizes [96, 100], enhanced cloning strategies [153], and improve panning protocols [154] have been demonstrated to retrieve good binders. Another approach reported the use of protease sensitive helper phage KM13. This method allows high throughput screening of naive library for a wide range of antigens [155, 156]. The protease-cleavage sequence was inserted between domain 2 and domain 3 of pIII to eliminate background contributed by helper phage. With this KM13 helper phage, one or two rounds of selection would be needed since the number of selection did not increase the chance to obtain new binders. Na\u00efve scFv against rabies virus was successfully isolated from a human na\u00efve scFv library with the size of 1.5 \u00d7 108 individual clones. Rabies virus is considered a difficult target due to the presence of limited amount of target in the mixture which might contribute to the enrichment of background or non-specific binders [156].",

Isolated scFv and Fab antibody fragments against native spores of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3336 were labelled with two different fluorescent dyes (FITC or rhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimide) for direct and indirect detection by fluorescence microscope . The detection signal was greatly amplified when fluorescent dye was labelled to the high-copy number of phage coat protein pVIII of the antibody phage particles. Direct detection of individual spores was made possible by fluorescent-labelled antibody-phage clones [139]. These spore binding antibodies could be further incorporated into other detection systems such as high-flow-rate fluidized bed as solid phase capture [169], electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) [170], and magnetic particle fluorogenic immunoassay (MPFIA) [170]. Another example was demonstrated by L. acidophilus species specific scFv isolated with phage display technology. The resulting scFvs isolated was applied in FACS for enrichment of L. acidophilus which resulted in more than 99.8% genome coverage. It was envisioned that this species specific antibodies could be applied to enrich low abundance organism in a community which could lead to better taxonomic identification and genome recovery prior to genome sequencing [143].",

Antibodies can play a crucial role in neutralizing the infectivity of a virus by blocking binding sites or receptors on the virus or host cells. These class of antibodies are known as neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Neutralization is defined as the reduction in viral infectivity via the binding of antibodies to viral surface particles which leads to the blocking of viral replication processes [172, 173]. Viral infection requires the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane but different viruses may utilize different approaches for infection. Naked viruses (adenoviruses and papillomaviruses) are able to penetrate the host cell membrane to enter the cytoplasm or inject their genome through the membrane [174]. While enveloped viruses (dengue viruses, zika viruses, ebola viruses) have to fuse their envelopes with hosts\u2019 membranes for attachment [175\u2013177]. Therefore, antibodies binding to influenza virus membrane protein is able to impede the fusion of influenza viruses with host\u2019s cell membrane [178].",

For example, dengue envelope (E) protein is a common target for neutralizing antibodies and also vaccine development since it contains few neutralising epitopes and binding motifs for virus entry into host cells [180]. A human Fab mAb 5J7 was shown to bind to all four dengue serotypes in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but could only neutralize dengue serotype 3. This mAb is able to neutralise 50% of dengue virus at nanogram level. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed one Fab is able to bind across three E proteins and engage only domains that are crucial for infection. Moreover, the 5J7 antibody could prevent the virus from entering the host cells after attachment. The pre-attachment neutralization test showed 100% efficiency with 10 ng \u03bcL \u22121 of antibodies [181].",

            "text": "In some cases, polyclonal antibodies work better in detection of viral proteins such as dengue NS2B protein. NS2B protein works as a cofactor for NS3 protease activity [182]. NS2B protein is small in size making it difficult to target when the whole virus particle is used. Polyclonal antibodies against NS2B proteins were generated via gene or protein immunisation in mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays confirmed the polyclonal antibodies generated are able to recognise both the native and denatured form of NS2B protein [183]. In certain cases such as ebola virus (EBOV) infections, an antibody cocktail is used as NAbs. Administration of antibody cocktails instead of single antibodies has shown promising results on non-human primates. Several antibody cocktails against EBOV were developed in recent years, which includes ZMAb [184], MB-003 [185], ZMapp [186] and the combination of mAB114 with mAb100 [187] that demonstrates successful therapeutic activity. ZMapp, the improved version of two antibody cocktails (MB-003 and ZMAb) reported 100% survival rate when administered to rhesus macaques despite the treatment being initiated only after 5 days of infection [186]. The antibodies in the cocktail are found to target several vulnerable sites on the glycoprotein (GP). Neutralizing antibodies target the base of GP while the non-neutralizing antibodies will bind to the glycan cap and mucin-like domains which functions as an external domain for the viral attachment and fusion [188\u2013192]. This allows for a cumulative effect on the neutralization of virus replication and prevents virus survival. The latest antibody cocktail of mAb114 and mAb100 was successful in protecting nonhuman primates against the Ebola virus disease which includes viremia. The combination of both antibodies function to target different regions of the Ebola virus to improve its efficacy. The antibody mAb100 was found to recognize the base of the Ebola virus GP trimer which prevents access to the cathepsin-cleavage loop and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of the GP that is required for virus entry. However, mAb114 was able to interact with the glycan cap and inner chalice of the GP. The antibody remains associated to the glycan cap even after proteolytic removal. This aids to inhibit the binding of the cleaved GP to its receptor. The combination effect of the two antibodies provides the basis of virus neutralization and protection against the Ebola virus [187].",

As an example, Rituximab (Rituxan\u00ae) targeted against the pan-B-cell marker CD20 induces cell death [200]. In this regard, several other pathogens such as varicella, tetanus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), rabies and Hepatitis B has been reported to show successful prophylactic use of antibodies in exposed individuals [43, 135]. In cases of immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals especially in HIV infected patients, antibody therapy can be a viable option for therapy because it can provide immunity to other infectious pathogens without giving rise to any further T-cell stimulation which promotes HIV growth. In addition, antibodies can be given to infections where no vaccines are available, for example, Ebola or Marburg viruses.",

This conjugates are widely applied in cancer therapies due to their capability to differentiate healthy and disease state tissues [201]. In 2015, a novel antibody-antibiotic conjugate was developed to eliminate intracellular S. aureus, one of the major causes of bacterial infection in the world. The anti-S. aureus antibodies were screened and carefully selected from peripheral blood of patients recovering from various S. aureus infections and linked to highly efficacious antibiotics via capthesin-cleavable linker. The conjugate eliminates S. aureus via two mechanisms : (1) engulf by host cells and let intracellular proteases cleave and release the antibiotic in active form; (2) binding of conjugate to bacterium and deliver antibiotic within phagosome to kill the bacterial. This conjugate was able to kill S. aureus inside human macrophages, endothelial and epithelial cell lines [202]. Na\u00efve antibody-drug conjugate would be a new avenue for therapy, not only in infectious diseases but also other diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases. Conjugating drug or other potent molecules with na\u00efve antibodies might be a promising way to overcome the limitations possess by intact na\u00efve antibodies and conventional antibiotic treatments.

Hence, a good quality na\u00efve antibody library\nwith a satisfactory size and diversity becomes an impeccable tool to generate antibodies against infectious diseases. Despite the antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries might not have satisfactory binding affinities, the advancement of molecular technology could be utilised to overcome these limitations. We believe, with the aid of newer technologies, better quality human na\u00efve libraries could be constructed for the isolation of better quality antibodies to combat the infectious diseases. Na\u00efve antibody phage libraries will have a foreseeable role to play in the journey to overcome the challenges posed by infectious agents.",

Total RNA is then prepared and used as template for reverse transcription into first strand cDNA by using gene specific primers. The cDNA is then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate DNA amplicons. Second round of PCR is performed on these DNA samples to introduce cut sites for restriction enzymes. The amplicons are then cloned into a phagemid and transformed into suitable bacteria cells",
