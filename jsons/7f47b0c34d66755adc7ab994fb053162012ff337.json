The discovery of opium's ability to relieve pain stimulated the refinement of opium and generation of synthetic analogues to create more effective, potent, and faster acting analgesics. The social and economic value of opioid analgesics has remained high not only due to their demonstrated efficiency in mitigating pain but also their noteworthy ability to reliably produce pleasant rewarding psychological side effects. Consequently, at various times during the past several hundred years, opioid drugs have sparked wars, fueled black markets, driven up violence and cartel crime, and triggered numerous opioid addiction and overdose death epidemics around the world.",

The additional seductive pharmacological nature of these potent compounds, and the ability to administer doses directly into the bloodstream via hypodermic needles, producing intense euphoria, sedation, and hypnosis (sleep), can lead to some developing compulsive use and addiction. As societies have grappled with rising rates of use and addiction, some have reflexively reached for supplycentric policies to reduce access. While supply reduction is a major piece of the puzzle, without addressing the demand side of the equation, these approaches can have the inadvertent effect of shifting people who were using prescription opioids to the often cheaper, more readily available, but more lethal, options of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl.",

To begin, below we describe briefly the nature, structure, origin, and growth in the use of opioid analgesics and subsequently describe the etiology and epidemiology of the current crisis using broad public health and health belief models as frameworks to help guide understanding. In the second section, we describe the approaches that have been applied to address both supply (e.g., overprescribing) and demand (e.g., overdose intervention, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments) sides of the equation. In the final section, we review the lessons learned in an attempt to outline strategies to prevent future epidemics.",

The opium poppy, from which the morphine molecule comes, is a naturally occurring flowering plant found in many parts of the world and cultivated explicitly in China and parts of the Middle East for its pain killing and euphoria-inducing properties for both licit and illicit markets. Opium is the dried aqueous gum that can be leached from the opium poppy, about 12% of which is the alkaloid analgesic, morphine. Morphine can be extracted, and a more potent formulation can be derived (diacetylmorphine or heroin), which is used as a strong analgesic to address severe pain as well as used recreationally to induce rapid and intense euphoria.",

The degree of use of pharmaceuticals, like many other commodities, is socially, economically, politically, and culturally based. The United States is among the largest global consumers of opioids, with prescribing rates that outpace many peer nations; however, while consumption of opioids in the United States is undoubtedly high, it has been overstated. For example, while it is commonly reported that the United States consumes \"80% of the world's supply of opioids,\" it is because within that figure are certain opioid medications that are exclusively marketed in the United States while other countries use similar, but slightly different, opioid compounds. Consequently, a more accurate estimate is that while the United States has approximately 4.4% of the world's population, it consumes about 30% of the world's global supply of opioids [2] . Still, as shown in Fig. 1 .1, using standard daily doses per million inhabitants, relative to other middle-and high-income countries, opioid use is disproportionately high but not as high as is commonly stated. Perhaps the interplay of a strong biotech industry, capitalist consumer-oriented free market economy, and constitutionally based cultural expectations that explicitly endorse the right to \"the pursuit of happiness\" has promoted America's demand for rapid pharmaceutical remedies for pain and suffering. Within such an economic and sociocultural context, however, like many industrialized countries, the United States has sought to institute safeguards to curb the potential appetite for \"too much of a good thing.\" For example, it possesses among the strongest protections and regulations worldwide regarding quality and safety of medications, and administrative oversight regarding scheduling, prescribing, and marketing (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]; Prescription Monitoring Programs [PMPs]). As explained below, a number of forces converged to create the current overdose epidemic and opioid addiction crisis seen that has emerged since the late 1990s.",

            "text": "It can be helpful to draw upon well-developed conceptual frameworks for helping to understand, and thus intervene upon, different disease epidemics that occur from time to time. The public health model of disease suggests there are three major factors that interact to influence the spread of an epidemic: the agent (e.g., the presence of an environmental toxin; in this case, opioids), the host (i.e., the human beings exposed to the opioid), and the environment (e.g., the variables that can influence the degree to which the host is exposed to the opioid; see Fig. 1 .1). To the extent that an agent (e.g., opioid) can cause harm to a host (person), the environment can play a crucial role in mitigating or exacerbating that harm. In the case of addiction or substance use disorder, more generally, this public health model of disease is complicated slightly further, because-as is the case with opioids-the agent is highly desired by the host since it can kill pain as well as produce intense pleasure. All other things being equal, if it becomes widely available, easily accessible, affordable, legal, and medically prescribed-and thus has lower stigma attached to it-its use will increase. Given that opioids are known to cause [2] addiction and increase risk for overdose death and are heavily regulated for safety and quality, how could these potent and seductive medications become so widely available and easily accessible? It seems likely that two major factors influenced this high degree of prescription use of opioids and population exposure. One was the perception that these medications are very safe and hardly ever led to addiction among pain patients. Strikingly, based upon a single, one-paragraph publication in 1980 [3] -albeit one that was published in perhaps the most highly influential medical journal of all (the New England Journal of Medicine)-that was heavily promoted and cited, it was widely believed that addiction was almost nonexistent among medical patients treated in hospital settings with opioid analgesics such as hydrocodone and hydromorphone. Given the journal's medical prestige, this publication and its common citation were rarely questioned and became widely referred to with little scrutiny. The pharmaceutical industry was only too happy to take advantage of what appeared to be a scientific medical blessing on the liberal use of their opioid analgesics from which they stood to profit.",

If people believe that the threat is low or practically nonexistent, or not severe, then they are unlikely to engage in such a preventive action.

Unrelieved pain was considered to be a major, yet completely avoidable, public health problem. In 1997, a collaborative project was initiated to integrate pain assessment and management into clinical best practice standards. Furthermore, in 2001, all patient care organizations accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) were required to document proper management of pain, and pain became the \"fifth vital sign\"-as integral to standard basic medical \"best practice\" assessment as obtaining a patient's body temperature or blood pressure reading.

Price too was relatively low in the early years of the epidemic, because for the most part prescribed opioids were covered by insurance, or otherwise cheap. This fact tended also to bias in favor of White American consumers who more likely had health insurance, who were potentially more likely to be prescribed due to unconscious racial bias among physicians, and who, in contrast to prior opioid epidemics, became overrepresented among those overdosing on opioids. Compared to prior mostly male, urban-based, heroin epidemics of the 1960s where the average age of onset was around 16 years old, individuals misusing opioids between 2000 and 2014 were older (mean age, 22.9 years) men and women living in less urban areas who were introduced to opioids through prescription drugs (75.0%). Also, Whites and non-Whites were equally represented in those initiating use prior to the 1980s, but nearly 90% of those who began use between 2000 and 2014 were White [6] . In more recent years, however, Blacks and Hispanic and Latino Americans have shown steady increases in overdose deaths, and overdose deaths among Black Americans in particular have risen more sharply since 2014 accounted for largely by an increase in overdoses among older Black men ( in those meeting criteria for an opioid use disorder, and in overdose deaths. Strikingly, overdose is now the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50 in the United States [7] . From 1999 to 2016, for example, more than 630,000 people have died from a drug overdose and it estimated that approximately twothirds of these involved opioids specifically.",

There have also been large-scale efforts to protect the host from fatal overdose through education and prevention efforts, as well as emergency intervention efforts (e.g., with widespread distribution of intranasal naloxone [Narcan]) and increased access to medications, psychosocial interventions, and harm reduction strategies (safe injection facilities and syringe service programs). From a policy standpoint, the latter are collectively known as \"demand reduction\" efforts in the supply and demand equation as they are designed to reduce the appeal of, and desire for, opioids through treating opioid use disorders.",

States and insurers have begun passing legislation and implementing policies aimed at curtailing access to prescription opioids. While responsible and cautious prescribing of opioids is critically important to reduce unnecessary exposure and access for opioid-na\u00efve individuals to reduce the incidence of opioid use and use disorder, supply-focused strategies are unlikely to benefit people who are already using opioids, including those with opioid use disorder or chronic pain. Prescribing guidelines, such as the 2016 CDC guidelines [10] , offered approaches for more judicious use of opioids limiting exposure to opioids in acute pain, continuously addressing the risk and benefit of opioid treatment, and screening and offering treatment for opioid use disorder. At the same time, these guidelines recognized the complexity of managing individuals who were started on high doses of opioids previously and the importance of safeguarding against patient abandonment in these scenarios in the case of opioid use disorder ( Fig. 1.6 ).",

Dramatic reductions in access to prescription opioids also risk pushing people with opioid use disorder toward the use of heroin or other illicit opioids obtained \"on the street.\" The 2017 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine acknowledged this potential negative impact of supply-focused policies through \"squeezing the balloon\" where efforts to reduce the misuse of prescription opioids may actually increase other use of potentially even more dangerous opioids, such as heroin [11] .

Adding specialized addiction counseling (e.g., CBT for addiction) to agonist medication, therapies that already come with brief 20-45-minute prescriber counseling and checkup-a manualized intervention known as \"medical management\" (MM)-have not been shown to enhance outcomes among OUD patients [18] . The failure to show additional benefit for specific addiction counseling on top of MM and medications (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone) may be because MM is likely to mobilize the same kinds of therapeutic mechanisms (e.g., recovery motivation, active coping, increased recovery self-efficacy) that are mobilized by all active interventions [19, 20] and, thus, adding an additional specific intervention does not confer additional benefit. Similar kinds of null effects have been found in other studies where psychosocial interventions are increased in intensity (e.g., from 5 hours of therapeutic contact to 20 hours) but do not confer increased therapeutic benefit [21] . There is some preliminary evidence for potential therapeutic synergy from extended community-based interventions, such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) participation in addition to buprenorphine or methadone [22] . At least one large observational study found that opioid use disorder patients on buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone), who engaged more in NA, had significantly better retention on the medication and higher abstinence rates [23] .

In Burlington, VT, a partnership between the police department, the mayor's office, the hospital, and the state attorney has sought to increase access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder including not prosecuting people for buprenorphine diversion. This type of approach from a police department and state attorney represents a massive philosophical shift and a recognition by law enforcement that lower threshold access to care, rather than punishment, is the key to addressing the ongoing crisis. These types of approaches to be spontaneously initiated by law enforcement reflect a recognition and increased appreciation of potentially ineffective, traditional, law enforcement approaches to addressing opioid use disorder.",

These are designed to reduce overdose deaths as well as lower the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C. Quantitative reviews including meta-analyses support the implementation of such approaches [34, 35] . In the United States these have taken the form of syringe service programs, overdose education and naloxone (\"Narcan\") distribution programs, and lower threshold treatment models. Other countries have expanded harm reduction even further to offer supervised injection facilities and supervised prescription heroin and injection programs (e.g., in the United Kingdom; [31] ). While cities in the United States have begun exploring the possibility of opening supervised injection facilities, strong opposition from the federal government remains. Evidence mostly from studies conducted in two cities, Vancouver, Canada, and Sydney, Australia, supports the public health utility of safe injection facilities [36] , but findings are somewhat mixed in high-quality studies in this domain. That said, there is no evidence that these facilities increase rates of drug use in any capacity. More research, however, is needed to understand the clinical and public health benefits related to these facilities and who in particular is likely to benefit from them.",

There has been an often-cited gap between practice and science for addiction treatment services, whereby practitioners either are not knowledgeable about or otherwise fail to implement science-based \"best practices.\" In this instance, however, it was a slightly different take on this criticism. Providers believed or were led to believe that these potent medications were in fact safe from a scientific standpoint. So, it was not the traditional \"research-practice gap\" that was to blame, but rather the misbelief, misinterpretation, and/or misapplication of the science. It is easy to see this in retrospect, but no one predicted it. The blithe acceptance and unquestioning citation by the medical community of a completely inadequate single publication regarding justification for safety were seized upon by the pharmaceutical industry. With seeming scientific assurance, the industry was able to deploy their significant public relations machinery to exert considerable weight and influence and subsequently increase prescribing of potent opioid medications to address pain. This effort was potentiated by a humane medical infrastructure push to address the debilitating human misery caused by acute and chronic pain. For a few years, while the focus lay on ensuring practitioners were assessing \"the fifth vital sign,\" and prescribing accordingly, the waves on the surface appeared to be no cause for alarm. Yet, an invisible undertow was present and gathering momentum. This undercurrent would ultimately begin to sweep hundreds of thousands out to sea to drown beyond their depth, with even bigger waves of heroin and fentanyl to follow.",

The stigma and discrimination that pervades addiction meant a lethargic response to a rapidly growing public health crisis which, for almost any other health threat that might kill only a fraction of the number killed by the opioid overdose crisis, would have been met with greater alarm and more immediate and adequate appropriation from state and federal entities. A national response like those seen internationally to stem the threat from Ebola (Ebola virus disease [EVD]) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) would have curtailed this crisis. Instead, while the alarm bell was ringing there was a cultural and political deafness underwritten by prejudice against those suffering from addiction. This allowed an emerging crisis to grow and spread, change shape, and increase its toll until not a day passed without mention of the \"opioid overdose crisis\" on media channels of every political orientation and flavor. Only when it was realized that the overdose crisis kills equally across party lines, and the tears from dozens of bereaved mothers had moistened the benches of congress, did government begin to come together to act; but it was too little, too late, for hundreds of thousands of families. The pervasive impact of racism in our society's response to addiction crises and people who use drugs cannot be overemphasized. In past drug epidemics when the communities most deeply affected were black and Hispanic/Latino, the overwhelming response was a tough-on-crime approach that resulted in mass incarceration. The notion that the current crisis is in fact a public health issue was strongly influenced by the narrative of the innocent white victim, deserving of compassion rather than punishment. Addressing these pervasive stigmatizing attitudes through increasing education about the nature of opioid and other substance use disorders, shifting our language and terminology so that it more accurately reflects the neurological and medical nature of these conditions [38, 39] , and increasing the personal testimony from the millions already in recovery [40] who are willing to speak out and demonstrate that recovering \"addicts\" are like everyone else, are ways likely to help reduce the prejudice, stigma, and discrimination that has retarded and undermined an adequate, rapid, response to the current crisis.",
