Problems to overcome are numerous, covering both patient care, professional protection and urgency of management; we only discuss here three of them: 1. The isolation of COVID or non-COVID patients by restructuring the circulation areas, using the advantages of an operating theatre (clean and contaminated circuit, closed operating theatre under negative pressure) and identifying two separates care team selected both on professional skills and risk of viral exposition (age over 60 years old and/or comorbidities). All successive decisions were validated with hospital hygiene team; 2. Making the best of existing structures for patient care and professional protection: the RR allows easy centralised monitoring of patients but exposes to aerosolised virus, especially with high oxygen flow and requires enhanced protection for nursing professionals (FFP2 mask changed every 8 hours, dressing and take-off procedures, gown) but also an adaptation of the RR 1,2 . Negative pressure was installed on day 2 after admission of first critical patients and RR was equipped with 3 air extractors Plasmair\u00a9 (Dalkia) which allow treating 7.500 m 3 of air per hour (i.e. 10 volumes per hour for a 750 m 3 RR) 3 ; 3. The medical and paramedical anaesthesia teams had to upgrade rapidly their skills to be able to use high and very high oxygen flow therapy, ventilation of the patient with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome and to be kept informed of additional therapeutic solutions specific to these patients in collaboration with intensivists. The target physician/patient ratio was set to 1/5 (2 anaesthesiologist 24 hours a day) and 1/2 for nurses in the acute phase and 1/2.5 in the steady phase.",
