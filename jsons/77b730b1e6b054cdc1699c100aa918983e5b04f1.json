The first plague pandemic (Justinian plague) in 6 th --7 th centuries is lost to memories but secular track of the Black Death in fourteenth century Europe is well known. The epidemic began in central and eastern Asia in 1340's, travelled along the caravan--routes with businessmen and initially infected upper SES people in central and southern Europe, western Asia and northern Africa before spreading in the poor colonies of the major cities along the trade routes. When sea--faring started in earnest and ships became the conduits of business, plague travelled along these ships from eastern, southern and western Asian ports among business people and administrators and quickly spread to the poor working in ships and their families in coastal cities before moving inland among the low SES. Similar track was mapped for cholera, which was carried from southern and eastern Asian ports among businessmen and seamen to North Africa, Europe and North America and rapidly spread among the poor men, women and children in port cities and elsewhere. Yellow fever also spread from shipmen and slaves from Africa to business people in Europe and the Americas and then to the poor. 4 Influenza--A epidemic spread from South Africa and Europe along with veterans of the 1 st World War and spread rapidly among general population of Europe, Asia and northern Africa and finally landed in Asia where it killed more poor people than the rich in India. 5 The current covid--19 epidemic began from Wuhan, an industrial city in south--eastern China, 6, 7 and rapidly spread via business--men to populations in Europe, West Asia and North America. 8 The infection initially was among the high SES people living in upper and mid SES in major cities (Amsterdam, Lombardia, .

Covid--19 clinical registries from China and Europe have reported a specific phenotype that is more prone to mortality from this infection--older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, concomitant cardiovascular disease and heart failure--especially in the low SES individuals. 20 Ethnic minorities are especially susceptible. 21 Wadhera et al studied population characteristics across the 5 New York boroughs to evaluate differences in covid--19 related outcomes. 15 It was observed that number of patients with covid--19 who were hospitalized per 100 000 population was highest in the Bronx (634) and lowest in Manhattan (331). The number of deaths related to covid--19 per 100 000 population was also highest in the Bronx (224) and lowest in Manhattan (122). Borough of the Bronx had the highest proportion of ethnic minorities, the most persons living in poverty and the lowest levels of educational attainment as compared to other boroughs of New York. 15 The UK Office of National Statistics has reported that covid--19 death rates are almost double in most vs. least deprived areas. 22 The age--standardized mortality rate involving covid--19 in the most deprived areas was 55.1/100,100 compared to 25.3/100,000 in the least deprived areas. London had the highest death rate with high rates in low SES locations of Newham, Brent and Hackney. It has been argued that these minorities are the missing victims of covid--19 infection. 23 In the present study we have not evaluated state--level social and healthcare characteristics. However, in a previous study it has been reported that state-level HDI correlated strongly with state--level social development index (a composite of 20 social and economic variables). 24 Indian data also show that more than two--thirds of the patients are concentrated in 13 Indian cities and more than half in the 6 cities mentioned above. 25 A major study limitation is lack of availability of data from rural India and large central and eastern Indian states. 16 .

More studies regarding socioeconomic macro--and micro--level determinants of covid--19 infection are required from India and other low and lower--middle income countries as it has been predicted that covid--19 epidemic shall ultimately reside among the lower socioeconomic stratum in these countries. 23 A number of studies have predicted the burden of covid--19 infection in India using various modeling techniques, e.g. Bhardwaj, Ghosh et al. 26, 27 These studies focus on extent of the disease and date/s of epidemic ascent and descent. However, modeling techniques of a novel epidemic are not always accurate. 28 These techniques have been criticized for being insensitive to data quality, intervention strategies and strength of research enterprise. 29 All these high--quality inputs are missing from most of the forecasting equations and are limitation of the present study also. We have focused on sociological aspects of the disease and show that the epidemic is still in evolution and till the time it matures into low HDI states, it is unlikely to terminate soon ( Figure 3 ). However, although we have used raw data available from a non--profit website, 16 there are certain differences with the official government data used by others, 26, 27 and the prediction may not be accurate.",

Slums are least prepared for the pandemic of covid--19 as most basic needs such as regular water supply, toilets, waste collection and adequate and secure housing are almost non--existent. 30 Interventions that have been found useful in China and European countries may be impractical. 31 Space constraints and overcrowding make physical distancing and self--quarantine impractical in most low SES locations globally and also in India. Corburn et al suggest policies for covid--19 control in urban informal settlements. 30 These include science--based policies for arresting course of the disease, improving general medical care, provision of economic, social and physical improvements, and focus on urban poor including migrants and slum--communities. Microlevel strategies include institution of informal emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement, moratorium on evictions, guaranteed payments to the poor, deploying trained community health workers, food assistance, waste management plan and plan for mobility and healthcare. 30 Focus on using social and behavioral science techniques is essential to harness of benefits of such interventions. 32 Long term planning is crucial because the course of the epidemic cannot be predicted yet.",

Most states in the upper HDI tertile show flattening of the curve, especially Kerala and Himachal. In the mid tertile there is increase in a few states (Maharashtra, Gujarat) while others have reported a gradual ascent. In low tertile group of states there is an ncrease in most states with greatest increase in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Time trends in cumulative number of deaths in each state in shown in Figure 2. Similar to number of cases, there are large differences in logarithmic trajectory of increase in covid--19 related deaths in different Indian states. Slow increase with flattening of curve is observed in most upper HDI states especially Kerala, Tamilnadu and Himachal. In mid--HDI tertile states, large and rapid increase is observed in Maharashtra, Gujarat and West Bengal while in lower HDI tertile states almost all states demonstrate a rapid increase with high rates in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. We correlated total covid--19 cases and associated deaths at weekly intervals with HDI of different states to determine their association with development of each state using Pearson's correlation (Figure 3). In the first two weeks of study there was a strong positive correlation of HDI with covid--19 cases (r= 0.37, 0.40) as well as deaths (r= 0.31, 0.42). This indicates that the disease was more common in better--developed states in March 2020. However, there is a gradual reduction in strength of association and towards early May 2020 a neutral or negative correlation is observed both for cases (r= 0.04, 0.06) as well as deaths (r= --0.005, 0.001) indicating the disease is trending towards lower developed states (Figure 3). A significant negative logarithmic trend is observed both for cases (y= --377.9ln(x)+4040.2, R 2 = 0.92) as well as deaths (y= --351.2ln(x)+3754.9, R 2 = 0.84). Projection of the logarithmic regression estimation suggests that the trend of negative correlation of HDI with covid--19 is likely to continue to end--May or early--June 2020. A significant negative correlation indicates that by this time the epidemic shall be significantly greater in states with lower HDI at this time. It has been reported that about 50% of covid--19 cases in India are from 6 urban agglomerations (Mumbai 8359, Delhi 4122, Ahmedabad 3543, Indore 1550, Pune 1339 and Jaipur 961; data on 2 nd May 2020). 16 To determine trends in location--based covid--19 cases and deaths in cities of Jaipur, Delhi and Mumbai we performed microlevel evaluation. In Jaipur (population 2.7 million), the disease was initially reported in travellers, business--persons or students travelling from Italy, Gulf Countries or US in late February to early March 2020, similar to other initial cases in India. 18 These professionals and business people were living in upper SES locations. Within two weeks rapidly increasing number of patients were reported in multiple areas and presently the highest concentration is in low SES locations in the city (Ramganj 521, Ghatgate 52, Shasrtri Nagar 35 and Johari Bazar 29) (Figure 4). Within these hot spots most of the patients are from low SES. In Mumbai",
