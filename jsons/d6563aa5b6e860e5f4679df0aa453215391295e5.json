Despite considerable progress toward understanding the structure-function relationship of TRBP and PACT, their specific roles in these seemingly distinct cellular pathways remain unclear. Both proteins are composed of three copies of the double-stranded RNA-binding domain, two of which interact with dsRNA, while the C-terminal copy mediates protein-protein interactions. PACT and TRBP are found in a complex with the endonuclease Dicer and facilitate processing of immature microRNAs. Their precise contribution to the Dicing step has not yet been defined: possibilities include precursor recruitment, rearrangement of dsRNA within the complex, loading the processed microRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex, and distinguishing different classes of small dsRNA. TRBP and PACT also interact with the viral dsRNA sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). Current models suggest that PACT enables RIG-I to detect a wider range of viral dsRNAs, while TRBP and PACT exert opposing regulatory effects on PKR.

TRBP and PACT are implicated in both Dicing and RISC loading. (b) PACT and TRBP have roles in at least two viral response pathways. First, PACT can facilitate activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (distinguished from cellular dsRNA by distinct molecular features, discussed in section TRBP and PACT mediate innate immune surveillance). This begins a signaling cascade that results in the production of interferon and other antiviral genes. PACT and TRBP also regulate PKR, a kinase that targets the translation initiation factor eIF2 to inhibit protein production and promote apoptosis. TRBP inhibits PKR, while PACT can activate it in response to cellular stress. (c) Both PACT and TRBP contain three double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs).

Several recent reviews have described RIG-I function in more detail. [107] [108] [109] Evidence has emerged that PACT can activate RIG-I in response to a number of viruses 7,110,111 (Table 1) . Although the helicase domains of RIG-I and Dicer are part of the same subfamily, 112 it is unlikely that PACT binds these two proteins in the same manner: there is no evident sequence homology in the helicase insert domain, which forms the PACT-binding site in Dicer. This is consistent with a report that PACT binds to the CTD of RIG-I. 7 There have been no reports of TRBP interacting with RIG-I. Many unanswered questions surround the role of PACT in RIG-I activation. It is unclear under which conditions PACT activates RIG-I, and the mechanism is not known. To date, the interaction has been most studied in the context of Sendai virus, 7,110 a negative sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that infects rodents. In this case, PACT can act to enhance activation of IRF3 and transcription of genes under the control of IFN-. A similar effect was seen for Ebola virus (also a negative sense ssRNA virus), and overexpressing PACT was able to slow viral replication. 110 To counter this effect, Ebola virus encodes a protein that is reported to disrupt the interaction between PACT and both Dicer and RIG-I. 110, 116 An earlier study found that PACT increased type 1 interferon production in response to Newcastle disease virus, which also has a negative sense ssRNA genome. 113 It now appears plausible that this effect was mediated by RIG-I, although it had not been identified at the time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 100, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 195, "end": 196, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 278, "end": 283, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 284, "end": 289, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 290, "end": 295, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 824, "end": 829, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 830, "end": 835, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 836, "end": 841, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1288, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1923, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2065, "text": "110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2069, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 308, "text": "(Figure 4(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 739, "end": 751, "text": "(Figure 1(c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 937, "end": 946, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "PACT Can Stimulate RIG-I Activation"}, {"text": "One hypothesis is that PACT can extend the range of ligands that can activate RIG-I.

First, binding of phosphorylated PACT-D3 to PKR could cause a conformational change that promotes activation. 9 Supporting this model, PACT-D3 alone has been reported to interact weakly with PKR. 9, 130 Alternatively, PACT dimers might bind two molecules of PKR, enhancing PKR dimerization. 43 This is consistent with evidence that PACT-D3 phosphorylation promotes homodimerization and disfavors heterodimerization with TRBP. 42, 43 In contrast, TRBP-D3 has an inhibitory effect on PKR, which appears to be important for preventing inappropriate activation of PKR. 36, 131 A similar inhibitory effect is also observed for truncated PKR or PACT constructs containing only their first two dsRBDs, 9, 132 which suggests that rather than a specific effect of TRBP-D3, anything that binds to the dsRBDs of PKR and disrupts PKR dimerization will cause inhibition.
