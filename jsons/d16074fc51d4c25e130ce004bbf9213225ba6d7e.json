Because of the global imperative to interrupt human to human transmission and to decrease the spread of the disease, local authorities around the world have responded with varying levels of border closures and travel restrictions. This has left very little latitude for any medical repatriation and cross-border movement out of high-risk areas or in high-risk patients until the patient can either be considered not contagious or cured if previously positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, aligned with our mission to ensure that our patients receive appropriate care, exceptions to this new paradigm of limiting repatriation may still be required in situations where local facilities have exceptionally limited capacity or lack suitable medical resources and expertise to treat a specific and in particular life-or limb-threatening condition. In such circumstances, the patient would need to be medically evacuated using accredited Air Ambulance providers and employing appropriate isolation measures during transport. The threshold for undertaking such repatriation is inevitably now much higher than our usual baseline norm. This would require significant levels of coordination between our medical teams, our air ambulance providers and in particular local government authorities in the departing and receiving countries.",

Nevertheless, its core principal will always be the return of victims to their country of origin as early as possible after a calamitous event. This is because such events cause significant emotional distress for both patients and their families and even in countries with high-quality medical capabilities can quickly overwhelm local medical resources. For COVID-19 the key strategy of Public Health Authorities has been and continues at the time of writing to be containment, and as such we foresee having to deal with the medical, psychological and social aspects of this new repatriation paradigm for some time yet.",

The majority would normally be able to return home on commercial flights with appropriate levels of support in place. Current constraints mean that patients in areas considered at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission may find themselves unable to leave quarantine zones.
