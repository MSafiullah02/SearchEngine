The genome of BVDV consists of a positive, single-stranded RNA molecule of \u223c12.3 kb. Reverse genetics of BVDV has been accomplished by construction of full length cDNA clones following the procedures initially developed by Rice et al. (1987) for regeneration of the infectious sindbis virus. Using this strategy, infectious cDNA clones were generated for several pestiviruses and flaviviruses (Agapov et al., 1998, Davis et al., 1989, Mendez et al., 1998, Meyers et al., 1996, Moormann et al., 1996, Ruggli et al., 1996).",

However, this reverse genetics system was not highly reliable since mutations were still observed in BVDV cDNA clones when propagated in bacteria after only a few generations (Mendez et al., 1998, Meyers et al., 1996; our own observation). In an attempt to avoid this problem, a second strategy was used to generate a full length cDNA fragment by in vitro ligation by which Rice et al. (1989) generated infectious yellow fever virus. By this strategy, a reverse genetics system was developed for flavivirus (Sumyoshi et al., 1992) and coronaviruses (Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2002, Yount et al., 2003). However, it was noted that this strategy decreased the quantity of full length viral cDNA template, so that only low transfection efficiency could be achieved in cultured cells (Yount et al., 2000, Yount et al., 2002, Yount et al., 2003).",

Single-copy number BAC plasmids, such as pBeloBACII, had been employed in stable cloning and expression of large DNAs including viral genomic cDNAs, such as coronaviruses, which possess a RNA genome of \u223c30 kb (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2002). The ability of BAC plasmids to contain large cDNA fragments and to propagate easily in bacteria make them useful vectors for cloning of the full length cDNA of BVDV, which possess a genome of \u223c12.3 kb. Here, an improved reverse genetics system for BVDV was developed combining two strategies: (1) cloning a full length viral cDNA as a BAC to improve its stability when propagated in bacteria and (2) use of an in vitro transcription system for generation of infectious RNAs which provided a high transfection efficiency in cultured cells due to the availability of sufficient BAC cDNA template for in vitro transcription. In this study, the cDNA construct results in generation of infectious viral cRNAs harboring correct genomic ends of BVDV SD1. Due to the observation that both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of BVDV genome play a vital role in determining viral RNA infectivity, this system thus probably can provide viral cRNAs with a similar infectivity as that of BVDV SD1 genome.",

Here, a full length cDNA clone of BVDV strain SD1, termed pBSD1, was constructed in a BAC plasmid derived from a single-copy number BAC plasmid, pBeloBACII, and was demonstrated to be stable when evaluated in three different E. coli strains and when incubated at either 28 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. These results showed that the stability of pBSD1 was independent of the bacterial strains and incubation temperatures employed. As expected, in vitro transcribed RNA from the pBSD1 template was homologous with a size of \u223c12.3 kb and highly infectious with a transfection efficiency of 5.0 \u00d7 105\n FFU/\u03bcg RNA in MDBK cells. The recovered progeny virus, BSD1, approached a virus titer of 2.3 \u00d7 107\n FFU/ml, which was comparable to the highest virus titer of wt SD1 and retained the original sequence of pBSD1 as engineered for at least 5 passages in MDBK cells. BSD1 was similar to parental SD1 strain in viral growth kinetics, viral RNA replication, and viral protein expression. Thus, the reverse genetics system described here not only provides a reliable tool for investigation of the life cycle of BVDV but also provides evidence BAC plasmids might be ideal cloning vectors for construction of infectious cDNA clones of other RNA viruses with large genome sizes.",
