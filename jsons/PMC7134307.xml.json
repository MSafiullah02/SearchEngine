Fake news or misinformation is defined as fabricated information presented as the truth [6]. It is the publication of known false information and sharing it amongst individuals [7]. It is the intentional publishing of misleading information and can be verified as false through fact-checking [2]. Social media platforms allow individuals to fast share information with only a click of a single share button [4]. In previous studies the effect of the spreading and exposure to misleading information have been investigated [6]. Some studies determined that everyone has problems with identifying fake news, not just users of a certain age, gender or education [11]. The literacy and education of fake news is essential in the combating of the spreading of false information [8].",

The desire that social media users have to enhance themselves on social media platforms could blur the lines between real information and false information [12]. Consequently, social media users will share information to gain social approval and to build their image [12]. Recent studies have shown that certain false information can be strengthened if it belongs to the individuals in the same social environment [23]. The real power lies with those certain individuals who are more vocal or influential [24]. The need for social media users to endorse information or a message can be driven by the perception the social media user has about the messenger [25]. These messengers or \u201cinfluencers\u201d can be anyone ranging from celebrities to companies [24].",

Social spammers have also become more popular over the last few years with the goal to launch different kinds of attacks on social media users, for example spreading viruses or phishing [2]. Fake reviews have also been known to disrupt the online community through writing reviews that typically aim to direct people away from a certain product or person [2].

Upon retrieving multiple reasons for the spreading of false information, they were categorized into main factors and sub-factors. These factors included social factors, cognitive factors, political factors, financial factors and malicious factors. Considering the rapidly expanding social media environment, it was found that especially social factors have a very significant influence in the sharing of fake news on social media platforms. Its sub-factors of conformity and peer-influence; social comparison and satire and humorous fakes have great influence when deciding to share false information. Secondly, it was concluded that malicious factors like hate propaganda also fuel the sharing of false information with the possibility to financially gain or to do harm.",

Fact-checking resources are available but the existence thereof is fairly unknown and therefore often unused. Hopefully better knowledge and education will encourage a desire among social media users to be more aware of possible unchecked information and the sources of information and to stop the forwarding of false information. A better understanding of the motives behind the sharing of false information can potentially prepare social media users to be more vigilant when sharing information on social media.
