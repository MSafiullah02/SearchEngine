Case isolation was done from day zero in Delhi, lock down was implemented from 20th day of reporting of reporting of the index case till 3rd May 2020 (62nd day). We also assumed that the effect of lockdown and social distancing interventions may be shown after 7 days which is half of maximum incubation period. The effective reproductive rate (Rt) under public health interventions was calculated by multiplying the reduction fractions assumed for the intervention with R0. The parameters used for modelling are provided in Table 1\n. The number of notified cases of tuberculosis in 2018 for Delhi was obtained from India Tuberculosis report 2019 and was considered as the estimated prevalence of tuberculosis case in Delhi.

First, since the rate of severe COVID-19 is higher among TB patients, the program needs to focus of primary prevention measures like adequate ventilation, queuing with physical distancing of at-least 1 meters and preferable airborne control measures needs to be maintained in all TB care centres to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV2 infection. Second, the TB patients and their family members needs to be educated on measures to protect against COVID-19 including respiratory hygiene, regular hand washing with soap water, social distancing and avoid touching of the face, mouth and eyes. Third, there is an urgent need for surveillance of TB patients on DOTS anti-tubercular therapy reporting for symptoms of flu-like illness that could be suggestive of COVID-19 disease. Particular attention is required for TB cases reporting with acute breathlessness which can be symptomatic of severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, ensuring continuing of DOTS by provision of timely refills to patients with TB to fulfil obligations under the universal health care requirements is required. This would also potentially reduce their susceptibility to SARS-CoV2.17 Resolution of any TB drug related stock-outs or associated procurement challenges warrant urgent prioritization.17\n",

SEIR model is a compartmental model and assumes closed population which might be violated in the actual scenario.18 However, because of lockdown the migration is effectively controlled in Delhi. The results of the study needs to be interpreted with caution since the estimation of excess risk of severe disease of COVID-19 in TB patients was based on a study in China having a small sample size.4 However, due to lack of other studies from high burden TB countries we used the results of this study.",
