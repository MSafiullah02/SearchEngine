On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 15 of the 59 cases of pneumonia were caused by a novel coronavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19) [3] . On the same day, information about the new coronavirus was presented to the international community through the International Health Regulations (IHR) alert system. Immediately after receiving this announcement, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate, which is a public administration authority involved in public health services in Poland, established a response team responsible for developing guidelines and evidence-based strategies for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [4] . The present study aimed to: (1) present public health interventions aimed at mitigating the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 implemented in Poland between January 9 and March 29, 2020, and (2) analyze the potential impact of these regulations on the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland.",

The key activity in the last week of January was constant monitoring of the sanitary and epidemiological situation at the border administrative regions (voivodships), airports, and seaports.

On the same day, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate recommended that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to Northern Italy (a total of 9 countries, including China, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan) [19] . Due to the growing number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, guidelines for medical staff were regularly updated. Moreover, several guidelines and recommendations were developed for specific professional groups as well as public and private entities. On February 29, 87 people were hospitalized as suspected COVID-19 cases, 146 were quarantined, and 3370 were under epidemiological supervision. the resulting crises situations [20] . This act provided administrative, budgetary, and epidemiological measures to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 (as presented in Table 1 ).
