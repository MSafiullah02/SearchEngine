Since then, the virus has been detected in all continents [Nissen et al., 2002; Peret et al., 2002; Stockton et al., 2002; Cuevas et al., 2003; Freymuth et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Fodha et al., 2004]. Human metapneumovirus is the single human pathogen within the genus Metapneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. Serological studies suggest that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least the past 60 years [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Ebihara et al., 2003; Mejias et al., 2004]. However, recent evidence from molecular studies suggests that hMPV may have diverged from the avian metapneumovirus type C as early as 200 years ago [de Graaf et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009].",

When the DFA was negative, samples were inoculated onto HuH7 cell lines grown in 48\u2010well microplates as described previously [Freymuth et al., 2005]. Briefly, after four days of incubation, HuH7 cells were harvested and used for DFA with the same antiviral antibodies.

Human metapneumovirus infection was assessed in nasal aspirates received in the laboratory during the months of November to March in order to perform a comparison of hMPV rate with the other common cold viruses. It was reported that, the hMPV infection season is longer than that of hRSV or influenza viruses [van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2006]. As such, the number of positive cases may have been underestimated although it was shown previously that hMPV circulates predominantly during the winter\u2013spring period [Bastien et al., 2003a; van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2004; Pitoiset et al., 2010]. The number and the percentage of hMPV detected in virus\u2010negative samples during the epidemics of 2002\u20132003, 2003\u20132004, and 2004\u20132005 were 59 (10%), 17 (22.6%), and 52 (8.8%), respectively. The incidence of hMPV infections are reported in many other studies [Boivin et al., 2002; van den Hoogen et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2004]. It is also suggested that the number of hMPV infections is variable from one winter to another [Falsey et al., 2003; Mackay et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2006].",

Three\u2010quarters of the hMPV were detected on children under 2 years old and more than one third on those less than 6 months old. Human respiratory syncytial virus was the most predominant virus observed with an increase in prevalency in children under 2 years old. Influenza A virus was more commonly encountered in the population of over 2 years old. Unlike the hMPV and the other isolated viruses, the influenza A and B viruses show a distinct prevalence between children under 2 years old and those over 2 years old.",

In fact, hMPV and hRSV outbreaks showed the same variation during the winter months [Boivin et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004]. The influenza epidemic profile, which might be a more independent entity, did not correlate with hMPV or hRSV. During these three winters, the influenza A virus is more prominent than influenza B virus and the percentage was appreciatively the same for that described in Europe [Paget et al., 2003; Meijer et al., 2006].",

Unlike upper respiratory tract infections, human metapneumovirus infection is normally associated with an acute LRI as observed in the present study and in other previous reports [Boivin et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004]. Indeed, some patients present with only gastroenteritis in the absence of altered respiratory signs. No difference in severity of clinical manifestation was observed between the infection with group A or group B.",

The RT\u2010PCR was designed for the M gene to detect hMPV and to have an equivalent sensitivity for both genotypes. The M gene appeared to be suitable for hMPV detection, since it has already been validated [Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005; Chano et al., 2005] and a genetic discrimination has been determined [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Bastien et al., 2003b; Carr et al., 2005; Chano et al., 2005]. Moreover, the M gene seems to be a good candidate for the detection of other viruses like influenza viruses or coronaviruses [Donofrio et al., 1992; Vabret et al., 2001]. This PCR appears to be adapted to hMPV detection and characterization since the four hMPV clusters described were amplified successfully [van den Hoogen et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2004].",

The rate of the different subgroups was not the same for each winter and the strain composition varied during each outbreak. The strains circulating in France were described in four previous studies [Freymuth et al., 2003; Bouscambert\u2010Duchamp et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006; Pitoiset et al., 2010]. The first two studies reported only A1 and A2 subtypes of hMPV, while Foulongne et al. 2006 detected four subtypes of the virus with an A1 subgroup in predominance. The last study [Pitoiset et al., 2010] reports on a phylogenic analysis carried out on 100 strains isolated over 8 years, from 2002 to 2009 with alternative subgroup predominance. During the first winter 2002\u20132003, the A group was the most prevalent, with 87.5% of A2 subgroup being the most prominent. This repartition was also found in many other parts of the world [Esper et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2004; Ludewick et al., 2005; Pitoiset et al., 2010]. Two studies described another pattern of circulation of the virus during the winter of 2002\u20132003 in which a prevalent B1 subgroup was noted [Gerna et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2006]. For the winter of 2003\u20132004, no predominant group could be identified. The incidence of groups A and B were approximately the same, although the number of strains belonging to group B and A were nine and eight, respectively. The B2 and A2 subgroup were the most frequently identified with five strains for each cluster. During this same period in Italy (winter of 2003\u20132004), the A2 subtype was also the most prominent strain, even if other strains were present [Sarasini et al., 2006; Gerna et al., 2005]. The rate of occurrence of group B was confirmed during the winter of 2004\u20132005 and represented 96% of all hMPV detected, including one hMPV B2 strain. Over the three winter periods, 46.5% of B1, 37.5% of A2, 8% of A1, and 8% of B2 strains were observed. These data are closely related to those proposed by Mackay et al. 2006 in a study carried out in Australia during the same period. In addition, both predominant subgroups found in 2002 and 2004 were the same (viz., A2 and B1).",

            "text": "The RNA fragment studied is small (405 bp), but some mutations that were found in this gene allowed us to discriminate between, and compare, the different isolates. The sequence analysis for the three epidemic periods showed two distinct genetic profiles. The first profile, found during the winter of 2002\u20132003 and 2004\u20132005, seemed to be composed of two predominant strains showing exactly the same sequence (Cae03\u20106\u201031 and Cae05\u201040\u201027) which represented at least 52% of hMPV detected, increasing to 79.5% in 2002\u20132003. During these two winters (2002\u20132003 and 2004\u20132005), the foremost strains belonged to the A2 and B1 subgroups, respectively. This finding corroborates previous observations [Mackay et al., 2006]. For the winter period 2003\u20132004, the isolated strains belonged to the four subgroups and, at the most, two identical sequences were found. Even if it is impossible to consider these isolates like different strains because the analysis was assessed on too short a RNA fragment, such heterogeneity was not observed during the other winter periods and might be considered as the beginning of a shift from group A to group B as confirmed by the data of 2004. A shift of this nature was reported previously [Agapov et al., 2006; Mackay et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2009]. However, no evolution can be established from the heterogenic composition of hMPV infection during the winter of 2003\u20132004 to the subgroup B1 predominance during the winter of 2004\u20132005. The B1 strain responsible for 52% of hMPV infection during the winter of 2004\u20132005 was not found during the previous winter of 2003\u20132004.",

Human metapneumovirus is circulating in Normandy at a rate equivalent to that described previously [Peret et al., 2002; Bastien et al., 2003a; Boivin et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004]. The present clinical study demonstrates that hMPV is responsible for LRI in the majority of cases studied. All the reported hMPV subgroups are present in France but not with the same incidence each year. The results confirm the genetic evolution of hMPV in Normandy with a switch from the A group to the B group being noted during the winter of 2003\u20132004. Finally, molecular tools developed for the M gene appear to be useful for diagnosis and molecular analysis, since the four subgroups are detected and can be discriminated between in a significant manner.",
