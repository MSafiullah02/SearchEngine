            "text": "The need for novel chemical compounds to treat human diseases is ever increasing. The rapid development of drug-resistant microbes, the discovery of new cases of life-threatening infections, and the constant recurrence of diseases have pushed for advances in the field of drug discovery (Strobel et al., 2004, Demain, 2000). In principle, there are three pathways for discovering new pharmacologically significant compounds: rational drug design, where the drug is purposefully tailored towards specific targets in the microbial cell (Mandal et al., 2009); combinatorial chemistry, which involves synthesis of a combinatorial library of compounds, which are then tested against the cellular target to determine the most potent compounds (Gallop et al., 1994); and natural product discovery, by isolating bioactive compounds from biological sources (Strohl, 2000). Of late, pharmaceutical companies have shifted their interest towards the first two pathways. These pathways utilise the latest advances in three-dimensional X-ray crystallography, drug-docking tools, and other computer-aided methodologies (M\u00fcller, 2009) which significantly cut the development time of a compound, from compound synthesis to market delivery. There are, however, downfalls with these approaches, including the high cost to discover novel compounds and for production. Moreover, until the detailed mechanisms of targeted cellular death and survival are comprehensively elucidated, it will remain difficult to select potential targets for structure-guided drug design (Barry and Blanchard, 2010). Furthermore, being laboratory-synthesised compounds, combinatorial compounds are often insufficiently complex, possessing limited structural rigidity, and require extensive purification steps and bioactivity testing to conclusively characterise the bioactive compounds (Baker et al., 2000). In addition, there has been a steady increase in the negative public perception regarding the use of synthetic drugs due to their long-term safety and environmental concerns (Strobel and Daisy, 2003). Consequently, efforts are being made to re-explore the potential of natural products as sources of novel drugs (Fig. 1\n).",

They constitute almost 50% of the new drugs introduced to the market from 1981 to 2010, and approximately 75% of anti-infective agents are natural products or natural-product derivatives (Newman and Cragg, 2010). Most bioactive natural products have the ability to target specific proteins coded by essential genes (Kingston, 2011). While it is understood that this property cannot be fully utilised for human genetically linked diseases due to the more complex human protein-protein interactions (Dan\u010d\u00edk et al., 2010), this attribute has been widely explored for the treatment of infectious diseases, as these compounds are able to specifically target the infective agents (Kingston, 2011). For example, beta-lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and the cephalosporins, are largely used for their broad antibacterial spectrum and outstanding safety profile for human use (Danziger and Neuhauser, 2011).",

Of this, only approximately 6% have been screened for biological activity (Verpoorte, 2000). Medicinal plant use can be traced to ancient agricultural societies, where indigenous populations have utilised them as therapies for many diseases (Davis, 1995). Even in the modern era, approximately 80% of the world's population, particularly those in the developing countries, still rely on herbal medicines for their primary healthcare (Gurib-Fakim, 2006). Historically, plants with healing properties have been discovered and utilised even before the cause of the disease has been fully identified. Not surprisingly, the trial and error approach has been utilised for generations in these cultures to discover plants of medicinal value.",

At times, a large quantity of plant is required to produce sufficient amounts of the bioactive compounds for clinical use. In other cases, compounds have been isolated from endangered or highly endemic plants. This raises major concerns regarding biodiversity conservation. Plant tissue culture offers a solution (McAlpine et al., 1999), although the cost of such production methods is high. One of the advances in addressing these issues is the discovery that microorganisms residing inside the plant tissues may produce similar, if not the same, bioactive compounds as their plant hosts. From a commercial point of view, it is relatively easier to scale up the fermentation process of microbes, enabling large-scale production of biologically active compounds to meet industrial demands. These microorganisms present the opportunity to discover a plethora of compounds and offer a renewable source of natural products.",

In other cases endophytes release metabolites which activate host defence mechanism against other pathogenic organisms, in a process known as induced systemic resistance (Kloepper and Ryu, 2006). Similarly, endophytes can also promote plant growth in an attempt to outcompete cell apoptosis induced by infecting pathogens (Berg and Hallmann, 2006). Plant growth promotion by endophytes may be exerted by several mechanisms, such as production of phytohormones (Tudzynski, 1997), synthesis of siderophores (O'Sullivan and O\u2019Gara, 1992), nitrogen fixation, solubilisation of minerals such as phosphorus (Richardson et al., 2009), or via enzymatic activities, such as ethylene suppression by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (Glick et al., 1998). The plant host also benefits from the endophytes by their natural resistance to soil contaminants (Siciliano et al., 2001), their ability to degrade xenobiotics, or their action as vectors to introduce degradative traits to plants, which substantially assist phytoremediation (Ryan et al., 2008).",

The compound was initially isolated from the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia (Wani et al., 1971), a traditional medicinal plant used by Native Americans (Gunther, 1945). Since then, several other plants from the genus Taxus have been reported to produce Taxol. Nonetheless, these plants are slow-growing with generally isolated geographical distribution. Investigations of endophytes from this plant revealed that some fungi, such as Taxomyces andreanae, also produced the exact same compound (Stierle et al., 1995). The biological production of this compound in Taxus plants have been characterised (Fig. 2\n). While horizontal gene transfer has long been proposed for the biosynthesis of Taxol in endophytes, it has been recently showed that the endophyte genomes did not contain any sequences with significant homology to the Taxol biosynthetic genes from Taxus spp. (Heinig et al., 2013), indicating Taxol biosynthesis in endophytes might have developed independently from its plant host. Nevertheless, this example supports the rationale that traditional medicinal plants can be used as the starting point to investigate endophytes for their production of biologically active compounds.",

In linear (type A) NRPSs, the multiple modules are arranged in a sequential fashion, where each module incorporates one monomer in to the growing chain during each production cycle. In contrast, in iterative (type B) NPRS systems, the modules or domains are used multiple times in the assembly of a single product, thus creating a multimeric peptide consisting of repeated smaller sequences. The third type, non-linear (type C) NRPSs are the most sophisticated system, consisting of domains and modules organised in a non-conventional manner.

Polyketides are natural products synthesised by polyketide synthases (PKS) which are also large multimodular enzyme complexes that function similarly to a fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006). Resembling the NRPS system, there are three core domains in a typical PKS system: acyltransferase (AT), which acts as the gatekeeper for substrate specificity, selecting and activating the monomers and the intermediate acyl chain; acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), whose phosphopantetheine arm covalently attaches the growing intermediate acyl chain; and ketosynthase (KS) which catalyses C\u2014C bond formation via Claisen condensation in the elongation of the polyketide chain (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006). Termination is achieved by the action of the thioesterase (TE) domain.",

Type I PKSs are multifunctional enzymes linearly arranged into modules, each of which consists of a set of non-iteratively acting domains responsible for the catalysis of one cycle of chain elongation (Bisang et al., 1999). Erythromycin, a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, is one of the most well-studied compounds of this type (Rawlings, 2001). First discovered from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the compound consists of a 14-membered macrolactone ring and two glucose derived deoxysugar moieties desosamine and cladinose (3-O-methylmycarose). The construction of its precursor, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-deB) is controlled by a large modular protein known as 6-deB synthase (DEBS) (Fig. 4A). Type II PKSs consist of several monofunctional enzymes acting iteratively, resulting in the production of polyphenols or other aromatic polyketides (Hertweck et al., 2007). An example of this type is the anti-tumour antibiotic doxorubicin, which is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces peucetius ATCC29050 (Fig. 4B) (Grimm et al., 1994). Type III PKSs, also known as chalcone synthase-like PKSs, are homodimeric enzymes consisting of multiple ACP-independent modules which essentially are iterative condensing enzymes. Biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, an antibiotic against plant pathogens, from endophytic Pseudomonas fluorescens Q2-87 is known to involve a type III polyketide synthase (Fig. 3C) (Gita Bangera and Thomashow, 1999).",

Provided that the drug is able to penetrate the cell wall, mycobacteria have another complementary system that coordinates resistance to antibiotics inhibiting cytoplasmic targets. On the other hand, M. tuberculosis is known to possess genomic plasticity (Domenech et al., 2001). Most cases of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis develop via mutations of the target genes, such as rpoB against rifampicin, rrs against kanamycin, and gyrA against the fluoroquinones. Multidrug resistance occurs via the accumulation of independent mutations in more than one of these genes (Rattan et al., 1998).",

Plants have long been viewed as a common source of remedies, either in the form of traditional preparations or as pure active principles. This forms a strong basis to utilise local plants that have been traditionally used as medicine and investigate them for their active chemical constituents. In fact, Norman R. Farnsworth, one of the pioneers in the field of pharmacognosy (study of traditional medicines), highlighted that in 1985, there were 119 compounds isolated from 90 plants which were utilised as single entity medicinal agents (Farnsworth et al., 1985). Most importantly, 77% of these compounds were obtained as a result of examining the plant based on an ethnomedical use, and were utilised in a manner similar to their traditional use. This emphasises the rationale of investigating traditional medicinal plants for chemical discovery.",

Nonetheless, fine screening, purification, and identification methods are required to target active compounds since each microorganism may contain a large pool of compounds with only few being bioactive. An example is the culturable endophytes from traditional Chinese medicinal plants (Miller et al., 2012). Bacterial and fungal endophytes from eight plants, traditionally used for anticancer therapy, were screened genetically for the presence of PKS and NRPS systems. Assays investigating antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxicity traits were also performed using crude extracts from these endophytes. The eight plants hosted 74 bacterial endophytes belonging to 14 genera, as well as 36 fungal endophytes from 10 genera. Moreover, 12% of bacterial endophytes and 58% of fungal endophytes possessed PKS machinery, while 13% of bacterial endophytes and 17% of fungal endophtyes had at least NRPS gene cluster. All of the endophytes equipped with either PKS and/or NRPS system exhibited anti-proliferative effects in at least one bioassay. From this example, it was shown that traditional medicinal plants harbour endophytes producing bioactive natural products. There was also a strong correlation between PKS/NRPS genes and bioactivity. Thus, combining genetic- and bioactivity-based de-replication steps, a streamlined method for bioactive natural product discovery was developed.",

Approximately three-quarters of the country's population consume various types of jamu on a regular basis for healthcare (Steffan et al., 2005). As with all traditional medicines, the development of jamu started by random experiments to discover the beneficial properties of plants (Stevensen, 1999).
