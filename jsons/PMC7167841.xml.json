The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 2143 children (aged 0\u201018 years) with laboratory\u2010confirmed or suspected COVID\u201019; one death was reported in this group.\n4\n The most common symptoms are fever (65%) and cough (45%).\n5\n Up to one\u2010third of reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed\u2010positive pediatric patients remain completely asymptomatic.\n6\n However, 6% of all pediatric patients with COVID\u201019 developed severe/critical illness, with upwards of 11% of infants under the age of 1 year developing severe/critical disease.\n4\n\n",

These authors suggested that this finding, coupled with a higher procalcitonin level in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected pediatric patients suggests a higher likelihood of coinfection in pediatric patients.\n9\n This highlights another key difference in clinical features of COVID\u201019 in pediatric patients as compared to adults and warns clinicians to monitor for signs of bacterial superinfection or coinfection with influenza or other viruses, and conversely to not rule out the possibility of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the setting of a positive flu swab.",

In the meantime, we should proceed with caution; optimizing treatments for underlying lung disease seems prudent. Furthermore, minimizing cough related to asthma could reduce the potential aerosolization of the virus in an otherwise asymptomatic carrier. In that same vein, choosing hydrofluoroalkane\u2010inhaler administered medications over nebulizers will also help reduce the aerosolized virus.",
