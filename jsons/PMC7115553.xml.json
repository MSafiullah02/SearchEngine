Although it is unrealistic to think that expenditures on overseas travel could precede day-to-day necessities, the assumption in the literature directly follows a syllogism based on two fundamental premises. First, it is widely acknowledged that international tourism is considered a luxury good rather than a normal good (Lim, 1997), in that tourists must commit significant expenditures on costly goods such as airfare and hotels (Bakkal & Scaperlanda, 1991). Second, since it is a luxury good, demand should be dependent on the discretionary income of consumers (Crouch, 1992), which is the proportion of real earnings after normal expenses (i.e. food, living, medical) are deducted.",

Concurrent with evidence that international tourism is indeed a luxury good, a number of studies have advocated using real discretionary or disposable income in tourism demand models whenever it is available rather than crude income per capita variants, such as Gross Domestic Product or Gross National Income (Durbarry and Sinclair, 2003; Lim, 1997; Song, Romilly, & Liu, 2000).",

Despite the high significance and compelling results (Crouch, 1996) of said income variables, it is still possible that other income-related factors play a role in determining international tourism demand. Certainly, the absolute availability of cash flows is likely to place a strict upper limit on tourism demand. If an individual or household does not have the wealth to purchase luxury goods, without doubt there will be less consumption. Yet, we cannot safely extend this logic to suggest that demand will consistently lead to the consumption of tourism goods or travel by using a constant proportion of discretionary income.",

For example, an increase in housing prices may lead to enhanced expectations of future wealth (or in some cases an actual gain should the house be sold) for home owners. At the same time, housing costs such as rent would generally increase along with housing prices. Consequently, an increase in housing prices would imply a net negative wealth effect for those who do not own their homes. This part of demand may decrease consumption based on unfavorable expectations regarding future income and costs. Another example can be drawn from Ogawa, Kitasaka, Yamaoka, and Iwata (1996), who found that the liquidity of unrealized wealth is also an important determinant of consumption. Even if the asset appreciates the owners may not view it as a capital gain due to illiquidity of the asset, a lack of information on reference prices, or consumption needs such as continued residence.",

This is intuitive as the amount of investment is likely to determine the potential income or return, and therefore govern expectations for future income.

Further, the asset's value should remain relatively stable over time and be traded constantly while price information needs to be consistently disseminated. In order to ensure that owners actively respond to the wealth effect by changing consumption patterns, the effect on luxury goods should be tested rather than normal or inferior goods.

Consistent price increases have led Korean apartments to become an actively traded asset in the wealth portfolios of middle-class households. Information on prices and rents are readily available (Hwang, Quigley, & Son, 2006). According to the National Statistics Office of Korea, in 2006 the wealth of Korean households was deeply concentrated in real estate (76.8%) and financial assets (20.4%), while other assets accounted for only 2.7 percent. In essence, the wealth of the Korean people is concentrated in just two asset types, which are broadly held and actively traded with accurate and immediate dissemination of price information.",

It is crucial to examine this causal relationship in order to improve our understanding of deterministic tourism demand models (Song & Li, 2008). Although the wealth effect may not be universal or present in every economy, in cases where tourism demand is significantly affected by not only current earnings but also expectations on future earnings, estimation of tourism consumption behavior based on contemporaneous income may be erroneous. In turn, misunderstanding consumption behaviors implies ineffective and misguided pricing and marketing strategies for tourism products and targeting of demand segments. Moreover, by identifying another driver of tourism efficiency in demand forecasting and modeling may be improved. Implications and suggestions are presented along with the findings of the study.",

Nearly 81 percent of all new housing in the country between 1995 and 2000 were apartments, while as of 2005 they accounted for more than half of the housing stock in Korea (Ham & Lee, 2010). Apartments are highly standardized in terms of amenities, floor plans, and building materials. The housing market shares similar expectations when information on an apartment's location, size, and year built are provided. Homogeneous expectations combined with low transaction costs have led to easy trading and rental of apartments among individuals. As a result, the Korean apartment market is deeper and more active than most other housing markets (Hwang et al., 2006). This high volume of active trading and ease of comparability facilitate the construction and dissemination of reliable reference prices. Such information is usually offered free of cost and flows instantaneously as brokers are located in most neighborhoods and provide daily information on price movements. Thus, individuals have a very accurate estimate of housing prices.",

Moreover, the proportion of real estate in wealth portfolios for various income groups in Korea is consistent.

Consequently, outbound tourism, a luxury good, may be consumed to a greater extent by aggregate demand when expectations of permanent increases in wealth are pervasive. Thus, we developed the following hypothesis:Hypothesis 1Appreciation of apartments will increase demand for outbound travel in Korea.Meanwhile, a similar effect can be anticipated from the Korean stock market. Although much smaller than the equity markets of developed countries, the Korean Stock Exchange is fairly sizable in terms of market capitalization and is the 14th largest stock exchange in the world (Kim, Baek, Noh, & Kim, 2007). The equity market involves frequent trading and is as liquid as the stock markets of many developed countries, such as the US, England, Germany, and Japan. The Korea Statistical Office reported in 2007 that financial assets are consistently held by different income groups; the proportion of household wealth invested in the financial market is practically the same across society, with 19.0% for the highest income group and 19.1% for the lowest income group.The high volatility of the Korean stock market has been noted (Fratzscher & Oh, 2002) and investments in the equity market by Korean households are considerably lower than in the housing market. It is possible, however, that increases in financial wealth can also stimulate the consumption of outbound tourism if stock price increases are perceived as permanent wealth gains and consumption is adjusted according to the adaptive expectations of future earnings. Therefore, the second hypothesis was developed based on the wealth effect from the stock market:\nHypothesis 2Appreciation of stocks will increase demand for outbound travel in Korea.\n",

There are two noteworthy observations to be made based on the data in the figure and tables. Price appreciation, and, therefore, cumulative returns on apartments, were greater than stocks during the sample period, while at the same time the movements were less volatile. In effect, it is possible that the appreciation of apartments is more likely to be perceived as a permanent gain in wealth than stock appreciation. It should also to be noted that incomes and the prices of apartments and stocks are highly and significantly correlated. When the wealth effect is significant, omitting asset variables and including only income as an explanatory variable is likely to cause a misspecification bias, which would result in overestimation of the income elasticity of demand.",

The use of a log-linear model allows easy interpretation of the results as the elasticity of demand where the units of data for the current study are difficult to interpret (Wang, 2009), while the log-linear form is also widely advocated for its robustness against heteroscedasticity (Wang, 1995).",

In addition, no variable had a VIF exceeding the potential problematic level of 10. We inferred that much of the collinearity expected from Table 2 is alleviated after the logarithmic transformation (Buongiorno, 1977; Grime & Smith, 1982). Also, in order to address the concerns of endogeneity from omitted-variable bias we identified the factors that influence housing prices in Asia as: construction costs, household income, household formation, housing supply, stock prices, and monetary supply (Chen & Patel, 1998). Among these factors, those that may have an effect on tourism demand (income and stock prices) entered the regression equation as explanatory variables as ln(INCOMEt) and ln(KOSPIt), relieving concerns of endogeneity.",

Although including the lagged dependent variable does not create a bias in the coefficients, it is expected to underestimate the variance of the estimator in the presence of positive autocorrelation, thereby overstating the significance of the coefficients (Wooldridge, 2002). In order to conduct an efficient estimation and obtain reliable results, the current study implemented two different estimation techniques: Prais\u2013Winsten and ordinary least squares (OLS) with Newey\u2013West standard errors. Estimators and statistics from the Prais\u2013Winsten procedure are asymptotically efficient and valid for autoregressive models of the first-order, while the Newey\u2013West procedure provides a robust inference of serial correlations of a higher-order (Traub & Jayne, 2004). More specifically, if the model to be estimated includes a first-order autoregressive disturbance term, the Prais\u2013Winsten method transforms the error vector that yields serially uncorrelated classical disturbances (Baltagi, Song, Jung, & Koh, 2007). In the presence of higher-order lags, the Newey\u2013West method allows for the robust inference of standard errors on the coefficients (Ferson, Sarkissian, & Simin, 2003) and is standard in the economics literature (Greene, 2008).",

One possibility is that the high volatility of stock prices might prevent owners from viewing the appreciation as a permanent gain. The insignificant results could also be attributed to inefficient estimation; quarterly data may have insufficient sensitivity as stock prices are highly volatile in nature, as seen in Fig. 1. Yet another possibility is that the wealth effect from financial assets could be insignificant at the aggregate level. This may be due to a comparably low allocation of relative wealth in the stock market, which accounts for less than 20% of total household wealth, whereas housing assets account for more than 75%. The smaller amount of total investments in equity stocks, which resulted in a trivial absolute increase in expected wealth, may also account for the result (Cho, 2006).",

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) decreased outbound travel demand by approximately 4 percent. A possible explanation for the insignificant coefficient of the 9/11DUMMY variable is the effect of substitution to other destinations. Although trips to the US from Korea significantly declined immediately after the 9/11 attack, total outbound demand may have been sustained by substituting other nearby destinations, such as Southeast Asia or Oceania, that had a relatively lower perceived risk of terrorism (Lim, 2004).",

Even though the wealth effect may only be conditionally present for certain economies and asset types, Korean economy tourism demand can be partly explained by appreciation in housing assets. For example, tourist surveys often utilize the income levels of tourists to explain tourism demand or expenditure (Jang, Bai, Hong, & O'Leary, 2004; Jang, Ismail, & Ham, 2002). However, in order to produce more efficient estimates of income and/or price effects on tourism goods, changes in net assets and the relative location of a person in the society's wealth distribution curve can be taken into account. Income and wealth variables are likely to be correlated with one another since they are both subject to the greater movements of the national economy. This suggests that efficiency of conventional tourism demand models can be enhanced and their accuracy improved by utilizing important wealth variables.",
