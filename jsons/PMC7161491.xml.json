On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). As of April 7, 1,279,722 cases were confirmed, and 72,616 (5.7%) patients died in 211 countries. In the beginning of the outbreak, COVID-19 was considered a zoonotic disease with limited human-to-human transmission. Initially, pneumonia cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Soon after, this emerging coronavirus was found to be highly infectious. The basic reproductive number ranged from 2.2 to 3.58, with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days.1, 2, 3\n",

Categorical data were compared with the chi-square test. A p-value less than 0.05 by a two-tailed test was considered statistically significant. When at least 3 studies with available data reported the same characteristic, we used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) to conduct meta-analysis. We used random effects models to calculate the pooled frequency among each clinical manifestation or outcome. The results are expressed as incidences and 95% CIs. I2 was calculated to examine statistical heterogeneity across the included studies. I2 > 50% and a p < 0.05 were considered substantial heterogeneity. Egger precision weighted linear regression tests and funnel plots were used to test potential publication bias. If publication bias was present, the trim and fill method would be performed and Rosenthal's Fail-safe N would be calculated to evaluate the effect.",

            "text": "Compared with other pandemic or epidemic viral illnesses, the small numbers of cases and low mortality rate in pediatric COVID-19 are of great interest. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is proposed to be the key factor. ACE2 is the primary entry receptor for both coronaviruses. After replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues from SARS-CoV, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is weaker.27 Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 still exhibits significant binding affinity to human ACE2. The binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 partially explains why it causes less severe disease than SARS-CoV but remains highly infectious. However, this result did not answer the question of why children are spared from severe COVID-19. In previous studies, SARS-CoV induced higher ACE2 shedding than human coronavirus NL63. The differential downregulation of ACE2 is related to lung injury.28 In one study about the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), increasing age led to an imbalance of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system, which correlates with aggravated inflammation and enhanced lung injury in a rat model.29 Nevertheless, no age-dependent differences in ACE and ACE2 were seen in a prospective observational cohort study.30 There is one hypothesis that smoking increases ACE2 expression and thus enhances coronavirus entry into pulmonary epithelial cells.31 Undoubtedly, smoking is more prevalent among adults than among children. Nonetheless, some controversies exist.32 Another important fact is that children rarely have underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular diseases, as adults do. These underlying diseases may predispose patients to critical conditions during COVID-19. However, the definite pathogenesis is unknown. Therefore, the severity difference between adults and children with COVID-19 needs more investigation.",

In China, clinicians should have a suspicion of COVID-19 when patients meet one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations. According to our literature review, the main symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are fever and cough, resembling common viral illness frequently encountered in school or kindergarten.33 Epidemiological features are the main diagnostic clue. Children with familial clustering, contact with infected cases, travel or living in areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onset are at risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Since COVID-19 has spread to many other countries, the epidemiological history should be modified outside mainland China. In addition, asymptomatic cases are a potential source of infection. Although only 1% of the patients had been reported as asymptomatic,24 26% of infected children were asymptomatic in the pooled data. Namely, children may act as silent carriers or spreaders.34 Notably, an asymptomatic infection does not always mean a carrier. Chan et al. presented a familial cluster with one family member, a 10-year-old boy, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Without symptoms, he had ground glass lung opacities identified incidentally by CT scan.35 A similar scenario occurred in another report: chest CT performed in one asymptomatic child revealed patchy density.16 This finding raised another issue that needs to be further considered. According to our review, the radiographic findings in pediatric COVID-19 are similar to those in adults.36 In China, chest CT has been used as a screening tool for COVID-19. The disease severity and clinical suspicion are associated with radiographic findings. However, this diagnostic policy might not be applicable in all countries.",

Unfortunately, presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.38\n,\n39 The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via asymptomatic children is reasonable. To date, no clustering or asymptomatic transmission among children has been documented. There are some possible explanations. First, the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred during winter vacation for students. Moreover, the Chinese government imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions in Hubei Province beginning on January 24, 2020. Furthermore, the government announced that the Lunar New Year holiday would be extended to February 2, 2020 across the country. The new semester in school will also be postponed indefinitely. These events limited the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 within school-age children. However, contact tracing and case isolation alone may be unlikely to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in pediatric groups when a new semester starts.",

Third, there are often multiple viral infections that mimic COVID-19 circulating in the same class or the same school. In areas outside China, how to recognize COVID-19 early in children and implement infection control is an urgent problem. Fourth, the treatment strategy in children may need additional debate and caution. In some pediatric cases in China, lopinavir, ritonavir and inhaled recombinant human interferon alpha have been applied. However, the efficacy and safety have not yet been reported.",
