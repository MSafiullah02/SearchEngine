The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the third coronavirus to be declared as a pandemic in 21st century after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) also achieved similar status in 2003 and 2012 respectively (Ramadan and Shaib, 2019; Zhong et al., 2003). On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) country office in Wuhan reported symptoms of patients suffering from unexplained low respiratory infections. It was initially declared as 'pneumonia of unknown etiology because of the limited information available about the cause of the disease. On January 12, 2020, WHO announced that infection in Wuhan belongs to coronaviruses, and on February 11, 2020, it was declared as COVID-19 (Cascella et al., 2020). COVID-19 comprises of 65 nm - 125nm in diameter and is a single-stranded RNA as nuclei material (Shereen et al., 2020). Moreover, WHO has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic due to its widespread transmission, a significant number of deaths, and higher infections and mortality rate as compared to previous coronaviruses outbreaks.",

In the USA, the first infected person has been reported in Washington state, and the lack of coordinated efforts at state and federal levels resulted in widespread outbreak with the USA having the most number of infected people and deaths (Dong et al., 2020). As of April 22, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control has reported 826,024 confirmed patients and 45, 365 deaths in the USA. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the federal government introduced precautionary measures such as public gatherings, travel restrictions, the mandatory 14-day quarantine period for suspected patients. The CDC has also directed American citizens to maintain social distancing and advised the general public to wear face masks and use personal protective equipment. Later on, observing looming crises, states across America declared mandatory lockdowns and enforced stricter rules to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (Piguillem and Shi, 2020). Although research teams are sparing no effort in finding the cure for COVID-19 to date, unfortunately, little or no success has been achieved, and \"social distancing\" is the only way to fight this novel disease (Shereen et al., 2020).",

Although COVID-19 will carry severe economic impact, the other side of the coin may lessen some of the COVID-19's unfortunate facts. As states are following social distancing and quarantine for more than a month, reduced human interference in the natural environment has given nature a \"healing time.\" One significant impact being observed is on air quality, which is being experienced by everyone and recorded in various official reports. Smog has given way to blue skies, there are increased activities in marine life, and pollution level in metropolitan cities has decreased significantly. These positive impacts have allowed us to reconsider our impact on the surroundings of us, and the situation today is a \"reset\" for nature and humans, giving us a prospect to observe and analyze the human impact over the environment (Parodi and Liu, 2020). Thus, we infer that quarantine measures have improved air quality in the USA; therefore, motivating us to examine the air quality and impact of environmental pollutants' association with COVID-19 in California.",

As a result, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has introduced health-based legislation, especially for elderly and children, to limit the pollutant emission in the state. Currently, the Environmental Pollution Agency considers emissions of PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, Sulfur oxide and Ozone as \"criteria\" pollutants to safeguard the environment. On the other hand, the CARB has introduced further environmental reforms to record emissions of Lead, Vinyl Chloride, Visibility Reducing Particles and Hydrogen Sulfide as four additional pollutants to protect the environment.",

Lead (Pb) has harmful bearings on the physiological conditions of humans and animals alike as exposure to lead results in weakness, anemia, brain, and kidney damage. Levin et al. (2020) explored the impact of Lead (Pb) and VOC (volatile organic compounds) over human health and the earth's atmosphere. They concluded that global warming is the key determinant of exacerbating Pb toxicity and implementing scientific and sustainable policies will contribute to protecting the environment. Sankhla et al. (2017) explored the impact of Pb, Zn, Cd, and Fe to conclude that human exposure to Lead and similar metals can result in cognitive and behavioural deficits and generate toxic effects on human organs, causing long-term health damage. Anyanwu et al. (2018) arrived at similar findings and stated that to achieve industrialization, developing countries set aside concerns about environmental safety and adopt state policies that contribute to pollution and contamination linked with Lead and volatile organic compounds.",

Reduction in economic activities, less road traffic, and statewide mandatory \"stay at home orders\" have contributed to lower environmental pollutant emissions. This study finds that PM2.5, PM 10, Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Sulfur dioxide are significantly correlated with COVID-19 cases in California, and limited human exposure to these pollutants will contribute to defeating COVID-19. Similarly, the significance of PM 2.5 and PM10 suggests that the adoption of green environmental policies should be further promoted as it would shield human life, especially children and the elderly as they are most vulnerable to the outbreak of infectious diseases. As our findings indicate that particulate matter (PM2.5, PM 10) are the major pollutants in California, therefore we suggest that policies about air quality assessment must include transportation of air masses from manufacturing areas. Also, future studies must assess the environmental impact of NO2, Ozone, and volatile organic compounds. Lastly, as meteorological conditions are of eminent standing, a comprehensive evaluation must be conducted to analyze its association with the outbreak of infectious diseases, i.e., COVID-19.",
