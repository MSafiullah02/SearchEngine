Each floor of the skilled nursing facility had a separate dining area, whereas residents of the health\u2010related facility ate in a single large dining hall. Medical care for residents was provided by three full\u2010time staff physicians. Infection control policies at the facility included quarantine of floors with \u22653 documented cases of influenza and amantadine prophylaxis for 2 weeks for residents of such floors. No specific isolation procedures were implemented for non\u2010influenza respiratory illnesses. No attempt was made to influence either individual patient care or existing infection control policy during this study.",

An institutionwide illness log was created and reviewed by a study nurse daily from Monday through Friday. Each subject listed in the illness log was then evaluated by a directed history and physical examination. A global severity of illness score was assigned by the study nurse, using an analog scoring system ranging from 0 to 10.\n3\n The analog score consisted of a horizontal line with one end representing mildest illness and the other end the most severely ill. This score represented the study nurses' overall assessment of the severity of an illness based on both the patient's symptoms and objective findings. In a separate analysis the analog scores were found to have a high correlation with objective indices of disease (Falsey, J Med Virol, in press). Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured percutaneously, and a nasopharyngeal swab for virus culture and serum were obtained on the initial visit. Chest roentgenograms were obtained and antimicrobials prescribed at the discretion of the patient's staff physician. Each patient was reevaluated daily for 3 days and convalescent sera obtained 4\u20138 weeks after the acute illness.",

First, infection control policies for RSV, rhinovirus, and PIV are different from those for influenza.
