            "text": "The ongoing outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is endangering individuals, governments and societies around the world. Indeed, this pandemic has unprecedented global consequences at the economic and social levels as it challenges the medical and research communities. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) [1] and, despite increasingly drastic efforts to contain the disease, the infection rapidly spread across the planet, leading the WHO to declare it, first, a global health emergency (in January 2020) and eventually a pandemic (on March 11, 2020) [2, 3] . As of April 30 th 2020, more than 200 countries and territories have reported COVID-19 cases with a total of over three million confirmed cases and more than 220.000 confirmed deaths [4] . In the current absence of effective treatments and vaccines, these numbers will continue to grow inexorably. The main clinical features of Given the devastating scenario that COVID-19 has already generated, a multitude of potential approaches against SARS-CoV-2 are currently being conceived. In that sense, we think that the manipulation of autophagy might be worth exploring. Macroautophagy (hereafter referring to autophagy) is an intracellular catabolic mechanism that regulates the elimination of unwanted, superfluous or defective cell components [17] . In this process, the targeted molecules/organelles are enclosed in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which eventually fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the delivered contents. This process is induced upon energy deprivation and/or physical activity in order to secure sufficient nutrient supply and is thus often referred to as a cellular self-digestion system. The compounds resulting from lysosomal degradation (e.g., fatty acids, amino acids) may be released into the cytoplasm for the generation of new macromolecules and/or bioenergetics reactions. Autophagy, therefore, represents a recycling mechanism under circumstances of low resource availability [17] .",

However, many viruses (including HIV-1 and HSV-1) and other pathogens have also evolved strategies to escape or inhibit autophagy and sometimes even to manipulate the autophagic machinery for their replicative benefit [33] . Thus, autophagy emerges as a crucial element in the evolutionary-driven arms race of host against pathogen. This further underlines the significance of xenophagy as a central antimicrobial mechanism, but also limits the potential of autophagy induction to fight infections.",

However, the existing data on other CoVs suggest that -despite some conflicting results -autophagy induction might be a valid approach that should be subjected to further evaluation. The autophagylysosomal system does indeed seem to play a central role during the infection with different CoVs, including SARS-CoVs [34] [35] [36] [37] . Nevertheless, the diverse putative roles of autophagy during viral infection [38] require that two opposite aspects be covered by this overview: (i) Is there evidence for autophagy being used for the survival or replication of CoVs (proviral effects)? (ii) Can autophagy induction reduce cellular infection, and does the virus actively inhibit autophagy (suggesting antiviral effects for autophagy)? Of note, cellular manipulation of autophagic levels during infection may also reflect desperate attempts of the cell to reestablish homeostasis, either through restriction of viral entry by actively shunting endocytosis/endosomal trafficking (possibly resulting in autophagy reduction as a sideeffect) [39] or to counteract virally induced cell death by increasing cytoprotective autophagy. As a third major as-OPEN ACCESS | www.microbialcell.com pect, (iii) the autophagic effects on antiviral immunity must be taken into consideration. Over the last 15 years, a number of studies have addressed these issues in the context of the \"old\" CoVs, those that historically precede SARS-CoV-2.",

As it may be at least partly the case for autophagosomes, DMVs probably depend on ER-derived membranes for their generation [40, 42] . Therefore, it was initially suspected that CoVs might usurp the autophagosomal machinery for DMV formation. In fact, an early study using ATG5 knockout cells implied that autophagy may promote mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication via formation of DMVs [43] . In a follow-up work, the same authors reported the co-localization of specific replication proteins (nsp2, nsp3, nsp8) with endogenous LC3, suggesting a connection between replication and autophagosome formation [44] . Other studies reported that the porcine CoVs transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [45] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [46] may induce autophagy to promote replication. However, the link between autophagy and replication of CoVs has been challenged by a number of different reports, showing that deletion of the essential autophagy genes ATG5 or ATG7 does not affect the replication of MHV [47, 48] or SARS-CoV [49] . Furthermore, the co-localization of LC3 (or GFP-LC3) with the SARS-CoV RNA replication complex could not be confirmed [50] . A study using pharmacological induction (rapamycin) or genetic inhibition (knockdown of LC3, ATG5, or ATG7) of autophagy even demonstrated that TGEV replication is negatively regulated by autophagy [51] . In addition, rapamycin reduced infectivity of PEDV [52] . Altogether, although some conflicting results exist, autophagy may not be primarily engaged in promoting CoV replication.",

Non-lipidated LC3, for instance, is used for membrane derivation for DMVs in CoVs, and downregulation of LC3 but not inactivation of autophagy, counteracts CoV infection [47] . Notably, some components of the canonical autophagy machinery can target invading pathogens by promoting phagosome-to-lysosome fusion [53] . During LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), for instance, which does not involve sequestration in autophagosomes, LC3 is recruited to phagosome membranes to facilitate lysosomal fusion and degradation [54] . In addition, it has been proposed that non-canonical autophagy and intruding viruses, both of which can be inhibited by the fungal compound brefeldin A, may converge in the retrieval of membranes [55] . Non-canonical autophagy includes ATG5-and ATG7-independent as well as Beclin-1independent autophagy [56, 57] . Altogether, these observations add further layers of possible modulation of autophagic processes in trying to attenuate viral infection (Figure 1 ).",

Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of these pathways was able to inhibit MERS-CoV infection [58] . Moreover, although one of the central replicase proteins (nsp6) of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) seems to promote autophagosome formation at the omegasome level [59] , nsp6 also limits further autophagosomal expansion [60] , thus compromising autophagic delivery of viral components to lysosomes.

A recent report corroborated the autophagy-inhibitory activity of MERS-CoV and showed that induction of autophagy can reduce MERS-CoV replication [37] . Specifically, the authors found that pharmacological inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase SKP2 increases the levels of Beclin-1, a central regulator of phagophore formation [37] . SKP2 executes lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of Beclin-1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, the inhibition of which promoted autophagy and efficiently reduced MERS-CoV replication. This work also shows that ectopic expression of at least three viral proteins (nsp6, p4b, p5) restricts autophagy [37] . While nsp6 may limit autophagosome expansion (see above), p4b inhibits RNAse L activation (a pro-autophagic event [63] ), and p5 has been connected to the blockage of IFN-\u03b2 induction [63, 64] , which itself may be linked to autophagy [65] . Accordingly, deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in reduced MERS-CoV growth, although disputing some previous observations, which the authors explain by methodological differences [37] . Thus, the group-specific accessory proteins, which by definition are not essential for viral replication but are involved in the modulation of host cells and immune evasion [66, 67] , may represent targets for reducing the autophagy-inhibitory effects of CoVs.",

            "text": "The FDA-approved anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been suggested to be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 [68] [69] [70] , but this remains widely controversial [71] [72] [73] . Although chloroquine is a lysosomotropic agent that blocks autophagic degradation, possibly by impairing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes [74] , the putative effects on autophagy may not be necessarily causal for the antiviral activity. In fact, endosomal acidification after endocytosis is critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry [75] , and chloroquine inhibits this acidification [76] . In addition, chloroquine limits terminal glycosylation of the metallopeptidase ACE2, the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [68, 75, 77] . Nonglycosylated ACE2 seems to interact less efficiently with OPEN ACCESS | www.microbialcell.com the SARS-CoV spike protein, thus reducing viral entry [78] . These modes of action would target the virus upstream of autophagy, making it unlikely that autophagy modulation contributes to the outcome of chloroquine treatment at that point. Additionally, chloroquine has been shown to induce autophagy-independent effects, for instance, Golgi disorganization [74] and pulmonary vasodilation [79] that may contribute to its controversial clinical activity. Interestingly, the net effects on autophagy may differ depending on parameters like cell type and dose: for instance, chloroquine-mediated lysosomal stress may promote the nuclear translocation of the pro-autophagic transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 [80, 81] . Altogether, further clinical work must clarify if chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major effects on COVID-19 and at which (early?) phase of the disease these drugs should be administered. If chloroquine or its derivative turned out to be clinically useful against COVID-19, it will be important to understand to which extent such effects are connected to the modulation of autophagy.",

In fact, the role of spermidine during infection may be pleiotropic. On the one hand, spermidine is an autophagy inducer [18, [87] [88] [89] [90] and may promote viral xenophagy; also, it may contribute to endosomal pH buffering [91] and thus block viral entry. On the other hand, polyamines are essential for viral replication [92] , and the overexpression of spermidine/spermine-N(1)acetyltransferase by the host, which drives spermidine (and spermine) depletion, is a common cellular response to viral infections, including that of RNA viruses [93] .

Amongst others, autophagy has been connected to the differentiation of CD8 + T-cells into cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to dendritic cell and B cell development, to plasma cell differentiation, and to macrophage differentiation, therefore covering multiple instances of the innate and adaptive immune systems [99] .

In the context of viral infections, this mechanism may be used to induce protective responses in cells neighboring an infection site [105, 106] . In primary human placental trophoblasts, for instance, autophagy induction promotes packaging and exosome-dependent delivery of specific miRNAs, which induce autophagy in non-placental recipient cells, conferring resistance to a variety of viruses [105] . This may be (one of) the mechanism(s) through which placental and maternal cells optimize their defense against viral infections during pregnancy.",

As mentioned above, the restriction of calorie intake is the most robust method to induce autophagy. However, the fight against acute infections also requires sufficient energy supply, suggesting that autophagy induction via caloric restriction or fasting regimens may be counterproductive, at least in the short-term during (as well as shortly before) infection. Therefore, caloric restriction mimetics [107, 108] , natural or synthetic compounds with the ability to induce autophagy, may circumvent this problem.",

Autophagy may counteract viral infection by executing and supporting different antiviral pathways in infected host cells as well as by promoting the function and survival of immune cells. Therefore, an increase in autophagic flux may be effective against coronaviruses (CoVs). Accordingly, CoVs may have developed strategies to limit cellular and organismal immunity by preventing autophagy.",
