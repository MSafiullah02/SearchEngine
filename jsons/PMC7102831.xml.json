HMs are commonly consumed in the form of raw materials, plant extracts (decoctions), and Chinese traditional patent medicines (CTPM) [4]. CTPM are standardized herbal formulations and often sold as over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to patients in community pharmacies for self-management [5]. At the same time, on the Essential Drugs List of China (2018) which is a key component of the China\u2019s healthcare reform, 268 of the 685 drugs were CTPM [6]. In the clinical setting, HMs may also be given as individualized traditional prescriptions containing raw materials prescribed by the TCM practitioners [7]. Under this \u201cone country, two (medical) systems\u201d healthcare setting whereby TCM is deeply rooted in the culture [1], the use of HMs continues to be embraced by the public and used frequently for both disease management and health maintenance.",

However, adverse drug reactions (ADR) associated with the use of HMs are not uncommon in China. Official statistics shows that in 2017, around 253,000 of the 1,571,000 ADR reports involved HMs administered as intravenous preparations (54.%) and oral preparations (39.4 %); among the 17,000 serious ADR reports associated with HMs, 59,000 cases involved elderly patients [10]. Similar safety concerns about HMs misuse associated with kidney and liver injury have been repeatedly reported [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Furthermore, HMs and conventional medicines are often prescribed together for the treatment of disease or used informally as part of a self-care practice [17]. Pharmacokinetic interactions that result in the inhibition or induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters raise safety concerns and may impact treatment outcomes [[18], [19], [20]]. In addition to potential interactions, the component complexity of HMs and uncertainties regarding their safety and efficacy raises a need for healthcare professionals to be involved in stewarding the judicious use of HMs.",

No exclusion criteria was defined a-priori, as potential participants were chosen strategically in order to obtain insight from a range of expert perspectives. These invitations were extended to all members within the expert pool who were asked to contact the research team for information about the study and interviews. Nine out of the 30 invited members agreed to participate in the study. Time constraints was the reason provided by those who were invited but unable to participate. An additional recruitment method of snowballing was employed to identify licensed pharmacists from across all sectors who had worked for a minimum of 6 months [31].",

Based on their feedback, interview questions were revised for clarity and prompts were added to guide the discussion in a standardized but not restrictive manner.",

However, there was some ambiguity about the definition of \u2018integrative medicine\u2019 within the context of pharmacy practice. In China, the term \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d or \u201cintegration of TCM and WM\u201d has been in use since the 1950\u2019s and refers to the integration of \u201cknowledge of Chinese medicine and Materia medica with the knowledge of western medicine and pharmacology, to create our unique new medicine and new pharmacology\u201d. [[37], [38], [39]] With the governments support, an integration of TCM into education, licensing, clinical practice, research and policy of medical practice has been observed [37,[39], [40], [41]]. However, such developments in integration do not appear to have extended to pharmacy professional practice. To date, there is no accepted definition of integrative medicine in pharmacy in China. To this end, participants in this study believed that establishing a stronger evidence-base for HMs efficacy and safety was a key to adopting two knowledge systems within one alternative medical approach [42].",

Once PPS are established, the pharmacist\u2019s extended role may be formalized, and they will be bound to seeking continuous learning opportunities and improving practice according to the informed standards. Although it was not discussed explicitly, the collective actions suggested by the key stakeholders confirmed the need for a joint effort to support pharmacists\u2019 practice in ensuring the safe use of HMs [28,67], and the process should be guided by a systematic methodology to yield high-quality evidenced instructive documents [32,68].",

            "text": "The discussion about pharmacists\u2019 role in the area of HMs and more broadly, raises concerns over the competence of the overall workforce. Within the community sector, there are two types of regulated pharmacists: Licensed Pharmacist and Licensed Pharmacist of Chinese Medicine. Although they are subject to prescribed obligations and responsibilities in the regulatory system and assessment process [32], they were often found ill-equipped to provide professional services [[70], [71], [72]]. The implications of this argument has been discussed in detail in previous studies [[33], [34], [35], [36]] What is relevant to the focus of this study was whether these pharmacists are positioned and supported to address the patients\u2019 needs in a coordinated manner. Ideally, a holistic approach that engages both types of pharmacists skillsets in patient care is encouraged [73,74]. However, the current regulation clearly defines their scope of practice in either HMs or conventional medicine depending on their specialty. More critically, their responsibilities, as currently defined in the SFDA regulations, do not include the duty to provide and maintain proper care for patients [75]. This is despite the fact that the healthcare reform plan highlighted the responsibilities of community pharmacies and pharmacists in providing primary healthcare [[76], [77], [78]].",

Training in both TCM and WM would allow pharmacists to play a role in both HMs and conventional medicines, promote a more collaborative relationship with other health-care disciplines and assume greater responsibility in prospering a well-defined model of integrative medicine [80,81] This further highlights the need for pharmacists to engage in continuous learning to develop their competence and professional role in the pharmacy.

TCM is not the only traditional medicine practiced in China, and other ethnic minority medicine may also be used even more frequently than TCM in some parts of China. Even though saturation was achieved, the opinions and comments provided by the limited number of participants in this study might only refer to areas where pharmacists\u2019 role is more developed. In addition, the inclusion of up to 2 representatives from the key stakeholder categories may not be able to provide the full capacity to reflect on the complete view about the interview questions to the groups they are representing, warranting wider sampling in future studies. Furthermore, due to constraints of this study, the perspectives of patients and consumers were not included. Nevertheless, the qualitative approach met the objectives of collecting rich, in-depth information about the dilemma pharmacists in China are currently facing with regards to HMs. The findings can serve to inform policy makers, professional organizations and research institutes about the relevance of HMs when deciding pharmacist\u2019s legal role, ethical and professional responsibilities, and practice standards in relation to TCM. Subsequent studies are planned that will focus on the general public including patients and consumers of HM to gain an understanding of the expectations for pharmacists in the area of HMs.",

Despite their prominence, key stakeholders report that there are gaps in pharmacists knowledge and therefore professional capacity to provide comprehensive pharmaceutical care that facilitates the safe use of both HMs and conventional medicines. Guiding principles that outline standards for such use in an integrated healthcare system are required. Such standards would serve as a baseline for professional expectations within existing practice, and serve as a framework for teaching institutions to model pharmacy education for undergraduate and continuing professional development programs. Given the pharmacy profession is largely policy-driven in China, the governing authorities are encouraged to take this opportunity to initiate future work in developing practice standards and foster collaborations between key stakeholders including research institutes, universities, pharmaceutical organizations and other healthcare stakeholders to build capacity in this area that ultimately addresses the needs of the public who use HMs.",
