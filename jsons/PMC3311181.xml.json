The aspirate was not tested for bacteria. Cultures of blood collected on the day of admission, before antimicrobial drug treatment was started, were negative. A second chest radiograph showed partial atelectasis of the left upper lung lobe, a retrocardial infiltrate, and pneumomediastinum. On hospitalization day 5, oxygen saturation could be maintained at a lower flow rate. On day 6, chest radiograph showed regression of atelectasis in both lobes and of the pneumomediastinum. Temperature dropped to subfebrile levels, and the child\u2019s general condition was improving. On day 9, no additional oxygen was needed. On day 10, chest radiograph showed residual atelectasis in both upper lobes and residual infiltrates in both lungs, and the patient was discharged. Two weeks later, at follow-up examination, the child was doing well, breath sounds were unremarkable, and the pathologic radiographic findings had resolved completely.",

Studies have detected HBoV in 9% and 19.3% of all samples, indicating that it is the second or third most commonly detected virus, after RSV and rhinovirus (2,10). Thus, the overall contribution of HBoV to all detected respiratory viruses lies well below that of RSV. High prevalence does not necessarily mean high clinical relevance, and proving its causative role has been difficult because the virus is often detected along with other viruses; co-detection rates are as high as 75% (11,12).",

HBoV is the most probable cause of respiratory tract disease if the patient has a high viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates accompanied by viremia, if HBoV is the only pathogen detected, and if an acute primary HBoV infection is diagnosed by serologic testing (5,11,13). We detected HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirate and serum. The serologic results strongly suggest that this child had an acute primary HBoV infection. The serologic assay developed earlier was validated in a series of studies and shown to reliably measure serologic response against HBoV (5\u20138). Inflammatory markers were not elevated, thereby indicating no bacterial infection. However, the contribution of bacteria to the course of the disease cannot be completely ruled out.",

Similarly, another case report described HBoV infection that resulted in pneumomediastinum (15). The age of the patient reported here is also typical of HBoV, which mostly infects children 6 months to 3 years of age, but it does not usually infect young infants, as RSV does (14).
