A very narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition was observed in the serum from individuals who later contracted H1N1 infection. Moreover, the pandemic influenza infection generated IgG reactivity to two adjacent epitopes of the neuraminidase protein. The differential serum IgG recognition was focused on haemagglutinin 1 (H1) and restricted to classical antigenic sites (Cb) in both the vaccinated controls and individuals with flu infections. We further identified a novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL on the Ca antigenic site (251-265) of the pandemic flu haemagglutinin, which was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals with previous vaccinations and never in serum from individuals with H1N1 infection (confirmed by RNA PCR analysis from nasal swabs).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "The influenza pandemic 2009, caused by novel triple reassorted swine origin influenza A virus H1N1, was first identified in the USA. [1] [2] [3] [4] The European Centre for Disease Control estimated that 1975 laboratory confirmed death cases were reported all over Europe in the first year. 5 The seasonal influenza vaccines, either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, exhibited no protective effect as measured by a haemagglutinin (HA) inhibition assay in young adults and children, although individuals born before 1950 showed protective serum IgG titres. 3, 6, 7 The lack of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against the pandemic influenza virus increased the susceptibility in the general population. 8 Only 31% of B-cell epitopes were conserved in the pandemic (swine-origin influenza virus) strain compared with the seasonal variant flu strains; moreover, of the eight conserved epitopes, only a single epitope was from HA. 9 The HA ectodomain is a homotrimeric complex with four distinct antigenic sites with two polypeptide chains HA1 and HA2. Each homotrimer is comprised of a large globular head that binds to glycan receptors and a distal stem region. 10, 11 Haemagglutinin is the target of neutralizing antibodies in the context of pandemic influenza 2009 12 and often described as the immunogenicity-defining surface protein of influenza viruses. 11, 13, 14 Therefore, we mapped in this study the serum IgG epitope recognition profiles after a natural pandemic flu infection and Pandemrix \u00e2 vaccination using a high content influenza peptide microarray. 15, 16 Serum antibody-based protein target identification (SEREX) has been used to successfully identify a number of biologically relevant targets in cancer [17] [18] [19] [20] and to show differences in the epitope recognition pattern in the course of HIV infection versus (gp120) HIV vaccination. 21 We choose a similar approach to define the epitope recognition pattern in serum using synthetic linear peptide stretches to define (i) the immune recognition pattern to segregate individuals at high risk of infection with influenza virus, (ii) differences in IgG recognition patterns induced by vaccination versus infection, and (iii) shared epitope recognition patterns comparing different HA proteins from influenza A strains, including the HA from the pandemic strain influenza A virus [A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1)]. Up to now, immunological differences between time-points (e.g. before/after flu vaccination) or between different patient groups were assayed by ELISA. 22 Using this method, only increase in titres or reactivity to different targets could be measured. However, recognition of recombinant proteins in ELISA usually represents recognition of 20-40 different epitopes (linear and conformational).

One salient finding is the pre-existing serum IgG to pandemic HA in vaccinated individuals before the onset of the flu season, probably due to past exposures and previous vaccinations (the interviews of the study participants showed that individuals who chose to be vaccinated did so previously, before 2009/2010 and vice versa. 27 ) Not only pre-existing serum IgG, resulting from previous flu vaccinations, but also pre-existing protective antibodies from past exposures to H1 strains 37-40 may contribute to this humoral response. A broader pandemic flu epitope recognition pattern is reflected in 10 shared pandemic influenza epitopes in serum from individuals before the flu season onset, as well as in seven epitopes from pandemic flu internal proteins in serum from individuals who chose to be vaccinated. The biological role of these antibodies, directed to internal proteins, is not clear. Previous reports suggested that non-neutralizing antibodies may decrease morbidity and lead to increased viral clearance through binding to Fc receptors and subsequently to CD8 cells. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Conserved influenza internal proteins may therefore help to elicit memory B cells that are longlived 46,47 and contribute to heterosubtypic immunity during antigenic drifts. Cross-protection can be induced by antibodies against the generic N1 that are reactive against the pandemic N1, as described previously for N2 subtypes. 48, 49 Moreover, in the absence of neutralizing HA antibodies, neuraminidase-specific antibodies would be instrumental to mount protective immune responses against the pandemic virus. 49 Of note, we observed in serum from the current cohort an increase in neuraminidase epitope reactivity, but no pandemic H1 epitopes were commonly recognized. This could be related to the fact that we tested reactivity only against linear epitopes, which is a caveat of the chip design used in the current study, and biologically relevant conformational epitopes may have been missed. 23, 24 Antibodies against swine influenza virus were found to neutralize pandemic flu in experimental models. 50, 51 However non-neutralizing antibodies produced against the swine origin H1due to past exposurescould enhance virus fusion and promote infection. 52 Most significantly, the subjects in the current study who experienced H1N1 infection (confirmed with a positive PCR), exhibited increased levels of IgG against SRYSKKFK-PEIAARP from the HA [Influenza A virus (A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00 (H1N2))], which is highly homologous to the SRYSKKFKPEIAIRP epitope from HA [Influenza A virus (A/California/08/2009(H1N1))] on the HA receptor binding domain.

Note that the epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL (from the pandemic flu) was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals both before and after Pandemrix \u00e2 vaccination, yet never in serum from individuals who experienced later H1N1 infection. A rabbit mono-specific antibody directed against this epitope was prepared that did not neutralize the pandemic flu in vitro; functional significance of this epitope could not be established. A possible explanation is that a 15mer linear peptide that was used to immunize the rabbits does not resemble the same folding of this epitope within the native protein. However, the antibodies detected in serum from vaccinated individuals against this epitope may activate complement and subsequently contribute to virus neutralization in a biological system. 56, 57 This test was beyond the scope of the study, since epitope-specific complement-activating human reagents were not available. Future experiments will also need to address whether high-avidity antibodies from flu-protected individuals 58, 59 can be identified with the peptide microarray assay and whether the target epitopes could be used for guided vaccine development. Although the current study may be limited because only IgG directed against linear epitopes could be characterized with conformational epitopes being missed, a distinct IgG recognition pattern was identified. These patterns segregated based on H1N1 infection and vaccination and could be clearly linked to a clinically relevant endpoint: flu infection leads to a different array of epitope recognition compared with the flu vaccine. Immune profiling of individuals, protected from infectious pathogens, may help to tailor new vaccine candidates and help to identify clinically relevant markers of immune protection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1383, "end": 1386, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1389, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1626, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1629, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article: Table S1 .
