            "text": "Social dilemmas are frequent, relevant, and characterized by that cooperation leads to better outcomes across people, but so long as others cooperate, each individual is better off by defecting (Dawes, 1980). To illustrate, many (in)voluntary teams (e.g., developing the Tesla Cybertruck, a vaccine against COVID-19 etc.) would succeed to a higher degree if everyone put in their best work, but each free rider gains a share of whatever degree of team success and, at the same time, has ample time to pursue other gains (e.g., assets, fun etc.). Game theory predicts that individuals defect to preclude higher losses than gains and gaining less than others. However, individuals cooperate to some degree in the lab and everyday life (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013), even in one-time, fully anonymous encounters (Dal B\u00f3 & Fr\u00e9chette, 2018; Dorrough & Gl\u00f6ckner, 2016) that preclude immediate reward and punishment by others. Given the central role of this cooperative success in the evolution of human societies (Hardin, 1968, Henrich, 2004; Richerson et al., 2016), researching explanations of cooperation in social dilemmas remains a topic of great scientific interest.",

There are many reasons for this. Perceived similarity signals some degree of kinship (Park & Schaller, 2005), trustworthiness (Koch et al., 2020), likability (Alves et al., 2017, Alves et al., 2018), and opportunity to form a group (Hehman, Flake, & Freeman, 2018). It increases likelihood of re-encounter (i.e., birds of a feather flock together; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001) and thereby reciprocity as well as reward and punishment by previously met individuals and their social network (Yamagishi, Jin, & Kiyonari, 1999). As perceived kinship, trustworthiness, and likability, sharing group membership, reciprocity, reward, and punishment all explain cooperation in social dilemmas (Rand & Nowak, 2013), it is almost necessary that perceived similarity does as well.",

First, individuals divide their environment/society into which types of people (Kawakami, Amodio, & Hugenberg, 2017)? And second, individuals perceive these social identities as similar on which dimensions (Pattyn, Rosseel, & Van Hiel, 2013)? For the U.S., we (Koch, Imhoff, Dotsch, Unkelbach, & Alves, 2016) answered these two questions with theoretically impartial, mostly data-driven research. A first sample of U.S. residents spontaneously listed up to 30 groups (\u201cOff the top of your head, what various types of people do you think today's society categorizes into groups?\u201d). To other U.S.-citizens we presented in the center of a blank screen the most frequently listed groups (\u201cBlacks\u201d, \u201cWhites\u201d, \u201cpoor people\u201d, \u201cmiddle class\u201d, \u201crich people\u201d, \u201cHispanics\u201d, \u201cAsians\u201d, \u201cDemocrats\u201d, \u201cRepublicans\u201d etc.). We tasked the latter individuals to drag and drop the groups back and forth on the screen, placing subjectively similar groups close together and subjectively dissimilar groups far apart (i.e., at opposite ends of the screen). We gave no other instructions, and thus individuals were free to place at opposite ends of the screen groups they perceived as dissimilar in morality, ability, or any other dimension (Abele, Ellemers, Fiske, Koch, & Yzerbyt, 2020).",

U.S. residents who perceived others as more similar to the self in agency perceived them as higher in communion (a.k.a. trustworthiness and likability; Koch et al., 2016), and perceived communion of others also increased with perceived other-self similarity in beliefs (Koch et al., 2018; Koch, Imhoff, et al., 2020). Perceived communion co-explains the effect of perceived similarity on cooperation (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013).

In Model 3.1 in Table OSM.2, R\n2 = 7.9%, 95% CI = [7.2%, 8.7%], we added the mediator player-scored communion of coplayer group.

Taken together, perceived communion of a group, expectation that its members will cooperate, or correlates of these might mediate the independent effects of perceived self-group similarity in agency and beliefs on behavioral cooperation with this group (here: transferring money). As we manipulated neither IVs nor mediators, however, such statistical mediation is necessary but not sufficient to show actual mediation (Fiedler, Harris, & Schott, 2018).",

In this sense, establishing ecological validity is not complete yet. Towards establishing external validity, future research could aim to generalize our cooperation effects to other relevant behaviors such as fair distribution and generous donation (Jenkins, Karashchuk, Zhu, & Hsu, 2018). Future research should further examine internal validity (i.e., causation) by manipulating rather than, as here, measuring perceived other-self similarity in agency and beliefs. Further, agency and beliefs as defined in the ABC model of stereotypes (Koch et al., 2016; Koch, Imhoff, et al., 2020) are purposefully broad stereotype dimensions. Still, future research could investigate whether perceived self-group similarity in some compared to other facets of agency (power, status, dominance, wealth, confidence, and competitiveness) and beliefs (tradition, religion, convention, and conservatism vs. modernism, orientation to science, alternativity, and liberalism) better predict cooperation and other socially relevant behaviors. Finally, it could be that self-group similarity on dimensions other than agency and beliefs also and better predict cooperation across groups (Abele et al., 2020; Fiske, 2018).",
