In response to SARS, pandemic influenza and Ebola, the British state adopted a voluntaristic and holistic approach; it encouraged the public to voluntarily follow its public health policies and considered the social and economic impact of outbreaks. American public health officials developed a narrower medical-legal approach to outbreaks that relied almost exclusively on a finding a biomedical solution and utilizing coercive legal authority to regulate citizens\u2019 behavior. In particular, the two countries have adopted divergent border control and quarantine policies; Britain has not tried to compulsorily isolate the sick or restrict their entry into the country, while the United States has set up and used the legal framework to do just that.",

I argue that we can understand their divergent responses by taking an historical approach. Britain\u2019s system of disease control, formed in the early part of the nineteenth century, was influenced by the theory of miasma and was originally located in the welfare sector of the state. In the United States disease control, developed late in the nineteenth century, was influenced instead by germ theory and was historically part of the military. By the twentieth century, these initial differences congealed into distinct styles of disease control. I argue that the distinct responses of the British and American states to EIDs in the twenty-first century are the most recent iterations of styles of disease control that each country has been developing since at least the nineteenth century.",

Likewise, officials declared that closing the border would be largely ineffective against pandemic influenza. Modeling suggested that even if it was 99.9 per cent effective, such actions would only delay an epidemic by 2 months (HPA, 2007; Department of Health (DH), 2011). British policies changed slightly in response to the outbreak of Ebola. While Britain has not denied entry to passengers traveling from West Africa, starting in October 2014 it began to screen air passengers. Health officials checked the temperatures and asked passengers from West Africa to fill out health reports (Gov.uk, 2015).",

The model act allows a state to forcibly quarantine entire groups of people and it is possible for an individual person to be isolated for up to 10 days without a court hearing. As of 2006, 38 states have passed versions of the act, some with very strict quarantine laws.

In terms of border controls, the government never used a positive HIV status as a reason to deny either entry into Britain or the ability to immigrate (Baldwin, 2005). Instead, as was the case in 1918, public education became the main focus of the response to AIDS. By 1986 there were television and radio announcements about the disease and in 1987 health officials created a national \u2018AIDS week\u2019 and an informational leaflet about AIDS was mailed to 23 million homes in Britain. Officials also adopted a holistic response to the crisis: counselors were provided to deal with the psychological effect of becoming HIV positive; officials considered how HIV might affect the blood supply; and economists performed an economic cost-benefit analysis of prevention versus treatment of AIDS (Berridge, 1996).",

Described as the \u2018bacteriological revolution\u2019 (a revolution that Worboys (2006) argues never occurred in Britain), US public health officials began to lose interest in sanitation and instead focused on controlling the infectious bodies of the sick (Humphreys, 1999; Duffy, 1990). In the early part of the twentieth century this style of disease control was given the name \u2018New Public Health\u2019 (to distinguish it from the earlier sanitary focused approach). Writings by public health leaders (see Chaplin, 1910; Hill, 1916; MacNutt, 1915) focused on eliminating germs and controlling the bodies of the sick who carried them. MacNutt (1915, p. 91) wrote \u2018Human conduct is the great factor in public health, and also the most difficult to control\u2019.",

Some public policy analysts now believe that nation states are converging on one international standard of disease control. This perspective claims that as we now live in a \u2018post-Westphalian\u2019 world of infectious disease, a unified global response is required. Yet, a potential barrier to this convergence is the historically distinct systems of disease control that nation states have built up over time.",

That is, once a style of disease control is developed it tends to become institutionalised and carried into the future policy actions of the state. This means that as states have had different histories of dealing with disease in the past, they continue to practice distinct styles of disease control in the present. These public policy differences, produced by the distinct and historically durable systems of disease control that nations have built up over long periods of time, represent a challenge to the adoption of a truly coordinated and unified international response to infectious disease.",
