DISCUSSION: There is potential for PI technologies to reduce infectious RBC risk and to provide additional benefits (e.g., prevention of transfusion-associated graftversus-host disease and possible reduction of alloimmunization) due to white blood cell inactivation. PI-RBCs should be viewed in the context of having a fully PI-treated blood supply, enabling a blood safety paradigm shift from reactive to proactive. Providing insurance against new EIAs.

In a recent risk/benefit publication on PI platelets (PLTs) prepared using the Intercept system, 1 we emphasized that such an analysis should calculate benefits and risks on a per-patient rather than a per-unit basis. However, because this is a more difficult task for RBCs, we used a combined approach of calculating a risk per RBC unit and, when possible, a per-patient risk. Since the availability of PI-RBCs would result in the potential to transfuse a full complement of PI blood components (RBC, PLTs, plasma), we also discuss operational benefits that could be achieved under a full PI scenario.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 417, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of per-unit"}, {"text": "The 2011 HHS National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey estimated a mean per-patient RBC dose of 2.75 units annually, 2 and a 5-year retrospective study in a regional hospital system reported a mean of 2.9 (62.7) RBC units per transfused inpatient. 3 However, there is substantial interpatient variability in RBC units transfused due to clinical diagnoses of the patient, the indication for transfusion, long established physician practice patterns, and the presence or absence of patient blood management programs. Figure 1 provides a theoretical schema for understanding a recipient's risk of acquiring a transfusion-transmitted infection, which is dependent on two factors: the number of units transfused (e.g., a higher risk with more units) and whether transfusion occurs when an undetected emerging infectious agent (EIA) is in the blood supply. This latter time-related risk is higher for recipients whose transfusion exposure spans a longer time interval. 1, 4 Factors relevant to clinical outcome of a transfusion-transmitted infection include the expected length of recipient survival due to underlying disease and the increased susceptibility of different patient populations (based on their degree of immunosuppression) to adverse clinical outcomes secondary to infectious disease transmission. 5 Thus, a logical way to categorize RBC recipients is both by number of units transfused and by the time interval over which transfusions occur.

B. microti was the agent in 159 cases while three involved B. duncani. All but four cases were from RBC units with transmission occurring throughout the storage period. Almost 80% were reported from 1999 to 2009; whether this represents increased transfusion transmission or lack of recognition of past cases or both is not known. Although nearly 90% of cases were in the seven highly endemic states, cases also occurred in nonendemic states. 20, 22 These were attributed to shipment of RBC units from an endemic to a nonendemic area, a donor from an endemic area donating while visiting a nonendemic area, or a nonendemic area donor having acquired the infection while visiting an endemic area. In the absence of additional interventions, known per-unit infectious risks are consistent over time. These risks change when an EIA enters the blood supply. The figure indicates two types of EIAs: an acute agent and a chronic agent.* A past example of an acute EIA is West Nile virus and a past example of a chronic EIA is HIV. In contrast to known agents, EIA risks will vary over time. The intervals between an acute or chronic EIA entering the blood supply and the application of a successful intervention for that agent have been estimated as 1.5 and 5 years, respectively. After recognition of the EIA and development of a screening test, the risk from that agent will be decreased but a small residual risk will remain, thereby slightly increasing the overall per-unit risk above the previous level. This is indicated (though not to scale) by the stepwise increase in the horizontal line. *An acute agent is present only transiently (usually days to weeks) until the donor resolves the viremia or parasitemia.

Recently, B. microti donor screening using serologic (automated immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and nucleic acid test (NAT) assays under an investigational new drug procedure has been ongoing on a portion of the inventory in several states. [24] [25] [26] [27] Seroprevalence in these states ranged between 0.4 and 1.2% (17% being polymerase chain reaction [PCR] positive) and 1 in 10,000 donors showed PCR positivity without antibody. 27 Although PCR positivity increases the risk of transfusion transmission, PCR-negative but seropositive units may also transmit; furthermore low-level parasitemia or infectivity may be intermittent over a period of months to a year.

Further, since Babesia infection is regional, a blood center's impetus to screen donations upon FDA licensure is likely to vary. In nonendemic areas, reluctance may be due to concerns about adding unnecessary cost for little safety gain and the loss of donors due to false-positive test results. 30 Finally, there is no legal or ethical precedent or model for regional screening of the US blood supply.

[68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] Gamma irradiation is known to damage RBC membranes causing acute and delayed hemolysis and to damage the Na-K pump resulting in potassium leakage from the RBCs. 75 Consequently, storage of irradiated RBCs is limited to 28 days postirradiation. 76 In the United States in 2011, an estimated 13.4% of transfused RBCs were irradiated. 2 It is likely that the criteria for irradiation varied among institutions. Similarly, the length of time that an irradiated RBC unit is stored before being transfused may also vary. In the scenario of batch mode irradiation with subsequent storage of units, there is the theoretical concern that these RBC units may function less optimally than nonirradiated RBCs and therefore should not be given to patients not at risk of TA-GVHD. The alternative scenario of irradiating units just before product issue poses logistic challenges and is only possible if the institution has its own blood irradiator. Finally, facilities with irradiators have been subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny due to bioterrorism concerns, making the continued use of this equipment less desirable and more expensive. 76 PI-RBCs and PI-WB procedures have been found effective in inactivating white blood cells (WBCs) and T cells and when applied routinely, could replace the use of gamma irradiation, and solve logistic challenges. 77, 78 Data for one of these technologies indicate that PI-RBCs show lower hemolysis, lack of effect on the Na-K pump, and lower extracellular potassium and protein levels, resulting in better in vitro function than gamma-irradiated RBCs. 79 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 173, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 305, "end": 307, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 571, "end": 575, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 752, "end": 754, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 835, "end": 837, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 923, "end": 924, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1725, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1940, "text": "77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1943, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2178, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Noninfectious risks"}, {"text": "Since PI is known to prevent donor WBCs from exerting their immunologic effects, PI could theoretically affect the immune system's presentation of RBC antigens and thereby influence RBC alloimmunization rates; therefore, the impact of LR on RBC alloimmunization may help predict whether PI treatment of RBC would have a similar effect. [80] [81] [82] The development of RBC alloantibodies has wellknown potential deleterious consequences. The rate of RBC alloimmunization in transfused hospitalized patients (excluding patients with hemoglobinopathies) has been measured at 1.8% and 4% in two large studies. 83, 84 The rate increases with the number of RBC units transfused; however, the majority of antibodies are formed early in the course of transfusion therapy. Specific primary diagnoses are associated with higher rates: 18% to 47% in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in the absence of phenotypic matching, 85 5% to 30% in thalassemia, 17,86-89 15% in MDS, 90 and 9% in patients with malignant hematology diagnoses. 91 A prospective small randomized control trial in 404 cardiac surgery patients examined the effect of universal LR on RBC alloimmunization. 92 Although the rate was lower in the LR group than in the non-LR group (3.4% vs. 7.1%), the difference was not significant. A smaller singlehospital study using a retrospective noncontemporaneous study design demonstrated a decreased alloimmunization rate in recipients of LR versus non-LR RBCs based on comparing data from two 1-year intervals separated by 14 years. 93 This same study showed that LR resulted in a decreased alloimmunization rate in acute myeloid leukemia patients whereas a different study showed no effect of LR in MDS patients. 90 Other smaller studies in thalassemia patients have suggested an association of LR with a decreased RBC alloimmunization rate; 94 however, these studies have had small sample sizes and have potential confounding factors. In summary, the available data do not allow for a firm conclusion. Unlike LR (which still leaves a small number of viable WBCs in the blood product), 80,81 PI renders WBCs nonviable and stops protein production and antigen expression, thus establishing a theoretical basis for why PI might reduce alloimmunization even if LR does not. 95, 96 Patients with leukemia usually receive both RBC and PLT transfusions. Current data suggest that PI treatment of PLTs may reduce the rate of HLA alloimmunization in this patient group. 96 It is possible that PI-RBCs may show the same benefit. If so, the application of PI to both components may protect against HLA alloimmunization and may improve the odds of finding a compatible HSCT donor for patients with leukemia as well as for patients with hemoglobinopathies who may become future HSCT candidates. 97, 98 These possibilities need to be examined in the clinic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 346, "end": 350, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 608, "end": 611, "text": "83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 612, "end": 614, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 965, "end": 967, "text": "90", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1026, "text": "91", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1167, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1536, "text": "93", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1717, "text": "90", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1846, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2273, "end": 2276, "text": "95,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2277, "end": 2279, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2466, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2788, "text": "97,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2791, "text": "98", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RBC alloimmunization"}, {"text": "It is important for PI clinical trial protocols to include an assessment of RBC alloimmunization rates.

WB can be separated into components and then PI can be applied to the RBCs, or PI treatment can be applied to the WB unit. The PI-WB unit can be transfused as WB or, alternatively, could subsequently undergo further processing to produce components; 99 the latter approach has the logistic advantage of producing multiple PI components from a single PI application. However, if the WB unit is stored before processing, this approach may require compromises since component storage requirements are conflicting and will be difficult to satisfy simultaneously (e.g., RBCs and WB are stored refrigerated, PLTs at RT, and plasma frozen). In developed countries, targeted blood component therapy for specific indications has been standard practice for many decades. Specialized storage containers have been tailored to each component and additive solutions developed to optimize quality and extend shelf life. 100 Furthermore, individual-component PI technology is compatible with apheresis component collection, which has become an important part of the blood supply chain. 101 In contrast, in countries with little infrastructure or in acute trauma situations (particularly in military conflicts), the need for WB transfusion is greater and suggests the value of the application of PI to WB units. 102, 103 Two methods are in commercial development for supplying PI-RBC products: WB photochemical inactivation using riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light (Mirasol System) 104 and RBC chemical inactivation using S-303 and glutathione (GSH; Intercept System). 105 In addition, use of the S-303 and GSH system to treat WB is being pursued for the developing world. 106 The basic characteristics of the two systems are summarized in Fig. 4 . The riboflavin and UV WB system utilizes the same riboflavin dose and illuminator as for plasma and PLT PI, but uses a much higher UV dose, corresponding to a significantly longer illumination time (Fig. 4) . 104 The S-303 and GSH system, now in its second generation, utilizes a chemical system featuring a fast-acting compound (S-303) that reacts with nucleic acid bases to form stable adducts and cross-links with a mode of action similar to the Intercept systems for PLTs and plasma, but without the use of an illuminator. 105 To minimize nonspecific reactions with molecules in the extracellular domain, GSH is included in the process. Because of its size, GSH does not penetrate cell or viral membranes, so when added to the RBC unit, it remains exclusively in the extracellular space. This allows quenching of extracellular reactions without a significant impact on pathogen and WBC inactivation. The modifications present in the secondgeneration system were implemented to reduce the formation of immunogenic adducts on the surface of PI-RBCs. [107] [108] [109] The second-generation system uses the same dose of the active ingredient S-303, a buffered version of the quencher GSH at 10-fold higher concentration for improved quenching, and includes an exchange step after the overnight incubation that allows the effective removal of proteins and electrolytes from the RBC supernatant. 109, 110 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 973, "end": 976, "text": "100", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "101", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "text": "102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1371, "text": "103", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1626, "text": "105", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1730, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2015, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2333, "text": "105", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2860, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2866, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2872, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 3198, "end": 3202, "text": "109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 3203, "end": 3206, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 57, "end": 65, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1794, "end": 1800, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2009, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "APPROACHES FOR PRODUCING A PI-RBC PRODUCT"}, {"text": "Licensure of PI-RBCs or PI-WB requires in vitro studies of RBC quality during storage, in vitro inactivation studies for representative transfusion-transmitted pathogens, in vivo recovery and survival studies of transfused RBCs in healthy volunteers to validate the maximum allowable length of product storage, and clinical trials of safety and efficacy in relevant patient populations.

For the S-303 and GSH system, the extent of PI has remained comparable between the first-and second-generation approaches. For the riboflavin and UV system, the limited data indicate that inactivation of some pathogens is lower in the WB system than in the PLT and plasma systems, despite the higher dose of UV light used (80 J/mL RBC vs. 6.2 J/mL PLASMA ). This is consistent with the lower efficiency for UV light delivery in the presence of hemoglobin (Hb)-containing RBCs. 99 Each technology has undergone recovery and survival studies independently performed by the same investigator (Table 8) . 122, 123 The S-303 and GSH system was tested in 27 healthy volunteers in two centers using a crossover design. 122 At 35 days of storage, the 24-hour recovery of autologous treated RBCs compared favorably with control RBCs (88% vs. 90%, p 5 0.31), meeting FDA requirements.
