Additionally, investigation of pathogen\u2010induced alterations in the host proteome under diseased conditions can provide valuable information regarding disease pathogenesis and host immune responses 8. In order to sustain viability within the host system and ensure their replication, pathogens develop versatile mechanisms to exploit their host's cells and to induce new permeability pathways to allow the uptake of nutrients and the removal of waste products 9. This significantly affects various vital physiological processes and, as a consequence, modulates the host's proteome. Upon infection, a continuous interaction between the pathogen and the host immune system initiates a complex immune response to hold back the pathogenic infection and growth through multiple antiparasitic effector functions, including inhibition of invasion and cytoadherence, antibody\u2010dependent cytotoxicity, and cellular inhibition.",

Large numbers of serum/plasma proteomics studies aimed at the identification of novel potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers or understanding disease pathobiology have been reported during the past decade 3. However, altered expression levels of potential biomarkers have often been found to be nonspecific and are altered in multiple infectious diseases, irrespective of the type of infection. This might be an effect of inflammation\u2010mediated acute phase response signaling 12. Our research group is investigating the alterations in the human serum proteome in different infectious diseases, including falciparum and vivax malaria 13, 14, dengue fever 15, and leptospirosis 16, to identify the common and unique protein signatures. Moreover, we have compiled a list of differentially expressed serum proteins in ten different types of protozoan, viral, and bacterial infectious diseases that are often fatal, including malaria, dengue, meningitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), diarrheas, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and leptospirosis, from over 200 published studies conducted using proteomics and immunoassay\u2010based approaches.

Biomarkers are indicator biomolecules that assist in early diagnosis, discriminate between different diseases, and provide valuable tools for monitoring the progression/severity of disease. Early detection of infectious diseases could reduce the complications of secondary infections, fatalities due to disease severity, and also the unnecessary costs of improper and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although existing diagnostic approaches (including analysis of clinical symptoms, microscopic detection of the causative pathogenic organism, molecular and immunologic diagnostic methods, and rapid diagnostic tests), which are usually implemented clinically, are adequately robust and sensitive for detection of the pathogen in symptomatic patients, the sensitivity is lower in asymptomatic subjects or in patients at a very early stage of infection (Table 1). Furthermore, existing routine detection techniques are unable to provide any prognostic information regarding the infection, or to clearly discriminate among infections that have overlapping clinical manifestations. To this end, protein markers are potential candidates for the development of alternative more\u2010sensitive diagnostic and prognostic approaches for infectious diseases. Identification of a panel of biomarkers might be attractive for detection of specific infections, as well as for discrimination among nearly similar identical manifestations.",

Plasma is more easily separable from the cellular components of the blood and a slightly higher volume (10\u201315%) of plasma is generally obtained from an equal quantity of whole blood compared to serum. Furthermore, a plasma sample can be obtained quickly since no coagulation time is required and coagulation\u2010induced interferences/variations can be avoided. In contrast, due to the absence of fibrinogen and other blood clotting factors in serum, the total protein content and complexity is reduced compared to plasma. According to a recent study by Zimmerman et al. involving paired comparison of plasma and serum samples from the same individuals, there were negligible differences in the numbers of peptide and protein identifications or in the overall percentages of semitryptic peptides or methionine oxidized peptides between these two biological fluids, although higher variability of semitryptic peptides were observed in serum 17. In particular, the variations in serum samples are introduced due to the inconsistency in the coagulation and separation processes. A comparative analysis of human serum and EDTA, heparin, and citrate\u2010anticoagulated plasma conducted by Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) clearly indicated that plasma with EDTA (or citrate) anticoagulant provides more reproducible results than serum, and therefore plasma has been recommended as a more attractive biological fluid for proteomics research 18.",

Experimental details (e.g., sample type, population size, type of controls, technologies employed in the discovery and validation phases of the study, and the important identified differentially expressed proteins) of many selected proteomics or immunoassay\u2010based studies on these infectious diseases have been provided in Table 2. Critical analysis of the published literature from various research groups clearly indicates that the expression levels of many reported potential biomarkers are modulated similarly in several infectious diseases, irrespective of the type of the pathogen, this might be a result of generic acute\u2010phase/stress reactions, while the specifically modulated candidates in different pathogenic infections could be indicators of some unique responses. Differential expression profiles of a few selected serum proteins in different infectious diseases are shown in Fig. 2. Serum/plasma proteins, which show opposite trends of differential expression in some infections compared to other types of infectious diseases, are promising candidates for diagnosis and discrimination analysis. Interestingly, serum levels of haptoglobin (Hp) were found to be significantly lower in malaria patients (both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection). Hp, being a positive acute phase protein, exhibits upregulation in other infectious diseases (Fig. 2; Supporting Information Table 1). Hp sequesters free hemoglobin (Hb), which is released during pathogen\u2010induced hemolysis as Hp\u2013Hb complexes and leads to hypo\u2010 or ahaptoglobinemia. Hp is a promising inflammatory marker for evaluation of the severity of the Plasmodium infection and is a potential epidemiological marker for malaria 25, 26. Additionally, our comparative analysis of various infectious diseases indicates that even though some proteins, such as SAA or CRP, exhibit similar trends of differential expression (upregulation) in multiple infections, the levels of regulation (fold changes) are found to be quite different depending on the type of infectious agent, so these candidates could be effective classifiers for discriminating among different infectious manifestations (Fig. 2). It has been shown that establishment of a panel of serum biomarkers rather than a single candidate is much more effective for detection of specific infection and its discrimination from the other clinically related febrile illnesses 13. In our proteomic analyses, we have found that a panel of identified proteins consisting of six candidates (serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol\u2010binding protein, and apolipoprotein A\u2010I) can discriminate among malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis 13, 15, 16. Although these six proteins were not unique for malaria, dengue, or leptospirosis, the combination of their specific trends and levels of differential expression allowed the successful discrimination among these three infectious diseases having overlapping clinical manifestations. Within a panel, if the individual class prediction potential of the candidate markers is evaluated, it becomes apparent that each of them plays some specific contribution in discrimination of a particular infection from the healthy population and other related clinical manifestations. Therefore, we feel that the combination of clinicopathological parameters with serum/plasma markers can provide improved prediction accuracy for most diseases.",

Very often, in isolated proteomics studies, where only disease versus healthy controls are compared, differentially expressed candidates are found, but many are simply a consequence of generic acute phase reactions, which are misclaimed as promising markers (Fig. 3A). In real\u2010life scenarios, biomarker candidates that are commonly altered in multiple infectious diseases cannot effectively discriminate between different clinical manifestations, unless the levels of differential expression of these candidate proteins are significantly different in other infections, or if they are used as part of a marker panel along with other more specific candidates. Other reviews have demonstrated the frequent appearance of HSP27, HSP60, ATP synthase, \u03b2\u2010actin, and enolase 1 as differentially expressed candidates in various published tissue proteomics analyses performed by using 2DE in combination with MS 12, 27.

Preanalytical variations introduced during sample collection, handling, and storage process are also challenging for the determination of true biomarkers 28.

Findings obtained from this study indicate that while the effect of blood sample collection, processing, and handling processes is minimal on autoantibody biomarker measurements, these variables can substantially affect serum protein concentrations. Yi et al. have demonstrated the time\u2010dependent alterations in human plasma and serum proteins due to the proteolytic degradation by intrinsic plasma peptidases and proteases, and recommended the addition of protease inhibitors instantaneously with the blood samples during collection process to increase stabilization of the plasma proteins and prevent proteolysis\u2010related preanalytical variability 44. Repeated freeze\u2010thawing cycles also affect the serum/plasma protein stability and reproducibility of the obtained results, and should be avoided.

Definitely, the more the clinical cohorts studied, better the confidence level of the findings. Nevertheless, the analysis cost and the availability of suitable clinical samples often constrain the investigation of bigger clinical cohorts. Prior to the comparative proteomic analysis, power calculations should be performed to estimate the minimum number of biological replicates required from diseased and control populations. In a recent study, Gandhi et al. have shown through power calculation analysis that the DIGE experiment requires at least ten samples from each group to be confident of 1.5\u2010fold difference at the p < 0.05 significance level 47. However, the minimum sample size depends on the type of analysis, study population, and reproducibility of the experimental approaches implicated. It is generally advised to perform validation studies employing larger clinical cohorts than the sample size used in discovery phase 37. All in all, the design of appropriate proteomics experiments involving different types of febrile subjects as diseases controls, and validation of the initial findings in larger clinical cohorts using alternative technological approaches, is essential for obtaining conclusive protein markers for any specific infection that can subsequently be translated into real clinical applications.",

Certainly, information obtained from analysis of individual samples is much more reliable than the analysis of pooled samples, since pooling of samples may not effectively reflect the real biological alterations. Moreover, actual differences might be masked due to the presence of some outliers with extreme biological variability within the pooled cohorts. Nevertheless, pooling of clinical samples is often practiced in quantitative proteomics analysis, particularly when larger numbers of samples need to be studied or there is not an adequate amount of each sample for individual analysis. In proteomic investigations using pooled samples, it is more acceptable if multiple small pools of control and diseased samples are analyzed, rather than preparation of a single pooled set containing all the samples to be analyzed. If sample pooling is performed during the discovery phase of the analysis, it is essential to validate the results in individual diseased and control samples selected randomly from the pooled populations.",

Single time\u2010point analysis (case vs. control) involving the early febrile stage of infection may help to identify potential diagnostic markers. Longitudinal studies of infectious diseases, which involve repeated observations of the same subjects over long periods of time (early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages of infection), can provide additional valuable information regarding changes in the identified disease markers and their utility as disease monitoring or prognostic markers (Fig. 3B). To this end, a serum proteome and cytokine analysis in longitudinal cohorts of dengue fever and its life\u2010threatening complication dengue hemorrhagic fever has recently been reported by Kumar et al. 48. The authors have shown that an in\u2010depth investigation of serum proteome signatures at different time\u2010points during the infection and their correlation analysis with clinicopathological parameters can help to unravel mechanisms of dengue disease progression.

The objectives of the HUPO PPP include comprehensive analysis of the entire protein component of human plasma and serum, identification of the dynamic biological and physiological variation in the plasma proteome within an individual, as well as an estimation of the extent of variations between individuals within the same and different populations under normal and diseased conditions, which would be extremely useful for the design of clinical studies 51. The pilot phase of HUPO PPP included the results from 35 collaborating laboratories and analytical groups, and generated a core dataset of over 3000 proteins (each with two or more high\u2010confidence peptides) 18, which was reduced to 889 proteins once very stringent selection criteria were implemented in a separate analysis of same dataset 52. In addition to the HUPO PPP, the Human Plasma Peptide Atlas, established by incorporating LC\u2010MS/MS shotgun proteomics results from several experiments conducted in various laboratories 53, is another resource for studying human plasma proteins 54.",

Comparison and extrapolation of data generated in different research laboratories are possible only when uniform standards for proteomics procedures with negligible preanalytical and technological variations are practiced globally. To this end, in 2002, the HUPO PSI (http://psidev.sourceforge.net/) was established to develop universal reference standards for use in proteomics studies. These standard methods can be followed to introduce uniformity and reproducibility in data acquisition and analysis processes, which in turn can accelerate comparison, exchange, and interpretation of data 63, 64, and avoid the \u201cfragmentation of proteomics data\u201d generated in different research laboratories across the globe 65. The HUPO PSI committee is working on the development of standard operating procedures and quality assurance protocols for data handling and analysis at a global scale. Moreover, HUPO PSI's goal is to develop reporting requirements, data exchange formats, and controlled vocabularies to formalize the requirements of the proteomics community and to encourage participation in multidisciplinary collaborative projects, such as the Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) and Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO), in order to accelerate the collation, comparison, and analysis of \u201cmulti\u2010omics\u201d datasets 66.

Certainly, one of the most promising applications of proteomics in clinics is the identification of next generation diagnostic, prognostic, or disease biomarkers that can effectively improve diagnostics and therapeutics. High\u2010throughput proteomic technologies suitable for the rapid screening and quantification of thousands of analytes with high accuracy are needed for the finding of authentic biomarkers. Ultimately, the primary objective of proteomics biomarker discovery research is to establish novel candidate markers that can be clinically useful, as well as to translate the existing findings into practical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. However, in spite of having tremendous potential, actual bed\u2010side translation of the findings obtained from proteomic research has thus far been limited. The efforts of the proteomics community have started to show results, as is evident from success stories, such as the OVA1 test, which has obtained FDA clearance 73. Even though most of the biomarkers identified in various proteomic studies show promises in the discovery phases, they cannot get approval without passing the validation stage and clinical trials, which is a complex and long\u2010term procedure. While the global initiatives, such as the Human PPP, the Human Plasma Peptide Atlas, and the HUPO PSI, are designed to identify and characterize the inclusive proteomes of plasma, connect the existing plasma/serum proteomics studies across the world, and establish a high\u2010quality uniform standard for proteomics analysis, it is also the collective responsibility of individual research groups to integrate their research findings with these ongoing worldwide initiatives.",
