The core of the designed decision model is the forecasting model that attempts to ex-ante predict the cumulative flock mortality for the period between 8 and 28 d of age. Forecasts were generated with the parameters of the linear regression model where continuous values of daily mortalities served as a dependent variable. The decision variable is a binary (yes/no) choice variable, where \"yes\" means \"go ahead with treatment\" and \"no\" means \"do nothing\". If the predicted cumulative mortality for the period between 8 and 28 d of age exceeds 9% of the total initial placement, the model generates a \"yes\" signal. If the predicted cumulative mortality for the same period is below 9% of the total initial placement, the model generates a \"no\" signal. The results indicate a reasonable accuracy of the prediction model where the number of correct prediction increases and the number of incorrect predictions falls very fast as the forecasting window shortens.

Because of the clinical similarity of this disease to spiking mortality of broiler chickens (Craig, 1991; Davis et al., 1996) it became known as spiking mortality of turkeys (SMT). However, preliminary findings suggest that the two diseases are likely quite different from each other. During the next 2 yr, although more flocks were affected, the disease remained localized to the same area.

A milder form of SMT was suspected from epidemiological studies and subsequently confirmed by placing sentinels in affected flocks. This form of the disease was named excess mortality of turkeys (EMT), which is defined as a mortality between 2 and 9% during the 8 to 28 d age period without 3 consecutive d with mortality equal to or greater than 1%/d. To encompass both the SMT and EMT forms, the name Poult Enteritis Mortality Syndrome (PEMS) was proposed and adopted by the turkey industry. Because of recent management changes that result in turkeys being exposed at an older age, the disease may occur outside of the normal 8 to 28 d age period. Severe diarrheal disease and stunting occur when older birds are affected, but mortality tends to be lower.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Spiking mortality of turkeys occurs most commonly in the late spring and summer, typically appearing in the 21st wk of the year. It has been estimated from mortality records that around a quarter million turkeys died from SMT during the summer of 1994. One company reported losses of nearly a million dollars a week from SMT during the summer of 1995. Losses from morbidity (\"stunting\") likely exceed those from mortality. It is feared that SMT will likely continue to occur each year until effective measures to prevent and control it are developed. Although several approaches to control SMT, or lessen its impact on a flock, have been tried, only the use of a fluorquinolone antibiotic, sarafloxacin, has shown any benefit. Treatment with sarafloxacin substantially reduces mortality, but has little impact on morbidity (unpublished data). Because diarrheal diseases are so common in young turkey flocks and most are not SMT or PEMS, it would be beneficial to be able to predict which flocks are likely to have SMT in order to effectively use the antibiotic. The judicious use of antibiotics both from the cost-efficiency and the selection of resistant strains of bacteria standpoints cannot be overemphasized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The cause of SMT is unknown. One or more viruses are thought to be responsible for initiating the disease and causing stunting and immunosuppression; secondary bacterial proliferation in the immunologically impaired turkey is considered the cause of the high mortality.

More recently, coronaviruses have been associated with affected flocks (Goodwin et al., 1995) .

Based on what has been known about the disease so far, we hypothesize that daily mortality can be explained by a set of explanatory variables including its own history (i.e., lagged daily mortality values, history of the disease on the farm, and presence or absence of the disease in the preceding flock), temperature, humidity, flock size, and the presence and the number of overlapping generations on the farm. Controlling for those affects, in all other aspects, we assume that farms and flocks are approximately homogenous. Given the geographical proximity of the farms and relatively similar technology they use, the assumption that the differences among farms and flocks are negligible does not seem overly restrictive. This assumption allows us to pool the data from different farms and different flocks together by vertically stacking daily mortalities into one column vector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Spiking Mortality"}, {"text": "For the purposes of explaining the incidence of mortality today (and then predict the occurrence of mortality tomorrow), we exploit information in the historical data on mortality through the use of three groups of explanatory variables. First, we use lagged daily mortality values. Due to the nature of the data set, in which observations from different farms and different flocks were pooled together, using lagged values of the dependent variable as explanatory variables would cause unwanted causalities. For example, at the point where the first flock ends and the second flock begins, the behavior of the second flock's mortality would be erroneously explained by the first flock's characteristics. In order to avoid this problem, the data set was manipulated by deleting the necessary number of observations (depending on the number of lags included in the model specification) at the beginning of each flock such that each flock's mortality is explained only by its own lagged values. An empirical question to be answered here is how many lags (days) to include in the model specification. Ideally, this should be determined based on the observed characteristics of the disease. However, at this point too little is known about the daily dynamics of the spiking mortality, and we had to rely solely on the statistical techniques. Secondly, we used dummy variables to single out farms with the previous incidence of the disease on the farm. The variable assumes the value of 1 for farms on which SMT had previously occurred, and 0 in cases where there was no history of SMT on the farm. Finally, we use another set of dummy variables to identify flocks immediately following flocks in which SMT had occurred. The variable assumes the value of 1 for the flock whose immediately preceding flock was diagnosed with SMT and 0 elsewhere. The expected signs for all those variables are positive, meaning that we anticipate the current incidence of the disease to be positively correlated with its own history.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Spiking Mortality"}, {"text": "The second critical set of explanatory variables are meteorological observations. The main characteristic of the disease is its seasonality. The correlation between warm weather and the incidence of the disease has been well documented. Additionally, a pronounced mortality has been noticed in periods of unusually high nightly temperatures or abnormally high lows. Based on these observations, two different explanatory variables were included in the model. The first one measures the maximum temperature recorded on a given day, and the second measures the difference between the maximum and the minimum temperature on a given day. Maximum temperature serves as a proxy for seasonality, and the range variable measures the importance of the day and night temperature differences on mortality. We expect the sign of the maximum temperature to be positive and the sign of the temperature range variable to be negative. In other words, as the maximum temperature increases, mortality of turkeys should rise, and as the temperature range increases (i.e., the nights get cooler), the mortality decreases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Spiking Mortality"}, {"text": "In addition to the positive correlation between temperature and mortality, it has also been hypothesized that humidity or dew point may be important factors in explaining the outbreak of the disease. To test these hypotheses, two explanatory variables were included in the regression model: relative humidity and dew point. The expected sign on both variables is positive, which is to say that we expect mortality to increase as humidity and dew point rise.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Spiking Mortality"}, {"text": "The third group of explanatory variables is of secondary importance but can provide valuable information for understanding the disease through testing whether hypothesized variables have statistically significant effects on daily mortality. The flock daily size variable was included in the model to capture the effects of factors such as congestion and litter moisture. The variable was defined as the difference between the total initial placement and cumulative mortality up to that day. The expected sign for the daily size variable is positive. Finally, we also experimented with the data on overlapping generations. By recording the dates of entry and exit of individual flocks, we were able to count the number of different turkey generations simultaneously present on each farm. This information was included in the model through the use of binary (dummy) variables measuring the simultaneous presence or absence of different age cohorts on a given farm. We expect multiple age cohorts farms to be more likely affected by the spiking mortality than single age cohort (\"all in -all out\") farms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modeling Spiking Mortality"}, {"text": "The data set used in this research contains observations on daily mortalities from 1,050 turkey flocks collected on farms in the southwestern part of North Carolina (mainly Union county) in the period between December, 1993 and November, 1995.

Of 1,050 flocks, 64 satisfied the definition of spiking mortality in turkeys (i.e., with the cumulative mortality between 8 and 28 d of age in excess of 9% of the initial placement). For the entire sample period, the mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum of cumulative mortality rates for flocks with no SMT were 2.06, 1.64, 0.00, and 8.81, respectively. These values increased to 16.46, 7.99, 9.01, and 46 .40 for the SMT flocks. The time pattern of cumulative mortality rates by flock is presented in Figure 1 . The statistics show that the summer increase in the mortality rates culminates in June and July. The mortality actually begins to increase in April and returns to its normal level in September. Whereas the first 3 and the last 4 mo of the calendar year are not statistically different from each other, the difference between the monthly means for the April to August period is statistically different from other monthly means. Aside from the daily mortality data, we also collected data on outside temperature, relative humidity, and dew point.

Seasonality of the disease is best described by interpreting these two meteorological variables together. As weather gets warmer, we expect to see an increase in daily mortality. However, if the difference between night and day temperatures is large, the relative effect of warm weather decreases. Alternatively, the Range coefficient may be interpreted as an indicator of humidity in the sense that a higher range of daily temperatures signals a lower humidity. In this case, as the humidity decreases, the relative effect of high temperatures also decreases. The magnitude of the Tmax coefficient indicates that if the maximum temperature increases by 1 F, other things being equal, we expect additional 0.148 turkeys to die. The effect of the Size variable is positive, as anticipated, and significant. It is true that mortality increases with density; however the estimated magnitude of the effect is extremely small. The dummy variable DfarmS, defined as 1 for farms on which SMT has previously occurred, and 0 in cases where there was no history of SMT on the farm, is positive.

The same routine can be repeated if one wants to generate predictions further out into the future. For example, standing at Day 7 and having all information available up to that time, we can forecast the entire 8 to 28 d window and sum up individual daily mortality predictions to obtain the prediction of the cumulative mortality needed to forecast the SMT. One can easily see that the quality of forecasts as measured by the prediction error is going to deteriorate as one forecasts further into the future. As mentioned earlier, the data on 221 flocks were saved for out-of-sample validation. The predictions are generated by using the observed values for Tmax and Range instead of the required out-of-sample forecasts. This restriction is fairly mild, as the contemporaneous correlation coefficient between daily temperatures in 1994 and 1995 equals 0.7316. The initial flock placement is known at Day 1, so this number is always available at the beginning of the forecasting exercise. The first set of predictions starts at Day 7 and predicts mortalities from Day 8 to 28, the second set of predictions starts at Day 8 and predicts Day 9 to 28, and the last one starts at Day 26, predicting only Days 27 and 28. In addition to generating point predictions, we also calculated their 95% prediction intervals. If the upper prediction limit of the cumulative mortality exceeds 9%, the model would generate a \"yes\" signal. The problem in constructing the prediction interval is how to obtain the correct standard errors because the model predicts the daily mortality rates, whereas the required cumulative mortality rate is obtained by summing up daily mortalities from Day 8 to 28. One approach to solving this apparent problem is to bootstrap the prediction interval. The main part of the data set used to estimate the model parameters containing 829 flocks was used to generate in-sample predictions and compare them to their respective true numbers. The procedure was repeated 20 times, i.e., for each day between Days 7 and 26. For each of the 20 iterations, 829 prediction error bootstraps were generated. The empirical distribution of the bootstraps enables the calculation of the standard error of these prediction errors.

Therefore, part of that relatively high percentage of correct SMT signals is the consequence of the extremely wide confidence interval.
