Evidence based standards for safe practice under these circumstances are yet to be established. Several publications have emerged recently specifically describing safer techniques and protocols for extubation. D'Silva and colleagues recommend that extubation take place in a negative pressure room, if possible. Adequately trained staff for re-intubation (experienced anesthesia providers, respiratory therapists) be present if an emergency re-intubation is necessary, equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) and preferably, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). Only minimum staff required for the extubation procedure should be present, with any other staff available outside the room for emergencies. All team members should wear PPE including at minimum an N95 facemask and eye-protection. Orotracheal suctioning should be minimized in order to reduce the number of times this potentially aerosolizing procedure is performed. The authors also recommended the use of supplemental oxygen connected in series to two high efficiency particulate air [HEPA] Viral filters. After extubation, non-rebreathed oxygen at a FiO2 of 100% is provided via the ventilator for post-oxygenation [10].",

            "text": "In order to reduce risk of staff exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during high-risk procedures, barrier hood devices have been proposed, with a mixed response in the literature. The first known hood was described as an \u201cAerosol Box\u201d constructed of durable plexi-glass. This device was intended for use in low resource situations where PPE was not adequately available for healthcare workers involved in high risk procedures [15]. A hood of this type was evaluated by Canelli et al. who concluded in a simulated intubation experiment that such a hood prevented the spread of aerosolized particles [4]. Results were similar in an experiment by Matava et al. who performed essentially the same procedure [16]. Response to this experiment has been mixed, with some authors suggesting that restricted hand movements might result in safety hazards to the patient, as patients with COVID-19 often require rapid intubation, rescue breaths with a mask, and/or suctioning to obtain a clear view of the vocal cords. Other disadvantages of the durable plexi-glass hood device include that it requires meticulous decontamination, and might be difficult to transport from patient to patient in emergent situations [17]. Other groups have suggested the use of a simple plastic sheet covering the entire patient as a barrier protection in high risk airway procedures, which has the theoretical advantage of being cheap and easily replaceable. Decreased access to the patient in emergency settings makes this device less desirable [12,18].",
