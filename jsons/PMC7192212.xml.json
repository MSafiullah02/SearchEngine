The number of submissions has increased significantly, and the journal now publishes six issues each year. More importantly, the quality and diversity of the publications also improved progressively. While Respirology remains firmly the regional respiratory journal for Asian and Pacific countries, the last 12 months have seen publication of articles from many countries beyond this region. The published papers not only covered issues of local interest, but also addressed worldwide respiratory problems through large clinical trials, authoritative reviews, as well as small pilot studies establishing proof of principles of exciting novel concepts.",
