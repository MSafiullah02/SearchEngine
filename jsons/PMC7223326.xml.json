            "text": "In the recent decades, dengue has emerged as one of the world\u2019s most dominant tropical diseases (Guzman et al. 2016) with around 390 million (95% credible interval 284 to 528 million) cases recorded per year, of which only 96 million (95% credible interval 67 to 136 million) cases were manifested clinically (Giraldo-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Osorio, 2019; Bhatt et al. 2013). According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimate of 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are living in areas with a high risk of dengue infection (Brady et al. 2012). The recently estimated annual 390 million dengue cases reveals that the dengue disease burden has tripled as compared to previous predictions of 50 to 100 million reported cases without dengue warning signs. Nonetheless, 250,000 to 500,000 patients were hospitalised due to dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD), and the total annual cost of dengue burden was estimated globally around US$ 8.9 billion (Giraldo-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Osorio, 2019; Guzman et al. 2016). In spite of having paucity of effective vaccines and drugs to expel dengue comprehensively, still it\u2019s enduring a big challenge to human (Martina et al. 2009). Therefore, next-generation vaccine strategies such as inactivated purified virus, DNA or protein-based subunit vaccines, and their fusion chimeras are now going under investigation and some of them even under clinical trials (Coller et al. 2011; Danko et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Recently, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine has been approved for use in some of the highly dengue endemic areas where the sero-prevalence is higher than 70% (Guy et al. 2015; Pang et al. 2018). According to WHO, it has shown significant efficacy and acceptable safety profile during clinical trials in seropositive individuals; however, it carries a risk of severe dengue infection in seronegative individuals, and also failed to confer subsequent protection in DENV-2 positive people in areas with less exposure of dengue (Arredondo-Garc\u00eda et al. 2018; Durbin et al. 2011; Guy et al. 2011). Several other vaccine candidates were also formulated based on live-attenuated dengue viruses (e.g. TV003, TV005) and inactivated purified virus (e.g. DPIV), of which some have already completed clinical trials and some are currently going under phase II to III clinical trials (Whitehead et al. 2017; Diaz et al. 2018). On the other hand, DNA or protein-based alternative subunit vaccines (e.g. TVDV, DEN-80) and dengue-flavivirus chimeras (e.g. EDIII-p64k, 80E-STF2, EDIII-HbsAg) are going either under preclinical study or phase I clinical test (Govindarajan et al. 2015; Danko et al. 2018; Casta\u00f1o-Osorio et al., 2019). Although, still most of them are seemed to be slow immunity booster and require a strong adjuvant and longer immunisation to achieve full protection against each of the dengue serotype, which all make them ill-suited for universal vaccine licence (Casta\u00f1o-Osorio et al., 2019).",

            "text": "The dengue envelope (E) protein is composed of three ecto-domains, a membrane-proximal stem and a transmembrane anchor (Klein et al. 2013). Various crystal structures have shown that the ecto-domains are arranged into three antiparallel dimer on virus surface in a icosahedral symmetry, where ecto-domain I (EI) is located at the centre holding domain II (EDII) and III (EDIII) in two opposite sites in each of the monomer of a dimeric unit (Fibriansah et al. 2015; Kuhn et al. 2002; Modis et al. 2004). Most of the protective antibodies against dengue virus are identified to domain III, and initially were thought to be a potential subunit vaccine target (Murphy and Whitehead 2011; Sukupolvi-Petty et al. 2010). Although, recombinant EDIII domain injected by plasmid DNA or purified from bacterial expression systems was found to be poorly immunogenic, and has shown low protective efficacy in animal model (Guzman et al. 2010). On the other hand, EDII has been reported as the dimerisation domain and consists of the most conserved fusion (Fu) and bc loop (Li et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2004). Several studies have also shown that the conserved Fu loop is highly immunogenic (Lai et al. 2008; Cherrier et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2013), and induces cross-reactive antibodies, of which some are cross-talk with adjacent bc loop (Gallichotte et al., 2015; Cherrier et al. 2009). Moreover, during endocytosis, both of the loops are found to involve in tertiary conformation of membrane fusion (Nayak et al. 2009; Sukupolvi-Petty et al. 2010). Therefore, it has been anticipated that both of the loops might have integrated role for boosting cross-neutralizing immunity.",

Although, the recombinant antigen in isolation tends to be poorly immunogenic in vivo; the use of potent immunomodulating compounds, fusion partner or suitable delivery systems improve specific immune response (Higgins et al. 2007; Gar\u00e7on et al. 2011). Herein, we have expressed the recombinant Fubc antigenic protein, optimised its large-scale purification protocol and finally evaluated its protein-specific immune response in BALB/c mice. Prior to the animal challenge, its secondary structure was checked by CD spectroscopy, and binding specificity was cross-checked with a characterised anti-fusion loop scFv antibody (Rathore et al. 2019).",

In order to construct stable and immunogenic protein, highly conserved fusion (Fu) and bc loops and their neighbouring residues (amino acid residues 62 to 122) were selected by using antigen variability analyser (AVANA), pBLAST and multiple sequence alignment tool of NCBI. For convenient expression in bacteria, all of the oligos were codon optimised for E. coli, using codon optimisation tool of Integrated DNA Technology. Complete Fubc gene was constructed by assembly PCR reactions using four 60 nucleotide long overlapping oligonucleotides. For cloning into pET28a expression vector, two unique restriction sites, EcoRI and XhoI, were also incorporated at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends respectively during the final amplification of Fubc full-length gene using forward and reverse primers. Initially, the full-length Fubc gene was cloned into a TA cloning vector using InsTAclone kit (Thermo Scientific). Positive clones were screened using X-gal blue-white screening method and digested with EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The digested Fubc gene was further sub-cloned into a pET28a expression vector. The recombinant plasmid (Fubc + pET28a) was transformed into E. coli XL-10 GOLD for cloning, and subsequently into E. coli BL-21 Rosetta (DE3) for protein expression.",

The remaining pellet was re-solubilised using mild denaturing agent such as 4.0 M urea and 5% n-propanol along with PBS buffer (pH 8.1) (Sarker et al. 2019) and was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min.

The column was pre-equilibrated with PBS (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl), and the protein sample was eluted with the same PBS buffer. 0.5 ml protein sample was injected in each run by using 0.5 ml loop at 0.4 ml/min flow rate. The elution profile of injected protein was followed by monitoring UV absorbance at 280 nm on the AKTA FPLC system with U9-L UV monitor. Different peaks greater than 20 mAU were collected in fraction collector and checked using a 15% SDS PAGE. Multiple runs of FPLC were carried out, and the fraction containing Fubc protein was pooled together.

The CD spectra of PBS buffer and Fubc protein samples at 0.1 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml concentrations (diluted in 50 mM and 10 mM PBS buffer, pH 7.4) were recorded at far UV spectra ranging from 200 to 280 nm with a step size of 1 nm to bandwidth 1 nm.

The baseline CD spectrum of the buffer was deducted from the spectrum containing the protein to yield the actual Fubc protein CD spectrum. The mean residue ellipticity [\u03b8] mrw at wavelength \u03bb was quoted in units of degree cm2/dmol, and was calculated as [\u03b8] mrw, \u03bb = MRW \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb/10 \u00d7 d \u00d7 c, where \u03b8 is the observed ellipticity (degrees) at wavelength \u03bb, d is the path length (cm) and c is the concentration (g/ml).

For coupling of Fubc protein on gold disc, 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were applied for activation. NHS activates the carboxymethyl groups by creating a highly reactive succinimide ester on the disc surface, which reacts with amine and other nucleophilic groups on proteins that subsequently help to bind the target protein on activated disc surface. Ethanolamine was added to block the remaining activated carboxymethyl group. For the qualitative assay, all of the serum samples (diluted in running buffer) were applied at a flow rate of 20 \u03bcl/min over 2 min. In between injections, the surface of the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 2 M NaCl at the same flow rate for 15 s.

Further studies have revealed that these conserved regions are the part of previously characterised flavivirus fusion (Fu) and bc loop (Kuhn et al. 2002). During the process of endocytosis, this hydrophobic fusion loop remains buried at the dimer interface in the prefusion state and forms cluster into larger hydrophobic surface at one end to form trimer at later state that finally initiates membrane fusion (Klein et al. 2013). In addition to this structural property, Fu and bc regions consist some of the most potent antigenic epitopes that were identified by DENV neutralising conformation sensitive anti-DENV hMAbs (Goncalvez et al. 2007; Costin et al. 2013; Yamanaka et al. 2013).

Ironically, due to the absence of anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and a single protein frame of Fu and bc loops, these two separately expressed peptides fail to form similar three-dimensional conformation as in original DENV envelop (Fig. 1c).

The Fubc gene was then cloned into a TA cloning vector, and the clones were screened by colony PCR using Fubc gene specific end primers. Two positive clones were then confirmed by restriction digestion using EcoRI and XhoI enzymes (Fig. S1a\u2013d). The digested and purified Fubc insert gene was further sub-cloned into pET28a expression vector, and the positive clones were confirmed by restriction digestion (Fig. S2b) and Sanger sequencing.",

Therefore, Fubc expression level was checked further by lowering growth temperature and IPTG concentration, but no significant change was noticed in supernatant fraction. Chaperone-assisted folding system did not help remarkably to express the Fubc recombinant protein in the soluble form. Therefore, the insoluble pellet fraction of Fubc protein was further utilised in mild solubilisation process (Sarker et al. 2019) to recover soluble Fubc protein. Initially, the recovered soluble Fubc protein fraction was purified by using Ni-NTA agarose beads, and the purified protein band was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. S3). Although, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography has not revealed good purification quality and the yield was also not sufficient. Furthermore, gel filtration chromatography was used to recover good quality large-scale recombinant protein, and single distinct peak greater than 20 mAU was observed at approximately 20.57 ml position for all of injected Fubc protein samples (Fig. 2a). After pooling together, the peak fractions were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and single bright band was observed at molecular weight 11.5 kDa (Fig. 2b).",

Due to the absence of highly specific neutralising antibodies in secondary infections, cross-reactive non-neutralising antibodies usually enhance the dengue severity (De Alwis et al. 2014). According to the revised dengue case classification (DENCO), 2 to 3% of secondary infections with another serotype causes life threating dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD). It was reported that serotype-cross-reactive non-neutralising antibodies enhance the entry of dengue genome into Fc receptor-bearing monocyte cells and promote disease severity by a process known as antibody-depended enhancement (ADE) (Casta\u00f1o-Osorio et al. 2019; Flipse et al. 2013). That means nature of the antibody response to DENV is most likely to play a major role in defining disease outcome. Therefore, it is predictable that antibodies that recognise specific neutralizing epitopes help in virus clearance and reduce symptoms; however, antibodies that recognise non-neutralising epitopes lead to more severe forms of disease like DWS+/SD. Hence, there is an urgent need for an advanced vaccine which could generate highly specific and cross-neutralising antibody (Costin et al. 2013).",

The most advanced candidate, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), was licenced in some of the dengue endemic countries (Imai and Ferguson 2018). However, it was revealed risky in children or na\u00efve dengue patient with severe infection as they were vaccinated (Arredondo-Garc\u00eda et al. 2018). Therefore, considering safety issues, production of recombinant subunit vaccine with efficient immune protective properties is looking attractive (Govindarajan et al. 2015). Meanwhile, an admixture of four live attenuated recombinant dengue vaccine TV003/TV005 have completed Phase III clinical trial and licenced to several manufacturers including Butantan, VaBiotech and Merk (Whitehead et al. 2017). Moreover, some recombinant tetravalent vaccines (e.g. DEN-80E, TVDV) expressing the prM and E genes of each of the four DENV serotypes from plasmid DNA, have already completed phase I clinical trial (Govindarajan et al. 2015; Danko et al. 2018). It has also been shown that the recombinant dengue envelope domain III can inhibit dengue infectivity, and induce dengue-neutralising immunoglobulin in mice (Hermida et al. 2006). In addition, a number of antibodies which were raised in mice and chimpanzees against dengue domain II fusion loop were found cross-reactive to other flaviviruses (Goncalvez et al. 2004; Stiasny et al. 2006). Although, the hMABs specific to dengue domain II fusion loop were not found equally effective on other flaviviruses including WNV, YFV and other DENV strain (Costin et al. 2013). Therefore, it was conjectured that adjacent to the fusion loop, additional contact residues of original domain II surface structure might be involved to raise cross-neutralizing antibodies.",

The E. coli expression system was used here, and the recombinant protein was found to be expressed in higher quantity, though most of the protein was extracted initially in pellet fraction. No significant change was noticed by altering regular growth temperature and inducer concentration. Therefore, we have utilised the mild-solubilisation methodology to recover soluble Fubc protein from insoluble pellet protein. For purification, firstly, we have used convenient Ni-NTA affinity purification method, and by adjusting the lysis and elution buffer, we were able to purify recombinant Fubc protein to some extent but the quality and quantity was not sufficient. Finally, to scale up the quality protein production, size exclusion chromatography was used in AKTA FPLC system. To confirm the recombinant protein expression, simple western blot was performed by using anti-His monoclonal antibody as primary. Furthermore, in vitro structural integrity and functional authenticity of the experimental Fubc protein were also verified by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3) and indirect ELISA (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "However, most of the hMABs identified earlier from dengue patient serum were predominantly cross-reactive and recognise epitopes containing highly conserved residues at the Fu loop of domain II (Lai et al. 2008). However, having such sequence homology in Fu loop of all flaviviruses, these hMABs are non-neutralizing against heterologous serotypes (Lai et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2013) and thus was found to be responsible for ADE in animals (Goncalvez et al. 2007). Previously, it has also been stated that this scenario might happen due to the cryptic nature and poor accessibility of the fusion loop epitope on the surface of the mature virion (Lai et al. 2008; Cherrier et al. 2009). However, in addition to the partially exposed fusion loop on immature flaviviruses, some neutralizing hMAbs were also found to bind with bc loop (Costin et al. 2013). Therefore, it is suggestive that along with conserved fusion loop, adjacent less conserved linker sequence and bc loop might be required to be exposed as a whole to generate effective cross-neutralizing immunity. Our current mouse immunisation experiment also supports this idea as it was observed that the antibody response to full length Fubc protein was stronger than the response elicited by the Fu and Bc peptides in separate (Figs. 4 and 5).",

These observations were also symmetrical with other studies where it was stated that female mice have a better immune response due to the higher number of leukocytes occupying the naive peritoneal and pleural cavities, and also have a number of T- and B-lymphocytes as well as macrophages (Terres et al. 1968; Weinstein et al. 1984; Klein et al. 2015). Therefore, we have used female mice serum samples for further qualitative ELISA and SPR test to quantify immune response of recombinant Fubc protein. It was noticed that IgG antibody response to Fu, and bc peptides were significantly lower than the response observed to Fubc recombinant protein, and the immune response achieved to Fu and Bc peptide with Freund\u2019s adjuvant was significantly higher as compared to the peptides without adjuvant and serum control (Fig. 5). Two-way ANOVA was also performed to analyse the significance of IgG immune responses between Fubc + FA and Fubc without FA; Fu, bc Peptide + FA and Fu, bc Peptide without FA. From F values and P values obtained by ANOVA test, it can be interpreted that the difference between Fubc protein with Freund\u2019s adjuvant and Fu, bc Peptide with Freund\u2019s adjuvant were significantly higher than protein and peptides injected without Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Table S2). Also, the IgG response to recombinant Fubc protein was recorded better than Fu and bc peptides in both cases either with or without adjuvant. In addition, the p value of IgG immune response between Fubc protein with FA and without FA was found insignificant (p = 0.1740 > 0.05) that suggests that Fubc without any adjuvant is sufficient to elicit significant immune response (Table S2). Consistently, it was observed by SPR experiment that the refractive index of Fubc + FA was significantly higher than Fubc + without FA and serum control (Fig. 6b).",

Due to the presence of highly conserved fusion loop epitope, overlapping less conserved linker sequences and also bc epitope, this fusion protein might induce cross-neutralisation immunity against heterologous dengue serotypes. Though, still a lot of investigations, like the evaluation of a proper adjuvant to induce robust immune response, the memory immune response generated against the Fubc protein both by humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and whether this memory response will provide protection against a secondary encounter with DENV, are required before going clinical trial.

Another major factor that plays in conformation of Fu and bc loops is the disulphide linkage between the two highly conserved loop in the Fubc protein that ensures the same conformation of DENV envelope as it is shown in b and c, and d due to the lack of anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and same protein frame while these peptides are expressed separately, it is unlike to form di-sulphide linkage and fold in the same conformation as reside in DENV envelope and Fubc proteins",
