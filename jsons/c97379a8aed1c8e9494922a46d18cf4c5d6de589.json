However, the United States ignored these warnings. In the early winter of 1950, the American aggressors crossed the 38th parallel and attacked the areas around Yalu River and Tumen River as well as the airspace of Northeast China. Many a Chinese were killed in bomb attacks and property was ruined. As the national security was seriously threatened, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea on October 19, 1950 , and began the great war of \"aiding Korea and defending the homeland.\"",

Economy: While half of the world's population was involved in World War II, causing 100 million deaths or injuries, the United States somewhat benefi tted from the war. It quickly grew into the largest industrial power in the world. At that time, the US industrial output value accounted for more than half of the total capitalist world industrial output value. US steel production reached 87.72 million tons in 1950; wheat production accounted for more than 30 % of production of the capitalist countries; the industrial and agricultural output value reached 150.7 billion US dollars. In 1949, the US gold reserves were valued at more than 24.7 billion USD, accounting for 70 % of the total gold reserves of the entire capitalist world. In the aggression against Korea, the direct expenses of the war of the United States reached more than 20 billion USD. War material destined for North Korea totaled 73 million tons (Peng Dehuai 1953 ) . In comparison, the nascent PRC from the ruins of wars did not even completely liberate all its territory. Successive wars not only crippled China's modern industry but also damaged its primitive agriculture. In 1950, New China's industrial and agricultural output value was only 57.4 billion yuan, less than a fractional amount of that of the United States if converted into US dollars.",

After investigating in Northeast China and North Korea, scientists of the International Scientifi c Commission collected a body of evidence (physical specimens including insects, bacteria, and other clinical evidence) for the Investigation of the Pacts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China. A conclusion had been drawn that the United States had organized a large-scale, disguised germ warfare. Dr. Joseph Needham, who was a member of the Royal Society of Biologists and the International Scientifi c Commission, published an open letter saying that the truth of the germ warfare \"was by no means determined by what the air force personnel confessed, nor was it determined by what they had denied in the new and different circumstances\" (Li Siguang 1953 ). Dr. Samuel B. Pessoa (Brazil), also a member of the International Scientifi c Commission and who participated in the investigation, wrote after his visit to \"Exhibitions of Crimes Committed in the Germ Warfare of the U.S. Government\": \"Although it appeals to the broad mass of the population, the exposure process of all the facts is highly scientifi c; it is in no way exaggerated; it is with the aim to explain the truth, or to explain the real situation.

Far from being merely a process of \"medical progress,\" the modern system of Western medicine was also a social process in which the technology for social organization and social control continuously improved and intensifi ed. The medical system virtually became the origin of the \"modern political system.\" In defi ning what is \"healthy\" and what is \"unhealthy,\" what is hygienic and what is unhygienic, modern medicine also implies political or moral judgments of being \"sinful\" or \"decadent.\" More importantly, Foucault believed that the modern medical system, which originated from state behavior, such as controlling the spread of epidemics, was also an \"aggressive system\" full of \"war mentality.\" In etiology, all diseases come from the infection of bacteria (microorganisms), to practice medicine is to fi ght with microbes, and to be a doctor is to be a warrior. Diseases cannot be wiped out without a social system of well-organized, combative doctorpolice. That is why the practice of the Western colonial countries or imperialistic countries was discovered to have a close connection with modern hygiene when they were rebuilding the world order. Apartheid was necessary because the colonized people were thought to be the sources of communicable diseases in addition to being cheap labor resources. The metaphor of the \"Sick Man of East Asia\" implied physical and moral denigration to the oppressed state and its people; in addition, the world police system is to prevent, control, and eradicate what was, in their eyes, the physical diseases as well as the social \"diseases\" -resistance, revolts, rebels, etc. 6",

Through the writings of famous thinkers and theorists in modern times, we can discover that almost without exception, they would emphasize this feature of the state: Hobbes described the state directly as a potentially violent \"Leviathan\"; Karl Marx argued that the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class at the hands of another; Max Weber articulated his celebrated defi nition of the state as a human community that \"successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a given territory.\" Giddens even considers \"military industrialization\" the defi ning moment from the traditional country to the modern nation-state. Organized violence of the state not only became a space construction instrument dividing the borders and establishing boundaries but also played a crucial role in the process of colonization when the original pattern of world trade drastically changed, a new world order and market order were created, and the advantageous position of the Western counties was assured. The premodern agrarian countries were defenseless when confronted with such organized, monopolized, and industrialized state violence. The fi asco of combating the Western countries undermined the sense of superiority and confidence these agricultural countries originally enjoyed. More often than not, they felt hopeless and shameful in being forced to cede their territory and pay indemnities. The frequent attacks of feelings of hopelessness and shamefulness would suppress their original resistance awareness and let them accept the status quo.

The \"sick men\" was turned from a metaphor to a self-portrait of and a realistic oppressive discourse to the Chinese people of the time. Of course, it also meant space and possibility for resistance to the \"oppression.\"",

This situation was aggravated in the Song Dynasty. \"When it is established that the emphasis is on the civil side, the military side has faded, and the atmosphere is sort of soft. Two millenniums of corruption are deep in the brain of the civilians\" (Liang Qichao 1999 ) . Opium importation, the fl ooding of opium after the Opium War, especially, consumed not only China's fi nancial resources but also the nationals themselves. In addition, in the frenzied plunder and exploitation of the Western countries, coupled with the infl ux of Western industrial products, the country's economy rapidly slumped and the people's living standards were dramatically lowered, and the infi rmity due to malnutrition had become chronic. Different from the traditional relatively static agrarian society, there tended to be more interactions among people who were involved in modern industry and commerce, which was conducive to the spread of diseases. Thus, scenery of a \"sick country\" consisting of \"sick people\" emerged.",

Why hadn't they stepped onto the highroad to health earlier? Who should be responsible for the overall \"sickness\" of the state? Besides internal inspection, the external reasons were also uncovered and questioned. The new state attributed the internal and the historical reasons to the \"old exploitative system,\" which was entirely consistent with William McNeill's theory of the \"microparasite\" and \"macroparasite.\" In McNeil's mind, the relationship between the ruler and the ruled in human history is macroparasitic, while the relationship between the human body and the pathogenic microorganisms is microparasitic (McNeill 1988 ) . The existence of the \"parasites\" not only produces such social ills as prostitution or drugs but also weakens the effective unity of the grassroots society during the national crisis. The bottomless pit of double \"parasites\" made the grassroots society miserable. Perhaps this could be cited as a reason why Mao Zedong felt so exhilarated that he spent a sleepless night when learning the news that schistosomiasis was eradicated in Yujiang.",

The exploitative means of the parasite countries included, among other things, the ceding of territory, fi nancial exploitation, priorities the Western countries claimed, and unfair market competition in the coastal areas and in the inland areas alike. The multiple parasites and long-time extortion made the oncerich-and-beautiful exploited countries become ugly, weak, and sick. The state and its people were both sick.

Next, diseases caused by microparasites, communicable diseases especially, were used as a means to extend the rights or benefi ts of the macroparasites (the plague in northeast China in Part I can be referred to in this regard). In addition, advanced medicine was imported to strengthen its advantageous and civilized position so that the sentiments of resistance or rebelling of the colonial people could be broken down in a secret and artful way. Furthermore, when the macroparasites went through a crisis in their survival, microparasite could be turned to as the last resort; \"germ warfare\" was invoked as a means to debilitate the combating force in the colonial area and to incur social panic.",

While the Western society used modern hygiene to construct the metaphor of the \"sick men\" and to establish the colonial order, those \"sick men,\" who now had means of criticism at their hands, also used the knowledge framework for modern hygiene to create a basic narrative model and correspondent discourse system of the \"virus or pathogens versus colonizers or aggressors.\" 7 In a time when a variety of discourses and thoughts of \"modern,\" \"modernity,\" \"postmodern,\" and even \"post-postmodern\" emerge, \"farewell\" seems to have become a popular and fashionable word in contemporary China: \"a farewell to the tradition,\" \"a farewell to revolution,\" \"a farewell to ideology,\" and \"a farewell to the state.\" However, can one so easily bid farewell?",
