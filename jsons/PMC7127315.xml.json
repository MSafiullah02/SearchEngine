Its main clinical manifestations in patients are pneumonia (or respiratory) failure and acute renal failure.4 The short-lived but alarming epidemic SARS-CoV killed nearly 10% of approximately 8000 cases in the 2002\u20132003 outbreak.5 The data so far indicate that MERS-CoV possesses an unusually high crude mortality rate of approximately 50%, implying a big threat to people who are infected. Clusters of cases including a UK family, and hospitals in KSA, France and UAE show epidemiological evidence of human-to-human transmission. Indeed, existing reports indicate person-to-person transmission occurs, raising significant concern on the possible emergence of a global epidemic in the near future.6, 7, 8 It is therefore of utmost importance to pay worldwide attention to find antiviral drugs and effective vaccines to control its high death rate and spread.",

MERS-CoV binds to DPP4 via the S protein and releases the RNA genome into the target cell.2 The MERS-CoV S protein is a type-I membrane glycoprotein and contains S1 and S2 subunits.15 The S1 domain determines cellular tropism and interacts with the target cell, while the S2 domain mediates membrane fusion.13, 16 According to recent studies, the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) is mapped to the S1 region.17, 18 MERS-CoV RBD binds to the receptor and induces significant neutralizing antibody responses, indicating that it can be used as a candidate target for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.19 Herein, we review recent studies on MERS-CoV to make suggestions on antiviral vaccine and drug development.",

Therefore we used Pro-origami to automatically generate the schematic representation of the MERS-CoV RBD topology.21 The MERS-CoV RBD has a core and an external subdomain (Fig. 1\nA and B). The core subdomain is a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet (\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b24, \u03b25, and \u03b210) decorated by the connecting helices (\u03b11\u20134 and \u03b71, 2) and two small \u03b2-strands (\u03b22 and \u03b211) (Fig. 1B). Three disulfide bonds stabilize the fold by connecting C383 to C407, C425 to C478, and C437 to C585 (Fig. 1B). The external receptor binding subdomain reveals a four-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet with three large strands (\u03b26, \u03b28, and \u03b29) and one small strand (\u03b27) between strands \u03b25 and \u03b210 of the core domain (Fig. 1B). The \u03b25/6, \u03b27/8 and \u03b29/10 intervening loops touch the core subdomain and anchor the external to the core (Fig. 1B). There is a long loop containing \u03b73 crosses perpendicular to the \u03b2 sheet connecting \u03b27 and \u03b28 strands, and a disulfide bond between C503 and C526 links the \u03b73 helix to strand \u03b26 (Fig. 1B).",

Mou et al18 revealed that MERS-CoV RBD can efficiently elicit neutralizing antibodies. Besides, previous studies have shown that the related RBD of SARS-CoV strongly reacts with antisera from patients with SARS and the depletion of the RBD-specific antibodies results in significant elimination of the neutralizing activity.28 Lu et al2 also proposed that SARS vaccines based on SARS-CoV RBD are more effective and safer than vaccine candidates based on the inactivated virus, DNA or viral vectors. In addition, Zhu et al29 even proposed to design an RBD-based vaccine against MERS-CoV following an experimental path the same as that of the RBD-based SARS vaccine. Therefore, we strongly believe that MERS-CoV RBD is an important candidate target for developing MERS vaccines.",

With that, virtual screening (VS) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) can be implemented to find candidate drugs from molecular databases such as ZINC, PubChem, DrugBank, and so on.30, 31, 32 The structural comparison between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV RBDs shows that although their core subdomains are homologous and similar in structure, their receptor binding subdomains are clearly different. Thus, the core subdomain is an effective candidate target not only for anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics, but also for anti-Betacoronavirus treatments.15\n",

In practice, the current situation is not so bad. Lu et al15 found that although the engagement of the receptor does not induce significant conformational changes in receptor binding motifs, the \u03b72-\u03b14 loop in the RBD core exhibits a surprisingly large conformational difference between the free and the bounded conditions (Fig. 2\nA). That is to say the RBD\u2013DPP4 interaction is largely dependent on the conformational variant of the loop. Therefore, utilizing ligands binding to that region, we can interfere with the essential conformational change, consequently preventing MERS-CoV infection. With the help of PocketPicker, a ligand pocket detection tool, we found computationally that the correct binding pocket of MERS-CoV RBD with a buried and a solvent exposed part is close to the loop (Fig. 2B).33 Therefore, the \u03b72-\u03b14 loop and its peripheral region are important for VS and SBDD to find novel efficient antiviral drugs.",
