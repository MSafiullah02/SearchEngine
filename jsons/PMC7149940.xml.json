Humans acquire infection through the bite of infected rodent fleas, by handling or ingesting infected animal tissues, or by inhaling contagious airborne particles. Most human infections occur in rural areas of the developing world, where sanitation is poor and humans live in close association with rodent reservoirs. The principal clinical forms of plague are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic and septicemic plague account for approximately 80% and 15% of primary cases, respectively. Pneumonic plague can occur as a primary infection but more often develops as a complication of bubonic or septicemic plague. All forms of plague can be cured if diagnosed and treated promptly; however, even short delays can lead to overwhelming endotoxemia, organ failure, and death.",

The \u201cJustinian\u201d pandemic began in the mid sixth century ad and killed an estimated 40 million persons while spreading from central Africa to the Mediterranean, Europe, and Asia Minor. The second pandemic began in the fourteenth century in Central Asia and traveled along caravan routes to reach the Near and Middle East. Entering Messina by ship in 1347, the \u201cBlack Death\u201d spread swiftly through Europe and the British Isles. Although some historians contend that this rapid advance suggests an alternative etiology,1 recent evidence from archeological and transmission studies strongly supports the role of Y. pestis as the cause of the Black Death.\n2, 3, 4 Medieval plague persisted in Europe for several centuries and is thought to have killed a quarter or more of some affected populations.",

It struck Hong Kong and from there spread by rat-infested steamships to port cities throughout the world, including several in the United States. 5, 6, 7 It was in Hong Kong that Alexandre Yersin established the etiology of plague by isolating the plague bacillus from enlarged lymph nodes of plague victims in 1894.8 Four years later in Bombay, Paul-Louis Simond identified the plague bacillus in the tissues of dead rats; he subsequently proposed that rat fleas transmitted the bacillus from rat to rat, and from rats to humans. Within 30 years of its appearance, the third plague pandemic resulted in 26 million human cases and more than 12 million deaths, most of them in India.5\n",

Y. pestis did, however, become newly established among urban and rural rodent populations in many previously unaffected areas of the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia, resulting in scattered zoonotic foci that still exist throughout the world.9, 10 In San Francisco, between 1900 and 1908, major outbreaks of rat-borne plague killed more than 200 persons. By 1908, plague was epizootic among ground squirrels in counties surrounding the city,7 and in subsequent years spread to wild rodent populations throughout California and other states in the western third of the country. The last outbreak of urban plague and of person-to-person pneumonic transmission in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924\u20131925. By the middle of the twentieth century, cities in the United States and elsewhere had enforced higher sanitary standards and building codes, effective insecticides and rodenticides had become widely available, and several classes of antibiotics had been shown to be efficacious in treating plague. Most human plague since then has been sporadic and rural in distribution. Outbreaks have been relatively slow to develop and readily controlled by a combination of surveillance, early diagnosis and treatment, and flea and rat suppression.11 The major exceptions to this generalization were the large rat-borne plague epidemics that occurred from 1962 to 1975 in war-torn Vietnam and in the 1990s in Madagascar.12, 13\n",

Y. pestis grows slowly but well on a wide variety of common media (e.g., brain-heart infusion broth, sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar). Growth occurs across a wide range of temperatures (4\u201340\u00b0C) and pH (5.0\u20139.6), but is optimal at 28\u00b0C and pH 7.4. In the environment, Y. pestis is rapidly killed by temperatures above 40\u00b0C and by desiccation. Incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours on agar yields pinpoint, transparent colonies that are easily overlooked, especially if there is contamination of the culture by other bacteria. At 48 hours, colonies are typically gray, 1\u20132 mm in diameter, and have an irregular \u201chammered metal\u201d appearance when viewed under magnification. In broth, Y. pestis grows in flocculent clumps, typically attached to the sides of the tube in downwardly projecting stalactite forms that leave a clear broth. With polychromatic stains such as Wayson, Wright, or Giemsa, plague bacilli from clinical specimens demonstrate a characteristic bipolar appearance resembling closed safety pins (Fig. 41.1\n). Although not truly encapsulated, Y. pestis produces an envelope that contains the unique fraction 1 (F1) glycoprotein surface antigen. Diagnostic specimens can be safely handled under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) procedures, but manipulation of isolates requires BSL-3 measures to adequately protect laboratory workers.16\n",

            "text": "Genomic studies suggest that the plague bacillus evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis as recently as 1500 to 20 000 years ago.17, 18, 19 This transition from enteric to flea-borne pathogen was made possible by the acquisition of several virulence factors that allow survival in rodents, humans, and fleas.6, 20, 21, 22 Most of these virulence factors are encoded on three plasmids, of approximate sizes 9.5, 70, and 110 kb. The 9.5 kb plasmid (pPCP1) encodes a bacteriocin (pesticin) that promotes iron uptake and a temperature-dependent plasminogen activator (Pla). At ambient temperatures, the plasminogen activator protease facilitates the formation of a bolus of blood and aggregated bacteria in the flea midgut, which blocks the flea's proventriculus and leads to regurgitation of infective material when the \u201cblocked\u201d flea attempts to feed. The 70 kb plasmid (pCD1 or pLcr) encodes gene products active in low calcium environments. These products include Yersinia outer surface proteins (Yops) and soluble V antigen, thought to be essential to Y. pestis survival in macrophages. The Yop virulon includes a type III secretory system that injects Yop effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. These factors downregulate the immune response of macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells, and induce apoptosis by blocking signaling pathways.23 The 110 kDa plasmid (pFra or pMT1) contains genes for the F1 envelope glycoprotein antigen and a murine exotoxin. F1 antigen is produced only by organisms growing at 30\u00b0C or greater. Y. pestis strains expressing F1 antigen are able to resist phagocytosis in the absence of opsonizing antibodies. The murine toxin (Ymt) is highly toxic to mice and rats, but is not known to be toxic in humans. In the flea midgut, Ymt plays a critical role in protecting Y. pestis from a cytotoxic digestion product of blood plasma.",

            "text": "Plague foci are distributed throughout the world (Fig. 41.2\n) and involve a diverse array of host and vector species10, 26, 27, 28, 29 (Box 41.1\n). Transmission among rodents and fleas is often described in terms of enzootic and epizootic cycles (Fig. 41.3\n).10, 27, 28 Enzootic cycles help sustain the organism over time and involve relatively resistant rodent species living in remote, sparsely populated areas. In enzootic cycles, infection spreads slowly, mortality among rodent populations is unremakable, and the risk of human infection is generally low. In contrast, epizootic cycles are characterized by rapid transmission among highly susceptible rodent hosts, resulting in mass die-offs of rodent populations and accelerated dispersal of infected fleas. Epizootics among rodent populations living in close proximity to humans pose an increased risk of human infection. Of particular concern are epizootics involving the commensal black and Norwegian rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus) and their highly efficient rat flea vectors (Xenopsylla cheopis and X. braziliensis).5, 10, 11 These species are adapted to live intimately with humans and historically are thought to have played an important role in pandemic spread of plague.Box 41.1Plague FociNorth American Plague FociWild rodent plague has been reported west of the 100th meridian in 17 contiguous western states and in some areas of adjacent Canada and Mexico.9, 30 The major plague sites are the southwestern focus, comprising mainly semi-arid grassland plateaus, foothills, and forested uplands of northeastern Arizona, most of New Mexico, southern Utah, and southern Colorado; the Pacific Coast focus, comprising mostly valley grassland, foothills, and the montane habitat of California and southern Oregon; the Great Basin focus, encompassing parts of Utah, Nevada, and southern Idaho; and the Rocky Mountain and northern focus, comprising mostly northern Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.9, 29 The principal rodent hosts in the southwestern focus are various burrowing ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), prairie dogs (primarily Cynomys gunnisoni), wood rats (Neotoma spp.), antelope ground squirrels (Ammospermophilus spp.), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and related species. The major rodent hosts in the various niches of the Pacific Coast focus include Spermophilus spp., especially the California ground squirrel (S. beecheyi), the golden-mantled ground squirrel (S. lateralis), chipmunks (various Tamias spp.), deer mice and other Peromyscus spp., and voles (Microtus spp.). Other important hosts in the United States include various small ground squirrels (S. elegans, S. beldingi, and S. townsendi) in the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin regions, and the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) in the Great Plains region. Epizootics of plague have recently occurred in urban tree squirrel (Sciurus niger) populations in cities along the eastern foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, but pose a small risk to humans because these squirrels are parasitized by nonanthropophagic fleas. Since 1950, a few cities in the United States have rarely been found to have Y. pestis-infected rats (e.g., Tacoma, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas). However, no widespread epizootics or human plague cases have resulted, possibly because the rats have been infested with only small numbers of fleas or with flea species that are inefficient vectors of Y. pestis. The principal fleas transmitting plague among wild rodent epizootic hosts in the United States include various ground squirrel fleas (Oropsylla montana (Diamanus montanus), Hoplopsyllus anomalus, Thrassis spp., Opisocrostis spp., Oropsylla idahoensis), prairie dog fleas (Opisocrostis spp.), wood rat fleas (Orchopeas spp.), and chipmunk fleas (Eumolpianus eumolpi).9, 29\nO. montana is the most important vector of Y. pestis to persons in the United States because it is a competent host that readily feeds on a wide range of rodents, and on other mammals, including humans.South American Plague FociIn South America, active enzootic plague foci exist in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, and have been described previously in Paraguay, Argentina, and Venezuela. Y. pestis infection in these foci has been variously found in commensal rats (Rattus spp.), cotton rats (Sigmodon spp.), rice rats (Oryzomys spp.), field mice (Akodon spp.), cane mice (Zygodontomys spp.), wild cavies, and domesticated guinea pigs (Cavia and Galea spp.).5, 28 Domestic guinea pigs are reared in homes for food in the Andean region and are considered a potential commensal risk of infection to humans; human plague outbreaks in the Andean region, including a recent extensive bubonic plague epidemic in northern Peru and a mixed bubonic/pneumonic plague outbreak in Ecuador, have been suspected to be associated in the domestic environment with infected guinea pigs as well as R. rattus. A previously active plague area in northeastern Brazil has been quiescent over the past 20 years. The various fleas that serve as principal vectors in South American foci are X. cheopis on Rattus spp. and Polygenis and Pleochaetis spp. on wild rodents. Pulex irritans, the human flea (which also parasitizes domesticated guinea pigs), has been implicated as a potential transmitter of plague to humans in some Andean outbreaks.African Plague FociWidely scattered active plague foci exist in East and southern Africa, including Democratic Republic of the Congo (previously Zaire), Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, and Angola, and on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar.5, 10, 28, 31 Less active foci exist in some northern African states (e.g., Libya, Algeria). The principal wild rodent hosts in Africa include gerbils (Tatera and Desmodillus spp.), swamp rats (Otomys spp.), various grass mice (Arvicanthis spp.), multimammate rats (Mastomys spp.), and commensal rats (Rattus spp.). One scenario describes plague in grassland gerbil populations spreading to multimammate rats in agricultural fields, and then to commensal rats in villages, resulting in human plague outbreaks. The principal flea vectors of wild rodent hosts are Xenopsylla and Dinopsyllus spp., while X. cheopis and X. braziliensis are the principal flea species involved in transmission among commensal rats and to humans.Asian Plague FociThe most important Eurasian plague hosts are gerbils (various Meriones spp.) in Iran, Kurdistan, Transcaucasia, other areas around the Caspian Sea, and the plains of southeastern Russia and Kazakhstan; marmots (Marmota spp.) in Central Asia, including mountainous Khazakstan, northeastern China, Mongolia, Manchuria, and in Transbaikalia; and ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) in Mongolia, northern-central China, the central Asian plains and steppes, and some areas around the Caspian Sea.5, 10, 28 The primary flea vectors on gerbils are Xenopsylla and Nosopsyllus spp.; on marmots, various Oropsylla, Rhadinopsylla, and Citellophilus spp.; and on ground squirrels, Citellophilus and Neopsylla spp.In India, the gerbil, Tatera indica, has been described as the principal wild rodent maintenance host.5, 10, 28 Although it lives principally in open grassland sites in its natural state, it does invade agricultural fields and village peripheries. Other maintenance hosts include Mellardia meltada, various field mice, and palm squirrels (Funambulus spp.). The important commensal rat species are Bandicota bengalensis, B. indica, R. rattus, and R. norvegicus. Investigations in Maharashtra in western-central India suggest that Y. pestis may spread from reservoir gerbil populations in open grasslands to peridomestic R. rattus populations through intermediary populations of bandicoot rats (B. bengalensis). The primary vectors of plague in India are X. cheopis and X. astia.\nThe principal rodent hosts in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia are R. rattus subsp. diardii and the Polynesian rat (R. exulans).5, 10, 28\nR. rattus subsp. flavipectus is an important host in southern China. R. norvegicus and the bandicoot B. indicus have been described as important hosts in Vietnam. The shrew, Suncus murinus, has been described as a possibly important host of plague in Vietnam and Indonesia. X. cheopis is the principal vector of plague in southern China, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia; X. astia (a less efficient vector) is also found on rats in Myanmar and Vietnam. Stivalius cognatus, a rat flea, is considered to be an important secondary vector of plague in Indonesia.",

The risk of human infection varies with environmental circumstances and human behaviors. Low socioeconomic status is an important risk factor because infestation by rats and their fleas is associated with poor housing and unsanitary conditions. In addition, humans may be exposed through contact with other, incidentally infected domestic and wild mammals. Cats are highly susceptible to plague and can transmit infection to humans through respiratory secretions, resulting in primary pneumonic plague.32, 33 Dogs are relatively resistant to illness but may still play a role in human infection by transporting rodent fleas into the domestic environment.34 For example, a recent study in New Mexico found that plague patients were significantly more likely than controls to have allowed dogs to sleep on their bed at night.35 Hunters may become infected through direct inoculation while skinning or otherwise handling carcasses of infected rodents, rabbits and hares, domestic and wild felids, and coyotes.10, 32, 36 This is a particular risk among marmot hunters in Mongolia and northeastern China.37 Direct inoculation is associated with an increased risk of septicemia and a high fatality rate. Ungulates, including antelope, deer, camels, dromedaries, and goats, are also susceptible to plague; handling and ingesting undercooked meat of these animals has been responsible for limited human plague outbreaks in northern Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.38 Once infected, humans with pneumonic plague pose a risk for person-to-person transmission, a risk that is enhanced in the cramped living quarters of nomadic hunters and impoverished populations.",

Following the extraordinary epidemics of pneumonic plague involving tens of thousands of cases in Manchuria in the period 1910\u20131926, pneumonic plague outbreaks around the world have occurred only sporadically, usually involving three or fewer generations of cases, and typically affecting family members, close friends, and care providers of pneumonic plague patients.

The femoral and inguinal groups of nodes are most commonly involved, followed by the axillary and cervical nodes. Upper body sites may be relatively more involved in children than adults. The enlarging bubo(es) becomes progressively swollen, painful, and tender, and the patient typically guards against palpation and limits movement. The surrounding tissue often becomes edematous, and the overlying skin may be erythematous, warm, and tense, and may desquamate (Fig. 41.4\n). Inspection of the skin surrounding or distal to the bubo sometimes reveals the site of a flea bite marked by a small papule, pustule, scab, or ulcer. Larger pustular lesions (furuncles or carbuncles), ulcers, and eschars may rarely occur and can be confused with those caused by tularemia or anthrax. Treated in the uncomplicated state with an appropriate antibiotic, bubonic plague usually responds quickly, with disappearance of fever and resolution of other systemic manifestations over 2\u20135 days. Buboes often remain enlarged and tender for a week or more after treatment has begun and can occasionally become fluctuant. Without effective antimicrobial treatment, bubonic plague may progress to an increasingly toxic state of fever, tachycardia, lethargy, agitation and, occasionally, convulsions and delirium. Plague patients typically have white blood cell counts of 12 000\u201325 000/\u00b5L, with a predominance of immature polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukemoid reactions showing white blood cell counts as high as 50 000/\u00b5L or more can occur.45 Mild forms of bubonic plague, called pestis minor, have been described in South America and elsewhere; in these cases, the patients are ambulatory, only mildly febrile, and have subacute buboes. Differential diagnostic possibilities for bubonic plague include streptococcal or staphylococcal adenitis, tularemia, cat-scratch disease, mycobacterial infection, acute filarial lymphadenitis, chancroid and other sexually transmitted diseases that cause regional lymphadenitis, and strangulated inguinal hernia. The bubo of plague is usually distinguishable from lymphadenitis of most other causes by its rapid onset, extreme tenderness, accompanying signs of toxemia, and usual absence of cellulitis or obvious ascending lymphangitis.",

The plasmids conferring resistance in these two strains are believed to have arisen independently, possibly through horizontal gene transfer in the flea midgut.58 In the absence of antimicrobial pressure on wild rodent populations, it is questionable whether such resistance would be expected to propagate in nature.
