Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer.",

Spike glycoprotein exists as a homotrimeric complex on the viral membrane of coronaviruses 7 . Each spike monomer contains an S1 subunit and an S2 subunit 8 . The S1 subunit binds to ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to initiate cell recognition, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the spike protein to the viral envelope and responds to S1-induced cell recognition to mediate effective membrane fusion via a conformational transition 7 . These determined infection mechanisms indicated that blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 would cause a direct neutralizing effect against virus.",

An alternative approach is to clone the neutralizing antibody from the isolated SARS-CoV-2-RBD-specific single B cells from infected patients 11, 12 .

Since the extended RBD presents a complete exposed ACE2 interface that would be more easily captured by an antibody than the closed RBD, we simply wondered whether the remaining embedded ACE2 interfaces of both the open and closed spike trimers could be accessed by antibody. Because the reported cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer lacks some RBD residue information, we replaced its RBD with the determined structure of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to establish the remodeled SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. We then analyzed the interspace between each embedded ACE2 interface and its neighboring monomer. The three interspaces in the closed trimer were quite uniform (from 17.2 \u00c5 to 19.5 \u00c5). For the two interspaces of the open trimer, one did not change (19.5 \u00c5), whereas the other was somehow occupied by the extended RBD (11.2 \u00c5) ( Figure 6A ). The domain antibody exhibited a relatively smaller size and antigen interface because it contains only a heavy chain variable region with three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) instead of six in IgG ( Figure 6B ). We then performed molecular docking to compare the binding patterns of 4A3 scFv and the domain antibodies on our remodeled spike trimers. Both 4A3 and the domain antibodies were predicted to recognize all three ACE2 interfaces of the closed trimer ( Figure 6C ). However, when docked with the open trimer, 4A3 scFv was predicted to target only two ACE2 interfaces. It could not access the embedded ACE2 interface occupied by the extended RBD, probably due to its larger size. Surprisingly, one of the domain antibodies, 4A12, was predicted to block all three ACE2 interfaces ( Figure 6D ).",

These results were consistent with the blocking pattern observed in the SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-CHO cell-binding assays ( Figure 4A and 4C). Although 4C5 did not show a blocking effect in our cell-binding assay, it still showed a mild neutralizing capability ( Figure 7B ).",

It has been reported that immunizing rodents with SARS-CoV-2-RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response without antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) 27 . According to the determined structure, the ACE2 interface of the RBD presents only a small portion of the whole domain 15 , and only those antibodies binding to the interface would directly interfere the interaction with ACE2. This would be one possible explanation for why not all the antibodies isolated with RBD binding activity showed neutralizing activity. Based on this information, we performed site-directed screening with the positive antigen SARS-CoV-2-RBD and negative antigen SARS-CoV-2-RBD mut to ensure that we obtained antibodies accurately targeting the ACE2 interface. As we predicted, most of our candidate antibodies exhibited a significant blocking effect for ACE2 recognition on cells ( Figure   4 ). Although the antibody 4C5 did not, it did show a relatively mild virus-neutralizing function compared to that of the other candidates (Figure 7) . These functional evaluations might prove the feasibility of our site-directed screening strategy, but further validations, such as epitope determination by cryo-EM, are still necessary.",

We initially obtained ten enriched binders that all showed strong antigen-binding activity. However, when expressed in 293T cells, three of them lost antigen binding, and two of them exhibited poor yield. This effect is a common problem for phage display when shifting to a eukaryotic expression system. Other in vitro screening strategies, such as yeast display 43 or mammalian cell display 44 , may offer more stable selection due to their eukaryotic background. Antibodies selected from naive phage libraries usually require further optimization to improve their affinity. Even though the affinities of our antibodies are in a range (10 -9 M) similar to that of antibodies screened from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients 11 , we still need to perform affinity maturation to achieve more competitive affinity and neutralizing function against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, collecting the blood of infected donors to construct a SARS-CoV-2-specific phage library for antibody screening will be an alternative strategy as well.",

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed by GenScript (GenScript, Nanjing) to measure the affinity of the antibody. Antibodies were immobilized on the Series S Sensor Chip Protein A chip (GE Healthcare), and then SARS-CoV-2-RBD-his protein with a gradient concentration from 1.25 nM to 40 nM was injected into the chip. The analysis was performed at a constant temperature of 25 \u00b0C. The buffer was HBS-EP +: 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% P20, pH 7.4 (lot No. 30393) (GE Healthcare); the flow rate was 10 \u03bcl/min. The assay was performed by Biacore T200, GR18010468 (GE Healthcare). Calculation of the combined kinetic constants was performed by Biacore T200 Evaluation software version 3.1. Pseudovirus neutralization assay. To generate SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we replaced the coding sequence of VSV-G protein with the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike in lentiviral packaging system 19,20 and then co-transfect HEK293T cells with the pLVX-EGFP-Luciferase reporter gene. The pseudovirus supernatant was collected 48 h later and titrated to 10 5 pfu/ml. Neutralization assays were performed by incubating pseudovirus with a series of diluted antibodies at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, the pseudovirusantibody mixture was added to seeded ACE2-CHO cells (approximately 5\u00d710 3 pfu vs 10 4 cells/well) in 96-well plates.

            "text": "The structural transition from the closed to open state of the RBD has been proven necessary for receptor engagement and membrane fusion in coronaviruses 31,32 . Therefore, blocking all the RBDs, especially all the ACE2 interfaces of both open and closed spike trimers, by antibodies would theoretically offer enhanced protection against virus infection. It seemed that one of our domain antibodies, 4A12, might execute its neutralizing function in this way, but additional structural evidence is needed. These observations also suggest that the neutralizing mechanism of antibody should be evaluated on both SARS-CoV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Because a recent study reports that the neutralizing activity of CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody, is lost on SARS-CoV-2 due to the different conformation characters of spike trimer 33 . On the other hand, a smaller size causes a shorter half-life of the domain antibody in vivo 34,35 , which might be a potential disadvantage for its neutralizing function. However, one of the major safety concerns of coronavirus vaccines is the undesirable ADE induced by anti-spike antibodies 36,37 . Although several studies have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies seem less likely to induce ADE than nonneutralizing antibodies 38-40 , we could not exclude possible ADE since there is still no available clinical result for either a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or neutralizing antibody.In this case, a domain antibody with a shorter half-life would be a possible choice to balance neutralization and ADE side effects.",
