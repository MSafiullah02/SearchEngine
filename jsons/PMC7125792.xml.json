This organism is one of the three human pathogenic species, including Y. pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica, in the genus Yersinia\n[1]. Plague occurs predominantly in three different forms, that is, bubonic, pneumonic, and septicaemic, depending on the route of exposure to the pathogen. Bubonic plague usually involves one group of lymph nodes, contracted following the bite by a flea that has previously fed on an infected rodent and developed a blocked proventriculus, and the infection can spread to the lungs (pneumonic plague) when the suitable treatment is not administered in time. Septicaemic plague is the result of haematogenous dissemination of the bacteria from a bubo. Pneumonic plague can also be transmitted by airborne droplets. The infection takes place within a few hours and causes bronchopneumonia. What is more, the Y. pestis is the most dangerous bacterial agent that could potentially be used for biological warfare or bioterrorism [2].",

The rapid detection of Y. pestis is critical for controlling the spread of plague. The laboratory detection of Y. pestis is based on bacteriological, serological and nucleic acid-based methods [1]. The bacterial culture is not well suitable for rapid detection of Y. pestis due to the time delay. The passive haemagglutination assay (PHA), which is used to detect Y. pestis-specific antibodies, has repeatedly shown to lack sensitivity and specificity [4]. Therefore, rapid and sensitive assays are desirable for the detection of Y. pestis, its specific antigens or nucleic acid sequences. At present, sensitive PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based detection methods have been described to identify Y. pestis\n[5], [6], [7]. Especially, real-time PCR is highly specific and less prone to cross-contamination [8]. Although offering reasonable sensitivity, these assays are time consuming (include both DNA/RNA preparation and the longer detection procedure), and not readily available for on-site detection. Detection of F1 capsular antigen (F1 CA) of Y. pestis by immunoassay methods such as immunogold chromatographic dipstick assay and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) has been developed [9], [10].",

Now, it has been surging in infectious disease diagnostics [12], [13]. Jung et al. developed a colloidal gold particles-based LF strip for detecting Escherichia coli O157 at a minimum of 1.8 \u00d7 105\n CFU/ml [22]. LF procedure utilizes the specific interaction between antigens and antibodies and provides rapid detection of various analytes. In the field of biomedical diagnostics, the search for the increased detection sensitivity and the possibility of quantitative detection using simple inexpensive assays is an ongoing challenge. In this respect, LF assays have become the popular diagnostic tools in a variety of settings because they are sensitive, simple to perform, inexpensive to manufacture, and perhaps most important, well suitable for rapid on-site detection and can be carried out nearly anywhere by non-technical personnel [14].",

Firstly, UPT particles were coated with a thin layer of silica by using TEOS. Then the silica-coated surface of UPT particles can be functionalized with amino-, aldehyde-functional groups using APES, polyoxyethylene bis-amino and glutaraldehyde, respectively. Eventually these aldehyde-functionalized UPT particles can be conjugated to the antibody directly in a 4 \u00b0C-prechilled Na2CO3\u2013NaHCO3 buffer (50 mM, pH 9.5) under stirring. Uncoupled antibodies to the UPT particles were separated from the conjugated ones by a series of washing steps involving centrifugation and resuspension of pelleted UPT particles in a phosphate buffer of 30 mM pH 7.2.

Fig. 3\nillustrates a design of the UPT-based biosensor, which is similar, at least partly, to what was presented by Zijlmans et al. and Niedbala et al. [19], [20]. The mainboard PC104 installed inside the biosensor was used instead of the accessory computer to control the whole system and the convenient Windows 98 system was employed as the platform to support the running of biosensor software programmed by us. Therefore, just equipped with the keyboard and mouse, the UPT-based biosensor can work independently, and the user can accomplish the scanning process just by pressing the icons displayed on the LCD of biosensor. During detection, firstly the strip was inserted in the biosensor and put on the stage, and then PC104 through multifunction DAS (Data Acquisition Station) card made the laser diode emit the infrared light with wavelength about 980 nm. This light irradiated on the dichroic mirror A, and a part of this light passed through it to the photodiode and gave an electric signal to collimate the instability of the system. The rest light was refracted and irradiated on the dichroic mirror B. This dichroic mirror made the infrared light refracted totally on the focusing lens A and through it focused on the strip. UPT particles on the strip were excited by this infrared light and then emitted visible light with wavelength about 541 nm. This visible light through focusing lens A irradiated on the dichroic mirror B and was transmitted completely. After filtrated away the light with other wavelength by a filter, the visible light emitted by UPT particles was focused on the PMT and gave multiplied voltage (relative fluorescence unit) as a signal. At the ending of data collection on this point, the stage held the strip to slide along X-axis to the next point of the nitrocellulose membrane and then another data-collecting process began. In the whole process of strip-scanning, the biosensor set 50 data-collecting points per millimeter of the nitrocellulose membrane, that is, 2000 points per strip. Therefore, the integrated scanning curve representing the diffusion of UCP particles on the nitrocellulose membrane was obtained. Voltage unit was plotted against the strip length increment to identify the height of peaks.",

The raw data (data not shown) and background subtraction data (Fig. 4\n) could be obtained by the UPT-based biosensor. The first peak (C) and the second peak (T) in Fig. 4 displayed the multiplied voltage units for the control and the test line, respectively, as plotted in Y-axis. The distance from the scanning window of cartridge was plotted in X-axis. It should note that absolute values of these signals depend on the physical properties of test strips and the photomultiplier tube used for detection and cannot necessarily be used to compare data from different experiments [15]. The variability observed from strip to strip at the same cell concentration attributes to variations in membrane properties, humidity effects, batch to batch variability of the phosphor conjugates, storage conditions, and many other factors. So the data were treated by using the formula (V\nt\n \u2212 \nV\nB)/(V\nc\n \u2212 \nV\nB), where V\nt represented the multiplied voltage units for the test line signal, V\nB for the background signal, and V\nc for the control line signal.

In order to get the quantitative result, the ratio V\nT/V\nC was treated as the final result for each assay. The mean ratio of the V\nT/V\nC values corresponding to serial dilutions of bacterial samples ranging from 101 to 108\n CFU/ml was plotted against the logarithmic cell number (CFU/ml). The cut-off value of the current assay was calculated as the mean ratio (V\nT/V\nC) of the blank controls plus three standard deviations, which corresponded to 99% confidence.

            "text": "This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining a UPT-based biosensor with an LF immunoassay to create a rapid, on-site testing method for quantitative detection of the whole cells of Y. pestis. We developed and evaluated this assay by using pure cultures of Y. pestis EV76 as a model. By using a sandwich format, we observed a good linearity between the signal ratio (V\nT/V\nC) and log CFU/ml of Y. pestis above the detection limit, which was approximately 104\n CFU/ml. So the quantitative detection of Y. pestis could be easily achieved by the UPT-LF and it was confirmed by applying it to testing the lung tissue homogenates from the experimentally infected Balb/c mice by Y. pestis. The precision of the intra- and inter-assay was below 15% (coefficient of variation, CV). The specificity of this assay was also satisfactory because no cross-reactivity with related Gram-negative enteric bacteria was found. Furthermore, 104 to 108\n CFU/ml of Y. pestis could be specifically and sensitively detected when 108\n CFU/ml of Y. pseudotuberculosis were mixed together in the sample. The assay, which does not need washing and incubation steps, can be completed within 30 min.",

The method described here is rapid, specific and sensitive; and it has the potential to be optimized for greater sensitivity for on-site detection. Therefore, the described method can be used for detection and monitoring of plague in combination of an LF immunoassay and a UPT-based biosensor. Moreover, the UPT-LF assay strips can be easily adapted for detecting other microorganisms, as we have applied this assay to detection of E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus anthracis spores and SARS-CoV etc.",
