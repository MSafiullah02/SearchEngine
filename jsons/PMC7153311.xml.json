            "text": "Biosensors, analytical devices incorporating a biological material (e.g., tissue, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.), a biologically derived material (e.g., recombinant antibodies, engineered proteins, aptamers, etc.), or a biomimic (e.g., synthetic receptors, biomimetic catalysts, combinatorial ligands, imprinted polymers, etc.) intimately associated with or integrated within a physicochemical transducer or transducing microsystem, which may be optical, electrochemical, thermometric, piezoelectric, magnetic, or micromechanical [1], have become a very important area of Analytical Chemistry. The majority of current and future analytical requirements will be solved by the use of simple yet sensitive devices, able to be reshaped with new trends such as the integration with, e.g., smartphones [2]. Apart from the well-established enzymatic sensors, the selectivity of affinity interactions, such as those of antigen\u2013antibody or nucleic acid hybridization, is exploited for the respective development of promising immune and nucleic acid assays. Nucleic acid detection is becoming relevant not only in the field of food analysis but also in clinical diagnosis. It is advantageous compared with immunoassay in cases of recent infection or underlying immunodeficiency. Moreover, it is very useful for treatment monitoring because elimination of nucleic acids coming from a pathogen indicates successful handling [3].",

            "text": "Electrochemical biosensors combine the sensitivity of electroanalytical methods with the inherent bioselectivity of the biological component [4]. In DNA sensors, several alternative ways of detecting DNA electrochemically (direct or indirectly) are possible. The intrinsic electroactivity of adenine and guanine can be the basis for direct measurement of nucleic acids\n[5]. On the other hand, the use of indicator molecules that interact differentially with single- or double-stranded DNA has been widely exploited in indirect approaches. Bioconjugation is commonly not required because electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions take place easily. A different possibility for indirect detection is the use of enzymes, alternative that enhances assay sensitivity enormously because of their inherent amplification. Although enzymes can be directly conjugated to DNA strands, the use of a well-known affinity interaction such as avidin\u2013biotin is an easy alternative. Horseradish peroxidase has been widely used as enzyme label as well as glucose oxidase and alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP (EC 3.1.3.1) is a hydrolase that converts orthophosphoric monoesters into alcohols and thus various phosphate esters can act as substrates. As the name suggests, they are more effective in alkaline media. 3-Indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) has been proposed as an adequate substrate for AP in immunoelectrochemical approaches [6]. Because of its satisfactory electrochemical behavior (see Chapters 5, 30, and 31Chapter 5Chapter 30Chapter 31), it has been used for the development of AP-based enzyme immunoassays. In this experiment, AP is used to detect DNA hybridization events on gold electrodes.",

Gold also offers the relevant possibility of generating self-assembled DNA monolayers through thiol groups because of the strong binding between sulfur and gold, which may be considered almost covalent.",

The following points should be beard in mind:1.In the introduction, explain the purpose of the experiment and do a short review of the methods described to tackle this problem.2.Protocols must be suitably detailed including schemes preferentially where appropriate and the necessary calculations.3.Discuss the main variables that influence the analytical signals and include figures with representative raw data and results presented in tables and graphs for optimization studies.4.Include graphs for the calibration curve, discussing the values obtained for the figures of merit. Pay attention to the significant figures in each case.5.Indicate and comment in case the results obtained in terms of selectivity (see additional note number 8) and precision.6.Discuss the incidences during the course of the experiment.\n",

They must be protected from light and kept refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. Working solutions must be prepared daily.3.3-IP solutions must be prepared daily and kept at 4\u00b0C, protected from light.4.AP-labeled St aliquots must be prepared and maintained at \u221220\u00b0C; working solutions are conserved at 4\u00b0C.5.A drop of 5 \u03bcL and a strand concentration of 1 \u03bcM are employed in the immobilization steps (step 1 in Section 21.5.1), but both variables could be varied to study their influence.\n6.The blocking of the active surface remaining after immobilization is very important in bioassays. Different agents could be checked, as commented in Section 24.5.2. The influence of different concentrations could also be evaluated.7.SWV is employed for measurement because it is a fast and sensitive electrochemical technique. However, cyclic voltammetry or differential pulse voltammetry could also be evaluated. In particular, cyclic voltammetry should be made initially to know the electrochemical behavior and processes of 3-IP.8.Selectivity of the genosensor can be studied by evaluating the signal of a, e.g., 3-base mismatch strand: 5\u2032-ACA-GCG-CCT-AAA-AAC-GAC-AAA-AAG-AG-AAG-3\u2032-biotin. Mismatches are located in base numbers 5, 15, and 26. It is also biotinylated at the 3\u2032-end to allow hybridization detection by interaction with AP-labeled St. Adding agents that increase stringency (e.g., 50% of formamide) should be considered.9.The sensitivity could be improved using different conditions (drop volume, time of the different steps, buffer composition, etc. [7]). Students are encouraged to discuss and evaluate the different variables.10.In this case, a proof of concept of a biosensor able to detect SARS DNA is presented. The target is labeled with biotin. Then, in a real assay, DNA would have to be amplified using biotinylated primers. Alternatively, a sandwich format (thiolated capture probe\u2013target\u2013biotinylated detection probe) should be employed.\n",
