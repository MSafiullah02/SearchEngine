            "text": "Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to early recognition of epidemic diseases, environmental contamination or viral bioterrorist attack. Rapid detection and identification of pathogens are critically important not only to minimize transfer and spread of disease but also to devise and evaluate effective treatment strategies. The standard laboratory diagnostic test for viruses is based on their culture (Henderson et al., 1999), which is very sensitive but cumbersome and time-consuming. Labeling methods such as fluorescent technique, electrochemiluminescence and immunosorbent assays occasionally results in false positives or a high percentage of false negatives (Long et al., 2004, Wang and Jin, 2004, Wu et al., 2004). Label-free methods such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), magnetic bead cell sorting, atomic force microscope (AFM), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are advantageous in that the detection protocols are simplified through removing the need to label secondary antibodies (Bisoffi et al., 2008, Nettikadan et al., 2003, Oh et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2004, Porter and Pickup, 1998, Uttenthaler et al., 2001). However, some of them need expensive equipment, associated specialist skills and complicated sample preparation process. For example, AFM and PCR needs relatively expensive equipment and associated specialist skills to perform the analysis. SPR is confined to gold-thiols self-assembly in the analysis. In order to avoid the problems, there is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive testing, multiplex and simple operation for virus detection.",

The avidin (0.5 mg/ml, 10 \u03bcl, passing the surface at 2 \u03bcl/min) could be covalently immobilized on the modified substrate due to the reaction of Schiff base with \u2013CHO. The areas were rinsed with deionized water, and each area was then blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA for 40 min. When the areas were blocked, 0.1 mg/ml bio-GP3 was added (10 \u03bcl, 2 \u03bcl/min). Because bio-GP3 on these areas could specifically identify minor coat protein pIII on the head of phage M13KO7, some identical immune-probes of phage M13KO7 were formed, which were capable of detecting separate samples simultaneously.",

The incident wave of polarized light irradiates the sample as probe beam and is thereby modified, which makes the reflective or transmission beam carry sample information, such as protein layer thickness. When imaging ellipsometry is used to detect layer thickness, the reflection intensity is represented by gray-scale. Variation of layer thickness leads to change of gray-scale value. Suppose the refractive index is invariant, the gray-scale value is directly proportional to the square of the protein layer thickness in the range of 0\u201330 nm layer thickness, i.e. I\n = \nkd\n2, where I is the light intensity and d is the layer thickness (Arwin et al., 1993). Under the same conditions for protein and ellipsometry, k is constant and can be determined from a protein layer with known gray-scale and known thickness (Arwin et al., 1993). On the other hand, there is a relation between surface concentration and film thickness: surface concentration (\u03bcg/cm2) \u2248K\n \u00d7 \nd, where K\n = 0.12 (Stenberg and Nygren, 1983, Ying et al., 2004). And thus the gray-scale value reflects directly the layer thickness or the surface concentration. The higher the gray-scale value, the thicker the layer and the higher the surface concentration.",

The particles in the image were considered to be contaminants in culture solution of phage as discussed in previous studies (Ji et al., 1998, Nettikadan et al., 2003). Furthermore, the phage detection results of BIE (Fig. 5A) was shown in Fig. 5B and C, where no filamentous phage was observed on the area of antibody bio-GP3 (Fig. 5B) and the data were listed in Table 2\n. The filamentous phage in Fig. 5C was highly consistent with the size and topography shown in Fig. 4. The contaminants particles (shown in Fig. 4) were sparse on the sensing surface with antibody bio-GP3 (shown in Fig. 5C), and cause trivial variation of surface concentration in BIE test. The variation of BIE signal was arising from a large amount of filamentous phage captured by bio-GP3 (Fig. 5C) rather than the sparse contaminants. The molecule of GP3 was similar to an oval oblate sphere (its diameter is about 95 nm and height is about 1.7 nm), whereas phages M13KO7 were long filaments (its length is about 1 \u03bcm, height is about 4.42 nm and width is about 39.21 nm). The difference between GP3 and phage M13KO7 were obvious in the two areas, and thus the detection result of BIE was confirmed by AFM.",

As a result, the Fab parts of GP3 was pointing away from the substrate so that their binding with the domain of antigen was facilitated, which can realize oriented immobilization of ligand for improving the biosensor's sensitivity.",

However, its size and structure are similar to the virus causing human disease, and thus the phage detection cannot only ensure experimenter's safety, but also help to develop BIE as a protocol and method of direct virus detection in such aspects as oriented immobilization of ligand, optimization of ligand or related biomolecule (e.g. avidin) and qualitative or quantitative detection. These methods have key significance in applying BIE to disease diagnosis, as well as serving as an earlier and biologic explanation of viruses, e.g. the detection of H5N1 avian influenza virus with BIE was reported recently (Qi et al., 2007). Therefore, this virus detection platform is highly versatile and powerful.",

            "text": "Compared with other capture techniques, two improvements of BIE are demonstrated in the present study. First, multiple detections of numerous samples can be carried out simultaneously by antibody microarray, in other words, an obvious advantage of BIE is its capability to realize parallel analysis, e.g. different batches of purified or natural samples and series of samples prepared by serial dilution could be designed and detected on a single silicon wafer. Second, an important and novel finding of the present study is BIE's ability to detect the whole virus without label, not part of it. AFM has been used to obtain high-resolution images of viruses immobilized on substrates with sensitivity 108\n pfu/ml (Ji et al., 1998, Kuznetsov et al., 2001), indicating that AFM is competent for scanning and distinguishing positive and negative areas on the substrate of biosensor. Our experiment shows that the whole phage M13KO7 is captured by the sensing surface and the finding of long phage filament is in agreement with previous studies, validating the present results of virus detection. However, some limitation of BIE is also noticeable, in particular, the sensitivity of BIE is still at a low level (109\n pfu/ml) compared with the sensitivity (108\n pfu/ml) of AFM and QCM (Nettikadan et al., 2003, Uttenthaler et al., 2001), and thus further improvement in its sensitivity is needed. Another limitation of BIE diagnosis is that it could not offer interactive microcosmic image, however this does not affect its role in virus detection, since rapid clinical diagnosis does not usually require a microcosmic image.",
