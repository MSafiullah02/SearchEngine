Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place. We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it. Our approach thus establishes a paradigm for tracing and controlling epidemic invasion and information diffusion in complex networked systems.",

Given a complex dynamical system, the various types of dynamical processes are of great interest. The ultimate goal in the study of complex systems is to devise practically implementable strategies to control the collective dynamics. A great challenge is that the network structure and the nodal dynamics are often unknown but only limited measured time series are available. To control the system dynamics, it is imperative to be able to map out the system details from data. Reconstructing complex network structure and dynamics from data, the inverse problem, has thus become a central issue in contemporary network science and engineering [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . There are broad applications of the solutions of the network reconstruction problem, due to the ubiquity of complex interacting patterns arising from many systems in a variety of disciplines [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

The past decades have witnessed severe epidemic outbreaks at the global scale due to the mutation of virus, including SARS [21, 22] , H5N1 [23, 24] , H1N1 [25, 26] and the recent invasion of H7N9 in eastern China [27, 28] . Our goal is to reconstruct the networks hosting the spreading process and identify the source of spreading using limited measurements. This is especially challenging due to (1) difficulty in predicting and monitoring mutations of deadly virus and (2) absence of epidemic threshold in heterogeneous networks [29] [30] [31] [32] . Another example is rumor propagation in the online virtual communities, which can cause financial loss or even social instabilities, such as the 2011 irrational and panicked acquisition of salt in southeast Asian countries caused by the nuclear leak in Japan. In this regard, identifying the propagation network for controlling the dynamics is of great interest. Another significant challenge in reconstructing a spreading network lies in the nature of the available time series: they are polarized, despite stochastic spreading among nodes. Indeed, the link pattern and the probability of infection are encrypted in the binary status of individuals, infected or not, analogous to the collapse of wave function to one associated with some discrete quantum state induced by observation in quantum mechanics.",

Taking into account the time delays in the diffusion process enables a straightforward inference of the source in a complex network through enumerating all possible hierarchical trees [33, 34] . However, if no immediate information about the diffusion is available, the tree-structure based inference method is inapplicable, and the problem of network reconstruction and locating the source becomes extremely challenging, hindering control of diffusion and delivery of immunization. The loss of knowledge about the source is common in real situations. For example, passengers on an international flight can carry a highly contagious disease, making certain airports the immediate neighbors of the hidden source, which would be difficult to trace. In another example, the source could be migratory birds coming from other countries or continents. A general data-driven approach, applicable in such scenarios, is still lacking.",

            "text": "In this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework to reconstruct complex propagation networks from time series based on the compressed sensing theory (CST) [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] , a novel optimization paradigm for sparse-signal reconstruction with broad applications in signal and image processing. Due to the striking characteristics of CST such as the extremely low data requirement and rigorous guarantee of convergence to optimal solutions, our framework is highly efficient and accurate. However, casting the inverse problem into the CST framework is highly nontrivial. Although CST has been used to uncover the nodal interaction patterns for coupled oscillator networks or evolutionary games from time series [41] [42] [43] , the dynamics of epidemic propagation is typically highly stochastic with, for example, binary time series, rendering inapplicable the existing CST-based formulation. Further, despite the alternative sparsity enforcing regularizers and convex optimization used in Ref. [44] to infer networks, CST has not been applied to reconstructing propagation networks, especially when the available time series are binary. The main accomplishment of this work is then the development of a scheme to implement the highly nontrivial transformation associated with the spreading dynamics in the paradigm of CST. Without loss of generality, we employ two prototypical models of epidemic spreading: classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics [13] and contact processes (CP) [45, 46] , on both model and real-world (empirical) networks. Inhomogeneous infection and recovery rates as representative characteristics of the natural diversity are incorporated into the diffusion dynamics to better mimic the real-world situation. We assume that only binary time series can be measured, which characterize the status of any node, infected or susceptible, at any time after the outbreak of the epidemic. The source that triggers the spreading process is assumed to be externally inaccessible (hidden). In fact, one may not even realize its existence from available time series. Our method enables, based on relatively small amounts of data, a full reconstruction of the epidemic spreading network with nodal diversity and successful identification of the immediate neighboring nodes of the hidden source (thereby ascertaining its existence and uniquely specifying its connections to nodes in the network). The framework is validated with respect to different amounts of data generated from various combinations of the network structures and dynamical processes. High accuracy, high efficiency and applicability in a strongly stochastic environment with measurement noise and missing information are the most striking characteristics of our framework. Thus broad applications can be expected in addressing significant problems such as targeted control of disease and rumor spreading.",

For small values of nt, e.g., nt = 0.1, the values of elements associated with links and that associated with null connections (actual zeros in the adjacency matrix) overlap, leading to ambiguity in the identification of links. In contrast, for larger values of nt, e.g., nt = 0.4, an explicit gap emerges between the two groups of element values, enabling us to correctly identify all links by simply setting a cut-off within the gap (see Supplementary Fig. 1a and Note 4 for the method to set the cut-off). The success rates (SREL and SRNC) as a function of nt for SIS and CP on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are shown in Figs. 2(b,c) , where we observe nearly perfect reconstruction of links insofar as nt exceeds a relatively small value -an advantage of compressed sensing. The exact reconstruction is robust in the sense that a wide range of nt values can yield nearly 100% success rates.

The conflicts would reduce the accuracy in the reconstruction of the entire network. To characterize the effects of edge conflicts, we study the consistency of mutual assessment of the presence or absence of link between each pair of nodes, as shown in Figs. 2(b,c). We see that inconsistency arises for small values of nt but vanishes completely when the success rates reach 100%, indicating complete consistency among the mutual inferences of nodes and consequently guaranteeing accurate reconstruction of the entire network. Detailed results of success rates and trade-off measures with respect to a variety of model and real networks are displayed in Table I Although the number of base strings is relatively small compared to the network size, we need a set of strings at different time with respect to a base string to formulate the mathematical framework for reconstruction. We study how the length of time series affects the accuracy of reconstruction. Figures 3(a,b) show the success rate as a function of the relative length n t of time series for SIS and CP dynamics on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, where n t is the total length of time series from the beginning of the spreading process divided by the network size N. The results demonstrate that even for very small values of n t , most links can already be identified, as reflected by the high values of the success rate shown. Figures 3(c,d) show the minimum length n min t required to achieve at least 95% success rate for different network sizes. For both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks, n min t decreases considerably as N is increased. This seemingly counterintuitive result is due to the fact that different base strings can share strings at different times to enable reconstruction. In general, as N is increased, nt will increase accordingly. However, a particular string can belong to different base strings with respect to the threshold \u2206, accounting for the slight increase in the absolute length of the time series (see Supplementary  Fig. 4 and Note 5) and the reduction in n min t (see Supplementary Note 3 on the method to choose base and subordinate strings). The dependence of the success rate on the average node degree k for SIS and CP on different networks has been investigated as well (see Supplementary Fig. 5 and Note 5). The results in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 2-5 and Table 1 demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of our reconstruction method based on small amounts of data.",

Fig-ures 4(a,b) show the dependence of the success rate on the fraction n f of states in the time series that flip due to noise for SIS and CP dynamics on two types of networks. We observe that the success rates are hardly affected, providing strong evidence for the applicability of our reconstruction method. For example, even when 25% of the nodal states flip, we can still achieve about 80% success rates for both dynamical processes and different network topologies. Figures 4(c,d) present the success rate versus the fraction n m of unobservable nodes, the states of which are externally inaccessible. We find that the high success rate remains mostly unchanged as n m is increased from zero to 25%, a somewhat counterintuitive but striking result. The high degree of robustness against the limit to access nodal states is elaborated further in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Note 5. We find that, in general, missing information can affect the reconstruction of the neighboring vector, as reflected by the reduction of the gap between the reconstructed values associated with actual links and null connections. However, even for high values of n m , e.g., n m = 0.3, there is still a clear gap, indicating that a full recovery of all links is achievable. We have also found that our method is robust against inaccurately specified diffusion processes with fluctuation in infection rates (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and Note 5). Taken together, the high accuracy, efficiency and robustness against noise, missing information and inaccurately modeling real dynamical processes provide strong credence for the validity and power of our framework for binary time-series based network reconstruction.",

This is an essential step to implement target vaccination strategy in a population or on a computer network to effectively suppress/prevent the spreading of virus at low cost, as a large body of literature indicates that knowledge about the network structure and individual characteristics is sufficient for controlling the spreading dynamics [47] [48] [49] [50] . Here we offer an effective method to infer the individuals' infection rates \u03bb i based solely on the binary time series of the nodal states after an outbreak of contamination. (To our knowledge, there was no prior work addressing this critical issue.) In particular, after all links have been successfully predicted, \u03bb i can be deduced from the infection probabilities that can be approximated by the corresponding infection frequencies (see Methods). These probabilities depend on both \u03bb i and the number of infected neighbors. The reproduced infection rates \u03bb i of individuals for both SIS and CP dynamics on different networks are in quite good agreement with the true values with small prediction errors (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and Note 6). Results from a comprehensive error analysis are listed in Table I , where the uniformly high accuracy validates our method. The inhomogeneous recovery rates \u03b4 i of nodes can be predicted from the binary time series in a more straightforward way, because \u03b4 i 's do not depend on the nodal connections (see Supplementary Fig. 9 and Note 6). Thus our framework is capable of predicting characteristics of nodal diversity in terms of degrees and infection and recovery rates based solely on binary time series of nodal states.",

In practice, the source can be modeled as a special node that is always infected. Starting from the neighborhood of the source, the infection originates from the source and spreads all over the network. We collect a set of time series of the nodal states except the hidden source (see Methods). The basic idea of ascertaining and locating the hidden source is based on missing information from the hidden source when attempting to reconstruct the network. In particular, in order to reconstruct the connections belonging to the immediate neighborhood of the source accurately, time series from the source are needed to generate the matrix \u03a6 and the vector Y. But since the source is hidden, no time series from it are available, leading to reconstruction inaccuracy and, consequently, anomalies in the predicted link patterns of the neighboring nodes. It is then possible to detect the neighborhood of the hidden source by identifying any abnormal connection patterns [51] , which can be accomplished by using different data segments. If the inferred links of a node are stable with respect to different data segments, the node can be deemed to have no connection with the hidden source; otherwise, if the result of inferring a node's links varies significantly with respect to different data segments, the node is likely to be connected to the hidden source. The standard deviation of the predicted results with respect to different data segments can be used as a quantitative criterion for the anomaly. Once the neighboring set of the source is determined, the source is then precisely located topologically. Figure 5 presents an example, where a hidden source is connected with four nodes in the network [ Fig. 5(a) ], as reflected in the network adjacency matrix [ Fig. 5(b) ]. We implement our reconstruction framework on each accessible node by using different sets of data in the time series. For each data set, we predict the neighbors of all nodes and generate an adjacency matrix. Averaging over the elements corresponding to each location in all the reconstructed adjacency matrices, we obtain Fig. 5 (c), in which each row corresponds to the mean number of links in a node's neighborhood. The inferred links of the immediate neighbors of the hidden source exhibit anomalies. To quantify the anomalies, we calculate the structural standard deviation \u03c3 from different data segments, where \u03c3 associated with node i is defined through the ith row in the adjacency matrix as",

Both theoretically and practically, our framework can be used to address the extremely challenging problem of reconstructing the intrinsic interacting patterns of complex stochastic systems based on small amounts of polarized time series. The key to success of our method lies in our development of a novel class of transformation allowing the network inference problem to be converted to the problem of sparse signal reconstruction, which can then be solved by the standard compressed-sensing algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of our framework in uncovering the network structure, the natural diversity in the nodal characteristics, and any hidden source are guaranteed by the compressed sensing theory with rigorous proof for lowdata requirement and convergence to optimal solution. The feasibility of our framework has been demonstrated using a large number of combinations of epidemic processes and network structures, where in all cases extremely accurate reconstruction is achieved. Our approach opens up a new avenue towards fully addressing the inverse problem in complex stochastic systems in a highly efficient manner, a fundamental stepping stone toward understanding and controlling complex dynamical systems in general.",

A main purpose of our work is to identify the key individuals in the network to implement target control and to locate the source of infection to isolate it so as to prevent recurrent infection in the future. While for any spreading dynamics, the most effective way to prevent a large-scale outbreak is to implement control during the early stage, this may be impractical in many situations. If we miss the early stage, which is possible especially in complex networks where the epidemic threshold can be near zero, to be able to reconstruct the spreading network is of tremendous value. Besides disease spreading, our framework is applicable to rumor or information spreading.

Taken together, our results provide strong credence to the proposition that complex networks can be fully decrypted from measurements, even when stochastic disturbance and hidden sources are present. This can offer a deeper understanding of complex systems in general and significantly enhance our ability to control them based on, e.g., the recently developed controllability theory of complex networks [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] .",

Each node of the network represents an individual and links are connections along which the infection can propagate to others with certain probability. At each time step, a susceptible node i in state 0 is infected with rate \u03bb i if it is connected to an infected node in state 1. If i connects to more than one infected neighbor, the infection probability P 01 is given by equation (4) . At the same time, infected nodes are continuously recovered to be susceptible at the rates \u03b4 i . The CP model has been used extensively to describe, e.g., the spreading of infection and competition of animals over a territory, where \u03bb i is determined by equation (7) . The main difference between SIS and CP dynamics lies in the influence on a node's state from its vicinity. In both SIS and CP dynamics, \u03bb i and \u03b4 i depend on the individuals' immune systems and are selected from a Gaussian distribution characterizing the natural diversity (see Supplementary Note 7 for details of numerical simulations). Moreover, a hidden source is regarded as infected for all time.",

(a) 14 snapshots of data at the time instants t 1 -t 14 of 8 nodes in a sample network, where S i is the time series of node 2 and S \u2212i denotes the strings of other nodes at different times. The neighborhood of node 2 is to be reconstructed. Only the pairs 00 and 01 in the time series of S i (i = 2) and the corresponding S \u2212i contain useful information about the network, as marked by different colors. (b) Since S i (t + 1) is determined by the neighbors of i and S \u2212i (t), we sort out S i (t + 1) and S \u2212i (t) in the colored sections of the time series in (a). According to the threshold parameters \u2206 = 3/7 and \u0398 = 3/7, we calculate the normalized Hamming distance between each pair of strings S \u2212i (t), finding two base strings att 1 = t 1 andt 2 = t 11 with H[S \u2212i (t 1 ), S \u2212i (t 2 )] > \u0398. We separate the colored strings into two groups that are led by the two base strings, respectively. In each group, the normalized Hamming distance H[S \u2212i (t \u03b1 ), S \u2212i (t \u03bd )] between the base string and other strings is calculated and the difference from S \u2212i (t \u03b1 ) in each string is marked by red. Using parameter \u2206, in the group led by S \u2212i (t 1 ), S \u2212i (t 5 ) and S i (t 6 ) are preserved, because of H[S \u2212i (t 1 ), S \u2212i (t 5 )] < \u2206.",
