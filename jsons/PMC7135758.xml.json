Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is a critical infrastructure that needs to be part of preparedness and response planning for a severe pandemic. Legal and regulatory frameworks should recognize prehospital capabilities as lawmakers attempt to facilitate capacity-building collaboration, which is critical to disaster response. The prehospital system's lack of surge capacity has been detailed [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], and agencies seek direction regarding preparedness planning from state agencies [6], [7]. The goal of this study was to describe state-level EMS and Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) (where 9-1-1 calls are answered) pandemic influenza preparedness. These results are especially timely as U.S. policy makers begin to discuss necessary changes to the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act [8], [9].",

States were asked to provide supporting documentation to substantiate each response. Reviewers examined the submitted documentation and assigned a score for each question based on the criteria shown in Table 1\n. Scoring consisted of an ordinal scale describing the level (or completeness) of response for each state's submitted documents and their appropriateness in supporting the activity addressed. Although these results detail preparedness efforts prior to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, information collected post-2009 H1N1 indicates that these results are still valid [12]. However, these data fail to characterize 9-1-1 preparedness. Furthermore, the role of EMS in the 2009 H1N1 response was limited to assisting with vaccination efforts [13], [14].",

However, more states had developed plans and procedures defining the role of EMS during an influenza pandemic than for 9-1-1. In addition, there were key elements of all-hazards disaster preparedness without substantial planning. For example, protocols allowing EMS personnel to treat and release patients with conditions not requiring transfer to a healthcare facility were notably absent thus potentially limiting the healthcare system's ability to help prevent surge at medical facilities during a severe pandemic. These findings are consistent with reports demonstrating the need for better integration between EMS and the rest of the healthcare community [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].",

Findings that the majority of states had not begun planning to address the isolation and quarantine of EMS professionals (most frequent score of 1) could seriously impact EMS systems. Ensuring EMS workforce health and minimizing health risk is essential to supporting their role in mitigating and responding to an infectious disease outbreak. During the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, Toronto encountered significant operational problems in providing EMS services when approximately half of the city's prehospital personnel required quarantine [25].

Furthermore, communication problems can adversely affect patient outcomes, even resulting in death [28]. Effective hazard mitigation often requires a rapid response capability with little room for coordination difficulties [29]. This underscores the need for response agency participation from the early stages of planning, and a clear understanding of the roles and expectations during an incident. This study's finding that only 13.3% of states had complete plans delineating the role of 9-1-1 during a pandemic further demonstrates the absence of 9-1-1 from emergency planning.",

During a pandemic the use of alternate approaches to divert non-emergent patients could be utilized. Utilizing a triage and classification system can reduce the number of EMS responses, transports, and ED visits, and without adversely affecting patient outcomes [34]. The implementation of a medically safe and appropriate emergency number triage system will be critical to a state's ability to reduce the anticipated surge of requests for both prehospital and hospital care during a severe pandemic. Once triaged, a 9-1-1 caller may be directed to varying options for assistance given locally available resources, including instructions for home care; referral to a primary care provider, to community services (e.g., poison control), or to urgent care clinics. Furthermore, a PSAP triage and classification system can effectively guide EMS equipment and transportation resource usage, thereby lessening the drain on EMS resources during a patient surge [35]. The absence of telephone triage protocols to guide 9-1-1 callers to alternate call centers represents a potentially missed opportunity to consistently and systematically decrease the demand for EMS and ED services during a severe pandemic.",
