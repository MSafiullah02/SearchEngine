How long can we delay treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer or other highrisk cases before the risk of metastasis outweighs the risk of hospitalization during this time? How long can we delay routine oncologic surveillance imaging and endoscopy? These are some of the many questions we, as a specialty, need to address.
