However, not all enterprise software needs are addressed by classic, community-led, volunteer-driven OSS communities. In particular, community-led projects struggle to address the challenge of providing software for institutions rather than individuals, such as financial or HR systems [23]. In part this is because many community-led projects are founded by IT professionals to meet their own needs, what Raymond famously described as developers scratching their own itches [29]. Mackie [23] identified several other possible reasons why community-led OSS has not met commercial needs: the number of developers with relevant skills might be too few to build a community, the benefits of the software may be too diffuse to encourage collaboration, and the software may be too complex to be developed on a voluntary basis.",

Such an approach could offer an alternative to the build-or-buy decisions companies currently face. In contrast to off-the-shelf proprietary solutions, OSS can help companies avoid the costs of extensive customization and vendor lock-in, which lead to a high total cost of ownership [3, 21]. At the same time, it is cheaper than custom software, and has the potential to become the de-facto standard, reducing training costs [22, 39]. In the last fifteen years, there has been a significant increase in vendor-led foundations. Unlike community-led OSS, vendor-led OSS does not develop organically but is synthetically created by a consortium of companies [28]. Vendor-led OSS should not be confused with single-vendor OSS, where development is led by a single company with a business model based on complementary software or services [31].",

We addressed this goal through a qualitative survey of software vendors, consultants, and DSOs associated with oK. The contribution of this paper is a description of the software ecosystem of oK, which includes the economic objectives of participants, and the conflicts arising from different economic objectives.

This study was provided as part of a larger report to oK, thus making it available to a professional audience that was familiar with oK but not a direct data source. We triangulated on each category of participant by asking interview partners about not only their own experiences, but also about other members of the ecosystem. Dependeability is about ensuring the consistency of results.

However, this source of conflict is not commonplace in vendor-led foundations [37], suggesting that user-led foundations are somewhat different.
