            "text": "A fundamental understanding of how bacteria and viruses become airborne remains elusive yet is central to understanding their role in atmospheric processes and the spread of disease. Microbial transmission and survival are influenced by particle size, relative humidity, temperature, environmental composition, and virus type1\u20133, yet the mechanisms controlling their initial airborne transmission are poorly understood. The atmosphere contains vast bacterial (6 \u00d7 104\u20131.6 \u00d7 107 cells m\u22123) and viral populations arising from a wide range of aquatic, terrestrial, and organismal biomes4\u20137. As the ocean covers 71% of the planet and contains 60\u201390% of the world\u2019s prokaryotes by cell abundance in open ocean and sediment8, sea spray aerosol (SSA) represents a significant yet largely under-studied source of airborne bacteria and viruses. Bacteria in aerosols can travel as far as 11,000 km, with air residence times of days to weeks1,5,9, and algal viruses maintain infectivity over several hundred kilometers10. Airborne bacteria and viruses influence climate by serving as cloud seeds and inducing ice nucleation11\u201314. Microbes detected in clouds and precipitation have major impacts on ice formation and precipitation efficiency, yet their source remains largely unknown15. Airborne microbes also impact air quality through transmission of allergens and pathogens16. However, identification of species-level contributions of ocean microbes to atmospheric processes and air quality has never been definitely determined.",

Accordingly, an ocean\u2013atmosphere facility, developed collaboratively by chemists, oceanographers, and marine biologists was employed to study microbial aerosolization in a controlled setting using locally derived seawater and breaking waves32. This 13,000 L enclosed wave channel system is supplied with filtered air and is conducive to microbial growth at ocean-relevant abundances.

For this purpose, we characterize bacterial and viral communities sampled from bulk (subsurface), SSML, and SSA at several time points during a 34-day nutrient-induced bloom event using read- and assembly based metagenomic approaches. We report SSA enhancement patterns correspond to related taxa and therefore, are determined at the genomic level, and that bacteria are generally more enriched in SSA than viruses. Changes to SSA enrichment as apparent responses to environmental cues or other signals are shared between related taxonomic classes and orders. This identifies taxa relevant to atmospheric processes and airborne systems. These relationships allow comparisons within taxa to determine aerosolization mechanisms with potential application to the understanding of environmental microbes and pathogen transmission.",

Filtered (50 \u00b5m) coastal Pacific seawater (32\u00b0 52\u2032 01.4\u2033 N 117\u00b0 15\u2032 26.5\u2033 W) was supplemented with nitrate, phosphate, and trace metals to induce phytoplankton growth under continuous illumination (45 \u00b5E m\u22122 s\u22121) with mixing provided by wave breaking or bubbling (Methods). Exogenous organic matter  was not added. The conditions generated two phytoplankton blooms and corresponding heterotrophic bacterial blooms (Fig. 1a). Growth was monitored using chlorophyll a fluorescence to track bulk phytoplankton abundance and cell and virus counts in bulk seawater, SSML, and SSA (Fig. 1a, Table 1). Bulk chlorophyll a levels, cell counts by flow cytometry, and viral counts by epifluorescence microscopy were representative of natural oceanic bloom timescales and concentrations8,33,34 (Supplementary Note 1). Due to the proximity of the SSA collection ports to the breaking waves, the average aerosol bacterial concentrations (1.26 \u00d7 107 \u00b1 0.19 \u00d7 107 cells m\u22123) were 1000-fold higher than those estimated in natural environments where aerosols are sampled many meters above the sea surface and diluted by the atmosphere9. Aquatic bacterial abundance moderately increased with phytoplankton populations during the first phytoplankton bloom, while the peak for the second bacterial bloom was both larger in intensity and slightly delayed from the phytoplankton peak. The concentrations of bacterial cells in the bulk and SSML were positively correlated, while aerosol abundances were negatively correlated with seawater population. Bacteria were not immediately released into SSA from SSML, suggesting dynamics that depend on growth and accumulation in the bulk seawater and SSML prior to atmospheric release. In the ocean, virus-like particle concentrations are generally 5\u201325 times greater than bacteria35, and here we observed ten-fold greater bulk viral concentration by cell (Fig. 1a) and particle counts (Table 1). However, average SSA concentrations of viruses (1.19 \u00d7 107 \u00b1 0.58 \u00d7 107 cells m\u22123) and bacteria were nearly equivalent indicating preferential aerosolization of bacteria relative to viruses (Table 2).",

Comparisons between the taxa in these compartments reveal key differences in community distributions (Fig. 1b, c). Likely due to adaptation to the growth system and preference for species thriving in eutrophic conditions, the aquatic microbial population shifted significantly from the original oceanic composition, but after Day 8 remained relatively constant for the duration of the experiment with small shifts in individual taxa similar to bacterial community shifts observed during natural marine phytoplankton blooms39,42 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The blooms also contained taxa not often found in seawater including an avian strain of Escherichia coli and a novel strain of Legionella, as revealed by assembly of nearly complete genomes (Supplementary Table 4, 5). The novel Legionella strain has 70\u201380% amino acid identity to orthologs in Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires\u2019 disease) and Legionella drancourtii and has both Type II and Type IV secretion systems typical of pathogenic strains. E. coli and Legionella were present in initial samples (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting they were native to the coastal community but became enriched in our system during the experiment. The recovery of these genomes is consistent with increasing evidence for enteric contaminants in coastal marine waters43,44.",

A Gaussian distribution of species, centered at (1,1), would be expected if aerosolization was random. However, the \u201cspindle\u201d-shaped distribution of the data reveals non-random patterns. The distribution is similar in the genome spatial coverage trimmed data set (Supplementary Fig 3a, b). Histograms and normality analysis revealed positively skewed data with a non-normal distribution and mean bacterial AF of 0.90 (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c, Supplementary Table 7). Genomes predominantly exhibit SSA enrichment or depression with respect to both bulk and SSML. While water-enriched species (AF values <1) represented 52% of the population, aerosol enrichment was much larger in amplitude than diminishment, reflected in a greater extension of data points into the red region compared to the blue region of Fig. 2a.

In contrast, SSML enrichment is approximately the same for both (0.98 and 1.02 for bacteria and viruses, respectively). In read-based sequence analysis, the proportion of viral to bacterial reads in aerosol at the division level was consistently lower than bulk in all size fractions suggesting decreased viral transfer even when they are associated with larger particles such as bacteria or phytoplankton (Supplementary Table 8). Decreased viral transfer is further supported by comparisons of data distributions of viral and bacterial communities in read-based analyses (Supplementary Fig. 4a-f, Supplementary Table 7). Viral distributions were shifted more negatively and had lower mean AFs than bacterial populations (viral\u20140.72 \u00b1 4.70, bacterial\u20140.90 \u00b1 2.32). Studies in pathogen transmission suggest that smaller bioaerosol size leads to increased residence time in the air1,2. However, these results indicate that size is not the only contributor to marine viral aerosolization.",

Similar to bacteria, while most viral genomes followed the aerosolization patterns of their taxa, select genomes differed from their closest relatives in their aerosolization behavior revealing genomic differences that may be useful in determination of relevant biochemical pathways.

This coordination is seen in intermittent Alphaproteobacteria and high AF lipid-enveloped viruses that were generally more waterborne on Day 8 (pre-bloom) while several Gammaproteobacteria genomes were aerosol enriched. During the second bloom (Day 28), when total seawater bacterial counts were high, Flavobacteriia and nearly all viral genomes became enriched in SSA.

The constitutive, low AF Flavobacteriia were the least surface enriched with an average S:B of 0.95 compared to 1.92 for all species examined (Supplementary Fig. 5). Constitutively high AF Actinobacteria had a corresponding above average S:B of 3.92.

The results reveal the taxon-specific dynamics of viral and bacterial transfer across the air\u2013sea interface during phytoplankton blooms, conditions that generate increased bacterial and viral water concentrations with increased potential impact to airborne environments. Aerosol enrichment is dictated by inherent biochemical properties and influenced by environmental conditions. Taxon-specific patterns are applied to reveal different aerosolization mechanisms and indicate trends of broad taxonomies applicable to a variety of systems. Taxa with enhanced aerosolization likely have a larger influence on climate properties, and studies with relevant isolates will clarify specific contributions to atmospheric processes. Several bacterial lineages of known respiratory and airborne pathogens are identified in this study, including Legionella, E. coli, Corynebacterium, and Mycobacterium. Factors that modulate SSA formation likely will apply to other aerosolization processes. Elucidating the specific aerosolization mechanisms of pathogens, either from environmental reservoirs or from hosts themselves, may form the basis of therapeutics that target aerosolization by interaction with surface features or inhibition of relevant biosynthetic pathways. These findings provide a framework to resolve such mechanisms.",

            "text": "The wave channel was set up as described in Wang et al.57. 13,000 L of ocean water was collected off Scripps Pier in La Jolla, CA (32\u00b0 52\u2032 01.4\u2033 N 117\u00b0 15\u2032 26.5\u2033 W). Water was filtered using 50 \u03bcM Nitex mesh to remove grazing zooplankton before transfer into the wave channel tank. The wavechannel is a 33 m \u00d7 0.5 m \u00d7 1 m (0.6 m water depth), enclosed (supplied HEPA-filtered air), glass, growth system equipped with a hydraulic pump attached to a vertical paddle at one end. Each pulse created one simulated wave that broke midway through the channel just upstream of sampling ports and is calibrated to mimic aerosol formation that occurs during natural wave breaking32. Aerosol sampling ports were positioned ~3 ft downfield of the general position of the breaking waves. Bloom conditions were initiated by the addition of F/2 medium (Proline, Aquatic Eco-Systems, Apopka, FL) supplemented separately with sodium metasilicate. F/2 is a common marine medium for algae cultivation that provides 880 \u00b5M NaNO3, 36 \u00b5M NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, 70 \u00b5M Na2SiO3\u00b79H2O along with trace metals58. An additional 9 \u00b5M sodium phosphate was added to the wave flume on July 25, 2014 as phosphate was depleted in the system. No exogenous carbon or additional nutritional supplementation was given for bacterial cultivation. The tank was continuously illuminated (45 \u00b5E m\u22122 s\u22121). During periods when aerosols were not being collected, additional aeration was provided by bubbling with HEPA-filtered air through perforated tygon tubing at the bottom of the tank.",

Kraken was run in paired mode with the full NCBI RefSeq database (release 70, April 30, 2015) using default cutoffs. Genus-level annotations in Kraken are nearly 100% reliable in benchmark studies when the genus is in the database, while species assignments are 89% accurate with human microbiome data sets36. This accuracy is much lower in environmental samples because the representation of relevant genomes in the database is much less complete. To prevent errors in calculations, the taxonomic data set generated with Kraken was filtered to exclude any species that had any sample containing <0.001% of the total population or if 10 or more samples (of 18 total) contained <0.01%. Spatial coverage analysis was performed to determine the percent of the genome that is represented in a reference genome. Spatial coverage for each genome was calculated by implementing the following pipeline: (1) parsing Kraken label output files to generate individual fastq files for each taxonomy hit; (2) mapping the reads to their respective genome assembly (e.g., full chromosomes, contigs, plasmids, etc.) [HISAT2 v2.0.0]65; (3) converting the *.sam files to *.bedgraph files [bedtools v2.24.0]66; and (4) concatenating all sequences in the genome assembly and calculating the proportion of positions that were mapped. Eighty-five percent nucleotide identity is the mapping criteria. The availability of reference genomes allowed analysis of 214 of 243 genomes included in the trimmed set of 197 bacterial and 46 viral genomes. This represented 28% of the total genomes in the original abundance trimmed set (756 genomes). The coverage trimmed data set omitted species below 0.1% spatial coverage to avoid erroneous annotations due common elements such as transposons (Supplementary Table 3).",

Genome quality throughout was assessed using QUAST(v3.0) with default settings68. Original reads for each sample were mapped to the contigs (CLC) to build sample specific coverage information. All contigs greater than 5 kbp were clustered into genome bins using VizBin69 and completeness of each of these bins was assessed using CheckM (v1.0.5)70 (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, 14 bins were recovered from a pangenome in the data by utilizing hierarchical clustering and sample specific coverage information. Genome annotations were determined utilizing APIS (https://github.com/jhbadger/APIS)71 and manual curation using PhyloDB (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/labs/aallen/data)71 as the reference database. APIS automates the process of sequence similarity, alignment, and phylogenetic inference for each protein in a given data set72. APIS results were manually curated to determine predicted bin level taxonomy. All recovered genomes were reported regardless of completeness.

Aerosolization factors (AF), A:B and A:S, on different days are indicated (Blue = Diminished aerosolization; Yellow = Neutral aerosolization; Red = Enhanced aerosolization). Blanks indicate samples below threshold limits. a Bacteria class is indicated on outer ring to further indicate species and shading of species names indicate orders of interest. In b, the outer ring denotes viral family and shading indicates presence or lack of a viral envelope. i, ii, and iii indicate genomes with aerosolization patterns that differ from their closest relatives.
