Of the approximately 14 000 nonredundant macromolecular structures (<95% sequence identity) deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) at the time of this writing, more than 70% have been determined by x-ray crystallography, eclipsing all other biophysical methods combined (e.g., NMR spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, neutron diffraction, and electron diffraction) (see\n3.17 The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank). Owing to a great number of technological advances in the field of x-ray crystallography in recent years (many of which will be reviewed in this chapter), the method is certain to maintain its dominant position in structure-based drug design (SBDD) (see\n4.24 Structure-Based Drug Design \u2013 The Use of Protein Structure in Drug Discovery). Recent estimates have underscored the value of an x-ray crystal structure in the drug discovery process: the average cost of $15\u201320 million required for a successful round of lead identification to investigational new drug filing can be reduced by an estimated 50% if 3D structure is centrally utilized in the discovery process.4 The largest cost reductions stem from the increased quality of lead candidates and number of different pharmacophore series that can be designed with the aid of structural information. Considering the great value of a 3D structure, the relative cost of an x-ray structure determination is nearly negligible, with the elucidation of novel soluble targets averaging between $140 000 (bacterial) and $450 000 (human). On the other hand, the successful x-ray crystal structure determination of integral membrane proteins, which represent the largest class of human drug targets and are particularly recalcitrant to crystallization, can cost millions of dollars (see\n2.19 Diversity versus Focus in Choosing Targets and Therapeutic Areas).4 Ongoing developments in the field of soluble and membrane protein crystallization are poised to reduce further the attrition rates and average cost of x-ray structure determination in the coming years.",

            "text": "The utility of structural models in the rational design of therapeutically useful molecules had its humble beginnings in the mid-1970s, when two researchers at The Squibb Institute of Medical Research, David Cushman and Miguel Ondetti, attempted to design small molecule inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme involved in the regulation of blood pressure. ACE, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, cleaves the C-terminal His-Leu dipeptide from the prohormone angiotensin I (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) to produce angiotensin II, a potent vasopressor octapeptide. Back then, only a handful of macromolecular x-ray crystal structures had been elucidated, one being carboxypeptidase A, a Zn2+-containing exopeptidase, which had been a research focus of William Lipscomb's group at Harvard.5, 6, 7 Although the structure of ACE was not known at the time, biochemical evidence suggested the two enzymes might be similar: both could be inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as EDTA, both could be reactivated by Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+, and both were inactive against substrate analogs containing terminal carboxamide or dicarboxylic amino acids. The working hypothesis that Cushman and Ondetti had formulated was that ACE was a Zn2+-metallopeptidase bearing an active site similar to carboxypeptidase A, with ACE cleaving dipeptides rather than single amino acids from the C-terminus of peptide substrates.",

            "text": "Guided by Lipscomb's structures5, 6, 7 and published biochemical data reporting inhibition of carboxypeptidase A by d-benzylsuccinic acid,8 Cushman and Ondetti sketched out a model of substrate and inhibitor binding to the ACE active site (Figure 1\n). In creating their model, they postulated that the potent inhibitory properties of d-benzylsuccinic acid against carboxypeptidase A (K\ni=4.5\u00d710\u22127\n M) originated from a specific binding mode that optimized interactions between the inhibitor and the important substrate-binding groups at the enzyme's active site. Several rationalizations were included in the design process:1.ACE, like carboxypeptidase A, probably carries a positively charged group, which interacts with the carboxy-terminal carboxylate moiety of the ligand.2.The active-site Zn2+ of ACE and carboxypeptidase A is suitably located to polarize the carbonyl group of the substrate's scissile peptide bond. The metal is likely coordinated by the anionic succinate moiety of d-benzylsuccinic acid in the case of carboxypeptidase A.3.By virtue of ACE's dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity, the distance between its positively charged carboxyl-binding site and its active-site Zn2+ should be greater than the corresponding distance in carboxypeptidase A by the length of approximately one amino acid. An additional \u2018spacer\u2019 would therefore need to be incorporated into an ACE inhibitor.4.All naturally occurring peptidic ACE inhibitors, such as teprotide (isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper), carry a proline at the C-terminus, suggesting that this feature is critical and should be preserved in nonpeptidic inhibitors as well.\n",

            "text": "Armed with their simple pencil-sketch, Cushman and Ondetti set out to create potent nonpeptidic ACE inhibitors. Their first compound, succinyl-l-proline, indeed proved to be a specific inhibitor of ACE; however, it was only slightly active. By exploring different structural modifications, a simple methylation of the succinyl moiety was found to increase inhibitory potency by more than one order of magnitude. Further attempts to improve the binding affinity of this compound, 2-d-methylsuccinyl-l-proline, steered their decision to explore the role of the inhibitor's probable Zn2+-binding moiety. Replacement of the succinyl carboxyl group with a sulfhydryl function (Figure 1) reduced the 50% inhibition constant (IC50) by an additional three orders of magnitude.9 The resulting compound, 2-d-methyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl-l-proline (\u2018captopril\u2019, marketed under the tradename Capoten), turned out to be a potent oral ACE-specific antihypertensive, received FDA approval in the early 1980s, and became Squibb's first billion-dollar drug. Nearly three decades later, the recent crystal structure determinations of ACE:inhibitor complexes10, 11 finally confirm that \u2013 despite ACE bearing little overall structural similarity to carboxypeptidase A \u2013 the original pencil-and-paper models of ACE-inhibitor binding were remarkably accurate (Figure 1). Cushman and Ondetti's seminal work represents a landmark in the field of SBDD.",

Available 3D structures of homologs, orthologs, or paralogs are a rich source of information regarding domain boundaries and unstructured loop regions, which need to be considered when designing crystallizable targets (see\n3.17 The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank). Because multidomain proteins can exhibit a high degree of conformational flexibility, which might preclude crystallization, trimming down the target to a more compact form consisting of the catalytic core represents a logical strategy, particularly for the purposes of SBDD. Some recent examples pertaining to this approach include studies on the kinase domain of c-Abl,15 and our own work on the bifunctional catalytic domain of the bacterial stringent response factor, RelA/SpoT.16 Proteolytic mapping of the full-length protein with subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE can be a useful technique for identifying stable domains. Typically, the full-length protein is digested with a panel of proteases, and samples are analyzed either at fixed time points with different protease concentrations, or at variable time points with fixed protease concentrations. The protein can also be digested in the presence of known ligands or inhibitors, since ligand-induced ordering of unstructured regions may lead to unique digestion maps and suggest alternative possibilities for DNA construct design. Characterization of stable fragments by N-terminal sequencing or mass spectrometry is subsequently carried out to provide a framework for gene construct optimization.17\n",

            "text": "To aid in purification, recombinant protein targets are usually fused to an affinity tag, which can be added to the N- or C-terminus of the target sequence, or, if necessary, inserted within the sequence. To maximize the crystallization potential of the recombinant target, emphasis should be placed on diversification when selecting affinity tags. A vast number of affinity tags are available, and an ideal choice will depend on numerous factors including preferred tag location, tag size (ranging from a few residues to >100 kDa), and the desired balance of auxiliary tag characteristics such as gene expression and solubility of the tagged protein, ease of purification, overall purity of the eluted sample, or secreted expression.12 Oligohistidine tags (His-tags) are often a first choice because of their relatively low cost, small size, and ease of use.32 The incorporation of a His-tag permits simple one-step purification using an immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin such as Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate, but a second \u2018polishing step\u2019 using size-exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography is often needed to eliminate contaminating host proteins that have a natural affinity for IMAC resins. If subsequent tag removal is desired (e.g., if it is suspected that the tag might be interfering with crystallization or protein activity), vectors such as Qiagen's pQE-30 Xa are available that allow incorporation of a cleavable tag containing a flanking protease recognition site. A recent comparative study of different affinity tags has touted the use of the StrepII tag (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys), which binds a modified streptavidin-coupled matrix (Strep-Tactin).33 According to this study, the StrepII tag affords much higher purity over the His tag at a comparable cost. Large affinity tags containing fusion proteins, such as the maltose-binding protein,34 thioredoxin,35 or glutathione-S-transferase36 can improve folding and enhance solubility of the coupled target. Moreover, the growing number of chimeric target-fusion crystal structures that are being reported suggests that fusion proteins can be useful tools for crystallization.37\n",

The utilization of Escherichia coli as an expression host has long been the method of choice because it provides a fairly robust and easy means for producing recombinant proteins at a minimal expense. Despite these advantages, it should be pointed out that a large percentage (in some cases more than 50%) of cytosolic proteins encoded by bacterial and archaeal genomes appear to be insoluble when expressed in E. coli.38 Production of eukaryotic proteins can be particularly problematic if posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation are required for proper folding and activation of the recombinant target.39 Eukaryotic expression systems offer the advantage of having the capability to phosphorylate and glycosylate recombinant proteins, but to various degrees.40 Of these, the baculovirus system is particularly suitable to the high-throughput needs of an SBDD program, as insect cells are typically more durable than mammalian cells.13 Recently, the yeast Pichia pastoris has been genetically engineered into a \u2018humanized\u2019 form with a full complement of N-glycosylation machinery,41 a development which paves the way for large-scale production of recombinant human proteins with immediate applications ranging from protein therapeutics to SBDD.",

There are multiple cases illustrating the benefit of binding-partner coexpression if one protein component is insoluble or unstable when expressed on its own. For example, a complex of the polyomavirus internal protein VP2/VP3 with the pentameric major capsid protein VP1 was successfully prepared and crystallized only after coexpression of the components in E. coli. Coexpression was essential to obtain the complex since VP2 and VP3 fragments were found to be insoluble when expressed independently.45\n",

            "text": "Once a successful purification protocol has been established, it is frequently the case that the final elution buffer is inappropriate for initiating crystallization trials. Moreover, it is not unusual to observe that the solubility of the recombinant target in standard elution buffers is much lower than the protein concentration normally required for crystallization (usually 5\u201320 mg mL\u22121). Even though Franz Hofmeister observed the differential solubility of proteins in various salts more than 125 years ago46, 47 and a large amount of subsequent research has been conducted on this phenomenon,48 protein solubility optimization can still be regarded somewhat as a \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 science because proteins are complex biological polyelectrolytes with fairly unpredictable solubility characteristics. The ordering of anions and cations according to their general ability to stabilize the structure of proteins has been referred to as the Hofmeister Series. Ammonium sulfate, which is a commonly used precipitant in protein crystallography, tends to both stabilize proteins in the folded state and drive them out of solution, while guanidinium chloride has the opposite tendencies. The differential effect of salts is one of the most important variables to screen when searching for conditions that enhance solubility of an overexpressed protein. Cosolvent additives, which can modulate protein solubility through direct interactions with the protein or by modifying the surrounding water structure,49 are also worthwhile to explore for particularly recalcitrant proteins. Glycerol can enhance solubility without denaturing proteins.48, 50 Detergents can improve solubility by binding to hydrophobic surface patches on proteins.51 Additional cosolvents such as small organic molecules, polyvalent ions, sugars, and polyhydric alcohols can also help to improve protein solubility and stability through different effects.52, 53, 54, 55, 56 Screening for an ideal solubility buffer composition is therefore a complex multiparameter puzzle. Lindwall and co-workers57 were one of the first groups to approach this problem by developing a sparse-matrix solubility screen that could be used on crude cell extracts carrying the recombinant protein. The screen is empirically designed based on known solubility enhancers, and has produced favorable results in our laboratory for proteins that appeared otherwise insoluble in standard lysis and purification buffers. Alternative solubility screening methods employing dynamic light scattering or photometric analysis have been developed specifically for crystallography applications.58, 59\n",

            "text": "Glycosylation can be a particularly problematic source of heterogeneity when eukaryotic expression systems are used. The negative influence of attached oligosaccharides on the crystallizability of glycoproteins presumably stems from elevated surface entropy due to conformational flexibility of the oligosaccharide chains, as well as differences in glycan chain length, branching, and sugar composition. Removal of the attached oligosaccharides by enzymatic deglycosylation has been suggested as a way to overcome this problem,71, 72 and indeed several reports have emphasized the importance of complete deglycosylation for obtaining suitably diffracting crystals.73, 74, 75 For complete removal of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides, peptide-N-glycosidases such as PNGase F or PNGase A are often used, which also cause deamidation of the asparagine residue to aspartic acid.76 In our experience, however, leaving the innermost sugar residue attached to the protein may offer additional possibilities for sugar-mediated crystal-contact formation,62 and different deglycosylation strategies (selective versus complete deglycosylation) should therefore be devised (Figure 4\n). As an example for selective N-deglycosylation, partial digestion might be attempted with selective endoglycosidases (such as endo F1\u2013F3 or endo H), which leave the innermost N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) of the N-linked diacetylchitobiose glycan core attached to the modified Asn. In cases where the GlcNAc is fucosylated, a combined treatment with \u03b1-fucosidase might be warranted. Unfortunately, there is no enzyme comparable to PNGase F or PNGase A for removing O-linked glycans from Ser/Thr residues. Monosaccharides must be sequentially trimmed off by a series of exoglycosidases until the Gal-(1,3)-GalNAc core remains, at which point O-glycosidase can be used to remove the core structure without chemically modifying the Ser/Thr residue.77 Modifications to the core structure can often block the action of O-glycosidase and may require the use of additional glycosidases such as \u03b1-2-(3,6,8,9)-neuraminidase.78 It should be noted that a nonspecific galactosidase or \u03b2-(1,3)-galactosidase can be used to hydrolyze the galactose from the core glycan, leaving the O-linked GalNAc attached to the Ser/Thr and thereby providing an alternative to complete sugar removal.",

After expression, the mutant tACE (tACE\u039436NJ) was treated with endoglycosidase H to selectively remove all but the innermost GlcNAc residue at each N-glycosylation site. Although the expression was low, tACE\u039436NJ was shown to be homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, fully active in enzymatic assays, and produced crystals diffracting to 2.0 \u00c5resolution.

Using the initial crystal structure as a guide, all disordered or highly flexible polypeptide regions (as judged by missing electron density or high atomic temperature factors) were deleted from the gene construct. Moreover, a free Cys residue, which was exposed by the truncation, was mutated to Ala, and an additional Asn\u2192Gln point mutation was introduced to remove an N-glycosylation site. The resulting modified urokinase, termed micro-urokinase, was subsequently crystallized in a better-diffracting crystal form, which was suitable for high-throughput soaking experiments and rational drug design.",

Because efforts to obtain crystals of CDK-4 for design of CDK-4-selective inhibitors were unsuccessful, Merck scientists mutated the ATP-binding pocket of the crystallizable CDK-2 homolog to create a CDK-4 active-site mimic. This approach resulted in the successful design of a CDK-4-specific inhibitor.99 During the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, our group was able to integrate the structural data which we obtained on the main proteinases of human coronavirus 229E and transmissible gastroenteritis (corona)virus, with molecular modeling and biochemical analyses, to propose that derivatives of AG7088 (an inhibitor of the distantly related human rhinovirus 3C proteinase) would be promising lead candidates for the design of anti-SARS drugs targeting the SARS coronavirus main proteinase.100\n",

The DNA shuffling method relies on homologous recombination during the PCR reassembly of gene fragments from multiple parents to generate crossovers at points of high sequence identity. The procedure can generate a vast library of chimeras, which can be rapidly screened in parallel for expression, solubility, and activity. Sequence variants that meet or exceed solubility and activity criteria can then undergo crystallization trials. This strategy has recently paid off for Keenan and colleagues who implemented a directed evolution program for engineering a glyphosate N-acetyltransferase (GAT) superenzyme to confer glyphosate resistance in transgenic plants.101 Initial attempts to crystallize three wild-type GAT enzymes, both in the presence and absence of ligands, failed to produce crystals suitable for structure determination. To overcome this bottleneck, multiple rounds of DNA shuffling were carried out between three wild-type GAT genes in conjunction with high-throughput screening to identify GAT chimeras with decent expression, strong enzymatic activity, and high solubility. Eight randomly chosen GAT variants that met the above criteria were selected from the library, with each containing 5\u201325% exchanged amino acid content relative to the wild-type enzymes. Utilizing the same crystallization procedure as for the wild-type enzymes (96-condition sparse matrix screen conducted both in the presence and absence of ligands), two of the eight GAT chimeras produced suitable crystals, and the crystal structure of one of them was solved. Not surprisingly, the resulting 1.6 \u00c5crystal structure showed that some of the exchanged regions in the shuffled GAT variant were involved in crystal contact formation.101\n",

Perhaps the earliest example demonstrating the effectiveness of this method was the rational genetic engineering of crystal contacts in human H ferritin.102 The Czech physiologist Vilem Laufberger noted in 1937 that ferritin could be crystallized in situ by adding droplets of concentrated cadmium sulfate to fresh slices of horse spleen.103 The crystal structures of horse spleen ferritin, rat liver ferritin, and recombinant rat L-chain ferritin \u2013 all crystallized in the presence of CdSO4 \u2013 revealed intermolecular crystal packing via double Cd2+ bridges, with pairs of aspartate and glutamine side chains from neighboring ferritin molecules forming ligands to the metal ions.104, 105, 106 Human and other H-rich ferritins, on the other hand, immediately form amorphous precipitate upon the addition of Cd2+, even at low concentrations.107 Sequence comparisons revealed that human H ferritin contained a lysine in place of the Cd2+-coordinating glutamine residue. By constructing a Lys\u2192Gln mutant of recombinant human ferritin, large well-diffracting crystals isomorphous to those of the horse and rat ferritins were obtained. Surprisingly, these crystals could only be grown in the presence of Ca2+, although subsequent structure determination revealed that the two Ca2+ ions formed an identical intermolecular coordination arrangement as Cd2+ in the horse and rat ferritins.102\n",

            "text": "The general utility of metal ions and organometallic compounds to induce macromolecular crystal growth by forming metal-mediated crystal contacts cannot be overstated, and a growing number of success stories documenting this fact continue to fill the literature. The practice of using metal ions in protein crystallization dates as far back as 1925 when John J. Abel \u2013 perhaps fortuitously at first \u2013 used Zn2+ to obtain rhombohedral crystals of insulin.108 In our laboratory, Zn2+ remains the divalent cation of choice for crystallization additive screening, with examples including the Zn2+-mediated crystallization of the macrophage infectivity potentiator protein from Legionella pneumophila,109 and a human carbonic anhydrase (TH, unpublished) (Figure 6\n). It should be emphasized, however, that Zn2+ will not be the best crystallization additive for every protein, and provided that enough protein sample is available, parallel screening of different metal salts is recommended. To illustrate this, a study examining the influence of various divalent cations on the crystallization of isoleucine/valine-binding protein and leucine-specific binding protein led to the observation that different metals promoted different crystal forms, with Cd2+ producing the best results.110 This and a subsequent study with histidine-binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium also found that the optimal metal concentration for crystallization fell within a very narrow range.111 It is as yet impossible to predict a priori which type of metal or organometallic complex, nor which concentration range (\u03bcM\u2013M), will be most suitable for crystallizing a given protein; however, the remarkable propensity of Zn2+ to exhibit a wide array of coordination geometries (4-, 5-, and 6-coordinate geometry both with and without additional weak interactions) and a broad range of potential protein ligand functions (Asp, Glu, His, Cys, main-chain carbonyl, and C-terminal carboxylate),112, 113 together with its utility for multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods,114 make it a logical first choice when metal-additive crystallization screening is considered (Figure 6). The Pfizer group has recently proposed engineering carboxylic protein surface residues (Asp and Glu) into proteins as a crystallization strategy to enable Zn2+-mediated crystal contacts.115\n",

            "text": "The mind-boggling number of possibilities that present themselves when considering site-directed mutagenesis as a tool for crystallizing a new target raises a few fundamental questions: which sites in the protein sequence should be chosen for mutagenesis, and what kind of mutation will produce the best results? For the most part, the strategy has until now remained trial-and-error in nature, and the relative paucity of empirical data on the subject still leaves much to be answered. For example, solubility and crystallization screening of about 30 different hydrophobic\u2192Lys point mutants of the catalytic domain of HIV integrase led to crystallization of the Phe185Lys mutant.122 In another case, obtainment of diffraction-quality crystals of the mycobacterial outer membrane channel was possible only after preparing about a dozen point mutants \u2013 either within zones of interspecies sequence variation or at predicted surface regions \u2013 of which an Ala96Arg mutant produced crystals diffracting to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution.123 A Trp100Glu point mutation in wild-type human leptin produced a soluble protein that crystallized and allowed structure determination to 2.4 \u00c5.124 A Lys133Ile mutant of cyclophilin D gave crystals that diffracted to 1.7 \u00c5 resolution.125 What becomes clear at this point is there has been no real consensus on what works best; however, recent work by Zygmunt Derewenda's group has illustrated the consistent effectiveness of incorporating mutations that reduce conformational surface entropy.117, 126 The underlying concept stems from the idea that surface residues with high conformational entropy create an \u2018entropic shield\u2019 that prevents the formation of stable intermolecular interactions required for crystal contact formation. Therefore, the selective replacement of conformationally labile surface residues with small amino acids, such as Ala, could reduce the entropic penalty of crystal contact formation in these regions. Lysine and glutamate residues have been identified as good candidates for mutagenic replacement because they are usually located on the protein surface,127 their side chains are typically characterized by high conformational entropy,128 and they are disfavored at protein\u2212protein interfaces.129 The hypothesis was emphatically validated by mutational work on RhoGDI, the human Rho-specific GDP dissociation inhibitor, of which several mutants were constructed (each containing between one and four Lys\u2192Ala and/or Glu\u2192Ala exchanges) and subjected to crystallization trials.130, 131 Almost all mutants exhibited altered crystallization properties and several new crystal forms were obtained, with one Glu154Ala/Glu155Ala double-mutant producing crystals that diffracted to 1.25 \u00c5 resolution.131 Crystal structure determinations of the different mutants revealed that the mutated epitopes participated directly in crystal contact formation. This surface engineering strategy has since produced successful results for a number of proteins, and the current trend involves making multiple mutations within short Lys/Glu-rich clusters.117, 126 A recent example of this approach toward SBDD is provided by work from Merck scientists who investigated the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), an anticancer target. Crystals of the unphosphorylated apo form of the IGF-1R kinase domain diffracted to only 2.7 \u00c5 resolution, a resolution which is too low for high-throughput structure-based lead optimization. To overcome this hurdle, three different multiple mutants were prepared, Lys1025Ala/Lys1026Ala, Glu1067Ala/Glu1069Ala, and Lys1237Ala/Glu1238Ala/Glu1239Ala, with the second double-mutant producing high-quality crystals diffracting to 1.5 \u00c5 resolution.132 In the event that the solubility of the mutant protein is critically compromised, alternative mutations to polar residues with less conformational entropy and/or smaller size (e.g., Lys\u2192Arg; Lys\u2192Asp) can also help to promote crystallization.133, 134 The concept of rationally designing proteins to crystallize has been extended by Wingren and colleagues who have shown it is possible to replace short stretches of residues in \u03b2-strand-containing proteins with so-called packing \u2018cassettes\u2019 \u2013 crystal packing motifs that promote crystallization by generating specific crystal packing interactions.135 As with any mutational work, the functional integrity of the mutant proteins needs to be evaluated prior to SBDD.",

Mutants can be expressed as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and visibly assayed for solubility and proper folding. The great advantage of the GFP-based directed evolution approach compared to rational surface-engineering is that it eliminates all of the guesswork related to mutant design and samples mutational space in a much more efficient way. Yang and co-workers demonstrated the superior utility of GFP-based directed evolution for obtaining soluble and crystallizable mutants of the protein RV2002 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.137 Mutants of RV2002 generated by GFP-based directed evolution had solubilities of at least \u223c15 mg mL\u22121, compared to the wild-type protein, which was expressed in E. coli only as insoluble inclusion bodies. An important observation raised by the authors in their crystallographic study was that the underlying contributions of the individual mutations toward the enhanced solubility of the Ile6Thr/Val47Met/Thr69Lys triple mutant appeared to involve a combination of altered intrinsic solubility and folding kinetics.137 It is very likely that it would have been much more difficult, if not impossible, to rationally engineer soluble mutants as quickly or effectively.",

            "text": "An alternative strategy that deserves consideration before embarking on the more time-consuming approaches of ortholog screening, rational surface engineering, or directed evolution (or perhaps even as a final recourse in the event that the above methods fail) is to chemically modify the target protein prior to crystallization. Reductive alkylation of the protein sample with formaldehyde and dimethylamine-borane complex (DMAB) has proven to be the most successful chemical treatment strategy established thus far for crystallization of recalcitrant samples. Although the technique was originally used to improve the quality of poorly diffracting crystals, its use as a tool for de novo crystallization was pioneered by Ivan Rayment for the structure determination of myosin subfragment 1,138 and a methylation protocol of general utility has been subsequently published.139 The net consequence of this treatment is the dimethylation of all solvent-accessible lysine side chains as well as the N-terminal amino group. The resulting charge of the modified protein is not changed, however, its isoelectric point may be shifted slightly. As with surface-entropy-reducing mutagenesis, it is believed that the crystallizability of the chemically modified target may be enhanced as a result of reduced side chain entropy of dimethylated lysines. Additional studies have demonstrated that methylated proteins can produce novel crystal forms differing from unmodified samples,140, 141 and that selenomethionine-substituted specimens as well as multimeric complexes are amenable to this form of chemical treatment.142 Other chemical approaches for the purpose of crystallization remain less explored, although a recent study has demonstrated the utility of deliberate oxidation in this regard. Working on a bacterial Ppx/GppA phosphatase homolog, Kristensen and co-workers were able to obtain two unique crystal forms after incubating their protein samples with 0.1% H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature prior to crystallization. The oxidized crystal forms were unique and were found to exhibit increased physical stability and better diffraction compared to the crystal form obtained with untreated samples.143\n",

            "text": "One of the major disappointments regularly encountered in an SBDD program employing crystallography is the realization that crystals of the protein target are of poor quality and unsuitable for diffraction studies. The phenomena of low-resolution or poor-quality diffraction (e.g., characterized by severe mosaicity or anisotropy) usually stems from loose molecular packing within the crystal and/or a high internal solvent content. These symptoms often arise from crystals that otherwise appear to be physically perfect when viewed under the light microscope, adding to a researcher's frustration and invariably leading to serious doubts about proceeding with the project. Before capitulating, however, there are several postcrystallization treatments at hand that can improve the diffraction quality of protein crystals, sometimes drastically.144 The most successful methods currently employed for improving diffraction quality at this stage are crystal dehydration and \u2018crystal annealing.\u2019 The latter method arose as a way to repair crystal lattice damage inflicted by flash-cooling techniques (rapid cooling of crystals to cryogenic temperatures),145, 146 which are routinely used to limit crystal radiation damage induced by exposure to high-intensity x-ray sources.147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155 Crystal annealing involves warming a flash-cooled crystal to room temperature followed by repeated flash cooling, and has been shown to improve crystal mosaicity and diffraction resolution.156, 157 The method of crystal dehydration effectively reduces crystal solvent content, enforcing tighter crystal packing and frequently promoting remarkable improvements in diffraction quality. Several dehydration methods have emerged, ranging from slow controlled dehydration of the crystallization droplet over a period of days or weeks, to quick crystal soaks in a dehydrating solution for a few minutes. A novel device has been described that allows accurate control of crystal water content by regulating the relative humidity of a gas stream enveloping the crystal.158 This device, which is now available commercially, allows the diffraction properties of the crystal to be monitored in real time while the crystal is dehydrated until diffraction is improved. A recent study has demonstrated that the method of fast crystal dehydration coupled with crystal annealing can lead to astonishing improvements in diffraction quality, sometimes extending the diffraction limit of some apparently worthless crystal specimens by nearly tenfold.159 Other postcrystallization treatments for improving diffraction resolution, including crystal soaking and crystal cross-linking, have been reviewed recently.144\n",

            "text": "As mentioned, cryocrystallography is the method of choice when collecting diffraction data at high-intensity X-ray sources due to its dampening effect on the diffusion of harmful free radicals through the crystal, allowing most crystals to survive long enough in the x-ray beam for collection of a complete single-crystal high-resolution data set. A critical objective of cryocrystallography is the formation of amorphous ice within and around the crystal upon cryocooling, as crystalline ice formation yields spurious diffraction that obscures the useful protein diffraction. Amorphous ice formation can be facilitated by the addition of chemical cryoprotectants, such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol, to the crystallization mother liquor.154, 160 Sometimes the crystallization mother liquor will already contain a cryoprotective formulation of reagents, thereby facilitating the cryocooling of crystals directly from their growth solutions. Several commercial crystallization screening kits containing cryo-ready reagents have been developed based on this strategy.161 One possible unwanted side effect with regard to SBDD, however, is the proclivity of cryoprotectant molecules to appear in the active sites of enzymes, in which case the screening of alternative cryoprotectants might be needed. A plausible workaround, which can eliminate the need for conventional cryoprotectants, is the use of cryoprotective oils such as Paratone-N or highly liquid paraffin oil, which work by forming a protective shield around the crystal.148, 162, 163 Another cooling method that circumvents the need for penetrative cryoprotectants is high-pressure crystal cooling, which was first explored as early as 1973164 and recently revisited.165, 166 A prototype pressure device has been constructed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) that allows for cryo-loop crystal mounting and high-pressure (200 MPa) cryocooling. Preliminary results with the device, which have shown significant improvement of diffraction quality for all protein crystals studied, are very encouraging.166\n",

            "text": "When preexisting structural data is absent or insufficient for molecular replacement phasing, other methods must be employed. Historically, the most commonly used structure-solving technique was multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), which relies on the preparation of derivative crystals in which one or more types of heavy atoms are bound specifically and uniformly to the macromolecules within the crystal. The outcome of the MIR method is additionally contingent on the heavy-atom derivatives being truly isomorphous, i.e., bearing no (or at most, extremely limited) alterations in molecular structure and unit-cell dimensions. Successful phase determination by MIR is consequently rate-limited by the speed with which suitable heavy-atom derivatives can be obtained. The advancement of multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing114, 173 and the construction of tunable synchrotron x-ray beamlines worldwide have made multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion the method of choice for experimental phase determination, particularly for high-throughput (HT) SBDD applications. One of the big advantages multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing offers over MIR and related methods such as SIRAS and MIRAS (single or multiple-isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) is the reduction of systematic error since all data are measured on a single sample. The resulting phase angles are therefore more accurately determined and the resulting electron density maps are typically of higher quality than maps calculated with phases derived from isomorphous methods. Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing requires the presence of a suitable number of atoms having an x-ray absorption edge in the energy range easily accessible by tunable synchrotron sources (typically \u03bb=0.8\u20131.3 \u00c5). Most multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing experiments are carried out using selenomethionine-substituted (SeMet) proteins,174, 175 although sometimes SeMet multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing can be an inappropriate method for phase determination.176 In such situations, multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing can be carried out with bound elements of atomic numbers \u223c20\u201340 (or above \u223c60), as they have synchrotron-accessible absorption edges. These elements can often be found as natural metal cofactors in proteins (such as transition metals) or can be diffused into protein crystals using conventional heavy-atom soaking methods.177, 178, 179, 180 Prescreening for the degree of SeMet or heavy atom incorporation into the target protein can be rapidly carried out by mass spectrometry.181 Alternatively, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments allow for a quick and simple assessment of heavy atom binding, optimal binding concentrations, and impact on protein stability.182\n",

For example, chemically modified ligands can be used as rational phasing tools, such as halogenated nucleotides for multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of nucleotide-binding proteins183 or selenium-substituted saccharides for carbohydrate-binding proteins.184 Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with krypton has been demonstrated as a feasible technique,185 as has cryosoaking with halides186, 187 or mono- and polyvalent cations.188, 189 Several other unique procedures for producing derivatives have appeared over the years and continued exploration in this field will surely generate additional phasing alternatives. Moreover, modern developments in the area of utilizing soft x-rays (\u03bb=1.5\u20133.0 \u00c5) for sulfur-based anomalous phasing \u2013 a technique pioneered more than 20 years ago by Hendrickson & Teeter for the structure determination of crambin190 \u2013 may eventually circumvent the need for derivatization in most cases altogether.191, 192, 193, 194\n",

            "text": "In order for a compound to be of value to SBDD, it must be present at a high enough concentration in the crystallization drop to promote a high occupancy of binding to the target and therefore produce interpretable electron density. A source of difficulty can be limited ligand solubility, which can impose a constraint on binding occupancy and limit the usefulness of the crystallographic data. If something is known about the target:ligand dissociation constant, K\nD, the problem can be approached using the formula [ligand=[protein]+nK\nD, where [ligand] and [protein] are the concentrations in the crystallization drop, and n is an \u2018excess factor.\u2019 When K\nD\u2aa1[protein], for example, when a ligand with a K\nD in the low micromolar range is added to a drop containing a millimolar concentration of protein, then [ligand]\u2245[protein]. In this case, maximum binding occupancy should be achieved by adding only a slight molar excess of ligand. On the other hand, when the protein is crystallized at low concentration and/or a low affinity ligand is used (i.e., K\nD\u2245[protein]), then the nK\nD term becomes appreciable. A general guideline is to use an n value of at least 5\u201310, although trial-and-error comes into play here. An added complication is that the above calculation relies on the assumption that the measured K\nD under assay conditions is similar to the K\nD in the crystallization drop, which is very likely untrue. For a polar ligand, high salt concentrations will normally raise the K\nD in the crystallization drop, while the opposite will be true for nonpolar ligands. Potentially adding to the puzzle is the effect of cryoprotectants and cosolvents, such as polyethylene glycol, which have been known to sometimes interfere with ligand binding by competing for the ligand-binding site. All considered, a \u2018more is better\u2019 philosophy for ligand soaking is often adhered to, however poorly soluble ligands may require the use of a suitable organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, methanol, or hexafluoropropanol.180\n",

With this approach, a preliminary HTS assay is used at a compound concentration of \u223c200 \u03bcM for the initial selection of candidates. The target protein is then crystallized in the presence of 1 mM of the scaffold molecule, with ranges of pH, precipitants, and additives screened to help increase the chances of co-crystallization. The authors reported an overall co-crystallization success rate of 85% for the 316 chemical scaffolds selected for structural studies with different PDEs.196\n",

These subsequent steps can be subdivided into four distinct categories: fragment optimization; fragment linking; fragment evolution; and fragment self-assembly198 (Figure 8\n). In fragment evolution, a lead molecule is iteratively generated, or \u2018evolved\u2019, by building away from the starting fragment into other regions of the binding pocket. Fragment linking defines the process of chemically joining two fragments that bind adjacent sites to generate a larger compound with greater potency. Fragment optimization involves altering properties of a lead molecule including selectivity or efficacy, such as a \u2018SAR by x-ray\u2019 approach.211 The method of fragment self-assembly utilizes mixtures of fragments adorned with reactive groups (so-called \u2018dynamic combinatorial libraries\u2019212), which link together when situated in close proximity (e.g., within a target's active site) (see\n3.42 Dynamic Ligand Assembly). In this way, the target catalyzes the synthesis of its own \u2013 and presumably highest affinity \u2013 lead from a library of fragments. An x-ray-guided extension to fragment self-assembly, termed \u2018dynamic combinatorial x-ray crystallography\u2019 (DCX), allows self-assembled leads to be generated from dynamic combinatorial libraries in the presence of protein crystals, permitting direct observation of the binding interaction with the target.213\n",

Advances in task automation, miniaturization, and parallelization have ushered in a new era of \u2018high-throughput crystallography.\u2019 The original notion of high-throughput crystallography was not conceived by the pharmaceutical sector (which had diminishing interests in x-ray crystallography and was instead focusing on other HT technologies), but by the structural genomics initiatives that were established with the goal of solving crystal structures of representatives from all known protein families (see\n3.25 Structural Genomics).214, 215 Such ambitious goals bore the immediate need to establish new methodologies for producing hundreds of proteins in parallel, for creating HT systems to dispense and monitor thousands of crystallization experiments per day, and for determining the resultant x-ray structures in a fully automated fashion.

Because the probability of success is exponentially related to the number of independent protein-target variants screened, diversification should be emphasized at the stages of gene construct design, choice of expression system, and selection of affinity tags. Available biochemical, biophysical, and bioinformatical data should be exploited during the design of deletion/truncation mutants. Achievement of the first major milestone is commonly regarded as the obtainment of pure, homogeneous, monodisperse, and highly soluble samples of one or more recombinant proteins. Samples that fail to meet quality criteria can often be rescued by implementing feedback loops that incorporate different screening and optimization procedures such as high-throughput solubility screening. If extensive crystallization screening fails to produce initial crystal \u2018hits,\u2019 contingency pathways should be followed that involve modification protocols such as site-directed mutagenesis or directed evolution.",
