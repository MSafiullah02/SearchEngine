Advanced maternal age is more commonly seen in those with maternal disomy 15. Environmental factors (e.g., drug use, occupational chemical exposure, infectious agents, and irradiation) could account for chromosome changes.

Certain occupations such as hydrocarbon-exposing occupations (e.g., landscaping, farming, and painting) and viral exposure (e.g., human coronavirus 229E causing upper respiratory infections in adults with an incorporation site in the human genome at chromosome 15q11) can be seasonal in nature and contribute to chromosome damage. To assess, we reviewed birth seasonality data in a large cohort of individuals with PWS recruited nationally (N = 355) but no significant differences were seen by month between those with the 15q11-q13 deletion compared with maternal disomy 15 when analyzing quarterly seasonal patterns.

These birth seasonality findings showed an over-representation of deliveries in the fall with underrepresentation in the winter months supporting a possible environmental influence, seasonal in nature (e.g., December, January, February) on male meiosis prior to conception", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": ". However, February showed the second to highest number of births in the deletion subtype group and the lowest number for maternal disomy 15. The number of births observed in the fall months (N = 22) were less than one-half the number of births observed in the spring months (N = 45) while the number of births observed in the deletion group was similar in all four seasons. Potential environmental factors could play a role with contributions of age as older mothers are overrepresented in those families with PWS children having maternal disomy 15 due to non-disjunction (Butler et al., 2019). The maturation of sperm occurs in fathers~2 months prior to conception and may be impacted by seasonal factors (e.g., viruses) or by inhibiting chromosome 15 nondisjunction events in female gametogenesis, particularly in meiosis I (Butler et al., 2009). Advanced maternal age and chromosome nondisjunction are reported in other numerical chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Further investigations are needed as to whether environmental factors could contribute to chromosome 15 defects and/or chromosomal nondisjunction events in PWS. Similar investigations which are beyond the scope of this report could be undertaken and encouraged in Angelman syndrome, a second genomic imprinting disorder involving the same chromosome 15q11-q13 deletion but of maternal origin, paternal disomy 15, chromosome 15 imprinting defects, or UBE3A gene mutations (Dagli, Buiting, & Williams, 2012). A comparison of an Angelman syndrome dataset may be fruitful to further address birth seasonality in imprinted disorders including a lower number of births in the month of February seen in PWS with maternal disomy 15 but not reaching a level of significance.
