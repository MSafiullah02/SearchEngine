In many cases, the etiologic agent cannot be determined using traditional diagnostic methods and may result in unnecessary antibiotic use or prolonged periods of illness. Molecular tests provide many advantages over traditional laboratory methods but, with the exception of a few analytes, are still largely in the developmental phase for gastrointestinal pathogens and are not widely used. The main advantages of molecular tests include increased sensitivity and the ability to detect agents which will not grow in culture. To test for all possible gastrointestinal pathogens at one time would require a large panel that would include a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. Challenges inherent in developing diagnostic molecular panels include ensuring that all variants of a particular microorganism can be detected as well as the rapid evolution of pathogens. In this chapter, the diagnostic merit of molecular tests as well as available tests will be presented for the major groups of gastrointestinal pathogens.",

Culture and identifi cation of enteric pathogens is cost-effective but can take several days to provide a diagnosis. Culture has some limitations and it is especially diffi cult to distinguish nonpathogenic from pathogenic strains of E. coli .

Two regulatory genes, tcdC and tcdD , are hypothesized to negatively infl uence the expression of tcdA and tcdB , and together with the toxin genes are part of the chromosomally encoded region known as the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) [ 8 ] .",

Epidemiologic studies revealed a high percentage of cases were caused by a strain referred to as BI/NAP1/027, named in reference to typing results for restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), pulsed fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and PCR-ribotyping, respectively. The BI/ NAP1/027 strain carries 18-bp and 1-bp (nt 117) deletions within the tcdC gene, and these deletions are speculated to result in the formation of an abnormal tcdC protein with a loss of regulatory function [ 13 ] . The resultant loss of negative regulation may lead to an increase in toxin formation and greater virulence [ 13 ] . Supporting this theory is the observation that isolates of the BI/NAP1/027 strain produce increased amounts of toxin A and B in vitro [ 15 ] . An additional toxin known as the binary toxin CDT is present in the BI/NAP1/027 strain as well as 6 % of C. diffi cile isolates, and is encoded by two chromosomal genes, cdtA and cdtB , located outside of the PaLoc [ 13 ] . Although production of the binary toxin is associated with the more virulent BI/ NAP1/027 strain, its role in pathogenesis is not well established [ 8 , 16 ] .",

The diversity of tests available makes possible a number of diagnostic algorithms. None of these testing strategies has performed optimally to date, leading a number of investigators to suggest the adoption of the highly sensitive and specifi c PCR-based assays. Several studies have evaluated the effects of implementing nucleic acid testing. Algorithms examined include PCR assays as confi rmatory tests of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-positive samples, as refl ex tests for GDHpositive, toxin-enzyme immunoassays (EIA) negative samples, and as stand-alone assays for direct testing of stool samples. A comparison of these testing algorithms to those using toxin-EIA only, GDH followed by toxin-EIA, and GDH/toxin-EIA followed by cell culture cytotoxin neutralization (CCCN) testing of toxin-EIA negative samples indicates a clear trade-off between sensitivity and cost [ 17 ] . The cost per test for all strategies using PCR-based assays was signifi cantly greater than the most expensive non-PCR-based testing algorithm ($35.22 vs $24.41, respectively) [ 17 ] . However, strategies using PCR as confi rmation of GDHpositive samples or as a refl ex test for GDH-positive, toxin-EIA negative samples detected an additional 89 toxigenic C. diffi cile samples over a 1 year period that were missed by algorithms using traditional testing methods [ 17 ] . Furthermore, stand-alone, direct PCR testing of stool samples detected an additional 138 positive specimens missed by even the most sensitive non-PCR-based testing algorithm. Importantly, all diagnostic strategies using PCR provided results for the majority of samples (>83.7 %) in less than 1 h and in less than 5 h for the remainder [ 17 ] . These rapid turn-around times are in contrast to algorithms relying on CCCN as a refl ex test for GDH-positive, toxin-EIA negative samples, which required as long as 48 h for 12.3 % of samples tested [ 17 ] .",

In addition, rapid detection allows for the timely institution of treatment and possibly shortened hospital stays.

The results confi rm the poor performance of strategies relying solely on GDH/toxin-EIA testing as the number of patients placed in isolation with true CDI nearly matches the numbers of patients without the disease [ 16 ] . Furthermore, 45 patients with CDI are not identifi ed, and therefore, are not placed into proper infection control isolation [ 16 ] . Algorithms that refl ex to toxigenic culture or CCCN after GDH/toxin-EIA testing detect more cases of CDI, but still produce high numbers of false-positive results (55 patients). Using toxigenic culture as a refl ex test produced values for sensitivity and specifi city statistically equivalent to PCR-based refl ex testing; however, the length of time required to produce fi nal results would likely lead to excessive costs. Using PCR-based assays as stand-alone tests detected the greatest number of CDI cases (95 %) , and led to the unnecessary isolation of only 36 patients [ 16 ] . While these results further confi rm the superior diagnostic performance of nucleic acid testing either as a refl ex test for GDHpositive, toxin-EIA negative samples or as a stand-alone method, the authors of the study recommend additional investigations examining the cost-effectiveness of these strategies [ 16 ] .",

These methods generally demonstrate excellent sensitivities and specifi cities, and most assays are capable of delivering results in 1-3 h [ 16 ] . Several tests are US FDA-cleared, and additional assays will likely become commercially available in the near future. At this time all US FDA-cleared assays are qualitative, although quantitative testing is technologically possible with real-time PCR. Most US FDA-cleared assays are based on real-time PCR. However, other novel methods such as helicase-dependent amplifi cation (HDA) and loopmediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) also are employed. In addition, the majority of commercially available real-time PCR assays target solely the tcdB gene. US FDA-cleared multiplex PCR assays target tcdB as well as variable tcdA , tcdC , and cdt gene sequences and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene associated with the 027/NAP1/B1 strain. Initial studies evaluating these US FDA-cleared assays are promising; however, the 2010 Update by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America stated the need for further studies before recommending molecular assays for routine testing [ 8 ] . Lastly, CDI screening also may be performed using the US FDA-cleared xTAG \u00ae Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation), a multiplex test that simultaneously detects 11 gastrointestinal pathogens including C. diffi cile and other major bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Published reports evaluating the US FDA-cleared version of this assay are currently lacking.",

Each species group contains several serotypes classifi ed by neutralization reactions to specifi c antisera [ 97 ] . At present, over 50 serotypes have been described [ 98 ] . Serotype groups may be further subdivided into genomic types. Genotypes are assigned lowercase letters to differentiate them from the prototype strain as indicated by the letter \"p\" [ 97 ] . Interspecies DNA sequence variation may be as low as 4 % whereas genotypes within an adenovirus species may be 50 % to nearly 100 % homologous [ 99 , 100 ] .

Isolation of specifi c adenovirus serotypes from the gastrointestinal tract, such as 1, 2, 5, and 6, may raise concern for the possibility of disseminated disease since these serotypes have been documented to cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients [ 107 ] . On the other hand, serotypes 40 and 41, while frequently isolated in cases of gastroenteritis, have not been recovered from immunocompromised patients with disseminated infections [ 107 ] . While conventional serotyping methods may take up to several weeks [ 97 ] , molecular methods such as PCR have improved turnaround times and allow for the characterization of isolates at the species, serotype, and genotype level [ 107 ] . Molecular and serological typing results usually are concordant [ 97 ] .",

Rotaviruses are very stable in the environment and can remain infectious for several weeks. They have a triple-layered structure with concentric capsid layers that surround a core which contains the genome. The surface of the outermost capsid layer contains two major structural viral proteins, VP4, a protease-cleaved protein (P protein), and VP7, a glycoprotein (G protein). The middle layer of the capsid contains structural protein VP6. The inner capsid layer contains proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of doublestranded RNA with a complete genome length of 16,500-21,000 nucleotides. The genomes can reassort during dual infection of a single cell which results in co-circulation of a wide variety of strains.",

Group B rotaviruses were fi rst identifi ed as causing adult diarrhea in a large waterborne epidemic in China. Serologic evidence indicates that Group B rotavirus is also present in the UK and the US, and genome profi les consistent with Group B rotavirus have been detected as causes of diarrhea in India [ 130 ] . Group C rotaviruses are an emerging cause of gastroenteritis in both children and adults and have been identifi ed in sporadic cases and outbreaks worldwide. The Group A rotaviruses are further classifi ed into serotypes based on neutralizing serologic reactions against the P (VP4) and G (VP7) proteins. Also, because the two gene segments that encode the P and G proteins segregate independently, a genotyping system has been developed based on the sequences of both genes. The most prevalent Group A rotavirus genotypes in humans are G1P [8] , G2P [4] , G3P [8] , G4P [8] , and G9P [8] . A Rotavirus Classifi cation Working Group has been formed to assist in classifi cation of any newly described rotavirus genotypes based on sequence information for all 11 genomic RNA segments.",

The highly variable nature of calicivirus genomes presents a signifi cant challenge to designing molecular assays for diagnostic use. The literature contains details of a variety of RT-PCR assays that have been used for the detection of human caliciviruses in diagnostic studies as well epidemiologic investigations of food, water, and other environmental samples. Some of the assays are designed to detect sapoviruses without cross-reactivity with noroviruses or rotaviruses. Among them is a quantitative real-time PCR assay using primers against the junction of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/capsid genes that has been described to detect sapovirus genogroups I, II, and IV with an analytical sensitivity of ten copies of viral cDNA per reaction [ 165 ] . Conventional qualitative RT-PCR assays that detect all genogroups of human sapoviruses have also been developed [ 166 ] . Nested RT-PCR assays that claim to be more sensitive than conventional PCR that detect and differentiate all genogroups of human sapovirus have been reported using primers against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region [ 167 ] or the capsid-protein coding region [ 168 ] . Molecular assays using various protocols and primer sets to detect noroviruses have been similarly described. Only a small region of approximately 50 base pairs at the polymerase (ORF-1)/ capsid (ORF2) junction of the norovirus genome appears to be suffi ciently conserved to detect all within-genogroup variants [ 169 -171 ] . Additional assays have been published that use multiple primers in a multiplex format to amplify the capsid region of the respective viral targets to simultaneously detect norovirus genogroups I and II, sapoviruses, and astroviruses [ 172 ] .",
