Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 90 pediatric patients with sepsis aged between 1 and 24 months. The virology department of our hospital processes all clinical specimens from pediatric departments. Airway secretions were obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab and analyzed using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) to detect viral pathogens within 72 hours of initiation of antibiotic therapy. Patients who died during the treatment were included in the assessment as infection\u2010related mortality if the death had been caused by the infection.14 All samples from infants aged between 1 and 24 months with suspected sepsis received at the microbiology laboratory and tested for respiratory virus infections during the study period were eligible for inclusion. Newborns, patients older than 24 months or without sepsis diagnosis were excluded.

Virus detection in pediatric departments is an important issue, which has been considered to contribute to successful antibiotic stewardship, provided that specific and ratified algorithms can be implemented in the clinical route.16 Although evidence is still lacking that the use of multiplex RT\u2010PCR to detect respiratory viruses provides a medical or economic benefit to pediatric patients, potential benefits from virus detection may arise from the early implementation of effective isolation, infection control measures to prevent the viral spread, and also to prevent the use of unnecessary antibiotics. The frequency of RVIs observed in this study seemed to be twice as much as the proven bacterial sepsis. However, the distinction between viral and bacterial sepsis with clinical and/or laboratory findings is too difficult. Cases with RVIs could not be differentiated from cases with positive bacterial blood culture or those with clinical sepsis by clinical presentation. But, RVIs generally presented with respiratory symptoms, albeit their clinical characteristics, were heterogeneous. When compared with bacterial infections, the only cough occurred more than in viral infections. Our study adds to the view that white blood count and C\u2010reactive protein are not suitable to differentiate bacterial from viral infections. On the other hand, thrombocytopenia was more common in cases with proven bacterial infections. A decrease in thrombocyte count is often seen in patients who developed severe sepsis as well as the development of thrombocytopenia during a septic episode, which is recognized to be associated with mortality and morbidity.17, 18 Therefore, bacterial sepsis should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with thrombocytopenia and clinical sepsis findings.",

In our study, patients had bacterial sepsis who had the longest duration of hospitalization (median; 28 days), although pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay rates and infection\u2010related mortality rates were not different between groups. There was the statistically significant difference between groups in terms of duration of hospitalization (P = 0.04). This could be related that patients with bacteremia had longer antibiotic treatment duration. In addition to this, patients with RVIs had same infectious mortality rate and PICU stay rate showed us that we should consider patients with sepsis in terms RVIs due to the same rate of mortality and PICU stay. Miggins et al investigated critically ill patients in the USA and detected that viral infections may play a significant yet unrecognized role in overall outcomes of ICU patients.28 In our study, hRV and influenza were the most commonly seen viruses with the rate of 16.7% and 7.8%, respectively (Figure 1). It was reported that influenza causes an increased risk of sepsis in the literature.28 Also, we know that hRV are associated with severe respiratory infections in patients with immunocompromised or chronic lung disease.29 Sepsis caused by hRV is rarely reported by now. Kim et al stated that 17% of patients had sepsis from all of the patients with confirmed hRV infection.30 Also, we had few patients with prematurity or congenital cardiac disease in which underlying diseases are a risk for RSV infection. Taking the detection rates of each RVIs, it is possible to conclude that infection by some viruses can lead to clinical findings of sepsis in infants. The results show that the identification of RVs in infants with sepsis is frequent and this is really important for several reasons such as respiratory isolation and specific therapeutics as in influenza infections. However, the study design does not allow inferring in a causal relationship since there is no control group without sepsis. It is possible that in some cases the identified viruses are not the cause of the symptoms. It is also possible that in the cases which received antibiotics before the collection of blood cultures, the cause of the infection might still be bacteria, even when in RVs detection.",

RVIs were seen as similar between the groups. A study in critically ill patients showed that when a viral infection was present either alone or during the same hospitalization as a bacterial infection, it is associated with an increased risk of mortality, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, diarrhea, sepsis, and septic shock. This study also concluded that coincident infections showed the strong association with all adverse outcomes.26 In our study, duration of hospitalization, PICU stay, and infection\u2010related mortality death were similar, but there was the statistically significant difference between groups with regard to bacterial bloodstream infection rate (P = 0.001).",

Another limitation is that we did not obtain respiratory samples specifically at the beginning of clinical findings of sepsis in our outpatient population, we were able to collect the specimens upon admission to the emergency department.

This could solve with a prospective study with serial quantitative PCR analyses in asymptomatic, septic, and ill but nonseptic children. We believe that our conclusion, which is having significant viral etiology in patients with sepsis is underdiagnosed by clinicians, is warranted.
