In this study, we investigated the gene expression of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Lung cancer patients in each age stage, subtype, and pathological stage are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the primitive subtype of LUSC. LUAD patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than LUSC patients. The findings are unanimous on tissue expression in gene and protein levels.",

We investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their associations with prognosis in two common lung cancers, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).

ACE2 gene expression in each pathological stage of LUAD was no different (F-val = 0.634, Fig. 1a) ; likewise, in LUSC, it was also no different (F-val = 0.589, Fig.  1b ). TMPRSS2 gene expression in each pathological stage of LUAD showed obvious differences (F-val = 5.54, Fig. 1c ), but in LUSC, it did not vary (F-val = 1.94, Fig.  1d ). The data show that changes in the expression of these two genes had no statistical significance, which suggests that the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are expressed consistently in each pathological stage of lung cancer, except for TMPRSS2 in LUAD. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among the pathological stages of LUAD and LUSC. TMPRSS2 maybe a cancer suppressor gene in LUAD, the downregulated expression level may decrease the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for LUAD patients.",
