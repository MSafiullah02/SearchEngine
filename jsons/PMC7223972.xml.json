The role of deficiencies of the components of the lectin pathway (LP) on predisposition to infection and autoimmunity is controversial [3]. The LP is triggered by the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), mannose-binding lectin (MBL); ficolin-1, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3; and collectin (CL)-10 and CL-11 after binding to surfaces displaying various arrays of carbohydrates or acetyl groups [3]. These PRMs circulate in heterocomplexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which initiate the proteolytic cascade of the LP after binding of the PRM to their ligands. There are three MASPs, MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3. MASP-2 is, together with MASP-1, indispensable for the activation of the LP (Fig. 1) [3\u20135]. Both activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 can cleave C2, but C4 is cleaved only by MASP-2. In the absence of MASP-1 or MASP-2, the classical C3 convertase C4bC2a cannot be generated through the LP, and no LP activation is observed.",

This patient, who was totally deficient in LP activity, was found to be homozygous for a mutation in exon 3 of the MASP2 gene (rs72550870, p.D120G, c.359A > G). This mutation results in a significant decrease in serum levels of the protein, reaching very low levels in homozygous individuals [6, 7].

            "text": "The study of individuals with PID has proven to be an important source of information on the relevance of the affected molecules in humans in nature [23]. The first case of MASP-2 deficiency, described in 2003 by Stengaard-Pedersen et al [6], suggested that this was a new monogenic defect underlying an autosomal recessive immunodeficiency, predisposing to severe infections and autoimmunity. It is worth noting that this individual also showed low levels of C1q (with presence of anti-C1q autoantibodies), C3, and C4 and severely impaired classical and alternative pathways activity. This patient was identified when sera from 125 patients with suspected PID were analyzed for MBL-dependent LP activity deficiency [6, 22]. Ten additional p.D120G homozygous patients (three children and seven adults), with a heterogeneous range of diseases, have been identified by chance in subsequent association studies [11\u201318] (Table 3). However, nine healthy individuals (two children and seven adults) homozygous for p.D120G have also been found by chance in genetic association studies [7, 9, 13, 17, 19\u201321, and this study]. Taken together, these findings suggest that MASP-2 deficiency no longer fulfills the premise that to establish a causal relationship between a genotype and a clinical phenotype, the genotype must not occur in healthy individuals [24]. Certainly, some PID show an incomplete penetrance, and healthy individuals with causative genotypes have been identified in familial studies. In any event, incomplete penetrance through life is the exception rather than the rule for most PID, particularly for those PID with autosomal recessive inheritance [23].",

C1q, C2, and C4 deficiencies are also included as PID but, in this case, with low susceptibility to pyogenic infection and to SLE. This seems paradoxical, since approximately 50% of C1q-deficient individuals present with significant infections by encapsulated bacteria, around 50% of those with C2 deficiency have invasive infections, particularly by pneumococcus, and 76% of C4 deficient patients suffer from recurrent respiratory infections, including pneumonia and meningitis [1, 26\u201328]. Likewise, 80\u201395%, 25%, and 76% of individuals with deficiency of C1q, C2, and C4, respectively, are diagnosed with SLE, and another 18% of C2-deficient patients suffer from undifferentiated connective tissue disease or vasculitis [1, 26\u201328].",

            "text": "Several deficiencies of other components of the LP may shed light on the role of MASP-2 deficiency and LP deficiencies in general, in the susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases. MBL deficiency was originally included in the classification of PID as a complement deficiency associated to pyogenic infections, although its very low clinical penetrance was stated [8]. More than 5% of individuals lack functional serum MBL, mostly due to homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for three common mutations in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene [3]. It was even proposed that the high worldwide frequencies of MBL-deficient alleles may be due to random drift, underscoring the evolutionary neutrality of MBL2 [29]. These data also suggested that MBL is largely redundant in human defenses [23, 29]. As further large studies were carried out, controversial data about the role of MBL deficiency in predisposition to severe infection, particularly to severe sepsis and to meningococcal and pneumococcal infection, were reported [3, 7, 23, 30\u201337]. Overall, although a role as a modifying factor cannot be excluded, the results suggest that the deficiency is mostly asymptomatic and, in 2011\u2019s update of PID [38], it was no longer included. Human and mouse CL-11, but not MBL, drive LP activation on the surface of S. pneumoniae and other bacteria, and it increases opsonophagocytosis [39\u201342]. Patients with autosomal recessive CL-11 or CL-10 deficiency suffer from Malpuech-Michels-Mingarelli-Carnevale (3MC) syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, genital, and often mental defects. However, CL-11- and CL-10-deficient patients, who lack CL-11 or CL-10 secretion, do not manifest a predisposition to infection, autoimmunity, or another immunological phenotype [41, 43\u201346]. Mutations at the MASP1 gene were also identified in patients with 3MC syndrome [41, 43, 45, 47, 48]. The MASP1 gene gives rise to three alternative splice products, MASP-1, MASP-3, and Map-44, which share the first eight exons. However the serine protease domains of MASP-1 (exons 13\u201318) and MASP-3 (exon 12) are coded by different exons (no serine protease domain is present in Map-44) [3\u20135]. Most mutations in MASP1 in patients with 3MC syndrome lie in the exon 12, unique to MASP-3. However, in nine patients, the mutations disrupt the three protein products [45\u201348]. Nevertheless, no infectious or autoimmune phenotype was documented in these patients despite the undetectable LP activity due to the absence of MASP-1 [48, 49]. The first patient with ficolin-3 deficiency was reported in 2009 when ficolin-3 levels were measured in a large series of patients with suspected immunodeficiencies [50]. The patient was an adult with recurrent respiratory tract infections and cerebral abscesses. However, he had underwent splenectomy at the age of 20 due to thrombocytopenia, and he had partial IgM deficiency and a low response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The deficiency was due to a mutation that is estimated to occur in homozygosity in 1/10,000 individuals. Ficolin-3 deficiency was also considered a PID associated to high susceptibility to recurrent pyogenic infections and to abscesses [2, 25]. Five additional patients with a rather heterogeneous range of clinical manifestations and a healthy control were later found by chance in association studies to have genetically proven ficolin-3 deficiency [51, 52]; a role as a predisposing factor for SLE was recently suggested [52]. Nevertheless, the first reported patient [50] was later diagnosed with genetically proven Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [3].",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. In our group of CAP patients, most individuals suffered from one only episode of CAP, and hence it does not represent a PID cohort. In addition, patients with a diagnosed PID were excluded from our study, and genetic or immunological studies aimed to the diagnosis of PID were not carried out to most, particularly adult, patients and controls. A role of MASP-2 deficiency as a potential disease modifier in individuals with additional inherited immune deficiencies or in patients with underlying diseases impairing immune defense mechanisms cannot be ruled out [3]. We cannot either rule out that some of the MASP-2-deficient individuals, even healthy controls, had not yet manifested the disease phenotype. In any event, health status was evaluated in at least four healthy controls aged 19 [20], 29 [13], 37 [9], and 39 [9] years. Remarkably, the 37-year-old healthy control female, a member of the hospital staff [9], is currently 51 years old, and she remains healthy. Conversely, an excess of LP activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury. Indeed, the LP, particularly MASP-2, may behave as a double-edged sword and be even detrimental in serious disease conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, and rheumatoid arthritis [4, 5, 41, 53]. Interestingly, increased levels of MASP-2 may contribute to poor disease outcome of pneumococcal meningitis [54]. Due to the low frequency of the studied variant, our study lacks statistical power to evaluate its association with outcome of CAP or IPD [7].",

Several PRM of the LP have been identified so far: mannose-binding lectin; ficolin-1, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3; and collectin (CL)-10 and CL-11. CL-10 and CL-11 were found to circulate as heteromeric complexes (CL-LK) of one CL-L1 and two CL-K1 polypeptide chains, able to activate the LP. The serine proteases that initiate the proteolytic cascade of the LP are the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which circulate in complex with the PRM. When the PRMs of the LP bind to the target surface, zymogen MASP-1 autoactivates first and then activates zymogen MASP-2. Both activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 can cleave C2, but C4 is cleaved only by MASP-2. In the absence of MASP-1 or MASP-2, the classical C3 convertase C4bC2a cannot be generated through the LP, and no LP activation is observed. MASP-3 is the primary physiological activator of pro-factor D under resting conditions in human blood, inducing the activation of the alternative pathway, which serves as an amplification loop for the classical and the lectin pathways. Activation of MASP-3 by MASP-1 and MASP-2 has been also proposed. In addition, it was recently shown that MASP-2 can directly cleave C3 in the absence of C4 and/or C2 on LP-activating surfaces [3\u20135].
