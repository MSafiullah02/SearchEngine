The only genotype found was the bovine type, which is common to animals and man, suggesting that C. parvum transmission is not necessarily a zoonosis, although zoonotic transmission can also occurs. Bovine play an important role as reservoirs for human cryptosporidiosis and also as a source of environmental contamination. Although viability studies with DAPI were not conclusive, oocysts were observed in water used for calves. This fact can contribute for the spread of animal cryptosporidiosis, environmental contamination and public health risks. Due to the small number of oocysts found in the water samples, determination of the isolates'genotype was not possible. Cryptosporidiosis study at Portugal needs to be pursuit by genotyping more isolates from faecal, animal (drinking water and farm effluent samples using other molecular markers.",
