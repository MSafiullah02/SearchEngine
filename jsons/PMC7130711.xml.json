I and my co-authors goal in this overview are to celebrate, provocate, instigate innovate and activate those in society who are in interested to contributing to the betterment of human and animal health through vaccination. For vaccination to have its greatest chance of working policy-relevant science for sustainable conservation in developing countries needs to address poverty (including lack of basic health care) in communities affected by conservation, and to consider costs and benefits (perceived or not) affecting the well-being of all stakeholders, from the local to the multinational. The need to return to and/or develop new education-based models for turning the tide from the heavily return-on-investment therapeutic era of the last century into one where the investment into the preventative sciences and medicine lead to sustainable cultural public health and economic changes of the future is never more evident than today. If the article gets the attention of researchers, educators/teachers, funders, policy makers, economists and the general public in both developed and developing countries to become involved in finding collaborative solutions to the conservation crisis than we will consider it a success.",

Along with basic understanding of germ theory and sanitation, vaccination, over the past 50 years, has transformed lives in both rich and poor countries\u2014resulting in the eradication of smallpox and huge reductions in the burden of previously common diseases such as polio, typhoid and measles. Immunization is particularly well suited to all countries including those with weak health systems, because it requires relatively less training and equipment and does not depend on skilled diagnosis, long-term drug regimens or extensive medical care. Immunization and sanitation remain as the most important public health modality responsible for improving the GNP of developing countries through additional gains in healthier children who are better educated and grow up to impact on their productivity. Like schoolchildren, healthier workers have better attendance rates and are more energetic and mentally robust. Workers in healthy communities, moreover, need to take less time off to care for sick relatives. Body size, which is greatly influenced by one\u2019s health during childhood, has been found to have large impacts on long-term productivity. Recent economists [1] have calculated that a 1-year increase in life expectancy improves labor productivity by 4%.",

Within that same month, it was reported in the Herald Tribune that a vaccination program, called the Measles Initiative, that was founded in 2001 by a consortium of health groups including the WHO, UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control and the American Red Cross resulted in death rates from measles in Africa dropping by more than 90% between 2000 and 2006. The drop from 396,000 deaths in 2000 to 36,000 in 2006\u2014achieved a World Health Organization goal 4 years ahead of schedule. In 2005, the WHO\u2019s Global Health Assembly had set a target of reducing global measles deaths by 90% by 2010.

From 2000 to 2006, the Measles Initiative spent $475 million to help 46 governments vaccinate close to five million children at \u223c$1/dose or $95/child total. Since World War II, vaccination has had a major impact on global health, as the following list of successes shows [1]:\u2022Smallpox, which had killed 2 million people per year until the late 1960s, was wiped out by 1979 after a massive worldwide immunization campaign.\u2022The number of polio cases fell from over 300,000 per year in the 1980s to just 2000 in 2002.\u2022Two-thirds of developing countries have eradicated neonatal tetanus.\u2022Since the launch of the World Health Organization\u2019s Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, the number of reported measles deaths has dropped from 6 million to less than 1 million per year.\u2022Whooping cough cases have fallen from 3 million per year to less than a quarter of a million.\u2022Diphtheria cases have declined from 80,000 in 1975 to less than 10,000 today.\u2022The haemophilus influenzae B (Hib) vaccine has reduced the incidence of Hib meningitis in Europe by 90% in 10 years.\n",

Veterinary medicine has responsibilities in biomedical research; ecosystem management; public health; food and agricultural systems; and care of companion animals, wildlife, exotic animals, and food animals. The expanding role of veterinarians at CDC reflects an appreciation for this variety of contributions. Veterinarians\u2019 educational background in basic biomedical and clinical sciences compare with that of physicians. However, unlike their counterparts in human medicine, veterinarians must be familiar with multiple species, and their training emphasizes comparative medicine. Veterinarians are competent in preventive medicine, population health, parsitology, zoonoses, and epidemiology, which serve them well for careers in public health. The history and tradition of the profession always have focused on protecting and improving both animal health and human health [7].",

The elimination of these livestock diseases, along with outstanding research in animal health, is key to the remarkable gains in the efficiency of U.S. animal production [7]. Partly as a consequence, U.S. residents spend only approximately 10% of their disposable income on food, whereas residents in other countries pay three or four times more [9]. Although this achievement is recognized to have added billions of dollars to other parts of the U.S. economy, its success in allowing the U.S. public access to a nutritious, affordable, and sustainable food supply \u2013 also important for the public\u2019s health and well-being \u2013 is far less appreciated. The success of the national brucellosis and tuberculosis elimination campaigns has benefited not only the U.S. livestock industries but also human health by substantially reducing these zoonotic threats in animals. Additional public health contributions can be attributed to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which has substantially reduced the burden of food-borne illnesses, improved food safety, and eliminated other zoonotic threats. Over the years, CDC has worked closely with USDA and the Food and Drug Administration to improve the safety of U.S. foods and reduce antimicrobial resistance in pathogens that infect both humans and animals.",

Some are part of the HHS National Disaster Medical Services and were deployed as the veterinary medical assistant teams (V-MATS) and supported the search and rescue in the World trade disaster. Additionally, since 1986, the AVMA and the College of American Pathologists have been working together to create a standard nomenclature that would allow veterinarians, physicians, and other medical professionals to create electronic medical records that use a common language. The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, SNOMED, was initially created by the college for human medicine but has since \u2013 through the partnership with AVMA \u2013 expanded to include veterinary terms. On July 1, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would make SNOMED available nationally at no charge, a step toward instituting a standardized electronic medical records system. The HHS signed a 5-year, $32.4 million contract with the college to license SNOMED and make it available nationally. The National Library of Medicine is administering the program. Prior to the HHS\u2019s agreement with the AVMA, practitioners in areas of practice nationally on the front line of surveillance would have had to pay a $2000 to $3000 annual registration fee to access SNOMED.",

Early in the history of CDC, veterinarians in the U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC Veterinary Public Health Division helped reduce zoonotic diseases, especially rabies and food-borne illnesses [11]. Today, 89 veterinarians serve throughout CDC in positions that address not only infectious diseases but also the entire spectrum of public health challenges: environmental health, chronic diseases, human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, injuries, immunizations, laboratory animal medicine, global health, migration and quarantine, health education, and bioterrorism. Veterinarians contribute as epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, policymakers, researchers, and surveillance experts and in environmental and disease prevention and control programs both domestically and globally. At CDC, 228 veterinarians have participated in the Epidemic Intelligence Service since 1951 [12]. Forty-one states now have State Veterinary Public Health officials. In 2005, almost 300 students and faculty attended the first veterinary student day at CDC; in April 2007, CDC will co-host an inaugural conference with the Association of Schools of Public Health and Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges. In addition, CDC has been recognized as a World Association for Animal Health Collaborating Center for Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses. The CDC publication, Emerging Infectious Diseases, has highlighted zoonotic diseases in nearly every issue to zoonotic diseases and has devoted an annual issue in each of the previous 2 years. The CDC has provided an important scientific forum for zoonotic disease research and programs both domestically and globally and should serve as a template for the NIH, as will be discussed later in this paper (Section 5.1), for moving these highly trained and broad-based medical skill set professionals from a more decentralized setting into a central institute at the NIH.",

Delivery of clinical preventive services such as immunizations, mammograms, and cholesterol screening has risen steadily over the past two decades (National Center for Health Statistics [15]). Roughly 90% of employers now include well-child visits, childhood immunizations, screening tests, and adult physical examinations among covered health benefits, compared to less than half that did so in 1988 [16].

Numbers are harder to come by for recent years, but given the spiraling costs of treatment since 1988 it is likely that this ratio has gone down considerably since then\u2014possibly grossly estimated to be closer to 1:99 today. In this environment, preventive services often compete with one another and with diagnostic- and treatment-oriented care for increasingly constrained resources [21]. While preventive services are often believed to save costs, delivery of most preventive services, with few exceptions (e.g. some immunizations), incurs net costs [22]. Evidence that US society clearly favors the cure (or treat) approach to disease over prevention can be shown in the following ways. First, though there is a shortage of preventive medicine specialists (public health, general preventive medicine, occupational medicine, and aerospace medicine physicians), in the US the number of residents in training in 2004 was less than 0.4% of all residents, not sufficient for replacement or to fill the expanding demand for the specialty\u2019s skills and talents [23], [70]. Second, preventive medicine residencies and subspecialties in human and veterinary medicine are generally found in only graduate medical education programs not financed by CMS or mainstream academic training programs. Third, we believe that our preventive acts are only statistical, whereas our curative acts are certain. This mistaken belief perhaps derives from our sense that we have more control over cure outcomes than prevention outcomes\u2014we think that we do cure, whereas we only facilitate prevention. This notion of doing vs. facilitating is an important one, because if we believe that our curative actions are more effective than our preventive ones then we will more likely act toward the more effective. The editor of the British Medical Journal, Fiona Godlee, expressed this well when she states, \u201cBecause it is acted on healthy people, preventive medicine needs even stronger supporting evidence on benefits and harms than therapeutic interventions\u201d [24].",

Identifying effective interventions were and are difficult in prevention, where prospective controlled trials are often difficult to conduct. These studies come from the field of epidemiology which has changed remarkably during its growth in the past quarter century. One of those changes has been a mixed blessing of ever-increasing specialization among its practitioners at the cost of the generalist. This phenomenon has shaped the field and a partial explanation for this trend is found in the decline in the availability of training funds not focused on specific and general disease areas. Without returning to the training of general conservation-medicine based epidemiologists, the needed trend associations and study designs that are needed to show the economic and public health returns related to preventative practices field will not be realized and in addition lose some of its ability to quickly respond to new and expected emerging public health challenges. Conflicting recommendations from different organizations, further exacerbated by the advocacy positions of some groups, leave many clinicians uncertain about what to do. Clinicians facing increasing time pressures in practice may question the value of some routine preventive interventions, as may employers and other payers struggling with accelerating health care costs. Although more prevention information is reaching the public, the messages conveyed are often inconsistent and increasingly colored by commercial self-interest. Clinicians may feel compelled to provide unproven or ineffective services because patients demand them or they fear being sued, but patients may find that insurance coverage for individual preventive services, especially new technologies, is inconsistent. The importance of clarifying what we know and do not know about the effectiveness of specific preventive services is as important in 2001 as it was in 1984. Although the USPSTF was disbanded in 1989 with the release of the Guide, the need to keep pace with the rapid growth in scientific evidence led to convening a second panel in 1990. The second USPSTF was smaller, with only 10 members, eight of whom were primary care physicians. It refined the previous group\u2019s methods for reviewing evidence and making recommendations, and expanded the scope of topics. It adopted policies for disclosure of conflicts arising from financial interests, funding sources, or other affiliations.",

The work of the second USPSTF culminated in the publication of the second edition of the Guide in 1996, which covered over 200 interventions in 70 areas. By the time the second edition of the Guide appeared, the environment for preventive medicine and evidence-based medicine had changed dramatically. Managed care organizations, which had emerged as a dominant paradigm for delivering and paying for health care, included some preventive care among basic covered services more commonly than had traditional fee-for-service insurance. At the same time, the heightened competition spurred by managed care brought increased attention to costs and value of treatments with less attention given to prevention. The Guide was frequently cited by health plans and systems of care in defending their health maintenance programs and benefits packages, and its recommendations informed many of the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures developed by the National Committee on Quality Assurance for evaluating health plan performance but not integrated into cost saving practices by the insurance companies.",

UNICEF funding for vaccination fell from $182 million to $51.4 million between 1990 and 1998 [25], [63]. Global coverage of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine has been at around 74% since 1990 [26]. Fifty-seven developing countries have yet to eliminate neonatal tetanus, and 200,000 babies died of the disease in 2000. Ten developing countries reported cases of polio in June 2005, despite the massive (and largely successful) global effort to eradicate the virus [27], [50], [51]. Sixty-two percent of countries, meanwhile, had still not achieved full routine immunization coverage in 2003, with GAVI estimating that at least 9.2 million additional infants need to be reached to achieve full coverage. There are several factors behind this loss of momentum. Although dramatic progress has been made in increasing worldwide vaccination coverage from below 5% to above 70%, the task has inevitably become harder now that the easiest-to-reach populations have been vaccinated. Because these communities are more elusive, the average cost per vaccination has increased, and it may be that other apparently cheaper health interventions have become more attractive.",

Only 16% of vaccine-importing countries could guarantee vaccine safety and quality [28], while a further study of 19 developing countries found that at least half of injections were unsafe [64], [73], [74], [75], [76]. The third factor behind the lack of progress in recent years is political. Political disruptions have affected coverage in some areas. In Somalia and Congo, for example, where vaccination rates have fallen rapidly in the past decade, war and social breakdown have impeded public health campaigns, despite \u201cvaccination days\u201d in Congo that temporarily halted fighting.

At this juncture, it may be more rational for an individual to refuse vaccination in order to avoid any risk of side effects. With the oral polio vaccine, for example, there is a one in a million chance of paralysis, and in societies where mass vaccination has eliminated the disease, the risk of paralysis is greater than that of catching polio itself. What had once been a public and private good is now a public good but a private risk. As more and more people choose to avoid this risk, of course, overall coverage rates decline, and the community is once again exposed to the threat of the disease. Public perceptions have been influenced by vaccine scares. Controversy and the attendant bad publicity about the safety of vaccines have been abetted by incidents such as the withdrawal of half the US supply of flu vaccines in 2004 due to contamination at the manufacturer [60]. In addition, alarms over the safety of vaccines such as that for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), which some believe to cause autism, have further fanned the anti-vaccine movement\u2019s flames [59]. In the US, disputes continue to rage about the scientific basis of such claims, but the preponderance of the evidence, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), says that the MMR vaccine is safe [30].

Similarly, an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in Botswana led to the destruction of more than 300,000 animals in the most seriously affected province, and the immediate closure of the export slaughterhouse, which employed 200 persons. Owing to the catalyst role of livestock raising in the rural economy as a whole, the costs of the indirect effects of these measures were later estimated to be seven times higher than the costs caused by direct losses [32].",

            "text": "In Vietnam, 60% of the poorest segment of the population, for which poultry farming accounts for 6\u20137% of household income, is particularly vulnerable to income losses caused by avian flu. The FAO and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) estimate that between one-third and one-half of the populations living in the most seriously affected areas of Southeast Asia depend on poultry farming for at least a part of their income [32], [35]. In France, the leading European poultry producer, it is estimated that farmers affected by the crisis lost 40% of their income in 3 months (between January and March 2006). The effects of the production losses are also linked to price variations, which are caused by supply and demand (im)balances. Depending on the market, prices can rise sharply (consumer product on the domestic market) or plummet (product banned for export but cleared for consumption on the domestic market, product deemed too dangerous for human consumption or perceived as such). In Brazil, where 30% of products are exported, the price of a day-old chick, an early indicator of a possible change in production, reportedly fell by 50%. And even in cases where the country is not infected, market uncertainties and the fall in prices prompted the largest producers to cut back production by 15% this year. Loss of access to, or the opportunity to access, regional and international markets generally have more significant economic implications than just production losses. In 1997/1998, the Rift Valley fever outbreaks in East Africa seriously affected pastoral economies in Somalia, with a decline of more than 75% in exports (which generate more than 90% of foreign exchange in \u201cSomali land\u201d), following an embargo declared by Saudi Arabia on all animal products from the Horn of Africa [32], [36].",

Loss of access to, or the opportunity to access, regional and international markets generally have more significant economic implications than just production losses. Uruguay is a good example of a country that gained access to a lucrative market after eradicating foot-and-mouth disease. Beef exports increased in volume by more than 100% and in value by 52% after the OIE declared Uruguay to be officially foot-and-mouth disease-free without vaccination in 1996. Access to the U.S. market (where prices are double those of the domestic market) provides Uruguay with additional revenue to the tune of US $20 million each year. A medium-term analysis showed that access to \u201cPacific Rim\u201d markets would generate additional revenue of US $90 million each year, and yet, before the disease was eradicated, Uruguay had been spending (only) US$8 million to US $9 million each year on vaccines to combat foot-and-mouth disease. In this case, control costs would account for less than 10% of the revenue generated by exports alone [32].",

It is well known that agriculture plays an important role in the generation of income and jobs in other sectors but the closeness of this interdependence became particularly obvious during recent epizootics. For pastoral societies, animal husbandry contributes directly and indirectly to food security and to nutrition as a source of quality proteins, vitamins and trace elements, traction, and commercially tradable products [68], [69]. Certain diseases could have significant repercussions on food supply and the nutrition of poor communities that do not have readily available substitute products, which could therefore lead to famine (rinderpest for example). Poultry meat is the primary animal protein in Africa (which has little to begin with) and the indispensable source of discretionary income for the survival of millions of small farmers. The high mortality rates as a result of avian flu, which is extremely pathogenic, and the sanitary slaughter of poultry would therefore have a negative impact on the food available to the entire population, as well as on rural revenue.",

In 1977/1978 a major Rift Valley fever epidemic in Egypt resulted in 200,000 human cases and 600 fatalities [32], [36]. Twenty years later, a new epidemic affected over 500,000 persons in East Africa, and 500 persons succumbed to the hemorrhagic form of the disease. But zoonoses also affected industrialized countries with high health standards as was the case with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis in Europe [65]. Food-borne diseases (over 200 have been classified) are a major source of acute gastroenteritis (which costs the Netherlands US $27 million per year) and the cause of major morbidity with fatalities among children in the Third World [32]. In the specific case of a pandemic, most of the economic loss is caused by the increase in morbidities and fatalities in the human population and its repercussions on the world economy. The most recent estimates suggest that the \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza in 1918 caused the death of 50 million persons, that is, 2.5% of the population at the time. The most obvious economic losses were the reduction in quantity and productivity of the workforce, and according to the experts, in the case of a pandemic could represent 10 times more than all the other losses combined [33]. Another category of economic impact is linked to individual strategies to avoid contamination\u2014or to survive possible contamination. The example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) clearly shows the sharp drop in demand in the services sector (tourism, public transport, retail trade, hospitality and food services) resulting from the combined efforts of individuals to avoid any close contact [37]. Based on the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome in South-East Asia, the World Bank thinks that an avian flu pandemic could result in a 2% loss of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and cost the world economy US $800 billion in the space of 1 year. The losses are difficult to calculate and would undoubtedly be much more significant in light of the extremely high mortality rates in developing countries which do not have good health care systems. The impact of animal diseases on the tourism and leisure sectors could also be quite significant. The negative effect of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom on these two sectors amounted to US $49 billion because of restrictions on access to rural areas and represented more than half of the total cost of the disease [32].",

This program, International Lookout for Infectious Animal Disease (ILIAD), was implemented in South Africa [38]. At the core of ILIAD is the need for a permanent and sustainable regional program of in situ surveillance designed to detect, monitor, treat, prevent and control infectious diseases with the goals of increasing livestock production in remote farming communities, protecting the health of wild species, building indigenous physical and professional resources, and introducing communications and epidemiology information technologies. Transmission of infectious diseases is rampant in remote communities in the sub-Saharan region, just as they once were in the United States and as they always are wherever poverty and farming co-exist. Diseases shared by wild, farmed and captive/bred animals, and by animals and humans, suppress food production, frustrate species preservation efforts and greatly affect public health. Detection, prevention and control of these diseases are an essential element in expanding trade, improving nutrition, exploiting ecotourism and ensuring food security.",

Loss of access to, or the opportunity to access, regional and international markets generally have more significant economic implications than just production losses.

This is the case of classic swine fever in Haiti where recurrent outbreaks reduced the usage rate by 10%, which for pig farmers meant a loss of revenue of US $2.7 million per year [31], [32], [33]. With major crisis, long-term impacts would make themselves felt, since the additional costs of financing prevention and control measures would lead to an equivalent reduction in savings and investments. For example, the analysis of the global impact of the avian flu crisis in Europe was complicated by outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Brazil, the largest global exporter of beef and poultry. It is therefore easy to imagine what the combination of these two events would mean in terms of the upward push of prices of all meats, similar to what occurred in 2004 with North American beef and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The European Union, a net importer of beef, especially from Brazil, would see an increase in the price of beef in its internal markets stemming from the embargo imposed on Brazilian beef because of the foot-and-mouth disease.",

In the late 1960s, the Surgeon General of the USA, William H.

Such halcyon days from the 1960s to the early 1980s are but a memory. By 1980, the numbers were down to 36 per 100,000. The \u201cHealth for All\u201d accord, signed in 1978, set a goal of the year 2000 for eliminating many international scourges. But amid all this optimism, the numbers started rising. In 1995, 63 people per 100,000 died and we know the rest of the story, \u2026 or do we? The grandiose optimism rested on two false assumptions; that microbes were biologically stationary targets, that for the most part human and other animal diseases were for the most part limited to those species and geographically sequestered. Scientists have witnessed an alarming mechanism of microbial adaptation and change, anything but stationary, microbes and the insects, rodents and other animals that transmit them are in a constant state of biological, ecological flux and evolution [52].",

Recent data in this field suggest that the oceans of the world contains approximately 10 (31) phage particles or virions (cf. 22 million metric tons), much of it turning over once per day and most likely be a regular source for current and future zoonotic and human infections. This vast mutation engine, even if one assumes a minimal mutation rate, generates the equivalent of hundreds of new complete human genomes per day. A 200-L sample of surface seawater was concentrated; \u223c2 \u00d7 10 (12) viral particles, the DNA once randomly sheared and cloned yielded 1,934 fragments for sequencing. Data analysis showed that most of the sequences were from previously unknown viruses. Approximately 3.5% of the total sequence samples overlapped, suggesting that the marine viral community was highly diverse. A unique mathematical analysis further suggested that approximately 10 (4) different new viral types may be present. It is obvious from this most recent description that complex and confounding zoonotic interactions can be expected to occur as ecosystems become concentrated and/or diluted during the upcoming environmental and ecological change. This will require a new breed of medical scientists that have foregone the days of super- and sub-specialization and are now grounded in both depth and broad general eco- and bio-medical systems training.",

The future requires the veterinary research community to encourage research funders to develop a long-term interagency strategy for veterinary research [53], [54], [57].

In 1966, Dr. Schwabe established the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine\u2014the first of its kind in the world at a vet school. The author of more than 200 publications, he promoted the concept of \u201cOne Medicine,\u201d which attempts to bring the fields of human and animal health care together. To this goal in June of 2007 The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) announced that in partnership with the American Medical Association (AMA) there was an adopted resolution calling for collaboration on a One Health Initiative. The two national, medical organizations will work collaboratively on areas of mutual medical interest, such as pandemic influenza, bioterrorism risks, biomedical research and will be charged with developing strategies to promote collaboration among the various health science associations, colleges, government agencies and industries.

Comparably The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released a report in 2006, projecting a shortfall of approximately 55,000 physicians in 2020 [56]. If current trends continue, the full time equivalent (FTE) physician supply is projected to grow to 866,400 by 2020, while demand for physicians will increase to 921,500 due to the growth and aging of the U.S. Population (Physician Workforce Policy Guidelines, 2005). The report projects shortages will be in greatest in non-primary care specialties. It has been over 30 years since the federal government has allocated funds to increase the number of veterinarians and physicians that graduate each year. To begin to alleviate this problem The Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act (S. 914/H.R. 2206), which is currently being considered by the United States House of Representatives and Senate would provide an average of $150 million per year for the next 10 years in the form of competitive grants to help increase the number of veterinarians entering public practice.

This poses unprecedented risks for human safety and will require a closer linking of the two agencies.

Veterinary and human epidemiologists study risk factors for disease in animal/human populations and develop strategies for health promotion and disease control [58]. Unfortunately these are done frequently in a vacuum when in fact the two are inter-related and contributing to the observed and at the time undiagnosed disease spectrum However, animal/human health problems cannot be resolved by consideration of biological and physical factors alone. The veterinary and human (someday to become one and the same) epidemiologist working with field problems soon recognizes the critical role played by people in animal/human health issues.

Implementing prevention on a national scale brings additional factors into the equation such as availability of resources, adequacy of veterinary services, and animal health infrastructure, among others.

In addition, millions of exotic animals, birds, and reptiles are kept as pets [42]. Although pets enrich the lives of humans, they also potentially can threaten public health. Veterinarians help educate the public about prevention of zoonoses; vaccinate large numbers of pets for zoonotic diseases, such as rabies and leptospirosis; and reduce the level of ecoparasites that can transmit human diseases and intestinal worms, such as roundworms and hookworms, which can cause serious health problems in humans. The 60,000 private-practice veterinarians in the United States form a valuable front line for detecting adverse health events, reducing zoonotic diseases, and delivering public health education. Because veterinarians work at the interface of human, animal, and environmental health, they are uniquely positioned to view this dynamic through the lens of public health impact. Significant changes in land use, expansion of large and intensified animal-production units, and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water sources have created new threats to the health of both animals and humans [43]. Because animals share human environment, food, and water, they are effective sentinels for environmental, human, and public health problems, including bioterrorism.",

Humans, animals, and animal products now move rapidly around the world, and pathogens are adapting, finding new niches, and jumping across species into new hosts. In 2005, approximately 21 billion food animals were produced to help feed a world population of 6.5 billion persons; the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that demand for animal protein will increase by 50% by 2020, especially in developing countries [46]. The lessons learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, monkeypox, and avian influenza are reminders of the need to view diseases globally; integrate animal and public health surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory systems; and create new strategic partnerships among animal, human, and public health professions [47], [48]. Veterinarians are essential to the detection and diagnosis of and response to these threats and are integral to first-line defense and surveillance for bioterrorism agents.",
