            "text": "Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically transformed HIV infection from a death sentence to a clinically manageable chronic disease. Strict adherence to ART effectively suppresses viraemia, halts progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), thwarts HIV acquisition when used as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, and prevents transmission1. However, limitations in medication access and adherence, together with emerging drug resistance, remain major obstacles to ending the epidemic with ART alone2. Moreover, the risks of disease progression and virus transmission rapidly re-emerge in the vast majority of individuals upon cessation of ART due to rebound from viral reservoirs that persist during treatment3, necessitating lifelong ART administration. These key limitations compel refocused efforts towards understanding the determinants of HIV immune control, and the failure of such control, in order to inform the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccine strategies.",

For perspective, a snapshot of HIV sequence diversity within a single individual is comparable to the global diversity of influenza virus over an entire year4. Perhaps unsurprisingly in light of such variation, vaccine strategies to date have failed to provide adequate protection from HIV infection5\u20137, and the path forwards to an effective neutralizing antibody-based vaccine remains uncertain. Considering the formidable challenges associated with a preventive vaccine, it is perhaps even more difficult to imagine immune-based elimination of HIV infection, which, in addition to combating viral diversity, would also need to eradicate persistent viral reservoirs. Indeed, the only two examples of apparent HIV reservoir clearance have been mediated not by immunological or pharmacological interventions but rather by HIV-resistant haematopoietic stem cell transplantation8,9.",

An extensive body of evidence indicates that this durable control is mediated not by antibodies but by effective HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Given documented cases of spontaneous viral control for decades, such untreated HIV controllers represent a viable model for an effective vaccine and durable immune-mediated HIV remission. In this Review, we synthesize evidence that supports a translatable CD8+ T cell-mediated mechanism of durable HIV control, highlighting preclinical evidence suggesting that vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8+ T cells are able to limit both the transmission and establishment of persistent viral reservoirs. Finally, we outline the remaining hurdles for T cell-based HIV prevention and cure strategies to complement and synergize with ongoing B cell vaccine approaches.",

Unlike many features assessed in comparative studies between HIV controllers and chronic progressors, genetic polymorphisms are not influenced by HIV infection. Initial studies in long-term non-progressors identified a dramatic enrichment in HLA-B*57 (ref.21), and subsequent genome-wide association studies encompassing over 6,000 infected individuals across multiple large international cohorts have confirmed that the major genetic polymorphisms modulating HIV control reside almost entirely within the HLA-B and HLA-C loci on chromosome six22\u201326. In particular, these studies identified strong associations between HIV control and polymorphic amino acids lining the HLA class I peptide-binding groove, which likely influence the viral peptides that are presented for CD8+ T cell recognition of virally infected cells22. Variation at these amino acid positions define specific class I HLA alleles that previous studies have repeatedly shown to be associated with increased likelihood of control (for example, HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*52 and HLA-B*14) and others with risk of progression (for example, HLA-B*07, HLA-B*08 and HLA-B*35).",

Thus, additional non-genetic factors must influence control in individuals without protective alleles and progression in individuals with protective alleles. The HLA associations indicate a critical role for CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity in spontaneous HIV control, an inference that is most strongly supported by CD8+ T cell depletion studies leading to loss of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) control in a non-human primate (NHP) model27\u201330.

Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) secretion by CD8+ T cells exposed to HIV antigens, a widely used metric for identifying antigen-specific responses, does not correlate with HIV control33\u201335. Additionally, the limitations of IFN\u03b3 assays are underscored by a study showing that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells that secrete IFN\u03b3 are rarely the same cells that kill infected target cells36. The ability of antigen-stimulated cells to secrete combinations of cytokines and effector molecules, termed polyfunctionality, is greater in controllers than progressors37\u201339. However, whether this enhanced functionality is a cause or consequence of lower viral load has been difficult to discern. Importantly, polyfunctionality is lowest in those with the lowest viral loads by ultrasensitive assays, the smallest viral reservoirs and the least culturable virus40,41.",

Thus, combined analysis of both ex vivo and expanded CD8+ T cell responses in the context of antigen exposure provides a more accurate perspective on which qualities of CD8+ T cells are associated with spontaneous viral control (Fig. 1). In comparison with progressors, CD8+ T cell responses in HIV controllers show an overall increased ability to maintain long-term memory and effector potential, with the ability to kill infected cells before progeny virions are produced49\u201351, providing a clear rationale for exploiting these features for treatment, prevention and cure.",

Computational modelling of HIV sequence diversity has revealed that Gag regions targeted by controller responses have a lower mutational tolerance than those targeted by progressors, implying a structural basis for the observed mutational constraints58\u201360. The importance of CD8+ T cell epitope specificity is further supported by application of network theory to HIV protein structure. Network analysis of crystallographic HIV protein structures using a novel algorithm to quantify the contribution of non-covalent amino acid side chain interactions to overall protein structure revealed that proliferative CD8+ T cell responses in HIV controllers, irrespective of expressed HLA alleles, preferentially target HIV epitopes containing amino acids derived from highly interconnected (\u2018networked\u2019) regions of viral protein structure61. Mutation of these highly networked amino acids was also highly disruptive to viral fitness, making them ideal targets for immune pressure. Consistent with this, robust CD8+ T cell targeting of highly networked epitopes in controllers was associated with fewer mutations, especially at HLA anchor and TCR contact sites61. Perhaps most importantly, elite controllers lacking protective HLA alleles were also found to target epitopes containing highly networked amino acids that are not commonly targeted, suggesting that what has been considered a genetic barrier to control can be overcome.",

Consistent with this, increased frequencies of functional CD8+ T cells have been observed in the rectal mucosa of HIV controllers76. HIV-infected follicular helper CD4+ T cells, which reside within B cell follicles in lymphoid tissue and direct humoral immune responses, constitute a significant fraction of the persistent viral reservoir during chronic infection77,78. Importantly, CD8+ T cells are largely excluded from B cell follicles, representing a significant obstacle to CD8+ T cell-mediated clearance of infected follicular helper T cell reservoirs79. Recent evidence demonstrates that a population of follicular CD8+ T cells that express the follicle-homing receptor CXCR5 can traffic to or reside in lymphoid tissues under certain circumstances80\u201382. Viral control is associated with a higher proportion and functionality of follicular CD8+ T cells83\u201386, but viral replication within follicles can persist even during elite control of HIV87,88, underscoring the need to develop strategies that promote the trafficking and function of HIV-specific follicular CD8+ T cells. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells represent an additional subset of CD8+ T cells that control viral infection in various tissue sites89. Relative to peripheral blood CD8+ T cells, follicular CD8+ T cells and TRM cells in lymphoid tissues have a lower expression of perforin and granzymes, potentially due to tissue-specific microenvironmental regulation of T cell function as a means to limit tissue inflammation and damage90,91. However, their precise functional profiles and roles in HIV control remain unclear. Suppression of viral replication by lymphoid CD8+ T cells from elite controllers has been observed in the absence of detectable cytolytic activity, suggesting that non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell functions may also be important for ongoing control of HIV in lymphoid tissues92. Although, as with peripheral blood responses, ex vivo function of HIV-specific follicular CD8+ T cells and TRM cells in lymphoid tissue must be carefully interpreted in the context of recent local antigen exposure, epitope specificity and viral escape from recognition. Additional studies aimed at understanding the precise role and mechanisms of action of HIV-specific follicular CD8+ T cells and TRM cells in spontaneous control will be crucial to the development of strategies that harness these cells for the cure and prevention of HIV infection.",

Consistent with this, a role for natural killer cells in modulating HIV control through modest reductions in viral load has been well established by a large body of literature, including robust genetic associations93\u201397. Viral factors have also been implicated in modulating HIV control; however, it is difficult to distinguish causal from consequential associations due to CD8+ T cell-associated mutations that impair viral replication capacity98. Although it is clear that fully replication-competent viruses can be isolated from controllers99, control has also been associated with viruses harbouring mutations that impair viral replication fitness100\u2013102. Studies of HIV transmission events between controllers and progressors demonstrate that viral properties are neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate spontaneous HIV control103,104. Nonetheless, many transmitted viruses are pre-adapted to immune responses in their prior hosts, which may impair fitness and/or blunt the ability of CD8+ T cells to achieve spontaneous control in recipients expressing the same HLA allele105,106.",

On the one hand, a small fraction (1.2% per year) of HIV controllers ultimately lose control, experiencing rebound viraemia and CD4+ T cell depletion10. Furthermore, some controllers experience significant immune activation in the absence of detectable viraemia due to persistent viral replication in tissue sites and expression of antigen from defective proviruses88,116\u2013118, which can be reduced by ART119. On the other hand, a subset of elite controllers is able to maintain a stable state of undetectable viraemia with no appreciable immune activation. Indeed, many elite controllers have extremely small replication-competent proviral reservoirs with low sequence diversity, suggesting functional reservoir suppression120\u2013123. In some elite controllers, viral reservoirs are suppressed so profoundly that replication-competent virus cannot be detected or recovered102,124. Such cases of exceptional control, albeit rare, represent a natural model for immune-mediated functional cure approaches with the goal of durable remission, providing optimism that immune-mediated eradication of infection may be possible. Further research is warranted to determine whether individuals with the best reservoir containment represent an extreme on a continuum of spontaneous HIV control mediated by a common mechanism or whether additional mechanistic features distinguish this subset from other HIV controllers.",

Moreover, there was an increased risk of HIV acquisition in males lacking circumcision and with pre-existing anti-Ad5 antibodies.

These immunogens largely give rise to CD8+ T cell responses specific for immunodominant viral epitopes that are similar to those targeted in natural infection, where the majority of individuals fail to control infection due to the emergence of viral variants that evade immune recognition. Consistent with this, viral sequence analysis from STEP trial participants revealed a \u2018sieving\u2019 effect, whereby vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses led to an enrichment of viral species with mutations at common HLA class I restricted T cell epitope sites140.

The reliance of many existing vaccine modalities on the induction of central memory CD8+ T cell responses has raised concern over whether immune recall will be sufficiently rapid to prevent the early phases of viral dissemination. Circumventing this issue are novel rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors that are able to elicit persistently active effector memory CD8+ T cell responses in rhesus macaques due to the constitutive expression of SIV Gag antigen and CMV-induced memory inflation152,153. Remarkably, in numerous studies, these vectors have been able to consistently protect ~50% of animals from viral challenge154\u2013157. Moreover, detailed evaluation at necropsy revealed that vaccinated animals lacked any detectable virus, indicating that continuous effector memory T cell responses were able to clear tissue-associated viral reservoirs and thus achieve sterilizing immunity155. This protection was also afforded by attenuated RhCMV, even when challenged 3 years post-vaccination156.",

Vaccination with a chimpanzee adenovirus vector (ChAdOx) prime and a modified vaccinia Ankara boost of tHIVConsv led to a clear shift in CD8+ T cell immunodominance patterns towards conserved segments170. These data provide optimism that augmentation of cellular antiviral immunity and redirection towards protective epitopes is possible via therapeutic vaccination with focused HIV immunogens.",

Higher order HIV sequence analysis of couplings between viral mutations within the conserved Gag protein using random matrix theory58 and quantitative fitness landscapes59 has revealed multidimensional constraints on viral evolution that predict regions of vulnerability. These mutationally intolerant amino acids are likely related to structural interdependencies that are important for viral fitness, and thus represent promising targets for CD8+ T cell pressure. Recent identification of structurally constrained epitopes restricted by common HLA alleles and strongly associated with spontaneous HIV control provides an additional avenue for re-directing CD8+ T cell responses, which may further increase the probability of inducing protective immunity61.",

However, eliciting each response will require different immunogens and optimization of distinct parameters, warranting separate but parallel development efforts171. In addition, the selection of vaccine immunogens, vectors and delivery routes will have important impacts on CD8+ T cell function, specificity and localization (Table 1). Optimal immunogen design may require an improved understanding of the effects of immunodominance and original antigenic sin on immunogenicity and protective efficacy. The selection of vectors and adjuvants to elicit the appropriate targeting of functional responses in the appropriate tissues against protective antigenic epitopes will require significant development and empirical testing, which should be derived by iterative, small-scale human immunogenicity studies before moving forwards to larger efficacy trials. The induction of CD4+ T cell help to assist the development of effective CD8+ T cell immunity will also be required, but activation of these CD4+ T cells will need to be carefully regulated given that this may cause increased susceptibility to HIV infection, diminished vaccine efficacy and more rapid disease progression147,172,173. The widespread availability and use of pre-exposure prophylactic ART poses unique challenges to the design of and recruitment for prophylactic vaccine efficacy trials, and the anticipated introduction of long-acting injectable ART may further complicate future studies174.",

            "text": "The development of therapeutic vaccines involves many unique challenges. Efficacy trials require monitored interruption of ART, including for individuals not receiving vaccination in controlled studies, which has raised important medical and ethical concerns175. Recent evidence that brief treatment interruption has no significant long-term impact on immune activation, drug resistance, reservoir size or composition indicates that such studies are safe176\u2013178. Another challenge is that preventive vaccines may be ineffective in a therapeutic setting. For example, therapeutic immunization with the same RhCMV vector that afforded substantial protection and early clearance of SIV infection in a prophylactic setting was ineffective in reducing the SIV reservoir after therapeutic immunization despite early initiation of ART179. Pre-existing immune escape and dysfunctional immune responses in chronically infected individuals represent added challenges for therapeutic immunization approaches as immunization may preferentially expand these responses. Nonetheless, much of the preliminary clinical testing for cellular immune HIV vaccines will likely occur in a therapeutic setting owing to practical considerations in evaluating efficacy and managing risk, and where shifts in CD8+ T cell immunodominance to specific regions of the viral proteome have been previously demonstrated165,170. The development of optimal adjuvants, immunomodulatory agents and latency-reversing agents for coadministration with immunogens will also be important for the success of therapeutic HIV vaccines180. Intriguingly, the infusion of two potent bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074) early during SHIV infection led to sustainable viral suppression that was lost upon subsequent delivery of a CD8\u03b2-depleting antibody, suggesting a possible vaccinal effect of these bNAbs that can improve the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cells181. Although NHP models have provided clear benefits for preclinical vaccine testing182, differences in viral diversity, duration of therapy, anti-vector immunity and pathogenesis may contribute towards the limited translation of efficacy from such models to humans.",

Mechanistic studies in spontaneous HIV controllers highlight the function, specificity and localization of CD8+ T cells as important determinants of protection, and the ability to uncouple protection from specific HLA alleles represents a key step towards broad clinical translation. Preclinical and clinical vaccine trials have provided additional insights towards the development of improved T cell-based prevention and cure modalities.
