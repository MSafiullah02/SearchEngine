However, due to significant risks and complications associated with VV ECMO, (5) this strategy should be reserved only for the most critically ill patients with refractory hypoxemia despite mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "The ideal monitoring strategy for right ventricular function in the setting of LVAD and COVID-19  has not yet been established. It is certainly plausible that infection with SARS-CoV-2 might further worsen right ventricular function, particularly in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. (2) It is reasonable to consider echocardiography and/or invasive hemodynamic assessment with pulmonary artery catheterization for any significant clinical change, such as hypotension or requirement of vasopressor/inotropic support, to rule out right ventricular failure.Alternatively, central venous access can be used to measure central venous pressure and venous oxygenation, as was done for our patient.Implementation of prone positioning has previously been shown to improve oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. (3) However, literature is limited regarding hemodynamic consequences, safety, and efficacy of this maneuver in LVAD patients.Furthermore, prone positioning presents additional challenges to staff caring for these patients due to limited access to driveline systems and potential need for urgent supination in case of LVAD alarms. Current literature in non-LVAD patients recommends using prone positioning in patients with ARDS and severe hypoxemia despite ventilation with high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) and positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, with an FiO 2 of \u22650.6 and a PEEP of \u22655 cm of water). (4) Given that our patient was effectively ventilated and oxygenated with conventional mechanical ventilation, and owing to unknown hemodynamic consequences and potential management challenges, implementation of prone positioning was felt to be too high risk for our patient. We agree with Dr. Imamura that prone positioning should be considered in certain LVAD patients with ARDS and severe hypoxemia despite high PEEP and FiO2, albeit given the limited data on the hemodynamic consequences of prone positioning in LVAD patients, close hemodynamic monitoring is recommended.",
