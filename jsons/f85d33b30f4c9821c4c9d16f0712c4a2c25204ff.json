            "text": "Zinc is required for multiple cellular tasks, and especially the immune system depends on a sufficient availability of this essential trace element. During the last decades, many studies attempted to affect the outcome of various diseases by zinc supplementation. These efforts either aimed at supporting immunity by zinc administration or at correcting a loss of zinc secondary to the disease to restore the zinc-dependent functions of the immune system. This review aims to summarize the respective findings and to discuss possible molecular mechanisms by which zinc could influence viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and the response to vaccination. Zinc supplementation in diseases such as diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, acute lower respiratory infection, and leishmaniasis seems beneficial. In contrast, the results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in most vaccination and rheumatoid arthritis studies. For AIDS and type 1 diabetes, zinc supplementation may even be a risk factor for increased mortality or deterioration of the glucose metabolism, respectively. In these cases, zinc supplementation should be used with care and limited to clearly zinc-deficient individuals.",

Among the immune cells that are affected by zinc deficiency, T lymphocytes seem to have the highest susceptibility [46] and are influenced on several levels ( Fig. 1) . Zinc deficiency reduces the number of peripheral and thymic T cells, their proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, and the functions of T helper (TH) and cytotoxic T cells, but also acts indirectly by reducing the levels of active serum thymulin. On the molecular level, zinc stimulates the autophosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase Lck by non-covalent interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of CD4 and CD8, leading to T cell activation [110, 137, 157] . As one result, the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is usually reduced in zinc-deficient individuals. However, other cells are also affected, leading to reduced antibody production and compromised function of cells of the innate immune system, such as natural killer cell activity, cytokine production by monocytes, and the chemotaxis and oxidative burst of neutrophil granulocytes [65, 129] .",

It has been shown that IL-6 induces the expression of the zinc trans-porter Zrt-and Irt-like protein (ZIP) 14, thereby increasing zinc uptake into hepatocytes [80] . IL-6 also upregulates the zinc binding protein metallothionein (MT) and increases cellular zinc in hepatocytes [143] . Experiments with MT knockout mice confirmed that during endotoxin-induced inflammation, MT is required for zinc sequestration in the liver, leading to a significant reduction in plasma zinc levels [113] . Hence, during the acute-phase response, hypozincemia is caused by ZIP-mediated translocation of zinc into the liver and sequestration bound to MT (Fig. 2) . Conversely, zinc affects several aspects of monocyte signal transduction and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells [58] , and zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in healthy human subjects [118] .",

These studies often gave highly contradictory results. Resolving these discrepancies is difficult. A major problem is the different amounts of elemental zinc that were administered, which sometimes differed by more than one order of magnitude. Matters are complicated even further by the fact that the metal content varies significantly between different zinc salts, and several zinc supplements even exist in different salt forms (Table 1) . If this form is not specified, the amount of elemental zinc that has been administered cannot be calculated reliably. Furthermore, even if the same supplement is used in various studies, the amount of calculated elemental zinc diverges between different research groups. Other studies do not report the zinc status of the patients, and zinc-deficient subjects will react differently to zinc treatment than zinc-sufficient ones. Even when data regarding the patients zinc status are provided, the parameters measured in most studies are total serum or plasma zinc. The significance of these values is questionable. While they are well suited to detect severe forms of zinc deficiency, they are not adequate parameters to indicate marginal zinc deficiency [2, 56] .",

Salts with organic anions such as acetate, methionine, or histidine generally have a higher bioavailability than zinc sulfate, while zinc oxide is of lower availability. Furthermore, zinc uptake does not only vary between different salt forms, but also depends on the source and manufacturing process of the supplements, particularly with regard to ZnO [35] (Table 2) . Inflammation and zinc homeostasis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce the production of ZIP14 and metallothionein (MT). This leads to enhanced zinc transport via ZIP14 into liver cells, where it is stored bound to MT. As a consequence of this zinc translocation from plasma into the liver, a significant decrease in plasma zinc occurs during inflammation. On the other hand, zinc affects pro-inflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (M). Hence plasma zinc levels can regulate cytokine secretion. Solid lines show a direct release or translocation of a substance, while dashed lines indicate a modulation of expression.",

            "text": "Concerning bioavailability, one has also to consider the nature of the diet consumed by the subjects. The uptake of zinc is more efficient with an intake of animal protein than with a dietary intake predominantly consisting of cereal protein. The absorption of zinc is negatively influenced by zinc-chelating phytates and phosphates as well as by augmented levels of other bivalent cations, such as Cu, Mg, Ca, Ni, Cd, and Fe. On the other hand, it is increased by high amounts of proteins and single amino acids, in particular histidine and methionine [82, 159] . In turn, high-dose zinc supplementation can also interfere with the uptake of other nutrients. This has been documented for iron [105] , and in particular for copper. Impaired copper uptake by excessive zinc supplementation induces severe copper deficiency, which can lead to anemia and neutropenia, abrogating the potential bene-ficial effects of zinc therapy [114, 120, 139] . Finally, gastric acidity enhances zinc absorption, especially for zinc oxide. This can be a particular problem for the elderly. They have a high incidence of hypo-or achlorhydria [61] and show a general tendency for lower zinc levels, which leads to an impairment of immune function [57, 131] .",

Table 3 specifies different zinc supplementation studies dealing with diseases induced by viral pathogens. The common cold is a syndrome caused by a multitude of different viruses, many of them belonging to the rhino-and coronaviruses. For this disease, the use of zinc has been extensively investigated. The individual studies will not be discussed in detail here because they have already been summarized and compared elsewhere [64, 66, 67] . In these studies, which used 4.5-23.7 mg elemental zinc per single dose, the results are as inconsistent as the treatment conditions. In a review by Hulisz [64] it was concluded that zinc can be effective in reducing the duration of the common cold when administered within 24 h after the onset of symptoms. A recent study in children indicates that zinc may also have a prophylactic effect and the administration of zinc results in a lower mean number of colds [78] . However, two metaanalyses did not confirm an effectiveness of zinc- -lozenges in reducing the symptoms of the common cold after seven days [66, 67] . Many potential mechanisms have been suggested that could explain a potential beneficial effect of zinc. These include effects of zinc on viral replication and infection of cells on the one hand and the immune system, in particular cytokine production and modulation of the activity of immune cells, on the other.",

It was hypothesized that the positively charged zinc ions can bind to the negatively charged regions at the carboxyl termini of rhinovirus coat proteins, thereby preventing the binding to ICAM-1 [64, 102] . In addition, zinc may protect or stabilize the cell membrane [107] , which could also contribute to an inhibition of the entry of the virus into the cell.

A reason for the former effect may be an action of zinc through thymulin on the maturation of T cells. Thymulin is a zinc-dependent nonapeptide hormone [26] that regulates the differentiation of immature T cells in the thymus [135] and the function of mature T cells in the periphery [24, 134] . On the other hand, an antiapoptotic action of zinc ions [155] at both the peripheral and thymic level could result in an increase in the number of TH cells. It is known that zinc inhibits caspases-3, -6, and -9 [92, 111, 150, 172] . Moreover, zinc can increase the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, thus enhancing the cells' resistance to apoptosis [47] .",

In addition, when Fawzi et al. [40] investigated the effects of zinc supplementation on pregnant HIV-positive women, zinc had no effect on pregnancy outcome, but the authors reported lower increases in hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and packed cell volume after the women had given birth. To make matters worse, two studies by Tang et al. [153, 154] indicated an increased risk for the progression to AIDS and a lower survival after zinc intake by HIV-positive individuals. One explanation for these contradictory results may be a different zinc status of the patients. While moderate zinc supplementation to zinc-deficient subjects can advance their immune responses, it may have harmful effects when given to zinc-sufficient ones. Zinc deficiency is frequent in patients with AIDS without treatment; however, anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to counteract the zinc deficiency [133] . Hence, zinc supplementation should be seen as a potential hazard to these patients and be strictly limited to individuals with documented zinc deficiency.",

Diarrhea is a target for successful zinc treatment. This has been extensively studied, and the results have already been summarized in detail, showing that zinc can reduce the duration, sever-ity, and incidence of diarrhea [41, 63] . Two pooled analyses were conducted by the Zinc Investigators' Collaborative Study Group assessing the use of zinc for the prevention or treatment of diarrhea in children in developing countries [14, 15] . The combined results of seven trials of continuous zinc supplementation confirmed that zinc significantly reduces the incidence and prevalence of diarrhea [14] . When zinc was used for the treatment of acute and persistent diarrhea, the probability of continuation was reduced and the rate of treatment failure or death was diminished by 42%. These results caused the authors to conclude a substantial benefit of zinc supplementation for the treatment of both acute and persistent diarrhea in children [15] . However, a recent report points out that this may not be the case for infants younger than six months of age [166] . Diarrhea leads to increased intestinal loss and malnutrition with micronutrients, including zinc. This loss can be corrected by oral zinc supplementation, which may improve the absorption of water and electrolytes by the intestine [52, 63, 108] , lead to a faster regeneration of the gut epithelium [12] , and increase the levels of enterocyte brush-border enzymes [49, 106] . Finally, the loss of zinc may negatively affect immune function, which can be antagonized by zinc supplementation to improve the clearance of bacterial pathogens from the intestine [146] .",

One study found a reduction in the required dose of clofazimine, a withdrawal of primarily essential steroids, and an improved toleration of dapsone after zinc treatment. Furthermore, they observed a reduced incidence and severity of erythema nodosum leprosum, a gradual decrease in the size of granuloma, and a gradual increase in the number of lymphocytes [89] . Another study reported a decreased incidence of erythema, edema, and infiltration as well as a reduced bacterial index of granuloma. In addition, there was a regrowth of eyebrows and an increase in neovascularization and endothelial cell proliferation [90] . Those beneficial effects of zinc treatment were confirmed by two other studies [36, 84] , which detected decreased size of skin nodules, improved delayed hypersensitivity reactions, a disappearance of erythema and a regrowth of eyebrows [36] as well as improvements regarding frequency, duration, and severity of erythema nodosum leprosum reactions, and a reduction in steroid requirements [84] .",

Lower respiratory infection may be caused by different bacterial or viral pathogens, the nature of which was not investigated in these studies. Hence it can be concluded that zinc treatment reduces the symptoms, but an effect of zinc on the immune response against the underlying pathogens cannot be concluded from these data. A pooled analysis of four trials in which continuous supplementation was investigated confirmed that zinc is efficient for the prevention of pneumonia. Here, zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia in children in developing countries by 41% [14] . Pneumonia is a major factor of childhood mortality; it accounts for approximately 20% of childhood deaths in developing countries [175] , making zinc supplementation a promising approach for a significant reduction in childhood mortality. In addition, a recent study indicates that zinc may also be helpful for the elderly. Serum zinc concentrations were negatively associated with the incidence of pneumonia in nursing home residents, indicating that zinc supplementation may be a measure to prevent pneumonia in the elderly [93] .",

A way in which zinc deficiency could affect the pathogenesis of RA is its influence on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In patients with RA, the serum zinc level correlates negatively with levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 as well as parameters for inflammation such as acute-phase proteins and erythrocyte sedimentation. This corresponds to a cellular in vitro model for zinc deficiency in which the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 were increased [8] , and to other observations demonstrating that monocytic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is inhibited by zinc ions [164, 165] . IDDM is typically accompanied by a loss of zinc due to increased urinary excretion, resulting in a decrease in total body zinc. This secondary zinc deficiency might contribute to diabetic complications [21] . On the one hand, zinc is necessary for insulin maturation and storage as a solid hexamer bound with two zinc ions per hexamer in insulin secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cells [30, 37, 53] . On the other hand, zinc deficiency comprises the potential to hinder immune function, interacting with pro-inflammatory cytokine production as discussed above. Both effects suggest a potential benefit for zinc as a supporting therapeutic intervention in diabetic patients.",

Zinc deficiency is known to induce oxidative stress [18] , and in both diseases, reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis [1, 104] . The influence of zinc on redox metabolism is well established [87, 115] and several mechanisms have been suggested by which zinc can act as an antioxidant. Because zinc itself is not redox active in biological systems, its antioxidant function is indirect, for example through the expression of MT [59, 87] . Moreover, zinc can bind to thiolate groups and protect them from oxidation by lowering their susceptibility to oxidation [87] . Other trace metals can also play a role in RA. Excess iron aggravates inflamma-tion [1] and zinc has been shown to counteract transition metal-mediated oxidation by interfering with the Haber Weiss cycle [18] . Finally, zinc is important for antioxidant enzymes. It was suggested that zinc may exert an effect on lipid peroxidation by protecting the active site of the selenium-glutathione peroxidase, which is important for detoxification of reactive oxygen species, against the binding of toxic ligands with subsequent inactivation of the enzyme [39] . In addition, the zinccontaining metalloenzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the degradation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, is effective against IDDM [76] and RA [1] in vivo.",

Although this has not been directly investigated so far, the improvement in parameters for oxidative stress in diabetic patients indicates that the antioxidant effect of zinc is relevant for disease progression in vivo. One study found a positive effect on oxidative stress, measured by an increase in selenium-glutathione peroxidase activity, and a decrease in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, which are an indicator for lipid peroxidation [39] . On the other hand, two other studies detected an increase in the glycosylated form of hemoglobin, HbA1c, indicating a further deterioration of metabolic control [25, 29] . Taken together, it seems that zinc supplementation can be helpful against oxidative stress, but its effect on glucose metabolism may limit its usefulness in diabetic patients. ",

In this report, a correlation between failure to respond to diphtheria vaccination by elderly chronic hemodialysis patients and low serum zinc level was found [75] .

Following this treatment the patients showed an increase in the anti-tetanus toxin IgG titer and also in the number of circulating T lymphocytes and an improved delayed type hypersensitivity reaction toward several different antigens [32] . Potentially, zinc is required to restore normal TH cell function, but because it has a direct inhibitory effect on T lymphocytes [171] , supplementation during vaccination may hinder efficient vaccination response.

The results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in many vaccination trials as well as most RA studies. It is unclear if this can be overcome by changes in dosage or duration.

Here the standard parameter, i.e. total serum or plasma zinc, does not adequately reflect the patient's zinc status, but the development of new methods such as the use of fluorescent probes for the measurement of labile intracellular zinc [56] may lead to improvement. Secondly, elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which zinc acts will help to provide a successful treatment, in particular when zinc is given in combination with other substances. Here an important first step will be evaluating which in vitro observations are relevant. Given that many effects can only be seen when supra-physiological concentrations of zinc are used, as in the different cases of the inhibition of viral replication, the likelihood for an in vivo relevance is questionable.

This leads to enhanced zinc transport via ZIP14 into liver cells, where it is stored bound to MT. As a consequence of this zinc translocation from plasma into the liver, a significant decrease in plasma zinc occurs during inflammation. On the other hand, zinc affects pro-inflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (M). Hence plasma zinc levels can regulate cytokine secretion. Solid lines show a direct release or translocation of a substance, while dashed lines indicate a modulation of expression.",
