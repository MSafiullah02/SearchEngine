            "text": "In clinical trials, it is often of interest to compare and order several candidate regimens based on multiple endpoints. For example, in HIV vaccine development, immune response profiles induced by vaccination are key for selecting vaccine regimens to advance to efficacy evaluation. Motivated by the need to rank and choose a few vaccine regimens based on their immunogenicity in phase I trials, Huang et al. (Biostatistics 18(2):230-243, 2017) proposed a ranking/filtering/selection algorithm that down-selects vaccine regimens to satisfy the superiority and non-redundancy criteria, based on multiple immune response endpoints. In practice, many candidate immune response endpoints can be correlated with each other. An important question that remains to be addressed is how to choose a parsimonious set of the available immune response endpoints to effectively compare regimens. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to be used in regimen down-selection, based on importance weights assigned to individual endpoints and their correlation structure. We show through extensive simulation studies that pre-selection of endpoints can substantially improve performance of the subsequent regimen down-selection process. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using a real example in HIV vaccine research, although the methods are also applicable in general to clinical research for dimension reduction when comparing regimens based on multiple candidate endpoints.",

            "text": "When developing a vaccine against a rare disease such as HIV/AIDS, efficacy trials are typically large and operationally challenging to conduct, making it critical to select and rank candidate vaccine regimens based on their immunogenicity in phase I studies before the regimens can be advanced to efficacy evaluation. We and others in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) have been developing statistical approaches and frameworks for this process. For example, out of 15 vaccine regimens studied in Phase I trials by the HVTN, combining 5 unique prime-boost types and 3 Env dose \u00d7 adjuvant types, Huang et al. [13] described statistical approaches for selecting up to 3 regimens to advance for concurrent testing in a later, multiregimen HIV vaccine efficacy trial. For maximum operational efficiency, it is desirable to have a strong statistical framework for selecting the most promising regimens in such a process, as the maximum number of regimens allowed to be selected is typically pre-determined based on the budget limit. The design of one such multiregimen phase IIb HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Southern Africa was laid out by Gilbert et al. [8] , to evaluate one or more qualifying prime-boost vaccine regimens for efficacy against a shared placebo arm. In phase I trials designed to inform downselection of vaccine regimens, the immunogenicity of a given vaccine (as characterized by multiple immune response endpoints such as T-cell or antibody responses) is an essential criterion in regimen selection. Moreover, vaccine-induced multivariate immune response biomarkers play a key role in vaccine development as potential correlates of a vaccine's protective effect in preventing HIV infection; that is, a vaccine's efficacy can be predicted based on the magnitude and breadth of the immune responses elicited by the vaccine [6, 7] .",

            "text": "Huang et al. [14] investigated the problem of how to rank and down-select a small number of vaccine regimens based on a given set of immune response endpoints. While others have also studied this type of \"pick-the-winner\" problem, previous work typically focused either on the selection of a single best regimen based on a few endpoints [19] [20] [21] or on the comparison of two regimens with respect to univariate or multivariate endpoints [1, 2, 4, 16, 18, 22, 23] . The particular problem of selecting the best several regimens based on multivariate endpoints has unique challenges. Huang et al. [14] addressed this down-selection problem through the development of formal superiority and non-redundancy criteria for selecting regimens. The formal superiority criterion states that regimens with superior immunogenicity are preferred. The non-redundancy criterion states that when more than one regimen can be advanced, it is desirable to advance regimens with diverse immune profiles such that different vaccines (acting via potentially different mechanisms) for HIV prevention can be evaluated in the efficacy trial. A rank/filtering/selection (RFS) algorithm based on ranking and hypothesis testing was developed [14] to select regimens satisfying these two criteria, where a pre-determined set of immune response endpoints was used for comparison between regimens. Multi-test adjustment was proposed to account for the multiple pairs of regimens for comparison and the multivariate endpoints considered in order to control the probability of selecting regimens with redundant immune profiles into the final set.",

These immune response endpoints can involve different immune classes, such as cellular or humoral responses, as well as different antigens. Moreover, these immune response endpoints can be correlated with each other and differ in their strength as predictors of a vaccine's protective effect. Entering all possible immune response endpoints into the down-selection algorithm would create an unnecessary measurement burden and also have a negative impact on the down-selection process. A numeric example in Huang et al. [14] shows that when multivariate immune response endpoints are highly correlated with each other, the multi-test adjustment implemented in the RFS algorithm can be too conservative and have reduced power to detect differences between regimens. How to choose a parsimonious subset of immune response endpoints from a larger number of candidate endpoints to enter into down-selection is an important open question that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. We investigate and propose algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to enter into down-selection, taking into account information about the importance of individual endpoints as correlates of a vaccine's protective effect as well as the correlation structure among these endpoints. While this research is motivated by the down-selection problem in the HIV vaccine trial setting, it also has more general applications for feature selection when a large number of candidate endpoints are available for comparison between intervention groups.",

In practice, it is possible for some immune response measures to have a \"harmful\" effect, in the sense that a higher immune response is associated with lower vaccine efficacy. In such a situation, one can use the negative value of the original immune response measurement as the endpoint of interest in the framework we will describe next. Suppose the comparison between regimens with respect to individual endpoints is based on mean values. That is, a regimen A is considered superior, inferior, or equivalent to another regimen B with respect to a particular endpoint i if the mean of the endpoint in A is larger ( Ai > Bi ), smaller ( Ai < Bi ), or the same ( Ai = Bi ) compared to that in B. A regimen A is defined to be superior to regimen B (or equivalently B inferior to A) with respect to their immune profiles if A is superior to B with respect to at least one endpoint and is not inferior to B with respect to any endpoint. Two regimens A and B are said to have equivalent immune profiles if they are equivalent with respect to each endpoint considered. When a set of vaccine regimens is selected, the superiority criterion [13] is fully satisfied if no selected regimen is inferior to any other regimen that enters down-selection. The non-redundancy criterion [14] argues that with limited resources for conducting the efficacy trial, it is desirable to select vaccine regimens with diverse immune profiles, so that diverse potential mechanisms that mediate a vaccine's protective effects can be investigated in the efficacy trial. A vaccine regimen A is defined to be non-redundant to regimen B if A is not superior, not inferior, and not equivalent to B with respect to its immune profile. Non-redundancy is satisfied for a set of selected regimens if it is satisfied for any regimen pair in the set. An example illustrating the two criteria is presented in Web Supplementary Fig. 1 .",

In RFS, all regimens are first ranked according to a univariate summary score across individual endpoints (such as the weighted mean \u2211 p i=1 w i ij ), with a pre-determined positive weight w i for each individual endpoint reflecting its importance or usefulness in predicting vaccine efficacy. The top-ranked regimen is selected first, after which the rest of the regimens are evaluated sequentially according to their rank. In each step, a new regimen is compared with each regimen in the set selected earlier. Through hypothesis testing, if relative to any regimen already selected, one fails to declare that the new regimen is superior or non-redundant, the new regimen will not be selected into the set; otherwise, the new regimen is selected and all regimens selected earlier that fail to show non-redundancy to the newly selected regimen will be filtered out. This process is repeated until Q regimens have been selected or until all regimens have been evaluated once. As HIV vaccine efficacy trials are large and operationally challenging, satisfaction of the non-redundancy criterion is of paramount importance to avoid wasting valuable resources by advancing redundant regimens to efficacy evaluation. The RFS algorithm controls the probability of selecting non-redundant regimens into the final set through Bonferroni correction and uses the Holm procedure [10] to account for the comparison between multiple regimen pairs and the testing of multiple immune response endpoints. Details of the RFS algorithms are included in Web Supplementary Appendix A.",

However, as also demonstrated in Huang et al. [14] , the presence of highly correlated immune response endpoints can decrease performance of the down-selection process. In particular, the multitest adjustment to declare a significant difference between regimens can be too conservative when the endpoints are highly correlated, leading to sub-optimal power for detecting a difference between the regimens. Moreover, in vaccine immunogenicity studies, many candidate immune response endpoints are typically available; some of them might be useful surrogate endpoints for predicting a vaccine's protective effect (albeit with inherent measurement error), whereas others might have limited or no utility as surrogate endpoints, as they are not actually related to differential vaccine efficacy across regimens. Importantly, including all available candidate endpoints could potentially reduce performance of the down-selection process and lead to unnecessarily high measurement cost in phase I down-selection trials.",

One way to choose a set of useful and not highly correlated endpoints is to consider the importance of adding immune response endpoints as a gain and the correlation among immune response endpoints as a cost. We propose to write a reward function as In (1), S is a subset of chosen immune response endpoints; S = {w i \u2236 i \u2208 S} (with w i > 0 ) and S are the vector of importance scores and the correlation matrix of immune response endpoints in subset S; g(.) and c(.) are the gain and the cost functions corresponding to adding more immune response endpoints. Note that both g( S ) and c( S ) are increasing functions of |S|, i.e., the cardinality of set S. Thus, there should be an optimum subset of immune response endpoints that maximizes the reward function in (1) as For general functions g(.) and c(.), we need to search all possible subsets of immune response endpoints S. For instance, with p as the number of immune response endpoints, we need to search for all 2 p \u2212 1 (empty set is excluded) possible subsets. It is thus desirable to choose g(.) and c(.) such as to minimize the number of searches. We propose a simple and efficient way of defining g(.) and c(.) as additive functions of S and S as where controls the cost due to correlation among the chosen immune response endpoints in set S, and needs to be chosen carefully. If we choose a very small , we allow highly correlated immune response endpoints to enter the RFS algorithm, which can result in a more conservative decision regarding the comparison between regimens. If we choose a very large , we might discard some important immune response endpoints, which can result in sub-optimal performance for selecting the desired regimens. Here, we use a simple approach to alleviate this issue by normalizing the importance vector as, Now we can find S * as where b is a new tuning parameter establishing a trade-off between reward and penalty of adding more immune response endpoints; we use constraint i < i \u2032 to choose each correlation coefficient only one time (note that the correlation matrix is symmetric).

Details can be found in Web Supplementary Appendix B. Modeling disease risk conditional on potential immune responses if receiving a particular vaccine regimen (instead of actual observed immune responses in a trial participant) is appealing for HIV vaccine down-selection for the following reasons: (1) HIV vaccine trials typically enroll healthy individuals who have not been previously exposed to HIV vaccine antigens and thus their HIV-specific immune responses if receiving placebo would be zero; (2) modeling disease risk conditional on potential vaccine-induced immune responses allows prediction and ranking of vaccine efficacy based on immunogenicity induced by candidate vaccine regimens observed in phase I/II studies. In particular, let T be the treatment indicator with T = 0 indicating placebo receipt, and T = j for j = 1, \u2026 , m indicating receiving the jth regimen out of m different vaccine regimens.

We investigate the performance of our feature selection algorithms (penalization-based & BIC-based) combined with the RFS, and compare their performance with that of the naive RFS using the whole sets of immune response endpoints. We define regimens that should be selected as those that satisfy both the superiority and non-redundancy criteria, as well as those that should be ranked among the top Q; the remaining regimens should not be selected. Without loss of generality, here we evaluate settings where there are no other regimens in the whole set that have identical immune response profiles as the top Q regimens that should be selected. With a maximum allowable Q = 3 , we compare various approaches with respect to the following performance criteria: (i) the average total number of regimens selected, (ii) the percentage of regimens that should be selected among the selected set, namely the 'positive predictive value' (PPV), (iii) the probability that a regimen that should be selected is actually selected, i.e. the 'true positive rate' (TPR), and (iv) the probability that a regimen that should not be selected is mistakenly selected, i.e. the 'false positive rate' (FPR).

Within each cluster, the 15 measured immune response endpoints are equal to the underlying true immune response endpoints plus some measurement error, such that they have the same mean as the true underlying endpoints. In particular, the immune response endpoints within the first cluster of regimen 1 are empirically measured versions (i.e., with inherent measurement error and different noise levels) of the first true underlying immune response endpoint with mean and variance 1, while the immune response endpoints within the second cluster of the regimen 1 are empirically measured versions of the second underlying endpoint with zeromean and unit-variance. We have an opposite data generation mechanism for regimen 2. For regimen 3, we assume both true points have mean \u22152 and variance 1 and all immune response endpoints measured are empirically measured versions of the underlying true endpoints. Based on the means of the 30 immune response endpoints measured with error, regimens 1, 2, and 3 are non-redundant to each other and superior to the other regimens, and are thus the desired regimens to be selected. The first three immune response endpoints in each cluster have smaller measurement error (with measurement error standard deviation = 0.1) than the rest of the 12 immune response endpoints (with measurement error standard deviation = 1).

In the RV144 trial, 16,395 participants were recruited and randomized (1:1) to vaccine or placebo; of these, 8, 197 participants were assigned to receive vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Among the vaccine recipients who were uninfected at week 26, immune responses were measured from 41 cases (i.e. infected before month 42) and 205 controls (i.e. free of infection over 42 months) selected in a 5:1 ratio to cases among strata defined by gender, number of vaccine injections received, and per-protocol status [9] . Immune response endpoints measured at week 26 for the 205 uninfected vacinees were included in this data example (RV144T). Also included are data from four other regimens in a recently completed HVTN phase I trial (HVTN 096): NYVAC prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T1), NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T2), DNA prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T3), and DNA + AIDSVAX B/E prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T4). Participants in each of the four vaccine arms of HVTN 096 received vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24; immune response data measured from 19, 18, 17, and 19 vaccine recipients in T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively, are included in this data example. Eight immune response endpoints from each regimen are included in the analysis dataset: one neutralizing antibody (NAb) response endpoint measured using the TZM-bl assay, one CD4+ T-cell response endpoint measured using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and six IgG binding antibody response endpoints measured using the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) with different HIV antigens, including AE.A244 V1V2 Tags/293F (B1), gp70_B.CaseA2 V1V2/169K (B2), gp70_B.CaseA_V1_V2(B3), A244 gp120 gDneg/293F/mon (B4), vaccine insert (B5) and Con S gp140 CFI(B6). Figure 6 shows a heatmap of the correlations between the eight immune response endpoints along with their hierarchical clustering based on the correlation matrix.

The down-selection process ranked the vaccine regimens in the following order: 096T3, 096T1, 096T4, 096T2, and RV144T; 096T3 was selected as the only superior vaccine regimen. We then applied the proposed feature selection algorithms to the candidate immune response endpoints before entering the regimen down-selection. Two different sets of weights for individual immune response endpoints were considered. In the first set, equal weights were assigned to each endpoint. Based on this weighting strategy, the penalization-based algorithm chose three endpoints: ICS, B1, and NAb. Since all endpoints have the same importance wights, we chose ICS first because it has the lowest correlation with the other endpoints. We next chose B1 since it has the lowest correlation with Fig. 6 Heatmap of spearman correlations between different immune response endpoints in the data example ICS. NAb was the third endpoint chosen because it has low correlations with ICS and B1. The other five endpoints B2 -B6 were discarded because of their relatively high correlations with B1. Based on the three selected endpoints, the RFS algorithm ranked the vaccine regimens in the order of 096T3, 096T4, 096T1, RV144T, and 096T2; 096T3 was the only vaccine regimen selected. Therefore, with only 37.5% of immune response endpoints, the vaccine regimen selected is the same as when we used all immune response endpoints for down-selection. The BIC-based feature selection algorithm assigned B2 and B3 in the same clusters and assigned the remaining six endpoints into six individual clusters. It selected seven (B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, ICS, and NAb) out of eight endpoints. Based on these selected endpoints, the RFS algorithm ranked the vaccine regimens in the order of 096T3, 096T1, 096T4, 096T2, and RV144T. Again, 096T3 was the only regimen selected, this time with 87.5% of the immune response endpoints.",

[9] . Note that if one assumes the infection risk among placebo receipts does not depend on the vaccine-induced immune response, then this log(OR) among vaccine recipients is the same as the interaction coefficient 3 presented in (11) . Based on this weighting strategy, the penalization-based algorithm chose two immune response endpoints, B2 and B6. In particular, among endpoints B1-B6 that have high importance weights, B2 has the lowest correlation with other endpoints and was chosen first. After that, B6 was chosen because of its low correlation with B2. Other endpoints were discarded by the algorithm due to either high correlations with B2 and B6 or low importance weights. Based on the two selected endpoints (25% out of eight), the RFS algorithm ranked the vaccine regimens in the order of 096T3, 096T1, 096T4, 096T2 and RV144T; 096T3 was the only vaccine regimen selected. The BIC-based feature selection algorithm under the second set of weights selected the same seven endpoints as the equal weights setting; again, 096T3 was the only regimen selected.",

Identifying a parsimonious set of immune response endpoints most relevant for a vaccine's protective effect is essential in this down-selection practice, because the identification of such a set can lead to better down-selection performance and also significant resource savings in terms of lab assay measurements. Moreover, the resulting reduction in the number of immune response endpoints entering regimen down-selection can reduce the computational complexity in down-selection, which increases exponentially as the number of endpoints increases.",

            "text": "A caveat of the proposed feature selection algorithms is the need to input a relative importance weight of an individual immune response endpoint with respect to its relevance to the vaccine's protective effect. This weight is important for selecting desired endpoints. Consider a situation in which we have two assays, both measuring the same underlying true response, but with different levels of noise. The endpoint with smaller measurement error would have larger importance weight (or larger interaction with treatment estimated from pilot data). The endpoint with larger measurement error would have smaller importance weight. As a result, immune endpoints with smaller signal-noise ratios are more likely to be excluded in the penalized-based feature selection process, due to their smaller importance weights. In practice, one can also consider first screening out assays with low signal-noise ratios. Usually the relative importance weight can be estimated by eliciting expert input (e.g. regarding whether an assay is more tied to the mechanism of protection of a given vaccine) or can be substituted with the interaction between a vaccineinduced immune response endpoint and vaccine status in infection risk, estimated based on existing data. When weights are estimated with pilot data, the uncertainty associated with the estimated weights would affect the performance of feature selection. Therefore, during the process of HIV vaccine development, it is important for researchers to continue updating the importance weights as new data become available, in order to reduce the uncertainty in weight estimation. Meanwhile, since the choice of importance weights depends on untestable assumptions about the risk prediction model conditional on new vaccine regimens and vaccine-induced immune responses, it is important to perform sensitivity analysis in practice to evaluate the robustness of feature selection and regimen down-selection under a range of plausible importance weights. thank the participants, investigators, and sponsors of the HVTN 096 trial and the RV144 trial.
