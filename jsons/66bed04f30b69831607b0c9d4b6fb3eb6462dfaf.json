            "text": "The effects of regionalism on trade have been extensively evaluated within a gravity model framework. With the expected exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), the prospect of regional disintegration has brought about a new impetus to studying trade policy effects. Using actual and forecast data for a panel of bilateral imports between the EU15 and the rest of the world, this paper examines the trade effects of EU economic integration agreements (EIAs), their evolution over time and the related counterfactual Brexit trade policy scenarios. Distinct trade effects are obtained for the EU trade related agreements; positive, significant and of similar magnitude for the EU and free trade agreement (FTA) coefficients, but negative and significant (and smaller in magnitude) for the regional economic partnership agreements (EPAs). The subperiod results suggest the positive coefficients of EU and FTA membership tend to diminish over time, implying earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits. Finally, in generating the predicted values for the trade effects of three alternative counterfactual Brexit scenarios (hard Brexit, hard Brexit plus, global Britain), the findings suggest an asymmetric effect depending on the perspective of the UK versus the EU. Whereas the UK's trade would decline substantially with all three country groups (the EU, the FTAs and regional EPAs) and rise substantially with the rest of the world, only minor percentage changes are predicted for EU bilateral trade.",

Studies of the trade effects of economic integration agreements (EIAs) most commonly include regional integration in Europe, mainly because the European Union (EU) represents the deepest and most durable RTA worldwide and its succession of enlargements provides the basis for continual study (Greenaway and Milner 2002) .",

            "text": "Most studies of regional integration in Europe find a small, positive and significant effect of RTAs on trade although a neutral or even a negative effect also feature among the empirical findings. Using the gravity model framework, early studies tend to use cross sectional methods or a series of cross sections to assess the importance of regional integration whereas panel methods dominate more recent studies. Aitken (1973) , for example, estimate the gravity model as a cross section for each year over the period [1951] [1952] [1953] [1954] [1955] [1956] [1957] [1958] [1959] [1960] [1961] [1962] [1963] [1964] [1965] [1966] [1967] ; the trade effects for the dummy variables denoting the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are found to be consistent with theoretical predictions. In other words, the trade preference coefficients are initially negative and insignificant in the preintegration period, change sign during the integration phase and increase in magnitude with the progression of time, eventually becoming positive and significant. Continuing with the theme of estimating the trade effects of the EEC and EFTA dummies among the industrialised countries, Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1998) analyse successive cross sections for the later period, 1956-1992, to identify differences over time in the trade creating and trade diverting effects of European regionalism. The effect of European regional integration has also been examined across a range of panel estimators (Bussi\u00e8re et al. 2005; Stack 2009 ) while Cheng and Wall (2005) extend the sample size to consider the trade effects of additional regional blocks.",

            "text": "The trend of EU enlargement, however, is set to reverse with the contraction of EU membership to 27 countries as a consequence of the June 2016 referendum to withdraw the UK from the EU. 1 Not surprisingly, the unprecedented withdrawal of a large country from the world's largest trading block has prompted much empirical interest. 2 Much of the existing literature on estimating the trade consequences of Britain's exit from the EU (i.e. Brexit) relies on the World Input Output Database (WIOD), see, for example, Van Reenen (2016); Brakman et al. (2018) ; Dhingra et al. (2017) ; Felbermayr et al. (2018) . In effect, the data facilitate a quantitative trade model of the global economy, allowing for the channels through which trade affects consumers, firms and workers, thereby providing a map from trade to welfare analysis (Van Reenen 2016) . 3 In other strands of the literature, Kee and Nicita (2017) construct an overall trade restrictiveness index of the UK's major trading partners to analyse the short term effects of Brexit on goods trade. For a selection of EU and non EU trading partner countries, Douch et al. (2018) use a synthetic control method to analyse the effects of Brexit on UK bilateral trade. Various post Brexit trade policy scenarios have also been quantified using bilateral trade data that is inherent to the gravity model framework (HM Treasury 2016; Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr 2018) . 4 For a comprehensive panel dataset of bilateral imports between the 15 established member countries of the EU and the rest of the world, this paper examines the trade effects of EU economic integration agreements (EIAs), their evolution over time and the related counterfactual trade policy scenarios arising post Brexit.",

First, in contrast to the existing literature that tend to use a smaller sample of countries and hence a more limited number of EU trade related agreements, the trade effects for the full listing of EU EIAs are estimated. Specifically, EU EIAs comprise membership of the EU, an economic and political partnership between 28 countries; various trade related agreements including customs unions, free trade agreements (FTAs), association agreements and stabilisation agreements with 38 countries; and the more recently formed (and ongoing negotiation of) trade and development economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with 28 countries (see the Appendix Table 6 for the full list of EU EIAs). 5 Second, on the assumption that export growth projections for the trading partner countries apply equally across all the EU15 countries, forecast values are calculated for bilateral imports over the period 2017-2022. In essence, the sample period includes actual data and forecast data (2017) (2018) (2019) (2020) (2021) (2022) . The benefits of forward looking data are twofold. First, it allows for estimation of the trade effects of economic integration associated with recently formed trade agreements, for example, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada that came into effect in September 2017. Second, the trade effects of economic disintegration associated with the planned exit of the UK from the EU can also be estimated. In other words, the potential trade effects of Brexit coincide with the planned date of departure in contrast to the existing literature that conduct counterfactual trade policy scenarios on time scales before Brexit actually occurs.",

On the other hand, trade with the rest of the world would rise by nearly a half. In aggregate, UK bilateral trade with all countries would decline by 6% and 13% under the hard Brexit and the hard Brexit plus scenarios respectively, but these losses would be partially offset by the global Britain strategy (5%).

As an indirect way of testing the Linder (1961) hypothesis, Gruber and Vernon (1970) merge the separate roles of income per capita into the per capita income differential, DGDPPC t ij . A negative coefficient, suggesting trade is positively related to consumers with similar per capita incomes and therefore having similar consumption patterns, indicates support for the Linder hypothesis. In contrast, a positive coefficient suggests trade is driven more by differing per capita incomes consistent with the Heckscher-Ohlin model (Heckscher 1919; Ohlin 1933) of relative factor abundance.",

While commonalities between countries should boost trade, landlocked countries tend to be disadvantaged in trade terms because the overland costs of transporting goods are generally higher than shipping costs. The vector of time varying explanatory variables, X t ij , is represented by the log of infrastructure, INFRAS t ij , and EU economic integration agreements, EIA t ij . The inclusion of infrastructure in a model of trade stems from Bougheas et al. (1999) , who suggested that the level of infrastructure can affect trade via its influence on transport costs. They argue that transport costs are not only a function of distance, but also depend on the availability of public infrastructure such as roads, ports and telecommunication networks. Therefore, they augment the gravity model with direct measures of transport infrastructure, including the length of the motorway network. As trade depends inversely on transport costs and transport costs depend inversely on infrastructure, a positive relationship between the level of infrastructure and the volume of trade is predicted. Along these lines, Francois and Manchin (2013) assess the trade effect of both physical (air transport and roads) and communications infrastructure while Carr\u00e8re (2006) quantifies the trade effect of infrastructure by constructing an index based on four variables (road density, roads paved, railways and telephone lines). Accordingly, Eq. (2) includes two measures of physical infrastructure, namely the log of the summed value of air freight, ln AIR t ij , and similarly for rail lines, ln RAIL t ij . While the former is important in transporting high value, small volume products such as pharmaceuticals and technology overseas, the latter-critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of export economies-remains an important mode of transporting bulk and manufactured goods overland.",

Many studies have included bilateral fixed effects to control for unobserved time invariant heterogeneity (see, for example, Baier and Bergstrand 2007; Bergstrand et al. 2015) . These studies have additionally included country time fixed effects to account for time varying exporter and importer multilateral heterogeneity. Indeed, the generalised gravity model for a panel (with both cross sectional and time dimensions) should include (time invariant) bilateral dummies, ij , to capture the omission of trade determinants across country pairs and time varying country dummies, t i and t j , to capture the variation of multilateral resistance over time (Baldwin and Taglioni 2006) , where time specific effects, t , are interacted with the country fixed effects. The generalised gravity model, however, is problematic in so far as greater data availability and larger panel datasets can incur an excessive number of fixed effects. Moreover, the time invariant variables, Z ij , are subsumed into the country pair dummies and hence cannot be estimated directly. Similarly, the effects of GDP are largely captured by the time varying country dummies. Indeed, the issue of dimensionality can compromise the analysis of any variable of interest if it shares the same dimension as the fixed effects. Taken together, the inclusion of country pair dummies and time varying country dummies imply the core gravity variables of GDP and distance can no longer be estimated directly.",

As the existing literature does not usually include these types of geographic variables in the gravity model, it is not unreasonable to treat them as excludable from the trade equation. On the other hand, a strong association between geography and PTAs have previously been noted. For example, the WTO (2011) point out that only half of all RTAs are from the same region. Lake and Yildiz (2016) also highlight the importance of geographic characteristics in the choice of PTAs. Indeed, simple correlations suggest these geographic variables may well play an important role in explaining RTAs. 9 By combining instrumental variables estimation with panel data methods, the parameters can be estimated consistently in the presence of unobserved (fixed) effects and endogeneity of the time varying explanatory variables (Wooldridge 2014) . In short, estimating the gravity model specification (2) as a 2SLS regression with time and country fixed effects draws on a combination of theoretical developments 8 An explanatory variable is endogenous if it is correlated with the equation's error term. According to Wooldridge (2002) , endogeneity usually arises in one of three ways: omitted variables, simultaneity and measurement error. 9 The (simple) correlation between the instruments and the EU EIAs (merged into a single dummy) is relatively high (0.54 and 0.93) compared with the correlation between the instruments and imports respectively (0.21 and 0.32).

In addition to controlling for two sources of endogeneity, the relative simplicity and ease of implementation in software are among the main benefits of this approach compared with other methods adopted in the literature. 10",

In other words, earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits, helped by the signing of the 1986 Single European Act that created the Single Market, culminating in the 'four freedoms' relating to goods, services, people and money across EU borders. Indeed, by the fourth subperiod the beneficial effects of EIA membership have dwindled away into insignificance, likely reflecting the fallout of the global financial crisis, its aftermath and the debt crisis in Europe, all of which brought about sharply declining growth of GDP and lower demand for imports. The forecast subperiod, however, suggests a rebound in the trade effect of EU membership, probably linked to the growing importance of intra industry trade and the exchange of similar, but differentiated goods, as suggested by the rising magnitude of the GDP per capita difference coefficient. In contrast, the prospective trade effects of FTAs and the regional EPAs are subdued and even adversarial.",

The gains from colonial linkages have weakened since the 1960s, when many countries gained independence, consistent with the findings of Head et al. (2010) .

Calculating the trade effects of the three alternative counterfactual scenarios amounts to comparing the predicted values of each scenario with the predicted values of the benchmark 'no Brexit' scenario. 23 22 After Brexit, setting new terms of its own with the WTO would be an arduous process involving approval by the other 163 WTO members. As an alternative, all tariffs and quotas in place under existing terms of EU membership could be eliminated, but would be opposed by various sectors including farming and manufacturing. 23 As the predicted values generated from the benchmark and Brexit scenarios are derived from the WEO's data projections, the effects of the various Brexit scenarios intrinsically depend on the data projections and their associated assumptions.

Ideally, an analysis of the trade consequences of Brexit would extend beyond the 2019-2022 period to match the UK's long term membership of the EU since 1973. Kierzenkowski et al. (2016) have previously suggested that the Brexit 'shock' could be transmitted through several channels over time, In the near term, bilateral trade would decline as the loss of unrestricted access to the Single Market and preferential access to third countries would entail higher tariffs and barriers. Heightened economic uncertainty would reduce confidence, potentially affecting the cost and availability of finance and the financing of the current account deficit via changes in capital flows. Migration incentives would also be affected with restrictions on the free movement of labour from the EU and a weaker UK economy after exit. By 2020, these effects could shave off 3% of UK output (equivalent to GB\u00a32200 per household).",

By 2030, UK output could be more than 5% smaller as a non EU member (i.e. between GB\u00a33200 and GB\u00a35000 per household depending on the central or pessimistic scenario).

            "text": "In the post Brexit era, the UK's trade strategy will involve prioritising trade deals with some countries over others. The natural starting point is to agree a trade deal with the EU-the block of countries representing the UK's largest and nearest trading partners-to ensure continued free trade and prevent the imposition of tariffs, barriers and checks on goods arriving into the UK. Rolling over existing trade deals with the EU, agreed while the UK was still a member, is also of paramount importance to avoid disruption for firms. 28 Next up are trade deals with large countries such as the US, China, India and Japan that would provide British exporters with access to large foreign markets and therefore, would likely yield greatest benefits from the UK's perspective. Commonwealth countries-a group of 53 countries with current or historical colonial linkages to Britain-including Australia, Canada and New Zealand are also on the list of high priority trade deals. 29 26 The depth of trade agreements can vary according to provisions relating to tariffs, services liberalisation, investment rules, standards, public procurement, competition, intellectual property rights and other measures capturing varying degrees of trade liberalisation. As part of future work, it would be interesting to also examine the depth of bilateral trade agreements. Bowen et al. (2010) , for example, measure the degree of economic integration across a range of RTAs. For the entire set of PTAs in force and notified to the WTO, Hofmann et al. (2019) evaluate the changing scope of PTAs over time. Using the content of trade agreements to build a measure of depth based on the number of provisions covered by the agreement, Mulabdic et al. (2017) assess UK EU trade relations. 27 For the year 2016, over 50 per cent of the UK's imports come from the EU and over 47 per cent of its exports go to the EU (trade shares as a percentage of world total, IMF 2017). 28 As of March 2020, 19 trade deals (Andean Community, CARIFORUM, Central America, Chile, Eastern and Southern Africa, Faroe Islands, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Morocco, Pacific states, Palestine, SADC, South Korea, Switzerland and Tunisia) have been rolled over and are expected to take effect at the end of the transition period. 29 Shared beliefs in an international rules based system for trade and investment make comprehensive FTAs more likely with some countries. For example, negotiating trade deals with Canada and Japan (which already have trade agreements with the EU) or Australia and New Zealand (which are currently in negotiations with the EU) are likely to be less difficult when compared with China and India. The UK will also have to overcome challenges that have led to the suspension of EU trade talks with India and the US (see the Appendix Table 7 ). Rather than aiming to agree on a full scale FTA, one alternative might involve liberalising economic sectors that matter for the UK (eg financial services) without jeopardising other sensitive sectors (eg food standards in the agricultural sector or drugs prices in the health sector).
