This is a descriptive study. Pandemics constitute a serious problem to global health with a major impact on the affected countries' populations. The recent COVID-19 outbreak represents one of the most important viral pandemics lately. It reached Argentina 64 days after the first case was identified in China. Since then, several measures were taken by the Argentinian government to try to mitigate its impact in this initial stage. An updated report of the current situation and its management in different countries is of vital importance regarding global health issues and may serve for feedback and decision-making.",

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 nations in a matter of weeks. The way in which these outbreaks affect countries depends on multiple factors, and the impact is difficult to foresee. However, updated reports of the current situation are mandatory for local and global scientific communities, the health-care workforce, and government agencies to make decisions based on a dynamic situation analysis.",

Together with this measure, massive media campaigns were launched giving information and establishing guidelines for people to be aware of the disease and its symptoms.",

On March 19th, a total of 16 d after the first case was detected in Argentina, an urgent decree was announced by the former president, establishing compulsory national quarantine until March 31st. By means of this law, free circulation of people was forbidden, only allowing certain people to travel to their workplace. Flights were cancelled, and borders were sealed.",

Compared with the previous pandemic, the 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak, it took just 3 wk for H1N1 to get from Mexico to Argentina. A more coordinated global response to the outbreak, together with a greater geographical distance and less frequency of flights from China to Argentina than from Mexico to Argentina might have had a major impact on the speed at which the virus spread. This factor definitely gave Argentinians the opportunity to design containment plans that could mitigate the spread.",

In relation to the actual number of affected people in the course of this pandemic, the lack of validated diagnostic tests, the delay in the samples' processing, and the absence of proper health-care facilities in smaller cities may have resulted in an under-estimate of the total number of positive cases.",
