While the growth dynamics of single viruses have been well-characterized through both mathematical modeling and experimental studies for several viral diseases (Baccam, Beauchemin, Macken, Hayden, Perelson, 2006, Gonz\u00e1lez-Parra, Dobrovolny, 2015, Gonz\u00e1lez-Parra, Dobrovolny, Aranda, Chen-Charpentier, RAG, 2018, Neumann, Lam, Dahari, Gretch, Wiley, Layden, et al., 1998, Perelson, Neumann, Markowitz, Leonard, Ho, 1996), little is known about the kinetics of coinfection, i.e. simultaneous infection with more than one type of virus. Prevalence of viral coinfections has been identified in many studies, reporting a highly variable detection level of 14\u201370% in hospitalized patients with respiratory infectious viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), adenovirus (AdV), human enterovirus (hEV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human bocavirus (hBoV) (Achten, Wu, Bont, Blanken, Gebretsadik, Chappell, et al., 2017, Asner, Rose, Petrich, Richardson, Tran, 2015, Kenmoe, Tchendjou, Vernet, Tetang, Mossus, Ripa, et al., 2016, Pretorius, Madhi, Cohen, Naidoo, Groome, Moyes, et al., 2012, Scotta, Chakr, de Moura, Becker, de Souza, Jones, et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Although the prognostic significance of coinfection is still poorly understood, there is growing evidence in clinical studies that respiratory tract coinfection affects severity of the infectious disease (Costa, DAO, da Silveira, Neto, de Paula, TFMS, et al., 2014, Mazur, Bont, Cohen, Cohen, von Gottberg, Groome, et al., 2017, Scotta, Chakr, de Moura, Becker, de Souza, Jones, et al., 2016). Many clinical surveys on respiratory coinfections find that the presence of more than one viral infection at the same time causes not only increased disease severity compared to single viral infections (Aberle, Aberle, Pracher, Hutter, Kundi, Popow-Kraupp, 2005, Choi, Chung, Kim, 2015) but also contributes to acute exacerbation and longer hospital stay among patients with pulmonary diseases such as asthma (GGM et al., 2017), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Dai et al., 2015) and bronchiolitis (Richard et al., 2008). For example, several studies on pediatric coinfections with RSV, IAV, AdV and HRV find that children with lower respiratory tract coinfection stay longer in hospital (Aberle, Aberle, Pracher, Hutter, Kundi, Popow-Kraupp, 2005, Costa, DAO, da Silveira, Neto, de Paula, TFMS, et al., 2014, Martin, Fairchok, Stednick, Kuypers, Englund, 2013, Mazur, Bont, Cohen, Cohen, von Gottberg, Groome, et al., 2017), suffer higher incidence of fever (Calvo et al., 2008) and require life threatening disease supports like mechanical ventilation and ICU admission (Mazur et al., 2017) in comparison to children infected singly with RSV, IAV, AdV or HRV. Besides children, there is evidence that coinfections can be more severe in adults. One study finds that hospitalized adult patients experience chronic lung disease when infected with multiple respiratory viruses (Choi et al., 2015). There is some evidence that respiratory infections can be particularly long-lasting, over a year in some cases, in immunocompromised patients (Dobrovolny, Reddy, Kamal, Rayner, CAA, 2013, Egli, Bucher, Dumoulin, Stern, Buser, Bubendorf, et al., 2012, Loubet, Voiriot, Houhou-Fidouh, Neuville, Bouadma, Lescure, et al., 2017), with more recent studies indicating that at least some of these long-lasting infections are viral coinfections (Egli, Bucher, Dumoulin, Stern, Buser, Bubendorf, et al., 2012, Loubet, Voiriot, Houhou-Fidouh, Neuville, Bouadma, Lescure, et al., 2017). Respiratory viruses interact in unique ways within different age groups and with different viral combinations which can result in altered disease severity compared to how they behave in single infections.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, few experimental studies on coinfection are conducted in vivo or in vitro with different respiratory infectious viruses. Existing studies of coinfection have been mostly done with parasites such as bacteria (Smith et al., 2013), human malaria (Taylor et al., 1997), mosquito-borne dengue strains (Pepin and Hanley, 2008), animal viruses (Klemme et al., 2016), plant viruses (Susi et al., 2015) or non respiratory viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis B virus (Bellecave et al., 2009) in laboratories. Shinjoh et al. (2000) were the first to design an in vitro experimental study to determine the growth interference ability of IAV and RSV in a single cell. Their study showed that simultaneous infection with RSV and IAV in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells led to growth suppression of RSV infection due to the faster growing IAV infection; however the suppression of RSV infection was overcome by initiating IAV infection a few days after the initiation of RSV infection. Using immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, they also observed IAV-RSV interactions at the level of viral protein synthesis where both viruses were found to replicate independently and release their surface antigens selectively from the infected cell during the budding period. They argued that the growth inhibition of RSV was due to the reduced cellular capacity for viral production, since both viruses competed for intracellular resources such as proteins or amino acids for their maturation. Another recent study of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles as viral detection probes within cells has shown that not only different strains of the same virus, but also different respiratory viruses can infect the same cell (Fayyadh et al., 2017). Using the proposed QD probe, researchers detected AdV and IAV at different subcellular levels of the same infected human bronchial epithelial (A549) cell and found similar growth inhibition of one virus due to the presence of the other virus as the Shinjoh et al. (2000) experiment. An in vivo study observed a similar kind of blocking interaction with avian influenza virus and new castle disease virus in poultry (Shengqiang et al., 2012). Additionally, other in vivo studies also noticed a sequential combination of viruses can control viral activities during coinfection (Laurie, Guarnaccia, Carolan, AWC, Aban, Petrie, et al., 2015, Shengqiang, Zheng, Zhao, Liu, Liu, Sun, et al., 2012). Thus coinfection can lead to complex infection dynamics for two or more viruses.",

In order to understand the effects of coinfection at the within host cellular level, it is critical to know the mechanisms of interaction between the viruses and cells. Since viruses are known to infect the same cell during coinfection (Fayyadh, Ma, Qin, Zhang, Li, Zhang, et al., 2017, Shinjoh, Omoe, Saito, Matsuo, Nerome, 2000), we integrate superinfection, i.e. simultaneous infection of two different viruses in the same cell, and cellular regeneration as potential mechanisms of interaction in the model. Our model shows that these interactions alter the effect of coinfection on disease outcomes in the human respiratory tract. We find that having superinfection along with cellular regeneration can lead to chronic coinfection, which cannot occur with either mechanism alone.",

In addition, target cells regenerate at a constant rate, r, and decay naturally at a rate, a. Both kinds of infected target cells undergo eclipse phases where viruses exhibit intra-cellular activities to take over the host\u2019s cellular mechanisms to produce viral genomes (RNA). We assume that the second virus can still infect the cells in eclipse phases such that E\n1 get infected with the second virus, V\n2, at a rate \u03b2\n21 and E\n2 get infected by the first virus, V\n1, at a rate \u03b2\n12. Thus cells in the eclipse phases become functional target cells for the other virus and these dually infected eclipse cells are called superinfected eclipse cells, E\n3. We further assume that once cells are infectious, they can no longer be infected by another virus. As soon as the eclipse phases are ready to produce viruses after the time durations of 1k1,\n1k2 and 1k3, they become infectious cells, I\n1, I\n2 and I\n3. I\n1 and I\n2 produce viruses at rates, p\n1 and p\n2 while the superinfected infectious cells, I\n3, produce viruses of both types V\n1 and V\n2, at rates p\n12 and p\n21 respectively. These infectious cells produce viruses throughout their lifespans of 1\u03b41,\n1\u03b42 and 1\u03b43. Viruses of both types, V\n1 and V\n2, decay at rates c\n1 and c\n2 respectively.

We are interested in studying the mechanisms behind chronic coinfections, which occur more often in immunocompromised patients. Thus a complete lack of explicit immune response makes sense. Second, since we do not have any experimental data that explains immune response with respect to coinfection of two different viruses, our model does not explicitly account for any immune responses, however, this can be incorporated implicitly in the superinfection parameters, i.e. death rates of dually infected cells, 1\u03b43, superinfectivity rates, \u03b2ij, and viral production rates from superinfected cells, pij, in the model. Moreover, studies show superinfection may cause both enhanced (Mosquera, Adler, 1998, Nowak, May, 1994) and reduced (Brown et al., 2002) production of viruses; we assume that superinfected infectious cells produce each type of virus at different rates, p\n12 and p\n21, than that of the singly infected cells so that we can explore the pathological consequences due to the different replication rates. Also it is reported that the susceptibility of target cells changes due to the occurrence of earlier infection (Anestad, Vainio, Hungnes, 2007, Laurie, Guarnaccia, Carolan, AWC, Aban, Petrie, et al., 2015, Simeonov, Gong, Kim, Poss, Chiaromonte, Fricks, 2010). For example, infection by one virus may increase the probability of being subsequently infected by other types since the first infection may weaken a host\u2019s immunity or resistance (Soares et al., 2016). Another study showed that primary infection evokes an immune response which reduces the chance for secondary infection (Devevey, Dang, Graves, Murray, Brisson, 2015, Klemme, Louhi, Karvonen, 2016, Susi, Barr\u00e8s, Vale, Laine, 2015). So we consider different infection rates for superinfection to explore the possible outcomes. Lastly, we also allow the transition rate of superinfected eclipse phases and death rate of superinfected infectious cells to vary across a range of acceptable parameter values for both viruses based. While there is no direct experimental examination of eclipse phases or infectious cell lifespans during coinfection, since viruses are sharing the cell\u2019s resources (Shinjoh et al., 2000), it seems possible that the speed at which virions are produced is altered. On a larger scale, the observation by Laurie et al. (2015) that in a ferret model of human influenza, subsequent influenza infections with different strains (H1N1, H3N2, IBV) limits the time duration of virus replication also suggests that these transition rates are altered.",

The average lifespan of airway epithelial cells ranges from 6\u201318 months, which is much longer than the average time it takes to infect a target cell by a respiratory virus (Rawlins and BLM, 2008). Although there is negligible natural target cell death before the cells are infected, we include this rate to make the model more biologically appropriate. We look for a steady state with non-zero values for both V\n1 and V\n2, since this is the chronic coinfection equilibrium. Then we evaluate the stability of the equilibrium to determine whether there are parameter values for which it is a stable steady state. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results of the stability study by applying numerical simulations with one of the common coinfection pairs reported in clinical studies. Sensitivity analysis of this model is also shown in a supplemental document [see Additional file].",

The dominant eigenvalue of the matrix FV\u22121 is equal to R0, and the expression isR0=max(R01,R02),whereR0i=\u03b2ipiTci\u03b4ifori=1,2.For the values of R0>1, the infection free equilibrium, Q1*, is unstable, i.e. infection grows and converges to the chronic coinfection state, Q2*. On the other hand, for R0<1, the infection free state, Q1*, will be globally asymptotically stable.

The viral titer increases with increasing regeneration rates; the more rapidly cells are being regenerated, the larger the sustained viral load. This dependence is stronger for IAV than for RSV, suggesting that as cells become available more rapidly, IAV infects the cells more effectively. We also investigate the variation in peak load of infected cells by varying regeneration rate, r (Fig. 4, bottom). While singly infected infectious cells slightly increase with increasing regeneration for both viruses, the superinfected infectious population increases much more rapidly. This is further evidence that the chronic coinfection is maintained by the superinfected cell population rather than singly infected cells.",

            "text": "Cell regeneration is a natural process which can allow secondary infection to take hold even if primary infection has infected the initial supply of target cells. However, this mechanism is usually neglected during acute respiratory infection because these infections are short, 1\u20132 weeks in length compared to the average regeneration time of the epithelial cells ( \u223c 30 days (Beauchemin, Handel, 2011, Beers, Morrisey, 2011)). Here, we examine the implications of this assumption in the context of superinfection.(2)Targetcell:T\u02d9=\u2212\u03b21TV1\u2212\u03b22TV2,in model (1) we set the cell regeneration rate, r, and natural cell death rate, a, equal to zero. We will call this special case of model (1) model (2). In this case, we find only the infection free equilibrium, Q1*=(T*,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). The equilibrium point, Q1*, represents two possible scenarios: (a) the system does not have an infection at all, but rather all the target cells remain uninfected (equal to the initial value, T\n0) with any initial virus clearing before an infection starts; (b) an acute infection when target cells, T*, are equal to zero, meaning all the susceptible cells of the system have been infected and killed by the two viruses. We will call this second scenario Q11*. As there are no more resources left for the viruses to infect, both of the viruses die eventually and the system becomes free of infection. To determine the stability of the infection free equilibrium, we linearize the model about the equilibrium points, Q1* and Q11*, then calculate the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation of the linearized system. We find that the eigenvalues of the equilibrium point, Q11*, are 0,\u2212c1,\u2212c2,\u2212\u03b41,\u2212\u03b42,\u2212\u03b43,\u2212k1,\u2212k2 and \u2212k3. For this trivial equilibrium point, Q11*, all the eigenvalues are negative or zero indicating that the point is locally stable. The eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue lies along the target cell, T, axis where we have a continuum of equilibrium points. The eigenvalues of the other infection free equilibrium, Q1* are 0,\u2212\u03b43,\u2212k3, and roots of functions Fi(\u03bb), where Fi(\u03bb) is given byFi(\u03bb)=\u03bb3+\u03bb2(ci+\u03b4i+ki)+\u03bb(ci\u03b4i+\u03b4iki+ciki)+(ci\u03b4iki\u2212\u03b2ipikiT),for i=1,2. The infection free equilibrium, Q1*, is stable only if the following inequality is satisfied so that the roots of both F\n1 and F\n2 are negative;R0i<1,whereR0i=\u03b2ipiTci\u03b4i.\n",

Superinfection with two viruses of different virulence results in faster cell consumption than single viral infection (Fig. 5, bottom left). During superinfection, target cells are consumed rapidly compared to single viral infection but maintain almost the same viral load for IAV and reduced viral load for RSV forcing it to decay faster; since now viruses are not only competing for target cells at the extracellular level but also at the intracellular level. Superinfected cell kinetics for both the eclipse phase and the infectious phase are also shown in Fig. 5 (bottom middle and right).

Fig. 7\nshows the coinfection duration as a function of pairs of the superinfection parameters. Considering the single infection rates as baseline values (given in Table 1 and indicated by star on the images) for superinfection, we vary the superinfection parameters on either side of the baseline to account for possible enhanced or diminished biological properties due to superinfection. The top graph shows the dependence on superinfection rates; the middle graph shows the dependence on k\n3 and \u03b4\n3; and the bottom graph shows the dependence on superinfection production rates. In the figure, the blue region indicates parameter values for which one viral infection is suppressed by the other viral infection; thus showing reduced duration, while the red region represents prolonged duration of coinfection. According to the top graph, both lower and higher values of superinfection rates give shorter coinfection duration than the single RSV or IAV infection duration. If IAV can reinfect the RSV infected cells as easily as it can infect the uninfected cells, duration of coinfection can be as long as about 1 week irrespective of RSV\u2019s ability to superinfect, although coinfection duration seems to be less sensitive to changes in superinfection rates than the other parameters. In the middle graph, we see that different combinations of k\n3 and \u03b4\n3 give different coinfection durations with coinfection duration increasing as both k\n3 and \u03b4\n3 decrease. Biologically this means that if superinfection causes viruses to utilize more time for intracellular activities (attachment, entry, uncoating, biosynthesis) and causes superinfected infectious cells to have a longer life span compared to single viral infections, duration of coinfection can prolong beyond 9 days. In the last graph, superinfection production rates have the most complex effect on coinfection duration with IAV superinfection production rate increases leading to longer coinfection durations, but RSV superinfection production rate increases having the opposite effect.",

In Fig. 8\n, we examine how changes in superinfection parameters affect the peak viral loads of IAV and RSV in coinfection. We see that the production rates of superinfected cells influence peak viral load more than other superinfection parameters. Peak viral load for IAV and RSV are not, respectively, more than 107.2 and 103.6 PFU/mL even if the average transition time of superinfected eclipse cells to infectious cells and the death rate are short ( \u223c 2.4 hours) along with the slowest death rate of infectious cells. Similarly, a large variation in superinfection rates of IAV and RSV does not produce peak viral load higher than production rates from superinfected cells. Conversely, the peak viral loads can be as high as 109 PFU/mL due to superinfection if virus production rates are as high as 1010 PFU/mL d\u22121. Although IAV produces almost similar peak viral load to RSV for a wider range of production rates (1\u22121010 PFU/mL d\u22121), RSV only reaches higher peak viral load when both of them produce more than 108 PFU/mL d\u22121. Thus, if superinfection production rates are higher than production rates in singly infected cells, the peak loads of each virus can be increased. This is not a likely scenario, however, since viruses are competing for intracellular resources (Fayyadh, Ma, Qin, Zhang, Li, Zhang, et al., 2017, Shinjoh, Omoe, Saito, Matsuo, Nerome, 2000), so it is more likely that superinfected cells will produce less of a particular virus than singly infected cells.

This work shows that superinfection alone is also not sufficient for chronic coinfections. When new cells are available for both viruses during the course of coinfection, the virus with the higher growth rate will infect more of the available cells than the slower-growing virus. On the other hand, the slower-growing virus which infected fewer cells in the previous cycle will infect even fewer cells in every subsequent cycle of infection, eventually disappearing. However, if there is superinfection, the slower-growing virus does not have to be the first to infect a particular cell \u2014 it can infect a particular cell after the faster-growing virus has already infected the cell. In this way, replication of both viruses can be maintained indefinitely. This is supported by our observation that chronic coinfection is maintained by the superinfected cells.",

            "text": "While our model suggests one possible mechanism for chronic coinfections, particularly suitable for immunocompromised patients, the model is simple and neglects many of the complex biological process underlying virus-cell and virus-virus interactions. These processes can give rise to other mechanisms that could possibly lead to chronic coinfections. Perhaps the most glaring omission in the model is the lack of an immune response, which can be an important mechanism for interaction between the two viruses (Hodgson et al., 2004). A suggested mechanism for chronic coinfection via immune interaction is through the innate immune response. When a pathogen invades a host for the first time, a nonspecific innate immune response is immediately elicited. During subsequent infection it can be weakened enough due to the primary infection to let the nearby cells be more susceptible to a secondary viral infection (Simeonov et al., 2010). This antagonistic effect on the primary virus can facilitate access for another viral infection which can persist at the same time (Mideo, 2009). Introducing the immune responses to the model will allow for exploration of these mechanisms of virus-cell interactions. Unfortunately, the inclusion of additional parameters to address immune responses in the model has to be calibrated with a sufficient amount of experimental data that is not readily available. Another possible mechanism for chronic coinfections is cell tropism. Respiratory viruses are reported to show cell tropism, which is a viral preference for certain types of cells (Matrosovich et al., 2015). So two different viruses may infect different respiratory cell types, limiting competition for host cells because of resource partitioning (Hodgson et al., 2004). Thus both viruses may coexist in the respiratory tract for longer times and might also contribute to more virus production since now they have exclusive access to certain cells. Again, a mathematical model extended to include two distinct cell populations would allow exploration of the conditions necessary for chronic viral coinfections in this scenario.",

            "text": "The model also makes a number of assumptions about the superinfection process. Since experimental observations of this process are still in the early stages, there is not much known about the details. For example, we limit a cell\u2019s susceptibility to a second infection to the eclipse phase of the first virus. There is, as yet, no experimental evidence to inform us of how long an infected cell remains susceptible to a secondary infection. We also allow for the infectious lifespan and eclipse phase duration of superinfected cells to differ from singly infected cells. This is motivated by the idea that viruses share internal resources (Shinjoh et al., 2000), which might slow production of proteins and RNA, thereby lengthening the eclipse phase duration. But other mechanisms might alter the rates of internal protein and RNA production. Infection of a cell induces cellular responses that inhibit the replication of the virus (Tang, Na, Zhu, Shen, Yang, Fu, et al., 2014, Tian, Guo, Wei, Yang, He, Wang, 2012, Xue, Fu, Ma, Zhang, Li, Feng, et al., 2018) while viruses have developed mechanisms to prevent these responses (Wang et al., 2014). Thus, if one of the viruses involved in the superinfection can inhibit a cellular response that suppresses viral replication, the other virus can be produced more quickly than it would if it were infecting the cell alone. Finally, we assumed that a superinfected cell starts producing both viruses and stops producing both viruses at the same time. In all likelihood, the time at which a cell starts and stops producing virus is determined by the time elapsed since the cell was infected by a particular virus. Since individual cells are not infected with both viruses simultaneously, they will not start producing virus simultaneously. Addition of age-structure to within host models does not alter the long-term dynamics of the model (Browne, 2015, Browne, Pilyugin, 2013, Holder, Simon, Liao, Abed, Bouhy, CAA, et al., 2011), but does change the duration of the infection, so addition of more accurate age structure will likely alter the coinfection duration. These details will need to be explored experimentally so that they can be added to more detailed models of coinfection.",

Additionally, chronic coinfections have the potential to spread viral infections broadly within the human population since one person is shedding two different viruses over a long period of time. In such cases, treatment becomes an important consideration. Treatment of only one of the viruses could result in growth of a potentially harmful virus that was suppressed to some extent by the presence of the other virus. Antiviral treatment can be more efficient in treating superinfecting viruses if a broad spectrum antiviral is used, allowing for simultaneous treatment of both viruses (Calenda et al., 2017).",
