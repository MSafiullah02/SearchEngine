Neutropenic fever is defined as a single temperature higher than 38.3 \u00b0C or a sustained temperature greater than 38.0 \u00b0C for more than 1 h, in the presence of an absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) less than 1500 cells/mm3, though many centers and guidelines use an ANC cutoff of less than 500 cells/mm3 [28, 33]. Exceedingly common in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, neutropenic fever is a medical emergency which requires urgent initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Any oncologic patient receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy is at risk of developing neutropenia and opportunistic infections, but profound neutropenia with life-threatening infectious complications is most commonly seen in patients with hematologic malignancies. This can occur during aplasia and before engraftment in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or from disease-related or treatment-induced cytopenias in other hematologic malignancy patients.",

Viral pathogens include respiratory viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza), reactivated or de novo herpes viruses (e.g., herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus), and many other potential candidates. Bacterial infections may arise from gut translocation, oral mucosal translocation, infection of indwelling vascular catheters, skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonias, and urinary sources. Fungal infections typically arise from gut translocation, fungal pneumonias (e.g., aspergillosis), and vascular catheters.

Whereas in the past gram-negative organisms were commonly cultured, gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci, are currently the most commonly isolated bacteria [28, 50] (Table 1). This shift is presumably due to the increased use of long-term indwelling vascular catheters and may also be affected by increased use of prophylaxis against gram-negative organisms [50, 59]. Though gram-positive infections are more common, gram-negative infections confer a higher risk of mortality [77]. Fungal infections, particularly Candida and Aspergillus, are also frequent, especially in patients with prolonged or profound neutropenia [33]. Respiratory viruses can be isolated in approximately 20% of patients [34]. Despite best efforts, no causative organism can be identified in about 50% of cases of neutropenic fever [28, 33].",

Circulating leukocytes are not replaced as they reach the end of their life span, and neutropenia ensues. Circulating neutrophils have a short life span in the peripheral blood [43], so neutropenia develops rapidly after myelosuppressive therapy. Depending on the chemotherapy employed, circulating neutrophils and other white blood cells may also be damaged or destroyed, causing a more rapid leukopenia than regimens which only affect the marrow. Some agents will injure progenitor cells but not primitive stem cells (which re-populate the progenitor cells), whereas other agents will injure all cells in the marrow [44].",

In addition to their key role in the response to localized infections (e.g., pneumonia), in sepsis neutrophils are rapidly recruited to organs (lungs, kidneys, liver) and are thought to contribute to tissue damage and organ dysfunction [45]. Neutrophils also contribute to resolution of injury and tissue repair [36], as well as regulation of the adaptive immune response [40, 76]. Thus neutropenic patients are not only deficient in the immediate response to infection but also have an altered physiology regarding the development of systemic inflammation and sepsis and in the regulation of the immune response to injury and tissue repair. It is increasingly unclear whether neutropenic sepsis (and the organ damage sequelae) is the same disease as non-neutropenic sepsis.",

Though the total effect of lymphopenia on the pathophysiology of neutropenic fever and infection remains to be fully determined, patients with neutropenic sepsis have different cytokineprofiles than patients with non-neutropenic sepsis: neutropenic patients have higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and G-CSF than non-neutropenic patients [60]. Monocytes are also dysfunctional in neutropenic sepsis, with evidence not only of deactivation of monocytes in peripheral blood but also of deactivation of differentiated pulmonary macrophages in patients with neutropenic sepsis [48, 49].",

Most neutropenic patients are thrombocytopenic, and platelets are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the immune response [23, 74]. Thrombocytopenia is associated with poor outcomes in critical illness, including in sepsis [18]. In addition to secreting mediators and regulators of inflammation, platelets interact with neutrophils and monocytes and play a vital role in the defense against bacterial, viral, and fungal infectionsvia the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [16, 21, 23]. Platelets also play roles in the development and resolution of organ failure in inflammatory states, including sepsis. In particular, thrombocytopenia has been demonstrated to potentiate lung injury [46, 86], and platelets may play a role in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury [23]. While the role of thrombocytopenia in infection remains incompletely elucidated, it seems clear that thrombocytopenia is an important factor in the pathophysiology of neutropenic infection.",

The most important of these is injury to the mucosal barrier of the intestinal tract [13, 14, 78]. Disruption of this barrier, which can occur throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, creates portals through which enteric pathogens, including bacteria and yeast, can enter the bloodstream. This is an important source of gram-positive, gram-negative, and fungal infections in neutropenic patients. The respiratory system is also affected in neutropenia. Not only are pulmonary macrophages known to be qualitatively dysfunctional in neutropenic sepsis [48, 49], but quantitative cell counts of alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils are decreased during neutropenia [19]. Neutropenia also appears to adversely affect lung repair after injury [12]. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that neutropenic sepsis has a significantly different pathophysiology than non-neutropenic sepsis. ",

While some patients are asymptomatic in the presence of neutropenic fever, many describe non-specific symptoms (e.g., cough, anorexia, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, myalgias, confusion, behavioral changes). Patients may also present with respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, sinus pain or drainage) or abdominal symptoms such as pain or diarrhea. Fewer than half of patients will feel feverish, shiver, or have rigors [17]. Presentation to the hospital can be delayed, with one study suggesting a mean delay in presentation of 11 h and nearly 40% of patients delaying presentation for more than 12 h [17].

Additional laboratory studies at presentation should include complete blood count with differential, electrolytes, and markers of renal and hepatic function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, transaminases). Depending on the clinical scenario, strong consideration should be given to obtaining an arterial blood gas, coagulation studies, and lactate level [33]. Lactate is of particular potential interest, as an elevated level may help detect early evidence of sepsis-induced malperfusion [33, 70]. Other microbiologic studies can be targeted toward patient-specific indicators. For example, urinary symptoms or an abnormal urinalysis should prompt urine cultures. Diarrhea, especially in a patient treated with antibiotics, should prompt evaluation for Clostridium difficile colitis. Fungal markers such as galactomannan or beta-D-glucan may be useful in some patients [33].

In most cases, this can be done noninvasively [6, 8, 10]. Bronchoscopy may be indicated in some patients, but the benefits of potential diagnosis must be weighed against the risk of requiring endotracheal intubation during bronchoscopy. Abdominal symptoms (pain, diarrhea) should lead to consideration of neutropenic enterocolitis, also known as typhlitis, which is an incompletely understood condition of ileocolonic inflammation which can lead to intestinal necrosis and perforation and is associated with a high mortality rate [63, 64]. Diagnosis requires the presence of neutropenia, bowel wall thickening >4 mm over a >30 mm longitudinal distance, fever >38 \u00b0C, and abdominal pain [31, 51, 63]. Specific diagnosis is elusive in many patients, and diagnostic steps should be repeated if no source is found and fevers persist for 72\u201396 h. Repeat blood cultures and repeat or expanded imaging studies may provide additional diagnostic information.",

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score (Table 4) [35] was developed to predict which patients with neutropenic fever may be safely treated as outpatients. A score \u226521 identifies a standard risk patient, whereas a score <21 indicates a high-risk patient. Additional criteria for outpatient treatment have been enumerated by Heinz et al. [33]; these focus on signs of clinical and social stability, with particular emphasis placed on expected good adherence to oral medications, adequate social support (the patient does not live alone), and the ability to present to the hospital within 60 min. It should be noted that the MASCC score has limited utility in predicting either the risk of critical illness or ICU outcomes. Other factors which influence risk stratification include the depth and duration of neutropenia, with an ANC \u2264100 cells/mm3 and >7 days duration, respectively, being markers of a high-risk patient [28]. Accordingly, neutropenic patients with a hematologic malignancy or status post HSCT are almost always higher risk than patients who become neutropenic during the course of cyclic treatment for a solid malignancy. Comorbid conditions should also be integrated into any clinical risk assessment.",

The rationale for antibacterial prophylaxis is to reduce the risk of gram-negative infections and streptococcal infection from oral mucositis. In high-risk patients, current guidelines suggest antibacterial prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, with the latter preferred if severe mucositis is anticipated [29, 30]. Antifungal prophylaxis against yeast is recommended in high-risk patients (HSCT, chemotherapy for leukemia) with fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, or an echinocandin (caspofungin or micafungin). Anti-mold (Aspergillus) prophylaxis (with voriconazole or posaconazole) is recommended in patients undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia or patients with anticipated very prolonged neutropenia or prior invasive mold infection [28]. Antiviral prophylaxis acyclovir or valacyclovir is recommended for patients who are seropositive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and for varicella zoster virus (VZV)-seropositive HSCT patients. Finally, leukemia and HSCT patients should receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. These prophylactic antimicrobials may lessen, but do not eliminate the risk infections while neutropenic; thus, patients and caregivers must remain vigilant for the development of fever. Moreover, attention must be paid to the prophylactic regimen, as it will affect the choice of empiric antibiotics for neutropenic fever.",

Some data suggest that even delays in antibiotic administration beyond 30 min are associated with increased mortality [62]. As noted above, it is desirable to obtain blood cultures if possible before antibiotic initiation, so long as this does not delay antibiotic administration. No other diagnostic maneuvers should be attempted before antibiotic initiation. Empiric antibiotics must cover the common organisms discussed above (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcal species) and should also be tailored according to prior patient-specific culture data and institutional epidemiology [28, 33]. Appropriate empiric antibiotics include an antipseudomonal penicillin (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam), or antipseudomonal cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime), or a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem) [28, 33]. Some data suggest improved outcomes with prolonged antibiotic infusion times [58] though these data require confirmation. Fluoroquinolones, which are frequently used as prophylactic therapy in neutropenia, should not be used as empiric monotherapy in neutropenic fever due to the possibility of resistance. Though gram-positive organisms are common causes of neutropenic fever, vancomycin is not routinely indicated, but should be added in the presence of suspected catheter-related infection, soft tissue infection, oral mucositis, radiographically proven pneumonia, known colonization with resistant gram-positive organisms (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus), or hemodynamic instability [28, 33, 57].",

Additionally, antipseudomonal cephalosporins or penicillins should be escalated to a carbapenem (e.g., meropenem), and strong consideration should be given to the addition of an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, or aztreonam [28, 33, 57, 61].",

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia affects a substantial portion (10\u201335%) of patients during induction therapy for leukemia or after HSCT and is associated with significantly worse outcomes [3, 53, 85]. Early treatment with agents active against VRE such as linezolid or daptomycin may improve outcomes. Predictive models are being developed to assist with early identification of patients who might benefit from early initiation of antibiotics active against VRE [83]. Similarly, MDR gram-negative infections, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, are associated with high mortality rates, especially among allogeneic HSCT patients [66]. Successful treatment of these infections requires early use of multidrug antibiotic regimens, typically including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and polymyxins. The use of surveillance rectal cultures, performed pre-transplant and then weekly after HSCT, to identify patients with MDR infections and allow immediate initiation of antibiotic therapy targeted against MDR organisms may result in better outcomes [26].",

Appropriate antifungals should have activity against molds, especially aspergillosis; examples include liposomal amphotericin, caspofungin, and voriconazole, though the data are more robust in favor of the former two [33, 81, 82]. Fluconazole should not be used as empiric therapy.

One randomized controlled trial suggests that empiric antibiotics may be safely discontinued after a patient has defervesced and remained afebrile for 72 h, regardless of whether neutrophil recovery has occurred [2]. Another recent paper suggested that it is safe to withhold antibacterial therapy in children with neutropenic fever in whom infection with a respiratory virus has been proven [65].

If treated appropriately, neutropenic fever is a common, predictable, and manageable complication of cytotoxic therapy or HSCT. Neutropenic sepsis continues to confer a poor prognosis, with recent data suggesting an approximate 46% mortality rate in patients with hematologic malignancies who develop septic shock [7, 39, 47]. Predictors of mortality include sepsis after allogeneic HSCT, the presence of graft vs host disease, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, positive blood cultures, cardiac failure, renal failure, and hepatic failure [38, 47]. Younger age (<70 years) and the presence of neutropenic enterocolitis are associated with improved survival [47].",

The emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is a major concern, and there is an urgent need for novel antibiotics to address this threat. Along these lines, additional work needs to be done to identify patients in whom antibiotic therapy can be safely de-escalated. The pathophysiology of neutropenic sepsis requires further study and efforts made to facilitate earlier diagnosis and identification of pathogens in neutropenic patients. Finally, neutropenic sepsis should be studied as a specific and separate entity from \u201cnormal\u201d sepsis, and efficacy of interventions confirmed in this specific population.",
