T RM cells share many properties with effector-memory T cells (T EM cells), including genetic architecture poised for cytokine production and robust cytolytic activity 2, 4 . Despite these functional similarities, T RM cells are defined by a unique core transcriptional signature that supports long-term tissue residence through the regulation of cell-trafficking molecules and adaptations that enable survival in the tissue microenvironment 5, 6 . These adaptations allow for long-term protection by T RM cells in sites such as the skin and gut, where they can provide almost sterilizing immunity when present in sufficient numbers 1, 3 . In contrast, the efficacy of cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens gradually wanes, and this decline is associated with the progressive loss of virus-specific T RM cells in the lung 7, 8 . However, the mechanisms driving the transient nature of lung T RM cells are not well defined.",

Evidence from animal models and humans indicates that memory CD8 + T cells confer protective immunity to respiratory viruses by substantially decreasing viral loads, limiting immunopathology and lowering disease burden 7, 8, [12] [13] [14] . The lung CD8 + T RM cell pool comprises two distinct populations: airway T RM (A-T RM ) cells and interstitial T RM (I-T RM ) cells, with unique functional properties. A-T RM cells are poorly cytolytic compared with I-T RM cells, yet are sufficient to protect against influenza challenge through the rapid production of antiviral cytokines 15 . In addition, the number of A-T RM cells correlates with the efficacy of cellular immune protection in the lung 8 . These findings have raised questions about the requirements for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct populations of lung T RM cells, and about how environmental niches shape the function and lifespan of these cells, but the molecular underpinnings of differences between A-T RM and I-T RM cells have not been explored to date.",

However, T RM cells in the lung and other barrier tissues have a consistent transcriptional profile, raising questions as to why the lifespan of T RM cells would vary between tissues 6, [17] [18] [19] . One potential explanation for these conflicting findings is that lung T RM cells have often been investigated as a single population, without separation into A-T RM and I-T RM cell subsets. Given the functional differences between these subsets and the distinct environments where they reside, a detailed comparison of A-T RM and I-T RM cells could be informative about the mechanisms that control their biology and regulate the decline of lung T RM cells.",

We observed that A-T RM and I-T RM subsets were gradually lost due to apoptosis in the tissue, and transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis (ATAC) revealed an enrichment of genes in A-T RM cells associated with the integrated stress response (ISR), notably the amino acid starvation pathway. These stress-related programs were due to the airway environment, whereas core T RM signature genes were regulated during the initial differentiation of A-T RM cells after infection. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the role of environmental cues in controlling the differential functions and lifespan of A-T RM and I-T RM cells, and identify pathways that may be manipulated to improve the longevity of cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens.",

The PR8-challenged mice showed progressively more weight loss (Fig. 1a) and decreased survival (Fig. 1b) as time from the initial infection with x31 increased. To determine the kinetics of the loss of flu-specific A-T RM and I-T RM cells in the lung, we analyzed the number of influenza nucleoprotein (FluNP) + and acid polymerase (FluPA) + CD8 + T cells on days 8, 10, 14, 21, 35, 60, 90 and 180 postinfection in the lung airways (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)), lung interstitium and spleen using intravital labeling, which allows for the identification of extravascular T cells in the tissue by gating on IV \u2212 CD8 + T cells (negative for staining with the intravital antibody). Tissue-resident, FluNP + , memory CD8 + T cells were present in both the lung airways and the interstitium 35 d post-x31 infection ( Fig. 1c) . Regardless of specificity, the number of CD8 + IV \u2212 A-T RM cells and CD8 + IV \u2212 I-T RM cells gradually declined from day 35 to day 180 post-infection, whereas the number of splenic effector, memory CD8 + CD62L \u2212 T cells (S-T EM ) remained mostly unchanged (Fig. 1d,e) . We observed a similar trend after infection with Sendai virus (see Supplementary Fig. 1) , indicating that the effect was not specific to influenza virus. A-T RM cells were lost much more rapidly than I-T RM cells, declining almost 100-fold by 6 months postinfection compared with 40-fold for I-T RM cells (Fig. 1f,g) . These data indicated that A-T RM and I-T RM cells were lost over 6 months post-infection, with a more accelerated decline of the A-T RM cells.",

A-T RM and I-T RM cells had increased annexin V staining compared with S-T EM cells (Fig. 2f,g) , indicating increased apoptosis. We also observed an important increase in AnnexinV + cells among CD69 + A-T RM cells compared with CD69 + I-T RM cells (Fig. 2h) . Thus, the gradual loss of lung T RM cells was due to increased apoptosis within the tissue, and A-T RM cells had a higher rate of cell death compared with I-T RM cells, possibly due to unique microenvironmental effects within the lung on the survival of T RM cells.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 9,362 genes detected indicated that I-T RM cells more closely aligned with S-T EM cells than with A-T RM cells (Fig. 3b ). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, absolute log 2 (fold change) (log 2 (FC)) > 1) indicated that each population had a distinct expression profile, with A-T RM cells being the most transcriptionally distinct (Fig. 3c) . We correlated the change in expression for genes differentially expressed between A-T RM and S-T EM cells, or between A-T RM and I-T RM cells, and identified gene expression changes unique to each comparison (for example, Itgae, Ctla4), as well as shared differences (for example, Klrg1, Asns) (Fig. 3d) . DEGs upregulated in airway T RM cells included genes involved in amino acid transport (Slc1a4, Slc7a5) and amino acid synthesis (Asns, Lars), whereas DEGs shared by A-T RM and I-T RM cells included genes associated with programming of T RM cells (Itga1, Itgae, Ahr) (Fig. 3d) . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 21 identified a notable positive enrichment in genes associated with the unfolded protein response in A-T RM cells compared with both I-T RM and S-T EM cells (Fig. 3e) , suggesting stresses unique to the airway and not present in the lung interstitium or spleen. A-T RM cells were also negatively enriched for genes involved in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pathway, including Prf1, Gzma, Gzmb and Gzmk (Fig. 3e) , which supported previous reports that A-T RM cells are poorly cytolytic 15 . In addition, A-T RM cells showed altered expression of DEGs related to intrinsic cell death, maintenance of cell survival under cell stress and activation of the ISR, including Dusp1, Bax, Bcl2, Bbc3, Pim2 and the proapoptotic transcription factor Ddit3 (Fig. 3f) . However, A-T RM and I-T RM cells shared the expression of a core set of known T RM genes, including Itgae, Cdh1, Ahr, Cxcr6, Klf2 and S1p1r 6, 18 (Fig. 3f) . To confirm the RNA-seq findings, we performed a second analysis using FluNP + CD8 + T cells sorted from three independent cohorts of wild-type mice 35 d after x31 infection, which included FluNP + IV + CD8 + T EM cells from the lung vasculature, in addition to FluNP + A-T RM , I-T RM and S-T EM cells, to address whether processing of the lung tissue impacted the genetic signature of I-T RM cells. Data from this additional analysis showed a similar pattern of gene expression to the original analysis, and indicated that FluNP + I-T RM cells and lung vascular T EM cells had unique transcriptional signatures (see Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In addition, staining for BCL2 protein indicated that BCL2 was notably upregulated in A-T RM cells compared with I-T RM cells (see Supplementary Fig. 4 ). These data indicated that A-T RM cells had a distinct transcriptional profile, characterized by cellular stress and balancing of pro-and antiapoptotic signals compared with I-T RM cells, , and suggested that the local microenvironment had a critical role in regulating T RM cell biology.",

The PCA of 47,683 accessible loci indicated that A-T RM cells clustered separately from I-T RM and S-T EM cells (Fig. 4a ). These differences were not due to tissue processing and were consistent in three independent cohorts of wild-type mice that had been infected with x31 35 d earlier (see Supplementary Fig. 3 ). We identified differentially accessible regions (DARs) (FDR < 0.05, absolute log 2 (FC) > 1) between each T RM cell subset (Fig. 4b) , and integrated them with the RNA-seq data to determine coordinated changes in the epigenome and transcriptome for each T RM cell subset 26 . Using k-means clustering, we observed three distinct patterns (k1-k3) in the data that could be mapped to each of the cell types: k1 in S-T EM cells, k2 in I-T RM cells and k3 in A-T RM cells (Fig. 4c ). This analysis indicated that A-T RM cells had a unique chromatin accessibility landscape compared with I-T RM and S-T EM cells, which resulted in coordinated changes in gene expression and suggested that the epigenetic architecture of A-T RM cells may be impacted by their environment.",

Different stressors activate unique pathways to restore cellular homeostasis 28 . To determine the pathway responsible for the gradual loss of A-T RM cells, we analyzed genes known to be involved in responses to cellular stress that were differentially expressed in A-T RM cells. Most transcripts upregulated in A-T RM cells were involved in amino acid transport (Slc25a22, Slc1a4, Slc7a5), amino acid synthesis (Mars, Lars, Sars, Aars, Asns), recognition of uncharged transfer RNAs (Eif2ak4), cell cycle arrest (Cdkn1a) and proapoptotic transcriptional regulation in response to stress (Ddit3) (Fig. 5a) , suggesting that amino acid starvation could be the primary trigger for activation of the ISR in A-T RM cells 28 . GSEA indicated that gene sets involved in intrinsic apoptotic signaling, in response to ER stress and amino acid transport, were highly enriched in A-T RM cells compared with I-T RM and S-T EM cells (Fig. 5b) , suggesting ISR activation and amino acid starvation in these cells. To further investigate the impact of the airway environment in the amino acid stress response, we assessed the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter CD98, a heterodimer of Slc7a5 and Slc3a2 (ref. 29 ), in combination with CD11a, which is highly expressed on memory CD8 + T cells, but is downregulated within 36 h of entry into the airways 30 , on FluNP + A-T RM , I-T RM and S-T EM cells 35 d post-influenza infection. A-T RM cells expressed more CD98 compared with I-T RM and S-T EM cells (Fig. 5c,d) . Furthermore, increased expression of CD98 on A-T RM cells was limited to CD11a lo cells (Fig. 5d) , indicating that upregulation of CD98 occurred after entry into the airway environment. To address whether the airway environment was sufficient to drive upregulation of CD98 on memory CD8 + T cells, we transferred, intratracheally, S-T EM cells, from wild-type mice infected with x31 30 d earlier, into naive, congenic, wild-type recipient mice. Expression of CD98 on transferred S-T EM cells was notably increased 4 d post-intratracheal (i.t.) transfer compared with S-T EM cells pre-transfer (Fig. 5e ). In addition, expression of CD98 on S-T EM cells transferred into the airways steadily increased between day 1 and day 8 post-i.t. transfer (Fig. 5f) , suggesting that CD98 expression correlated with the length of time that memory CD8 + T cells were in the airway environment.",

Chimeric mice generated by co-injecting wild-type and Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow cells into congenic mice were infected with influenza x31 8 weeks post-transfer. The number of FluNP + A-T RM , I-T RM and S-T EM cells was determined at the peak of acute infection (day 10) and after establishment of T cell memory (day 60). The ratio of wild-type to Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 FluNP + A-T RM and I-T RM cells (normalized to the ratio of wild-type to Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 FluNP + S-T EM cells in each mouse) showed no differences (Fig. 5h) , indicating that Ddit3 deficiency did not rescue the accumulation of FluNP + A-T RM cells. However, the dynamic balance between cell death and cell recruitment that regulates the number of A-T RM cells made it difficult to accurately define whether expression of Ddit3 impacted the survival of memory CD8 + T cells in the airway. Thus, to assess cell survival in the absence of cell recruitment to the airways, we sorted S-T EM cells from the spleens of congenic wild-type CD45.1 + and Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with x31 35 d earlier, and transferred them intratracheally in equal mixes into wild-type CD45.1 + CD45.2 + recipients infected with x31 35 d earlier; 3 d post-transfer, the ratio of wild-type S-T EM cells to Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 S-T EM cells in the airways was notably biased toward Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 S-T EM cells (Fig. 5i) only 54 transcripts were differentially expressed in S-T EM cells postintraperitoneal (i.p.) transfer compared with S-T EM cells pre-transfer (Fig. 6a) . GSEA comparing S-T EM cells post-i.t. or post-i.p. transfer with S-T EM cells pre-transfer indicated an important enrichment for pathways mediating the amino acid starvation response and ER stress in post-i.t. transfer S-T EM cells, but not post-i.p. transfer S-T EM cells (Fig. 6b) 33 . Published datasets from alveolar and lung interstitial macrophages showed no enrichment of genes involved in amino acid starvation or ER stress (see Supplementary Fig. 6 ), indicating that these pathways were enriched in S-T EM cells but not in macrophages exposed to the airway environment.",

The waning of the A-T RM cell pool over time had suggested that the source of these newly recruited cells must also be similarly transient, but whether these cells come predominantly from the circulation or from within the tissue remained unclear. Our parabiosis experiments in mice previously exposed to influenza virus indicated that A-T RM and I-T RM cells were not maintained by recruitment of circulating cells into the lung T RM cell pool, which agrees with recent reports that antigen encounter in the pulmonary environment, and not simply entry into the lung tissue itself, is required for T RM cell differentiation 14, 36, 37 . These data are in contrast to a study showing that circulating T EM cells were able to re-seed the lung T RM cell pool 16 . The observation that lung T RM cells could develop independently of pulmonary antigen encounter under specific inflammatory conditions may explain this discrepancy 38 . Thus, there may be scenarios where circulating T EM cells can convert into lung T RM cells, but further investigation is required to define these antigen-independent mechanisms. Results in animal models of respiratory viral infections indicate that the poor longevity of A-T RM and I-T RM cells would be an impediment to the development of cell-mediated vaccines. However, approaches to maintain lung T RM cells and protective cellular immunity for at least 1 year have been reported 39, 40 . Comparison of primary and quaternary CD8 + T cell memory indicates that lung T RM cells generated by repeated influenza infections are resistant to apoptosis and persist in larger numbers 39 , suggesting that primeboost strategies may improve lung T RM cell survival. In addition, vaccination with replication-defective adenoviruses expressing 4-1BBL sustained lung T RM cells and prolonged heterosubtype immunity 40 . Additional research into the mechanisms behind the longevity of lung T RM cells is needed to inform the design of efficacious cell-mediated vaccine strategies.",

In contrast, the nutrient-poor conditions in the airway during homeostasis may serve as a brake on CTL activity to avoid unnecessary damage to the epithelium. Notably, this nutrient-poor environment does not influence the secretion of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3, which is critical for the protection mediated by A-T RM cells 15 . Therefore, the difference in nutrient availability among distinct microenvironments of the lung may create a division of labor among the lung T RM cell pool, with A-T RM cells serving primarily a 'sensing and alarm' function that could recruit cytolytic I-T RM cells and other immune cells to the site of infection 2 .",

To address whether deletion of Ddit3 impacted cellular immunity, A-T RM cells from wild-type or Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, infected with x31 35 d earlier, were transferred intratracheally into the airways of naive hosts before challenge with PR8 influenza 1 d post-transfer. Viral titers were similar between mice that received wild-type or Ddit3 \u2212/\u2212 A-T RM cells on day 4 post-challenge (see Supplementary Fig. 5) , indicating that expression of Ddit3 did not alter the protective functions of A-T RM cells. Thus, the airway environment affected T RM cell biology and suggested that amino acid starvation contributed to the gradual loss of the A-T RM cells. The airway environment drives activation of the ISR. To provide a causative link between the microenvironment and the transcriptional signature of A-T RM cells, we sorted FluNP + S-T EM cells from wild-type (CD45.2) mice 35 d post-x31 infection, and transferred them intratracheally or intraperitoneally into wild-type CD45.1 mice that had been infected with x31 35 d earlier.
