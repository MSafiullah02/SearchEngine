            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae and the genus Alphacoronavirus (Lin et al., 2016a). The size of PEDV genomic RNA is approximately 28 kb long with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly (A) tail and contains a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), seven open reading frames (ORFs; ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6) encoding viral proteins, and a 3\u2032 UTR (Huang et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016). Among these ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral polymerase; ORF3 encodes a nonstructural protein that is thought to be related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity (Wang et al., 2012). In addition, the other ORFs have specific names according to the proteins encoded in these regions, i.e., spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Jung and Saif, 2015; Song et al., 2015). Of the PEDV structural proteins, the S protein is considered the most antigenic; it is a glycosylated protein located on the envelope of the virus and consists of S1, which is a receptor-binding subunit, and S2, which is a membrane fusion subunit (Gillam et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2017). The S protein is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of PEDV virulence in vivo (Lin et al., 2017; Sato et al., 2011). The M protein is the most abundant component among viral proteins in the envelope and plays an important role in virus assembly by interacting with the S and N proteins (Jung and Saif, 2015; Vennema et al., 1996). The N protein of coronavirus binds RNA and packages viral genomic RNA into the nucleocapsid of viral particles (Spaan et al., 1983).",

            "text": "PED was first reported in pigs in the United Kingdom in 1971, but no PEDV was isolated from this outbreak (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978). In 1978, the PEDV CV777 strain was confirmed as the cause of a PED outbreak that occurred in 1977 in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). During the 1980s and 1990s in Europe, outbreaks of PED occurred infrequently, but the virus continued to spread and persisted in an endemic form in the pig population (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994; Wang et al., 2016). PED was reported for the first time in China in 1973 (Huang et al., 1980), but the pathogen, PEDV, was not identified until 1984 using fluorescent-labeled antibody and serum neutralization (SN) tests (Xuan et al., 1984). Since then, PED outbreaks have occurred infrequently with only sporadic incidents in small regions of China (Li et al., 2012). In October 2010, a highly pathogenic variant PEDV strain was identified in China; this variant caused the worst recorded outbreak and soon swept throughout almost the entire country (Li et al., 2012). Subsequently, this PEDV variant caused a pandemic in the United States (US) starting in the spring of 2013 and then spread to Canada and Mexico (Niederwerder and Hesse, 2018). Severe PED outbreaks have recurred almost simultaneously in many Asian countries, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and Japan, and US prototype-like GII PEDV strains have been found to be accountable for these outbreaks (Cheun-Arom et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2014; Paraguison-Alili and Domingo, 2016; Van Diep et al., 2015). In addition, the US S INDEL-like strains have been described in many European countries, such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Netherlands (Choudhury et al., 2016; Pensaert and Martelli, 2016; Stadler et al., 2015). Therefore, PEDV has currently re-emerged as one of the most devastating viral diseases of swine in the world, resulting in tremendous economic losses to the global pig industry.",

            "text": "Currently, there are many commercially available PEDV vaccines in China derived from classical strains of the virus that are either inactivated/killed or attenuated. However, as demonstrated in clinical studies, even vaccinated pigs are not protected from PEDV infection, so vaccines based on classical strains are insufficiently protective (Chen et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). The incomplete efficacies of the current PEDV vaccines might be ascribed to antigenic or genetic differences between the major S glycoprotein in the vaccine and those in the field epidemic strains. The results of epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalent strains responsible for the previous outbreak in China in late 2010 and those responsible for recent outbreaks Asia and North America belong to the GII genogroup (Wang et al., 2016). Therefore, new PEDV vaccines for swine based on the emerging variant strains are urgently needed. To achieve this objective, the epidemic variant strains should be isolated as soon as possible and their biological characteristics, pathogenicity and immune protective effects as vaccine candidates should also be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, a Chinese virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain, CH/HNPJ/2017 (GenBank accession number: MF152604), was isolated and serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 90 passages. Furthermore, its biological characteristics, pathogenicity and immune protective effects as an inactivated vaccine candidate were clarified and evaluated. This strain could be used as an optimal inactivated or attenuated vaccine candidate for the prevention and control of PEDV in China.",

After three rounds of freezing and thawing, the liquid supernatant containing viruses was collected with centrifugal processes and then inactivated by addition of 0.2 M BEI to a final concentration of 2 mM at 30 \u00b0C for 24 h. After the reaction, the remaining BEI was neutralized by addition of 20% sodium thiosulfate. The effect of inactivation was assessed by the absence of viral growth in Vero cell cultures and inoculation of the piglets. The inactivated vaccines were prepared by mixing BEI-inactivated cell culture-adapted CH/HNPJ/2017 P70 with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma, Germany), according to the instruction manual, and stored at 4 \u00b0C until use.",

However, most importantly, two neighboring unique insertion mutations (12 bp in each, at positions nt 1074-1075 of the parental P0 virus) that resulted in four amino acid changes occurred in the S1 region of passages P10 and P60 (Fig. 4\nA). In addition, these two unique insertion mutations existed only in cell culture-passaged CH/HNPJ/2017 strains but not in all the other strains isolated from China or other countries to date. This may be the result of the virus adapting to the host cell; however, its functions needs to be studied further using reverse genetics in the future.

            "text": "Although PEDV infection did occur in Chinese pig farms from the time of first report in 1973 until October 2010, outbreaks were sporadic and regional, and there were no reports of large-scale outbreaks (Sun et al., 2016). However, a large-scale outbreak clinically characterized by acute diarrhea and a high mortality rate of 80\u2013100% among piglets occurred in the southern provinces in October 2010 and soon swept throughout the country, causing enormous economic losses (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013). Currently, PED outbreaks in China are caused by field epidemic G2 variant strains that differ genetically from the classical PEDV strain, CV777 (Lee, 2015). Although PEDV vaccines based on the classical PEDV strain CV777, such as the inactivated, bivalent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PEDV vaccine (1999 to present) and the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (2003\u20132006), have been widely used in the Chinese pig population, PED outbreaks have still occurred in vaccinated herds with a high mortality rate in neonatal piglets, indicating that vaccines derived from classical strains cannot provide adequate immune protection against the currently prevalent strains (GII genogroup) (Ayudhya et al., 2012). This failure of protection may be caused by dramatic mutation of the virus, which poses a major challenge for the prevention and control of PED in China (Wang et al., 2016). In addition to molecular evidence, antigenic variations between classical and emerging highly virulent (non-S INDEL) PEDV strains were demonstrated in several serological cross reactivity assays (Kim et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015a, 2015b; Wang et al., 2015). There are also some studies showed that the highly virulent (non-S INDEL) PEDV strains could provide piglets against homologous challenge (Baek et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2016b ; Park et al., 2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need for more research aimed at understanding the biological characteristics, pathogenicity, and immune protective effects of the field prevalent strain in the GII genogroup. For this purpose, the epidemic variant strain CH/HNPJ/2017 (GenBank accession number: MF152604) belonging to the GIIb genogroup was isolated in Vero cells and its biological characteristics were ascertained in the present study. The CH/HNPJ/2017 strain was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to the 90 passages. We are currently continuing serial passages of the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain in an effort to develop a live attenuated PEDV vaccine that exerts better protective effects than the currently available vaccines against GII epidemic PEDV in China.",

Experimental infection with highly virulent PEDV strains in different types of pigs resulted in consistent outcomes and conclusions (Chen et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2016a; Liu et al., 2015; Madson et al., 2016, 2014; Thomas et al., 2015). In this study, the infectious titer and virulence of the fourth passage of the cell culture-adapted CH/HNPJ/2017 strain (104.29 TCID50/mL) was determined by using 4-day-old conventional suckling pigs. At 72 PIH, viral RNA fecal shedding identified in rectal swab samples or samples of intestinal content became positive in G1\u2013G4 piglets (10\u22125\u201310\u22128 diluted virus), with CT values ranging from 17.30 to 25.96 (Table 1). The PDD50 was determined to be 7.68 log10PDD50/3 mL, and it similar to that of the US highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain (7.83 log10PDD50/3 mL, 24 PIH), indicating that the Chinese PEDV CH/HNPJ/2017 strain is highly virulent as well. In addition, highly virulent PEDV strains can induce severe villous atrophy (Lin et al., 2016a). Similar pathological findings were also presented in the intestinal tissues of piglets infected with the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain. On histopathological examination, viral enteritis was present in all diarrheal piglets, as evidenced by vacuolation of the small intestinal enterocytes and shortening, fusion and sloughing of the small intestinal villi (Fig. 5D, E).",

However, pregnant sows usually cannot be used in vaccination experiments because of breeding conditions and because experiment numbers and experimental expenditure are limited. Therefore, in this study, we used piglets to evaluate the protective efficacy of our experimental inactivated vaccine because pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV infection (Lee et al., 2018). The detection of serum antibodies showed that the experimental inactivated vaccine induced significant PEDV-specific serum IgG and neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV compared with mock control at 7, 14 and 21 dpv (P < 0.05, Fig. 6), indicating that the experimental inactivated vaccine had better immunogenicity and could induce a stronger PEDV-specific antibody response than the commercial inactivated vaccine in pigs. Furthermore, the challenge study showed that the experimental inactivated vaccine could protect 60% (3/5) of pigs against 100 TCID50 of cell culture-adapted CH/HNPJ/2017 P4 challenge. The protective efficacy of the experimental inactivated vaccine was better than that of the commercial inactivated vaccine, indicating that the experimental inactivated vaccine could be used as a good vaccine candidate in future clinical practice. Maternally derived lactogenic immunity (IgG and IgA) plays an important role in protecting neonatal piglets against PEDV infection (Song et al., 2015). Therefore, to achieve this goal, sow vaccination and challenge experiments will be carried out to evaluate the protective efficacy of the vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV and to assess any safety concerns for use in neonatal piglets in our future studies.",

The CH/HNPJ/2017 strain has good cellular adaptation to Vero cells and is highly virulent in piglets. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the PDD50 of a Chinese PEDV strain, and the results will be very helpful for future pig infection experiments. In addition, the CH/HNPJ/2017 strain had better immune protective effects as an inactivated vaccine candidate than the commercially available vaccine. The results of this study are important for understanding the characteristics of Chinese PEDV and for the development of novel effective vaccines against PED in China.",
