Newspapers commented on patent cases and, quite often, portrayed patents as a negative story (Caulfield et al. 2006 (Caulfield et al. , 2007 . The commotion surrounding the current patent framework for genetic testing is hardly surprising. Although patents on human genes and diagnostics are not novel, patents on genes for diagnostics are indeed a rather special combination. And although licensing has become daily routine in genetics to gain access to patented technology, the emergence of patent clusters and the restrictive licensing behaviour of some patent proprietors has been experienced as quite disturbing.",

As a matter of routine, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted EUROPEAN PATENTS for DNA sequences and genes without a great stir, provided they met the conditions of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. This lenient policy was first formally challenged when a patent was granted for \"a DNA fragment encoding human H2-preprorelaxin\" (see claim 1 of European patent EP 112.149). In its decision, the EPO concluded that an invention concerning a human gene was not an exception to patentability because it would not be universally regarded as outrageous: \"[. . . ] it did not amount to patenting life because DNA as such was not life but one of the many chemical entities participating in biological processes; no offence to human dignity had occurred as the woman who donated tissue was asked for her consent and her self-determination was not affected by the exploitation of the claimed molecules\" (EPO OD, 1995, Howard Florey Institute) .",

The question then arose to what extent this new rule was in conformity with the exclusion of inventions the exploitation of which would be contrary to ordre public or morality (article 53 (a) EPC) (See Box 2). Based on earlier case law (EPO EBoA G1/98, 1999, Novartis AG) , the EPO adopted the view that the new rule \"only gave a more detailed interpretation of the meaning of article 53 EPC as intended from its inception\". It thus followed from the text of the rule itself that genes were not to be considered as an exception from patentability on grounds of ordre public or morality (EPO TBoA T272/95, 2002, Howard Florey Institute).",

The EPO jurisdictions initially clarified that only diagnostic methods claiming all steps involved in reaching a medical diagnosis (viz. examination, recording any significant deviation from the normal value, attributing that deviation to a particular clinical picture) were excluded from patentability and thus not patentable.

All that was needed to justify an exclusion was that the claimed method comprised one step which served diagnostic purposes or related to diagnosis and was to be regarded as an essential activity pertaining to diagnosis and practised on the living human body. This U-turn in the EPO position was motivated by the fact that early case law amounted to setting a different standard for diagnostic methods compared to methods of surgery or therapy, the latter being excluded from patent protection if they comprised only one single step of a surgical or therapeutic nature. It was further held that the criterion \"practised on the body\" was in any case satisfied if direct contact with the body was involved.

Furthermore, the exemption is directed to \"research\" and it remains unclear to what extent said exemption can shield diagnostic testing. On the one hand, it can be argued that diagnostic testing falls within the research exemption, because patient blood or tissue sampling is often necessary to do research. On the other hand, it can be claimed that diagnostic testing can not fall within the exemption because once a diagnostic test is established, the act of diagnosis could be defined as and/or confined to the act of providing the referring medical doctor with an opinion as to whether or not the patient carries a deleterious mutation. Recent EPO case law seems to opt for this last viewpoint (EPO EBoA G1/04, 2005, Diagnostic methods).",

Roughly speaking, three licensing approaches can be distinguished in the diagnostic field (Matthijs 2007 ). In the first or so-called \"open\" model, put to practice with the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, free access is granted to gene sequences for diagnostic testing using commonly available technologies for mutation analysis, but royalties are collected on gene based commercial test kits. In the second or so-called \"monopoly\" model, witnessed in the BRCA gene case, an exclusive licensing policy is applied with relatively high prices (see below). In the third model, operationalised with the Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) gene, the company offers to license laboratories to carry out testing, but at a cost that makes the company's own, commercial test kit more economically attractive owing to their requirement of up-front payments and a per-test fee.",

Most prominent in this regard are the newly introduced license schemes of Belgium and France (Van Overwalle 2006) . Such compulsory license schemes allow others than the patent holder to exploit an invention protected by a patent for (a) a medication, a medical appliance, a medical appliance or product for diagnosis, a derived or combinable therapeutic product, (b) the process or product necessary for the manufacture of one or more products indicated under (a) and (c) a diagnostic method applied outside of the human or animal body.",

One of the most frequently used techniques to test for BRCA is PCR. The original Mullis patent expired a few years ago, but other patents still protect various aspects of the method (see Box 6). An alternative technique which can be put to work to test for breast and ovarian cancer is Multiplex ligation-dependent amplification method (MLPA), which has been protected by various patents in the US (patents are pending in Europe) (see Box 7).

The impasses identified and the criticism voiced is not always directed to the existence of the patent system as such, but rather to some excesses in the exercise of patent rights and the unrestrained behaviour of individual patent owners, in an effort to maximize profit.",

It is also to be expected that new models of collaborative licensing may contribute to facilitating access to genetic testing when clusters of patents are rendering access to genetic testing technology too complex and uncertain Huys et al., 2009. Lexicon EUROPEAN PATENT. On the basis of a single application and examination procedure one can protect an invention in up to 36 European countries, all contracting states which have ratified the European Patent Convention of 1973 (EPC). The term \"European patent\", however, is misleading from three points of view. It is not a single patent that is valid for the whole of Europe: the application and granting procedures are uniform, after which the patent is broken up into a \"bundle\" of national patents which are further subject to national legislation and, more particularly, to national regulations with regard to nullification and impairment. Nor is a \"European patent\" a patent granted by the European Union (EU): European patents have nothing to do with the EU apart from the fact that all EU Member States have also signed the EPC. Furthermore, it is on the basis of the EPC that the European Patent Office (EPO) was brought into being, for dealing with European patent applications. It bears repeating that the EPO is not an EU institution, either. NATIONAL PATENT. In Europe it is also possible to obtain patent protection by separate application to each of the national patent offices within Europe.",
