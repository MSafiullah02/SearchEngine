The researchers in the ALSPAC study groups have already been meritorious in perinatal psychiatric research-eg, in examining how maternal perinatal anxiety and depression might be associated with offspring depression. 8 The relationship between maternal antenatal depressed mood and offspring psychotic continuum has been previously studied in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966, 6 and the current study adds valuable knowledge to these studies.",

However, many studies included in the review used rigorous methods of randomisation and allocation concealment without detailing these in print. 2 Moreover, most mentioned studies were psychosocial or psychotherapy trials, in which it is impossible to implement masking of therapists and notoriously difficult to maintain patient masking. High attrition is also common in all trials involving youth with mental disorders.",
