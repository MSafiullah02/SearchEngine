According to this \"Pushing Through\" model of resilience, there are three phases that exemplify how resilience is experienced: first, 'stepping into', or embracing, the adversity. Second, 'staying the course', or being aware they must continue pursuing their goals. Last, 'acknowledging' that they have learned from their adversity and felt ready to meet another challenge. Students also experienced temporary setbacks such as 'disengaging' from school because they felt overwhelmed. This model acts as a lens to explain how resilience can be fostered over time despite periods of adversity. Given evidence that resilience is related to burnout in nursing students (R\u00edos-Risquez et al. 2016) , there is preliminary support for promoting resilience in nursing students before they enter their careers.",

Interventions aimed at fostering resilience have been identified as important for both employee and organizational wellbeing (see Robertson, Cooper, Sarkar, & Curran, 2015 for review). Thus, resilience interventions could be especially valuable for young nurses who are less likely to use positive coping strategies (McGarry et al. 2013) and are higher risk for poor retention (Clendon and Walker 2012) . This is especially valuable because nursing is predicted to experience high job growth in the U.S. by 2026 (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017), though there will be a worldwide nurse shortage through 2025 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014).",

            "text": "Week 1 was an introduction to resilience and promoting positive emotions. According to the Broaden and Build theory of positive psychology, positive emotions act as a resource to mitigate the negative effects of stress (Fredrickson and Joiner 2002) . These positive emotions act as a precursor to resilience (Ong et al. 2006) . Time management and communication were identified by the nursing faculty as critical needs (Altmiller 2011; Hershcovis 2011; Heslop et al. 2001; Pines et al. 2014 ). In Week 2, a specialist in academic success learning strategies presented on time management. Week 3 was a session on individual strengths to provide a well-rounded framework for resilience, rather than just focusing on the negative (Lester et al. 2011; Rath 2007) . In Week 4, a licensed independent mental health practitioner presented on conflict management through effective communication. Given the high prevalence of burnout in nursing students (Gibbons 2010) , Week 5 educated about identifying and mitigating burnout symptoms through peer support (Mathieu 2012) . Immediately following the intervention, both groups completed the Time 2 (T2) survey in March 2017; intervention participants also completed the satisfaction measure. In June 2017, both groups completed the Time 3 (T3) survey. For every completed survey, participants were compensated with a $10 Amazon gift card. Intervention participants also received the StrengthsFinder 2.0 book (Rath 2007), a gratitude journal to use throughout the intervention, and a bonus $20 Amazon gift card if they attended all five intervention sessions (N = 9; 64%).",

The fact that exhaustion only declined in the intervention group indicates that other factors (e.g., learning how to cope with nursing school, exams, time of year) did not influence the participants otherwise both groups would have reported a decline in exhaustion. The intervention had no effect on cynicism, and a negative effect on professional efficacy. This has important implications for future resilience interventions. With its heavy focus on stressful scenarios that may arise throughout their careers (e.g., conflict with coworkers, patient deaths), it is possible that this intervention simply made participants more aware of their own ability to cope with stressful situations, thereby decreasing their perceived professional efficacy. However, resilience interventions appear to be effective at reducing exhaustion in the short-term. At the three-month follow-up, there were no significant changes in resilience or burnout, suggesting that maintenance may be important for these interventions (Padesky and Mooney 2012) .",

This doesn't mean that occupational resilience interventions should take a standardized approach, however. The type of adversity that nursing students face is different from pediatric nurses, psychiatric nurses, police officers, construction workers, and astronauts. Thus, there is both risk and opportunity for practitioners and researchers wishing to develop interventions.

Further, similar interventions have been conducted with smaller sample sizes and without a control group (Potter et al. 2013; van der Riet et al. 2015) . This study is therefore a unique contribution to the literature. Participants were recruited voluntarily, and it is possible that those who were interested in a resilience intervention were more burnt out than those who did not participate. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups, which is one method of avoiding selection effects within experiments (i.e., both groups were equally resilient and burned out before the intervention). Further, there was only a 47% participation rate in this study. Previous research has found that response rates range from 35.7% -52.7% depending on the sample (Baruch and Holtom 2008) . However, this study provided advance notice and monetary compensation, both of which are effective ways to recruit participants and reduce attrition (Anseel et al. 2010; Robinson et al. 2015) .

Because participants reported wanting more hands-on activities, future resilience interventions should consider incorporating adversity (Clohessy et al. 2019) . Providing nursing students with exposure to realistic scenarios in a simulation allows them to effectively practice their skills (Aebersold and Tschannen 2013; Robertson et al. 2015) . For example participants could act out a scenario where a coworker is rude to them, and practice an appropriate response. Furthermore, outcomes like patient satisfaction (Kim et al. 2004 ) and patient outcomes should be explored. At an individual level, promoting resilience may produce better patient outcomes. Incorporating positive coping strategies and other resilience techniques may improve patient handoffs (Drach-Zahavy et al. 2015) .",
