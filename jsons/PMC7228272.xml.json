This infectious disease was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). It rapidly spreads throughout the world. More than 80 000 cases have been reported in China and epidemics have grown in other countries.\n1\n However, minimal information is available regarding COVID\u201019 patients with haemophilia A. Herein, we retrospectively analysed the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, treatment and clinical outcomes of an infected patient with haemophilia A in Wuhan. This case report may be a good example for the management of mild COVID\u201019 cases with haemophilia A.",

The next day (20 January 2020), he felt fatigue and presented with repeated low\u2010grade fever with chills, recurrent vomiting and anorexia. The patient suspected that he might have infections with some bacteria, so he took oral amoxicillin and Chinese traditional medicines for 2 days on his own. However, his symptoms did not improve substantially. He disclosed that his mother developed fever and dry cough prior to his onset of symptoms and her condition had continued to worsen. The other family members also developed fever later except for his 3\u2010year\u2010old son. He decided to seek medical treatment because of suspicion of COVID\u201019.",

Given the history of his household members with fever or history of fever, he was triaged to a fever clinic exclusively for patients with suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. After waiting for approximately 5 hours, he was placed in a dedicated consultation room and underwent an examination by a physician. According to the records of physical examination, the vital sign of the patient revealed a body temperature of 38.2\u00b0C, pulse of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 108/82 mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 96% breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were normal to auscultation. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and the CT images revealed ground glass opacities located in the right lower lobe of his lung. The laboratory results showed normal values of neutrophil count (2.52 \u00d7 109/L), monocyte count (0.23 \u00d7 109/L), haemoglobin (137 g/L) and platelet count (214 \u00d7 109/L), but leukopenia (white blood cell count, 3.64 \u00d7 109/L), lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.85 \u00d7 109/L), elevated plasma C\u2010reactive protein (CRP, 12.6 mg/L) and serum amyloid A (SAA, 37 mg/L). Oropharyngeal swab samples were negative for influenza A and B viral antigens. Nucleic acid detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was reported later as positive using his oropharyngeal swab by real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). At this time point, dyspnoea developed while he increased his physical activity. However, the patient was not admitted to the hospital because of limited wards where only critically ill cases were allowed. Uncomplicated COVID\u201019 patients are managed as outpatients.",

He further received oral administration of antiviral agents (oseltamivir), empiric antibiotic (cefdinir) and Chinese traditional medicines (Lianhua Qingwen capsules) for 6 days at home. On the 3rd day of treatment (day 7 of illness, 25 January 2020), the patient's appetite remarkably improved and other encountered symptoms resolved, including myalgia, vomiting and chills. On the 5th day of treatment (day 9 of illness, 27 January 2020), his body temperature returned to normal, but he reported that dry cough remained unchanged and chest pain developed in his right lung when breathing deeply. Dry cough, dyspnoea and chest pain alleviated gradually and vanished 2 weeks later. This patient never reported any hemoptysis. As of 10 March 2020, this case was asymptomatic and bleeding events did not increase more than usual during the follow\u2010up period.",

Adults of middle age and older are most likely to be affected while symptomatic infection in children appears to be relatively uncommon.\n3\n Clinical features of this family conformed to the above characteristics. The most common features at the onset of COVID\u201019 were fever, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, dry cough and dyspnoea. Pneumonia appeared to be the most frequent manifestation of infection, characterized by different degrees of lung involvement on chest imaging.\n4\n Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were relatively uncommon.\n5\n In terms of laboratory results of infection, lymphopenia appeared to be most common, although the white blood cell count could vary.\n6\n Some inflammatory markers were affected by complicated factors. Moreover, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was associated with coagulation activation with prolonged prothrombin time.\n7\n Oropharyngeal swab was suitable as samples for patients with haemophilia A rather than nasal swabs.

According to the product information for oseltamivir and cefdinir, adverse events of bleeding are not described. It seems that his haemophilia may not impact his ability to receive antimicrobial treatment. Haemophilia affects individuals lifelong. In patients with haemophilia with bleeding or suspected bleeding, the immediate goal is to raise the factor activity to a level sufficient to achieve haemostasis.\n8\n They do know when they have to receive administration of replacement factor. Moreover, when other health risks emerge, early replacement therapy is often thought to be beneficial. In China, many have access to potent prescription drugs at home, resulting in a different regime at home than in the hospital. For example, as for discomfort with myalgia in limbs at the onset of COVID\u201019 in this case, it would be more likely the occurrence of bleeding events because of the underlying bleeding disorder rather than infection of unknown cause. This case may benefit from the administration of FVIII at the onset of COVID\u201019 that results in zero bleeding events. Moreover, home management with active monitoring is appropriate for mild infected cases with haemophilia when they are adequately isolated at home. Importantly, if clinical conditions deteriorate, the patient should promptly be hospitalized.",

Mild infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may not increase the occurrence of bleeding events in haemophilic cases. And such cases may benefit from administration of replacement factors at the onset of COVID\u201019.
