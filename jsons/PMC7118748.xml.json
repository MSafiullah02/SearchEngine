Documented hospital outbreaks of SARS occurred in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam and highlighted the weak infection control (IC) infrastructure present in healthcare facilities in resource rich and resource poor areas.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 The morbidity and mortality seen in HCWs as a result of SARS focused attention on IC practices, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the role of education and training in the prevention of SARS. Indeed, one of the major lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak was that IC practices and programmes need strengthening globally.",

This was reinforced with the reporting of \u2018super-spreading events\u2019.1, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15 The concept of super-spreading events has been proposed to explain incidents where a SARS patient infects many more persons than would be expected. Such events contributed to large-scale nosocomial outbreaks and have been attributed to the lack of stringent IC measures in hospitals. However, this does not fully explain these events and further research is required to understand the underlying risk factors. Aerosol-generating procedures have been associated with increased risk of transmission through the aerosolisation of virus-containing particles.16 In addition patients with unrecognised SARS, particularly those with atypical presentations were the source of a number of nosocomial outbreaks.13, 15\n",

In contrast, a retrospective study reported that 70% (72/102) of HCWs in the United States who cared for SARS patients did not use eye protection.32 Furthermore, no documented transmission of SARS-CoV was reported, even among those who had been within 3 feet of a confirmed case.",

Indeed, in many of the areas with a large number of SARS cases several different measures were implemented in order to do this. These included the rapid identification and isolation of possible SARS patients waiting in Emergency Departments; isolating potential SARS patients either individually or in cohorts; designating lifts for use by potential SARS cases only; and, using anterooms for the donning and removal of PPE.3, 7, 22, 23\n",

Functions of the hospital ICC should include outbreak investigation, surveillance, reviewing local epidemiological data, educating staff, patients and visitors, developing and promoting local guidelines and estimating resource needs.
