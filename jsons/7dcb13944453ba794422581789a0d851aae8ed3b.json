Recently, based on a randomized trial [2] , angiotensin II (ANGII) was FDA-and EMA-approved for catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. ANGII use as primary vasopressor for vasodilatory shock has never been reported, let alone for COVID-19associated vasodilatory shock. ANGII may be logical in this setting. It specifically assists patients recently exposed to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [2, 3] and increases the internalization and downregulation of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 [4] , the receptor for COVID-19. Its use may also inform the debate about the risks and benefits of angiotensin receptor blockers in COVID-19-infected patients [5] . In this pilot compassionate-use case series, we used ANGII either as primary or rescue vasopressor in ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated vasodilatory shock and assessed the course of key physiological variables during the first 48 h of treatment.",

Data are median and quartile 25% to quartile 75%. The changes in the parameters over time were assessed with a mixed-effect quantile model based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (\u03c4 = 0.50, a median regression), taking into account repeated measurements and considering the time of measurements (as a continuous variable) as fixed effect. The p value in the graphs represents the changes over this time. In all models, only values at and after the start of the infusion drug were taken into account, and the values before the start were used only for graphic purpose. All results were confirmed after bootstrapping with 10,000 replications. All analyses were conducted in R (R Foundation), version 3.6.3",
