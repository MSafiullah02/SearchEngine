There has been a great surge in demand for hand sanitisation products leading to shortages in their supply. A consequent increase of substandard products in the market has raised safety concerns. This article, therefore, presents a critical review of hand sanitation approaches and products available on the market in light of the scientific evidence available to date. This review also provides a range of hand sanitisation product formulations, and manufacturing instructions to allow for extemporaneous preparations at the community and hospital pharmacies during this urgent crisis. In addition, this emergent situation is expected to continue, hence hand sanitisers will be in demand for an extended time, and the availability and purchase of substandard products on the market create an ongoing safety concern. Therefore, this article shall also provide various commercial organisations, interested in stepping forward the production and marketing of hand sanitisers, with a guide on the development of products of standardised ingredients and formulations.",

CoViD-19 has then rapidly spread around the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 14th April 2020, around two million people have contracted the disease, and over 125 thousand deaths have been attributed to CoViD-19 globally (CSSE, 2020) . The outbreak has triggered the so-called \"pandemic pantries\", a term that well defines the spikes in stockpiling of emergency supplies all around the world. Among these supplies, stocks of hand sanitisers have rapidly vanished from some markets, as soon as the frequent handwashing and sanitisation was recommended by the public health agencies across the world. According to a market research from Nielsen, the sale of hand sanitisers skyrocketed by 300% and 470% in the last week of February and first week of March 2020, respectively, in comparison to the same time in the previous year (Huddleston, 2020) . Similarly, in Italy -one of the most affected countries by CoViD-19 -sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets augmented by 561% during the first three weeks of the pandemic (24th February-15th March 2020) compared to the previous year (Ufficio Studi Coop, 2020) . There have been reports across the world that supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as hospitals and other healthcare facilities, have been running out of hand sanitisers.",

            "text": "A search in Google Trends enables to understand the magnitude of the emergent interest of the general public in hand sanitisers. Google Trends analyse and compare the search volume of given keywords on Google. Fig. 1A shows the trend of the search of the keyword \"hand sanitizer\" (American English spelling) within the United States. A fairly constant volume of Google searches on this topic was shown until February 2020, when a massive spike of 100-fold increase in interest in \"hand sanitizer\" appeared. This finding correlated with the increased search of the word \"CoViD-19\", hinting the obvious relationship between the two terms. To put these numbers into context, comparison between the search on \"hand sanitizer\" to that of the words \"pill\", \"drug\" and \"medicine\" was done in Fig. 1B . Results show that before the spread of the new coronavirus, these words were constantly googled 25-50 times more frequently than \"hand sanitizers\", while during the peak of the pandemic (March 2020), \"hand sanitizers\" was searched approximately twice as much as those keywords. Although, the astonishing peak of searches on \"hand sanitizer\" is moderately tapering down, it is expected that the interest in this topic will remain much higher than the pre-pandemic levels, because, until a vaccine against CoViD-19 will be made available, hand sanitisation will remain at the forefront of infection prevention measures. Moreover, it is reasonable to speculate that the current awareness of the general public of the importance of hand disinfection will remain assimilated and will become an integral part of people's hygiene practices, even post-CoViD-19 era.",

As academics and pharmacists working in pharmaceutical technology departments of schools of pharmacy, we have received a high number of requests related to hand sanitisers, spanning from other faculties and businesses requesting the production of hand sanitisers in our laboratories, to pharmacists asking for advice on the compounding of such products. Indeed, hand sanitisers can also be prepared extemporaneously in pharmacies; however, pharmacists need an appropriate formulation and manufacturing directions to ensure a consistent product with adequate quality. Consumer habits and patterns are rapidly reshaping under the CoViD-19 crisis (McKenzie, 2020) and the unprecedented demand of hand sanitisers is likely to remain as the \"new normal\" for an extended period of time. We, therefore, aim to provide in this article a technical perspective on the functionality and development of alcohol-based hand sanitiser formulations.",

Such preparations may contain one or more types of alcohol, other active ingredients with excipients, and humectants\" (Gold and Avva, 2020). Non-alcoholic products are also available, but they are less preferred by the health organisations (Kampf and Kramer, 2004; Todd et al., 2010) -including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -for fighting CoViD-19 (Howes, 2020) . This is due to their poorer efficacy and narrower spectrum compared to the alcohol-based sanitisation products (CDC, 2019a) . The most important factor in determining the efficacy of a hand sanitiser is indeed the alcoholic content. Nevertheless, there have been worrying reports of alcohol-free hand rubs being constantly sold during the CoViD-19 outbreak (Allen, Marshall Song, 2020) . Consumers must become aware that such alcohol-free products are not recommended by the health organisations and should therefore be avoided.",

For the general public, the CDC suggests washing the hands with soap and water, rather than to use the ABHR, whenever possible. This is because hand washing can virtually remove all types of pathogens, while the hand sanitiser can effectively kill 99.9% of germs (e.g. less effective with Cryptosporidium, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile). Moreover, in case of extremely greasy or dirty hands, ABHR effectiveness is reduced due to poor penetration of the product through the layer of dirt in soiled hands. In contrast, the detergents in a hand wash enable deeper cleaning and higher removal of germs. Moreover, potentially harmful substances can only be washed by a soap and water rather than hand sanitisation using ABHRs. However, handwashing facilities are not readily available at work or public places. Moreover, in instances where hand sensitisation is needed more frequently, such as during frequent contact with individuals or products, the ABHRs are the most effective and convenient infection preventive measure (CDC, 2019a; Hadaway, 2020) . It is however important to emphasise that ABHRs only work when used correctly. Thus, considering that not all ABHR formulations are the same, appropriate labelling is important in directing the correct dose/amount needed to achieve an adequate sanitisation (Hadaway, 2020) . The choice of container, closure and dispenser is also vital in dispensing the correct amount of the sanitiser on each use.",

None of these alcohols is effective against bacterial spores (Weber et al., 2003) . When used at the same concentration, ethanol seems to have a lower bactericidal activity than propanols (Suchomel and Rotter, 2011) . However, ethanol has superior viricidal activity than propanols against non-enveloped viruses (Kampf, 2018a) . Also, skin tolerance is better with ethanol compared to n-propanol or isopropanol (Cartner et al., 2017; Houben et al., 2006) , thus ethanol is often the alcohol of choice in the ABHR preparations (Suchomel and Rotter, 2011; Tarka et al., 2019) .",

Interestingly, Edmonds et al. suggested that the antimicrobial activity of the ABHRs is highly dependent on the choice of formulation (i.e., excipient) rather than on the concentration of alcohol. They also suggested that the liquid, gel and foam-based products can all be equally effective if the ethanol content used was within the 60-95% standard range (Edmonds et al., 2012) . However, increasing ethanolic concentrations of hand rubs from 80% to 85% (v/v) can reduce the contact time necessary to achieve an efficient bactericidal activity (Suchomel et al., 2012; Eggerstedt, 2013; Wilkinson et al., 2017) . Despite this, the WHO, US FDA and CDC still maintain their recommendations of 60-95% ethanol content in ABHRs. An analysis of some currently marketed products (discussed later in section 5) reveals indeed that ABHRs, sold in Italian pharmacies as biocides, contain percentages of ethanol between 62% and 74% (w/w)/(70% to 80% v/v). This goes in line with the standard WHO, US FDA and CDC guidelines (Boyce et al., 2009; CDC, 2019a; FDA, 2020 FDA, , 1994 . It is worth highlighting that ethanol, unlike water, has a density < 1 g/cm 3 , which means that percentages of ethanol in water by weight (w/w) and by volume (v/v) can be significantly different and must be specified on the label. A useful comparison between percentages by weight and by volume of ethanol in ABHRs is reported in a recently published document (BDC, 2020) . Although this concept might seem trivial, there are cases of published works, where the concentration expression (either w/w or v/ v) was not specified, as indicated by Kampf (Kampf, 2018) , ultimately presenting ambiguous information. In research work, compounding and manufacturing, it is recommended to clearly specify the concentration units of alcohol used in ABHRs.",

In a recent article, Jansen has examined the evidence on disinfectants efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (Jansen, 2020) . It was noted that definitive claims on the effectivity of various disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 cannot be made, simply because this is a new virus and the range of off-the-shelf ABHRs has never been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Like other respiratory viruses, the new coronavirus is known to spread mainly from person-to-person through airborne droplets (CDC, 2020) . Moreover, the information about the virus survival on surfaces and the environment is still limited (Jansen, 2020) . It has, however, been indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through surfaces, as it can survive for a long period of time on various materials; for instance, the virus remains stable on plastic and stainless steel for 2-3 days (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . This implies that anyone touching infected surfaces can potentially contact and spread the virus (Jansen, 2020) . It is in this context that hand disinfection becomes highly crucial.",

It has been argued that rubbing time is significantly affected by various other factors such as the dose of the sanitiser, the hand size (application surface area), and the formulation itself. Wilkinson et al. (2017) reported that drying time was strongly associated with the dose and hand surface area. The evaporation rates of alcoholic ingredients may vary in gel and liquid-based sanitisers and may directly correlate to the time when hands start to feel dry after application. This can, therefore, directly influence healthcare professionals' perception of the sufficient rubbing time (Kenters et al., 2020) .",

An adequate training on hand hygiene and sanitisation amid infection control within health care facilities, is, therefore, a key to ensure that a correct dose and technique are always used.

Thus, liquid formulations can leave suboptimal doses of disinfectants on the hands, potentially leading to decrease in product efficacy (Greenaway et al., 2018) . For the consumer market, gel formulations are more portable and convenient to dispense on-the-go due to their ease of use and low risk of spillage compared to liquid-based products. Gel-based formulations also reduce the evaporation rate of alcohol and help alcohol to spread and penetrate through contaminating organisms (Fu et al., 2020; Howes, 2020) . Gels can be obtained by incorporating viscosity enhancer excipients in the formulation. A huge variety of thickening agents for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry are available. Although the performance of these substances is well characterised in aqueous media, little is known about their behaviour in hydroalcoholic solvents.",

All the other alcoholic gels containing carbomer had a characteristic plastic behaviour (refer to Table 1 for the yield stress values) with a strong shear rate dependency (power law index < 0.5 in Table 1 ). All the carbomer-thickened gels showed almost superimposable viscosity profiles except for \"Apoteke T'igienizzo\" and \"Steriman Gel\", which were characterised by a lower consistency. Finally, the only product containing HPMC showed the typical behaviour of a weak gel, characterised by pseudo-plasticity and a moderate shear rate dependency (power law index almost double compared to carbomer gel, but still much lower than 1). Interestingly, the HPMCbased gel exhibited a viscosity similar to that of the carbomer-based gels at the higher shear rates. Overall, the unique and stronger shear rate dependency of carbomer-based products means that, compared to other gels, they are more solid-like on standing and become more liquid-like under agitation (shear-thinning). This dual behaviour is a desirable feature for hand rubs, as the carbomer gel will have an attractive robust consistency, a nice appearance and could still be dispensed in consistent doses -not being runny. Then, during application, the viscosity would decrease drastically under the high shear of the hand rubbing action, which will help in well spreading of the product over the surface area.",

These polymers are effective thickeners, suspending agents and stabilisers at a very low concentration (0.1-3% w/w). Carbomers differ by the cross-linker and its density, and the solvent used during their polymerisation. Based on the cross-linker type, carbomers can be grouped into carbomer homopolymers (acrylic acid crosslinked with allyl sucrose or allyl pentaerythritol), carbomer copolymers (acrylic acid and C10-C30 alkyl acrylate crosslinked with allyl pentaerythritol), and carbomer interpolymers (carbomer homopolymer or copolymer that contains a block copolymer of polyethylene glycol and a long chain alkyl acid ester). For each category, the cross-linking density can be low, medium, or high, providing polymers with a varying ability to increase the viscosity of aqueous systems. The \"traditional\" carbomers are still synthesised in benzene, a toxic solvent that cannot be used for pharmaceutical applications. The pharmaceutical-grade carbomers are synthesised in either ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane. For an unambiguous designation of these copolymers, numeric codes such as 910, 934, 940, 941 are used as the suffix within the carbomer nomenclature to provide an indication of their molecular weight and specific components of the polymer (Lubrizol, 2005) .",

When carbomers are used for thickening of ethanol, isopropanol or hydroalcoholic mixtures (like in hand sanitisers), the neutraliser must be selected carefully to avoid the precipitation of the polymer.

It is prepared by the reaction of ethylene oxide with cellulose in the presence of sodium hydroxide under controlled conditions. Each glucose unit of the cellulose backbone contains three hydroxyl groups capable of reaction. If all three hydroxyl groups of each glucose residue react, the theoretical degree of substitution (DS) would be 3, although this is not practically achievable. The introduced hydroxyethyl groups can, indeed, react again with the free ethylene oxide at basic conditions, giving a side chain containing a different number of hydroxyethyl groups. To account for this, the total molar substitution (MS) describes the average number of ethylene oxide molecules attached to each glucose residue. HEC with DS and MS of 1.5 and 2.5 respectively, is known as Natrosol\u2122 250. Natrosol\u2122 250 is available in a range of molecular weight grades (L, M, H, HH) differing in their aqueous viscosity, where the L, M, H, HH refers to low, medium, high and very high viscosity, respectively. Furthermore, the pharmaceuticalgrade of the product is indicated by the abbreviation Pharm, whereas the cosmetic grade is indicated by the abbreviation CS (Aqualon, 2000; Ashland, 2018b) . HEC is easily dissolved in cold or hot water, but unlike other cellulosic derivatives, it is insoluble in organic solvents. The low or medium molecular weight types are fully soluble in glycerol and have a good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60% ethanol (Ashland, 2018b) . Specifically, the manufacturer indicates that HEC is \"soluble\" in a 70:30 water/ethanol mixture and partially soluble in a 40:60 water/ethanol mixture, both at 25\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C (Ashland, 2018b) .",

The viscosity dropped to 229 Pa in 60% ethanol due to poor hydration of the polymer in less aqueous media (Brown et al., 1998) . Therefore, high molecular weight HEC (1-2%) could be suitable for the preparation of hand rub gels containing 50-60% ethanol. HEC gel formulations containing > 60% alcohol are not recommended, due to the poor solubility of the polymer and the cloudy appearance that results, as shown in Fig. SF2 (supplementary information) . Since 60-95% ethanol is necessary for efficient hand disinfection, HEC does not seem to be a suitable viscosity enhancer for ABHRs.",

In pure water, viscosity increases exponentially to the increase in concentration. Particularly, a maximum viscosity > 10,000 mPa\u00b7s can be reached in the range of 0.5-5%(w/w) for the high MW grades (i.e. H, M and G). A maximum viscosity of around 1,000 mPa\u00b7s can be reached using the intermediate MW grades (i.e. J, L) at 8-10%(w/w); while a maximum viscosity between 100 mPa.s and 1,000 mPa.s can be obtained using the low MW grades (i.e. E and EL). Limited information is available regarding the effect of ethanol on the viscosity of HPC systems. It is possible to prepare a clear hydrogel using 100% ethanol as a dispersion medium for high, medium and low MW HPC grades. However, gels prepared with 100% ethanol have a slightly lower viscosity than the systems prepared in 100% water. The percentage decrease in viscosity in pure ethanol is more marked for high and intermediate MW HPC, with respect to the low MW HPC. Moreover, the viscosity of gels of HPC in hydroalcoholic media is much higher than gels prepared with pure solvents (even water), at least for the intermediate MW polymers. For instance, 2% HPC gels in a hydroalcoholic mixture (30:70 ethanol/water) had a viscosity of 500 mPa\u00b7s, which is higher than those in pure water or ethanol (270 mPa\u00b7s and 210 mPa\u00b7s, respectively) (Klucel\u2122hydroxypropylcellulose.

Low-viscosity grades work better with alcoholic gels than high-viscosity types, which show clouding and polymer precipitation at higher ethanol content. The manufacturer does not provide any information regarding the effect of ethanol on the viscosity of the dispersions (Feddersen and Thorp, 1993) . The only reference available is from Brown et al. who compared the viscosity of 10% CMC (the type and MW is not specified) in pure water and hydroalcoholic mixtures (up to 40% ethanol). A remarkable increase in the viscosity was observed from pure water (G' 432 Pa) to a mixture containing 30% ethanol (G'1186 Pa), followed by a drop (G' 671 Pa) at 40% ethanol which may be attributed to the poor solubility of CMC in higher alcoholic media (Brown et al., 1998) . According to the literature, low viscosity CMC (being more stable in ethanol) is more suitable for the preparation of gels with a maximum ethanol concentration of 50%. In our experience, it was found that CMC dispersions precipitate and become opaque at 60% (w/w) ethanolic concentrations (Fig. F3 , supplementary information). It is therefore not advisable to use CMC for ABHRs containing higher ethanol concentrations recommended for optimum germicide efficacy.

Gel preparation using this procedure is faster with the surface-treated grades of thickeners such as Car-bopol\u00ae Ultrez types for carbomer or Natrosol R-grades for HPC, due to the low lumpiness of these polymers when dispersed [for carbomer Ultrez grades the direct method should be slightly modified -for more details readers are referred to (Lubrizol, 1998) ]. Also, all carbomer thickeners are faster to disperse than the others due to their pH-dependent viscosity. They remain in the liquid phase during product preparation until the pH is adjusted to neutral. This is an advantage as solvent diffusion and polymer hydration are much more rapid in liquid state than in an already formed gel system. On the other hand, the direct addition method can be slower and more difficult for HPMC and HPC gels (even for surface-treated grades), due to their high tendency to form lumps during dispersion. The direct addition method is a very effective and economical procedure, as long as an efficient stirring system is available for production.",

The wetting procedure is usually operated using mortar and pestle. When a homogenous wet slurry is obtained, the hydroalcoholic solution (containing all the other components previously dissolved) can be gradually added, always under vigorous stirring with the pestle. The addition of the neutralising agent for carbomer polymers follows the same procedure reported in the direct addition method.

However, such a procedure is unsuitable for alcoholic gels because of the potential loss of ethanol content during the preparation, due to evaporation. Roberts at al. reported the preparation of 2% HPMC 2208 4 M hydroalcoholic gels containing 40% ethanol using a modification of the standard \"hot/cold\" technique (Roberts et al., 2007) . Briefly, an aqueous gel is prepared with the \"hot/cold\" technique and then, while cooling, ethanol (and other volatile components, if any) is added under stirring. Although, this procedure could represent an interesting alternative to the previously reported methods, there is not enough information to support its use in the preparation of hydroalcoholic gels containing \u2265 60% ethanol. Another preparation method that can be used to prevent lumping, especially for HPMC and HPC, is a combination (hybrid) of the direct and reverse addition methods. Briefly, a wet slurry is prepared similar to the reverse addition method and then it is gradually added under mechanical or magnetic stirring to the hydroalcoholic mixtures, as in the direct addition method (Ashland, 2017; DOW, 2002) .",

Table 2 provides a summary of these products including their composition, alcoholic content, type of thickeners and legal classification, extracted from the products' label. Various products sold online, with essential information missing on the label, were not included in the Table. Comparing the thickening agents used in the formulation of hand rubs, it is evident that most of the products are made viscous by the use of carbomer and an amine-based neutralising agent (i.e. aminomethyl propanol or triethanolamine). The only exceptions were represented by two products thickened by either HPMC or HEC; and a third product in which carbomer neutralised by sodium hydroxide was used. Interestingly, these three hand gels were among the ones on which we performed the rheological analysis (Table 1) , whereby they showed different rheological behaviour compared to most other analysed products. The product containing HEC was practically liquid, with a white precipitate at the bottom, that could be explained by a decreased polymer solubility at high ethanolic concentration. Indeed, the manufacturer of HEC indicates that this polymer possesses good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60% ethanol (Ashland, 2018b) , hinting at a decrease in polymer solubility at higher ethanolic concentrations. As for the carbomer gel neutralised with sodium hydroxide, it was slightly opaque and less viscous compared to the majority of the carbomer products (Table 1) . Noteworthily, sodium hydroxide is not recommended as a suitable neutralising agent for carbomer-based hydroalcoholic gels by the manufacturer, due to possible polymer precipitation (Lubrizol, 2002) , as stated earlier. Therefore, it can be concluded that the standard combination of carbomer/amine-based neutralising agents seems to form a product with good gel quality.",

These products are marketed in Europe following two different regulatory pathways: the Cosmetic Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) N\u00b01223/2009, 2009) and the Biocidal Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) N\u00b0528/2012, 2012) . The label claims on the product determine the choice of the regulation market. If the product is used to cleanse or clean the skin, then it is subjected to the Cosmetic Products Regulation. While if the use of the product aims at disinfecting the skin from potentially infectious organisms, or if the action of the product goes beyond the general use of personal hygiene, then the hand sanitiser should follow the Biocidal Products Regulation. The marketing authorisation procedures and labelling requirements significantly differ between the two regulatory pathways. Specifically, a biocide has to be authorised by a competent authority (National Health Authority or European Commission) after the evaluation of a dossier containing all the information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the product. The product label must report the concentration of the \"active ingredient\" (including alcohol), the uses for which the product is authorised including all warnings, hazard and precautionary statements. On the other hand, evidence of safety is the key requirement for a cosmetic product. For the market authorisation, the company has to notify the Product Information File (PIF) to the cosmetic products notification portal (CPNP), which makes the information electronically available to competent authorities or poison centres. The product label must contain the list of ingredients (in descending order of weight), particular precautions or warnings and the cosmetic activity unless it is clear from its presentation.",

Conversely, reporting the concentration of ethanol is not mandatory for cosmetic sanitisers. Of the 13 alcoholic gels approved as cosmetics, the amount of ethanol is reported only in 5 products, where one contained only 50% alcohol. Surprisingly, in three products water is listed as the first ingredient followed by ethanol, suggesting an ethanolic concentration of even < 50% (by weight). Such cosmetic products, although good for cleaning the skin, are not fit for use as disinfectants. This can be misleading for the general public, as they might not be aware of the product suitability amid the CoViD-19 pandemic. Consumers aiming to buy an effective hand disinfectant might unintentionally pick up from the shelves a very similar hand gel product, which is however not a disinfectant (i.e. a cosmetic). It is crucial, in this context, that pharmacists and retailers promptly advise customers to choose the appropriate product for the right purpose, i.e. disinfection or simple cleaning. Overall, during a pandemic, providing consumers with the correct information on hand sanitisers should be a priority of utmost importance.

Other gelling polymers could also be used, in theory, as alternatives; however, such polymers do not often provide hydroalcoholic gel products of the same ideal rheological behaviour and appearance, touch feel, ease of use and stability. Carbomer remains, in our opinion, the gold standard gel former in alcohol-based hand sanitisers.",

There is a tangible risk that consumers might, and are using, hand cleaners, which product appearance is very similar to hand disinfectants, while being unaware that such products cannot ensure disinfection and are not fit for use amid the CoViD-19 pandemic. To minimise this risk: 1) customer counselling by pharmacists and retailers regarding the selection of appropriate products for CoViD-19 infection control is highly necessary; 2) online purchase of hand sanitiser from unknown or unreliable e-commerce sites by the public is discouraged; 3) awareness campaigns to educate the public on discriminating between products fit for general hygiene/cleansing from those for disinfection fit the for CoViD-19 infection control should be promoted; and finally, 4) regulatory bodies should revisit current regulations on hand sanitisers to better safeguard consumers.",
