The infectomics view of viral-host interactions on the viral perspective principally focuses on gene acquisition, deletion, and point mutation, while traditional antiviral drug discovery concentrates on viral encoding proteins. Recently, high-throughput technologies, such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics, activity-based protein profiling, microarray analysis, yeast two-hybrid assay, small interfering RNA screening, and micro RNA profiling, have been gradually employed in the research of virus-host interactions. Besides, signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in viral-host interactions provide new insights of infectomics in antiviral drug discovery. In this review, we summarize related infectomics approaches in the studies of virus-host interactions, which shed light on the development of novel antiviral drug targets screening.

New antiviral compounds targeting host gene-encoding proteins or enzymes are in preclinical research, e.g., PRO2000 [McCormack et al., 2010 and bisindolylmaleimide [Ludwig et al., 2003 ]. As nuclear receptors play a combinatorial role in inflammation and immunity [Glass and Ogawa, 2005] , novel drugs targeting these represent a potential strategy for antiviral therapy. Targeting infectome cellular proteins or molecules may lead to reduced host drug resistance, as the human genes encoding targeted cellular proteins are less likely to mutate in response to therapy [Tan et al., 2007] . Infectomics approaches can be used to study complex viral-host interactions to facilitate screening novel antiviral drug targets.

The gene acquisition, deletion, and point mutation are three major events leading to the evolution of microbial pathogens or commensals.

The survival ability of some viruses is enhanced due to viral point mutation, indicating that point mutations may play a critical role in virus spread. For example, in spite of the presence of antibodies against e antigen in the serum, patients infected with HBV still have a high titer of HBV DNA. Akahane et al. [1990] by sequencing the precore region of HBV, identified a point mutation at nucleotide 83 that was present in 98% clones of HBV propagated from the sera of seven patients, and another mutation at nucleotide 86 in 29 clones from two patients, which were responsible for dysfunctional secretion of e antigen. This point mutation is not limited to HBV, but is a general viral phenomenon that has been identified in a variety of viruses, including HIV [Emiliani et al., 1996] , HCV [Heilek and Peterson, 1997] , DENV [Hanley et al., 2003] , influenza virus [Melikyan et al., 2000] , and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [Hwang et al., 1992] .",

For instance, the use of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, like saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir have improved the treatment of HIV-infected patients [Deeks et al., 1997; Eron, 2000] . However, many patients treated with HIV-1 protease inhibitors developed tolerance [Condra et al., 1995; Yerly et al., 1999] requiring an enhanced knowledge of the landscape of viral infections.

Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE)/MSbased proteomics are powerful tools in infectomics research. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF-MS has been successfully used in combination with 2DE for infectomics analyses of the Chlamydia pneumonia elementary body in Hep-2 cells and C. trachomatis reticulate body in HeLa 229 cells [Huang et al., 2002] .

Choi et al., 2004] identified heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) as a protein that specifically co-immnoprecipitated with NS5A but not with NS5B using MS analysis and other approaches. Moreover, the N-terminal regions of NS5A (aa 1-181) was found to interact with the 1-122 amino acid domain of HSP27. When heat shocked, HSP27 and NS5A co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum suggesting an important role during heat shock. Kou et al., 2006 ] examined the possibility of host factors, that inhibit translation in cultured cells, to interact with NS4A [Libbus et al., 2002; Stasko et al., 2002] . Glutathione S-transferase-NS4A interacting protein was found to be congruent with human translation eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Furthermore, the central domain from residues 21-34 of NS4A interacted with eEF1A, causing inhibition of both cap-dependent and HCV internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation activities.",

            "text": "In HIV-1 infectious disease, MS-based proteomic research has also made significant progress. HIV-1 trans-activating (Tat) protein is necessary for viral replication and may play a critical part in HIV-1-associated diseases [Rasheed et al., 2009] . Interestingly, after HIV-1 infection, T cells were protected against apoptosis and survive longer bearing virions. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, it appears likely that HIV-1 Tat protein is responsible for such protection [Coiras et al., 2006] . Using MS-based proteomics, a number of cytoskeletal proteins, e.g., b-tubulin, actin, gelsolin, cofilin, annexin II, and Rac/Rho-GDI (Rac and Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) complex, were found to be downregulated by Tat protein. Reduced expression of these proteins limited the cytoskeletal changes induced by apoptosis and thus maintained HIV-1 virions. MS-based approaches have been used to screen potential inhibitors of Tat protein as novel therapeutic agents. Using nuclear magnetic resonance and MS/MS studies, [Jayasuriya et al., 2002 discovered durhamycin A as an inhibitor of Tat trans-activation. MS-based proteomics have explored other common viruses, including dengue [Pattanakitsakul et al., 2007; Higa et al., 2008] , influenza [Williams et al., 2008; Schwahn et al., 2010] , severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005] , and human respiratory syncytial virus [Brasier et al., 2004; Munday et al., 2010] .",

Activity-directed chemical probes, which target many members of a given enzyme class or protein family, can be used to evaluate the activity of candidate compounds directly in complex proteomes. Identifying protein function and validating its biologic role is a prerequisite to lead discovery (Fig. 1B) . The discovery of reversible enzyme inhibitors can be simplified with this chemical proteomic approach. In order to characterize the specific cellular functions of the cysteine proteases required for survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a chemical proteomic screen was used to characterize these predominant proteases. Falcipain 1 was identified as the only active protease during the invasive merozoite stage. Specific inhibitors for falcipain 1 were then identified by the screening and were able to block parasite invasion of host erythrocytes, suggesting that falcipain 1 played a specific role in host cell invasion with the inhibitor for this enzyme representing a potential new agent for antimalarial therapeutics [Greenbaum et al., 2002] .",

Compared with traditional approaches, the principal advantage of microarrays is that a large number of targets can be analyzed in parallel measurements with low sample consumption (Fig. 1C) . Similar to recombinant DNA [Jackson et al., 1972] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [Mullis and Faloona, 1987] , microarray is a seminal technology with broad application [Stears et al., 2003] , including genomics [DeRisi et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 2000; Sudarsanam et al., 2000] and proteomics [Geiss et al., 2000; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Eickhoff et al., 2002] . The two commonly used microarrays are those for DNA and protein [Templin et al., 2002] where enzyme-substrate [Bulyk et al., 1999; Arenkov et al., 2000; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Zhu et al., 2000] , DNA-protein [Bulyk et al., 1999] , protein-ligand, and different types of protein-protein interactions [Ge, 2000] are studied. DNA microarrays shifted direct antiviral screening programs to rational and genome-wide target-based strategies [Schmid, 2001; Chan et al., 2002; Fritz and Raczniak, 2002; McDevitt et al., 2002; Parkinson, 2002; Cheng et al., 2003] . Since the first report of microarray-based investigations of HIV-induced alterations in host gene expression [Geiss et al., 2000] , microarrays have been used in HIV studies [Izmailova et al., 2003; Khodakov et al., 2008] to investigate macrophage responses of infection by African swine fever virus [Zhang et al., 2006] . Genomic comparison of tuberculosis vaccine strain variants (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin), Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Helicobacter pylori, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been conducted using DNA microarray analysis providing new information on the evolution of these human pathogens suggesting rational approaches to the design of improved diagnostics and antimicrobial agents. However, bridging the gap between genomes and therapeutics is a challenging and time-consuming research process that is rate-limiting [Falb and Jindal, 2002; Zanders et al., 2002] . Protein microarrays also provide a high-throughput platform for target identification. A cluster of secreted proteins (a-defensins 1, 2, and 3) were identified as cell anti-HIV factors (CAFs) [Zhang et al., 2002] that were secreted by cluster of differentiation 8 T-lymphocytes from certain immunologically stable HIV-1 patients to suppress HIV-1 replication. The specific antibody recognition and amino acid sequencing were used to confirm the identity of CAF. Protein microarrays using malaria parasite surface proteins have been developed for studies of parasitic diseases [Bacarese-Hamilton et al., 2002] . The receptorbinding characteristics of two isolates of the novel pandemic H1N1 virus, Cal/09, and A/Hamburg/5/2009 (Ham/09), which were compared directly by carbohydrate microarray analysis [Childs et al., 2009 ].",

In YTH, a protein of interest is fused to a DNA-binding domain and transfected in a yeast host cell with the reporter gene controlled by this DNA-binding domain. This fusion protein can be used as a \"bait\" or \"target\" to screen a library of cDNA clones fused to an activation domain. The functional transcription factor will reconstitute upon the physical interaction between bait and prey proteins, activating a reporter gene (Fig. 1D ). YTH has been widely used in studying virus-host protein-protein interactions, including Escherichia coli bacteriophage 7 [Bartel et al., 1996] , HIV [Rossi et al., 1996] , and HCV [Matsumoto et al., 1997; Mamiya and Worman, 1999; Kittlesen et al., 2000] . Khadka et al. [2011] used a YTH assay to study network interactions between DENV and human proteins and validated a subset of these interactions through split-luciferase, siRNA, and colocalization experiments, resulting in the first genome-wide analysis of DENV-human protein-protein interactions. They identified 93 proteins required for DENV replication, 60 of which that were not been linked to any other viruses, and showed that some of proteins involved in DENV infection also linked to other viruses, particularly HCV [Khadka et al., 2011] . This study has provided new light on DENV-host interactions as well as new potential drugs targeting host proteins. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-68, a useful model for the study of human g-herpes viruses, has been studied using YTH with 23 intraviral protein interactions and 243 viruscellular protein interactions being identified, most of which have never been reported before [Lee et al., 2011] . Such studies may reveal potential cellular proteins that are utilized by MHV-68 or DENV, which may serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies on stomatitis virus [Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2011] , Sesbania mosaic virus [Chowdhury and Savithri, 2011] , flavivirus [Le Breton et al., 2011] , influenza virus [Sharma et al., 2011; Tafforeau et al., 2011] , human cytomegalovirus , and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2 retroviruses [Simonis et al., 2012] also provided novel insights into virus-host interactions.",

Since initial studies on large-scale RNAi screening in Caenorhabditis elegans [Fraser et al., 2000; G\u00f6nczy et al., 2000] , RNAi screening has been routinely used to study of pathogen-host interactions, enabling genome-scale loss of function screening in host cells (Fig. 1E ) [Echeverri and Perrimon, 2006; Boutros and Ahringer, 2008; Mohr et al., 2010; Ou et al., 2012] . Genome-wide RNAi screening identified 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication [Karlas et al., 2010] with host protein p27, a cell cycle regulator, being identified as key for influenza virus replication. A small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle-like kinase 1 reduced influenza virus replication. Another study identified 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication with 23 factors necessary for viral entry confirmed [K\u00f6nig et al., 2010] . Some 250 host cellular factors influencing HIV-1 infection have been identified 40 factors participating in the early stage of HIV infection [Brass et al., 2008; K\u00f6nig et al., 2008] . High-throughput RNAi screening has identified host factors involved in virus progression, including those for HCV Tai et al., 2009 ], West Nile virus [Krishnan et al., 2008] , DENV [Sessions et al., 2009] , and drosophila C virus [Cherry et al., 2005] . miRNA Profiling miRNAs [Lee et al., 1993] play important roles in the control of stress signaling [Mendell and Olson, 2012] , metabolism [Rottiers and Naar, 2012] , tumorigenesis [Chen, 2005] , and viral-host interactions [Jopling et al., 2005; Lecellier et al., 2005] . Highthroughput miRNA profiling technologies, including quantitative reverse transcription PCR-based methods, hybridization-based methods, RNA-seq, and pri-and pre-miRNA quantification [Pritchard et al., 2012] have greatly enhanced knowledge regarding the role of miRNA in viral-host interactions (Fig. 1F) . miRNA profiling technologies combined with messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling have provided new insight into HCV-host interactions. Investigation of miRNAs and mRNAs involved in HCV infection identified 43 differentially expressed miRNAs and 6,850 differentially expressed mRNAs expression levels of which were changed during HCV infection [Liu et al., 2010; Steuerwald et al., 2010] . These altered expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs were involved in metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis, and cytokine/chemokine pathways, and in the progression of HCV-induced chronic hepatitis. Another study revealed 10 miRNAs that were downregulated in Hep-394 cells with 23 miRNAs upregulated [Braconi et al., 2010] . The identified miRNAs and their putative targets may be used as the basis for anti-HCV therapies, suggesting that combined miRNA and mRNA profiling may represent a novel approach to understand HCV infection and design new anti-HCV strategies.",

Influenza virus can interrupt this pathway to create a suitable environment for replication. Over the past few decades, nearly all classical signaling pathways were reported to participate in viral infections. Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) signaling initiates its cascades by binding to specific cell surface receptors that have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity [ten Dijke and Hill, 2004] and can modulate HCV infection [Lee et al., 2002; Rowan et al., 2008] . For virus-induced tumorigenesis, hepatitis B virus X protein and liver cancer-derived hepatitis C virus core proteins play essential roles in shifting TGF-b signaling from tumor suppression to tumorigenesis and epithelialmesenchymal transition [Battaglia et al., 2009; Murata et al., 2009 ]. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), a family of transcription factors, plays a key role orchestrating innate and acquired host immune responses to pathogen infection [Rahman and McFadden, 2011] . Bovine foamy virus can activate the NF-kB pathway via action of its transactivator and enhanced viral transcription . Other viral proteins involved in NF-kB activation include Tax of HTLV-1. Viral proteins can inhibit the NF-kB pathway and include Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 and open reading frame 2 of Torque teno virus. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) encodes a miRNA that controls viral replication by activating the NF-kB pathway demonstrating an important role of KSHV miRNAs in regulating viral latency and lytic replication via manipulation of the host survival pathway [Lei et al., 2010] . This suggests that not only the viral proteins but also miRNAs could participate in the regulation of host signaling pathways.",

            "text": "Virus-host interactions have indicated that cellular processes play important roles in viral infection. Autophagy, which can be divided into three categories: microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and macroautophagy [Cecconi and Levine, 2008] , have been linked to both innate and adaptive immunity versus viral infection [Lee and Iwasaki, 2008; Orvedahl and Levine, 2009 ]. Autophagy can be both activated [Ait-Goughoulte et al., 2008; Alavian et al., 2011] or inhibited [Zhou and Spector, 2008; Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009 ] by viral infection. In turn, autophagy can also promote or inhibit [Orvedahl et al., 2010] viral infection. Therefore, unraveling the role of autophagy during viral infection is important for targeting autophagy and may provide new strategies for antiviral therapies. Apoptosis and glucose metabolism are also involved in viral infection. Noch et al., 2012] demonstrate the role of JC virus (John Cunningham virus) T-antigen in regulating glucose metabolism in brain tumor cells. T-antigen was downregulated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 6-aminonicotinamide, and oxythiamine. T-antigen can also modulate expression of the glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase 2, and the pentose phosphate enzyme, transaldolase 1 Epstein-Barr virus can inhibit induction of a pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3-only containing protein (NOXA) by ionomycin inhibiting apoptosis in B cells [Yee et al., 2011] . In addition, HCV NS4B protein, a component of a membraneassociated cytoplasmic HCV replication complex [Hugle et al., 2001] , has been reported as an inducer of apoptosis via a mitochondrila pathway [Zhao et al., 2012] . These findings suggested that cellular processes of the host cells could be altered during viral infection, which could contribute to the development of new Fig. 2 .

Integrated signaling networks functionally regulate the cellular processes of viral infection; implicated signaling pathways include NF-kB pathway, apoptotic pathway, autophagic pathway, and glucose metabolic pathway.

Studies based on genomics and proteomics approaches have established the foundation of network-based investigations for viralhost interactions, creating opportunities for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Six infectomics technologies commonly used for drug discovery have been described in this review: MS-based proteomics, ABPP, microarray analysis, YTH assays, siRNA screening, and miRNA profiling. Together, they have the potential to elucidate and integrate the dynamic interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts during the development of infectious diseases. Chemical infectomics, which has the advantages of both highthroughput chemistry and infectomics, is an emerging method for validating drug targets and will revolutionize approaches to infectious diseases. The infectomics view provides: (i) a global detection and integrative dissection of microbial and host infectomes, that is critical to understanding the process of microbial pathogenesis and developing better diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for infectious diseases; (ii) a powerful tool to investigate microbial and human genomes to address the present crisis in antibiotic resistance; (iii) a new method of utilizing pharmacomes (lipid-based drug delivery systems) for optimal drug therapy; and (iv) the opportunity to exploit probiotics as ecological approaches to infectious diseases. With such tools, prevention and treatment of microbial infections will eventually enter an era when holistic solutions to health problems can be efficiently individualized. ",

            "text": "High-throughput technologies and omics approaches currently used in novel drug target screening. Six technologies are commonly used in drug discovery. (A) MS-based proteomic approach. (B) Schematic view of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Cell lysates are mixed with activity-directed chemical probes targeting candidate proteins, and then the tags of the probes could be detected by in-gel analysis. (C) Schematic view of protein microarray analysis. First, the artificial antigens are attached on the solid substrate. Then, the primary antibodies are deposited to the hapten. Finally, the primary antibodies bind to the secondary antibodies with the labels for detection. (D) Schematic view of yeast two-hybrid assay (YTH). The protein of interest (bait) is fused to a DNA-binding domain and transfected in a yeast host cell that contains a reporter gene controlled by this DNA-binding domain. The functional transcription factor (TF) will reconstitute upon the physical interaction between bait and prey proteins, leading to the activation of the reporter gene. (E) Schematic view of siRNA screening.Step I, preparation of siRNAs; step II, rearray siRNAs into 384-well plates for high-throughput screening; step III, transfection of siRNAs into target cell lines; and step IV assay phenotype by identifying the plate position (see black cell). (F) Schematic view of miRNA profiling. The total RNAs are hybridized with the miRNAs. Then the RNAs are labeled with the pCp-Cy3 for detection.
