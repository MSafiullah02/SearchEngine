In our cohort, more than half of all infants had wheezed in the first 12 months of life. At 6 months of age, 48.6% of all infants had wheezed, while at 12 months of age 57% had ever wheezed. Asthma develops in one of every six children in Australia and is the most common chronic disease leading to disability in childhood 17. A maternal as opposed to a paternal history of asthma is thought to confer the single greatest risk for development of allergic asthma in the offspring 18. Epidemiological studies aimed at further elucidating the relationship between genetic and environmental factors associated with maternal asthma and the subsequent development of allergic asthma in early life have mostly produced indirect evidence for a complex gene\u2013environmental interaction facilitating a predominant role of maternal asthma during pregnancy for the development of subsequent asthma in the offspring 19. For example, maternal imprinting of \u2018asthma genes\u2019 after conception 20, intra\u2010uterine infections leading to distorted immune responses at the feto\u2013maternal interface 21, previous pregnancies and exposure to children during pregnancy 22, placental dysfunction leading to low birth weight, premature labor, and subsequent prematurity 23, and intra\u2010uterine smoke exposure 24, 25 have all been linked to an altered risk for the development of asthma in early life. Some of those risk factors (e.g., low birth weight) have also been associated with maternal asthma exacerbations during pregnancy in independent cohorts 26. A direct relationship between maternal asthma during pregnancy (its severity, control, and management) and subsequent asthma risk in the offspring has yet to be established prospectively.",

There was a significant association between respiratory tract infections in pregnancy and asthma in childhood (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05, 2.77) which was strongest for infections in the first trimester, and related to the number of infections recorded 29. Similar data were reported by Calvani et al. 30 in 2004, among 338 children with asthma whose mothers were asked about \u2018flu episodes\u2019 and \u2018fever episodes\u2019 during pregnancy by questionnaire. The odds of asthma in children (>3 yr old) was significantly increased when mothers reported flu episodes (adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.1, 3.2) or fevers in pregnancy (adjusted OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.2, 3.9). In particular, flu episodes in the third trimester increased the risk of asthma by more than sixfold (adjusted OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.33, 33); however, most mothers reported episodes only in one trimester, suggesting they were most likely recalling their worst episode 30.

The viral causes of infant wheezing were not investigated in this study, and although infants whose mothers had respiratory viral infections in pregnancy had more wheeze, this did not translate into more bronchiolitis, croup, or hospitalization. The infants whose mothers had infections in pregnancy were more likely to be treated for wheeze with beta agonists, suggesting an increase in wheezing of more mild severity. There is the possibility of recall bias from parents or misclassification of wheeze by parents and the possibility of missed infections in the virus\u2010negative mothers. In addition, we do not have data on baseline infections (in the absence of clinical symptoms of a common cold) for all pregnant women, so the possibility of colonization by viruses contributing to positive detections in pregnancy is possible. However, we have previously noted that women who respond negatively to the CCQ are unlikely to be PCR\u2010positive to virus 3. Maternal BMI was significantly different between the groups, and this may have influenced the results we observed since maternal BMI has been reported as an independent risk factor for wheeze in the offspring's first 7 yr of life 31.
