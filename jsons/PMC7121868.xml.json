A comprehensive evaluation including patient history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging is essential to differentiate ARDS from similar respiratory conditions and to initiate appropriate therapy. The diagnostic criteria for ARDS, according to the 2012 Berlin definition [2], includes: (1) acute onset (\u22641 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms), (2) presence of bilateral opacities on chest radiograph or computed tomographic scan, (3) exclusion of cardiac failure or fluid overload as the origin of pulmonary edema, and (4) impairment in oxygenation (characterized by 200 < Pao2/FIo2 ratio \u2264 300 mmHg in mild ARDS; 100 < Pao2/FIo2 ratio \u2264 200 mmHg in moderate ARDS; and Pao2/FIo2 ratio \u2264 100 mmHg in severe ARDS). Physical examination typically demonstrates evidence of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, tachycardia, and accessory muscle usage. It is important to distinguish ARDS from other conditions that result in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral lung infiltrates, including pneumonia (viral or diffuse bacterial), cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute inhalation injury, and malignancy (Table 1).\n",

The majority of affected patients will require sedation and mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. Treatment of reversible disease processes (e.g., infection) should accompany respiratory support efforts. Considerations in mechanical ventilation include: (1) low tidal volume ventilation, or lung protective ventilation, which has been shown to improve mortality by reducing VALI and decreasing inflammatory mediator release, (2) titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels to recruit atelectatic, undamaged alveoli [3], and (3) permissive hypercapnia to minimize VALI due to alveolar over distension. A subpopulation meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials suggests that prone positioning during mechanical ventilation is associated with improved survival, although patient selection should be reserved for severely ill persons failing to improve with low tidal volume ventilation strategies [4]. A spontaneous breathing trial is indicated in the patient who is hemodynamically stable and able to maintain oxygen requirements through noninvasive methods.",

Classification of pulmonary hypertension is essential in estimating prognosis and initiating therapy. This classification has undergone minor modifications, with the most recent occurring during the fourth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (Dana Point, 2008); this classification divides pulmonary hypertension into five categories based on commonalities in pathophysiologic mechanism of disease, clinical presentation, and therapeutic approaches [8]. These five categories include: (1) pulmonary arterial hypertension, (2) pulmonary hypertension owing to left heart disease, (3) pulmonary hypertension owing to lung diseases and/or hypoxia, (4) chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and (5) pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms. Further breakdown within classes can be reviewed in Table 2.\n\n",

A thorough review of systems should be performed to identify symptoms suggestive of associated and underlying conditions.

Enlargement of the right ventricle and right atrium and evidence of underlying pulmonary disease (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) may also be noted. Changes on electrocardiogram do not correlate with disease severity or prognosis but may aid in detecting right ventricular disease. Signs of right ventricular hypertrophy or strain on electrocardiogram may include right axis deviation, incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, increased P wave amplitude in lead II, and R wave/S wave ratio > 1 in lead V1. The transthoracic echocardiogram is useful in the estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and the assessment of right ventricular size, thickness, and function. Evidence of congenital heart disease\nand the status of the heart valves and septum can also be determined by the echocardiogram. Pulmonary function testing, including lung volumes, diffusion capacity, and spirometry, may aid in characterizing underlying lung disease such as emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis. A six minute walk test can be useful in establishing baseline function, estimating prognosis, and monitoring clinical response to treatment. This involves exercise oximetry during a timed six minute walk. Polysomnography may be appropriate if sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) is suspected. A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is the preferred imaging study to evaluate patients for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.",

Small pneumothoraces involving less than 15 % of the hemithorax (<3 cm between the lung and chest wall on chest radiograph) may resolve without therapy, provided no additional leakage occurs. Complete resolution is expected within 10 days. Supplemental oxygen can facilitate resolution by increasing the pressure gradient of nitrogen from the pleural space into the capillaries and facilitating resorption of the pleural air. In uncomplicated cases of PSP, both manual aspiration and small-bore catheter insertion with Heimlich valve are cost-effective and minimally invasive interventions with comparable success rates and shorter hospitalizations as compared to tube thoracostomy [15, 16]. A large pneumothorax or a patient with severe symptoms is associated with increased likelihood of failure of simple aspiration [17] and will likely require chest tube insertion to permit reexpansion of the lung. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery pleurodesis, chemical pleurodesis, or thoracotomy should be considered after two ipsilateral PSPs or when a 5- to 7-day course of chest tube therapy fails to result in lung reexpansion. The recurrence rate for PSP is approximated at 30 % and does not appear affected by treatment choice [13].",

Management of the disease focuses on: (1) symptom reduction, (2) improvement in quality of life, and (3) prevention of exacerbations. Treatment of the underlying disease process, such as gamma globulin replacement in hypogammaglobulinemia, may aid in delaying or preventing the progression of bronchiectasis. Inhaled bronchodilators, antiinflammatory agents (oral or inhaled glucocorticoids, NSAIDs), antigastroesophageal reflux therapy, and immunizations (influenza and pneumococcal) may be beneficial in some patients. Oral antibiotic regimens are used as preventive therapy in patients experiencing two or more exacerbations within 1 year; a macrolide is the antibiotic of choice (azithromycin 500 mg three times weekly). The role of aerosolized antibiotics in the management of bronchiectasis remains unclear, although early investigations suggest that select inhaled antibiotics may decrease symptoms, lower sputum bacterial density, and improve patient reported quality of life [27]. In acute exacerbations, oral antibiotics are used to reduce both bacterial load and inflammatory mediators, and antibiotic selection should be based on prior sputum culture results (for patients without prior culture data, fluoroquinolones are an appropriate broad spectrum option). While duration of oral antibiotic therapy in the acute exacerbation is ill-defined, first time exacerbations favor a 10-day duration while recurrent exacerbations benefit from 14 days of therapy. Inpatient treatment during an acute exacerbation should be considered for patients demonstrating hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, fever \u226538 \u00b0C, or failure to clinically improve on outpatient oral antibiotic therapy. While rigorous population-based studies are lacking, airway clearance techniques, particularly high frequency chest wall oscillation (positive expiratory pressure or PEP) , are generally recommended and may be beneficial in reducing sputum volume and improving exercise tolerance [28].

The most frequent symptoms of pulmonary sarcoidosis are dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort. Patients may present initially with nonpulmonary symptoms including fever, arthralgias, malaise, and fatigue. Nearly one half of patients with sarcoidosis are identified incidentally on the basis of abnormalities on chest roentgenogram performed for other reasons. Pulmonary exam findings are rare but may include crackles, wheezing, or digital clubbing in advanced disease. Erythema nodosum may be present and is characteristic of acute sarcoidosis.",

The most common radiographic finding is bilateral hilar adenopathy. Additional radiographic findings have been organized into a well-known staging system which provides a framework to understand lung involvement [30], although does not correlate to disease progression or prognosis (Table 7). HRCT can aid in further evaluation of chest radiograph abnormalities and identify irregularities in the lung parenchyma. Transbronchial lung biopsy with transbronchial needle aspiration is the preferred diagnostic modality in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes [31]. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are elevated in 75 % of patients, although poor sensitivity and insufficient specificity limit its utility as a diagnostic test. PFTs are useful to assess the degree of respiratory impairment and assist in monitoring disease progression. PFTs typically demonstrate a restrictive pattern with reduced DLco and vital capacity.\n",

            "text": "The course of sarcoidosis is variable, with some patients experiencing complete resolution in symptoms and others having slowly progressive disease. The approach to the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a challenge for clinicians due to the complex, multisystem nature of the disease [32]. The majority of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis do not require therapy due to the absence of symptoms, nonprogression of disease, and likelihood of spontaneous remission. For symptomatic patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, dyspnea remains the indicator for initiation of therapy. The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms and reduce the burden of granulomatous inflammation. Oral glucocorticoids remain the first line therapy for relieving pulmonary symptoms, although steroids have not been shown to modify the overall course of the disease. For this reason, treatment with corticosteroids is usually reserved for patients with worsening symptoms or organ-threatening pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. The typical initial therapy for symptomatic sarcoidosis is prednisone 0.3\u20130.6 mg/kg ideal body weight for 4\u20136 weeks after which the patient should be reassessed (evaluation of symptoms, radiographic imaging, and PFTs). If the reassessment demonstrates stable or improved disease, the dosage can be tapered to 0.2\u20130.4 mg/kg for an additional 4\u20136 weeks. A maintenance dose of oral glucocorticoids can be continued at 0.25\u20130.5 mg/kg per day with reassessment at 4\u201312 week intervals. Length of therapy in patients who demonstrate positive response to oral glucocorticoids is unknown, although a 12-month treatment course is generally accepted to minimize relapses. There may be a role for inhaled steroids in the treatment of symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis; however, there is limited data to support their use. For patients who cannot tolerate glucocorticoids, alternative regimens may include antimalarial drugs ( chloroquine, hydroxhycholorquine) or immunosuppressive agents ( methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide). Complications due to opportunistic infections while on immunosuppression therapy are rare, although clinicians should monitor patients for these risks. Patients with end stage pulmonary sarcoidosis may be candidates for surgical resection, bronchial artery embolization, or lung transplantation. Unfortunately, as many as two thirds of patients will relapse after cessation of treatment.",
