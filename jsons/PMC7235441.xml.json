Generally,\ndrugs with potential QT prolongation should be avoided in patients with QTc greater\nthan 500 milliseconds (or 550 milliseconds with intraventricular conduction delay)\nespecially in the setting of moderate to severe structural heart disease and\npatients with high-grade atrioventricular block without a pacemaker and/or\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator in place.31,32 In patients with baseline QTc\ngreater than 500 milliseconds and normal or mild cardiomyopathy, benefit may\noutweigh the risk and shared decision-making should be discussed. The checklist\nshown in Figure 2 should be\napplied for all patients. This includes minimizing concomitant prolonging QT drugs\nand concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors and substrates, and maintaining normal serum\nelectrolyte levels. Bradycardia can precipitate TdP and thus conditions or\nmedications with the potential to slow the heart rate should also be avoided. These\nfollowing criteria should prompt dose reduction or drug discontinuation: subsequent\nQTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (or 550 milliseconds with\nintraventricular conduction delay) in those with baseline QTc less than 500\nmilliseconds; \u0394QTc greater than 60 milliseconds.30,32 A preliminary report showed\nthat the maximal change in the QT interval among patients with COVID-19 treated with\ncombined hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin occurred between days 3 and 4.33 Thus, in a\nsetting with limited resources, QTc interval measurement may be performed on days\n3\u20134.",
