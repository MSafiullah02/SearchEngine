All the CoVs detected from domestic fowls and some CoVs detected from wild birds belong to the genus Gammacoronavirus, while some other CoVs detected from wild birds have constituted the genus Deltacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2012; Jordan, Hilt, Poulson, Stallknecht, & Jackwood, 2015).",

This may facilitate rapid adaptation of the viruses to new hosts and ecological niches (Lau et al., 2016; Moreno et al., 2017). Some CoVs distinct from IBVs and mainly circulating in birds other than chickens have been identified (Chen et al., 2013; de Groot et al., 2012). In 2013, we found that CoVs dominant (i.e. mainly circulating) in ducks were phylogenetically distinct from IBVs and may represent a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by the sequences of three regions in the viral 1ab gene (Chen et al., 2013). Then, we sequenced the genomic sequence of the duck\u2010dominant CoV and conducted a surveillance of CoVs in chickens and ducks and found solid evidences to support that the duck\u2010dominant CoVs are distinct from common IBVs and should represent a novel species in the genus Gammacoronavirus (Zhuang et al., 2015).",

According to the ICTV demarcation of CoV species, CoVs that share an overall amino acid (aa) identity of more than 90% in these seven Coronaviridae\u2010wide conserved domains should be regarded as the same species (de Groot et al., 2012).",

The faeces samples were collected through taking approximately 0.5 ml wet and fresh faeces on the ground or cages. The drinking\u2010water samples were collected through taking approximately 3.5 ml drinking water from the water trough for a group of birds in LPMs. The swab samples were stored in 1.5 ml phosphate\u2010buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol, and the faeces samples were stored in 3.5 ml phosphate\u2010buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol, and the drinking\u2010water samples were stored with 0.4 ml glycerol.
