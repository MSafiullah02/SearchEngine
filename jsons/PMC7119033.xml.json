In reality, there seems to be a J-shaped curve describing the relationship between level of exercise and risk of URI, whereby individuals who are sedentary and those who perform excessive strenuous exercise are both at increased risk of infection [1], [2]. Although the reason for this relationship is not completely understood, an impaired immune response appears to be a major contributing factor to susceptibility in athletes who perform excessive strenuous exercise.",

A study of illness incidence among collegiate athletes [3] found that 98% of the athletes experienced at least one illness during a 2-month period in the winter. The overwhelming majority of the illnesses were classified as URIs. Other evidence indicates that athletes tend to be risk takers, and may thereby increase their likelihood of contacting certain types of infectious disease, most notably sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [4]. The relationship between exercise and relative risk of infectious disease remains debatable. What is clear is that athletes will experience the affects of common infectious diseases that may hinder participation, performance, and in some cases their long-term well-being.",

Although there is no evidence to suggest that exercise during a viral infection increases the likelihood of myocarditis in humans, exertion does increase viral replication rates and severity of morbidity associated with myocarditis in murine models infected with Coxsackie virus [6]. Viral myocarditis has been associated with sudden cardiac death, and accounts for roughly 3% to 5% of known cases in young athletes [7]. The ability of common URI viruses to cause myocarditis and a potential lethal outcome remains a strong reminder of the risks of common viral infections; however, because any sudden death occurrence in a young athlete receives significant publicity, this association may be overvalued, and should not be the sole factor determining return to training activity.",

            "text": "Conflicting evidence exists regarding performance and physiologic markers in individuals who have URIs. Some studies [8], [9] show alterations in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and respiratory function in persons experiencing infectious URIs. Conversely, Weidner et al [10], [11] found no significant change in pulmonary function tests, VO2 maximum, or duration of cold symptoms during repeated submaximal exercise testing in symptomatic young adults infected with a strain of rhinovirus compared with controls. One distinguishing factor among these data may be the presence or absence of a fever. In Weidner's work, the participants did not have a fever. The finding of fever may signify a more severe infection. Febrile illness results in increased metabolism, caloric, and fluid requirements, and can decrease pulmonary perfusion, concentric muscle strength, and cognitive function [12]. As a result of sparse and conflicting data regarding athletic performance during acute viral URIs, the decision to allow athletic participation can be a difficult one. A regularly cited guideline that may be useful is the so called \u201cneck check\u201d [13]. In this scenario, if symptoms are limited to locations above the neck (nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and the like), the athlete is allowed to perform a 10-minute test period of light exercise. If the athlete feels better or symptoms do not worsen, he or she may continue the workout at a subnormal intensity, with gradual return to full intensity training over subsequent days. If symptoms worsen during the test period, the training session should be ended. If symptoms below the neck or systemic symptoms are present (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, and so on) physical exertion should be delayed until these symptoms have resolved [13]. The use of this management approach may help somewhat to objectify return-to-activity decisions. It may also lessen the risk of the athlete developing complications such as viral myocarditis.",

Symptoms and viral etiology are similar to those experienced with URIs.

Bacterial infection should be suspected in patients who have purulent nasal discharge, facial or tooth pain, unilateral sinus tenderness, or symptoms that worsen after initial improvement [17]. Symptoms that last for longer than 10 days also increase the likelihood of a bacterial infection. In these cases, up to 60% of sinus aspiration cultures are positive for a bacterial pathogen [18]. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are the two most common causes of bacterial rhinosinusitis in the community setting, accounting for up to 70% of cases [19]. Antibiotic treatment regimens are recommended to be reserved for those individuals who have URI symptoms lasting greater than 10 to 14 days, or whose symptoms worsen after 5 to 7 days [20].

There are anecdotal reports of higher incidence of sinus infections in swimmers, and even a term applied to this malady, so-called \u201cswimmer's sinusitis.\u201d Leading theories as to etiology of swimmer's sinusitis include the introduction of water into the nasal cavity and sinuses, and cooling of the skin and nasal mucosa during swimming. Scientific support for either theory is sparse. In a single study comparing 20 swimmers and controls, Deitmer and Scheffler [21] found that swimmers report more nasal congestion symptoms and more episodes of sinusitis compared with controls. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination of the same individuals revealed swimmers to have a higher incidence of irritated nasal mucosa and swollen adenoids, but no significant change in function of nasal mucosa. As a result, the authors postulated that cooling of the skin during water immersion may lead to alterations in nasal blood flow and swelling of the nasal mucosa, and ultimately to increased risk of sinusitis [21].",

This often results after a superficial abrasion compromises the integrity of the epidermis, allowing for penetration by pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most identifiable causative agent of OE. Fungal organisms such as Aspergillus have also been identified [22]. Acute OE is characterized by otalgia, reduced hearing, and aural drainage. Examination is likely to reveal foul-smelling discharge, erythema and edema of the auditory canal, and tragal tenderness. Enlarged preauricular, postauricular, or cervical lymph nodes may also be appreciated. Treatment involves cleansing of the auditory canal and use of topical medications. Cleaning of debris from the canal by irrigation allows for maximum effectiveness of aural preparations. Combination antibiotic/corticosteroid drops (eg, polymyxin B/hydrocortisone) are usually effective. An acidifying/corticosteroid agent (2% acetic acid/hydrocortisone) can be used as an alternative for mild infections. Antifungal medications should be added in cases in which otomycosis is suspected. Use of an ear wick may be needed with each of these treatments to help retain the medications within the auditory canal.",

Recurrent water exposure in these athletes may lead to decreased amounts of cerumen, drying of the ear canal, and resultant itching. Digital manipulation and introduction of cleaning instruments into the canal to alleviate itching often results in abrasions of the epidermis, providing an opportunity for infection to occur [24]. Athletes who have OE should keep the ear dry by staying out of the water during treatment. This may be accomplished by using form-fitting ear plugs as well. Prevention measures include education efforts to eliminate the use of ear cleaning utensils and excessive efforts to remove protective cerumen. Combination drying/acidifying drops such as isopropyl alcohol and acetic acid can also be used as a prophylactic measure.",

Examination of the eye classically reveals erythema and edema of the conjunctiva with associated watery discharge. A tender preauricular lymph node may also be present. Treatment consists of limiting contact with other individuals to prevent spread, and supportive care. Ocular vasoconstrictors and cool compresses may provide symptom relief.

Similar to viral conjunctivitis, bilateral eye involvement is often preceded by unilateral symptoms. The presence of purulent discharge accompanied by conjunctival inflammation is the hallmark of bacterial conjunctivitis. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms are relatively poor prognosticators for differentiating among the different causes of conjunctivitis [26]. The use of empiric antibiotic therapy is therefore controversial. In general, most practitioners opt to treat suspected bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotics. In this case, using an inexpensive broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Ointments such as erythromycin or bacitracin-polymyxin B may be used in children. Ophthalmic solutions (trimethoprim-polymyxin B) are preferred for adults. Aminoglycosides provide an alternative class of antibiotic therapy and are good choices for suspected gram-negative pathogens. The use of cultures is indicated in refractory and severe cases of conjunctivitis.",

Unfortunately, clinical examination is unreliable in determining the presence or absence of an enlarged spleen [37]. Diagnostic ultrasound can be performed in these situations to determine absolute spleen size, or even used serially to determine regression of splenomegaly [32]. This practice, however, is unlikely to be cost-effective, given the small risk of splenic rupture. Furthermore, there is a wide range of what constitutes normal spleen size among athletes [38].

The primary etiology of aseptic meningitis is the enteroviruses [50], [51], [52] (echovirus, Coxsackie A and B viruses, polioviruses, and the numbered enteroviruses) [52]. Enteroviruses are responsible for 55% to 70% of all aseptic meningitic cases and for 85% to 95% of cases for which a pathogen is ultimately identified [52]. Other viral causes include arboviruses, herpesviruses, zoster, adenovirus, HIV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM), measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, parvovirus, and rotavirus. There are multiple nonviral etiologies, including fungal (blastomycosis, coccidomycosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis), bacterial etiologies (Mycoplasma, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis [TB], Rickettsia species, Leptospira interogans, Listeria monocytogenes), protozoal etiologies, and noninfectious etiologies (medications, collagen vascular disease, malignancy, Reye's syndrome, adrenal leukodystrophy, vaccinations, poisoning, granulomatous disease, toxin exposure, trauma, Kawasaki disease, multiple sclerosis, and inborn errors of metabolism) [51], [52]. The nonviral infectious etiologies are included because they are not easily detected by gram stain and are difficult to culture, often taking weeks to months to grow [52].",

These similarities can present a diagnostic dilemma. The presentation of meningitis can be acute (less than 24 hours) or subacute (occurring over 1 to 7 days) [50], [51]. Obvious signs in the clinical presentation of meningitis include the classic triad of fever, headache, and neck stiffness (meningismus) [51], [52]. This triad is often accompanied by other nonspecific symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, diarrhea, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs. Symptoms can be accompanied by mental status changes ranging from lethargy to coma [50], [51], [52]. It is important to note that in a clinical series studying bacterial meningitis [51], [53], only half of patients over the age of 16 presented with the classic triad. Clinical presentation may differ based on the age of the affected individual (neonate to elderly) [52]. Bacterial meningitis can have both a rapidly progressive and fulminant course, or an indolent course consisting of vague symptoms [51]. An indolent course is common when an individual has been pretreated with oral antibiotics [51].",

            "text": "Based on signs and symptoms and physical examination findings, it is virtually impossible to distinguish asceptic from septic bacterial causes of meningitis. Peripheral blood cell counts can either be normal or elevated [54]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the most important laboratory test for distinguishing aseptic from bacterial meningitis. The CSF fluid should be sent for cell count, protein, glucose, culture, and gram stain [50], [51], [54]. There is debate whether neuroimaging is needed before lumbar puncture (LP). There is a growing trend to image all patients before LP. Absolute guidelines for neuroimaging include impaired consciousness, deteriorating Glasgow Coma Score, signs of increased intracranial pressure (unstable blood pressure or heart rate, papilledema), and focal neurologic signs [51]. Age-appropriate, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics should not be delayed once blood cultures have been obtained if neuroimaging is to be performed [50], [51], [52]. More specific antibiotic coverage is added based on results of CSF Gram stain and culture and condition of the patient [50], [51]. Initially, with viral meningitis or encephalitis, CSF samples usually demonstrate a pleocytosis. White cell counts can range from normal to several hundred cells per mm3\n[51], [52]. Early in the course of the illness, the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells can predominate, but a shift to lymphocytic predominance occurs rapidly [51], [52]. In bacterial meningitis, the white count is usually higher [50], [51]. If the Gram stain does not reveal an etiology, and a monocytosis predominates, viral cultures should be attempted from the original specimen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of the CSF can be sent for suspected viral or bacterial etiologies. PCR examination of CSF is especially valuable if herpes simplex virus or enteroviruses are suspected based on seasonal predilection or history [50], [51], [52] Increased red blood cells (RBCs) in the CSF are characteristic of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection [51]. CSF protein in aseptic meningitis is usually less elevated compared with bacterial meningitis [50], [52]. CSF glucose should be compared with a simultaneous serum glucose. A CSF:serum glucose ratio of 66% is considered normal [50]. In aseptic meningitis, CSF glucose samples are usually within the normal range. Bacterial meningitis will cause a drop in CSF glucose [50], [52].",

Caliciviruses are by far the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Both Norwalk-like and Rotaviruses can cause outbreaks of infection by consumption of contaminated food or water; however, it is very important to recognize the very contagious nature of person-to-person spread as well. Caliciviruses can be found not only in feces, but also in vomitus, and have been reported to spread by airborne droplets in nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, and cruise ships. Both viruses survive well on environmental surfaces and are difficult to deactivate with ordinary cleaning agents (diluted bleach, 1:10 strength). Both require a small inoculum size. These factors make it difficult to control outbreaks in closed populations. Adenoviruses and Astroviruses are less well-studied, but are likely transmitted by person-to-person spread. Adenovirus may have a less contagious nature in adults [58]. Symptoms can include nausea and vomiting and large-volume watery stools (up to 10 or more per day) [61].",

Three of these bacteria commonly produce acute gastrointestinal infection [61]. ETEC produces enterotoxins that are similar to toxins produced by cholera. It will colonize the small intestine and release enterotoxin that binds to receptors on the enterocytes but does not damage them [61]. The toxins act on the glucose-mediated sodium pump and lead to secretion of water, with decreased absorption of water and electrolytes. It is the most common cause of \u201ctraveler's diarrhea\u201d [57]. The most frequent serotype for EHEC is O157:H7 [58], [61]. Its cytotoxin can cause damage to the kidneys and platelets, and cause hemolysis to red blood cells in a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [61]. HUS affects up to 13% of young children infected. Transmission occurs from undercooked ground beef and person-to-person contact [58].",

There is no specific treatment for viral enteritis. Most cases are short-lived, lasting only 1 or 2 days. S enteritis should only be treated in immunocompromised individuals or those who have asplenia (secondary to predisposition to infection with encapsulated organisms) [57], [61]. Antibiotics are not indicated in healthy individuals, because they do not shorten the illness but do prolong the carrier state [57]. Most cases of E coli diarrhea are self-limited. Dysenteric illness should be treated with antibiotics [57]. Shigella manifesting with fever and dysentery should be treated because the antibiotic decreases fever, diarrhea, and excretion of the organism in the stool [57]. Campylobacter treatment is supportive and antibiotic treatment does not appear to improve the gastroenteritis. Early treatment is thought to be effective in eradicating the organism from the stool [57]. Giardia should be treated with antibiotics for comfort and to decrease transmission. Asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic patients who have entamoeba should be treated with antiparacytic medications. In immunocompetent hosts, Cryptosporidium is usually self-limited and does not require antiparacytic treatment [57].

The disease is endemic to the Northeast and North Central states and parts of the upper Midwest (New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), and is spreading to new states [65]. Disease is most prevalent May through August, corresponding to peak human outdoor activity [63], [65].",

            "text": "Lyme disease is found in three stages. Stage 1, early localized stage, begins days to weeks following the tick bite. This stage may be characterized by the distinctive rash, erythema chronicum migrans, which occurs in 60% to 80% of cases. Mild systemic symptoms may accompany the rash, including fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, fever, and chills. Physical examination may reveal stiff neck and regional lymphadenopathy. If not recognized and treated, the skin lesion and symptoms will slowly resolve over 3 to 4 weeks [62], [64], [66]. The earliest manifestation of the second stage, early disseminated disease, can present as multiple secondary annular skin lesions within days to a few weeks after infection. These lesions can occur with the primary erythema chronicum migrans or not at all. If untreated they will resolve over days to weeks [64], [66]. Many patients will not recall a tick bite or an erythema migrans type lesion. These individuals' first indication of disease may come as early stage 2, manifesting as neurologic symptoms in the form of cranial nerve palsies, motor or sensory peripheral neuropathies, and even lymphocytic meningitis. This is followed by weakness and absent reflexes. Untreated, the acute neurologic symptoms will typically resolve within weeks or months [64], [66]. Approximately 6 months after infection, early disseminated disease may manifest as migratory and recurrent arthralgia, with periarticular pain or as frank arthritis of large joints (especially the knee) [63], [64], [66]. Cardiac involvement can present in varying degrees of atrioventricular block (first, second, or third). Unusually, cardiac symptoms can manifest in the form of myocarditis/pericarditis and congestive heart failure [63], [64], [66]. Often conduction defects are asymptomatic; any patient diagnosed with Lyme disease should have a screening electrocardiogram [66]. Stage 3, late Lyme disease, is characterized most commonly by chronic arthritis or neurologic system involvement [63], [64], [66]. They rarely occur concomitantly [66]. The arthritis is usually monoarticular, asymmetric, and confined to large joints (ie, knee). It may recur once or as multiple intermittent episodes over months to years [63], [64], [66]. Severity of the arthritis increases with age [66]. Most often there is no permanent joint damage and the process resolves over the course of several years; [62], [63], [66]; however, arthropathy or arthralgias may be persistent [66]. Late neurologic disease can manifest in the form of chronic encephalopathy with mild cognitive defects, sensory or motor neuropathies, and even leukoencephalopathies [63], [66].",

Neurologic disease should be treated with a 2- to 4-week course of parenteral antibiotics in the form of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Penicillin G may be a satisfactory alternative. Oral doxycycline is effective for the treatment of Lyme-associated facial palsy [64], [66]; however, diffuse neurologic disease may be present, and is better treated with parenteral antibiotics.[64] Lyme carditis, manifesting with atrioventricular (AV) node block (PR interval >0.3 second) should be treated with intravenous antibiotics and cardiac monitoring.

It is caused by the organism Rickettsia rickettsii and transmitted by two tick species in the United States: Dermacentor viriabilis (dog tick) in Eastern states and Dermacentor andersoni (wood tick) in Western states [63], [67]. In the United States, most infection occurs in the South Atlantic coastal states and the Midwestern states, with the greatest numbers of cases reported in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas, South Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia. There is a clear spring-to-summer distribution, with most cases occurring from April to September [67], [68]. The incidence is highest among children, with fatality rates being highest amongst individuals older than 40 and in males [63], [68]. Risk factors include exposure to dogs, residence in a wooded area, and male sex [63]. RMSF remains the most lethal of all the tick-borne disease in the United States, largely because of difficulty in early diagnosis [67], [68]. Infection results in involvement of endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels of the skin and internal organs, which causes a vasculitis [62], [68].",

            "text": "The incubation for RMSF averages about 7 days after the infecting tick bite [62], [68]. RMSF can present with the triad of rash, fever, and headache; however, the triad in combination with history of tick exposure is reported to occur in only 60% to 70% of confirmed cases [63], [68]. Retrospective studies have indicated that more than half of all patients in the early phases of RMSF were not recognized to be infected. Presentation within 3 days of onset of symptoms is associated with a longer delay in diagnosis than in patients who present after 3 days onset of symptoms [68]. Within 2 to 14 days following a tick bite, the illness will abruptly begin, with a combination of nonspecific symptoms including fever (usually 100% of cases), malaise, severe frontal headache, myalgias, and vomiting with or without abdominal pain [62], [63], [68]. Often the condition is misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis or an acute abdomen [63], [67]. Occasionally the patient may develop hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, mental confusion, meningismus, encephalitis, respiratory failure, renal dysfunction, coagulopathy, cardiac disturbances in the form of myocarditis or cardiac arrhythmia, and gastrointestinal bleeding during the course of the illness [63]. The rash will typically begin within the first week of infection in the form of blanching 1 to 4 mm macules that later become petechiae. Occasionally, RMSF may be spotless or almost spotless [67], [68]. Classically, the rash forms on the wrists and ankles and spreads centrally [62], [63], [68]; however, this textbook description is rarely observed. In many cases, the rash begins as a maculopapular exanthema, which then evolves into a petechial rash [68].",

If a tick is encountered, rapid removal lessens the chance for disease transmission. A tick should be lifted cleanly from the skin surface with a blunt forceps or tweezers by applying steady pressure and taking care not to crush or squeeze the body.

Urinary dipstick method of diagnosis is frequently used in the diagnosis of UTI because it is cheap, fast, and convenient. Dipstick sensitivity and specificity rise to 75% and 82%, respectively, when nitrite or leukocyte esterase are present [72]. Based on available data, it appears reasonable to empirically treat for UTI when the probability of infection is high, and reserve the above diagnostic tests for when the diagnosis is called into question [77]. A negative test result on dipstick or urinalysis, with a high pretest probability, cannot rule out infection. In this case, it is appropriate to obtain urine culture [72], [77]. Culture is also warranted when unusual organisms are suspected or when symptoms do not resolve within 2 to 4 weeks after treatment [72], [77].",

Before antibiotic selection, take into consideration recent antimicrobial use, recent hospitalization, and history of recurrent UTI infection. If the patient has not used trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the last 6 months and your community resistance patterns reveal less than 10% to 20% resistance to TMP-SMX, then double-strength TMP-SMX twice daily for 3 days is the drug of choice for uncomplicated cystitis [78]. In this scenario, it is estimated that TMP-SMX achieves bacteriologic cure within 7 days in 94% of women [72]. If the patient does not meet the above criteria or is allergic to TMP-SMX, a fluoroquinolone (3 days), nitrofurantonin (7 days), or fosfomycin (single-dose) should be used. For acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (no signs of systemic toxicity, able to self hydrate, and take oral medications) [72], fluoroquinolones are the treatment of choice. Repeated UTI in young women and adolescents should raise concern for possible STD [71].",

Ultrasound is useful to rule out testicular torsion if the diagnosis is in question based on history and physical examination [82]. If the patient's presentation reveals a short duration of pain with a correlating history and physical examination for torsion, the patient may be more appropriate for surgical exploration rather than delaying treatment for ultrasound examination. Any young male presenting with acute scrotal pain deserves prompt evaluation for testicular torsion. Epididymitis usually presents insidiously with increasing, dull, unilateral scrotal pain [79], [82]. Urinary tract symptoms including dysuria, frequency, and urgency may be present [82]. Once fully developed, the pain can be excruciating [79] and may extend up the spermatic cord and into the lower abdomen [79], [82]. Should infection spread into the testes, swelling and a reactive hydrocele can develop [79], [82]. The physical examination can reveal an erythematous, swollen, and tender epididymis or scrotum, depending on the spread of infection and time to presentation. The patient may be febrile [79], [82]. Urethral milking may reveal urethral discharge [79]. Patients often report relief of pain with elevation of the testicle, known as Prehn's sign. The cremasteric reflex is normally intact. None of these signs are specific for epididymitis, and their presence should warrant further investigation [82]. Urinalysis, urine culture, and urethral culture or urine DNA amplification for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be sent for laboratory evaluation. Urinalysis may reveal pyuria with bacteria present [79], [82]. White blood count may reveal a peripheral leukocytosis with a left shift [79].",

For men over the age of 35 years, treatment consists of an oral fluoroquinolone (ofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 10 days [83]. If the epididymitis is severe, parental antibiotics can be used.

Recent research has indicated that the prevalence of asymptomatic chlamydia in young adults age 18 to 26 is high. This increased prevalence reveals significant racial and ethnic disparities in both chlamydial and gonococcal infections [86]. The highest rates of chlamydia have been reported in the grouyp 15 to 24 years old. HIV/AIDS infection is the second leading cause of morbidity in the world, and is contracted most commonly by individuals aged 15 to 25. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted disease in the world. The CDC estimates that 50% to 75% of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives. It has also been estimated that 35% of teens and young adults in various Western countries have acquired HPV. Approximately 20% of the US adult population is infected with HSV, which is a 30% increase in the last 25 years [87]. The staggering reality associated with these statistics is that they belong to the very population that sports medicine specialists spend the majority of their time treating. STDs pose significant morbidity in regards to long-term sequelae of reproductive health in the form of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and continued painful genital lesions, which take significant tolls on physical and psychosexual health. In its severe form, STD can even impact mortality through death [87].",

Women older than 24 years of age should be screened if they are at risk for chlamydial infection (ie, new sexual partner or history of multiple partners) [83], [88]. Screening in the young adult population makes sense. Studies looking at screening for STDs during preparticipation sports examination found a prevalence in females for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea of 6.5% and 2.0%, respectively; and 2.8% and 0.7% in males, respectively. Of the individuals that were infected, 93.1% had no symptoms [89]. Studies in adolescents have documented short periods of time (4.7\u20137.6 months) until reinfection occurs, suggesting that sexually active adolescents should be screened every 6 months [90].",

The HBV-infected athlete represents a more distinct transmission risk, with a higher chance of blood exposure in contact sports. Therefore, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recommends removal of athletes who have acute HBV infection until loss of infectivity is known. Athletes who have chronic HBV infection should be withheld from contact sport indefinitely [92]. Obviously, when dealing with any blood exposure, universal precautions should be followed. Any contaminated surface should be decontaminated with approved disinfectants.",
