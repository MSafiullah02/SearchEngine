It can also be found in other species of birds including peafowl (Pavo spp.) and teal (Anas crecca) (Cavanagh, 2005). The virus is worldwide in distribution causing huge economic losses to the poultry industry that result from a reduction in feed conversion and weight gain, and condemnations at the processing plant (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Losses are also due to drops in egg production and poor egg quality in layer type chickens, and for some strains of the virus that are nephropathogenic extensive mortality can occur (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008).",

Genomic diversity and the ability of IBV to rapidly change have created different serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Consequently, attenuated live vaccines, used to control the disease, must be selected specifically for the serotype of IBV present in the flock. Compounding this situation is the presence of serologically different variant strains for which no vaccines exist.",

            "text": "We were interested in exploring alternative methods of controlling IBV that could potentially be effective across all serotypes. Antiviral compounds have been used to target proteins involved in coronaviral replication. Coronaviruses have a single stranded positive sense RNA genome that is approximately 27.5 kb in length for IBV. During coronavirus replication, a 3\u2032 nested set of subgenomic viral mRNAs are produced by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and four structural proteins are translated by this enveloped virus: spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Two large genes, 1a and 1ab from the genomic viral RNA encode the viral-replication complex. Those genes are translated into polyproteins that are processed by the main protease (Mpro) as well as a papain-like protease 2 (PL2) to form the viral polymerase and associated nonstructural proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2007). The main protease of coronaviruses appears to be the most attractive target for antiviral compounds (Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006, Niu et al., 2008, Xue et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2006). Inhibitors of Mpro include a Michael acceptor inhibitor (designated N3), chloromethyl ketones, epoxides, and AG7088 an inhibitor shown to be effective against the rhinovirus Mpro homolog (Anand et al., 2003, Niu et al., 2008, Xue et al., 2008). Other antiviral compounds like hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) target ion channel conductance, and have been shown to have an antiviral effect against human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) coronavirus in vitro (Wilson et al., 2006). In addition, specific inhibition of IBV has been reported in vitro using lithium chloride (Harrison et al., 2007). However, lithium chloride is a toxin and its usefulness as an antiviral against IBV in vivo remains to be determined.",

            "text": "A major problem surrounding antiviral compounds targeting specific viral genes or proteins is the ability of the virus to rapidly mutate during replication to become resistant. Some examples include acyclovir resistant human immunodeficiency viruses and herpes simplex viruses (McMahon et al., 2008), oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses (Collins et al., 2008), and nucleoside/nucleotide analog resistant hepatitis B viruses (Delaney and Borroto-Esoda, 2008). Alternatively, compounds that have a virucidal effect work like a disinfectant, and do not require replication to inactivate the virus (Reichling et al., 2005, Schuhmacher et al., 2003). Thus, resistance to virucidal compounds due to mutations generated in the viral genome during replication is unlikely (Schnitzler et al., 2007). Virucidal activity of essential oils from botanicals has been reported for a number of viruses including herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, and Junin virus (Duschatzky et al., 2005, Koch et al., 2008, Schnitzler et al., 2007). Virucidal activity of essential oils, which are lipophilic by nature, is probably due to disruption of the viral membrane or interference with viral envelope proteins involved in host cell attachment. Although selection of resistant mutants is possible, it has been reported that inactivation of virus by lipophilic essential oils is time dependent and that infectious virus remaining after treatment are still sensitive to the essential oils making selection of resistant mutants unlikely (Schnitzler et al., 2007).",

Both positive and negative control groups were included in the in vivo studies however; we did not include a diluent control group because, in the first experiment, the diluent was shown not to have an effect on the virus titer. Based on clinical signs, lesions and virus detection, the best routes of administration were determined to be intranasal and spray inoculation 2 h before challenge. In addition, it appears treatment intranasally or by spray 2 h after challenge was somewhat better than intranasal or spray treatment at 6 h before challenge. Administration of QR448(a) by water had little effect regardless of treatment timing. Based on microscopic lesions, it appears that QR448(a) alone does not adversely affect the epithelium of the trachea. It is interesting that we could not detect virus in some of the groups treated intranasally or by spray in this experiment. It appears that QR448(a) reduced the titer of IBV below an infectious threshold. Infection often does not occur when birds are challenged with \u22641 \u00d7 102.5 EID50 of the Mass41 strain of IBV (Jackwood, unpublished data). It is also possible that inhibitors to the real-time RT-PCR reaction prevented detection; however, we were able to detect challenge virus in the other groups suggesting the presence of inhibitors are inconsistent or that another explanation is likely. Since spray is suitable for mass application of commercial chickens, we used that route of administration to examine the minimum effective dose, duration of activity, and effect on transmission of IBV in chickens.",

Protection from infection was not observed since challenge virus was detected in all of the QR448(a) treated and challenged birds. However, at all but two challenge times (4 and 12 h) the amount of challenge virus in the trachea was slightly lower in the QR448(a) treated groups but the values were not statistically significant.

Vaccine virus was used in this experiment because colony houses (necessary to house the number of birds needed for the experiment) are not biologically secure, preventing us from using pathogenic isolates of IBV. Although this experiment was designed to be a model for the prevention of spread of pathogenic IBV isolates, the data directly address an extremely important problem of Arkansas vaccine virus persistence in commercial broiler flocks. Persistence of IBV in a flock can cause a severe vaccine reaction and provides opportunity for the vaccine virus to mutate and revert to pathogenicity as well as change antigenically avoiding the immune response of the bird. A reduction in transmission afforded by treatment with QR448(a) is extremely important since it will limit IBV transmission in the flock, and likely lessen or even prevent persistence of Arkansas vaccine virus in flocks. Since QR448(a) is effective against the pathogenic Mass41 strain of IBV it is expected that it will also limit transmission of pathogenic field strains of IBV in commercial broilers and thereby decrease the severity of the disease.",

            "text": "This is the first report on the use of a mixture of all natural ingredients, specifically botanical oleoresins and essential oils, as a control measure for IBV. Mass delivery of QR448(a) by spray is compatible with application in a commercial setting and it is effective against both Mass and Ark type IB viruses, indicating that it ought to be effective against IBV regardless of serotype. The effect appears to be more pronounced on cell free virus indicating that the activity is likely virucidal, which is important because it may also be effective against other enveloped respiratory viruses like avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus in commercial poultry, as well as other coronaviruses in animals and humans. In addition, since virucidal compounds work by inactivating viruses, rather than targeting specific virus genes or proteins, it reduces the likelihood that resistance will develop from mutations during virus replication.",
