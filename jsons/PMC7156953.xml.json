It is challenging to estimate global research and development expenditures and compare those results across countries. The two major issues are obtaining health care data from each country and using a common currency conversion over time (Young et al, 2015). Despite these important challenges, Chakma et al (2014) made a legitimate effort to do just that, sourcing data from global biomedical agencies, governments and statistical bureaus and rendering those data into US dollars for legitimate comparisons. According to this analysis, in 2012 the USA spent the most on health care research, amounting to US $48.9 billion by public institutions and US $70.4 billion by private industry. The whole of Europe spent US $81.8 billion. All of the countries in Asia-Oceania spent half the amount of the USA, amounting to US $62 billion with 70% of that provided by private industry. Of all the Asia-Oceania countries, the largest investment in health care R&D between 2007 and 2012 was made by Japan, amounting to US $202.2 billion. Australia, China and South Korea each spent between US $26 to US $32 billion. But the story line was not how much biomedical R&D was invested by Asia-Oceania countries. Instead, the take-home point was the trend in their expenditures over time.",

In contrast, Japan increased its spending by US $9 billion, amounting to a 5.7% increase.

These estimates have been revised somewhat (Young et al, 2015), but the broad conclusion remains the same: investment in biomedical research increased at a faster pace in Asia-Oceania than in the United States as well as Canada and Europe.

There was an increase in competition among countries for recruiting and retaining the best biomedical research talent. This increase in health spending meant more opportunities for Asian-Oceanian scientists to return home to their native country to work and prosper. And, after they returned, many developed productive collaborative research programs with Western scientists where they received their advanced training. It also meant that graduate students, post-docs and professors from countries outside of Asian-Oceania had more employment opportunities in foreign countries. Stated simply, increased funding for biomedical R&D in Asia increased opportunities not only for Asian-Pacific investigators but for scientists around the entire world. The end product has been simply the result of supply and demand. The beneficiaries of this greater investment in biomedical R&D in the entire Asia-Pacific region were not only the investigators but all of us because of the biomedical discoveries that they produced.",

This development challenges two key features of biomedical research: openness in sharing data and global collaboration. And, this umbrage might spread to all countries in Asia-Oceania. As highlighted by the current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2, this is a time when biomedical scientists and pharmaceutical companies around the world are working together to find both treatments and a vaccine for this very contagious coronavirus (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick, 2020). Indeed, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, Elias Zerhouni, pointed to the substantial contributions of foreign-national scientists. He noted that foreign nationals have contributed greatly to both patents and scientific discoveries in the USA. He wrote, \u201cNo members of any community should be targeted because of their origins\u2026.The United States should not risk losing critical intellectual assets such as productive foreign-born scientists and engineers to global competitors\u2026\u201d (Zerhouni, 2019). This cautionary message was more recently reiterated by the editorial staff of the leading journal, Biological Psychiatry: \u201cThe mission of Biological Psychiatry is to publish impactful scientific communications. To further that mission, we promote diversity in all aspects of the publication process, including authorship, reviewing, and editing. Our diversity efforts aim to increase participation among individuals of underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender identities; from underrepresented countries or disadvantaged backgrounds; and those with disabilities.\u201d (Leibenluft, 2020).",

However, as noted above, that focus changed dramatically early in the 21st century. The Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society (PNIRS) is a global non-profit society that was formed in 1993. Its primary goal is to promote the study of interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationship between behavior and health. PNIRS has a rich history of promoting basic research that can be translated to the clinic (Kelley and McCusker, 2014, Kelley, 2020), and this extends to Asia. As early as 2002, Christopher Coe, Ph.D., organized a symposium at the annual PNIRS meeting that was held in Madison, Wisconsin. The speakers discussed both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Tai chi (Anonymous, 2002). Ten years later, the society \u201cgot ahead of the curve\u201d by recognizing the growing importance of biomedical research in China by forming the Chinese branch of PNIRS, designated PNIRSChina, as its official regional affiliate in that country. This PNIRSChina affiliate began by serendipity.",

As such, she recommended that Professor Peng invite the then Editor-in-Chief of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Professor Kelley readily accepted the ensuing invitation from Professor Peng to lecture in Nantong. He went on to lecture in Dalian and Beijing. During that trip, lots of brainstorming occurred about the idea of forming liaisons between China, Brain, Behavior, and Immunity and PNIRS (Fig. 1\n). The possibility of creating an Eastern affiliate like PNIRSChina, as had previously been done in the West with Germany (German-Endocrine-Brain-Immune-Network (GEBIN; Anonymous, 1997), was considered.",

The practice of TCM has been, and continues to be, used by billions of people in the Sinosphere. The essence of TCM is the balance of body and mind (Fig. 2\n), which is considered to be linked by communication between the brain, neuroendocrine and immune systems. Professor Cobol Su, M.D., Ph.D., at the China Medical University in Taiwan recently eloquently summarized this concept with a simple sentence: \u201cPsychoneuroimmunology has been long stemmed in ancient medicine (Su, 2019).\u201d As such, it seemed logical to develop a plan that would establish more formal relationships with Chinese scientists. This would not only promote a better understanding of psychoneuroimmunology but also serve to contribute to improvement of world\u2010wide health care. Furthermore, sharing Western science with Chinese investigators made sense in order to articulate and better understand if and how TCM aligns with Western scientific principles (Anonymous, 2007). Perhaps the PNIRS affiliate of China would promote development of knowledge about mind-body techniques practiced in other Eastern countries like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.",

Dalian Medical University was one of the first universities in China to focus on Clinical Integrative Medicine. This is a curriculum that combines teaching, practice and research in both traditional and western medicine. Following creation of PNIRSChina, Professor Liu moved quickly to establish and organize the first official meeting of this new PNIRS affiliate (Anonymous, 2016). The participating organizations were Dalian Medical University, Nantong University, Jining Medical University and Sun Yat\u2010sen University. Importantly, Professor Liu enlisted the input of Bo Bai, M.D., Ph.D., the president of Jining Medical University. This academic forum was held in conjunction with the Dalian Psychoneuroimmunology Medical Society. A broad goal was developed that aimed to embrace, learn and share knowledge about psychoneuroimmunology with Chinese colleagues. At the opening ceremony of the first PNIRSChina meeting on April 23, 2013, Professor Liu outlined three specific goals for the new PNIRS affiliate: (1) Conduct basic research that can be translated into clinically relevant health applications; (2) Promote the growth of interrelationships among scientists of different scientific and medical disciplines; and (3) Build a platform of academic communication for researchers engaged in psychoneuroimmunology research and teaching. The PNIRSChina affiliate would help scientists in China develop an international perspective, to identify and cultivate emerging outstanding young investigators and organize academic forums and experience exchanges among laboratories. Professor Kelley, other scientists and university leaders made presentations during the ceremony. This 2013 meeting was well-attended with 250 registrants. Professor Liu formally presented Professor Kelley with a plaque recognizing the formal creation of PNIRSChina (Fig. 4\n). Professor Liu extended the opening of PNIRSChina by organizing meetings at Jining Medical University and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. The integrative aspects of psychoneuroimmunology research were emphasized at all these meetings. Indeed, the call for expanding the knowledge of integrative medicine in continuing medical education programs, as assessed by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, has recently been highlighted (Ring et al., 2020).",

This committee aimed to organize symposia and other outreach approaches that would embrace, learn and share knowledge about psychoneuroimmunology with Chinese colleagues. The approach used was simple and cost-effective. Leading psychoneuroimmunology scholars from around the world were invited to participate in symposia submissions to major scientific meetings held in mainland China. Even though no travel funds were available to support expenses, nearly all of the invited experts willingly agreed to pay their own travel. Since the formal opening ceremony in Dalian, there have been six more PNIRSAsia-Pacific\u2013sponsored symposia in Shanghai, Wuzhen, Beijing, Zhanjiang, Tianjin and Nanchang (Fig. 5\n). A summary of the scientific content, as well as the names and photos of all the speakers, is available online at the PNIRS home page (https://pnirs.org/pnirschina/index.cfm). Each of these meetings attracted around 120 scientists or more. The audience was actively engaged, as assessed by both the number and quality of questions. It was clear to the organizers and speakers that Chinese scientists were interested in learning more about psychoneuroimmunology, PNIRS and Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.",

Today, more and more Chinese scientists recognize the significance of neuroimmunology and psychoneuroimmunology research in human health and disease therapy and are being attracted to this research field. The establishment of PNIRSChina in 2013 was a hallmark development that is already rapidly promoting psychoneuroimmunology research in China. By using data from the official scientific journal of PNIRS, this fact is made clear (Fig. 7\nA). Prior to 2016, there were fewer than 100 papers per year submitted to Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Now, research papers submitted by mainland scientists to this journal amount to nearly 400 per year. More importantly, the quality of these papers has increased substantially, as assessed by the rapid rise in scientific citations. It is also clear that during the past five years, Chinese scientists have greatly increased their collaborative research efforts with laboratories outside of the mainland, which now includes the United States, all of Europe and Australia (Fig. 7B).",

            "text": "During this decade, most studies on psychoneuroimmunology in China have focused on interactions between immune disorders mediated by microglia and nervous system diseases. Excessive microglial activation is involved in the pathogenesis of many mental health and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including stress, depression, ischemic or traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. In turn, psychological and CNS disorders often cause microglial activation. Inhibition of microglial excessive activation or promotion of microglial polarization from an M1-like towards an M2-like phenotype may help to alleviate some of these disorders. Several relevant studies from China on these topics have been published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.1.Microglia and stress, depression and psychological disorders. Microglial activation is involved in stress-induced depressive behavior (Lian et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018). Importantly, anti-depressive treatment can be implemented by modulation of microglial phenotypes (Zhang et al., 2017).2.Microglia and ischemic or traumatic brain injury. Nitidine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, restricts reactive microgliosis and promotes CNS repair following traumatic injury (Yuan et al., 2015). Suppression of microglial activation by let-7c-5p overexpression is neuroprotective and ameliorates ischemic damage (Ni et al., 2015). Specific deletion of the protein kinase MST1 in microglia mitigates stroke-induced brain injury (Zhao et al., 2016).3.Microglia and neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 promotes microglial polarization from an M1-like towards an M2-like phenotype and thereby reduces neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and ameliorates its development (Xu et al., 2019). Trans-cinnamaldehyde, a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, suppresses neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. This reduces memory deficits in mice with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Zhao et al., 2019). Gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and fecal microbiota transplantation can protect affected mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-\u03b1 signaling in microglia (Sun et al., 2018). Galectin-1 reduces neurodegeneration in a Parkinson\u2019s disease model by modulating the microglial MAPK/I\u03baB/NF\u03baB axis (Li et al., 2020). It is important to note that the triptolide (T10), a Chinese herb, protects against neurotoxicity in Parkinson\u2019s disease by inhibiting microglial activation with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 mediating its effect (Huang et al., 2018). Thus, as was highlighted by Nobel Laurate Professor Tu Youyou, exploring more Chinese herbs and their mechanisms underlying suppression of microglial activation provide an opportunity for Chinese scientists to develop novel therapeutic strategies for targeted psychological and CNS diseases.\n",

            "text": "In addition to microglial involvement in nervous system disorders, recent evidence has established that the adaptive immune system, particularly T lymphocytes, participates in the processes of neuronal injury and repair. Helper T (Th)17 cells, a subset of CD4+ T lymphocytes, have strong pro-inflammatory properties and are essential in pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, the Foxp3-expressing CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte population, were originally termed \u201csuppressor cells\u201d and are pivotal in suppressing autoimmunity and maintaining immune tolerance. Some findings from China on this important topic have also been published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.4.T cells and neurodegenerative diseases. Th17 cells infiltrate the brain parenchyma in Parkinson\u2019s disease through a lesioned brain-blood barrier and cause neurotoxicity by both promoting glial activation and directly injuring neurons. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17A released from Th17 cells accelerates this neurodegeneration in models of Parkinson\u2019s disease, depending on microglial activation. Supporting this conclusion is the fact that IL-17A deficiency or anti-IL-17A-neutralizing antibody treatment alleviates microglial activation, blood\u2013brain-barrier disruption and Parkinson\u2019s disease-like manifestations (Liu et al., 2019). On the other hand, Treg cells protect dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) neurotoxicity by a cell-to-cell contact mechanism. TGF-\u03b21 secreted by Treg cells exerts an indirect protective effect by inhibiting excessive microglial activation (Liu et al., 2016).5.T cells are involved in brain injury of cerebral ischemia and stroke. Cerebral ischemia increases the number of Treg cells in the bone marrow of mice, which contributes to stroke-induced immunosuppression (Wang et al., 2015). The FasL mutation inhibits both recruitment of peripheral inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and activation of resident glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), and drives the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2 in the brain and peripheral blood following cerebral ischemia (Niu et al., 2012).6.T cells also infiltrate the spinal cord with an imbalance of Th17/Treg towards Th17 during the development of bone cancer pain. In turn, this promotes microglial activation and further increases pain, while neutralizing IL-17/IL-17A in the spinal cord ameliorates bone cancer pain (Huo et al., 2019). In addition to the Th17/Treg imbalance, a Th1/Th2 imbalance also occurs in the brain and peripheral blood following cerebral ischemia (Niu et al., 2012). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 derived from Th2 cells may alleviate neuropathic pain and contribute to other neuropsychiatric disorders (Nie et al., 2018). Thus, blocking proinflammatory immune responses or applying anti-inflammatory cytokines may offer a potential and novel therapeutic strategy for some psychological and nervous system diseases.\n",

Unfortunately, biomedical research, particularly psychoneuroimmunology medicine, is underdeveloped in this region. This could be due to barriers of communication, differences in medical theories and diagnostic systems, lack of a common ground for clinical research design or cultural differences. Indeed, psychopathology manifestations are sensitive to cultural influences (Guinart et al, 2019). Furthermore, immunological status is arguably different regarding significant backgrounds of genomic constitution, dietary patterns and life styles. It is therefore strongly urged that more exploratory, rather than replicated, translational brain research from the East be valued and promoted. This approach is needed to turn empirical practices into precision medicine that is based on innovative and integrative science (Su, 2019).",

According to data available for Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, there have been 33 published papers by authors from Taiwan during the past 33 years (Fig. 6). Remarkably, 13 were published in the past two years, supporting the conclusion that translational brain-immune research is rising. In 2017, Professor Keith W. Kelley from the PNIRS was invited as the plenary keynote speaker at the Mind-Body Interface (MBI) International Symposium held in Taiwan. With a mutual interest and a common and achievable goal, this led to an affiliate of PNIRS, PNIRSAsia-Pacific, to propose co-organizing future MBI Symposium. The MBI and PNIRSAsia-Pacific teams have been working together since then. In 2018, Professors Keith Kelley, Chris Coe and Carmine Pariante called for a dozen PNIRS scholars to propose a thematic session for the forthcoming MBI symposium. It was here that the entire organization of PNIRS and Brain, Behavior, and Immunity was officially introduced and promoted to scientists in Taiwan. The following year, Professor Deborah Hodgson and another 10 PNIRS scholars presented a PNIRSAsia-Pacific symposium at the 2019 MBI meeting. The next MBI meeting is scheduled to be held in October 2020, and the theme is \u201cThe Mind Maze \u2013 Early Life Experiences That Shape Adult Health of Mind and Body.\u201d With the support from President Julie Bower and the PNIRSAsia-Pacific affiliate, Michael Irwin, M.D. has been chosen to be the plenary keynote speaker at this 2020 MBI Symposium.

However, the current psychiatric classification system, DSM-V, is not sufficient for clinical studies on mental disorders despite its feasibility for health care practitioners (Chang et al., 2014). Furthermore, there is a fundamental difference in theory between Western and Eastern medicine. Eastern medicine views mind-and-body as inseparable as a meridian system rather than an anatomical structure. Practices include dietary intervention, herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage, meditation or Tai chi. These treatments aim to bring harmony and alignment back to the mind-and-body as a whole. The benefits of this holistic approach is gaining attention nowadays with robust findings from biomedical research. However, the therapeutic effect of one single life-style intervention is expected to be much smaller and difficult to detect than that with an expensive randomized controlled trial. This is the gold standard for examining the effects of treatments such as anti-depressants on subjects with confirmed diagnoses like major depressive disorders (Su, 2019). It is therefore crucial to advocate for translational brain research in the East with good practices in clinical trials using advanced science. As but one example, new technologies of wearable devices for continuous data collection of brain activities can now be used and summarized with algorithms for these types of big data.",

            "text": "Australia has had a strong niche role in psychoneuroimmunology research from the beginning of the field. The very first edition of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, published in 1987 carried an article by Professor Kusnecov and colleagues, which has since been cited 64 times. In this work, the authors revealed a role for \u03b2-endorphin in enhancing lymphocyte reactivity to concanavalin A (Kusnecov et al, 1987). At that time, publications in the journal were dominated by laboratories from the United States (5 articles of the 10 in the first issue). Since then, psychoneuroimmunology research in Australia has gone from strength to strength (Fig. 8\nA), with a particular boost in 2017 when the PNIRSChina initiative was broadened to encompass the rest of Asia and the Pacific. Australians now have the 6th most submissions to Brain, Behavior, and Immunity annually, after the United States, China, Brazil, Germany and the United Kingdom (data for 2017 courtesy of Elsevier). These publications are at least as high quality and impactful as those from other countries. The most recent data published in Nature Index noted that between 2017 and 2018, contributions of Australian scientists to the highest quality journals in the life sciences increased by 8.2% (Anonymous, 2020). Australia now contributes approximately the fourth most published articles in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (after the United States, China, United Kingdom and equal to Canada). In 2019, 16 papers were published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity with Australian first or senior authors. An additional four had Australian collaborators and at least ten employed diverse internationally collaborative research teams. Importantly, many of those articles are examples of the truly global nature of current psychoneuroimmunology research. Several featured upwards of five nations in the author list, integrating technologies, ideas, personnel and student experiences towards research outcomes that could not be achieved by one group alone (Fig. 8B). These papers covered such diverse research topics as chlamydia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Woods et al, 2020) to microglial morphology in post-traumatic stress disorder (Smith et al., 2019) to aging and traumatic brain injury (Sun et al, 2019).",

The few years since the 2017 incorporation of Australia along with the rest of Asia and the Pacific region into the PNIRSAsia-Pacific affiliation have also witnessed an explosion of internationally collaborative meetings and symposia showcasing Australian psychoneuroimmunology research. Professor Mark Hutchinson organized a symposium in Sydney in 2014. Three years later, Professor Hutchinson teamed with Dr. Luba Sominsky to organize a psychoneuroimmunology satellite workshop to Australia\u2019s premiere neuroscience meeting, the Australasian Neuroscience Conference. The 2019 International Brain Research Organization showcased key Australian elements of the PNIRSAsia-Pacific initiative, along with Professor Suzi Hong from the Pacific side of the United States at their meeting in Daegu, South Korea. In 2019, there was also a PNIRSAsia-Pacific symposium integrated into the Queenstown Winter Conference on Brain Research week in Queenstown, New Zealand. This symposium highlighted research from investigators with experience from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States and amply illustrates how far the PNIRS has now come as a global scientific community.",

            "text": "Going forward into 2020 and beyond, we expect to witness even more globalization, integration and transdisciplinary psychoneuroimmunology research incorporating Australia and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. However, we also expect to see psychoneuroimmunology research becoming more specialized to embrace the specific psychoneuroimmunology needs of different international communities. For instance, the psychoneuroimmunology consequences of endemic diseases like malaria or dengue might be of key relevance for South-East Asia. China may benefit from an individualized response to novel coronaviruses. Australia and the United States are now investing heavily in space exploration, making psychoneuroimmunology research important in this context for these countries. Air pollution may have important psychoneuroimmunology implications all over the world, but the types of pollution may differ. On the other hand, historically different approaches to our understanding of psychoneuroimmunology among different communities worldwide may bring important advances to all of us. The holistic integration of body and mind that is the cornerstone of traditional medicine in China is revolutionizing Western medicine and popular approaches. Likewise, the strong social support networks of indigenous communities have key implications for stress and mental health management for everyone. Thus, globalizing psychoneuroimmunology research does not just mean more of the same in new countries, but a true advance in our approach to understanding how the world we live in affects our brains and bodies.",

            "text": "For the period between 1987 and the end of 2019, there were 92 papers published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity with a primary corresponding author from Japan (Fig. 6). This placed Japan as the 13th country in the world with the highest number of publications in the journal. In addition, there were 231 Japanese authors that contributed to papers. The number of Japanese members in PNIRS is only four at the present time. Although these data might make it appear as though Japanese investigators do not have a strong interest in psychoneuroimmunology, a growing number of Japanese scientists are performing research related to this field. The Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology was established in 1988 by physicians who specialize in intractable neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and the paraneoplastic syndrome. These physicians are interested not only in clinical treatments, but also in the basic mechanisms underlying the interactions between the nervous and immune systems. When PNIRSAsia-Pacific organized a symposium for the first time in Japan at the 2019 annual meeting of the Japan Neuroscience Society, the Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology published a record of this symposium in its official journal (Shimada, 2020, Pal et al., 2020, Kelley and Shimada, 2020). Collaborations between the executive board members of the society and PNIRSAsia-Pacific are currently in the works, and the Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology and PNIRSAsia-Pacific hope to hold joint symposia in the near future. In addition, the National Institute of Neuroscience at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry has one of the most active laboratories that perform research related to neuroimmunology and neuroinflammation (Yamamura et al, 2019).",

            "text": "In the history of modern immunology, Japanese immunologists have made outstanding achievements using molecular biological techniques to elucidate the fundamental principles of immunology. The most recent example is from the famous laboratory of Tadamitsu Kishimoto, M.D., from Osaka University. His life work led to development of a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (Kishimoto, 2005). This antibody, known as tocilizumab, is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Because of its immunosuppressive properties that inhibit the cytokine storm, it has recently been approved for late stage clinical trials in both China and the USA as treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Professor Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1987 for his work showing that genetic material rearranges itself to form millions of different antibodies (Tonegawa, 1983). His discovery revealed the mechanism of the adaptive immune system, which had been the central question of immunology for over 100 years. Professor Tasuku Honjo established the basic conceptual framework of class switch recombination through his discovery of DNA deletion (Honjo and Kataoka, 1978) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Muramatsu et al, 2000). Other leading Japanese immunologists have also contributed to the identification of cytokines, their receptors and signaling pathways, including interferon \u03b1, interferon \u03b2, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-18, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL12, CXCR4, Fas receptor and Fas ligand (Kumanogoh and Ogata, 2000 for a review). The contributions of Japanese research to the field of innate immunity include identification of ligands for most of the Toll-like receptors (Akira and Takeda, 2004). Professor Honjo was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018 for his discovery of program cell death 1 (PD-1), a negative co-receptor of the effector phase of the immune response. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is now approved in the United States, European Union and Japan, and it has revolutionized the treatments for cancer (Chowdhury et al, 2018). PD-1 could also be a novel key molecule in psychoneuroimmunology. Augmented T cell responses in Pdcd1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack the inhibitory receptor PD-1, induce a systemic decrease in tryptophan and tyrosine levels. This leads to a substantial deficiency in brain serotonin and dopamine, resulting in anxiety-like behavior and exacerbated fear responses (Miyajima et al, 2017).",

The SAMP10 mouse strain exhibits microglial dystrophy from a young age and lacks the ability to construct a neuroprotective cytokine-mediated glia-neuronal network. This causes the mice to be vulnerable to age-related cognitive impairments (Hasegawa-Ishii et al, 2011).
