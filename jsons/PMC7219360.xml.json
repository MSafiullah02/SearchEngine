Originally the masks were not devised to be worn all day, but now in wake of COVID-19 pandemic, duration of masks use has increased. Using mask has become both necessity and legal boundation.3 Because of a sudden surge in demand and low availability of masks, new standard operating procedure (SOP) regarding their use have been formulated.4 These guidelines recommend an increase in duration and reusing the masks. However, there are several issues experienced by the present style of putting on the masks which are1)Prolonged pressure over ears causing erythematous and painful changes (Fig. 4).2)Constant irritation at back of ear while wearing the mask.3)Decrease in compliance, thereby lowering the preventive measures.4)Inadvertent urge to touch the mask, face and ears to relieve the soreness and irritation. This increases the risk of acquiring and spreading virus.\n",
