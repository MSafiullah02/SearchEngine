Therefore, early pulmonary rehabilitation is important in these patients. We would like to share our experience of early pulmonary rehabilitation program in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.",

Postural change and prone position probably improves gas exchange and reduces the incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia by enhancing drainage of secretions. With good cooperation and assistance from medical staff, the patient underwent prone-position ventilation when conscious. 2. Respiratory training to restore respiratory muscle strength and lung volume. Acute-phase ARDS-associated alveolar collapse and inflammation leads to pulmonary volume reduction. 2 The chronic phase of ARDS may be characterized by pulmonary fibroproliferation, which also leads to diminished lung compliance. 3 The patient was trained to undertake spontaneous deep breathing to maintain lung recruitment. An inspiratory volumetric exerciser was used to train the respiratory muscle strength. 3. Early mobilization and physical exercises. Early mobilization helped avoid ICU-acquired weakness, and was aimed at improving respiratory and diaphragmatic muscle strength and promoting recovery of respiratory function. 4 The patient started exercising from exercise on the bed, to sit on a chair, to assisted walking, and eventually to self-walking. 4. Psychological intervention and sleep promotion. The medical staffs continued to communicate with the patient, and psychological counselling was telephonically conducted, which helped alleviate the patient's anxiety and depression. Sleep-promoting measures, including earplugs, eyeshades, relaxing music, and some sleeping medication were used to improve night sleep.",
