The inventory of viral species has increased exponentially in recent decades with the advent of new research tools such as molecular tests and massive parallel sequencing (e.g. metagenomics, Zhang, Shi, et al., 2018). According to the latest review by The International Committee on Taxonomy on Viruses (Lefkowitz et al., 2017), a total of 4,843 species of viruses have been recognized. However, estimations show more than 1.6 millions of mammalian and waterfowl viruses in 25 families that can cause human infections (Carroll et al., 2018). To now, approximately 75% of all known species infect eukaryotic cells, and only 164 viral species are considered as zoonotic species (Taylor, Latham, & Woolhouse, 2001).",

Given our close contact with mammalian groups such as rodents, bats and ungulates, we can assume that many of these viral pathogens recorded in wildlife populations can come into contact and spread into human populations under particular circumstances. Some examples of this include SARS [Severe acute respiratory syndrome] (Chan & Chan, 2013), hantavirus (Byers, 2018) and rabies (Begeman et al., 2018).",

We followed Wheeler, Worden, and McLean (2016) and implemented a random relabelling permutation approach of the cross\u2010K function. This method allows us to test whether there is a spatial patterning or association between wild mammal virus records and human viral cases. The cross\u2010K function is the bivariate version of Ripley's K function and can be used to characterize point patterns and determine whether they are clustered, dispersed or randomly distributed (Dixon, 2002). To test co\u2010distribution under a realistic null hypothesis, we kept the point locations fixed, but randomly assigned each one to be either a wild mammal viral record or a human case under the same marginal frequencies. This test is appropriate for instances in which sampling is biased or uneven (Wheeler et al., 2016). We called functions from the R packages spatstat (Baddeley, Turner, & Rubak, 2018), sp (Pebesma et al., 2018) and rgdal (Bivand et al., 2018) to run this test.",

The states with the lowest rate were Quintana Roo (1.21), Oaxaca (1.04) and Nayarit (1.03). Meanwhile, the states with no reports were Quer\u00e9taro, Tabasco and Tlaxcala (Figures 4 and 6a; Table S3).

The states with the lowest number of potential zoonotic viral species correspond to those with the fewest records (Aguascalientes, Nayarit and Quintana Roo), with only one viral species recorded. The geographic distribution of studies and records does not follow known patterns of research effort related to species diversity nor species richness. Other abiotic factors may be involved, such as population size, funds and the number of research centres. For example, Mexico City is not particularly rich in mammals, but it is the capital and the venue for several major research institutions and other public health infrastructure (e.g. the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos [InDRE]). The reasons for the high incidence rate in wild mammal\u2010associated virus research records for Baja California Sur could be the low mammalian diversity related to its area, and the bias as a result of the very high sampling and capture effort made in the respective works, as in the case of Coahuila (see Colunga\u2010Salas et al., 2019).",

Additionally, there are fundamental differences in how human cases and wildlife records are reported and sampled spatially. Despite known roadside bias in wild mammal sampling, wild mammal records are more likely to come from less urbanized landscapes than reports for human cases, which are tied more closely with health infrastructure in or close to human settlements. Our method for testing co\u2010distribution accounts for distance and could potentially overcome these biases, but larger\u2010scale simulation\u2010based studies may be needed to accurately measure the sensitivity of this approach to sampling biases.",

Clearly, more information on zoonotic virus infections is necessary to improve clinical diagnosis and health services in Mexico. It is noteworthy that at least 42 of the 164 (25.6%) species of zoonotic virus reported worldwide are circulating in mammals in the country. It is noteworthy that at least, in human viral cases, only 17% (33/199) were diagnosed showing the aetiological agent (Table S1) (CENAVECE, 2013).
