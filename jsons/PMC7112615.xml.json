            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a serious and extremely contagious enteric infection that causes extensive death in sucking piglets, thereby having a major adverse economic impact on the global swine industry (Pensaert and Martelli, 2016). PED was first identified in the 1970s in England, but it has become more prominent and lethal in Asia over the past decade, devastating local economies (Wood, 1977; Zhou et al., 2012). This disease is caused by the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Lee, 2015). This virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with an envelope and a 28,000 bp genome encoding a total of 7 known open reading frames (ORFs): replicase polyproteins 1a and 1b, ORF3, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Duarte et al., 1993). Accumulated evidence indicates that PEDV could manipulate the immune responses of its hosts to benefit its own replication. Sun et al. reported that the CH/SXYL/2016 strain of PEDV could cause cell cycle arrest in Vero cells at the G0/G1 phase, and synchronization of the cells at the G0/G1 phase could increase the proportion of infected cells (Sun et al., 2018); the same results were also observed in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-infected PK-15 cells (Ding et al., 2013). In addition, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that viruses encode defensive mechanisms to evade the antiviral activities of host cells (Xing et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018). However, hosts have many mechanisms aimed at detecting and disrupting PEDV replication and spread (Cao et al., 2015; Kong et al., 2016). An improved understanding of how this pathogen interacts with the host immune system is required to enhance efforts to control PEDV spread and to develop efficacious PEDV vaccines.",

            "text": "Many aspects of the viral life cycle can be mediated through a variety of cellular defense mechanisms (Katze et al., 2002). p53, the best studied tumor suppressor gene (Oren, 2003), has been shown to play different roles in virus replication (Dharel et al., 2008; Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2011); upon viral infection, cells could activate the p53 signaling pathway to cause different cell fate (Ding et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2013; Purvis et al., 2012). p53 is also activated in other stressful contexts, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, altered metabolism, and oncogene activation (Vousden and Lu, 2002; Zhang et al., 2011). Induction of p53 can trigger responses such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or even cell death (Sherr, 2004; Vogelstein et al., 2000). p53 is hence termed the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d. p53 has now also been described as a central regulator of the innate immune response (Rivas et al., 2010). It was also reported that p53 can activate ISGs, thereby giving it the ability to amplify the intracellular interferon (IFN) response (Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2011; Takaoka et al., 2003). However, exactly what if any role is played by p53 during PEDV infection is unknown. In this study, we reveal that there is a direct role for p53 in mediating host innate immune responses to PEDV infection.",

Vero cells are the most common cell line used to study PEDV infection (Jarvis et al., 2016). Vero cells, however, do not produce type I IFN when infected with viruses due to loss of the type I IFN gene cluster (Desmyter et al., 1968; Emeny and Morgan, 1979). As such, Vero cells are a poor model of innate antiviral immunity, leading us to use HEK293 cells to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to PEDV.",

SgRNA158 and sgRNA334 were targeted to the N-terminal domain of p53 (Fig. 2\nA). GFP-positive cells were selected by FACS sorting and were propagated prior to Western blot analysis. The sgRNA334 clone showed complete p53 deletion, but the clone generated by sgRNA158 did not decrease p53 expression (Fig. 2B). Thus, the clone generated by sgRNA334 was used to investigate the influence of p53 on PEDV replication. The cell growth and viability of p53 knock-out cells were indistinguishable from those of the parent HEK293 cells (Fig. S1). Next, the p53 knock-out HEK293 cells (p53-/-) and wild-type HEK293 cells (WT) were infected with PEDV for different times, and the data showed that the susceptibility of p53 knock-out HEK293 cells to PEDV infection was significantly higher than that of p53 wild-type cells as determined by detection of PEDV-N protein expression (Fig. 2C). This enhanced viral proliferation was also confirmed via assessing the viral 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) (Fig. 2D). These results together show that knockout of p53 increases PEDV infection susceptibility, suggesting that p53 plays an important role against PEDV infection.",

The results showed that Nutlin-3 pretreatment potently inhibited PEDV replication compared with the DMSO treatment. Additionally, 10 \u03bcM Nutlin-3 resulted in more than 60% inhibition of PEDV infection (Fig. 3\nA). Levels of PEDV-N proteins were additionally assessed by Western blot, further confirming the inhibition of PEDV replication by Nutlin-3 (Fig. 3B). Next, the effect of Nutlin-3 on PEDV replication was examined via assessment of the TCID50. This examination confirmed lower viral yields in the Nutlin-3 treated HEK293 cells relative to the control cells (Fig. 3C). Finally, we tested whether overexpression of p53 in HEK293 cells would reduce how readily these cells could be infected by PEDV, transfecting cells with various doses of His-tag p53 and then infecting them with mock or PEDV. The Western blot results demonstrated that PEDV infectivity in p53 overexpressing HEK293 cells was significantly reduced relative to that in parental controls (Fig. 3D). This demonstrated that p53 expression reduces target susceptibility to PEDV infection, suggesting that p53 acts as a major antiviral mediator during PEDV infection.",

However, p53 is also vital for the type I IFN response upon viral infection. To assess whether p53 plays an IFN signaling-dependent role in the control of PEDV infection, we assessed the ability of p53 to induce interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) transcription. The pISRE-Luc vector was used to transfect wild-type and p53 knock-out HEK293 cells with an ISRE-luciferase reporter construct, and cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h, after which luciferase activity was measured. Although PEDV infection significantly activated ISRE in p53 wild-type cells, this activation was substantially reduced in p53 knock-out cells (Fig. 4\nA). Indeed, there was an over 6-fold increase in ISRE transactivation upon PEDV infection in wild-type p53 cells relative to that in p53 knock-out cells. To determine whether ISRE-dependent ISGs were involved in p53 antiviral function, we infected wild-type and p53 knock-out cells with PEDV and assessed ISG expression at the RNA level. The basal transcript levels of RIG-I, IRF-9, ISG56, PKR, MxA, OAS-1 and IFN-\u03b2 were significantly upregulated in p53 wild-type HEK293 cells relative to those in p53 knock-out HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B). We next explored how p53 affects IFN-\u03b2 secretion by infected cells. Supernatants from p53 wild-type cells had greater amounts of IFN-\u03b2 upon PEDV infection relative to those from p53 knock-out cells. This observation confirmed the p53-dependent secretion of IFNs during PEDV infection (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results demonstrate the mechanism by which p53 enhances IFN signaling and secretion of IFN-\u03b2 during PEDV infection.",

Moreover, upon virus infection, the host must have a quick response to the invading virus to avoid infection and prevent viral transmission to nearby cells. By better understanding the host responses important for the control of viruses such as PEDV, it may be possible to better design therapies aimed at PEDV control.

            "text": "Viral infection has the potential to affect myriad signaling pathways, including that of p53, which plays an important role in the antiviral response. A previous report showed that p53 inhibits HIV-1 transcript elongation by disrupting phosphorylation of serine 2 of the pol II CTD, which impairs HIV-1 transcription and replication (Mukerjee et al., 2010). Influenza virus-infected A549 cells trigger the activation of the p53 pathway leading to apoptosis, and blocking p53 increases viral titers (Turpin et al., 2005). Similarly, in this study, we observed that PEDV infection enhanced p53 expression in HEK293 cells at 6\u201324 hpi but not after 48 hpi. This observation suggests that PEDV could antagonize the p53 antiviral response by some unknown mechanism. Some reports indicate that coronavirus papain-like proteinase (PLP) can adversely impact p53 stability via increasing its ubiquitination and consequent export from the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2015). The precise molecular mechanism through which PEDV viral proteins regulate p53 degradation requires further investigation. Taking our findings together, we conclude that p53 was activated early during PEDV infection to promote antiviral functions, but it was degraded at later stages of infection by PEDV to benefit the replication of the virus.",
