In the N. caninum life cycle, dogs and other related canids are the only definitive hosts that shed through their feces the unsporulated oocysts into the environment, beside their role of intermediate host (Dubey and Schares, 2011; King et al., 2010; Gondim et al., 2004; Dubey et al., 2002; Basso et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 1999a; McAllister et al., 1998). Dogs can acquire infection by ingestion of the infected tissues from the intermediate hosts, by vertical transmission or by consumption of the sporulated oocysts from the environment (Gondim et al., 2002; Dijkstra et al., 2001; Schares et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 1999a; Lindsay et al., 1999b; McAllister et al., 1998). Thus, dogs play an important role in the horizontal transmission and maintenance of N. caninum infection in dairy cattle (Dubey and Schares, 2011; King et al., 2010; Gondim et al., 2004; McAllister et al., 1998).",

In cattle and other domesticated bovine species, the transplacental transmission is the most frequent route of infection, being observed in up to 93.7% of cases (Dubey et al., 2007; Schares et al., 1998). In the definitive canid hosts, the horizontal transmission through ingestion of tissues infected with tachyzoites, tissue cysts or food and water contaminated with sporulated oocyst is the predominant infection route (Donahoe et al., 2015; Dubey et al., 2007). The lactogenic transmission of N. caninum has been demonstrated experimentally in newborn calves fed with colostrum infected with tachyzoites, but there is an ongoing debate regarding whether or not this occurs naturally (Davison et al., 2001). It has been shown that dogs fed with milk infected with N. caninum tachyzoites do not shed oocysts (Dijkstra et al., 2001).",

It has also been shown that <5% of cows may have repeated abortions due to neosporosis (Dubey et al., 2007; Pabon et al., 2007). In addition, a cohort study showed that the N. caninum infected dams with abortion history had a 5.6-fold-higher abortion risk than the congenitally infected cows that had not experienced an abortion before (Thurmond and Hietala, 1997). In our study, the proportion of seropositive cows with a history of abortion (28.26%) was significantly higher than the proportion of cows with the same clinical signs but seronegative (2.60%).

A Canadian case-control study suggested that there is a positive association between the occurrence of N. caninum-related abortions in a herd and the annual rate of cattle returning to estrus after pregnancy (Hobson et al., 2005). In addition, a high rate of early pregnancy losses could increase the chance of definitive hosts to have access to the infectious material and thereby it could also increase the rate of oocyst-mediated horizontal transmission. This assumption is supported by the results of four other studies (Waldner, 2005; Mu\u00f1oz-Zanzi et al., 2004; Waldner et al., 2001; Waldner et al., 1998). However, other epidemiological studies showed no indication that N. caninum is able to cause early pregnancy losses (L\u00f3pez-Gatius et al., 2004; L\u00f3pez-Gatius et al., 2005; Romero et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 1999).",

Our findings suggest that neosporosis has a high seroprevalence in Northern Greece with a much greater geographical distribution than previously believed. We also noted a singificantly increased number of insemination needed for conception in N. caninum seropositive dams compared to seronegative dams, as well as a substantial increase in birth interval and abortions in seropositive dams. All these may lead to major financial losses, especially if preventive measures for N. caninum spread are not be applied.",
