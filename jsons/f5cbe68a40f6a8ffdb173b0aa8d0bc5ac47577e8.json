Typically, with single-primer-pair PCR assays, the LOD is 1 TCID 50 /ml or lower, and five of seven viruses demonstrated this on RVA. The overall agreement with firstpass testing (typical clinical laboratory testing) between the two assays was excellent at 90%, and the pattern of discrepant results suggests that it may be much higher (>96%) if the RVA reagents are used on a regular basis. This was best demonstrated by HPIV-3, where the biggest loss of analytical sensitivity was observed. This did not translate into decreased clinical sensitivity after three of the clinical runs were retested. After retesting, the agreement between the two assays went to 100%. The majority of discrepancy between the two assays was in the detection of HPIV-2. Interestingly, the RVA had good agreement in the analytical studies with the Hexaplex and very low LOD. There did appear to be a correlation between low-positive Hexaplex samples (OD ~1.00 or lower) and negative RVA readings (SN < 2.2), but there were too few samples like this and we were unable to do statistical analysis.

The same lots of reagents were used in all runs, and no specific technical error in either the NanoChip 400 instrument or any of the other equipment could be identified.

However, the RVA assay (automated detection) with or without automated extraction demonstrated significant technician time savings, and if the reagents become less expensive, this methodology would have a clear advantage in higher-volume laboratories.

This includes using in-house-developed tests and ASRs. Technological improvements by academia and industry in three major areas are important stepping stones en route to our final goal. These are (i) improved sample preparation methods (e.g., automation of nucleic acid extraction, miniaturization, and use of microfluidics), (ii) improved amplification methods (e.g., multiplex PCR, and microfluidic directed simultaneous multiple single-target amplification with post-PCR pooling of product prior to detection), and (iii) improved detection of amplified targets (e.g., automation of large multiplex detecting and reporting of results). Currently, PCR-based nucleic acid amplification technology is farthest down this road. However, that does not mean that other amplification methods or even proteomic solutions might not be developed in the future. To be most effective in the detection of respiratory viruses, these methods should use a small clinical sample (<500 \u00b5l) and be able to detect many pathogens from that same sample at a concentration of \u22641 TCID 50 / ml, with reporting times in a few hours.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "In this paper, we report the first comparison of two \"in-house\" assays where the major difference was in their PCR product detection strategies (manual versus automated). Our Hexaplex and RVA \"in-house\" assays for seven common community-acquired respiratory viruses represent older and newer steps in improving laboratory diagnosis for mostly hospitalized or severely ill patients with LRI or illness caused by these viruses. The Hexaplex was less expensive for small to medium sample numbers and had slightly better analytical and clinical sensitivity. The RVA assay offered increasing cost savings as the number of clinical samples increased or in situations with limited technician time. This automated detection assay demonstrated a high level of agreement with the Hexaplex. The RVA assay needs to be further optimized and validated in clinical situations and with fresh specimens to better establish its performance characteristics, especially for the detection of HPIV-2. However, in this initial clinical trial, it performed very well. Further improvement in its analytical LOD for HPIV-3 may be clinically useful in samples with low copy numbers, as in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
