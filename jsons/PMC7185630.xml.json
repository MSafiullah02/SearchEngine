            "text": "Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute childhood vasculitis that was first described by Tomasaku Kawasaki in 1967 [1]. KD is characterized by high fever, rashes, cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, oral enanthema, and erythematous induration of the hands and feet. These symptoms resolve spontaneously within 1\u20133 weeks, or soon after early treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin. Inflammation of medium-sized arteries throughout the body, particularly of the coronary arteries, can occur during the acute illness and can result in coronary artery aneurysms in 25\u201330% of untreated patients [2], [3]. KD is the most common acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. Although treatment with IVIG is an effective therapy for KD, not all children respond to it, and its mechanisms of action remain not fully established [4]. Identification of the etiology of KD would greatly enhance efforts to develop a diagnostic test, to improve therapy and to prevent KD. The recent years have witnessed the emergence of interesting findings in both etiopathogenesis and therapy of KD. This review will focus on the immunologic aspects of the KD: aetiopathogenesis and immunomodulatory effects of IVIG.",

They are classified as having incomplete KD, a particularly challenging diagnosis that is more common in infants under 6 months [8], [9]. Serial echocardiography, performed at a center experienced in examining the coronary arteries of children, is needed for patients with acute KD. For children with an uncomplicated course, echocardiography should be repeated at two weeks and six to eight weeks after diagnosis [5].",

Immunoglobulin allotypes represent another system of human genetic markers. They found that in all populations studied, differences were observed between patients with KD and race-matched control subjects. White patients with KD have allotypic markers more closely resembling those of the Japanese population which has a substantially higher incidence of KD [11]. Polymorphisms in several immune genes such as IL-4, chemokine receptor 5, chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 3-like 1 and inositol phosphate kinase C, have been implicated and are compatible with an etiology that is probably infectious [19], [20], [21].",

Therefore, enhanced expression of CD11b induced by circulating inflammatory cytokines is likely to promote adhesion and transendothelial migration of leucocytes in KD [49]. Several clinical studies have reported that activation of PMN may contribute to the severity of KD [50]. In addition, oligoclonal IgA plasma-cell infiltration has also been demonstrated in the arterial wall, the upper respiratory tract and the pancreas of patients with acute KD [51].

High-dose aspirin and IVIG appear to possess an additive anti-inflammatory effect. Practices regarding the duration of high-dose aspirin administration vary across institutions. When high-dose aspirin is discontinued, clinicians begin low-dose aspirin (3\u20135 mg/kg per day, given as a single dose).

The expression of Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIII on monocytes were reduced following IVIG therapy [96], [97]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that IVIG therapy in patients with KD did not increase the expression of the inhibitory Fc receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB in peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages during the acute stage [98].",

Indeed, measurement of the urinary excretion of 8-iso-PG has been shown to reflect enhanced oxidative stress. They have demonstrated that IVIG reduces vascular oxidative stress in patients with KD [99]. The amount of NO produced by neutrophils decreased after IVIG treatment, while there was no significant change in ROS production [48]. This is important because NO has a role in triggering the early endothelial dysfunction in KD [47].",

Further clarification of the mechanisms of action of IVIG in KD should provide insights into the pathogenesis and/or the etiology and help conceiving more targeted therapeutic strategies of this disorder.",
