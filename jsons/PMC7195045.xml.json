(4) It has rather been suggested, that despite increasing ACE2 levels, ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may rather play a protective role. ACE-I by reducing the conversion of ATI to ATII and ARBs, by reducing the binding of ATII to AT1R (and preferably binding AT2R) may tilt the scale suggested by Bombardini et.al. in favour of a protective ACE2-signaling pathway.",

The findings of current trials using ARBs as well as early phase 2B trials using intravenous recombinant human ACE2 may provide further evidence to support the suggestions of Bombardini et.al. (4)",
