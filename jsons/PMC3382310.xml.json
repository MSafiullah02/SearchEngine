In addition, children infected with influenza commonly present with otitis media, nausea, and vomiting and more frequently, complain of rhinorrhea [1, 2]. Historically, the pediatric and elderly populations are considered vulnerable during influenza epidemics [3, \u2013, 5, 6], and although still debated, studies suggest that children have a unique role in the spread of influenza during epidemics [7, \u2013, 9]. Children under 2 years old are more susceptible to secondary complications [10], and infants with severe respiratory tract viral infection are often at greater danger for pulmonary dysfunction, including wheezing, allergy, and asthma later in life [11, \u2013, 13]. In contrast, elderly individuals are at higher risk for developing hemorrhagic bronchitis, pneumonia, and death when infected with influenza [14], and this population generally has a less\u2010robust immune response following influenza immunization.",

Furthermore, individuals with underlying respiratory and cardiac disease or diabetes mellitis, infected with influenza, are often at higher risk for developing hemorrhagic bronchitis or pneumonia and associated comorbidities. In 2008, it was estimated that there were 28,000\u2013111,500 deaths attributable to influenza in children <5 years of age globally, with developing countries carrying the largest burden [17]. In the United States, annual influenza epidemics account for an estimated $10 billion (12% of the total economic burden) in direct medical costs [18] and an estimated $44\u2013$163 million in hospitalization costs for children [19].",

This novel H1N1 virus, hereafter referred to as A(H1N1)pdm09 [20], disproportionately affected children and young adults [21, 22]. Observed mortality increased between four and 10 times in the pediatric population during the initial wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in 2009 compared with previous influenza seasons [23], whereas those individuals born prior to 1950 had pre\u2010existing, cross\u2010reactive antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 [24]. As a result, within the population of those with laboratory\u2010confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09, 2% were older individuals (>60 years), whereas 79% were <30 years old. Risk factors for severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection are similar to those for seasonal influenza but also include obesity. The majority of the severe or fatal cases have accompanying chronic illnesses, such as cardiac disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes [25]. Several studies suggest that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk for complications from infections with A(H1N1)pdm09 [26, \u2013, 28]. Furthermore, severity of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was related to the length of time between symptom onset and the initiation of antiviral treatment with NA inhibitors [29].",

The World Health Organization and CDC recommend that children and adults over the age of 6 months receive an influenza vaccination annually [34]. Currently, there are three licensed seasonal vaccines administered in the United States: 1) a TIV, administered by i.m. injection; 2) a LAIV, delivered intranasally; and 3) an i.d.\u2010administered TIV preparation [35]. Each includes three circulating strains of influenza grown in eggs, reflecting annual surveillance data that predict which strains (A/H1, A/H3, and B) are most likely to be circulating the following season in northern and southern hemispheres. The i.m. TIV is approved for use in children and adults over 6 months of age, whereas the newer i.d. TIV is approved for adults aged 18\u201364 years. LAIV is approved for use in healthy children and adults between 2 and 49 years of age. The current influenza vaccines work to induce memory recall responses, primarily via humoral immune responses against the HA and NA surface glycoproteins, and HA inhibition antibody responses following immunization correlates with protection against infection [36, 37].",

Beginning during the northern hemisphere\u02c8s 2010\u20132011 influenza season, a vaccine containing 60 \u03bcg HA/vaccine strain, as opposed to 15 \u03bcg in other preparations, was approved as an alternative TIV for elderly individuals (over age 65 years) [35]. Following vaccination, ASCs rapidly proliferate upon antigen exposure, and cell numbers peak 1 week postimmunization in healthy adults and children [40, 41]. IgG and IgA ASCs decline to low levels by 4\u20136 weeks postimmunization [42, 43]. This increase in the total numbers of ASCs corresponds to nAb levels postvaccination, peaking at 4 weeks in adults and children [43]. LAIV elicits a strong serum and mucosal influenza\u2010specific antibody response [44], and studies in young children (6\u201359 months of age) showed that those receiving LAIV had significantly reduced incidence of influenza infection [45]. Although limited data exist, influenza\u2010specific ASCs and nAb titers are increased to a greater degree following TIV immunization compared with LAIV vaccination [43, 46, 47], but the role of neutralization of LAIV occurring in antigen\u2010experienced individuals is not well understood.",

Since 2010, universal influenza vaccination is recommended, i.e., for all individuals at least 6 months of age, but traditional efforts remain focused on those individuals at greatest risk of serious disease: young children, elderly, individuals with pulmonary or cardiovascular disorders, and those who are immunocompromised or pregnant [35]. Vaccination programs also elicit indirect benefits, including herd immunity, by which immunized individuals protect those who are immunocompromised or other nonvaccinated individuals [49, 50]. This effect was observed in a retrospective epidemiological study in Japan and the United States examining mortality and influenza vaccination rates between 1949 and 1998 [51]. As children have long been considered to have an important role in the spread of influenza during epidemics [7, \u2013, 9], Japanese officials legislated compulsory vaccination of school\u2010aged children in 1977, and as the policy changed to optional immunization in 1987, it became clear that mortality rates were inversely correlated with overall vaccination coverage. However, recent reviews of vaccine studies in various populations have concluded that overestimation of the benefits of vaccination is common, particularly within the elderly population [52, 53], but studies that take into account selection biases do suggest that vaccination is associated with lower risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza, as well as all\u2010cause mortality [52, 54, 55]. Furthermore, in October 2009, the United States commenced a national influenza H1N1/2009 vaccination campaign, and it is estimated that \u223c41.2% and 43% of the U.S. population received the 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 influenza vaccines, respectively [56]. Following implementation of this campaign, the frequency of positive influenza cultures reported to the CDC declined quickly. Immunization and herd immunity resulting from prior exposure of A(H1N1)pdm09 likely resulted in decreased cases of influenza during the 2010\u20132011 influenza season.",

Continuous epidemiological surveillance of circulating influenza strains is required for keeping pace with antigenic drift and shift (reviewed in ref. [57]). Antigenic drift is an endless battle, whereby viral variants emerge as a result of point mutations within the viral genome, escaping antibody\u2010mediated viral neutralization. Whereas many mutations occur throughout the viral genome, the point mutations within the HA or NA proteins can change antibody\u2010binding domains, such that individuals no longer have adequate, protective B cell memory responses. In contrast, major qualitative changes in antigenicity as a result of antigenic shift occur as a result of genetic reassortment and replacement of one or more influenza gene segments. This, in turn, creates a new influenza virus subtype, to which little or no immunity may exist within the population. Antigenic shift remains a chief concern, in that highly pathogenic influenza viruses could potentially gain efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. As influenza viruses frequently undergo antigenic drift and less frequently, shift, a desirable vaccine candidate would be able to induce highly specific, cross\u2010reactive antibodies and T cell responses.",

Neither of the U.S.\u2010licensed TIVs nor LAIV include adjuvant, but there are several licensed vaccines available outside of the United States that use oil and water emulsions for seasonal influenza as well as for A/H5N1 (reviewed in ref. [58]). For instance, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (Switzerland) manufactures Fluad using MF59 adjuvant, and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Belgium) produces Pandemrix, which includes AS03. Fluad has been used in Europe since 1997 and was recently approved for use in Canada in adults 65 years and older. MF59 and AS03 are both squalene\u2010based with surfactants included to stabilize the emulsions.

The influenza M2 ion channel is expressed at high levels on the surface of influenza\u2010infected cells and has a conserved ectodomain (M2e) that is 24 aa in length [65]. Animal studies have demonstrated improved viral clearance and cross\u2010protection upon lethal challenge in mice following passive M2 mAb transfer or M2\u2010immunized mice (reviewed in ref. [66]). Phase I clinical safety trials evaluating VAX102, manufactured by VaxInnate, have reported increased M2e antibody responses [67]. Creation of a universal influenza vaccine that targets conserved regions of the HA stem region is particularly appealing, and several groups have demonstrated encouraging results using broadly neutralizing mAb to regions of HA that are cross\u2010reactive between Group 1 and Group 2 influenza strains [68, \u2013, 70]. Structural analyses indicate that these antibodies bind to conserved pockets of the A helix of the HA stalk, located below the trimeric head region [71, \u2013, 73]. It is therefore within the realm of possibility to focus immunization strategies to these conserved regions in the HA and M2 proteins to elicit effective antibody, and presumably T cell, responses in the case of emergent influenza viruses. Still, it remains a mystery as to why these conserved epitopes have not generated a high level of cross\u2010protection in populations repeatedly immunized or infected with diverse viral strains.",

Phagocytes function as APCs, engulfing and digesting opsonized pathogens and apoptotic cells. These cells essentially act as scavengers to uptake toxic metabolic byproducts and produce myriad inflammatory mediators, which ideally, result in the killing of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. However, abundant inflammation often has a role in creating immunopathology and can contribute to diverse inflammatory diseases, including asthma [123, \u2013, 125].",

The third monocytic subgroup is characterized by low expression of CD14 and high expression of CD16 (CD14dimCD16+), and at least one study has shown increased numbers in the blood of sepsis patients [148]. CD14dim blood monocytes function as efficient producers of proinflammatory cytokines in response to viruses and nucleic acids [149, 150].

The NS1 protein from influenza B virus inhibits ISGylation, an important host antiviral effector mechanism, by interacting with the N\u2010terminal domain of ISG15 [156].",

In vivo, CCR2\u2010dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes is critical for host defense and contributes to the innate immune response, as well as downstream adaptive responses [157]. During influenza infection, CCR2\u2010deficient mice have reduced monocyte and increased neutrophil recruitment, but, despite higher viral lung titers, in one model of infection these mice were protected from severe pneumonitis [158, 159]. In the lungs, CCR2\u2010mediated recruitment of TNF and iNOS\u2010producing DCs augments influenza\u2010specific T cell responses [160]. At least one murine study suggests that pregnant mice have increased infiltration of neutrophils (CD11bhighLy6GhighMHCII\u2212) and macrophages (CD11bhighLy6G\u2212MHCIIhigh) and elevated, proinflammatory cytokine levels, despite no change in viral titers in the lungs compared with nonpregnant animals [161]. In vitro, influenza infection of murine alveolar epithelial cells resulted in monocyte production of MCP\u20101 (CCL2, the ligand for CCR2) and RANTES, and monocyte migration was dependent on CCR2 expression [162]. Although some murine models suggest that neutrophils may have little role in mediating viral clearance [163], type I interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2)\u2010dependent generation of Ly6Chi monocytes following influenza infection may be necessary to limit excess neutrophil infiltration, preventing tissue damage caused by uncontrolled inflammation [164]. In addition, the newly described innate lymphoid cells have been implicated in having a role in airway integrity following influenza infection [165]. Thus, innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, have at least two roles during influenza infection: to boost the innate immune response by producing proinflammatory cytokines and to enhance influenza\u2010specific T cell responses. However, the lack of clear correspondence between murine and human monocytic subsets has made the application of these data to the human situation difficult and highlights the need for specific studies focused on human innate immune responses.",

The neutrophil chemoattractant IL\u20108, produced by bronchial epithelial cells, is elevated early during experimental human influenza infection [95] and is increased in the serum of A/H5N1\u2010infected individuals [96]. Increased IL\u20108 levels in BALs of humans are associated with the infiltration of neutrophils and may have a role in neutrophil\u2010mediated lung injury and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome [97]. Ex vivo influenza infection of PBMCs has been shown to induce apoptosis in neutrophils [166] and peripheral blood monocytes [167]. Influenza infection of neutrophils resulted in increased hydrogen peroxide production, enhanced surface expression of Fas antigen and FasL, and secretion of FasL into the supernatant [166]. Interestingly, this study showed that influenza infection of neutrophils resulted in increased internalization of Escherichia coli, suggesting a role in controlling bacterial secondary infections in humans. Moreover, standard chemotaxis assays during experimental influenza infection [168, \u2013, 170] or chemokine receptor expression during ex vivo influenza infection [105] demonstrated impaired chemotaxis of monocytes and granulocytes. Still, although all of these studies suggest that neutrophils can be regulated and recruited during human influenza infection, the specific protective and pathological roles that they play in vivo remain unclear.",

Variability between these studies is likely a result of seasonal differences observed year\u2010to\u2010year. Individuals infected with A/H5N1 have high viral loads detected within respiratory secretions and peripheral hypercytokinemia [96, 102]. Severe disease is associated with macrophage infiltration into the lungs, and chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages, such as IFN\u2010inducible protein 10 (IP\u201010), monokine induced by IFN\u2010\u03b3 (MIG), and MCP\u20101, were found to be elevated in the serum of influenza\u2010infected individuals and were highest in those infected with A/H5N1 [96].

These studies (reviewed in ref. [80]) suggested that the presence of serum antibody is associated with protection, as illness is less frequently observed in those people with pre\u2010existing nAb [74]. Subsequent studies showed that protection is also correlated with the development of serum and mucosal anti\u2010NA or anti\u2010HA IgG and IgA [37, 47, 75, \u2013, 77, 78], but this protection can be incomplete, as individuals with detectable nAb can still be infected [79, 174]. Antibodies specific for the NA have been shown to reduce disease severity by restricting virus release from infected cells and enhancing viral clearance (reviewed in ref. [175]). In addition to HA and NA, antibodies are produced to NP, matrix M2 protein, and PB1\u2010F2 [176], although the significance of these responses remains unclear.

Even prior to 2009, it was well\u2010recognized that heterosubtypic immunity has a large role in protection against antigenic variants of influenza [84, 85], and vaccine studies support the idea that cross\u2010protective, adaptive immune responses occur [86]. Likewise, neutralizing polyclonal antibodies cross\u2010reactive against H5 can also be produced in individuals vaccinated against seasonal influenza, as well as those naturally infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 [87, 88]. Compared with seasonal influenza infections prior to 2009, \u223c31% of B cell epitopes are conserved in A(H1N1)pdm09, with 17% of those conserved within the surface viral proteins [177]. The HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 contains sequences homologous with that of A/H1N1 (1918) demonstrated by the A/H1N1 (1918) mAb 2D1, which binds to the Sa antigenic site of the HA [89]. Furthermore, this particular antibody can neutralize HA activity in vitro, and mAb\u2010treated mice show reduced viral titers when challenged with A(H1N1)pdm09 [90]. Most neutralizing antibodies bind to the exposed regions of the HA that surround the receptor\u2010binding site and interfere with attachment to sialic acids on the cell surface. Therefore, generation of cross\u2010protective neutralizing antibodies is elusive, as the external viral proteins are most exposed to immune pressure, but universal immunization against conserved HA stalk and M2e domains is promising [71, \u2013, 73].",

The relevance of these observations remains somewhat controversial in humans. Regardless, as in mice, the human lung contains resident respiratory virus\u2010specific CD8+ memory T cells [182], which can effectively kill virus\u2010infected cells. Human CD8+ T cells recognize antigen in the context of surface HLA molecules and generally recognize a broad range of influenza epitopes, including those from structural and nonstructural influenza proteins [121]. Approximately 41% of CD4+ and 69% of CD8+ T cell epitopes are conserved in A(H1N1)pdm09 from the prior circulating seasonal H1N1 [177]. Furthermore, CD8+ intraepithelial T cells can mount fast and efficient recall responses upon viral infection [183], and immunization studies in humans have shown that T cell responses peak within 1 week after symptom onset [174]. In terms of pandemic viruses, individuals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 were shown to have rapid, virus\u2010specific CD8+ T cell recall responses early during infection, but this CTL response wanes over time [184]. Likewise, vaccinated individuals, who were then naturally infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, had T cell responses increase by twofold early after infection [174]. Memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of healthy individuals are also cross\u2010reactive against proteins of heterologous viruses, including those from A(H1N1)pdm09 and A/H5N1 [91, \u2013, 93, 94], but immunocompromised patients do not have lasting antibody or CD4+/CD8+ memory responses following natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [185]. Furthermore, CTLs, isolated from A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010 or A/H5N1\u2010inexperienced individuals with a memory CD45RAmedCD62 ligandloCCR7\u2212 phenotype, will respond robustly to peptide pools and influenza\u2010infected cells [34, 177, 186, 187], suggesting that T cells may provide some level of protection against conserved epitopes [110]. Although nonconserved regions of the virus may effectively escape recognition by T cells [188], the majority of T cell responses is elicited against conserved, internal viral proteins, generating much interest in vaccine or therapeutic strategies that involve T cell\u2010mediated immunity.",

Despite being such a critical target population, there are relatively few neonatal models of respiratory infections, and for ethical reasons, it is appropriately difficult to acquire data from human neonates. In the case of RSV infection, murine neonate models suggest that the age of primary viral infection can determine the immunopathology of a secondary viral infection [192, \u2013, 194]. During RSV infection, younger murine neonates (\u22647 days) will develop an immune response characterized by increased eosinophil and T cell recruitment to the lungs, enhanced airway hyper\u2010responsiveness, and higher IL\u201013 levels upon reinfection 12 weeks later, whereas older mice (\u22654 weeks) develop an immune response characterized by decreased T cell and eosinophil recruitment to the lungs upon reinfection [192, 193]. Likewise, a neonatal mouse model of influenza A virus showed that early infection was associated with decreased CD8+ T cell recruitment and function and enhanced airway inflammation [195]. These studies highlight an important concept, whereby infection too early results not in protective immunity but immunopathogenesis. Consistent with an age\u2010dependent defect in adaptive immunity, during RSV and influenza infection of infants, few CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or CD56+ NK cells are found in the upper and lower airways [100, 103, 104], in contrast to the observed infiltration of lymphocytes in adult A/H5N1 influenza [106] and SARS CoV infections [196, 197]. Moreover, fatal cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 had increased numbers of CD8+ T cells and granzyme B+ cells in their lungs [33]. This observation may represent a correlation with higher levels of viral antigen or may indicate a pathogenic role of exuberant CD8+ T cell responses. On the other hand, the elderly have been shown to have reduced CTL activity compared with younger individuals, and this can have a negative impact on immunization efficacy [111, \u2013, 113]. However, prevaccination T cell responses do not correlate with postvaccination antibody titers [114], and as the elderly also have decreased antibody responses following vaccination, T cell responses may provide a better correlate of vaccine efficacy in the elderly population [115]. Interestingly, unstimulated memory T cells from older individuals are in a higher state of differentiation than those of younger individuals, and it was shown that fewer senescent, influenza\u2010specific T cells, characterized as killer cell lectin\u2010like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1)hiCD57hi, are associated with a more robust antibody response following TIV delivery [110].",

However, studies suggest that although this CD8+ T cell response to M158\u201366 is conserved in HLA\u2010A*02 individuals, it may not be strictly immunodominant, as greater responses were observed against internal NP and polymerase PB1 subunit proteins in some individuals [122, 200]. In terms of HLA presentation of influenza peptides, the HLA\u2010A*02:01\u2010restricted M158\u201366 peptide\u2010specific CTL response is characterized by expression of V\u03b217 TCR use [201], and in HLA\u2010A*02:01 individuals, V\u03b217+ CTLs were the dominant cells responding to in vitro influenza exposure. In contrast, cord blood from HLA\u2010A*02:01 infants, thus having no prior influenza exposure, was characterized by a M158\u201366\u2010specific CD8+ T cell response that was less dependent on the presence of the CD8+V\u03b217+ T cell population [109]. Therefore, maturation of the CTL response upon subsequent influenza infections is likely related to effective clearance of viral infections and has important implications for therapeutic interventions. Although children beyond infancy who are considered high\u2010risk for influenza infection, i.e., children with underlying diseases, such as asthma, sickle cell disease, and those receiving solid organ transplantation, have significant increases in serum nAb and T cell responses, children with systemic lupus erythematosus are unable to mount significant T cell responses following TIV immunization [108].
