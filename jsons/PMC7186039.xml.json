            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses of birds and mammals including humans. As a representative of the Gamma-coronavirus genus, the avian coronavirus (AvCoV) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) may cause highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens and other galliforme birds [1]. IBV spread fast between individuals may cause a morbidity rate of 100% in bird populations which have not been vaccinated [2]. Chickens infected with IBV exhibit the symptoms of mild respiratory such as coughing, gasping, rales, and nasal discharge, and appearing depressed, or severe kidney and oviduct disease [3], [4], which may result in a decrease in egg production or quality. Development of affordable and highly sensitive detection methods for rapid monitoring and screening of IBV is extremely important, especially in less-developed countries. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test have now been used as gold standard for nucleic acid biomarker diagnostics. However, conventional ELISA can only work on a higher concentration of target molecules hence makes the approach not quite suitable for highly sensitive detection, while PCR usually requires expensive reagents and equipment as well as skilled personnel for the complicated process [5]. All these limitations restrict their applications in on-site detection.",

Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained world-wide attention as a group of 2D layered nanomaterials analogous to graphene owing to their excellent optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, and energy-harvesting properties. TMDs have been widely used in many research including DNA detection, transistors, photodetectors and photovoltaic devices [9], [10]. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an emerging material and one of such TMDs that can be synthesized in large scale and directly dispersed in aqueous solution and no treatment of surfactants or oxidation is required [11], [12]. Moreover, a higher fluorescence-quenching ability than graphene and the hydrophobicity property of surface make MoS2 become promising material in biosensing platforms and finding various applications [13]\u2013[18]. The hydrophobicity of the MoS2 surface is a key enabling feature, because it enables strong affinity of protein-surface adsorption [11]. Kong et al.\n[11] made an aptamer-functionalized MoS2 biosensor by using the high fluorescence-quenching ability between MoS2 and dye-labeled single-stranded DNA probe for prostate specific antigen detection. High sensitivity and high selectivity with a detection limit for the PSA of 0.2 ng/mL were achieved.

We developed a single-step immunosensor on cotton thread based on antibody-functionalized MoS2 for the detection of IBV. The principle is based on a homogeneous FRET immunoassay, the sensing mechanism is shown in Fig. 1. The distinct quenching property of MoS2 on the fluorophore during the antigen-antibody reaction was adopted. The antibody (Ab) probes are modified with fluorescent dye labelling (dyed-IBV-Ab) and MoS2(MoS2-IBV-Ab bioconjugates), respectively. In the presence of IBV, both the dyed-IBV-Ab and the MoS2-IBV-Ab bioconjugates will specifically bind with the target IBV due to the antigen-antibody reaction. After binding, the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab probe is largely quenched owing to the transfer of electrons or energy between the closely connected dye molecules and the MoS2. In the absence of IBV, the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab probe will not change. Therefore, the concentration of the IBV in the chicken blood sample can be quantitatively determined by analysis the fluorescence intensity in an assay.\n",

The transportation of fluidic was investigated firstly by using food color and it was observed that the fluid could reach the test zones within 1 min due to the capillary wicking. In addition, a time duration of 6 min was found to be sufficient for a complete reaction, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The reaction time is slightly shorter that conducted in microplate. This may be attributed to the faster kinetics due to the better mixing effect on the thread. A wide range of IBV standard solution was detected. The IBV standard solution ranging from 0~106 EID50 per mL was analyzed by the presented thread immunosensor to obtain the standard curve and calculate the limit of detection. A linear fit of the obtained relative fluorescence intensity difference with respect to varying concentration of IBV standards is plotted in Fig. 5 (b). The values denote average relative fluorescence intensity difference (n = 3) compared to negative control with standard deviation as error bars. It is shown that a distinct change presents starting from 102 EID50 per mL with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9828.

The different fluorescence responses of the test zones on the cotton thread upon the detection of various concentrations of IBV standard solution are shown in Fig. 5 (c). It is clearly seen that the fluorescence of the dyed-IBV-Ab was significantly quenched for all concentrations of IBV standard solution. With the concentration of IBV increases, the fluorescence is quenched more because more \u201csandwich\u201d complex of dyed-IBV-Ab / IBV / MoS2-IBV-Ab are formed, resulting in largely quenched owing to the transfer of electrons or energy between the closely connected dye molecules and the MoS2.\n",
