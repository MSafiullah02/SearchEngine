            "text": "The coronavirus replicase gene encodes one or two papain-like proteases (termed PL1pro and PL2pro) implicated in the N-terminal processing of the replicase polyprotein and thus contributing to the formation of the viral replicase complex that mediates genome replication. Using consensus fold recognition with the 3D-JURY metapredictor followed by model building and refinement, we developed a structural model for the single PLpro present in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) genome, based on significant structural relationships to the catalytic core domain of HAUSP, a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP). By combining the SCoV PLpro model with comparative sequence analyses we show that all currently known coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group includes all PL2pros and some of the PL1pros, which are characterized by a restricted USP-like binding site. This group is designated the R-group. The remaining PL1pros from some of the coronaviruses form the other group, featuring a more open papain-like binding site, and is referred to as the O-group. This two-group, binding site-based classification is consistent with experimental data accumulated to date for the specificity of PLpro-mediated polyprotein processing and PLpro inhibition. It also provides an independent evaluation of the similarity-based annotation of PLpromediated cleavage sites, as well as a basis for comparison with previous groupings based on phylogenetic analyses.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positivesense RNA viruses. 1 Besides economically important veterinary pathogens, 2 they include human coronaviruses (HCoVs), which are a cause of respiratory tract diseases, including the common cold, and occasional enteric infections. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The identification of a coronavirus as the infectious agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia, has led to a renewed interest in coronaviruses. 9 Despite successful containment of the first SARS epidemic by quarantine measures, human SARS coronavirus (SCoV) infections persist 10 without any specific therapy at hand. 9, 11 Interferon treatment is currently regarded most useful, 11 whereas the broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analog ribavarin and the HIV protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir proved ineffective. 12, 13 Upon cell infection, the viral replicase gene is translated directly from the viral genome. 14 Autocatalytic processing by two proteases, which are part of the replicase polyprotein, releases 14 -16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). 15 These form a membrane-bound RNA replication complex. 14,16 -18 One of the two coronaviral proteases, the 3CLpro, has already generated much interest as a target. 11 It resides in nsp5, and, after autocleavage, releases the downstream replicase subunits. 14 The processing of the amino-proximal nsps is carried out by one or two paralogous protease domains within nsp3, the largest of the nsps. 15,19 -25 They are defined by homology to the papain-like fold 15 and constitute the peptidase family C16. 26 Mutational analyses support the presence of a Cys-His catalytic dyad. 15, 22, 25 Most coronaviruses harbor two such papain-like protease domains, PL1pro and PL2pro, whereas SCoV and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) utilize only one, which is equivalent to PL2pro. 27 PL2pro may cleave down-and upstream of nsp3, 21, 22 but only upstream cleavages were associated with PL1pro. 15, 19, 21, 24 Additional nsp3 domains include the X domain, which is predicted to constitute a RNA processing enzyme, 27 and the hydrophobic Y domain, which likely anchors nsp3 to membranes. 21, 28 The PLpro cleavage products nsp1-3 all colocalize with the replication complex. 14, 16, 17, 28 The synthesis of both negative-and plus-strand virus RNA require ongoing viral protein production, 29 -31 and complete processing of the replicase N-terminal nsps appears to be essential for optimal virus growth. 32 The development of selective PLpro inhibitors 22 may, therefore, provide a new class of antivirals. However, little is known about the molecular basis of PLpro cleavage site sequence recognition, nor the significance for the existence The Supplementary Material referred to in this article can be found online at http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jpages/0887-3585/ suppmat/ *Correspondence to: Traian Sulea or Robert M\u00e9nard, Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada, 6100 Royalmount Avenue, Montreal, Quebec H4P 2R2, Canada.

The authors modeled an additional \u03f350-residue sequence, which connects the amino-and carboxy-terminal subdomains of the putative papain fold, as a Zn-ribbon. Indeed, the recombinant PL1pro domain binds equimolar amounts of zinc, and mutation of the predicted zinc-binding motif abolished catalytic activity. 39 Recently, we have identified a structural relationship 40 between the SCoV PLpro and the catalytic core domain of the papain-like herpesvirusassociated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP), also known as USP7, of the C19 family of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). 26 Instead of a classical Zn-ribbon, as proposed for the PLpros by Herold and coworkers, 39 HAUSP contains a circularly permuted Zn-ribbon-like domain inserted between the two subdomains of the papain fold. 41 We further recognized 40 that the binding site complementarity of HAUSP to the C-terminal ubiquitin sequence LRGG matches the narrow specificity profile (LXGG) of SCoV PLpro. 22, 25, 27 In this study, we survey in detail the substrate interactions predicted in the binding site of SCoV PLpro, particularly in the S 1 and S 2 subsites. The structural framework provided by the modeled SCoV PLpro-binding site is then combined with comparative sequence analyses in order to understand specificity data available for other coronaviral PLpros. Despite what their names seem to imply, PL1pro and PL2pro do not represent distinctive subgroups of the coronaviral papain-like enzymes. Indeed, it has not been possible so far to cluster the PL1pro and PL2pro domains into specific groups based on clear functional comparisons. Our analysis reveals a novel classification of all currently known coronaviral PLpros, which is based on their bindingsite characteristics. This classification is further used for an independent evaluation of the current annotation of coronaviral PLpro cleavage sites from public databases.",

First, the homology modeling program COM-POSER 50 in SYBYL was employed in order to fit various regions of the SCoV PLpro sequence onto the 2.3 \u00c5resolution crystal structure of the core catalytic domain of HAUSP complexed with ubiquitin aldehyde (PDB code 1NBF), 51 and onto the 1.9 \u00c5-resolution crystal structure of FMDV Lpro (1QMY), 52 following the sequence alignment shown in Figure 1 . Based on sequence similarities, deletions and/or insertions, and the disposition of secondary structure elements, the following sequence-to-template assignment was adopted: (a) the SCoV PLpro segments K1632-E1701, F1798 -E1803, and T1814 -P1839 were taken from FMDV Lpro segments E30 -E96, F137-F142, and V150 -D176, respectively, largely covering the N-and C-terminal subdomains; (b) the SCoV PLpro segments L1702-T1797, Y1804 -Y1813, and V1840 -E1847 were Multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral PLpros to a structure-based sequence alignment of HAUSP, papain, and FMDV Lpro. Predicted secondary structure elements for SCoV PLpro are shown in gray, and the actual secondary structure elements for HAUSP and FMDV Lpro (PDB codes given in the parentheses) are shown in black above the alignment. \u2424-strands are represented by arrows, \u2423-helices by cylinders, and coils by lines. Selected secondary structure elements referred to in the text are labeled. Active site catalytic triad residues are shown on red background. Putative Zn-chelating Cys residues in the Zn-ribbon domain are highlighted on yellow background, as are the two reminiscent Zn-chelating residues in HAUSP. Boundaries of the Zn-ribbon domain are indicated by vertical red arrows. The position of the putative oxyanion-stabilizing residue is indicated with a red dot, and those predicted to engage in interactions at substrate positions P 1 -through-P 4 (see Fig. 3 ) are indicated with blue dots, except for P1788 and T1841 of SCoV PLpro, which are indicated with blue circles. Papain insertions in the alignment are shown above its sequence, and those labeled 1 through 4 correspond with those indicated in Figure 2 on the papain structure. Residues identical in half or more of the coronaviral PLpro sequences are in white on dark gray background and those conserved in half or more of the cornaviral PLpro sequences are on light gray background, based on the BOXSHADE program (http://www.ch.embnet.org). The conservation highlighting is carried over to the sequences of HAUSP, FMDV Lpro and papain. HCoV refers to HCoV-229E.",

Figure 2 compares the refined model of SCoV PLpro with the crystal structures of HAUSP, FMDV Lpro and papain. Relative to the SCoV PLpro protease domain (i.e., excluding the Zn-ribbon do-main), the larger protease domain of HAUSP has two additional \u2423-helices in the N-terminal subdomain and three additional \u2424-strands in the C-terminal subdomain, together with longer intervening loops. In fact, the smaller FMDV Lpro is a more suitable template for most of the SCoV PLpro protease domain, because of its similar size and an exact match of secondary structure elements. However, the residues predicted to shape the substratebinding subsites S 1 through S 4 in SCoV PLpro (described in more detail in the following section) clearly resemble the HAUSP-binding site that accommodates the ubiquitin C-terminal sequence LRGG. 51 Among the several sizable differences, which led to the prediction of a less-elaborated structure of SCoV PLpro compared to HAUSP, we noted a shorter loop after the first \u2424-strand of the C-terminal subdomain in the former protease. The corresponding loop in HAUSP (\u24248-\u24249) becomes ordered as a \u2424-hairpin (\u24240-\u24240\u0408) upon ubiquitin binding, presumably, because of its contacts with the ubiquitin residues in the P 4 through P 6 positions. 51 The \u242410-\u242411 hairpin loop of HAUSP, however, which also covers the ubiquitin C-terminal residues, appears conserved in SCoV PLpro, but is three residues shorter in FMDV Lpro (see also Fig. 1 ). Figures 1 and 2 further highlight significant differences between the SCoV PLpro model and papain structure (see Fig. 2 for details).",

In the S 2 subsite, the side chains of residues Y1813 and Y1804 completely occlude the S2 pocket and clearly prevent binding of P 2 side chains larger than Ala. As mentioned earlier, these two Tyr side chains are also involved in the anchoring of the substrate main chain at the P 4 and P 3 positions, respectively. In addition, Y1813 and Y1804 side chains are conformationally restricted, particularly, the more buried Y1813 adjacent to the catalytic H1812 residue. The available space around the P 2 main chain is also reduced by the \u2424-hairpin loop between Y1804 and Y1813. Closure of the loop on the substrate main chain also brings it in contact with the L1702 side chain, effectively creating a narrow tunnel into which the P 1 -P 2 di-glycine can fit snugly [ Fig. 3(c) ]. From a structural viewpoint, the overall importance in determining the strict P 2 specificity appears to be Y1813 \u03fe Y1804 \u03fe Y1804 -Y1813 loop. The model clearly explains the observed S 1 and S 2 specificities of SCoV PLpro for glycine residues. 22, 25 The Arg side chain modeled at the P 3 substrate position is largely solvent-accessible, which is in agreement with the consensus processing site sequence for SCoV PLpro containing a variable P 3 residue. 22, 25 The only specific interaction of the P 3 Arg side chain is a long hydrogen bond (not shown) between its guanidinium group and the substrate-covering loop Y1804 -Y1813 of the enzyme. Leu is conserved at the P 4 position of the three polyproteinprocessing sites by SCoV PLpro. The modeled P 4 Leu side chain binds in a relatively defined pocket of the enzyme, where it contacts the side chains of residues Y1804, as well as P1788 and T1841. Low levels of target-template sequence conservation (see Fig. 1 ) decrease the prediction reliability for the contacts with the latter two side chains. The P 5 Arg side chain was readily modeled in a salt-bridge interaction with the E1707 carboxylate group (not shown). Because of its surface exposure, it is not expected that this electrostatic interaction would play a major role in substrate affinity and specificity. Accordingly, different P 5 residues are found in the putative SCoV PLpro cleavage site sequences.",

This precludes hydrogen-bond formation between papain and the substrate main chain in the P 3 and P 4 positions, as outlined above for SCoV PLpro. Importantly, substitutions of the S 2 -occluding residues Y1804 and Y1813 of SCoV PLpro result in a well-shaped substrate-accessible S 2 pocket in papain, suitable for the accommodation of bulky hydrophobic P 2 side chains, such as Leu or Phe. 57 Instead of SCoV PLpro residues N1649 and L1702, which sterically block its S 1 pocket, glycine residues are found at the corresponding positions in papain (Gly23, Gly65) and related cathepsins, which tolerate a variety of P 1 side chains in the open S 1 subsite. Mutation of any of these two glycine residues in cathepsin B to the corresponding non-glycine residues at these positions in papaya proteinase IV, which only accepts Gly at the substrate P 1 position, has been shown to restrict the P 1 specificity of cathepsin B to glycine. 58 The \u2424-hairpin loop Y1804 -Y1813 of SCoV PLpro is replaced in papain by a long insertion (labeled 3 in Figs. 1 and 2) that folds against the C-terminal subdomain of the protease.

            "text": "One group of coronaviral PLpros is characterized by a HAUSP-like binding site and includes, besides SCoV PLpro, the PL2pros from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, MHV, TGEV, and PEDV and the PL1pros from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL, TGEV, and PEDV. In the S 1 subsite of these enzymes (cf. Fig. 3 ), N1649 is absolutely conserved, and L1702 is a non-Gly residue; in the S 2 subsite, Y1813 is absolutely conserved, and Y1804 is conservatively substituted by Phe in some of the homologs. The occluded S 1 and S 2 subsites of all these enzymes are suitable for recognition of P 1 -P 2 di-glycine and appear to hinder accommodation of P 1 and P 2 side chains larger than Ala. We expect the binding mode of the substrate P 1 -P 4 main chain to these coronoviral PLpros to be also similar, because of conservation of the hydrogenbonding residues G1811, D1704, and Y1813, and conservative substitutions of residues G1703 and Y1804. Owing to the restricted nature of the S 1 and S 2 subsites, we term this group of coronaviral PLpros the R-group. Overall, the binding site signature for the R-group of coronaviral PLpro appears to be remarkably similar to that characteristic for USPs. 59, 60 The coronaviral PL1pros from HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV share a papain-like binding site that is clearly distinct from that predicted for SCoV PLpro and form a second group. One major difference from the R-group of coronaviral PLpros is seen in the putative S 2 subsites of these enzymes. Here, Y1813 and Y1804 are replaced by smaller residues, namely, Ser and Cys, respectively. As in papain and related cathepsins, this opens the S 2 pocket for the recognition of bulkier P 2 side chains (Fig.  5) . Together with the replacement of D1704 by Tyr (another papain-like substitution), this also eliminates three hydrogen bonds to the substrate P 3 -P 4 main chain as modeled for SCoV PLpro. Replacement of G1811 and G1806, which are both conserved in the R-group coronaviral PLpros, with larger residues may affect the conformation and flexibility of the substrate-covering loop (loop Y1804 -Y1813, SCoV PLpro numbering). Interestingly, changes in the size of the S 2 pocket also impact the relative location of other subsites: the S 4 subsite of R-group coronaviral PLpros effectively forms the base of the S 2 subsite in the O-group. For example, residues encompassing positions T1841 and P1788, which putatively contribute to the P 4 recognition in SCoV PLpro, might actually impact P 2 recognition in MHV PL1pro. The extent of the steric hindrance at the S 1 subsite in the SCoV PLpro model yet differs from papain. Although the papain-characteristic Gly replaces the bulkier L1702, a non-Gly residue is still present at the N1649 position, which may nevertheless suffice in blocking accommodation of large P 1 side chains, as shown by mutation of the corresponding Gly27 in cathepsin B. 58 Owing to the open nature primarily at the S 2 subsite but also at the S 1 subsite, we termed the second group of coronaviral PLpros the O-group. The presence of hydrophobic residues at the putative oxyanion hole position is another interesting feature of O-group coronaviral PLpros, contrasting with the hydrogen-bondcapable oxyanion-stabilizing residues found in the Rgroup (Gln, Trp, or Thr), as well as in HAUSP and other USPs, FMDV Lpro, papain, and related cathepsins (Asn or Gln).",

            "text": "After the demonstration that SCoV PLpro cleaves at the nsp2-nsp3 boundary by Thiel and colleagues, 22 Baker and coworkers 25 have recently demonstrated that SCoV PLpro mediates cleavages at all three putative SCoV PLpro processing sites. These occurred most likely at the highly conserved P 4 to P 1 motif LXGG, consistent with earlier predictions. 27 Baker and coworkers have also demonstrated different P 2 specificities for MHV PL1pro and PL2pro using extensive cleavage site-directed mutagenesis of the polyprotein. For MHV PL1pro, these studies revealed a stringent requirement for Gly in P 1 and a preference for Arg at the P 2 position, where several substitutions, including Gly, precluded PL1pro cleavage. 34 -36 In contrast, the presence of Gly at both P 1 and P 2 is critical for recognition and processing of the nsp3-nsp4 cleavage site by MHV PL2pro. 23 Liu and colleagues 20, 38 investigated the specificity of IBV PLpro by site-directed mutagenesis at the p41 and p87 cleavage sites, which are equivalent to the nsp3-nsp4 and nsp2-nsp3 sites, respectively, of the other coronavirus replicase polyproteins. 21 These two highly conserved cleavage sites feature Lys, Ala, and Gly at P 3 , P 2 , and P 1 , respectively. A Gly is also found in P 1 \u0408. Mutational data suggest that the presence of P 1 Gly and P 2 Ala, but not P 1 \u0408 Gly are essential for cleavage. The substrate specificities of HCoV-229E PL1pro and PL2pro were established by determination of the polyprotein processing sites by sequence analysis in the laboratories of Siddell and Ziebuhr. 19, 21 Importantly, both enzymes exhibited overlapping substrate specificities at the nsp2-nsp3 cleavage site, 21 and the two experimentally confirmed PLpro-processing sites of HCoV-229E feature P 1 Gly and P 2 Gly/Ala. 21, 37 In summary, the confirmed sites processed by R-group coronaviral PLpros show a stringent requirement for Gly/Ala in P 1 and P 2 , which agrees with the restricted nature of the S 1 and S 2 subsites predicted for this group. The O-group MHV-PL1pro processes the polyprotein at sites with Gly/Ala at P 1 and Arg/Cys at P 2 , which corresponds to the more open S 2 subsite in this group. Thus, our classification of coronaviral PLpros, which is based on the predicted topology of the nonprimed side of the substrate-binding site, correlates with specificity and activity data available for some of these enzymes (see also Fig. 6 ). It is interesting to note that MHV PL1pro (O-group) and MHV PL2pro (R-group), in addition to their different substrate specificities, also display distinct behaviors toward E-64d, a membrane-permeable derivative of the cysteine protease-specific irreversible epoxysuccinyl inhibitor E-64. In virus-infected cells, E-64d was shown to block the MHV PL1pro-mediated processing of nsp1 and nsp2. 28,31 MHV PL2pro-mediated nsp2-nsp3 cleavage, however, appeared to be E64dinsensitive. 61 The molecular basis for E-64d specificity can be attributed to a Leu residue that normally binds into S 2 subsite of most cellular PLpros. 62, 63 The steric occlusion of the S 2 pocket in MHV PL2pro most likely precludes the accommodation of large P 2 substrate side chains or the bulky Leu side chain of the E-64d inhibitor. In contrast, MHV PL1pro has an open papain-like S 2 pocket, which can accommodate bulky moieties, such as the side chains of Leu (from the E-64d inhibitor), Arg (from the nsp1-nsp2 processing site), or Cys (from the nsp2-nsp3 processing site), but would not establish a productive contact with a small Gly residue (Fig. 5) . 6 .

We recognize a remarkable complementarity between these sites and our binding site-based classifications of coronaviral PLpros. Specifically, the majority of annotated processing sites for Rgroup PLpros feature small residues (Gly, Ala) in P 1 and P 2 , which is in agreement with the restricted nature of the binding sites of the processing PLpros. For PEDV, however, there are different predictions in the SwissProt and GenBank databases for the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage sites. Our classification is consistent with the GenBank annotation. In the case of TGEV, the annotated nsp1-nsp2 and nsp3-nsp4 PLpro-mediated cleavage sites contain larger P 2 residues, i.e., Arg (according to SwissProt) or Thr (according to GenBank) in the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site, and Ser for nsp3-nsp4. Given the restricted S 1 and S 2 binding subsites predicted for both PL1pro and PL2pro of TGEV, we revised the nsp1-nsp2 cleavage site annotation to A111-I112, one residue downstream of the SwissProt annotation, thus placing Ala and Gly in the P 1 and P 2 positions, respectively. The nsp3-nsp4 cleavage site of TGEV may also be subject to revision. Processing may rather occur between S2389 and G2390, which is also one residue downstream to the current annotation. Although this reannotation positions Ser instead of Gly in P 1 , it substitutes Ser for Gly in the more restricted S 2 subsite and displaces Pro from P 4 to P 5 . In our model of SCoV PLpro, D1704, which is fully conserved in the R-group PLpros (Fig. 4) , forms a hydrogen bond to the P 4 mainchain NH group (Fig. 3) . However, this would be incompatible with the presence of a P 4 Pro as predicted by the current database annotation. Another alternative cleavage site, in our opinion less favorable, would be between G2390 and F2391, two residues downstream to the current annotation, which although positions Pro in P 6 and Gly in P 1 , introduces Ser in the more restricted S 2 subsite and places the bulky hydrophobic Phe in P 1 \u0408 (unique among coronaviral PLpro cleavage sites).",

As presented earlier, bulky P 2 residues (Arg, Cys) are predicted to fit into the spacious S 2 pocket of these enzymes (Fig. 5) .

The putative representation of PLpros, whether Ror O-type, in the primordial nsp3, and their evolution in the contemporary lineages of coronaviruses, 64 remains speculative. It cannot be ruled out that the involvement of PLpros in processes other than polyprotein processing has played a part in the diversification of their structural relationships, and influenced the co-evolution of their cleavage sites. Interestingly, the O-type signature along with its corresponding cleavage site sequences appears to be less diverse (Figs. 4 and 6) , maybe owing to a more recent evolutionary origin than for the R-type signature. Our results, however, suggest that a conversion of PLpro specificity in either direction would have been associated with major structural active site rearrangements, requiring considerable evolutionary pressure.",

These enzymes are the PL2pros from HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV (Fig. 6) . In order to comment on the ability of other R-group PLpros to deubiquitinate proteins, further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to elucidate whether those coronaviral PLpros can accommodate in their binding sites a P 4 Leu and a P 3 Arg, the residues found in ubiquitin. Owing to the requirement for a bulky P 2 residue 34 and the predicted spacious S 2 subsite (Fig. 5) , it is unlikely that the O-group PLpros will possess deubiquitinating activity. An interesting observation is that, for those coronaviruses where a P 4 Leu residue is found at the replicase cleavage site by an R-group PLpro, the coronavirus also has an O-group PLpro (i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV). The R-group enzyme performs a single cleavage of the polyprotein at nsp3-nsp4, whereas the O-group enzyme cleaves at nsp1-nsp2 and nsp2-nsp3. The SARS coronavirus is an exception, because it has an R-group PLpro that processes at sites containing Leu in the P 4 position, but it lacks an O-group PLpro. In the coronaviruses where there is no Leu in the P 4 of the processing site, there are two R-group enzymes, or in the case of IBV, only one R-group PLpro.",

One can thus reconsider the current classification of coronaviral PLpros and USPs into families C16 and C19, respectively, in the MEROPS peptidase database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk). 26 Comparative sequence analysis data superimposed onto a binding site structural framework show that coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group, termed R and present in all currently known coronaviruses, is predicted to feature sterically restricted S 1 and S 2 substrate-binding subsites and a P 1 -P 4 -substrate-binding mode characteristic of USPs. The other group, termed O, particularly features an open S 2 subsite and a substrate-binding mode that resembles more papain and related cathepsins. This classification, which differs in part from those extracted from the phylogenetic trees of coronaviral replicases and PLpro domains, is a first step toward the understanding of the molecular basis for the processing specificity and inhibition selectivity data that has become available for several members of the family. For the remaining coronaviral PLpros, the R/O classification can be used to critically evaluate and, in a few instances, to revise the publicly available annotations of polyprotein cleavage sites. The ubiquitous presence of the R-group binding site in all coronaviruses can be advantageously exploited to design PLpro inhibitors with a wide-spectrum efficacy against all coronaviruses. Certainly, experimental structure determinations, at least for one family member, will be valuable for a more reliable identification of those structural details that may be required to overcome the predicted inhibitory cross-reactivity with host enzymes, particularly with the USPs.",

By querying the sequence of SCoV PLpro intermediate domain to fold recognition servers, rubredoxins were top-ranked as structural relatives by consensus scoring, albeit below the significance threshold of the 3D-JURY method. The iron-instead of zinc-binding rubredoxins display the same overall fold topology as circularly permuted Zn-ribbons according to the SCOP database (http://scop.berkeley.edu). 55 As for USPs and naturally or manually circularly permuted Zn-ribbons, the alignment of rubredoxins onto coronaviral PLpros sequences agrees with the assignment of metal-chelating residues and secondary structure conservation (Fig. A1) . Fold recognition, however, failed to signal the genuine circularly permuted Zn-ribbons in the structures of HAUSP and Sir2 homolog, which is not surprising because in these cases the Zn-ribbon domains are part of much larger protein structures. These failures rather reflect an existing shortcoming of present fold recognition methods to correctly detect suitable template domains embedded in large multidomain structures. It does not necessarily imply that these two genuine circularly permuted Znribbons are more distant structural homologs of coronaviral PLpros than rubredoxins. Importantly, classical Znribbons were not detected even though they are represented in the PDB as single-domain structures.",

A classical Zn-ribbon fold has its chain termini forming the outer \u2424-strands of the \u2424-sheet. In contrast, a circularly permuted Zn-ribbon fold has its chain termini forming the inner strands of the \u2424-sheet. In both cases, the inner strands are generally longer than the outer ones. The difference between the two folds is particularly striking at the Nterminus. In the classical Zn-ribbon fold, the N-terminus forms a very short outer \u2424-strand, which is even absent in some of the fold representatives. In the circularly permuted Zn-ribbon fold family, including rubredoxins, on the other hand, the N-terminus forms a long inner \u2424-strand. Our prediction that the Zn-ribbon domain of SCoV PLpro contains long \u2424-strands at the sequence termini is compatible with a circularly permuted fold.",

The latter has two additional structural features outside the \u2424-ribbon: a \u2424-strand and an \u2423-helix in the crossover segment connecting the outer \u2424-strands of the circularly permuted \u2424-ribbon (Fig.  A2 ). Both these structural features are utilized in HAUSP to anchor the Zn-ribbon domain to the protease domain. The isolated \u2424-strand is preserved in the modeled circularly permuted Zn-ribbon of SCoV PLpro. Similar to the HAUSP structure, it establishes a parallel \u2424-strand interaction to the protease domain (Fig. 2) . Contrary to HAUSP, the \u2423-helix insertion is, however, predicted to be absent from the circularly permuted Zn-ribbon of SCoV PLpro, as is its interacting loop from the protease domain. This suggests that the relative orientation of the protease and Zn-ribbon domains in the coronaviral enzyme is less rigid than in HAUSP. This may have implications for ubiquitin binding and enzyme regulation.",

In fact, sequence similarities of the intermediate domain of coronaviral PLpros to some rubredoxins appear to be even stronger than to HAUSP. In this regard, it is also interesting to note that Fig. A2 . Structural comparison between classical C4-type Zn-ribbons, rubredoxins, and circularly permuted Zn-ribbons. The two structures shown in the upper row are representatives of a large family of the classical C4-type Zn-ribbon fold, namely, from the RNA polymerase II subunit 9 (left, PDB code 1QYP: residues 1-57) and from the transcription elongation factor SII (right, 1TFI: 1-50). The two structures shown in the middle row are typical examples of rubredoxins, from Pseudomonas oleovorans (left, 1S24: 1-56), and from Pyrococcus furiosus (right, 1BQ8: 1-54). The structures shown in the bottom row are the currently known members of the circularly permuted C4-type Zn-ribbon fold, from the Sir2 homolog (left, 1ICI: 116 -159) and from HAUSP (middle, 1NBF: 325-399) together with the Zn-ribbon in the modeled structure of SCoV PLpro (right, residues 1720 -1779). Ribbons are colored using a rainbow color ramp starting from blue at the N-terminus and ending in red at the C-terminus of each domain.

A Cd 2\u03e9 ion and a Fe 3\u03e9 ion bound to the exemplified rubredoxins are shown as purple and green spheres, respectively. The metal-chelating cysteine residues are also displayed, except for the circularly permuted Zn-ribbon of HAUSP that lost its Zn 2\u03e9 -binding capability and retains two of the four metal-coordinating residues (Cys and His, also displayed).

The principal difference between the rubredoxin and HAUSP Zn-ribbon structures rests in the crossover segment outside of the \u2424-ribbon (Fig. A2) , which in the HAUSP structure mediates the attachment to the protease domain and participates in direct interactions with Ubal. 51 In rubredoxins on the other hand, the crossover segment is a loop that folds against the \u2424-sheet and does not reach to the opposite edge of the \u2424-sheet. Because several of the conserved residues that stabilize the crossover segment in rubredoxins are different in SCoV PLpro, the crossover loop of coronaviral PLpros may have a decreased propensity to fold against the \u2424-sheet of the Zn-ribbon domain, and may, therefore, become available for direct interaction with the protease domain, as modeled in this study for SCoV PLpro (Fig. 2) . Such a loop conformation would further be expected to affect interdomain flexibility and ligand binding as seen in the HAUSPubiquitin complex. 51 Curiously, many of the HAUSPrelated C19-family USPs such as UBP4, UBP15, and UBC11 from higher eukaryotes, feature an uncharacterized sequence insertion of \u03f3290 residues between the \u2424-strand and the \u2423-helix within the crossover loop of the Zn-ribbon domain, as judged by a sequence family alignment that can be accessed through the MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk).",
