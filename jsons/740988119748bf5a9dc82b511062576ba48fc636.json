We should not rest on the laurels we have won for overcoming the classic infections, but we should, rather, prepare ourselves to confront the microorganisms emerging from the degradation of our ecosystem as well as those bacteria that are becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant.

Antibiotics, however, can cause harm as well as good. Erlich, in 1900 in Germany, introduced the concept of selective toxicity of chemicals, showing that it is possible to use an antibiotic that is toxic to the microorganism but does not harm the host. In 1929, Fleming recorded his observation that agar plates in his laboratory contaminated with Penicillium spp. were free of other bacteria such as staphylococci and went to discover penicillin. In 1935 in Germany, Domagk described sulfonamide, not only winning the Nobel Prize in 1939 but also launching a new era of antimicrobial agents. It was not until 1940, however, when Chain and Florey used penicillin in the treatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, and that was the turning point in the management of infectious diseases.",

Cost is another factor and one that is often overlooked. It is important to be aware of the fact that some antibiotics are expensive. There have been 1. The use of antibiotics for treatment of ocular infections should be initiated whenever a patient has an infection which is microbial in nature and the organism is susceptible to the antibiotic prescribed 2. The patient's history and eye examination should be consistent with the diagnosis of microbial infection 3. Ocular specimens for stain, cultures, or molecular diagnosis (e.g., PCR) should be obtained before the initiation of therapy and sent immediately to the laboratory. The etiologic organism causing the infection should be identifi ed 4. In serious infections, treatment may be started empirically before laboratory results are obtained 5. The selection of the antibiotic should be based on the susceptibility of the organisms, adverse effects, penetration into the affected tissue, and cost 6. Discrepancies between the results of the laboratory sensitivity tests and the patient clinical response should be carefully evaluated 7. Adverse effects from the use of the antibiotic (allergic or toxic) should be taken into account in the selection and administration of antibiotic agents' autotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity. The antibiotic should be discontinued if an allergic or serious adverse reaction occurs after its use 8. Blood level monitoring of systemic antibiotics should be assessed whenever indicated 9. Duration of therapy is dependent on the nature of the infection and site of the infection but should not be less than 1 week 10. The route of antibiotics should be given at a dosage level that will allow penetration of the antibiotic into the desirable infected site within the safe margin and for the shortest period of time to eradicate the offending agent 11. The possibility of a superinfection should always be kept in mind when antibiotics are used for a prolonged period of time 12. The use of antibiotic combinations should be avoided unless the organism has not been cultured and the fi ndings are highly suggestive of infectious etiology 13. Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery should be used very carefully; the antibiotic used should cover both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and be started just before surgery and discontinued immediately following surgery 14. Long-term use of antibiotics should be avoided instances of patients receiving very expensive therapy when in fact the organism responsible for their infection was sensitive to much cheaper antibiotics. The combination of antibiotic agents may be used simultaneously in the following conditions: (a) In a severe devastating vision-threatening ocular infection of unknown etiology and after lab tests have been initiated to determine a specifi c etiologic agent (b) If an infection is caused by more than one organism (c) The emergence of resistant strains of bacteria during the treatment (d) In case of infections caused by organisms that are known to respond better to simultaneous use of more than one antibiotic such as Toxoplasma and Acanthamoeba (e) Organisms not cultured and the clinical fi ndings are highly suggestive of infectious etiology",

Inhibition of protein synthesis is also achieved when tetracyclines and aminoglycosides bind to 30S portion of the bacterial ribosome, while the chloramphenicols, lincomycins, and erythromycin bind to the 50S portion of the bacterial ribosome. The selectivity is partial and these antibiotics may have some toxic effect on human cells. Topical chloramphenicol, is widely used to treat ocular surface infections. There have been several reports of fatal aplastic anemia following topical administration of chloramphenicol. The incidence of idiosyncracy to chloramphenicol is not high; nonetheless, if large numbers of patients are given topical chloramphenicol, cases of fatal aplastic anemia will occur. In other situations, the use of certain antibiotics is neither ideal nor appropriate. Approximately 30 % of staphylococci isolated from ocular infections are resistant to erythromycin. Erythromycin cannot be considered the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Fusidic acid is another antibiotic in this group and is helpful in the treatment of staphylococcal blepharitis [ 29 , 30 ] .",

Unfortunately, resistant strains of staphylococci to fusidic acid started to appear. Currently, close to 52 % of ocular isolates of staphylococci are sensitive to fusidic acid. The topical use of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol is less effective and carries risks of systemic adverse effects. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic which is considered to have a very narrow spectrum, with many organisms resistant to it, and carries the risk of aplastic anemia.

Twenty-three subjects received azithromycin 0.5 % eyedrops, 58 subjects received azithromycin 1.0 % eyedrops, and 38 subjects received azithromycin 1.5 % eyedrops. Tears were collected from each subject at seven time points over a 24-h period using the Schirmer strips that were weighed before and after tear sampling. The tear samples were analyzed for azithromycin by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The peak of azithromycin was noted 10 min after instillation and the mean concentration remained above 7 mg/l for 24 h. A late-onset increase in the tear concentration of azithromycin was noted at 8-12 h and may be explained by the known azithromycin release from the tissues after storage in the cells [ 31 , 35 , 36 ] .",

These drugs have good in vitro actions against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, while action against anaerobic bacteria remains poor. The mechanism of action of the quinolones is through inhibition of DNA gyrase. Lomefl oxacin is effective against most Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Studies on Chlamydia trachomatis show that this organism is moderately susceptible to lomefl oxacin.",

Unionized fl uoroquinolones are considered to be very lipophilic, a factor that is thought to infl uence considerably the mechanism by which these compounds penetrate bacterial cell membranes. Fluoroquinolones are approximately 20-30 % protein bound. This value has been found to be independent of the drug concentration. Following oral administration of lomefl oxacin, 10 % of the drug is protein bound in the serum. Evidence from animal studies suggests that lomefl oxacin is excreted unchanged by the kidney, although small concentrations of 5 metabolites have been described. The most notable drug interaction occurring is the effect of fl uoroquinolones on the clearance of theophylline. Plasma concentrations of theophylline are raised by approximately 19 % during coadministration with perfl oxacin as compared to 111 % for enoxacin and 23 % for ciprofl oxacin. Ofl oxacin and nalidixic acid do not increase the apparent plasma level of theophylline. The interaction is supposed to rise, not through the parent fl uoroquinolone but through their 4-oxo metabolites. This interaction is produced through the effect on hepatic p450-related isoenzymes resulting in reduced capacity of N -demethylation of theophylline. No oxo-metabolite is produced in the metabolic elimination of lomefl oxacin, and the drug is extensively excreted. Theophylline adjustment does not seem to be necessary in patients receiving concomitant lomefl oxacin.",
