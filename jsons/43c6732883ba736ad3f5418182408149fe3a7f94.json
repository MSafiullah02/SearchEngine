Surveillance data were also observed by researchers who performed similar monitoring researches of wild birds and domestic poultry and identified AAvV-6 viruses(Shortridge, Alexander, & Collins, 1980;Sobolev et al., 2016), such as the isolate rate of AAvV-6 in shorebirds was 2.4% in Germany during the year2001 -2002(Hlinak et al., 2006 and in free-living wild ducks was 0.76\u2030 in South Korea during the winter season (November to February) between 2010 and 2014(Choi et al., 2018). However, our current data clearly indicate that AAvV-6 is a lower isolated virus (the isolate rate was 0.1\u2031, 1/9, 872) in wild birds in China from the year 2013-2017 as compared with other AAvVs, such as AAvV-1 and -4Zhang et al., 2015). Meanwhile, no AAvV-6 isolate was obtained from domestic poultry. To our best knowledge, most of reported AAvV-6 viruses were isolated from waterfowl species, such as geese, teal, mallard and so on (Figure 1). Therefore, future AAvV-6 monitoring studies in domestic poultry should include more samples from LBMs as well as their susceptibility to AAvV-6 viruses may differ from that of wild bird species.The complete sequence obtained for the genome of this Hubei isolate consisted of 16,236 nucleotides, which is the same in size as the other reported AAvV-6 strains excepted with two isolates that is AAvV-6/duck/Italy/4524-2/07 and AAvV-6/red-necked_stint/Japan/ 8KS0813/2008 (16,230 nucleotides genome length). As same as other reported AAvV-6 isolates, the genome of this Hubei isolate also encoding seven structural proteins(NP, P, M, F, SH, HN and L)    in the order 3\u2032 leader-N-P-M-F-SH-HN-L -trailer 5\u2032.To further determine the virulence of the AAvV-6/mallard/Hubei/ 2015, the cleavage site in the fusion (F) protein, MDT, ICPI and IVPI were determined. For AAvV-6/mallard/Hubei/2015, deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the F protein, 112 PAPEPR*L 117 , that contains a monobasic aa residue (arginine, R), is identical to most of AAvV-6 strains (", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequence (a) and complete F gene sequences (b) of AAvV-6.

Because the Russian Far East, eastern Mongolia, eastern Siberia, Alaska, Black Sea/Mediterranean and Asian are linked by the migratory routes of the migratory wild bird species investigated here, our conclusion should commonly be applicable to other similar Asian AAvV-6 isolates. Bird shows, import and trade are other potential opportunities that easily allow the introduce of emerging isolates to susceptible populations, unless strict control measures are complied. The AAvV-6 Hubei isolate here is epidemiological connected to AAvV-6 from other geographical areas, such as FarEast, Siberia, Kazakhstan and South Korea, therefore their presence implies the potential risk of AAvV-6 being spread into the region and country, possibly causing to domestic poultry and wild birds infections. It also necessitates the demand for constant epidemiological surveillance for AAvV-6 isolates among domestic poultry and wild birds in China to discover the potential spread of novel variants from other countries and regions.
