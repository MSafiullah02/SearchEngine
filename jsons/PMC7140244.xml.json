The jump of a virus from animals to humans (spillover) is common among coronaviruses. This happened with SARS in 2002\u20132003 and with MERS since 2012.

            "text": "The transmission capacity, which is usually estimated using the so-called basic reproduction number or R0, is a controversial variable of this new disease. An R0 value less than 1 indicates a low extension capacity of an infectious disease, while R0 values greater than 1 indicate the need to use control measures to limit its extension. Reliable estimates place the R0 value of the COVID-19 in 1.4\u20132.5, similar to the R0 of the coronavirus SARS at the beginning of the epidemic (2.2\u20133.7). This value was reduced to an R0 of 0.67\u20131.23 at the end of the epidemic. By contrast, the coronavirus MERS has always remained at lower R0 values (0.29\u20130.80).4 It seems that the COVID-19 could be more easily transmitted than SARS. However, there is a need to exercise caution. The R0 value indicates the transmission potential of an infectious disease. A higher R0 does not mean a more extensive disease. The flu, for example, whose R0 value ranges around 1.3 each year, infects millions of people worldwide. Neither does the R0 indicate the transmission rate either. R0 is also an average value: there are people who, although infected, will not transmit the disease to anyone, while others may transmit it to many more people. These individuals, called \u00absuper-spreaders\u00bb, were protagonists of two extraordinary events during the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Canada) and MERS in Seoul (South Korea) when, from one patient who was a \u00absuper-spreader\u00bb, dozens of patients, visitors and health personnel from two hospitals were infected. Control measures, such as those used in China, can significantly reduce the R0 of a disease. In this initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, its R0 value is being estimated from multiple assumptions and using complex mathematical models. As epidemiologists, some of us approach these mathematical models with circumspect: a popular saying states \u00abAll the models are wrong, but some are useful\u00bb.",

Current statistics, without entering into discussions about the Chinese authorities\u2019 communication policy or transparency, probably reflect a bias towards the most severe cases which are the most likely to have reached out to the health system. Numbers for mild cases and asymptomatic cases are likely to be lower than reality. In recent weeks the detection capacity (RT-PCR test) of infected patients in the epidemic zone has increased, and this fact could partly explain the increase in case numbers, although many patients may still be undiagnosed. This possibility leads to the discussion about the estimation of the fatality rate of this disease, which currently stands at around 2.0%, with more than 40,000 cases and 1000 deaths.5 The mortality rate for SARS was around 10%, so the disease caused by COVID-19 seems, for now, to be less severe.",

China, the world\u2019s second economic power, is a very large country with 1.4 billion inhabitants. China is ranked 153, out of a total of 167 countries, in the Democracy Index.16 The Chinese government will place a large part of its world prestige on the line if it fails to adequately control this epidemic and if it does not openly share current and updated data of the epidemic, its progress, its doubts and its problems with the rest of the world. From a scientific point of view, there has been greater speed and transparency than there was in 2002\u20132003 with SARS, but there are reasonable doubts about some of the information provided and decisions taken initially by the Chinese local health authorities, mostly subject to political power. The city of Wuhan is a great communications hub: more than one million people enter and leave by train every day and its airport supports an annual traffic of more than 27 million people. It is estimated that, due to the Chinese Lunar New Year, more than 300,000 people left Wuhan shortly before the government implemented internal movement restrictions. China is a country much more connected to the world today than it was in 2002, when it hid the outbreak of the SARS epidemic for weeks. The Chinese megaproject called the Belt and Road initiative will connect highways, ports and high-speed trains to almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, including more than 70 countries. The connection of China with several countries in sub-Saharan Africa is especially critical, where the capacity to respond effectively to health threats is low and health systems are very insubstantial. There are more than one million Chinese expatriate citizens working in Africa today. The connecting routes of the Belt and Road Initiative could also be the expansion and extension routes of any epidemic if it is not quickly controlled at source, now and in the future. The economic impact of any epidemic is considerable, but in this case it could reach an unprecedented magnitude. According to some estimates, a fall of 0.5\u20131% of China\u2019s GDP could occur in 2020. Without a doubt, this would be noticed by the whole world.",
