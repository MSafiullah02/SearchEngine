In addition to their energetic and structural roles in living systems, their role when covalently linked to proteins is critically important in a myriad of molecular recognition processes. Viruses frequently use a glycan shield as a tool to evade the immune system, making glycoproteins the focus of intense interest for vaccinology initiatives targeting these viruses (Astronomo and Burton, 2010). Glycoproteins have historically been difficult to study structurally due to difficulties in overexpressing properly glycosylated proteins as well as their innate flexibility. Indeed, carbohydrates are frequently removed for crystallization studies (Derewenda, 2004). Despite these challenges, several thousand glycoprotein crystal structures have been determined. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have allowed structural studies on previously intractable glycoproteins (Walls et al., 2016a, Walls et al., 2016b; Lyumkis et al., 2013). However, the vast majority of glycoprotein structures suffer from the fact that the resolution of the electron density or electron potential maps for the carbohydrate chains is too limited to allow for accurate atomic modeling of individual glycan moieties. As a result, the implementation of prior knowledge is necessary to obtain reliable and stereochemically realistic structural models.",

The potential for widespread erroneous carbohydrate structural analysis is increasing with the rise of cryoEM as a near-atomic-resolution structural technique, as exemplified by the numerous recent structures solved with unrealistic high-energy ring conformations (Agirre et al., 2015a). These observations emphasize the inadequacy and underutilization of available tools and highlight the need for the development of dedicated algorithms for glycoprotein structural refinement. To address this issue, we aimed to create a tool for the automatic detection and refinement of glycan coordinates while resolving incorrect starting glycan conformations.",

Compared with previous glycan refinement methods (Agirre, 2017b, Gristick et al., 2017), our approach (1) uses a physically realistic force field to ensure glycan geometry remains correct even under large conformational changes, and (2) adds the ability to change the anomer of the glycan. These protocols are publicly available with the latest Rosetta release and enable refinement of glycoprotein structures against cryoEM (Wang et al., 2016) and X-ray crystallography data, the latter taking advantage of the combined Phenix-Rosetta reciprocal-space refinement pipeline (Terwilliger et al., 2012).",

We used cryoEM to image this glycoprotein and obtained a resolution at 3.4 \u00c5. In this reconstruction, 93 N-linked glycosylation sites were visible in the map with at least two N-acetylglucosamine moieties present at most of the sites. Modeling of the protein was done using a homology model of the mouse hepatitis virus (Walls et al., 2016a) in combination with Rosetta de novo (Wang et al., 2015), RosettaES (Frenz et al., 2017), Rosetta density-guided iterative refinement (DiMaio et al., 2015), and hand-tracing using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The glycans were initially placed in the map at their approximate positions and the Rosetta glycan refinement protocol was subsequently used to improve the fit to density along with ensuring proper stereochemistry of the sugar rings and of the glycan bond lengths and angles. The efficiency of the protocol is illustrated by its ability to correct for inaccuracies typically observed in hand-traced models, such as the incorrect geometry of the glycosidic bond between Asn 291 and N-acetyl glucosamine 1,404 (Figure 2\nA), the unrealistic length of the glycosidic bond connecting residue Asn 1,174 and the N-linked glycan chain that did not optimally fit the density (Figure 2B), and high-energy sugar conformations (Figure 2C).",

            "text": "Here we describe a method for refining glycan atomic coordinates against cryoEM and X-ray crystallography data using Rosetta. Since Rosetta uses a physically realistic all-atom force field, it is well suited for modeling into near-atomic resolution density maps, which is the resolution regime achieved for most cryoEM structures. This Rosetta glycan refinement protocol expands upon previous iterations (Labonte et al., 2017) by avoiding fitting stereochemically unfavorable glycan structures into sparse experimental data and instead yielding physically realistic geometries based on prior knowledge of saccharide chemical properties. Using a benchmark set of 12 deposited crystal structures, we demonstrated our algorithm is capable of correcting models containing significant errors in glycan geometry (Table 1) above and beyond previous methods (Agirre, 2017b, Gristick et al., 2017). This is likely due to the increased radius of convergence of our refinement, as well as the ability to flip anomeric state. This functionality should prove beneficial for large-scale model validation efforts such as \u201cPDB redo\u201d (Joosten et al., 2011, Terwilliger et al., 2012). We further demonstrated the strength and versatility of this algorithm for improvement of glycan stereochemistry in cryoEM models determined at near-atomic resolution with two examples of glycoprotein structures recently obtained and refined using Rosetta.",

First, previous work (DiMaio et al., 2013, Conway et al., 2014) demonstrated that Cartesian-space refinement allowing for deviations in bond angle and geometry is important in both structure refinement and native structure discrimination tasks.

Next, each glycan was manually docked into the experimental density near the amino acid to which they are covalently bound. This glycosylated structure was subsequently minimized in cartesian space using a reduced weight on the repulsive score term, fa_rep = 0.05. This was followed by idealizing the anomeric hydrogen, in order to resolve any incorrect anomers, and then relaxing the system using the Rosetta \u201cfastrelax\u201d protocol (Tyka et al., 2011).

Glycan sugar conformations should always be modeled as chairs unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. (B) Two anomeric forms are shown, alpha with the glycosidic oxygen and the C5 carbon in trans, and beta in cis. The anomeric carbon is circled in red. (C) Fucose 507 of PDB: 5NSC has an incorrect anomeric connection in the input (magenta), and this is resolved in the refined model (blue). (D) Fucose 507 of PDB: 5K65 is in a high-energy ring conformation, and this is resolved in the refined model. (E) Asp 297 of chain B in PDB: 5K65 fails to form a glycosidic bond to the N-acetyl glucosamine. This is resolved in the output model, and the connection can be seen in the density after rephasing. All density maps are shown at a threshold of 1.",

(E) NAG 1,386 of HIV has an unfavorable glycosidic bond angle (magenta), which is resolved in the refined model (blue).
