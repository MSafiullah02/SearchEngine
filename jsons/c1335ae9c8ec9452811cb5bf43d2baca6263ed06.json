The findings greatly promoted our understanding of the infectious mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells. Paralleling this, ACE2 was also expressed in the kidney and myocardial tissues of cats and dogs [5] . Sequencing of domestic cat lung tissues further revealed 85% similarity in the amino acid between cat and ACE2. More importantly, three ACE2 domains associated with SARS-CoV in the cat have the highest homology with human ACE2, suggesting that cats may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 interspecies infection [6] .",

Second, for diagnosed COVID-19 patients, their pets need a surveillance and isolation to rule out the possibility of infection. Finally, for the recovered owners, their pets should be also tested and kept in quarantine. These recovered patients might be re-infected when they lived with the SARS-CoV-2carrying pets again after discharge. Recently, some previously recovered COVID-19 patients had a positive virus detection. It was not clear whether it derived from the residual viruses in the body or the viruses in the environment from infected pets.",
