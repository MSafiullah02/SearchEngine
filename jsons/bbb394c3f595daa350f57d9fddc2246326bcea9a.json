Results Of 35 infants, 50% developed eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 15% progressed to ESRD. Nadir creatinine, need for invasive ventilation in the newborn period, and need for surgical diversion after catheter diversion were associated with worse outcomes. 50% of infants requiring invasive ventilation as neonates developed eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in childhood.",

Reported outcomes combine patients with perinatal and childhood diagnoses, varying severity of obstruction, and both fetal and postnatal interventions. In addition, patients with poor outcomes, such as early death or need for subsequent interventions, are often excluded from data analysis. Such heterogeneity likely also contributes to difficulties in identifying factors predictive of renal outcomes. Small studies have inconsistently shown association of antenatal diagnosis, prematurity, oligohydramnios, renal parenchymal changes, nadir creatinine, vesicoureteral reflux, bladder dysfunction, and younger age at diagnosis with worse renal outcomes; however in multivariate analyses only nadir creatinine has been predictive [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

Eligible subjects for this study were male infants born during a retrospective 10-year study period from January 1, 2005 to December 31,2014 who received treatment at a single tertiary children's hospital for severe LUTO from PUV in the first week of life. Patients treated at the institution for PUV were identified through a data warehouse query using ICD-10 code Q64.2 (Congenital PUV) or CPT procedure code 52400 (Cystourethroscopy with incision, fulguration, or resection of congenital PUV, or congenital obstructive hypertrophic mucosal folds). Patients identified using this query were then reviewed for study inclusion by review of electronic medical records. Patients were included in data collection and analysis if they were: (1) confirmed to have PUV in medical records and (2) had catheter or surgical intervention for urinary tract decompression during the first week of life (n = 35). The aim was to isolate a homogeneous population of infants with severe LUTO, therefore presentation by 7 days of life was selected as it is likely that infants with severe LUTO would develop clinical signs within this time period, and infants with less severe LUTO would likely remain undetected. Patients that were excluded included those who presented after the first week of life or who underwent antenatal urinary tract intervention. Although some excluded patients presented during infancy, many presented during childhood. Children who transferred care after infancy or came to the study institution for second opinion were also excluded.",

We found that elevated nadir creatinine, invasive mechanical ventilation, and requirement for surgical urinary diversion other than routine ablation of valves were predictive factors of eGFR < 60 and ESRD. Given the progressive nature of renal disease associated with PUV, we would anticipate that eGFR would continue to decline over time in this cohort of patients, and further study to trend renal function through childhood and into adulthood is needed, including comparison with children who present at Fig. 1 Overall renal survival defined as last eGFR of 60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 or greater without a renal transplant a later age. Children who present at a later age may be at a lower risk for CKD and ESRD, as their pathology is likely associated with only partial obstruction, and may progress at a different rate.

Furthermore, the ability to antenatally recognize and prognosticate the LUTO patients who are at the greatest risk for CKD and ESRD is limited.

Our cohort contained a significant number of premature infants and infants who required mechanical ventilation in the neonatal period. The need for invasive ventilation was associated with lower eGFR. This observation is similar to prior studies that also suggest that need for respiratory support may portend worse renal outcomes. Prior studies of patients with PUV have found an association of oligohydramnios with need for respiratory support after birth [26] and an association of early ventilator support with the development of CKD [11] . Although pulmonary hypoplasia of varying severity is associated with other congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, this has not been typical of PUV. In fact, no children in this cohort had signs of respiratory insufficiency during the follow-up period. These findings suggest that while respiratory failure in the neonatal period may be associated with the development of significant CKD in childhood, it does not appear to lead to long-term pulmonary morbidity in children with PUV. As in other studies, we hypothesize that the need for pulmonary support in the neonatal period is likely related to a combination of factors including oligohydramnios and prematurity. Although there was no association of oligohydramnios with eGFR in our cohort, oligohydramnios was significantly associated with need for invasive ventilation (data not shown). There is also existing literature suggesting an association of prematurity with CKD [27] . Further studies are needed to clarify the causes of neonatal respiratory compromise in children with PUV.",
