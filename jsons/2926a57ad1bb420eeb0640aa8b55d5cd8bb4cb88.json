This means that time (and space) has really existed independently. The focus of the scientific approach has been based on the use of neo classical economics to build models to help explain the physical structure and functioning of cities. This logic has led to the unavoidable need for travel and transport, and the analysis of both the amount of travel and the evolution of cities have been shaped by distance, time and the Euclidean landscape (Graham and Marvin 1996) . The question raised in this chapter is whether these physical constructs are still valid as the temporal (and spatial) boundaries have collapsed with the use of near instantaneous telecommunications and fast transport, as the world moves towards an \"integrated global cultural system\" (Harvey 1989) .",

These are sometimes also called instantaneous and glacial time (Macnagthen and Urry 1998). Here it is argued that traditional constraints of time have been relaxed, as more activities are no longer \"time bounded\". This new flexibility includes social actions, such as work shift patterns, leisure opportunities, and career changes. It also includes valued time in between activities and time alone, or time spent waiting and listening (to music). At the macro level it relates to the globalisation of markets and the importance of time for production and distribution processes, and the expected lifespan in terms of product disposability. All these factors have in large part resulted from improvements in transport and communications technologies (Viger 2002) .",

But importantly, the question raised by the sociologists is whether this is occurring through choice or whether this has been imposed as a result of necessary lifestyle changes. The simple trade-off, between job and home location as moderated by distance, has been replaced by a more complex equation involving housing affordability, location of schools and services, multiple workers, and flexible employment patterns (by time and location). Shortterm constraints result in demand patterns that can accommodate all these requirements. Macnagthen and Urry conclude that \"feelings of powerlessness appear to be compounded by the apparent mismatch between competing temporalities, with peoples' longer-term desires and aspirations developing in opposition to the \"short-termism\" and instantaneous time imperatives largely brought about by living in a globalised society\" (1998, p. 232) .",

There followed a series of large-scale land use transportation studies using this basic relationship (including the classic Chicago and Detroit studies), with changes in land use being taken as the principal exogenous variable.

Much of the modelling and evaluation work concentrated on testing options that reduced travel time. The theoretical justification was that travel was a derived demand and that the value of the activity at the destination outweighed the costs of getting there. This meant that journey lengths should be as short as possible (in the sense of their generalised costs), but the recent empirical evidence seems to contradict the theory. As a result of investment in the transport infrastructure, congestion would be reduced and travel times would improve, but by making transport cheaper (faster) longer journeys would also be encouraged and new trips would take place. The question that this raises is whether there is any individual or societal benefit from this new situation.",

At the aggregate level, an investment could encourage greater agglomeration, then the net effect might be positive, but conversely if it encouraged greater sprawl there may could increase social and environmental costs. This in turn relates back to the land use and transport relationships established in the 1950s. More recently, there has been the equally difficult challenge of linking transport investment to economic development, and bringing additional non-transport benefits to the local economy. If such a relationship can be established there is a double dividend from the transport investment, but if the net effect is merely a transfer of economic activity from one location to another, then there may only be transport benefits (Banister and Berechman 2000) .",

The notion that all travel is a derived demand is becoming weaker, as incomes rise and as leisure time becomes more valuable (Mokhtarian and Salomon 2001). Escape theory (Heinze 2000) hypothesises that leisure mobility is an attempt to compensate for a declining quality of life and travel opportunities are sought to get away from ones everyday environment to do something completely different. Such a line of argument leads to a fundamental dilemma about whether all travel is a derived demand. The traditional view that travel is only undertaken because of the benefits derived at the destination is no longer generally applicable. Substantial amounts of leisure travel are undertaken for its own sake and the activity of travelling is valued.",

A corollary concerns the impact of the new technology on travel flexibility. The new technology provides tremendous opportunity and choice in leisure activities, whether this means time spent in the home at the terminal, or taking the opportunity to book a last minute holiday overseas, or adapting existing activities (such as shopping). In each case there seems to be a strong complementarity between the old (transport) and the new (ICT) technologies. Travel can be replaced by more \"at home\" activities, whilst in other cases more spontaneous travel is generated, and in a third group there is a modification of existing activities, as shopping for example becomes a multitasking activity through a combination of the Internet (e.g. viewing, deciding and buying) and travel (e.g. collection or delivery).",

For evaluation purposes, much of the user benefit (often over 80 per cent of total benefits) is derived from the savings in travel time, which in turn is based on the desire to travel as fast as possible between two places. Several conclusions can be drawn from the empirical literature on the subject. First, having higher flexibility, relative to the various time constraints, tends to increase the value of time. For example, the study by MVA (1987) has shown that people with variable work hours have values of time, which are 15-20 percent higher than that of other workers. Similarly, the ability to schedule activities tends to increase estimated values of time (Small 1982) . Higher tax rates have an opposite effect (Forsyth 1980) .",

This practice has been challenged on the grounds that small time blocks saved (e.g., 5-10 minutes) are valued less by trip makers than larger ones (e.g., 20-25 minutes). Following this rationale it might be argued that the total value of time saved for a large group of people where each saves only 3-5 minutes is negligible. Obviously, it is possible to introduce counter arguments, for example, that for some activities small time savings are a sufficient prerequisite for undertaking them. In general, the use of average value of time across people probably accounts for this problem, mainly because a small but a significant number of people place a very high value even on small time blocks. This is not the place to enter the debate on how these values are time-saving are derived, or how they are used by the beneficiaries or in the analysis. But there does seem to be an inconsistency in the travel time savings argument within cities, where much effort is now going into slowing traffic down for environmental and safety reasons. Although it is not explicitly stated, a certain level of congestion on roads is now seen as \"desirable\" and in many locations (e.g. residential streets and around schools), new low speed limits have been introduced, together with appropriate enforcement measures (e.g. speed cameras).",

The key policy objectives now becomes that of reasonable travel time, rather travel time minimisation.

A further 52 per cent of haulers recorded a 10-25 per cent range of journey time unreliability, and these operated in general haulage and distribution. The next 22 per cent reported journey time unreliability of between 25 and 50 per cent, and the operators here were mainly in food and retail distribution and construction supplies. The final 4 per cent recorded journey time unreliability of over 50 per cent of scheduled times. Overall, the additional costs to industry averaged 5 per cent, but this ranged between 1-2 per cent in 24 per cent of cases to over 10 per cent in 13 per cent of cases. The main compensating reactions of operators have been to time shift with an earlier departure time (79 per cent), or to deliver out of peak hours (65 per cent), or to plan for additional journey times (75 per cent), or to have some rerouting to less congested roads (57 per cent).",

The argument that local destinations are being replaced by more remote destinations as travel speeds increase within a fixed 70 minute time constraint may only tell part of the story. As leisure time and incomes increase, the time available for travel also increases so that there is no budgetary constraint. This may already be happening if international travel is included in the national statistics for travel time. For example, in the UK travel time per person per year has been increasing only slowly over the last 18 years (Table 17 .1 -total increase about 12 per cent), but this only covers national travel, not overseas travel, where most increase in distance and time has been taking place. Air travel by UK residents in the EU accounts for a further 45 billion passenger kilometres (+6 per cent). In their comparative review of travel time budgets, Mokhtarian and Chen (2002) came to two clear conclusions, namely that at the aggregate level there does seem to be some stability in travel time, but at the disaggregate level, there is considerable variability. This variability can be seen as a function of social characteristics, location and the characteristics of the destination. Table 17 .2 gives some comparable data for the UK on the variability in travel times by age, gender and trip purpose. To this list, we would add the problem of measurement, as in the UK time use studies have concluded that published National Travel Survey data un-derestimates travel time by 24 per cent (Noble et al. 2000) . The reason for this is the recording of time in 15 minute time periods that do not have sufficient detail to allow for short (walk) trips. This means that for 2001, the average time spent travelling each day in the UK is 80.1 minutes, as compared with 64.5 minutes recorded in the National Travel Survey, and that the average trip time is about 30 minutes per trip rather than 22 minutes (Table 17 .1).",

All these external costs are difficult to measure, but with respect to congestion and travel time variability, the normal expectation is the difference between actual travel time and free flow travel time, together with estimates of the standard deviation around that value (Oscar Faber 2002) . Under uncongested conditions, the expectation is that the variability in travel time is about 5 per cent of the average journey time, but as the road becomes more congested, this variability increases to between 15 and 45 per cent of the average journey time 1 . More generally, it seems that on UK motorways (1998/99), about 66 per cent of delays are due to congestion, 10 per cent to roadworks, and 24 per cent to other traffic incidents (accidents and adverse weather) (Frith 1999) .",

            "text": "This discussion again brings us back to the notion of time, but in a composite form that allows an activity to be carried out efficiently and reliably within a reasonable time. Time is also not being used in a \"single\" physical sense but increasingly in a \"multi\" physical and social sense. As more time is being devoted to travel activities and more time is wasted in congestion and delay, manufacturers and individuals have become more creative in providing the means to use travel time to communicate, to work, to play games and to organise one's life. The notion that travel time is wasted time needs to be reconsidered, and this is one area where ICT has been instrumental in allowing multitasking. This is where ICT has complementarity with transport in its ability to substitute for travel under certain conditions and also to provide a service for transport (for example through integrated ticketing and journey planning). Increasingly it seems that the weakest link in any travel activity is at the interchange points, as this is where uncertainty arises. As noted earlier, the higher values of time assigned to wait time and interchange time are well researched. But with increasing delays in the system, these interchange links become more important. Apart from the dilemmas it poses for individual travellers or shippers, it raises questions on the amount of redundancy there should be in the system. It also helps explain the rationale behind taking a mode of transport that minimises the number of changes, even though it may not provide the \"best\" alternative. The use of the car rather than rail or taking a direct flight rather than hubbing are two examples of this phenomenon. The goal of a \"seamless\" transport system is dependent on the quality of the services provided, the information about the systems including the ease of using it, and the expectation that you will arrive safely and on time.",

            "text": "Two main conclusions can be drawn from this chapter as it relates to the broader theme of the book, namely methods and models. The first is that the growing integration of transport and telecommunications modelling means that there is a convergence of approaches, so that a new generation of methods are needed that combine elements of each. Some of the chapters demonstrate such an approach, but there are problems with data and more importantly the key variables to be included in such an analysis. The concept of time and its use seems to be central to both transport and telecommunications, and it can perhaps be used as the driving force (or key variable) in explaining patterns of travel and the use of telecommunications.",

            "text": "But there is also a necessity to move beyond current thinking about time as a constraint, to exploring its role as providing new opportunities for travel and activity participation. New concepts of time are required that combine the traditional physical measures with approaches that embrace notions of choice in time use, control over time, multitasking in time, time immediacy, and time dependence. Most of these concepts relate to instantaneous use of time, and more attention also needs to be given to longer term (glacial) time, and the changing patterns of time use over time. The social constructs of time seem to be equally important as the physical constructs of time. This is the second issue.",

            "text": "This concluding chapter has tried to extract some common themes from the other preceding chapters and place them within a wider framework. This has been done for two main reasons. One is to suggest that there are common strands that can be drawn between the often disparate transport analysis that is being carried out on both sides of the Atlantic. The other is to put the case that researchers must place more emphasis on the communication and dissemination of results of their work. They must move on from too much of an isolationist view of research towards engagement with policy makers and other key actors to explain and convince them of the need to take action. Delay and inaction are sometimes appropri-ate, but in the transport sector it seems to be the norm even where there are very clear and consistent messages arising from the research. In the past, too much emphasis has been placed on research output and publication, almost for its own sake. That must change. The new challenge for researchers in North America and Europe must be to make their knowledge and understanding of transport more relevant and accessible to decision makers, and for it to be presented in such a way that they cannot afford not to act on it.",
