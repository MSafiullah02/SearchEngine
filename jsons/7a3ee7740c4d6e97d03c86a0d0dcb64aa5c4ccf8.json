During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient be ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of infection. According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections / aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination. For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections / aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa. ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections / aerosolizations require the so-called \"airborne\", \"contact\", and \"droplets\" additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.",
