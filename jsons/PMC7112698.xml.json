However, the burden of respiratory virus-associated severe illness among young children in India is unknown. In addition, the few studies that evaluated respiratory viral etiologies of severe illness among children in India were conducted before the advent of newer and more sensitive diagnostic tests, including tests to detect more recently discovered viruses.17, 18, 19, 20 Using data from population-based surveillance of approximately 9500 children for hospitalizations for acute medical illness in rural northern India and concomitant testing for respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), we estimate the incidence of respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations among children aged <5 years. We also describe the timing of virus circulation and clinical presentation of children hospitalized with predominant viruses.",

Many studies have reported RSV as the most common respiratory virus resulting in hospitalization in young children, but relatively few have estimated the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations. RSV-associated hospitalization rates per 10,000 children ranged from 109 to 274 among children aged <1 year in studies from rural Thailand, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; 25\u201330 among children aged <5 years in Hong Kong and the United States; and 194 and 450 among children aged <5 years without and with HIV infection in South Africa. Our estimates are similar to those of prior studies from the United States, Europe and Asia. Given the high incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in our study, availability of an effective and accessible RSV vaccine for young children in India would profoundly impact hospitalization rates in this age group. Because the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization is highest in infants aged <6 months in whom maternal antibody interference with immune responses may make vaccination challenging, RSV vaccination of pregnant women has been suggested as another potential vaccination strategy.27, 28, 29 Though licensed RSV vaccines are not currently available, candidate vaccines are under development15, 16 and data on RSV disease burden will be important for policy decisions about RSV vaccine introduction if a licensed vaccine becomes available.",

Though adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza viruses have all been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of severe illness, our hospitalization incidence estimates for these viruses should be interpreted with more caution as detection of these viruses has varied among control groups in other studies.9, 10, 30\n",

            "text": "Several points should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, our study was conducted at primary and secondary level health facilities without capacity to provide mechanical ventilation and intensive care for critically ill children. Thus, we may have missed hospitalizations of children with more severe illness who were directly admitted to tertiary care hospitals outside the study area. Our study community may also have been too small to evaluate the frequency of rare but severe outcomes such as death. Second, although we attempted to collect the discharge diagnosis of all enrolled children, these data were largely absent from the medical record and therefore could not be used to aid interpretation of respiratory virus testing results. Third, we included testing results for only a select group of respiratory viruses previously identified as being associated with a large proportion of respiratory illnesses in children. Therefore, our results reflect the burden of respiratory virus-associated hospitalizations caused by this select group of viruses. We did not include test results for rhinoviruses because interpretation of rhinovirus detection in the absence of a control group is difficult, although rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus in children with respiratory illness in some prior studies. Additionally, we did not conduct testing for coronaviruses other than coronavirus 229E, and may have underestimated the incidence of coronavirus-associated hospitalization in the study community. Lastly, respiratory virus circulation and incidence is known to vary by year. Our study was conducted over a two year period and we present average annual cumulative incidences of virus-associated hospitalization. Additional studies of respiratory virus-associated disease burden during additional years will be useful for comparison with our findings.",
