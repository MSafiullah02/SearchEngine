            "text": "ISG15 is a 17 kDa ubiquitin-like modifier that is rapidly induced by type 1 interferon signaling. It was one of the first interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products identified (1) and the first ubiquitin-like modifier, after ubiquitin, to be discovered (2, 3). As an interferon-induced protein, ISG15 was long presumed to function in the innate immune response to infectious agents, but it is only in recent years that it has been shown to have antiviral activity against a broad range of virus types, including Influenza, Ebola, Sindbis, Herpes, and HIV (4\u20137). Several virus types also appear to have evolved mechanisms for blocking the antiviral effects of ISG15. The Influenza NS1B protein and the Vaccinia E3 protein bind noncovalently to ISG15 and block conjugation (8, 9), and the SARS and Crimean Congo Hemmorhagic Fever virus encodes a protease that functions as a deconjugating enzyme for ISG15 (10, 11).",

The X-ray crystal structure of free ISG15 has been solved, and there appears to be little or no stable interactions between the two domains (12). ISG15 is the only Ubl where the last six residues of the processed form of ISG15 are identical to those of ubiquitin (LRLRGG). While there may be no further significance to this C-terminal identity, this may be the basis of confusion over the identity of specific deconjugating enzymes for ISG15 (13\u201315). Interestingly, ISG15 was also reported to be a secreted protein with cytokine activities (16, 17); however, the relationship between this function and its intracellular function as a protein modifier is unknown.",

            "text": "There is a single major E1, E2, and E3 enzyme for ISG15 in human cells, and all of these are induced at the transcriptional level by type 1 interferons. Ube1L is the E1 enzyme (8), and the E2 enzyme is UbcH8/Ube2L6 (18\u201320). UbcH8 has been widely reported to function with ubiquitin (21\u201327), but determination of kinetic constants of Ube1L and Ube1 for UbcH8 and UbcH7 suggested that UbcH8 is unlikely to function as a ubiquitin E2 in vivo (18). The major E3 for ISG15 is human Herc5, a HECT domain ligase with N-terminal RCC1 repeats (28, 29). Herc5 siRNA knockdown leads to a dramatic decrease in overall ISG15 conjugation activity, affecting conjugation to all apparent cellular target proteins (29). Herc5 is the only human HECT E3 known to be a ligase for anything other than ubiquitin. Co-expression of ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 in non-interferon stimulated cells reconstitutes robust ISG15 conjugation to the broad spectrum of target proteins (Fig. 1), consistent with the notion that these enzymes represent the core interferon-induced components of the ISGylation system (28\u201330). Plasmids expressing mutant forms of each of these components can be used as negative controls when examining ISGylation (Fig. 1). The C-terminal ubiquitin fold domain (UFD) of Ube1L is required for interaction with UbcH8 and deletion of this domain (Ube1L\u0394UFD) results in the inability of Ube1L to transfer ISG15 to UbcH8. F62 of UbcH8 is a conserved residue among E2 proteins that has been shown to be critical for the E2/E3 interaction, and mutation of this residue (UbcH8 F62A) prevents transfer of ISG15 from UbcH8 to Herc5. Mutation of the active site cysteine of Herc5 (Herc5 C994A) results in a catalytically inactive Herc5 incapable of supporting ISG15 conjugation. Co-transfection of ISG15 with the mutant forms of its conjugating enzymes prevents ISGylation of target proteins; however, a low level of ISGylation may be observed when using a mutant form of only one of the enzymes or leaving out one of the enzymes (Fig. 1). This is due to a basal level of each of the conjugating enzymes and varies depending on the cell line used in the experiment (29).\n",

            "text": "Several proteomics studies, together, identified approximately 300 cellular proteins that are targeted for ISGylation (28, 30\u201333). This raised the question of how a single ligase, Herc5, could recognize such a diverse set of proteins that shared no apparent distinguishing features. In addressing this problem, we discovered that the range of substrates went far beyond those identified by proteomics, and that nearly all proteins tested, including foreign proteins (bacterial, yeast, viral) could be ISGylated, provided that they were being synthesized in the same window of time that the conjugation system was active (34). The ISGylation of newly synthesized proteins suggested that modification might occur cotranslationally. We discovered that endogenously expressed Herc5 (as well as HA-tagged Herc5) cofractionated with polysomes. In addition, a mutant lacking the N-terminal RCC repeats and incapable of supporting ISGylation of target proteins did not cofractionate with polysomes. With the discovery that Herc5 fractionates with polysomes, we proposed that Herc5 modifies proteins stochastically in a cotranslational manner as they emerge from the ribosome. An implication of this model is that, in interferon-stimulated cells, newly synthesized viral proteins may be the key biologically relevant targets of this system, while modification of cellular proteins may be largely collateral (34).",

Begin harvest of cells no later than 24 h posttreatment (see\nNote 5).2  h before harvesting cells, pour linear 7\u201347% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 200 \u03bcg/mL cycloheximide. Label a 50 mL tube for each sucrose concentration (7, 27.5, and 47%) and add cycloheximide to each tube (total volume will depend on the number of gradients being made). Using a 10 mL sterile plastic pipette, transfer 7% sucrose to the 50 mL tube. The same pipette can be used to then transfer the 27.5% and 47% sucrose. Cap tubes, gently swirl to mix, and place on ice. Using a 5 mL sterile plastic pipette (one forw each sucrose concentration and pipette filler, layer sucrose in 13.2 mL polyallomer centrifuge tubes): first add 3.5 mL 47% sucrose, followed by 3.7 mL 27% sucrose, and end with 3.7 mL 7% sucrose (see\nNote 6). Parafilm each tube and gently lay horizontally at 4\u00b0C for a minimum of 1.5 h to achieve a linear gradient.24 h Postinterferon treatment or transfection, replace the culture media with DMEM  +  FBS  +  CHX and incubate for 30 min.Wash cells in ice-cold PBS  +  CHX and transfer to a 15 mL tube with screw cap.

Some cell lines contain a low basal level of these enzymes.ISG15 conjugates do not accumulate to appreciable levels until \u223c18 h after IFN stimulation. This corresponds to the delayed induction of the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes (29).Typically, ISG15 conjugates migrate between \u223c45 kDa and well over 200 kDa, whereas unconjugated ISG15 migrates at \u223c15 kDa. In order to detect both free and conjugated ISG15, a 12% (or higher) polyacrylamide gel must be used. In addition, using a semidry transfer apparatus increases detection of ISG15 conjugates.An HA-tag is preferable because it has no lysine residues that might serve as ISG15 acceptors. The FLAG tag has two lysines, and a larger protein tag, like the TAP tag, contains many. Further, the \u201cempty\u201d TAP tag (two copies of protein A, one copy of calmodulin binding protein) is itself ISGylated (34).At the time of harvest, cells should be 80\u201390% confluent. As cells approach confluency, there is a reduction in polysomes and increase in monosomes (80S).In order to maintain the interface between each sucrose concentration, hold the polyallomer tube at 45\u00b0 angle as the sucrose is added. The tip of the pipette should be touching the tube while slowly adding the sucrose so that it runs down the inside of the tube.The expression of endogenous Herc5 is much lower than transfected Herc5. TCA precipitate \u223c500 \u03bcL of each gradient fraction for endogenous Herc5 and \u223c150 \u03bcL of each fraction for transfected Herc5.Any remaining TCA may alter the pH of your sample. One option is to wash the pellet with 500 \u03bcL acetone and centrifuge for 5 min at 16,300  \u00d7  g at 4\u00b0C before resuspending in 1\u00d7 protein loading buffer. Alternatively, NaOH can be added to each sample after resuspension of the pellet in 1\u00d7 protein loading buffer.To detect endogenous or transfected Herc5, use an 8% polyacrylamide gel.\n",
