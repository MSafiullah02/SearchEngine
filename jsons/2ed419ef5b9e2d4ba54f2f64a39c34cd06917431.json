Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 2613 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to February 2011 (a period of 3.5 years). The demographics and clinical presentations of patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV were compared. A total of 135 samples were positive for hMPV (positive detection rate: 5.2%). Co-infection with other viruses was observed in 45.9% (62/135) of cases, and human bocavirus was the most common additional respiratory virus. The most common symptoms included cough, fever, and wheezing. The M gene was sequenced for 135 isolates; of these, genotype A was identified in 72.6% (98/135) of patients, and genotype B was identified in 27.4% (37/135) of patients. The predominant genotype of hMPV changed over the 3.5-year study period from genotype A2b to A2b or B1 and then to predominantly B1. Most of clinical features were similar between patients infected with different hMPV genotypes. These results suggested that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Changsha. The hMPV subtypes A2b and B1 were found to co-circulate. The different hMPV genotypes exhibit similar clinical characteristics.",

The present study revealed a rather high mixed infection of hMPV with other viruses (45.9%) and HBOV was the most frequently detected virus with hMPV. The rates of hMPV coinfection of previous studies range from approximately 9.4% to 70.8% [Zhu et al., 2011; Fathima et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2014] , and the commonly codetected viruses include RSV, HRV and PIV-3. These discrepancies are most likely due to the differences in the types of viruses examined and the test methods employed in the studies. However, the discrepancies may also be related to the selection of research objects, geographic regions and research periods. Previous studies have indicated that mixed infection may aggravate the diseases and affect prognosis [Greensill et al., 2003 ]. In the present study, lung auscultation did reveal that rhonchi were more common in patients with mixed hMPV infection compared with patients with single hMPV infection. However, no other significant differences were found between the patients, including the requirement of supplemental oxygen and duration of hospitalization.",

The annual distribution indicated that genotype A2 and genotype B1 prevailed alternately. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of certain predominant hMPV genotypes in a given year. hMPV sub-genotypes may vary in different years and alternative predominance of hMPV sub-genotypes has been observed [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Pitoiset et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013] . The present study found that the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features were fundamentally similar among patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV, which is consistent with the results of some studies [Bosis et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2013] . Diarrhea was a clinical manifestation that occurred more frequently in patients infected with type B hMPV compared with patients infected with type A hMPV in this study. However, there are different epidemiological and clinical findings in other two studies [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012] . Furthermore, a study indicated that patients with type A hMPV infection are often associated with more severe symptoms [Vicente et al., 2006] . However, there is no apparent link between the genotype of hMPV and the severity factors of the disease in other studies [Agapov et al., 2006; Pitoiset et al., 2010] . Certainly, more data are needed to elucidate this issue.",
