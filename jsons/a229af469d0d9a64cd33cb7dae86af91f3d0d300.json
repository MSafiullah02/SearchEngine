It moves on to share the decade of efforts in promoting teachers' learning and their subsequent teaching of the nature of science (NOS). Among these efforts, two teacher professional development programmes received overwhelmingly positive views from teachers in terms of developing their understanding about NOS and scientists. Both programmes provided teachers with special encounters with world-renowned local scientists. The first encounter was an in-depth case study of the authentic scientific enquiry in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in which Hong Kong scientists played a crucial role in many important research findings about SARS. This included the identification of the SARS-coronavirus as the causative agent, and the subsequent sequencing of the virus. Video clips of interviews of the scientists involved in the fight against the deadly disease provided information about the various key events that happened during the SARS crisis. The second encounter was a personal sharing of the research journey of a local scientist, Professor Dennis Lo, who recently achieved a breakthrough in deciphering the fetal genome through analysing trace amounts of fetal DNA in the mother's blood.",

The curriculum advocates scientific investigation as a desired means of learning scientific knowledge, and highlights the development of enquiry practices and generic skills. It was the first local science curriculum that emphasized understanding of some features of nature of science, for example, \"the evolutionary nature of scientific knowledge\" (CDC, 1998, p. 3) . In the first topic, \"What is science?\" teachers are expected to discuss with students some features about science such as its scope and limitations, some typical features about scientific investigations, fair testing, control of variables, predictions, hypotheses, inferences, and conclusions.",

In other words, local curriculum developers have subscribed to the important goals of learning NOS commonly advanced by advocates in the field of science education, for example, the utilitarian, democratic, cultural, moral, and science learning arguments put forward by Driver, Leach, Miller, and Scott (1996) .",

            "text": "Based on the literature and our local context, we identified a host of problems and challenges to tackle in encouraging and training teachers to teach NOS. In particular, we have been cognizant of the disappointing conclusions that were consistently reached by various studies. That is, both students and science teachers have inadequate understanding of NOS (Lederman, 1992) and STSE (Rubba & Harkness, 1993) . There is, however, emerging empirical evidence that can inform efforts to improve NOS and STSE understandings. Explicit and reflective approaches in teaching NOS can support learner development of sophisticated NOS ideas (Abd-El-Khalick & Lederman, 2000; Khishfe & Abd-El-Khalick, 2002) . Teachers with good understanding in NOS still face many constraints including concerns for student abilities and motivation (Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998; Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992) , lack of pedagogical skills in teaching NOS , and lack of teaching resources particularly those in local contexts and language (Tsai, 2001) . Effective NOS teaching also depends on teachers' belief in the importance of teaching NOS (Lederman, 1999; Tobin & McRobbie, 1997) and their conception of appropriate learning goals and teaching roles (Bartholomew, Osborne, & Ratcliffe, 2004) . On top of the problems identified above, Hong Kong teachers very rarely have experienced learning of NOS during their own schooling. Noting teachers' inadequate NOS understanding and hence their lack of appreciation and less than effective use of the NOS instructional materials, science educators at the University of Hong Kong then restructured our teacher training programmes to allow more time on these aspects. In the early 2000's, we attempted to use science stories, such as the discovery of penicillin, the development of cowpox, Newton's proposition of the Law of Universal Gravitation, and the treatment of stomach ulcers (Tao, 2002) , as a medium through which NOS could be introduced to students. However, due to the lack of both understanding of NOS, and experience in learning and teaching NOS, many teachers made use of them only for arousing the students' interest. Hence, the availability of teaching resources would not by itself result in teachers' learning of NOS and an effective teaching of NOS. Unless teachers had the ability to understand and appreciate the rationale behind the design of the instructional materials, it was likely that they would overlook or miss the targeted learning objectives (learning NOS features) and gravitate toward the parts which were more appealing to them (dramatic stories which promote student's interest). Such a situation was reflected in the comment made by a junior science teacher who had been telling interesting science stories to his students. He came to realise his oversight of not having made good use of the stories for teaching NOS after he attended our NOS training workshop: I found the story on stomach ulcers very interesting....Marshall tested his hypothesis by trialling out himself...students all enjoyed the story...I only realise now that there are deeper meanings behind the story and other important learning outcomes to be achieved through it and other stories.",

The SARS incident was a unique experience that everyone in Hong Kong had lived through and the memories of which would stay for years to come. At the beginning of the outbreak, the causative agent was not known, the pattern of spread was not identified, mortality and morbidity soared, yet an effective treatment was uncertain. It attracted the attention of the whole world as scientists worked indefatigably to understand the biology of the disease, develop new diagnostic tests, and design new treatments. Extensive media coverage kept people up to date on the latest development of scientific knowledge generated from the scientific enquiry about the disease. We believed that the incident could be used to reveal many interesting aspects about NOS. Such aspects could be based on: the interviews with key scientists who played an active role in SARS research, analysis of media reports, documentaries, and other literature published during and after the SARS epidemic. The SARS incident illustrated vividly some NOS features advocated in the school science curriculum. These included the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific enquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social, and cultural practices. The incident also provided insights into a number of NOS features less emphasized in the school curriculum. These features included the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty, the courage to challenge authority, and the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research.",

The SARS story was particularly successful in promoting teachers' understanding of NOS in terms of (i) the realization of inseparable links between science and the social, cultural and political environment, (ii) deeper understanding of how science and technology impact on each other, and (iii) a richer appreciation of the processes of authentic scientific enquiry and the humanistic character of scientists. The effectiveness was mainly attributed to immediacy, relevance and familiarity of the SARS story, which made the abstract tangible.

Although he did more than adequate in the area of research for graduation with numerous publications, his goal had not yet been achieved. The tiny amount of the fetal cells (of the order of 1 fetal cell per million maternal cells) in the maternal blood did not allow him to arrive at a simple and robust method for routine non-invasive prenatal diagnosis through taking the mother's blood. Lo continued to work on the same area of research in the Oxford Medical School as academic staff. In late 1996, Lo received a job offer from the medical school at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. While getting himself prepared for the move back home to Hong Kong, he was reflecting on his work in between the 1989 demonstration of the presence of fetal cells in maternal blood using a modern molecular method, and the various approaches he had tried in the past years in improving the detection of the fetal cells. He asked himself, \"what have I been doing wrong for not solving the problem?\" During this time of reflection, he came across two papers published in Nature Medicine in 1996, reporting that the DNA of tumours could be found in the plasma of cancer patients. He realised the parallel between a tumour and a fetus in the mother's womb and thought, \"A fetus is similar to a tumour living inside a mother's body. Furthermore, a fetus in the later stages of pregnancy can be some 8 pounds and is much larger than any tumour that I have seen. Would the fetus release fetal DNA into the plasma of the mother?\"",

Unlike detecting sexlinked diseases which rely on a differentiation of the presence or absence of certain sex-linked DNA, this time it was the challenge of detecting an extra copy of the chromosome 21 in a baby with Down Syndrome. In 2007, Lo calculated that according to the ratio of 95% maternal DNA versus 5% fetal DNA in the maternal plasma, one would have to develop a DNA test that can tell a 2.5% difference in the amounts of chromosome 21. At that time, such a precision was thought by many scientists to be very difficult to achieve, if at all. Lo proposed that one way to solve this problem was to use methods that would allow one to count DNA molecules, one by one. By 2008, the development of a new generation of DNA sequencers allowed millions of DNA molecules to be counted rapidly. In late 2008, Lo's research group and a group in Stanford University independently demonstrated and published that the use of such sequencers could indeed allow the robust non-invasive prenatal detection of Down Syndrome. Lo then asked more ambitious questions, \"How far can we push forward this technology? Is the entire fetal genome present? If yes, can we obtain the entire fetal genome from maternal blood?\" He shared in a light-hearted manner with the audience the inspiration he finally got after months of pondering from watching the 3D opening of the movie, Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince.

So we could first focus on those fragments of DNA sequences inherited from the dad, i.e. sequences that are only present in the father's genome but absent in the mother's. For the mother bit, it's more challenging as they will be mixing with that of the mother's fragmented sequences in her plasma. For those mom's sequences which are inherited by the baby, it will have a slightly greater quantity than those not passing to the baby, and we now have technology to differentiate such a small difference in quantity! In his explanation of the complex idea, he used a jigsaw puzzle representing the genome of the baby with some pieces with distinctive features of sharp colour which are easily noticed to represent the sequences from the father's genome.
