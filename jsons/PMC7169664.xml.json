            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) cause at least 2 million deaths a year (Guerrant & Blackwood 1999; WHO 2002). They are the leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the world and the biggest cause of disability\u2010adjusted life years lost (DALYs) (Murray & Lopez 1997). It was estimated that 21% of deaths in the 42 countries with the highest mortality are because of pneumonia (Black et al. 2003). Mortality and morbidity is concentrated in the under\u2010fives and in the poorer countries (WHO 2002). Efforts are needed to identify interventions against ARIs if the international community is to achieve the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two\u2010thirds by 2015 (Jones et al. 2003). Hands are known to transport bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Microbiological studies have identified respiratory pathogens on hands (Hendley et al. 1973; Reed 1975; Gwaltney & Hendley 1978; 1978, 1980; Ansari et al. 1991) and fomites (environmental surfaces) are also implicated in the transmission chain (Mahl & Sadler 1975; Bean et al. 1982; Brady et al. 1990). Several viruses that were believed to use airborne or fomite routes exclusively are now thought also to be transmitted faeco\u2010orally. Enteric adenoviruses are responsible for 2\u201324% of respiratory viral disease in children (Cherry 1998). The coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is readily isolated from the faeces of infected patients (WHO 2003a, 2003b) and H5N1, the Asian \u2018flu virus, has recently been found in faeces (de Jong et al. 2005). Carriage of pathogens on the hands is an important link in the faecal\u2013oral route of disease transmission. Hands are thus disease vectors: carrying respiratory micro\u2010organisms shed from the nose, mouth or anus to the nasal mucosa, conjunctiva (Hendley et al. 1973), or mouth (WHO 2003b) of new hosts. Hands can be cleansed of viruses and bacteria by washing with soap (both plain and antibacterial) (Faix 1987; Ansari et al. 1989; Luby et al. 2001; Gibson et al. 2002; Montville et al. 2002; Larson et al. 2003) or other cleansers (Hoque & Briend 1991; Kaltenthaler et al. 1991; Hoque et al. 1995; Dyer et al. 2000; 2001, 2003). Furthermore, handwashing is known to reduce respiratory infection in healthcare settings (Isaacs et al. 1991; Falsey et al. 1999; Makris et al. 2000).",

Some major studies were also excluded. All of the studies included in the review had methodological flaws. Of the eight intervention studies, only two (Ladegaard & Stage 1999; Roberts et al. 2000) were RCT. Though all used a control group, only one used a placebo intervention to blind investigators and participants to the study hypotheses (White et al. 2001). Only one dealt with clustering and the non\u2010independent nature of subsequent illness episodes correctly in the analysis (Roberts et al. 2000). Only three studies gave an adequate description of the outcome measure (Niffenegger 1997; Roberts et al. 2000; Ryan et al. 2001). Very few reported a baseline risk of respiratory infections (Niffenegger 1997; Ryan et al. 2001) and most gave unsatisfactory case definitions (Niffenegger 1997; Ryan et al. 2001; White et al. 2001). There were too few studies to carry out subgroup analyses to determine which hand cleansing regimes were most effective. Few studies offered compliance data, and those that did showed low values (Roberts et al. 2000; White et al. 2003). It may be that handwashing, when complied with, can have a much bigger impact than reported in these studies.",

The poor geographical distribution of studies is surprising and may reflect the fact that in the US handwashing is commonly believed to protect against colds and flu, but not elsewhere (anecdotal evidence). Most studies concerned upper respiratory infections such as colds and influenza and few included patients with serious illness. This means that extrapolating the results of this review to developing countries, and to the severe pneumonias which are responsible for most ARI deaths in those settings, is uncertain. On the other hand, the fact that the pooled studies referred to communal settings may be relevant to the often more crowded and communal aspects of life in poorer settings within developing countries.",

This is impressive, but possibly not surprising, given the substantial body of evidence that handwashing can cut the risk of microbial and viral hand contamination and prevent nosocomial infection. This study adds evidence to a pattern of findings suggesting that ARIs and other contagious illnesses can be prevented by handwashing. These include microbiological studies, hospital\u2010based studies and studies concerning other infections (Curtis & Cairncross 2003). Huge sums have been spent on the search for effective counter\u2010measures to ARIs, especially to develop vaccines against influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Hib B, SARS (Chin et al. 1969; Fulginiti et al. 1969; Osterhaus & De Vries 1992) and now Asian \u2018flu.
