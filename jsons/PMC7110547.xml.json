            "text": "Given that animal pathogens (in particular viruses) are considered a significant source of emerging human infections (Cleaveland et al., 2001), the identification and optimal characterisation of novel organisms affecting both domestic and wild animal populations is central to protecting both human and animal health. Recent outbreaks of human infection caused by influenza H7N7 virus transmitted from poultry (Koopmans et al., 2004) and H1N1 virus transmitted from pigs (Dawood et al., 2009, Itoh et al., 2009) are cases in point, highlighting the need for ongoing, vigilant epidemiological surveillance of such pathogens in animal populations. Moreover, epidemiological studies strongly suggest that novel infectious agents remain to be discovered (Woolhouse et al., 2008) and may be contributing to a host of cancers, autoimmune disorders, and degenerative diseases in humans (Relman, 1999, Dalton-Griffin and Kellam, 2009). Similar, yet-to-be-identified viruses may be contributing to the pathogenesis of similar diseases in animals.",

In human medicine they have been used to characterise SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2003), and to identify novel coronaviruses and rhinoviruses in asthmatics (Kistler et al., 2007), gammaretrovirus in prostate tissue (Urisman et al., 2006) and cardioviruses in the gastro-intestinal tract (Chiu et al., 2008).",

The method does have limitations however, as the process of interpreting hybridisation signals is not a trivial one, often involving the empirical characterisation of signals produced by known viruses and the development of specialised software (Urisman et al., 2005). Furthermore, microarray techniques utilise probes with a finite specificity for a particular pathogen or small group of pathogens so that novel or highly divergent strains or viruses can be difficult to detect. Non-specific binding of test material to hybridisation probes can also result in loss of test sensitivity. Despite these limitations, microarrays have proven extremely effective in novel pathogen discovery.",

SISPA was used first to sequence the norovirus genome from human faeces (Matsui et al., 1991), in addition to an astrovirus (Matsui et al., 1993) and a rotavirus (Lambden et al., 1992) infecting humans. Originally the SISPA method involved endonuclease digestion of DNA, followed by directional ligation of an asymmetric adaptor or primer on to both ends of the DNA molecule (Reyes and Kim, 1991). Common end sequences of the adaptor allowed the DNA to be amplified in a subsequent PCR reaction using a complementary single primer. Due to the low complexity of a viral genome, enzymatic digestion produces a large amount of a limited number of fragments. After amplification these are visible as discrete bands on an agarose gel and can be sequenced and identified (Allander et al., 2001). Since animal and bacterial genomes are larger and more complex, restriction digestion generates many different-sized fragments, the amplification of which can result in \u2018smears\u2019 on agarose gel.",

Enriching methods that reduce such \u2018background\u2019 genomic material include filtration, ultra-centrifugation, density-gradient ultra-centrifugation and enzymatic digestion of non-viral nucleic acids using DNAse and RNAse (Delwart, 2007). These techniques take advantage of the differential protection afforded to the virus genome by nucleocapsids and capsids. However, as viral nucleic acid not protected by such capsids is removed by the purification process and not amplified, some potential assay sensitivity is lost. Furthermore, the random nature of the amplification reaction means that great care must be taken to maintain PCR integrity and prevent cross-contamination.",

This method is based on the DNA polymerase-dependent synthesis of a complementary DNA strand in the presence of natural 2\u2032-doexynucleotides (dNTPs) and 2\u2032,3\u2032-didoexynucleotides (ddNTPs) that serve as non-reversible synthesis terminators (Sanger et al., 1977). A limitation of this technique in terms of virus identification can be the requirement to clone viral sequences into bacteria prior to sequencing, although direct sequencing of PCR products can also be employed. When cloning is performed using this method, host-related bias can occur (Hall, 2007), and, as only a relatively limited number of clones can be sequenced, methods to enrich for virus prior to amplification are required.",

A method known as transcriptome subtraction has been developed for viral discovery (Weber et al., 2002) with the advantage that it can be performed without the need for enrichment or amplification (Fig. 2B). Transcriptome subtraction is based on the principal that genes are transcribed (expressed) to produce mRNA, which can be converted in vitro to single-stranded DNA product complementary DNA (cDNA). The sequencing of this cDNA, rather than genomic DNA, therefore allows the transcribed portion of the genome to be analysed.

After aligning and subtracting human sequences against databases, non-matched virus-enriched sequences will remain and can be further studied.

This technique has the advantage of being able to identify very small amounts of virus, as in the case of the polyomavirus detailed above, only 10 viral transcripts/cell were present. Given that each cell contains approximately 1 million host transcripts, only a small proportion of the cellular RNA is virus-derived. Providing every cell is infected, even at very low levels, 10 million sequence \u2018reads\u2019 gives a >99.99% probability of detecting at least one viral sequence (Fig. 3\n). Such a large number of reads is readily obtainable using next generation technology such as the Illumina platform.

Enrichment may result in decreased assay sensitivity, and amplification can generate bias towards a dominant sequence; (B) Transcriptome subtraction methods can be performed without enrichment or amplification with direct sequencing of nucleic acids extracted from a sample of interest. Subsequent subtraction of resulting sequences from databases facilitates virus identification.",
