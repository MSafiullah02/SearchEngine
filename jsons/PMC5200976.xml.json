The time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. The main reason for choosing this period was reviewing only new findings. After removing duplicated records, one hundred and thirty papers were selected, and their contents were subsequently reviewed through title and abstract screenings. The flow diagram of our search steps was presented in Figure 1. All original articles which had evaluated effectiveness or compliance of the vaccines administered in the Hajj were included in the study and non-English articles were excluded from the study. Considering our objectives to discuss the common vaccines which administered to pilgrims and since there is other under review vaccines which most Hajj researchers do not agree with their usages, we excluded the papers of the vaccines which were evaluated only in one paper. Two review authors extracted data independently from each study regarding authors, type of vaccine, published year, journal, type of study, location of study, pilgrims\u2019 nationality, and a number of participants [Tables 2 and 3]. In the next step, the highlighted points were synthesized according to the objectives of our research. No further assessment was performed regarding the quality of the reviewed manuscripts, and the credit of journals was considered sufficient.",

Twenty-four patients (75%) in the case group and 48 participants (76.2%) in the control group were vaccinated (P = 0.898).[21] Moreover, Deris et al. assessed the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine on acute respiratory symptoms of Malaysian pilgrims but found no effect of the vaccine on respiratory symptoms.[22] Furthermore, Memish et al. studied pilgrims from different countries based on their history of pandemic influenza A vaccination and respiratory infections. The frequency of respiratory infections was higher among people who did not vaccinate compared to those who vaccinated (P = 0.009) [Table 2].[23]",
