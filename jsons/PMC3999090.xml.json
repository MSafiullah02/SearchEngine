            "text": "Arenaviruses and hantaviruses are rodent-borne, negative-sense RNA viruses that cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans (Buchmeier et al., 2007, Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007). Most pathogenic arenaviruses are associated with severe hemorrhagic fever syndromes in humans. Examples include the New World arenaviruses Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV), which are the etiologic agents of Argentine, Bolivian, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers, respectively, as well as Lassa virus (LASV), an Old World arenavirus that causes Lassa fever along the coast of West Africa (Buchmeier et al., 2007). Additionally, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can cause aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals and is a potent teratogen (Buchmeier et al., 2007). LCMV and Dandenong virus (DANV), an LCMV-like virus, are also responsible for a nearly uniform lethality in immunosuppressed recipients of virus-infected tissues (Fischer et al., 2006, Palacios et al., 2008). Hantaviruses cause two human illnesses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the Old World and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the New World (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007). Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV) are the primary etiologic agents of HCPS in North and South America, respectively, and are associated with a fatality rate of 35%\u201339% (da Rosa Elkhoury et al., 2012, MacNeil et al., 2011). US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or effective antivirals do not currently exist for the prevention and/or therapeutic treatment of arenavirus or hantavirus disease.",

Each GP is encoded as a precursor (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into mature subunits. The arenavirus GPC is posttranslationally modified to yield a stable signal peptide (SSP) as well as GP1 and GP2 subunits (Lenz et al., 2001), whereas the hantavirus GPC is cotranslationally processed into G1 and G2 subunits (L\u00f6ber et al., 2001). In each case, the GP subunits form a mature GP complex (SSP-GP1-GP2 for arenaviruses; G1-G2 for hantaviruses) that facilitates receptor binding and entry (Buchmeier et al., 2007, Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007).",

Herein, we utilized a proteomics approach to comprehensively identify human proteins that interact with GPs encoded by a prototypic arenavirus or hantavirus. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), an intracellular cargo receptor that facilitates the anterograde transport of a limited number of glycoprotein ligands in the early exocytic pathway (Appenzeller et al., 1999), has a conserved interaction with GPs encoded by multiple families of RNA viruses and is essential for the formation of infectious arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus particles in a GP-specific manner. Our results suggest that loss of ERGIC-53 or its functionality leads to the formation of GP-containing virions that are defective in their ability to attach to permissive host cells.",

            "text": "To identify human proteins that associate with arenavirus and hantavirus GPs, we used an approach that featured affinity purification (AP) of biotinylated viral proteins (LCMV GP to represent arenaviruses or ANDV GP for hantaviruses) in complex with host proteins, followed by mass spectrometry to identify host protein partners as described in Figure S1A and the Supplemental Experimental Procedures (available online). We identified a number of host proteins that associated with LCMV GP (n = 309), ANDV GP (n = 134), or both GPs (n = 51) (Figures 1\nA\u20131C, S1B, and S1C; Tables S1A\u2013S1C). As shown in Figure S1D and Table S1D, host proteins that associated with both GPs were enriched for processes involving the ER, protein folding, and vesicular transport. The LCMV GP-only partners were enriched for processes that included the ER, the proteasome, and nuclear import, while the ANDV GP-only partners were enriched for protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We were particularly interested in the subset of proteins that interacted with both GPs, as they could serve as broad-spectrum antiviral targets. Of these, we chose ERGIC-53 for further study based upon several criteria. First, the ERGIC-53-viral GP interaction is physiologically plausible (e.g., each protein traffics within the exocytic pathway); ERGIC-53 is a mannose-specific lectin (Itin et al., 1996) and the viral GPs are mannosylated (Schmaljohn et al., 1986, Wright et al., 1990). Second, based on its identification as a cargo receptor within the exocytic pathway (Appenzeller et al., 1999), we hypothesized that ERGIC-53 could be required for GP maturation and therefore might be critical for viral propagation. Finally, ERGIC-53 is an attractive target because loss of this protein or its normal function is well tolerated both in vitro (Mitrovic et al., 2008, Nyfeler et al., 2006, Vollenweider et al., 1998) and in vivo (Khoriaty et al., 2012).",

Each viral GP tested, when serving as bait, was able to coprecipitate ERGIC-53 (Figures 1D, 1F\u20131H, S1E, and data not shown). Likewise, ERGIC-53 was able to coprecipitate each GP screened (Figures 1E, 1I\u20131K, S1F\u2013S1I, and data not shown). For the arenavirus GPs, only the full-length GPC was coprecipitated as prey. A full-length hantavirus GPC cannot be recovered, as this protein is cotranslationally cleaved into G1 and G2 subunits prior to synthesis of a full-length GPC species (L\u00f6ber et al., 2001). As shown in Figure 1L, we further verified the specificity of the ERGIC-53-JUNV C#1 GP interaction by showing that both proteins strongly colocalize within a structure that we putatively identify as the ERGIC; both proteins also preferentially concentrate in this structure.",

There was no difference in the formation of infectious VSV\u0394G particles decorated with native VSV G between the WT and DN ERGIC-53 backgrounds (Figures 3\nA and S3A). This may be due to the fact that VSV G does not associate with ERGIC-53 in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Figures 3E and 3F). The formation of infectious VSV\u0394G decorated with JUNV XJ GP was significantly impaired in cells expressing DN ERGIC-53 compared to the WT ERGIC-53 cells (80% reduction; p = 0.001) (Figures 3B and S3B). These experiments demonstrate that ERGIC-53\u2019s impact on arenavirus propagation is specific and can be minimally restricted to the GP itself. Importantly, the fact that ERGIC-53 does not associate with VSV G demonstrates the specificity of its interaction with arenavirus and hantavirus GPs.",

Cells expressing WT or DN ERGIC-53 were infected with JUNV C#1 and screened for surface expression of JUNV C#1 GP. Interestingly, GP surface staining was equivalent in both the WT and DN ERGIC-53 transfected cells in terms of the frequency of cells with GP expression (46% WT versus 47% DN) as well as the intensity of GP staining (median fluorescence intensity [MFI] of 348 for WT versus 363 for DN) (Figure 4\nB). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed a similar result (Figure 4A). The DN ERGIC-53 had no impact on the ability of hTfR1, the surface receptor required for GP-mediated JUNV entry into host cells (Radoshitzky et al., 2007), to traffic to the cell surface (Figure S4).

We found no discernible difference in the quantity of viral proteins (GP1, nucleoprotein [NP], or Z) released from LMAN1\n+/+ or LMAN1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure 4D), despite a nearly 10-fold reduction in infectious virus titer from LMAN1\n\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure 4E). Additionally, the LMAN1\n\u2212/\u2212-derived particles contained viral genomic RNA with a 6.4-fold higher ratio of genome to infectious virus compared to LMAN1\n+/+ particles (Figure 4F). Lastly, the LMAN1\n\u2212/\u2212 particles also exhibited a specific defect in attachment to host cells (52% reduction compared to LMAN1\n+/+ particles) (Figure 4G). In summary, loss of ERGIC-53 expression does not impact the ability of JUNV to generate particles containing viral structural proteins or genome, but rather renders the particles themselves noninfectious, due in part to a defect in their ability to attach to permissive host cells.",

We first addressed whether ERGIC-53 trafficking was altered during infection by surface labeling cells with antibodies specific for JUNV C#1 GP and ERGIC-53. We observed discrete JUNV C#1 GP puncta of \u223c200\u2013400 nm at the plasma membrane that we suggest are putative sites of viral assembly and budding (Figure 5\nB). Strikingly, ERGIC-53 formed puncta of the same size, shape, and position as GP (Figure 5B). In contrast, ERGIC-53 was not detectable at the plasma membrane of uninfected cells (Figure 5B). This altered trafficking is specific, as calreticulin (CRT), another Ca2+-binding lectin of the exocytic pathway, did not similarly redistribute to the plasma membrane following infection (Figure 5C). The intracellular distribution of ERGIC-53 did not change between mock- or JUNV C#1-infected cells (Figure 5A). We next captured JUNV particles using an anti-GPC/GP1 antibody and found that ERGIC-53 was detectable in JUNV particles via western blot (Figure 5D). ERGIC-53 also colocalized with JUNV NP in viral particles adhered onto coverslips (Figure S5). Thus, during arenavirus infection, ERGIC-53 traffics to sites of viral assembly and budding and is incorporated into virions.",

As shown in Figure 6\n, of the 11 mutants screened, only the \u0394CRD mutant displayed a defect in binding to JUNV C#1 GP. Interestingly, despite the requirement of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) for binding, the association of ERGIC-53 with JUNV C#1 GP does not appear to be lectin mediated, as mutations that disrupt ERGIC-53\u2019s ability to bind mannose (N156A, D181A, \u0394\u03b22, \u0394\u03b23, and \u0394\u03b24) do not disrupt its interaction with JUNV C#1 GP. Likewise, the association does not appear to require Ca2+ binding (N156A and D181A), oligomerization (\u0394HM), the helix domain (\u0394Helix), or the association of MCFD2 (\u0394\u03b21, \u0394\u03b22, \u0394\u03b23, \u0394\u03b24, and \u0394HM). The \u0394HM and DN ERGIC-53 (KKAA) results also suggest that trafficking beyond the ER is not required for the interaction. Finally, the \u0394CRD, \u0394\u03b24, and \u0394Helix results indicate that the GP-interacting domain on ERGIC-53 lies within the C-terminal 185 amino acids of the CRD (residues 84\u2013269).",

While functional roles have been defined for each viral protein, their interactions with host proteins, and the importance of these interactions for viral replication and disease pathogenesis, remain largely unknown. In the current study, we addressed this deficiency by providing a comprehensive viral GP-human protein interactome map using GPs encoded by a representative arenavirus and hantavirus. We identified ERGIC-53 as a potential antiviral target based upon its ability to associate with GPs encoded by several families of pathogenic RNA viruses and its clear role in the propagation of arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses. We demonstrate that ERGIC-53 is required not for the formation of GP-containing arenavirus particles, but rather for their infectiousness. We also show that ERGIC-53 traffics to sites of arenavirus budding and is incorporated into virions. Finally, we provide insight into the molecular basis for the GP-ERGIC-53 interaction by showing that the C-terminal region of ERGIC-53\u2019s CRD is required for the interaction independent of ERGIC\u2019s ability to oligomerize, traffic, or bind mannose, MCFD2, or Ca2+.",

            "text": "ERGIC-53 is a nonglycosylated, hexameric type I integral membrane protein that functions as a cargo receptor for soluble glycoproteins within the early exocytic pathway. Its lumenal domain contains a CRD with homology to leguminous lectins and mammalian galectins; it selectively binds to high-mannose glycans in a pH- and Ca2+-dependent manner (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004, Appenzeller et al., 1999, Itin et al., 1996). Only five glycoproteins\u2014FV and FVIII (Moussalli et al., 1999, Nichols et al., 1998), the cathepsins C and Z (Appenzeller et al., 1999, Vollenweider et al., 1998), and alpha-1 antitrypsin (Nyfeler et al., 2008)\u2014have been shown to require ERGIC-53 for their efficient anterograde trafficking. Typically, ERGIC-53 captures its cargo proteins in the ER via its lectin activity and releases them in the ERGIC, presumably due to the lower pH of this compartment (Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2004, Appenzeller et al., 1999). In the case of FV and FVIII, MCFD2 is also required for the trafficking of these proteins independent of ERGIC-53 (Zhang et al., 2003). Because ERGIC-53 and MCFD2 directly interact, it has been suggested that they form a mature cargo receptor required for efficient FV/FVIII trafficking (Nyfeler et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2005). Importantly, while loss of ERGIC-53 expression or function impairs movement of its specific ligands, the overall architecture of the exocytic pathway is maintained, and major glycoproteins still traffic normally (Mitrovic et al., 2008, Nyfeler et al., 2006, Vollenweider et al., 1998). Indeed, humans with homozygous null mutations in ERGIC-53 or MCFD2, despite having F5F8D\u2014a condition that features mild to moderate bleeding symptoms due to reduced levels of circulating FV/FVIII (\u223c5%\u201330% of normal) \u2014are generally healthy and lead normal lives, provided they receive FV/FVIII supplementation following trauma (Khoriaty et al., 2012). These observations clearly suggest that ERGIC-53 is dispensable in humans and therefore represents a viable antiviral target.",

We show that, with the exception of the hantavirus GPs, ERGIC-53 preferentially interacts with the uncleaved, precursor GP, but not the proteolytically processed GP subunits (Figures 1I\u20131K, 3H, 3J, S1F\u2013S1H, and data not shown). In the case of the arenaviruses, this finding strongly suggests that the interaction takes place in the ER and/or ERGIC, prior to proteolytic cleavage of GPC into GP1/GP2 by the SKI-1/SP1 protease, which is thought to occur in the Golgi (Lenz et al., 2001, Wright et al., 1990). Indeed, imaging of JUNV C#1-infected cells revealed that GP and ERGIC-53 both concentrate in the ERGIC (Figures 1L and 5A).

Our results demonstrate that while ERGIC-53\u2019s CRD is indeed critical for the interaction, its lectin- and Ca2+-binding functions are completely dispensable (Figures 6 and S6). Consistent with this claim, we also found the interaction to be unaffected by competition with free mannose, manipulation of Ca2+, changes in pH (as low as 5.0), or deglycosylation of the JUNV or ANDV GP (data not shown). In summary, our studies reveal that the molecular basis for ERGIC-53\u2019s interaction with JUNV GP is different from any of its previously characterized partners; only the C-terminal region of ERGIC-53\u2019s CRD (residues 84\u2013269) is critical for the interaction, whereas ERGIC-53\u2019s ability to oligomerize, traffic, or bind mannose, Ca2+, or MCFD2 are not.",

ERGIC-53 preferentially accumulates in the ERGIC and recycles between this compartment and the ER (Ben-Tekaya et al., 2005, Klumperman et al., 1998). Under normal conditions, ERGIC-53 does not appear to traffic beyond the cis-Golgi. However, following its overexpression via plasmid, ERGIC-53 can traffic to the plasma membrane, presumably due to saturation of COPI (Kappeler et al., 1994). JUNV C#1 infection induces a striking redistribution of a portion of the intracellular pool of ERGIC-53 to the plasma membrane, where it strongly colocalizes with GP at putative sites of viral assembly and budding (Figure 5B). Furthermore, ERGIC-53 is packaged into arenavirus particles (Figures 5D and S5), which may indicate that it is required for virion structure and function.",

In support of this idea, infection with the related arenavirus LCMV triggers the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Pasqual et al., 2011), which is known to increase ERGIC-53 expression (Nyfeler et al., 2003). Indeed, LCMV infection of nonhuman primates results in increased transcription of ERGIC-53 (Djavani et al., 2009).

We initially hypothesized that ERGIC-53 was acting as a bona fide cargo receptor required for the anterograde movement of GP out of the ER and ultimately to the plasma membrane. This idea proved incorrect, as expression of the ER-restricted, DN ERGIC-53 mutant had no impact on the ability of GP to reach the plasma membrane (Figures 4A and 4B). Likewise, there was no disruption of either the proteolytic processing of GPC into GP1/GP2 or the ability of these GP species to be incorporated into VLPs (Figure 4C). Additionally, the DN ERGIC-53 mutant had no impact on the ability of WT JUNV C#1 particles to enter cells (Figures 4A and 4B) or on the level of expression of hTfR1 at the plasma membrane (Figure S4). To formally test whether ERGIC-53 is required for the release of viral particles, we challenged normal or ERGIC-53 null cell lines with JUNV C#1 and found similar quantities of viral particles in the supernatants from each cell line (Figure 4D). However, despite equivalent particle release, the null cell-derived particles were \u223c10-fold less infectious (Figure 4E), demonstrating that ERGIC-53 is essential for the infectivity of JUNV C#1 particles. Therefore, in the absence of ERGIC-53, arenavirus particles are produced in normal quantities but are defective in the early phase of replication. Our results suggest that this defect minimally exists at the level of virus attachment to the host cell (Figure 4G). It is possible that this defect may also impair other steps of viral entry, such as endocytic uptake of particles into host cells and/or fusion and release of genome into the cytoplasm (see Figure 7\nfor our proposed model).",

Additionally, less infectious virus was produced in our challenge studies featuring the ER-restricted, DN ERGIC-53 mutant (Figures 2C, 2D, 3B, S2C, S2D, and S3B) or ERGIC-53 siRNA (Figures 2A and S2A). Conversely, overexpression of WT ERGIC-53 leads to increased trafficking of ERGIC-53 to the plasma membrane (Kappeler et al., 1994), which could lead to more ERGIC-53 being incorporated into particles and explain the increased release of infectious virus seen under these conditions (Figures 2B and S2B). Alternatively, ERGIC-53 could be required to traffic and/or recruit cellular proteins that are critically required for virion structure and function or for the proper maturation of the arenavirus GP (e.g., glycan maturation or other posttranslational modifications).",

Furthermore, in the case of the arenaviruses, targeting ERGIC-53 function with an antiviral could be expected to set up an ongoing immunizing therapy, as defective, but presumably immunogenic, viral particles would be released during the course of treatment. While ERGIC-53 represents a potential broad-spectrum antiviral target for arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses, it may also be required for additional human pathogens, such as the New World hantaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, or retroviruses, based upon its conserved interaction with their GPs (Figures 1D, 1E, 3I, 3J, and S1I) (J\u00e4ger et al., 2012), or for DNA viruses, based on the finding that a murine gamma herpes virus was negatively impacted by silencing of ERGIC-53 (Mages et al., 2008). Based on our finding that JUNV propagation is impaired in cells from ERGIC-53 null individuals, future studies should also address whether exposure to rodent-borne viruses, such as the arenaviruses, has exerted a selective pressure to maintain ERGIC-53 mutations within the human population as a means to confer resistance to infection. Additionally, while bleeding is not a major cause of morbidity or mortality during arenavirus or hantavirus infection, it is interesting to consider that viral GPs, by interacting with ERGIC-53, may disrupt ERGIC-53\u2019s normal cargo receptor function for FV and FVIII, contributing to some of the hemorrhagic manifestations seen following infection with these viruses, which can include deficiencies in the levels and/or activity of circulating FV or FVIII (Lee, 1987, Lee et al., 1989, Schwarz et al., 1972). The interaction of ERGIC-53 with the filovirus GPs is particularly intriguing, considering the prominent coagulation abnormalities observed during human infection (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). Finally, our studies and others (Gonzalez-Begne et al., 2009) have shown that ERGIC-53 is actively secreted from cells in viral particles and/or cellular exosomes and strongly suggest that it has important roles outside of its normal distribution within the exocytic pathway, perhaps outside of the cell where, in the case of arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses, it may influence the endocytic pathway-driven process of viral entry.",

The GP on newly formed particles then attaches to its cellular receptor (4), which permits endocytic uptake of particles into endosomes (5), where low pH leads to GP2-mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes and, ultimately, release of viral genome into the cytoplasm (6). In the absence of ERGIC-53 (null) or in the presence of the ER-restricted, DN ERGIC-53 (DN) (bottom half of left cell), GP is still proteolytically processed, trafficked to the plasma membrane, and incorporated, along with other viral structural proteins and viral genome, into budding particles (1\u20133).
