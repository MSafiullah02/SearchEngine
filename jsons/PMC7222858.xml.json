On the other hand, IgE-mediated reactions require repeated exposure to the antigen [8, 12\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022]. The most common HSR due to a monoclonal antibody is an acute infusion\u2013related reaction; nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of these reactions is currently unknown. In addition to common symptoms, patients may display atypical clinical features such as rigor, back pain, and abdominal pain. Mild-to-moderate infusion reactions can be managed by premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines and antipyretics, and slowing infusion rate [14\u2022, 15].",

CRS is caused by the release of cytokines especially TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-6 from monocytes, macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells [16, 17]. Not only monoclonal antibodies but also non-protein-based cancer drugs, stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and severe viral infections can cause CRS. The manifestation of CRS varies from flu-like symptoms to severe life-threatening conditions such as renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and capillary leakage with pulmonary edema. In some cases, death has been reported. The respiratory system is commonly affected, and the manifestations vary from cough and tachypnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome depending on the severity of reaction [18, 19]. Treatment of CRS depends on the severity of the reaction. For mild and moderate reactions, management includes slowing the infusion rate (after a temporary break) and premedication with corticosteroids and acetaminophen. Severe reactions are usually clinically indistinguishable from IgE-mediated reactions, and management is similar to anaphylaxis [13\u2022].",

The binding of antigen-specific IgE to Fc\u03b5RI receptor on the surface of basophils and mast cells leads to the release of mediators such as histamine, platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, tryptase, and prostaglandins. Systemic effects of the mediators are responsible for clinical findings, cutaneous flushing, headache, airway obstruction, and hypotension. In addition, elevated serum levels of these mediators, especially tryptase, are helpful for the differential diagnosis of IgE-mediated reactions [20]. The most severe form of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity is anaphylaxis, defined as severe life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reactions. The clinical manifestations depend on the organ system involved: cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular system [21].",

            "text": "Up to now, more than 400 anaphylaxis cases induced by biological agents, including mAbs, cytokines, and enzymes, have been reported [22]. Commonly, IgE-mediated reactions to drugs occur after a sensitization phase with multiple exposures to the drugs. A few exceptions have been reported on anaphylaxis during first administration of mAbs. Preexisting IgE antibodies against galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) have been identified as the underlying cause of first-dose anaphylaxis for cetuximab and infliximab. Alpha-gal is an oligosaccharide which is found in mammalian meats and Fc fragment and Fab portion of cetuximab heavy chain, Fc fragment of infliximab, and a few other monoclonal antibodies. Lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) bitten patients develop IgE antibodies to alpha-gal. Therefore, first dose of cetuximab or infliximab may cause anaphylaxis [23, 24]. Bueren et al. showed that only alpha-gal present on the Fab domain of cetuximab binds to alpha-gal-specific IgE antibodies of sensitized patients in vitro and no binding to alpha-gal-specific IgE of other alpha-gal containing monoclonal antibodies, basiliximab, palivizumab, zalutumumab, panitumumab, and abatacept or the Fc fragment of cetuximab [25]. However, theoretically, patients sensitized to alpha-gal may experience anaphylaxis to the first dose of biologics which have alpha-gal motif in Fc fragments. Two cases of anaphylactic reactions during the first dose of basiliximab have been reported, but their alpha-gal IgE levels were unavailable [26]. In addition to that, first-dose anaphylaxis to omalizumab has been reported due to polysorbate which is a solubilizing agent used in drugs to stabilize emulsions [27, 28]. Other additives of biological agents such as mannitol, albumin, polysorbate 80, latex, papain, and trometamol may have antigenic potential [29].",

Second-line and third-line treatments consist of oxygen, adequate position, nebulized adrenaline, nebulized beta-2-agonist, intravenous normal saline, corticosteroid, and antihistamine administration depending on the clinical presentations of the patient [6, 21]. Serum tryptase levels should be obtained 30\u2013120 min after the reaction to differentiate anaphylaxis from infusion-related reactions and cytokine release syndrome. The severity of organ involvement such as cardiovascular symptoms is correlated with higher serum tryptase levels. Although elevated serum tryptase levels from baseline suggest mast cell activation, in some cases of anaphylaxis, serum tryptase levels may be within the normal range [30, 31].",

If the drug is unequal or more effective and/or less toxic than alternatives or has a unique mechanism of action, desensitization is indicated for patients who have experienced type 1 or type 4 reactions (except severe cutaneous adverse reactions). Type 2 reactions (immunocytotoxic reactions), vasculitis, type 3 reactions (serum sickness-like syndrome), and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SJS/TEN, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)) are absolute contraindications for desensitization [46]. For patients who have severe respiratory, cardiac, or systemic disease and experienced severe anaphylaxis (requiring intubation), desensitization should be considered after careful assessment of the risks and benefits. Also, patients taking beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors have an increased risk of severe reactions during desensitization [47].",

Antirituximab antibodies develop more frequently in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus than in those with lymphoma [15]. In addition to that, it was shown that infliximab-related reaction rate is higher in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis than in patients who have seronegative spondyloarthritis and vasculitis [61]. These observations can suggest that patients suffering from an autoimmune disease may have an increased risk of HSR. Recently, Soyer et al. showed that renal involvement, frequent hospitalization, and exposure to more than two different biologic agents are risk factors for HSRs in children with rheumatologic diseases [59].",

Development of ADA to infliximab is associated with concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive agents and administration intervals. Patients who take immunosuppressors have lower incidence of ADA to infliximab, and longer intervals between infliximab administrations increase the risk of developing ADA [62]. Therefore, regular infusion regimens should be preferred to reduce HSRs to infliximab [15]. Also, cross-reactivity between TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors is not common, so if the patient has hypersensitivity to infliximab, other TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors such as etanercept or adalimumab may be safe alternative treatment options [31].",

Their complex structures and content of variable amounts of foreign regions may lead to HSRs. Although anaphylaxis is not the most common form of HSR, it may limit the clinical usage of biologic agents. Acute management of anaphylaxis to biologics is similar to that applied to other causes of anaphylaxis, but subsequent administration of the drug remains as a problem to be solved. If the drug is first-line treatment option or more effective than other drugs, desensitization can be performed under supervision of an experienced allergist. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of hypersensitivity reactions to increase safety and efficacy of biologics.",
