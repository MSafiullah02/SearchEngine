The relevance to SARS\u2010CoV pathogenesis becomes an attractive issue for developing anti\u2010SARS therapy. SARS\u2010CoV contains a single positive\u2010stranded RNA genome that is approximately 30 kb in length and has a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 polyA tract [5, 6, 7]. The SARS\u2010CoV genome encodes for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. The replicase gene encodes two large overlapping polypeptides (replicase 1a and 1ab, \u223c450 and \u223c750 kD, respectively), including 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro), RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, and RNA helicase for viral replication and transcription [8]. The SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, thereby playing an important role in viral replication. In the case of picornaviruses, poliovirus, enterovirus 71, and rhinovirus, 3C protease have been demonstrated to cleave specific cellular proteins [9, 10], inhibit the cellular translation [11, 12], and induce cell apoptosis [13, 14, 15]. Recently, SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro cleavage sites have been predicted in cellular proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and transcription factors CREB\u2010RP and OCT\u20101 using computational methods [16], signifying SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro protease can be involved in virus\u2010induced pathology. In this study, we intended to identify potential 3CLpro\u2010interacting cellular protein(s) using the phage\u2010displayed human lung cDNA library.",

For biopanning, the T7Select human lung cDNA library fused at the C terminus of phage capsid protein 10B was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Following the biopanning procedure in our previous report [18], five rounds of biopanning for screening 3CLpro\u2010affinity phage clones were carried out using 3CLpro\u2010coated microplates (5 \u03bcg per well). The 3CLpro\u2010affinity phage clones were eluted with the soluble 3CLpro. For direct ELISA binding assay, the individual eluted phage clones that were determined using a plaque assay were coated onto microplates (1010\np.f.u./well) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking phage\u2010coated plates, 100 \u03bcl of 20 \u03bcg/ml 3CLpro was added to each well for additional 1\u2010h incubation. Bound 3CLpro was detected using the ELISA with the anti\u2010His tag monoclonal antibody and anti\u2010mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to peroxidase (Pharmacia).

            "text": "To examine the cell\u2010based interaction of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro with V\u2010ATPase G1, the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro gene was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1, and then transfected into human promonocyte HL\u2010CZ cells. Western blotting analysis of cell lysates with anti\u2010His\u2010tag antibody demonstrated a major 68\u2010kDa band for the dimer and a minor 34\u2010kDa band in the 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells (not shown here). For further analyzing the binding of cellular V\u2010ATPase G1 to 3CLpro, the cell lysate of the 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells and mock cells was precipitated by anti\u2010His tag antibody to 3CLpro (Fig. 4\nA\u2013C). In the Coomassie\u2010stained gel, the immunoprecipitate by anti\u2010His tag antibody contained many cellular proteins from the 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 4A, lane 6), while only a few proteins from mock cells (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Of the cellular proteins in the immunoprecipitate, a 68\u2010kDa \u2013 immunoreactive band for the dimer 3CLpro was found using Western blotting with anti\u2010His tag antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 6). In addition, Western blot analysis with anti\u2010V\u2010ATPase G1 polyclonal antibodies demonstrated a major 13\u2010kDa band for cellular V\u2010ATPase G1 protein in the 3CLpro\u2010precipitated pellet (Fig. 4C, lane 6). The result confirmed the interaction between 3CLpro and V\u2010ATPase G1 in the HL\u2010CZ cells. Since V\u2010ATPase in the plasma and lysosomal membranes is the major proton\u2010extruding molecule for controlling cytosolic pHi [21, 22], the cytosolic pHi in SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro \u2013 expressing cells and pcDNA3.1\u2010expressing cells was determined by the fluorescence of SNARF\u20101 (Fig. 4D). Cytosolic pHi of SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro \u2013 expressing cells (pHi\n= 7.70 \u00b1 0.002) was significantly lower (t test, P\n< 0.05) than that of pcDNA3.1\u2010expressing cells (pHi\n= 7.79 \u00b1 0.009).",

Co\u2010immunoprecipitation analysis and direct binding affinity demonstrated the specific interaction of 3CLpro with V\u2010ATPase G subunit 1 (2, 4). V\u2010ATPase resides on the membranes of acidic organelles such as secretary granules, lysosomes, and the trans\u2010Golgi network, being the major proton\u2010extruding molecule for maintaining acidic environment [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. V\u2010ATPase is a multisubunit complex with two functional domains, namely, the peripheral V1 domain and the integral V0 domain. V\u2010ATPase G subunit 1 belongs to the accessory V1 subunits, being responsible for ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E5 protein has been demonstrated to bind to the 16\u2010kDa subunit of the vacuolar H(+)\u2010ATPase (16 K) [26], and to inhibit the assembly, stability and complex formation of the V\u2010ATPase [27]. Our findings are in agreement with the previous reports [26, 27] showing that vacuolar H(+)\u2010ATPase can be involved in the virus\u2010induced pathogenesis.",

Meanwhile, a significant intracellular acidification has been demonstrated in the 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 4D). The result correlated well with previous reports in that V\u2010ATPase\u2010specific inhibitors cause acidic pHi [28, 29], and influences cell apoptosis [30, 31]. Recent studies demonstrate the binding interaction of V\u2010ATPase with F\u2010actin, being important for regulating in response to phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase activity [32]. Comparing to the immunoprecipitate of mock cell extract by anti\u2010His tag antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 3), significantly more proteins were precipitated in the 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 4A, lane 6), in which some proteins such as F\u2010actin could be brought down by V\u2010 ATPase G1.",
