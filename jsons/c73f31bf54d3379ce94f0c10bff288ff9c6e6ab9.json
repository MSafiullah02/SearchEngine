As part of the COVID-19 situation, many proposals have been made for scaling up contract tracing capacities with the help of smartphone applications, an important but highly critical endeavor due to the privacy risks involved in such solutions. Extending our previously expressed concern, we clearly articulate in this article, the functional and non-functional requirements that any solution has to meet, when striving to serve, not mere collections of individuals, but the whole of a nation, as required in face of such potentially dangerous epidemics. We present a critical information infrastructure, PriLock, a fully-open preliminary architecture proposal and design draft for privacy preserving contact tracing, which we believe can be constructed in a way to fulfill the former requirements. Our architecture leverages the existing regulated mobile communication infrastructure and builds upon the concept of \"checks and balances\", requiring a majority of independent players to agree to effect any operation on it, thus preventing abuse of the highly sensitive information that must be collected and processed for efficient contact tracing. This is enforced with a largely decentralised layout and highly resilient state-of-the-art technology, which we explain in the paper, finishing by giving a security, dependability and resilience analysis, showing how it meets the defined requirements, even while the infrastructure is under attack.",

Contact tracing (CT), that is the systematic identification of potentially infected individuals by tracing and testing those that had been in contact with a known infected person and where a transmission of the virus may have happened, has been an effective measure to confine the COVID-19 outbreak in the early phase after new year, but ceased to be effective the moment NHS tracing capacities got exhausted. Aside from COVID-19, the effectiveness of CT has been demonstrated in many outbreaks [17, 37, 29, 18] . For example, WHO reports the essential role of CT in controlling Ebola outbreaks in Africa 2 . The goal of digital contact tracing 3 is to automate CT and as such increase NHS tracing capacities by several orders of magnitude to extend the time when CT remains effective in chasing exponentially growing infection rates. However, such a proposal should preserve fundamental needs and goals, some of which hard to reconcile, such as efficiency and effectiveness, as well as coverage, fairness and privacy for population.",

However, in distributed systems logical centralisation does not necessarily imply monopolist trust models, or physical centralisation. Nor decentralisation or peer-to-peer prevent abuses per se. Both misconceptions have been part of recent debates 456 . The PriLock architecture follows best practices in distributed and resilient critical information systems design. It uses geographical decentralisation to reduce the baseline threat plane, both at the periphery and at the core. Its management trust model does not follow a centralised, monopolist philosophy, but a consensual one, where abuse is technically prevented since no operation can be executed by single or minority groups of entities, and all critical operations require intervention of a quorum of the (independent) entrusted entities (\"checks and balances\").",

In the context of this paper, EpiProtect is the designation of the necessary coalition of interest formed by entities of the state -such as relevant government ministries, National Health Service entities like centres for disease control and hospitals, Justice, an independent Regulation body for the CII -and regulated companies, regulators, research and technology institutes and universities, public associations, for example. The PriLock infrastructure, albeit supported by the state, is managed not in a fully centralised way, but in concertation, by several powers exerting mutual control (\"checks and balances\"), in respect for the PII it will store and process. In essence, the PriLock Entrusted Authorities (PEA) is a subset of the entities listed above, whose number and quality/role will depend on specific countries' culture and legal systems. PEA members are those that can collectively issue authorisations for the manipulation of PriLock. As seen below, all such operations must be vetted by a quorum of the PEA. Other entities such as listed above will be PriLock-Associated Entities (ASE ). Figure 1 gives an overview of the architecture. It is worth noting that, following a successful concept in previous research on critical information infrastructures, the technology required is al-ready available (e.g., but not exclusively from the EU projects CRUTIAL 14 , MASSIF 15 , BBC 16 , SEGRID 17 ). PriLock attempts at leveraging (rather than replacing or duplicating) existing CIIs, in this case the legacy Telco and Public Administration infrastructures in general, and the Mobile Communication system in particular. As such, as seen in the Figure, whilst the existing legacy systems are represented in brown, PriLock is laid out as an overlay architecture over them, represented in blue. Furthermore, to ease integration and cause minimal disturbance, PriLock components are highly modular and self contained (information switches, cloud subsystems). This perimeter isolation with very clear entry/exit points (boundaries between brown and blue in the Figure) is also key to security and dependability. As we show ahead, it is strengthened with other defence-in-depth mechanisms in order to attain the very high levels of resilience desired. ",

In cellular networks, small cells are employed to enhance the link quality and network capacity [31] . Several types of small cells include femtocells, picocells, microcells, and macrocells -broadly increasing in size from femtocells which are the smallest, to macrocells which are the largest. The network is normally organised in cells, nominally covering a geographical region, by sets of antennas controlled by the cell Base Station.

Macrocells (standard cells and microcells) implement the external (street) structure, respectively by macrocell Base Stations, mBS. Communication inside premises (e.g., internal parkings, theatres, shopping malls) is secured by additional, finer granularity, picocells, from a given provider, controlled respectively by picocell Base Stations, pBS. These are aggregated under the realm of the macrocell that subtends them, by a hierarchical logical structure, called paging cell. The useful ranges of the pBS of a same paging cell partially overlap in their spatial coverage. A phone will register to a cell upon arrival (e.g., through the macrocell base station mBS), and after that the communication enters stand-by listening mode to save energy. From then on it can be paged by any of the base stations in that paging cell (e.g., walking through a shopping mall) on a need basis (e.g. an incoming call or SMS). The information flow will be detailed in a later section, but a key data structure for the process described below is introduced now: Proximity Detail Record (PDR) -containing, for each region (cell), the timestamps of contiguous periods of time spent in the region by a phone, the average proximity vector from the centroid, plus an encoded ID of the region BS.",

This approach shows a virtuous adaptation of accuracy to human density, providing a predictable rate of false positives grossly proportional to predicted urban density. The approach also promotes inclusion, since: 30% of the population is estimated not to own a smartphone, and most older people are not tech-savvy. Thus, including older people in a system that works automatically for them, and with a predictable rate of false positives grossly proportional to age (and thus health risk) and tech-illiteracy, seems as well a virtuous trade-off for an infrastructure of public interest. From the viewpoint of the national interest, it is also the one offering better reliability, security and sovereignty conditions for a start, since it does not suffer from the considerable threat plane affecting phone-to-phone attacks, or the phone/OS vendor interference (both in GPS and in Bluetooth sensing).

For example, secret sharing [35] prevents unilateral reconstruction of confidential information (e.g., by malicious insiders), erasure coding [26] provides the same property for data integrity, preventing unilateral damage, and deploying such encoded data over mutually distrusting clouds [6, 7] extends these properties to less trustworthy infrastructures (such as public clouds or, as is the case for the PriLock Data Vault, private clouds in the PEA premises to protect this highly-sensitive data at the highest degree possible).",

For example, when searching for suspicious encounters (see finding suspicions on page 17), the incubation time needs to be adjusted to the knowledge epidemiologists have gathered about the current infection. Epidemiology experts are also expected to benefit from post-processed information supplied by PriLock, especially during the active stages of infections and epidemics. However, even though PriLock would rely on established procedures and regulatory frameworks (approval from ethics committees, etc.) to grant access to this information on an urgent need to know basis, by enabling authorized entities to extract sanitized statistical information and pseudomized data sets, we believe further research is required to ensure the protection of citizens rights, in particular privacy, for less urgent needs. One aspect of interaction we wish to highlight here, is the interoperability with systems applied in other countries. PriLock is by design a single nation system in the sense that through PriLock citizens entrust their PII data to the federation of entrusted legal authorities, either elected, or appointed by an elected government, and which form the EpiProtect.
