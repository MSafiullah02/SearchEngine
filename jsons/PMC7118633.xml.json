Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) identified a novel beta-coronavirus called 2019-nCoV, now officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020), that responsible for the pandemic. This was the third zoonotic coronavirus breakout in the first two decades of 21st century that allowing human-to-human transmission and raising global health concerns. Chinese government had taken immediate, transparent and extraordinary measures, and reached initial achievements to control the outbreak. As of 11 March 2020, the pandemic caused accumulated 80955 confirmed cases and 3162 deaths in China, 37364 confirmed cases and 1130 deaths in 113 other countries worldwide. World Health Organization (WHO) deeply concerned the unprecedented swift global spread and severity of the outbreak, and by ignorance and inaction of some countries. Therefore, WHO announced the COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic (WHO, 2020a).",

We summarized all of the four available pathology studies of COVID-19 biopsy and autopsy, and compared the results with previous two deadly coronavirus diseases. New therapeutic measures are emerging one after another. Potential effective treatments were remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible). Evidence-based medicine should always be advocated to guide our clinical decision.",

The onset of first cluster cases were reported an exposure history to the Huanan seafood(wild animal) wholesale market in Wuhan. However, phyloepidemiologic analyses suggested that Huanan market was not the origin of 2019-nCoV. The virus was imported from elsewhere and boosted in the crowded market(Yu et al., 2020). The proportion of infected cases without an exposure history and in health care workers gradually increased. All of the evidence indicated the human-to-human transmission ability of 2019-nCoV, which may already be spread silently between people in Wuhan before the cluster of cases from Huanan market was discovered in late December. Person-to-person transmission may occur mainly through droplet or contact transmission. According to Guan\u2019s latest pilot study, 2019-nCoV was detected positive in the gastrointestinal tract specimens (stool and rectal swabs) as well as in saliva and urine, and even in esophageal erosion and bleeding site of severe peptic ulcer patients(Guan et al., 2020). Four important epidemiological parameters of 2019-nCoV were reviewed in comparison with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(shown in Table 1\n).",

The reproductive number updated along with the development of the outbreak and interventions. R0 was estimated to be around 3 for SARS(Bauch et al., 2005) and <1 for MERS(Bauch and Oraby, 2013). The preliminary R0 of 2019-nCoV was reported as 2.24-3.58(Liu et al., 2020). Several research groups reported estimated R0 of the outbreak depending on distinct estimation methods and the validity of underlying assumptions. Liu et al. (2020) reviewed all of the 12 references of an estimated R0 ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79. In clinical studies, a 425-case study by 22 January 2020, reported an R0 of approximately 2.2(95%CI, 1.4-3.9)(Li et al., 2020), while another 4021-case study by 26 January 2020, estimated 3.77(95%CI, 3.51-4.05) (Yang et al., 2020).

All these literatures lay the foundation to set 14 days as the medical observation period if any exposure occurred. A latest study collected 1099 cases from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in China and declared a median incubation period of 3.0 days, ranging from 0 to surprisingly 24.0 days.

The CFR in Wuhan was undoubtedly higher than CFR outside of Wuhan. The reported CFR ranged 1.4%-3.06% in large nationwide case studies(Guan et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020). Prognosis factors such as male, elderly patients aged\u2265 60 years, underlying disease, severe pneumonia at baseline and a delay from onset to diagnosis >5 days substantially elevated the CFRs(Yang et al., 2020). CFRs in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and respiratory disorders were as high as 10.5%, 7.3%, 6.0% and 6.3%, respectively. According to WHO announcement, SARS accounted for 8096 cases and 774 death, with a CFR of 9.6%(WHO, 2004). MERS-CoV infection were responsible for 2229 cases and 791 death, with a crude CFR of 35.5%(WHO, 2018).

Despite a gradually stable CFR around 3, the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19 was also extraordinarily destructive and causing more death because of its enormous infected population.

Histological examinations of two patients underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma, revealed edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes with only patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration without prominent hyaline membranes. Since both patients didn\u2019t develop symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of surgery, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia. Qian et al. (2020) first reported the pathological characteristics of a patient who died from COVID-19. General observation from raw eyes showed less fibrosis and consolidation, instead more exudative lesions in COVID-19 than SARS. Microscopic examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, indicating ARDS. Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were dominated by lymphocytes. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes showed viral cytopathic-like changes, without obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions. Results from flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the counts of peripheral CD4+ and CD8 + T cells were substantially reduced, while their status were hyper-activated. It indicated the severe immune injury in later stage of COVID-19, but not by virus direct destruction(Xu et al., 2020b). Based on the public database and single-cell RNA-Seq technique, pathological studies revealed that male donors had a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than their female counterparts. The only Asian male specimen has five more times as much as ACE2 expressing on the white and African American donors. This might explain why the 2019-nCov and previous SARS-CoV pandemic were concentrated in the Asian population and a heightened susceptibility of male patients, although more evidence was needed to draw such conclusion(Yu et al., 2020).",

Living 2019-nCoV was also detected positive in stool specimens and rectal swabs of infected patients, indicating possible transmission route of oral-faecal transmission. Proper handling with the infected corpse and disposal of human excreta of infected patients were of great importance(Nicholls et al., 2003). Thrombi were seen in all six autopsies of SARS-CoV infected patients, with even huge thrombus formation in part of pulmonary vessels. Coagulation function disorders were reported in most of the severe COVID-19 patients, by elevated levels of D-Dimer and prolonged prothrombin time, some of whom ended in disseminated intravascular coagulation(Chen et al., 2020a, Huang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a). This may explain some sudden death of clinical recovery patients and serve as an indication for disease severity. In an autopsy study, the only one patient without usage of corticosteroids demonstrated increased CD3+ lymphocyte than five other specimen treated by corticosteroids (Pei and Gao, 2005). It suggested an inhibition of immune system and a careful usage of corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment. Much is to be discovered in more 2019-nCoV autopsies.",

Previous therapies targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may accelerate the development of treatment of COVID-19 because of their structure resemblance and genome similarities. The human monoclonal antibody could efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV and inhibit syncytia formation between S-protein and ACE2 expressing cells(Sui et al., 2004). Appropriate modification of the monoclonal antibody may be effective for treatment of COVID-19. What\u2019s more, potential therapies targeting the renin-angiotensin system, to increase ACE2 expression and inhibit ACE may be developed to treat COVID-19 in the future. Hoffmann et al. (2020) reported a cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV priming upon entrance into cells and viral spread in the infected host cells. The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate against TMPRSS2, can efficiently blocked 2019-nCoV-S-protein-driven cell entry, which could be a promising treatment for 2019-nCoV infection.",

Expectation and attention were shifted to \u201cremdesivir\u201d which may be the most potential wide-spectrum drug for antiviral treatment of 2019-nCoV. Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into novel viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection(Mulangu et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2020b) revealed that remdesivir were highly effective and safe in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells and Huh-7 cells. A successful appliance of remdesivir on the first 2019-nCoV infected case in the United States when the his clinical status was getting worsen, were recently released(Holshue et al., 2020). Animal experiments also showed superiority of remdesivir over lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-\u03b2, by reducing MERS-CoV titers of infected mice and improving the lung tissue damage(Sheahan et al., 2020). The effectiveness and safety of remdesivir can be expected by the clinical trial lead by Dr Bin Cao.",

            "text": "The 2019-nCoV infection is associated with a cytokine storm triggered by over-activated immune system(Huang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020b), similar to SARS and MERS. The aberrant and excessive immune responses lead to a long-term lung function and structure damage in patients survived from ICU. Ongoing trials of IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab, which shown effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, may be expanded to restore T cell counts and treat severe 2019-nCoV infection(Le et al., 2018). The available observational studies and meta-analysis of corticosteroid treatment suggested impaired antibody response, increased mortality and secondary infection rates in influenza, increased viraemia and impaired virus clearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and complications of corticosteroid therapy in survivors(Zumla et al., 2020). Therefore, corticosteroid should not be recommended for treatment of 2019-nCoV, or use on severe patient with special caution. A review on convalescent plasma for treatment of SARS-CoV and severe influenza infection, suggested a reduction in hospital stay and mortality rate, especially when administered early after symptom onset (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015). However, another study demonstrated no significant improvement of convalescent plasma transfusion on survival of Ebola virus infected patients. Possible reasons may be the unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma and transfusion timing(van Griensven et al., 2016). In terms of vaccine, if any cross-reactive epitopes were identified between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, previous vaccine for SARS-CoV might be re-utilized to facilitate 2019-nCoV vaccine development. We recommend an influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination for prophylaxis, especially in elderly adults(Chen et al., 2020b). Both pandemic viruses result in similar respiratory symptoms and hard to distinguish. The 2019-nCoV pandemic initiated in flu season which easy to develop a combination infection of 2019-nCoV and influenza or Streptococcus infection. Vaccination against influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia in vulnerable elderly people with comorbidities are highly cost-effective, which is demonstrated to associate with reductions in the risk of hospitalization and death from all causes during influenza seasons(Nichol et al., 2003).",

Lessons learned from the MERS and SARS outbreaks can provide valuable insight into how to handle the current pandemic. The successful public health outbreak response tactics of Chinese government, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment, can be copied by other countries according to their national situation. As the pandemic is still ongoing and expanding, experiences and research literatures from China and other countries will increase. The 2019-nCoV should be monitored of any possible gene variation of antigenic drift or antigenic conversion, to avoid another round of outbreak. Another lessons from this pandemic will be awe for nature and love for life.",
