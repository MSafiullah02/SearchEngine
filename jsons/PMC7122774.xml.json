            "text": "Chest x-ray (CXR) is still frequently used when pneumonia is suspected or should be ruled out [14, 15]. CXR has several advantages: it is quick, widely available (even on the ward), inexpensive, and associated with a low radiation dose. CXR is occasionally done on the ward to keep neutropenic patients in protective isolation, even if performed in supine position. But CXR has the crucial disadvantage of superimposition and therefore a very limited sensitivity for the detection of pneumonia (Figs. 7.2 and 7.6) [14, 16]. Especially if performed in supine position, lung inflation is worse and lateral projection is lacking, which limits image quality besides other technical issues. In patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) after SCT, digital CXR in supine position achieves a sensitivity for early detection of pneumonia of only 46 % [17]. While CXR provides relevant clinical information concerning central venous catheters (CVC), pleural effusion, and pulmonary congestion [17], it fails to enable early detection or exclusion of pneumonia, which is a major task in immunocompromised hosts. CXR in supine position alone is therefore not recommended for the early detection of pneumonia in these patients [5]. Also, if an infiltrate is apparent at CXR, the options for its characterization are very limited. If pneumonia is considered in these hosts, thin-section CT should be preferred at any time [18].",

            "text": "Terms like incremental CT, high-resolution CT (HRCT), spiral CT, thin-section CT, multislice CT (MSCT), and low-dose CT are widely used and might confuse non-radiologists. To keep it simple, HRCT is an incremental scanning technique with several respiratory breath-holds resulting in inaccuracy of repositioning of the anatomical lung position. The use of 1 mm sections and gaps in between (e.g., 10 mm) results in representative, detailed images of selected lung areas; however, the noncontiguous scanning has its limitations in nodule detection, quantification, and monitoring. Volumetric techniques as used in spiral CT and MSCT, acquired without gaps, are frequently reconstructed with larger thickness (e.g., 5 mm) resulting in spatial volume effects. This results in limitations to detect inflammatory lung disease, especially ground-glass opacification [22]. Since no additional information is expected from supplemental spiral CT to HRCT, as shown in AIDS patients [23], HRCT may be used as a diagnostic standard. In contrast, thin-section MSCT provides volumetric scanning as well as detailed images [24, 25]. This technique also allows for an adequate monitoring of lung disease since the same anatomical position can be reidentified in baseline and follow-up studies [24\u201326]. While a rapid technical development in CT imaging is ongoing, the different techniques applied today are addressed as \u201cCT\u201d in this chapter.",

In only 10 % of patients with a normal chest x-ray and a normal HRCT, pneumonia occurred during follow-up [21]. Exclusion of pneumonia is another clinically relevant information. Thus, CT yields very useful results with good sensitivity (87 %) and negative predictive value (88 %). The early use of HRCT achieves a gain of approximately 5 days during which pneumonia may be excluded [17]. In clinical practice, this may be very helpful for the management of immunocompromised hosts at high risk of life-threatening pulmonary infection [5] (Fig. 7.2).\n\n",

Comparing CT to MRI on an intraindividual basis, MRI reveals comparable clinical results (sensitivity 95 %, specificity 88 %, positive predictive value 95 %, negative predictive value 88 %) [53]. Besides the lack of radiation, there is no clear advantage of MRI in the early detection of pneumonia (Fig. 7.3). In advanced stages, CT and MRI are comparable in the visualization of infiltrates [30]. CT is widely available, easier, and faster to perform as well as less susceptible to breathing artifacts. MRI is superior to CT in the detection of abscesses due to a clearer detection of central necrosis in T2-weighted images and rim enhancement after contrast application in T1-weighted images [29]. However, this fact has limited clinical impact and duration of MRI, and required compliance is substantially higher compared to CT. MR has problems to detect small lesions and those which are adjacent to the left ventricle due to the cardiac motion [53].\n\n",

They frequently found a \u201chalo sign\u201d (Fig. 7.5) on the first CT scans and reported a low sensitivity of this pattern (68 %), which was no longer visible on follow-up scans. In contrast, the more specific \u201cair-crescent sign\u201d (Fig. 7.7) emerged frequently during follow-up (up to 63 %). The size of infiltrates increased by fourfold under successful antifungal treatment due to hematopoietic reconstitution. In this study, pneumonia was first detected on day 19 of neutropenia. Enlargement of infiltrates is probably caused by the invasion of newly generated neutrophil granulocytes at the beginning of bone marrow recovery. In critically ill patients, leukocyte invasion has been described as a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [14] (Fig. 7.6 and 7.7).\n\n\n\n",

The halo sign, first described in 1984 [49, 50], is nonspecific [33] and not a necessary part of the updated definitions [51]. A nonspecific infiltrate, rated as a minor criterion in the first version [10], was abandoned in the update [51]. In a later workup of a pharmaceutical trial investigating response rates to antifungal treatment, the evidence of the halo sign was associated with an improved response rate (52 % vs. 29 %; p < 0.001), as well as a higher 3-month survival rate (71 % vs. 53 %; p < 0.01) [52]. This large (n = 235) antemortem trial suffers, however, from systemic limitations like investigation of halo which was part of inclusion criteria and technical insufficiencies like usage of thick-section CT instead of appropriate thin-section CT and evaluation of hardcopies instead of monitor reading [52]. Histopathological workup of lung biopsies verified fungal pneumonia in 56 % of cases in another study [37]. Relevant differential diagnoses for the halo sign, such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP, formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, BOOP), pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary manifestation of the underlying malignancy, lung cancer, and non-fungal infections (CMV, tuberculosis, abscesses (Fig. 7.7), etc.) or Candida (Fig. 7.8), have to be considered [37].",
