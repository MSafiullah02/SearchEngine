All government primary care clinics are provided with kits to detect microalbuminuria.

Diabetic patients have their renal function tested and blood pressure taken at regular intervals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are made available in the most rural clinic, and patients that are ACEI intolerant are prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after a review by the internal medicine specialist. HbA1c test is now available in the smaller rural clinics. Most classes of antihypertensives are available in these clinics, as are the commonly used sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin.",

Instead of continuing with increasing numbers of hemodialysis units and patients exponentially, a better way is to combat the disease at an earlier stage. Screening and detection of diabetic nephropathy is being done in primary care settings. Raising awareness of doctors and patients about the threat of renal failure is ongoing. Population-based screening has not been done on a coordinated scale. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the community is unknown. This may be incorporated as an objective of the third National Health and Morbidity survey that is due in 2006. The ultimate aim is to prevent illness, or else to prevent the complications of illness. When will society reap the benefits of prevention strategies and how it will be measured is still unknown. There are few data on the value of screening for early renal disease and how to focus this in order to ensure an optimum cost-benefit ratio.",
