            "text": "The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea in April 2015 led to 186 infections and 37 deaths by the end of October 2015. MERS-CoV was isolated from the imported patient in China. The envelope (E) protein, a small structural protein of MERS-CoV, plays an important role in host recognition and infection. To identify the conserved epitopes of the E protein, sequence analysis was performed by comparing the E proteins from 42 MERS-CoV strains that triggered severe pandemics and infected humans in the past. To predict the potential B cell epitopes of E protein, three most effective online epitope prediction programs, the ABCpred, Bepipred, and Protean programs from the LaserGene software were used. All the nucleotides and amino acids sequences were obtained from the NCBI Database. One potential epitope with a suitable length (amino acids 58-82) was confirmed and predicted to be highly antigenic. This epitope had scores of >0.80 in ABCpred and level 0.35 in Bepipred programs. Due to the lack of X-ray crystal structure of the E protein in the PDB database, the simulated 3D structure of the E protein were also predicted using PHYRE 2 and Pymol programs. In conclusion, using bioinformatics methods, we analyzed the genome sequence of MERS-CoV and identified a potential B-cell epitope of the E protein, which might significantly improve our current MERS vaccine development strategies.",

Coronavirus is a canonical and ancient virus system that can be divided into four categories based on their genome sequence: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus coronavirus. Since it was discovered coronavirus was considered to be relatively harmless to humans until the outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2003 and 2012, respectively. MERS-CoV is a new type of coronavirus identified after the discovery of SARS-CoV, belongs to the Beta coronavirus lineage C [2] , which causes severe acute respiratory disease with a high fatality rate. Moreover, the virus rapidly spread from the Middle East to many other countries including South Korea in 2015, demonstrating a global epidemic trend. However, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine has been developed to treat MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The secondary structure and linear B-cell epitopes of the E protein were predicted by ABCpred, Bepipred, and Protean programs in LaserGene software. Selected sequences were downloaded from NCBI database and analyzed by each program. ABCpred uses a recurrent method which is based on a neural network algorithm [8] (http://www.imtech.res.in/ raghava/abcpred/ABC_submission.html). The lengths of amino acids were set to 12-mer, 14-mer, 16-mer, 18-mer, and 20-mer and the scoring threshold was set to 0.8. Since there is no evidence showing that 20 amino acids is the optimal length for B-cell epitopes, a length of 15-20 amino acids is generally considered. Optimal length is determined by the overall score, higher score indicates a better chance that a sequence is an antigen epitope. Bepipred was developed by Larsen et al. [9] (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ BepiPred/) and it implements a hidden Markov model and a propensity scale method as described by Parker et al. [10] . A threshold of 0.350 was used. For this threshold the sensitivity is 0.49 and the specificity is 0.75. The Protean program in LaserGene software uses the Garnjer-Robson, Chou-Fasman and Karplus-Schulz methods to predict the protein's secondary structure. The parameters of each residue were determined by Pa, Pb, PT, and PC values [11] . According to the Kyte-Doolittle standard for hydrophilic amino acids, potential B cell linear epitopes were usually the hydrophilic regions on the protein surface (as described by Emini). Karplus-Schulz method was used to identify the flexible regions of the E protein. Jameson-Wolf method was used to predict the antigenic index. The significance of the parameters has been described previously [12] , [13] , [14] . All the resulting sequences were collected and aligned using Clustal W multiple sequence alignment programs. Overlapped regions were considered as the potential epitopes.",

All the final 3D structures were generated as ball-and-stick models with distinct colors using PyMOL as previously described [17] . (Table 1) . Whole genome sequences among those host specific coronaviruses shared less than 30 percent similarities. In contrast, further sequence alignment analysis showed that the E protein sequences were nearly identical among the 42 MERS-CoV strains except one single point mutation from isoleucine to valine at amino acid position 9 (I9V) (Fig. 1) . Moreover, since isoleucine and valine residues both are hydrophobic, the I9V point mutation may not alter the antigenic behavior of the E protein.

Higher scores reflected a higher probability of being identified as a B-cell epitope. Eight linear B-cell epitopes in the MERS-CoV E protein showed scores above the threshold value of 0.8. Scores beyond 0.8 mean to be positive, as shown in Table 2 . Meanwhile, one epitope peptide was identified by Bepipred 1.0 server, as shown in Table 3 . We used 0.35 as the threshold. Scores beyond 0.35 account for potential epitote, and a higher score indicates a higer probability of the existing epitope. Although the resulting epitope peptides from ABCpred and Bepipred were not totally identical, the overlapping regions were considered as the B-cell line epitope areas. As shown in Table 3 , epitopes 2, 5, and 7 were identified as the potential B-Cell line epitopes. Structural analysis following the Kyte-Doolittle standard suggests that a large hydrophilic area was presented in the amino acids (aa) 58-82 region at the C-terminal of E protein.",

Dozens of B cell antigen epitopes have been discovered following various algorithms, offering us multiple reliable means of predicting the antigen's hydrophilic regions, accessibility, flexibility and antigenic solubility [19] . The ABCpred algorithm, which was used to predict the linear B-cell epitopes of MERS-CoV E protein in our study, has been previously shown to successfully predict epitopes with 65.93 percent accuracy (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/) [20] . Thus bioinformatics studies could provide reliable guidance in selecting specific immunogenic epitopes, which will be significant for vaccine design, epitope mapping and antibody studies. Further combination of various bioinformatics prediction methods could significantly increase the prediction accuracy. Recent outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea was the largest one outside of Saudi Arabia in the world [21] . Because the mortality rate of the MERS-CoV is as high as 40 percent, it is considered as one of the most critical emerging pathogens threatening human health. Previous study showed that a recombinant SL-CoV containing a very small fragment of the SARS-CoV S gene was able to infect and cause disease in mice, highlighting its potential for pathogenicity in humans [22] . However, characterization of the immunogenic determinants for the MERS-CoV protein remains unresolved. Here in our study we found that the gene sequences of MERS-CoV were moderately conserved among different coronavirus strains although Cotten et al. studied MERS-CoV gene diversity and found numerous variations among different strains [23] . Nevertheless, at least two distinct lineages, including circulating and transmission patterns in the epidemic, are consistent in both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events. The E protein, which is essential for virus packaging, is a moderately expressed small transmembrane protein and presented on the surface of virus envelope as well as the infected cells. Our further comparison studies showed that the E protein is highly conserved among different virus strains isolated from different species (e.g., Camelus dromedarius, Vespertilio superans and Homo sapiens) at different times and locations near the endemic areas [24] . Since sequence alignment revealed that the E protein from the 42 strains were nearly identical except a point mutation from isoleucine to valine. And Durai P [25] had stated that MERS-CoV E protein has striking similarities to SARS-CoV E protein, which has a resolved NMR structure. Therefore E protein was chosen as a potential antigenic target for the humoral immune responses, which might be significant for developing better diagnostic and research reagents in the future.",

Based on our results, aa 58-82 was identified as a potential antigen epitope region. Further online prediction and sequence comparison analysis revealed that this region was highly antigenicity and low variation region, supporting our prediction of AA 58-82 as an antigen epitope region. Since E protein structure is not available in the PDB molecular database, we used the PHYRE 2 server and PyMOL software to predict the 3D structure of E protein. The predicted structure was consistent with previous secondary structure prediction. AA 58-82 of the E protein was predicted to be a good candidate as the B cell epitope peptide area. Overall, using bioinformatics methods, we have successfully identified a potential B cell line epitope of MERS-CoV E protein, while experimental and clinical evidence are necessary to validate our studies. Future studies could also relate to other proteins in MERS-CoV and other coronavirus strains. Since currently there is no effective treatment or preventive vaccine available targeting MERS-CoV, the fusion B-cell epitopes of the E protein identified in this study might be the potential targets to design effective MERS-CoV vaccines and facilitate the development of rapid diagnostic methods in the future.",
