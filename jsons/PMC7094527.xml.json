Deep nasal swabs were obtained as an alternative in situation where an isolation facility was unavailable.19 These specimens were put immediately in viral transport medium and kept at 4\u00b0C during transportation. Both viral RNA and DNA were extracted on the same day of collection by PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). RNA extracted was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen). All DNA and cDNA were used immediately for nested multiplex PCR for 20 respiratory pathogens as described previously.20\nTables 1a and 1b in the online supplement summarize sequences and amplicon sizes of the outer and inner sets of PCR primers. Briefly, each nested multiplex PCR assay detected four pathogens. Group 1 comprised influenza A and B group-specific and subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H5N1-specific primers; group 2 comprised parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4a, and PIV-4b); group 3 comprised RSV A and B, HRV, and enterovirus; group 4 comprised HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HMPV; and group 5 comprised M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, HBoV, and adenovirus. Both the first and second rounds of PCR were conducted in 20-\u03bcl reaction mixtures using fast thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Two microliters of cDNA was used as the template for the first round of PCR for groups 1 to 4, whereas 8 \u03bcL of the extracted preparation was used for group 5. In the second round of PCR, a 0.2-\u03bcL aliquot of the first-round PCR product was used as a template. Table 1c in the online supplement summarizes the PCR conditions of five multiplex nested PCR assays. The PCR products were stained by SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) and visualized by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. Four corresponding positive controls and one negative control (sterile water) sample were included for each group simultaneously. In order to prevent PCR contamination, reagent preparation, sample processing, and nested PCR assays were performed in separate rooms away from where amplified products were analyzed. Aerosol-resistant pipette tips were used throughout the experiments.",

Our assays detected \u2264 10 nucleic acid copies for all viruses (except enteroviruses), which were comparable to those reported in widely quoted high-throughput multiplex PCR assays.21 Specifically, our nested PCR was able to detect one cDNA copy of HRV. The present study used the same method, except for Legionella pneumophila being replaced by HBoV, to investigate the infective causes of asthma exacerbation in Hong Kong children. HRV infections also peaked in winter of 2007/2008 in children with asthma exacerbation (Fig 1). Our detection rate (51%) was similar to previous local studies20, 22 but lower than those published in white populations.23 It is uncertain whether our low HRV detection rate was due to limitations of the PCR technique, which is less likely in view of our previously noted in vitro results, or a genuinely low incidence of HRV infection in Hong Kong children.

            "text": "HRV infection was associated with asthma exacerbation in the children, which is consistent with published data about the importance of HRV in white populations. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma birth cohort, a total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age.24 HRV-associated wheezing in years 1 and 3 were the strongest predictor for asthma diagnosis at the age of 6 years. Nearly 90% of children who wheezed with HRV in year 3 subsequently developed asthma. Two other studies found HRV to be the most important microbiological risk factors for asthma diagnosis and disease exacerbation.25, 26, 27 More recently, Miller et al28 reported that childhood asthma exacerbations were associated with the novel group C of HRV rather than the two previously known phylogenetic groups A and B. On the other hand, HRV infection was detected in 13% of our subjects with stable asthma who did not experience any symptom or sign of disease exacerbation. In a longitudinal study of healthy children, 20.6% of all HRV infections were asymptomatic.29 Future studies should delineate the pathogenic linkage between HRV and worsened asthma.",

Infected respiratory epithelial cells, and possibly macrophages, produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukotrienes. These mediators in turn attract different inflammatory cells to the airway, resulting in worsened immunopathology and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness observed in patients with asthma. In addition, airway epithelium from patients with asthma is deficient in mounting adequate antiviral responses to HRV.31, 32\n",

            "text": "The major limitation of this project relates to its study power. The number of controls was much lower than that of our recruited cases, mainly because case-control matching within 1 week was not possible on many occasions when stable and especially younger patients also complained of nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, blocked nose, sore throat) during change of weather. Our sample size had a power of 97% for detecting any difference in the detection of any virus between cases and controls, but had a marginal power of 70% for HRV infection (GraphPad StatMate; San Diego, CA) and < 50% for the detection of other respiratory pathogens because of their rarity. Thus, larger studies are needed to delineate the possible association between asthma exacerbation and RTIs by these organisms. The lack of standardization on the methodology of HRV detection would also pose a problem. A recent study revealed that HRVs consist of > 100 distinct serotypes.35 In view of this degree of phylogenetic heterogeneity, the PCR primers designed for our multiplex assays were not able to detect all HRVs. Despite the use of sensitive multiplex assays as discussed previously, our molecular approach for detecting viruses would miss some HRVs that were not covered by our PCR primers. Future studies need to adopt multiple PCR primers that specifically target as many HRV serotypes as possible. Another weakness is that NPA samples were collected from 236 (83.4%) subjects, whereas nasal swabs were collected from the remaining subjects. As we previously reported, the overall sensitivity of detecting influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and adenovirus in NPA was higher than that obtained by nasal swabs in local children.36 On the other hand, we did not have relevant data for HRV. Although more than 80% of subjects had NPA samples, it is possible that we might have missed some organisms in those with only nasal swabs. We also observed that only 30% of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation had successfully performed FeNO measurement according to guideline (Table 1).18 As patients with severe bronchospasm were probably too breathless for the procedure, only patients with milder attacks would contribute to FeNO readings in this group. In addition, a substantial proportion of these patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids prior to FeNO. These reasons explain the lower FeNO in these patients when compared with patients with stable asthma.",
