However, there are several indications that, this time, worldwide economic expansion is anchored on much firmer foundations. The end of the war in Iraq has reduced world political uncertainties. The adjustment processes undertaken in companies and banks in getting to grips with the dismissals that had occurred as a result of the strong expansion in the second half of the 1990s have made vast progress. Measures implemented to reduce costs are showing signs of success, and profits have been rising noticeably for some time. Opportunities for companies to borrow have improved as a result of the improved profits achieved on stock markets. Since economic policy has, simultaneously, maintained its expansionary course, the conditions for lasting world economic revival are favourable.",

Once again, the United States is the frontrunner; its highly expansionary macro policy has led to a very strong increase in domestic demand. Meanwhile, Japan's cyclical recovery has proven to be surprisingly strong _ a remarkable feat, given the country's on-going deflation. The Japanese economy seems to be veering onto a path of greater growth, especially since increases in production have not been due to increased government spending, as in previous years. Company restructuring has evidently advanced to such an extent that the central bank's zero-interest rate policy and the strong increase in its money supply are showing increasing effectiveness. In cyclical terms, the euro zone is the 'straggler', since its economic activity has been stagnant since autumn of last year. The noticeable real effective euro revaluation had a dampening effect, and the economic policy impulses were comparatively weak.",

In Japan, continued economic expansion is anticipated.

The euro zone will experience a growing revival in demand and production. However, even in the second half of next year, the production gap will be reduced only slightly.

A more pessimistic risk assessment on the part of foreign investors would imply that the influx of capital could be maintained only through increased interest rates.

This implies a fairly substantial risk that markets will force a reduction in the current account deficit in the short or long term. One possibility of reducing this gap between imports and exports would be a strong devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Although the dollar has lost in value over the past 18 months, the effect on the current account deficit has been negligible. To achieve a positive effect, a further significant devaluation would be required, which could happen abruptly. The risk that such a development might occur has risen in recent months, as evidenced by shifts in the structure of capital imports: short-term investments have grown considerably, at the expense of longer term investments, and especially direct investments.",

Consequently, however, financing the U.S. current account deficit depends heavily on intervention policies of the Japanese and Chinese governments. For both countries, there is the paramount concern at the loss of competitiveness of domestic goods, but also that of possible pressure on the highly fragile financial markets there. A large-scale liberalisation of exchange rates by the Far Eastern central banks is therefore highly unlikely during the forecast period. The risk of a further loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar with continued intervention in favour of the yen and yuan will continue. In this case, the scenario would be similar to that of the previous 18 months: the euro zone in particular, one of the economically weakest of the important economic regions, would have to bear the burden of a strong revaluation thrust. Given the different economic policy intentions of the individual countries, there is the potential for considerable turbulence on currency markets. In addition, a trend towards a protectionist trade policy could increase in the United States. All of this would impair world economic recovery.",

Until the summer, consumption also benefited from low mortgage interest rates, which many households utilised to refinance their debts.

Moreover, as a result of the slower increase in real estate prices and the anticipated further rise in mortgage interest rates, the tendency among pri-vate households to save is likely to be slightly greater. Against this background, it is vital _ for the further direction of the economy _ that the recovery spreads to the labour market. There are doubts currently as to whether the economic acceleration will soon lead to a visible expansion in employment. These doubts are based on employment figures obtained from company surveys that, until recently, showed a strong fall in employment. On the other hand, however, employment figures obtained from surveys of domestic households showed an upward trend since early 2002 (cf. figure 1 ). The discrepancy between the two is probably largely due to data collection problems. Thus, the growing trend towards outsourcing has evidently meant that employees are left out of company statistics, since parts of companies located elsewhere are not included in the survey samples. This would therefore support the argument that, currently, domestic surveys provide a more accurate description of employment trends. Thus, the labour market situation seems more favourable than is frequently assumed.",

Monetary policy remains firmly on an expansionary path. The Bank of Japan has maintained not only its zero-interest policy and further massively increased liquidity on money markets; it has also lowered capital market interest rates through increased purchases of government bonds; it has encouraged a noticeable recovery in share prices by purchasing blocks of shares from bank securities; and it has recently even begun to buy up debts of companies outside the banking sector.

In addition, unit labour costs will rise only slightly, given the moderate wage increases and a cyclically dependent rising labour productivity. The situation on the labour market will not improve until towards the end of the forecast period. Against this background, therefore, private households are likely to expand their consumer spending only slowly. On the whole, GDP will increase by 0.4% in 2003 and by 1.7% in 2004 (cf. table 4). The after-effects of the euro revaluation will initially dampen the buoyancy of prices. In addition, given continuously low capacity utilisation, opportunities for companies to increase prices remain limited. In general, the inflation rate is likely to reach 2.0% this year and to fall to 1.7% next year. ",

The closer the links, the greater, tendentially, will be the anticipated growth in income. On balance, therefore, countries that have only loose economic links with the accession states will have to face losses and will also have to be prepared for considerable cuts in the amount of EU structural funding allocated to them. 5 The growth effects resulting from the per capita income are likely to be much greater for the accession states than for the EU-15. For Poland and Hungary, for example, they are estimated to constitute between 8% and 9%, and for the CEECs in total 5% to 8%. 6 The effects are, for one thing, more significant, because the mobilisation of productivity reserves, linked with a more efficient distribution of labour and capital accumulation, will be greater than in EU-15, given the lower levels of income. Moreover, compared with the current EU members, the accession countries are small.

Only in Slovenia and Cyprus has per capita GDP measured in this way exceeded per capita income levels of Portugal and Greece, the poorest EU-15 member states. Nevertheless, the increase of real GDP in the accession states, averaging 3.9% annually between 1995 and 2002, has been significantly higher than the EU-15 average of 2.1%. With regard to economic structure, there are differences between the regions. At 63%, the share of gross value added achieved in the accession states' services sectors was slightly lower than the EU-15 average, while the share of the industry and construc-tion sectors, at 26% and 7% respectively, was slightly higher than in the EU; here, corresponding shares were 71%, 22% and 5%, respectively. At 4%, the share of agriculture in gross value added in the accession states is higher than the EU average of 2%. The proportion of both exports and imports is significantly higher in the accession states than in EU-15. The structural change that is occurring as a result of the transformation process has left deep traces in the central and eastern European countries' labour markets. At 14.4%, the 2002 unemployment rate in the accession states as a whole was almost twice as high as that in EU-15 (7.6%).

The investment required to improve transport infrastructure as well as for environmental protection are estimated at an annual 4% of GDP over the next 15 years. 8 Migration of large numbers of workers has not been observed, primarily due to the restricted freedom of movement. Given the considerable differences in income between the accession countries and the current EU member states _ which are substantially greater than in the case of the Mediterranean enlargement _ a stronger influx of labour is anticipated after accession. 9 Given the long transition periods in terms of removing barriers to the existing mobility, however, large-scale effects are not likely in the short term. In the long term, such migration could lead to an increase in jobs especially in Germany and Austria.

If the approximation of price levels were to occur by means of higher inflation rates, nominal and real convergence would be in conflict with each other. The accession countries do, indeed, demonstrate lower price levels than the EU-15 (cf. figure 7 ). In addition, all (except Malta) demonstrate a real revaluation of their currencies against the euro. To explain real revaluation in the catching-up process, the Balassa-Samuelson Effect in particular is often applied. 14 Currently, however, this effect is not quantitatively significant in the accession states, in particular because the weighting of market services is comparatively low in the consumer price index. 15 The higher inflation rate results primarily from the increase of administered prices, which will in future be lower. 16 In addition, prices of industrial goods (i.e. tradable goods) are rising more quickly than in the EU. This is due in large part to the fact that the quality of these goods is dramatically on the increase in the accession states. In this case, a higher price does not imply a loss of purchasing power, and the real revaluation caused by this does not lead to a loss in international competitiveness. 13 After EU enlargement, the new member states will therefore also be included in the formulation of the reference value. 14 According to this, in countries involved in a real convergence process, there is an upward pressure on the price level, which originally emanates from productivity increases in tradable goods (i.e. especially industrial goods) and which initially shows up in a higher wage level in this sector. This has secondary effects on wage levels in the sector of non-tradable goods (especially services); with lower productivity growth there, prices of non-tradable goods rise. This mechanism implies a real upward valuation of currencies, which, with a fixed exchange rate, occurs via higher inflation rates. With a flexible exchange rate, this can also occur via a nominal upward valuation. Economics, vol. 31, 2003, p. 552-572. 16 The currently high rate of inflation in Slovakia can be explained primarily with reference to this effect. The inflationary dynamism still appears to be a problem in Hungary and Slovenia, where the central banks' weak reputation is keeping inflation expectations high and where indexation mechanisms are contributing to stubborn wage inflation. In this case, a re-orientation of monetary and wage policy is needed.",

The gross rate of debt may not constitute more than 60%, and new public budget debt not more than 3%, in relation to GDP. The criterion concerning the gross debt level was met by all accession states (with the exception of Malta) in 2002. The situation is different in terms of the deficit. With the exception of the Baltic States and Slovenia, all of the remaining countries exceeded the upper limit last year (cf. table 7). Especially in the largest accession states, i.e. Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, net newly incurred debt has in fact increased. This is partly due to a dropping off of the economy, but also partly owing to expansionary financial policy.",

Although the Pre-Accession Economic Programmes do provide for a substantial reduction of the budget deficits, so that, according to the planning phase, by 2005 only the Czech Republic wil be considerably off the mark where the deficit criterion is concerned. However, the underlying growth assumptions for many of the countries are optimistic; for the most part, they are considerably higher than the Institutes' forecasts and those of the OECD and the European Commission. In addition, in some countries, achieving the goal of consolidation through tax reforms could become more difficult, since the resulting effect would, at least in the short term, increase the deficit. EU accession will also _ as has already been described _ undoubtedly place a burden on public budgets. In some countries, a lack of budgetary discipline is currently a major obstacle to the speedy introduction of the euro. But here, too, experience prior to the beginning of Stage Three of EMU shows that, given a specific date, considerable progress in terms of budget consolidation is possible in a short time. In addition, the public budgets are being relieved by interest rate trends, and the accession states are likely to benefit considerably from EU membership over the longer term.",
