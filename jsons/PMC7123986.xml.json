These ORFs encode various viral proteins, which take part in different virus infection steps (Narayanan et al. 2007). These viral proteins can be classified into three groups: structural proteins, nonstructural proteins and accessory proteins. Generally, researchers take Spike protein, Membrane protein, Envelope protein, and Nucleocapsid protein as the four major structure proteins, since they are all located on the mature virus particles and construct the virus framework. Nonstructural proteins generally refer to viral enzymes, for example the virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase and other viral proteinases. Besides these structural proteins and nonstructural proteins, there are many other viral proteins encoded by many other ORFs. The existence and functions of these proteins are all still debatable.",

Protein sequence analysis on ORF3a suggests that it is a membrane protein which has three transmembrane domains at the N terminus. Upon analysis of the full-length sequence of ORF3a, we found that it lacks similarities to any known proteins. However, some researchers divided the protein sequence into several parts and then BLAST-searched them separately. Results clearly showed that the N-terminal domain of ORF3a had 29% identity with the putative cytochrome B-561 transmembrane protein from a bacterium (Ralstonia solanacearum) and 24% identity with the opsin fragments from a hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) and the rhodopsin from a butterfly (Popilio glaucus). The C terminus of ORF3a had moderate similarity to the calcium-transporting ATPase (calcium pump) from a parasite (Plasmodium falciparum; 41% identity) and the outer-membrane porin from a bacterium (Shewanella oneidensis; 27% identity) (Yu et al. 2004).",

Thus it is postulated that ORF3a can promote S protein function, and then facilitate virus entry. But little further study has focused on this possibility. One research group proposed that the N-terminal ectodomain of ORF3a can elicit a strong humoral response, which may provide a protective humoral response in SARS patients (Akerstr\u00f6m et al. 2006). However, another group tested the neutralization ability of the anti-ORF3a antibody (Qiu et al. 2005), and the results suggested that anti-ORF3a antibody did not show neutralization ability compared with some anti-S antibodies that were tested. We therefore cannot say definitely that ORF3a is a participant in SARS-CoV entry, and many critical experiments still need to be done to answer this question.",

Initially we obtained cDNA from selected samples, transcribed them in vitro into complementary mRNA, and then microinjected these mRNAs into oocyte cells, which are nearly one millimeter in diameter and easily used in microinjection. Several days later, using a TEVC amplifier on these injected oocytes, we analyzed their membrane potential and conductance to test their channel activity. When using ORF3a in this TEVC test, we found a dramatic membrane current through ORF3a-expressing oocytes compared with control oocytes. This result clearly indicated that ORF3a may form an ion channel. We also found this current to be partially inhibited by barium, which is also a specific potassium channel inhibitor. We also tested the channel permeability of ORF3a to potassium ions and found that potassium ions can pass through its channel pore.",

We proposed that the SARS-CoV ORF3a channel is closely related to virus release. It is interesting to note that some other viral ion channels are also thought to be associated with virus release: for example, HIV encoded ion channel Vpu protein can promote the release of HIV virus particles specifically in human cell lines. p7 protein from HCV has also been proved to form a ion channel, and its absence will cause reduction of HCV virus assembly and release.

We found that the latter pathway was responsible for SNE-mediated intracellular increase. When we blocked this calcium influx through l-type calcium channels with the specific inhibitor nimodipine, we found that the virus assembly inside the virus-infected cells was arrested. Virus budding seemed to be inhibited in the absence of calcium influx, and consequently virus release was also interrupted.",

            "text": "It has already been reported that coronavirus assembly begins with the viral genome RNAs interacting with nucleoproteins to form ribonucleoproteins in the host-cell cytoplasm. These ribonucleoproteins move to the budding sites at the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi region (Garoff et al. 1998; Kuo and Masters 2002; Stertz et al. 2007). From the Golgi compartments, infected cells synthesize many vesicles, called multivesicular bodies (MVB). Virus core particles can bud into these vesicles and cause the phospholipid bilayer to form mature virions. Vesicles containing a large amount of mature viruses will then be transported to the cell membrane, where viruses are released after fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane (Weiss and Navas-Martin 2005a; Qinfen et al. 2004). One or more steps of coronavirus assembly may be influenced by calcium influx through l-type calcium channels. We thus propose that one possibility is that the formation of MVBs is calcium-dependent during coronavirus infection. Calcium influx can lead to an increase in the number or size of MVBs, and subsequently promote efficient virus assembly and release. Viral SNE proteins simply trigger this calcium requirement via activation of l-type calcium channels.",
