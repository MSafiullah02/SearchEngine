However, most of these estimates fail to account for the large numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases, nor for the public health response to recognized clusters, both of which resulted in reduced transmission of MERS-CoV during the Spring 2014 outbreak. In this sense, the models published thus far describe effective, rather than basic, reproductive numbers. This distinction is important, as it is the basic reproduction number that determines epidemic potential 5. Furthermore, the character of outbreaks in healthcare settings suggests that while the overall reproduction number for this pathogen may be low, there is heterogeneity in transmission based on setting, and reproduction numbers in the healthcare context are likely to be higher than those seen in the community and household settings 5 .",

Case history gaps, lags in reporting, and sudden \u201cdumps\u201d of novel data have contributed to considerable uncertainty about key epidemiological properties of this disease. Because of the status of most-impacted countries as global hubs for business, tourism, and religious pilgrimage, and the prior occurrence of disease importation into countries lacking putative MERS-CoV reservoirs, better understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology and epidemic dynamics is a global need.

While the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection in humans has now apparently been occurring for over two years, high-quality epidemiological analyses from countries with the greatest burden of MERS-CoV cases are still in short supply. Although local acquisition of MERS-CoV has occurred overwhelmingly on the Arabian Peninsula, this disease is a global public health concern and it is important for clinicians and public health practitioners both inside and outside the most-impacted regions to have sufficient information for formulation of good preventive practices.",

These parameters define both the gravity of a disease, as well as its potential for ongoing transmission. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given our investigation in the context of an outbreak, we found estimates of R0 that are higher than those previously reported in the literature, which themselves were based on sporadic case occurrence and self-limited clusters 4\n,\n6\n,\n7 . Furthermore, most of the estimates we derived were in the 2-3 range, similar to that estimated for SARS-CoV in the context of hospital outbreaks 16\n,\n17 . Estimates for Jeddah were even higher, though this elevated R0 was accompanied by a high d, suggesting an explosive outbreak which was brought under control relatively rapidly. Taken together, these observations suggest that the healthcare environment represents fertile soil for the transmission of MERS-CoV, as it did for SARS-CoV, and that measures instituted in response to SARS (including strengthening hospital infection control programs) would also be effective against MERS.",

The dark blue curve is generated using an IDEA model fit to the entire time series. The red and green curves represent IDEA models fit using only 4 or 6 outbreak generations, prior to or at the outbreak peak, respectively. The black curve is generated by fitting the model to 9 generations of data, encompassing the outbreak peak and initial decline. The post-peak curve and full time series curve are almost identical, but the full contour of the outbreak is difficult to project based on earlier data.",
