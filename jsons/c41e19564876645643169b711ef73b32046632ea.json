This has lead to a collapse of substantial parts of the economy. Carriers of the disease are infectious roughly 3 days after exposure to the virus. First symptoms occur later or not at all. As a consequence tracing the contacts of people identified as carriers is essential for controlling the pandemic. This tracing must work everywhere, in particular indoors, where people are closest to each other. Furthermore, it should respect people's privacy. The present paper presents a method to enable a thorough traceability with very little risk on privacy. In our opinion, the latter capabilities are necessary to control the pandemic during a future relaunch of our economy.",

Any value above 1 leads to a exponential growth, as long as there is no substantial immunity. More detailed epidemiological models are more differentiated but show a similar threshold behavior [1] . The value of R 0 , mentioned above is determined by the period during which a carrier is contagious, the probability of transmitting the disease, and the number of contacts that the carrier had during that time. There is no means to control the first factor. The second may be somewhat influenced by carrying masks but not to a level considered sufficient.

The development of vaccines and of medications are essential but may not be available in the near future. This has led to an enforced reduction of contacts by various levels of quarantine. The concept of achieving immunity by letting the epidemic spread have rightfully been abandoned, due to the heavy toll in human lives. Bill Gates formulates what most of us think \"But bringing the economy back ... that's more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life. So we're going to take the pain in the economic dimension -huge pain -in order to minimize the pain in the diseases-and-death dimension.\" 1 The \"how\" of restarting the economy remains. Some authors studied the effect of relaxing the quarantine at the cost of a regrowth of infected people before shutting down again [2] . This leads to an increasing level of immunity in a series of waves. In view of the small percentage of people that are immunized at each step and in view of the risk of an unmanageable growth, the number of waves needs to be substantial. Furthermore, each wave costs lives. China, South Korea and to a much smaller scale Webasto in Germany have shown an alternative, which consists in a careful tracing of contacts, associated with testing, and quarantining positively tested people. We will call these people \"carriers\" throughout the paper.",

            "text": "Tracing contacts is a rather natural concept for containing the pandemic. It aims at identifying and subsequently isolating people, who might potentially be carriers. Since the incubation time until an infected person becomes infectious herself is around 3 days and since first symptoms only occur after 5 days at the earliest, with a diagnosis available at en even later time, there is a lag during which infectious carriers continue spreading the disease. Thus, knowing contacts to people who have been identified as carriers, allows isolating unidentified potential carriers. The frequent absence of clear symptoms is a second critical cause for the spreading of the infection. In this case contact tracing allows identifying carriers without symptoms through their contact to people with symptoms. In that case, the carrier with symptoms is not the originator but rather helps discovering the originator. Independent on who is the originator, contact tracing and subsequent isolation eliminates sources of disease spreading. An immediate testing and determination of contacts allows to identify further contact whenever the outcome of the test was positive. In the case of a negative outcome, testing is repeated after an incubation time, with isolation being lifted in the case of a second negative outcome.",

Due to the exponential character of the network of relations, there are simply too many contacts to be traced. We ended up isolating everyone first at the Institute level, shortly after that and independently of us at DLR level and finally at national level. This observed complexity led us to the conclusion that automatic means of tracing are essential. Raskar et al. [3] have analyzed an approach based on locating people with a particular focus on privacy-protection and self-protection against the disease. We follow a somewhat different approach. It is primarily based on contacts, rather than on locations, although locations may be used in addition. Furthermore, it is focusing on the control of the pandemic as a whole. The protection of the individual turns out to reach a similar level as in the approach by Raskar et al. [3] .",

The public authorities responsible for health is the \"Gesundheitsamt.\" The Gesundheits\u00e4mter (many of them, distributed all over the country) register every person affected by the pandemic and organize the testing of people. Thus the identity of any person which either has symptoms, is tested positively or is affected by the disease is currently known to the local Gesundheitsamt. We shall subsequently just speak of the Gesundheitsamt as if it was a single entity. That Gesundheitsamt is a trusted authority independent of any use of electronic means to trace contacts. It shall thus also be the trusted authority in our approach, which will be responsible to operate the server needed to manage the list of carriers. They do furthermore manage people in quarantine, who have to follow strict rules in Germany. Not doing so may lead to fines and imprisonment [4] . Additionally, Germany has imposed limitations on the movement of people, which should not be confused with the stricter quarantine. In our view, it should be acceptable that regaining new degrees of freedom may be associated with certain restrictions, which ensure the traceability of contacts, without unduly exposing privacy. Recent polls in Germany show a high level of acceptance of restrictions to combat the pandemic. It may well be acceptable to enforce the use of tracing, although this is not the focus of the paper.",

It should avoid any deficiencies but is still exposed to exploits of the operating systems and the like. We also assume that the public key cryptosystem is secure in the relevant time. The data base of the Gesundheitsamt is only of limited interest, since it contains very little information and since the data is not personalized. The bigger threat is the impersonation of the Gesundheitsamt, it may lead to a number of options, which mostly don't have a clear benefit, like \u2022 The removal or addition of contacts. \u2022 The false categorization of contacts. \u2022 The undue convocation of people to testing. \u2022 The quarantining of healthy people. The most influential possibility is to add a carrier to ga_ctc and to thus retrieve the list of his contacts. This, however, requires finding a valid random daily identifier, e.g. by creating an explicit contact to a person as well as a major software bug at the Gesundheitsamt e.g. by exposing its private key. Other sophisticated attacks are conceivable, e.g. using a network of cooperating Bluetooth units to profile users by tracking their passage near those units. This is not particular to the present system, however. Otherwise, we did not find an obvious other critical attack so far. In the end the usefulness of tracing carriers of COVID-19 and of restoring normality to our daily life have to be balanced against fears of potential attacks.",

This protocol allows devices to broadcast identifiers, which are received by other devices in the neighborhood.

The transmission was, however, discontinued, whenever the app was sent into the background. As a consequence, we implemented an alternative approach using the standard Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. A corresponding app was written for iOS and and another one for Android. Both apps implement the beacon transmission and beacon monitoring. The source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/danielgnt. The subdirectories bletrack-android and bletrack-ios contain the associated code. These apps could successfully monitor beacons between Android phones as well as between iOS and Android phones. All associated trials worked with the apps in the background on both phones. However, we could not get the iOS to iOS scenario working with both apps in the background.

The health agency \"Gesundheitsamt\" is a trusted authority, which only stores contact profiles of positively tested people. This data does not have to include any means of identification of physical person. The next step in bringing this approach to reality would be to setup a task force force designing the details of the protocol, as well as implementing and testing the mobile and server components. The aim should be for a quick and stable initial operational systems. The outcome should be further optimized in a second phase to improve contact classification in order to reduce unnecessary testing and quarantining.",
