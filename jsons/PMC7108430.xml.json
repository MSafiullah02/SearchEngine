Viruses have adapted to the human population over many millennia,1 and many have now evolved to exclusive transmission in humans through the respiratory route, yet the disease they cause is not restricted to the respiratory system. Examples of viruses causing systemic disease transmitted through the respiratory route include measles and erythrovirus B19. Other human viral infections cause respiratory system disease and transmit through respiratory secretions; for example, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses and human adapted strains of influenza A, which cause seasonal epidemics, and influenza B and C, which are human pathogens. The outcome of infection and clinical disease presentation is partly dependent on virus factors, which restrict viral replication to certain cell types (tissue tropism).",

For many of these infections, humans are dead-end hosts. Such infections are usually well recognized, with effective control measures to limit human disease; examples include rabies. However, new infectious agents of man are described at regular intervals. For the last decade at least one significant new human pathogen has been identified almost every year, involving a diversity of organisms. The rate of identification of new viruses has increased in recent years with the application of genomics, which has facilitated the detection of organisms that could not previously be cultivated (Table 1\n).2\n",

Some may be viruses that have been in the human population for decades or even centuries without an animal reservoir, but through the application of improved diagnostic techniques are now recognized, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (Table 2\n). Other newly described infections may have emerged very recently into the human population as a result of a species jump, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Such infections may first come to attention as a result of a severe undiagnosed respiratory illness, or an unusual severe illness requiring critical care, without obvious animal exposures, and may be detected as a result of an astute clinician requesting detailed diagnostic testing to rule out known infections. Evaluating the importance of a newly emerging virus is dependent on understanding the host range, disease and pathogenesis in man, transmissibility and likelihood of sustained transmission in human population.",

Seventeen HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes are found circulating in the wild, giving rise to over 150 different subtype combinations. There is great genetic diversity within influenza viruses in wild bird populations as a result of the ability of viruses to recombine segments. Not all different influenza A subtypes are established in man or mammalian hosts. Only a limited number of subtypes have adapted to circulation in mammalian species, including humans, horses and swine.

Replication in poultry may be associated with disease in poultry of varying severity or may be asymptomatic, depending on the viral subtype and the poultry species.

However, by the late 1990s, different subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2) had emerged and became predominant among North American pig herds. These swine influenza A viruses acquired avian, human and swine virus gene segments through reassortment, and various genetic lineages can be distinguished within each subtype. In Europe, swine influenza is caused primarily by the same subtypes. However, the antigenic and genetic characteristics differ significantly from those found in North America and Asia. Genetic diversity has been expanded through multiple introductions of influenza viruses from other animal hosts into pig herds including from humans, most recently demonstrated with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.2\n",

The basis of vaccination against influenza is the observation that infection with influenza generates neutralizing antibodies to the viral surface proteins, predominantly HA. These antibodies will protect against infection with the same strain of influenza, and may give limited protection against closely related strains. Vaccines used in humans are designed to elicit high levels of antibody to viral HA protein. The more distant an influenza virus, the less protective the antibodies generated by natural immunity or vaccination will be. As human influenza drift variants arise frequently, it is necessary to update vaccines on a regular basis. Influenza vaccines are given annually, before the influenza season, so that those with the highest risk factor may benefit from boosted immunity. In developed countries, there has been an expansion of vaccination policies to ensure that individuals aged over 65 are vaccinated, irrespective of pre-existing illness, and every effort is made to target those with risk factors in younger age groups. Vaccination rates vary considerably between developed countries, and between the developed and the developing world.",

The vaccines undergo limited replication in the nasal cavity and induce both humoral and cellular immunity, which is more broadly protective.

When such drugs are licensed they will enhance the ability to treat infections and avoid the emergence of drug resistance that occurs in the severely immunocompromised host, and with higher frequency in treated children. In immunocompromised individuals, influenza A replicates to high viral load in the absence of immune responses, and infection may become persistent, giving prolonged shedding of unusual drug-resistant variants that are difficult to treat. Intravenous immunoglobulin usually contains high levels of neutralizing antibody to influenza, and may be useful in treating severely immunocompromised individuals who are unable to clear seasonal influenza infections.

Viral factors include the NA subtype of influenza, with N1-containing viruses more likely to sustain the mutations in viral NA to inhibit drug binding (and thereby generate resistance) compared with N2-containing viruses. The most commonly described mutation associated with NA drug resistance is the histidine-to-tyrosine shift (H275Y) seen in H1N1 or H5N1 viruses, which reduces oseltamivir susceptibility by over 600-fold. This is associated with clinical resistance to drug. However, even when resistant virus emerges in an individual during the course of treatment as a species detectable towards the end of a treatment course, it may not have any clinical consequence for the individual in whom resistance is detected if that individual is immunologically normal, or the infection is with seasonal influenza. The ability of drug-resistant influenza to transmit occurred during 2007/2008 with seasonal H1N1, although this virus has now been replaced with pandemic H1N1, which remains sensitive to oseltamivir.11\n",
