With no effective vaccine and no prospect for a cure in the foreseeable future, antiretroviral treatment is the only option at hand to combat HIV infection. Current HIV therapeutics target the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase and protease. The use of a combination of these drugs, termed highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), can efficiently reduce viral load in infected patients. Despite the success of HAART in reducing HIV related morbidity and mortality, HAART cannot eradicate virus in infected patients and might not confer life long suppression of HIV replication. In fact, due to ongoing HIV replication, drug resistant viruses frequently arise in treated patients and such viruses are increasingly transmitted between individuals. These observations, together with the considerable side effects of some HAART regimens, underline that current therapeutics need to be improved and that new antiviral agents with novel modes of action that are effective against current drug resistant viruses need to be sought. The replicative cycle of HIV affords multiple opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Entry of HIV into a cell, integration of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome and the generation of mature infectious progeny virions (\"maturation\") are promising targets for inhibitors. Here, we will discuss how HIV accomplishes entry, integration and maturation and which strategies are being pursued to inhibit these processes.",

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) typically employs a combination of protease and/or RT inhibitors. Modern ART regimens, referred to as \"highly active antiretroviral therapy\" (HAART), can successfully reduce viral load in infected individuals to below the level of detection for a number of years (Gulick et al., 1997; Hammer et al., 1997; Hicks et al., 2004) and the advent of HAART has considerably improved the prognosis for HIV infected individuals. However, HAART may ultimately not be \"highly active\" and failing regimens are associated with the development of drug resistant virus, often contributed to by lack of compliance, due to difficult regimens and significant side effects associated with some inhibitors (Hammer and Pedneault, 2000) . Furthermore, although there are nineteen approved RT and protease inhibitors, resistance to some inhibitors can confer crossresistance to other members within the same class reducing the number of effective treatment options for some individuals.",

The long-term side effects of these agents remain to be established, and experience with approved antiretrovirals would indicate that monotherapy directed against any target is likely to rapidly select for resistant viruses. However, addition of these investigational agents to an optimized background antiretroviral regimen may provide clinical benefit in patients with multi-drug-resistant viruses. Furthermore, combination therapy employing inhibitors directed against distinct targets, or with distinct modes of action against a single target, together with current antiretrovirals, will likely offer improved prospects for containment of viral replication in first line therapy. Figure 2 : HIV entry and its inhibition. Binding of gp120 to heparan sulfates or lectins on the cell surface promotes HIV attachment to target cells. These interactions can augment infection efficiency but are dispensable for entry. The interaction of gp120 with CD4 initiates a series of interactions which are indispensable for viral entry. Binding of gp120 to CD4 induces conformational changes in Env that lead to the formation/exposure of a coreceptor binding site and trigger the exposure of structures in gp41 involved in membrane fusion. Subsequent binding of gp120 to coreceptor triggers further conformational changes in gp41 that promote the merger between the viral and the cellular membrane. Polyanions inhibit gp120 engagement of heparan sulfates, while antibodies prevent gp120 binding to lectins. CD4M33 and PRO-542 target the CD4 binding site of gp120 and block binding to cellular CD4. CV-N recognizes high-mannose carbohydrates on gp120 and inhibits gp120 engagement of CD4 and coreceptor, however, the precise mechanism of action of this agent remains to be determined. BMS-378806 targets the CD4 binding site in gp120 and arrests gp120 in a rigid conformation, thereby preventing the exposure of epitopes in gp41 involved in membrane fusion. Binding of gp120 to CCR5 can be inhibited by the CCR5 antagonists SCH-D, UK-427,857 and GSK873140. The peptide inhibitors T-20 (enfuvirtide/fuzeon) and T1249 mimic the HR2 region in gp41 and bind to HR1, thereby preventing the back-folding of HR2 onto HR1, which is required for membrane fusion.

Then three HR2 regions, from individual gp41 subunits, are thought to fold to interact with grooves formed between three associated HR1 subunits, forming a highly stable six-helix bundle structure (Chan et al., 1997; Weissenhorn et al., 1997) . This brings the amino and carboxyterminal regions of the ectodomain of gp41 into proximity and, in consequence, the target cell membrane and viral membrane are brought into apposition. Six-helix bundle formation also pulls a fusion pore in the target cell membrane, and pore formation by a number of Env trimers is thought to cooperatively bring about fusion of viral and cellular lipid membranes (Kuhmann et al., 2000; Melikyan et al., 2000) .",

Some of these interactions are essential for entry, others boost entry efficiency but are ultimately dispensable for infection, however, all are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. While most inhibitors directed against HIV Env face the same problems as the antiretrovirals used in current HAART -i.e. high variability of HIV and rapid outgrowth of resistant viruses -agents directed against invariant cellular factors involved in HIV entry might have a more sustained effect. Since HIV Env mediated membrane fusion is initiated at the cell surface (Smith and Helenius, 2004) , this process can be efficiently targeted by non-membrane permeable inhibitors like antibodies or certain peptidic agents directed against structures intimately involved in the merger between viral and cellular membranes. In contrast, similar compounds might be less or non-effective against viruses which fuse with the membrane of endosomal vesicles, like influenza or vesicular stomatitis virus (Smith and Helenius, 2004) . Thus, HIV entry is vulnerable to compounds with different chemical properties and modes of action. However, only inhibitors that are effective in the low nanomolar range in vitro and that are ideally orally bioavailable and reach effective concentrations systemically, with a reasonable half-life and minimal side effects, are likely to be successful in the clinic. Nevertheless, compounds that do not fit some of these criteria, for example those lacking oral bioavailability or with unwanted side effects upon systemic administration, might still be beneficial when applied topically within a microbicide formulation, aimed at preventing HIV transmission at mucosal sites (Shattock and Solomon, 2004; Shattock and Moore, 2003) .",

The lectins dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN related (DC-SIGNR, also termed L-SIGN, for liver SIGN) promote HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV infection and might play an important role in viral dissemination (reviewed in Baribaud et al., 2002a; van Kooyk and Geijtenbeek, 2003) . Thus, it has been postulated that DC-SIGN on submucosal dendritic cells can capture sexually transmitted HIV and that virus loaded cells could then migrate into lymphoid tissue where the virus could be transferred to adjoining T-cells -a process that might boost HIV spread in and between infected individuals (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) . In contrast, expression of DC-SIGNR on endothelial cells lining liver and lymph node sinusoids as well as in placenta (Bashirova et al., 2001; P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001) might endow these cells with the ability to capture blood borne HIV and transfer it to transmigrating T-cells or adjacent macrophages. Moreover, DC-SIGNR might promote HIV infection of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (Steffan et al., 1992) and these cells might constantly release new virions into the blood",

Furthermore, binding of virus to heparan sulfates on brain microsvascular endothelial cells followed by transcytosis of viral particles might also promote HIV infection of the brain (Argyris et al., 2003; Bobardt et al., 2004b; Liu et al., 2002) . The interaction of HIV with cellular heparan sulfates can be inhibited by anionic polymers that are negatively charged at neutral pH (Shattock and Moore, 2003) . These compounds can be employed within a microbicide formulation to prevent HIV transmission (Shattock and Moore, 2003) . The precise mechanism of action of polyanionic inhibitors is unclear, however, it has been suggested that they mainly target the positively charged V3 loop in Env and inhibit binding to coreceptor (Vives et al., 2005) , which requires V3 function (Hartley et al., 2005) . In this regard it is of note that V3 regions of R5-tropic viruses usually exhibit a lower positive charge than V3 regions of X4-tropic viruses and consequently polyanions inhibit the latter viruses more potently (Hartley et al., 2005) . Interestingly, HIV can acquire resistance to polyanionic inhibitors and resistant viruses exhibit multiple changes in gp120 (Bobardt et al., 2004a) , confirming that Env is indeed the major target of these compounds. Resistant variants are still capable of infecting cells that do not express heparan sulfate containing proteoglycans with high efficiency, but exhibit markedly reduced ability to infect cells that express these structures (Bobardt et al., 2004a) . Engagement of heparan sulfate harboring structures can thus impact HIV cell tropism and infectivity, validating this interaction as a target for inhibition.",

            "text": "stream. Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind to high-mannose glycans in Env (Feinberg et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003a) and, upon expression on certain cell lines, facilitate infection in cis and in trans (Trumpfheller et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004) . Augmentation of HIV infectivity by DC-SIGN expressing cell lines might involve internalization and intracellular transport of virus particles (Kwon et al., 2002; McDonald et al., 2003) . However, recent studies on a widely used cell culture system for DC-SIGN function revealed that these observations might have been confounded by productive infection of the lectin expressing cells in a CD4 and coreceptor dependent manner (Nobile et al., 2005) . Similarly, dendritic cell mediated HIV infection in trans, which has been mainly attributed to DC-SIGN function by some laboratories, probably involves direct infection of these cells and might also be promoted by HIV engagement of other lectins (Nobile et al., 2005; Turville et al., 2002) . While these studies call a major role of DC-SIGN in HIV infection into question, two recent observations underline that DC-SIGN is likely important for HIV spread. First, inhibitors of DC-SIGN reduce HIV transmission in a mucosal explant model (Hu et al., 2004) , suggesting that a microbicide formulation should contain DC-SIGN inhibitors to be effective. Second, and perhaps more relevant, polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN gene can modulate the risk of HIV-1 infection , at least upon certain routes of transmission (Martin et al., 2004b) and it has been suggested that reduced DC-SIGN expression might hamper viral dissemination. Therefore, inhibition of DC-SIGN in HIV infected individuals might also be associated with a therapeutic benefit. Moreover, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR interact with a variety of viral and non viral pathogens (van Kooyk and Geijtenbeek, 2003) , among them Ebolavirus (Alvarez et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2003) , hepatitis C virus (Gardner et al., 2003; Lozach et al., 2003) , SARS associated coronavirus (Jeffers et al., 2004; Marzi et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) , Mycobacterium (Geijtenbeek et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2003) and Leishmania (Colmenares et al., 2002) , suggesting that inhibitors of these lectins might be useful for treatment of a variety of infectious diseases. Several antibodies have been described that potently block binding of ligands to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Baribaud et al., 2002b; Wu et al., 2002) and these reagents could be employed to inhibit sexual transmission of HIV. However, the in vivo potency of these antibodies still needs to be assessed in an experimental model such as SIV infection of macaques. Macaque and human DC-SIGN are equally adept in transmitting immunoeficiency viruses (Baribaud et al., 2001b; Geijtenbeek et al., 2001) and both are expressed in the genital mucosa (Jameson et al., 2002) , underlining that experiments to block DC-SIGN in macaques would yield valuable information on the validity of this target in humans. Since DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR recognize carbohydrates on the surface of ligands, it will be difficult to generate conventional small molecule inhibitors. However, glycodendritic structures that present multiple mannose residues prevent ligand binding to DC-SIGN and could be employed as microbicides (Lasala et al., 2003; Rojo and Delgado, 2004) . Finally, HIV engagement of DC-SIGN could be inhibited by compounds that bind glycans in the HIV-Env and such inhibitors are described below.",

CV-N can interfere with gp120 binding to both CD4 and coreceptor (Dey et al., 2000) , however, the precise mechanism of inhibition needs to be determined. The structure of CV-N has been solved (Bewley et al., 1998) and two carbohydrate binding sites with different affinities have been identified (Shenoy et al., 2002) , however, only the high affinity binding site is required for inhibition of HIV infection (Chang and Bewley, 2002) . CV-N is present in solution as a monomer or a domain swapped dimer and both exhibit comparable antiviral activity (Barrientos et al., 2004) . When applied topically as a microbicide, CV-N can inhibit infection of macaques by a simian/human immunodeficiency virus hybrid (SHIV) upon vaginal (Tsai et al., 2004) and rectal (Tsai et al., 2003) challenge without eliciting major side effects, indicating the CV-N is a promising candidate compound for a microbicide formulation targeting HIV. Compounds with a similar mode of action might, at least in theory, be suitable for HIV-therapy. However, HIV can acquire resistance against such inhibitors by partially removing its carbohydrate shield . Such variants are at least partially resistant to compounds that target glycans, like CV-N or the antibody 2G12 (directed against a carbohydrate epitope in HIV Env) , and these variants are likely to exhibit enhanced neutralization sensitivity.",

In contrast, binding of gp120 to CD4 is essential for HIV-1 entry into target cells. The structures of CD4 (Ryu et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1990; Wu et al., 1997) , gp120 (Chen et al., 2005a; Chen et al., 2005b) , and gp120 bound to CD4 and a neutralizing antibody fragment (Kwong et al., 1998) have been determined on the atomic level and the interface between CD4 and gp120 is therefore well characterized. Thus, 22 amino acids in domain 1 (D1) of CD4, particularly those located in the CDR2-like loop, contact 26 residues in gp120, located in a cavity formed at the interface between the inner and outer domain and the bridging sheet of gp120 (Kwong et al., 1998) . Despite, the wealth of information on the structures involved in gp120 binding to CD4, the screening for small molecule inhibitors targeting this interaction has thus far been unsuccessful. Antibodies that target the gp120 binding site in CD4 and block HIV infection are available, however, concerns have been raised that systemic administration of such antibodies might cause immunodeficiency (Shattock and Moore, 2003) . Nevertheless, a single dose of a humanized antibody, that targets a different domain in CD4 (domain 2 (D2)) to block HIV entry, reduced viral load in infected individuals without eliciting major side effects , indicating that this agent warrants further evaluation. Structure based approaches have been employed to inhibit the interaction between CD4 and gp120 and are discussed below.",

Moreover, small proteins, that harbor the gp120 binding site of CD4 have also been generated and shown to have potent antiviral effects. Thus, 31 amino acids comprising the CRD2-like loop of CD4 were originally transferred onto a structural scaffold derived from the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin (Vita et al., 1999) , and the protein was subsequently optimized for efficient gp120 binding and antiviral activity and its structure determined (Huang et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2003) . The most active compound generated, CD4M33, inhibited primary HIV isolates in the nanomolar range and induced structural changes in Env comparable to those triggered by binding to cellular CD4 (Huang et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2003) . Although this compound has the general disadvantages of peptide inhibitors, such as low bioavailability and antigenicity, CD4M33 and derivatives thereof could be used as microbicides and, in combination with gp120, within vaccine formulations, since CD4M33 bound gp120 exposes otherwise hidden epitopes which may elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (Huang et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2003) .",

PRO 542 is tetravalent and is most likely capable of cross linking Env timers on the surface of virions or infected cells (Zhu et al., 2001) , explaining its superior antiviral activity compared to previously investigated divalent compounds. The compound neutralizes primary and laboratory adapted HIV-1 strains independently of coreceptor usage (Gauduin et al., 1996; Trkola et al., 1998; Trkola et al., 1995) , protects SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice harboring human peripheral blood mononuclear cells against challenge with primary HIV-1 isolates (Gauduin et al., 1998) , inhibits HIV-1 infection in a mucosal explant model (Hu et al., 2004) and reduces viral load in HIV-1 infected individuals upon a single administration Jacobson et al., 2000) . Since no appreciable side effects were observed in PRO 542 treated individuals the compound merits further testing and could ultimately be employed for salvage therapy of patients with late stage AIDS or within a microbicide formulation.",

BMS-806 binds to gp120 and was originally shown to inhibit the interaction with CD4, suggesting that BMS-806 might target the CD4 binding site in gp120 (Lin et al., 2003b) . Two further observations supported such a mode of action. First, BMS-806 was shown to inhibit CD4independent viruses (viral variants that do no require CD4 binding for infection but usually infect cells with higher efficiency in the presence of CD4) only when CD4 was expressed on target cells. Second, viruses that acquired resistance against the compound exhibited alterations in the CD4 binding site in gp120 (Guo et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003b) . Thus, it was suggested that BMS-806 blocks HIV-1 entry by preventing gp120 binding to CD4. However, subsequent studies indicate that BMS-806 might exert its inhibitory activity in a different fashion Si et al., 2004) . Thus, no inhibitory effect of BMS-806 on gp120 binding to CD4 (or coreceptor) was observed and CD4-independent viruses were equally sensitive to BMS-806 inhibition in the context of target cells expressing receptor and coreceptor or coreceptor alone Si et al., 2004) . These reports proposed that BMS-806 targets the recessed CD4 binding site and, instead of directly inhibiting CD4 binding to gp120, blocks structural rearrangements in Env that are normally induced by CD4 binding, as BMS-806 prevented the exposure of a structure in gp41 involved in the membrane fusion reaction (Si et al., 2004) . Structural analysis of gp120 in the absence of ligand indicates that BMS-806 might stabilize the unliganded conformation of Env and supports the finding that BMS-806 might act by inhibiting conformational changes required for fusion (Chen et al., 2005b) . In either case, BMS-806 is orally bioavailable and is highly effective at least against subtype B viruses (Lin et al., 2003b) , therefore compounds such as BMS-806 warrant further evaluation.",

Thus, compounds that block CXCR4 use by HIV are also under evaluation (reviewed in detail in (De Clercq, 2003; Schols, 2004) ). Several such agents, usually positively charged compounds that specifically interact with the negatively charged surface of CXCR4, have been identified and shown to inhibit the spread of X4-tropic viruses in culture. However, CXCR4 and its natural ligand SDF are critical for hematopoiesis, cardiac function and cerebellar development (Nagasawa et al., 1996; Zou et al., 1998) , therefore inhibition of CXCR4 may be associated with unwanted side effects. Indeed, development of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was halted due to side effects, as well as the lack of oral absorption. AMD070, a follow up CXCR4 antagonist with oral bioavailability, is currently in clinical development and was generally well tolerated in Phase I trials (Schols et al., 2003; Stone et al., 2004) . As with AMD3100, CXCR4 antagonism by AMD070 results in a mobilization of white blood cells from the bone marrow (Stone et al., 2004) , for which the long-term consequences are unknown. Therefore, agents that block CXCR4 usage by HIV without interfering with the natural function of CXCR4 would be desirable.",

            "text": "As with other antiretroviral agents, viruses can acquire resistance to coreceptor inhibitors. Several resistance mechanisms are possible, however the virus might not always escape by the most obvious route. Thus, a switch from CCR5 to CXCR4 usage and vice versa has been observed when one coreceptor was blocked (Este et al., 1999; Mosier et al., 1999) . Also, culture of viruses in cells that express CXCR4 in the presence of a CXCR4 inhibitor can lead to selection of resistant viruses that use this coreceptor in the presence of inhibitor (de Vreese et al., 1996; Kanbara et al., 2001; Schols et al., 1998) . Both findings are not unexpected given the variability in HIV Env and a certain degree of flexibility in gp120 interactions with coreceptor. Strikingly, however, in an experimental setting in which both CCR5 and CXCR4 were available, a R5-tropic HIV-1 isolate chose to adapt to CCR5 usage in the presence of drug rather than adapting to utilize CXCR4 (Trkola et al., 2002) . Resistance was associated with changes in Env that reduced affinity for CCR5 and diminished entry into CCR5 expressing cell lines, but presumably allowed CCR5 engagement in the presence of drug (Kuhmann et al., 2004; Trkola et al., 2002) . These observations indicate that a coreceptor switch, for which as little as one to three substitutions in the V3 loop can be sufficient (Pastore et al., 2004; P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2004; Shimizu et al., 1999; Shioda et al., 1994) , might, at least under some circumstances, be associated with a considerable disadvantage to the virus. In such cases, the emergence of viruses that engage coreceptor in the presence of drug can be the consequence. If these results reflect the situation in HIV-1 infected patients treated with CCR5 inhibitors, the emergence of X4-tropic viruses might not be a general phenomenon. Nevertheless, HIV escape from CCR5 inhibitors by adaptation to CXCR4 usage, which is associated with disease progession, remains a major concern The use of CCR5 inhibitors will therefore require careful evaluation of relevant clinical parameters, including determination of the coreceptor tropism of patient derived viruses in order to maximize the potential therapeutic benefit of these inhibitors.",

Coreceptor binding then induces further conformational rearrangements in gp41 that facilitate fusion of the viral and the host cell membrane. As described above, the latter conformational changes in gp41 involves association of two helical regions, HR1 and HR2, which fold back onto each other to drive the formation of the six helix bundle, a structure intimately associated with membrane fusion. This process is conserved between class I fusion proteins of different viruses and can sometimes be inhibited by peptides that mimic either HR1 or HR2, with HR2 derived peptides often being more effective (Eckert and Kim, 2001) . Enfuvirtide (T-20/Fuzeon) is a 36 amino acid peptide comprising sequences derived from HR2 and can efficiently block HIV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo (Kilby et al., 1998) . Use of enfuvirtide for therapy of individuals with multi drug resistant virus was approved after the demonstration that enfuvirtide treatment does not elicit major unwanted side effects and that administration of the compound in combination with an optimized RT-and proteaseinhibitor regimen is more effective than treatment with RT-and proteaseinhibitors alone . Enfuvirtide is the first entry inhibitor approved for therapy of HIV-1 infection and serves as proof of principle that inhibition of HIV entry is a promising new avenue for HIV drug development.",

Despite, the encouraging antiviral activity of T-1249, clinical trials to further evaluate the compound have been halted (Martin-Carbonero, 2004) . A major disadvantage of enfuvirtide and T-1249 is the requirement for administration by twice daily intramuscular injection. This issue could be improved or resolved by methods to increase the circulatory half-life of these peptides or by devising improved delivery strategies for these drugs. Furthermore, the search for orally bioavailable small molecules that inhibit the membrane fusion machinery in gp41 is underway. Two such compounds have recently been described as potential leads .",

Thus, low Envcoreceptor affinity or low coreceptor expression is associated with enhanced susceptibility to coreceptor antagonists (Reeves et al., 2002; Reeves et al., 2004) . Less intuitively perhaps, these factors also affect susceptibility to the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (Reeves et al., 2002; Reeves et al., 2004) . Mechanistically, a reduction in Env-coreceptor affinity or coreceptor levels can result in a slower rate of membrane fusion, which in consequence extends exposure of the temporal target for enfuvirtide (Reeves et al., 2002; Reeves et al., 2004) . These factors likely explain synergistic inhibition of HIV by coreceptor antagonists and enfuvirtide in vitro (Tremblay, 2004; Tremblay et al., 2002; Tremblay et al., 2000) . Thus, coreceptor antagonists will act to block Env-coreceptor binding and also, in effect, reduce the number of cell surface coreceptors available for Env interaction, thereby delaying fusion and enhancing enfuvirtide susceptibility. The use of a combination of these entry inhibitors for antiretroviral therapy, with or without RT and/or protease inhibitors, remains to be evaluated, as does the impact of Env-coreceptor affinity and coreceptor levels on entry inhibitor potency in vivo.",

While CXCR4 utilizing viruses are associated with pathogenesis, it still remains to be established whether their emergence is a cause or effect of disease progression. Thus, the clinical efficacy of CCR5 antagonists will require careful evaluation. Another factor specific to the utilization of coreceptor inhibitors is the requirement for determination of viral coreceptor specificity prior to treatment. Thus, a CCR5 antagonist will not be active against CXCR4 utilizing viruses and vice versa. Furthermore, the utilization of a CCR5 antagonist in individuals harboring a mixed population of R5, X4 and dual-tropic viruses might select for outgrowth of X4 and/or dual-tropic viruses. Again, any potential impact of this scenario on disease progression remains to be determined. The use of a combination of coreceptor antagonist that target both CCR5 and CXCR4 would alleviate these concerns, however there remains the potential for virus to escape these inhibitors by adapting to utilize drug bound coreceptor (as discussed above) or by utilizing one of a number of alternative coreceptors that can mediate infection in vitro (Berger et al., 1999) .",

For HIV, the points of joining of each end of the viral DNA are staggered by five base pairs across the major groove of the target DNA helix. After joining, the intervening five base pairs are melted, yielding gaps at the junctions of proviral and target DNA. The integration reaction is completed when the two protruding 5' proviral nucleotides are trimmed and the gaps repaired, most likely by host repair enzymes (Daniel et al., 2004; Yoder and Bushman, 2000) .",

            "text": "HIV integrase is a critical component for the integration reaction. Integrase is encoded by the 3' end of the pol gene and is produced as a result of protease-mediated cleavage of the gag-pol precursor. The integrase enzyme is 288 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 32kDa. Residues 1-50 comprise the amino-terminal domain (NTD), 50-212 the catalytic core domain (CCD) and 212-288 the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). The fulllength structure of integrase complexed with viral DNA has eluded scientists for many years due to solubility difficulties with the complex. In the interim, many groups have used X-ray diffraction or solution NMR and solved the structures of individual integrase domains, the CCD complexed with the NTD and the CCD complexed with the CTD and two domain fragments (Bujacz et al., 1995; Cai et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2000a; Chen et al., 2000b; Dyda et al., 1994; Eijkelenboom et al., 1997; Goldgur et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2001) . The NTD is characterized by a conserved two histidine and two cysteine motif, HX 3-7 HX 23-32 CX 2 C (referred to as the HHCC motif), that binds zinc (Burke et al., 1992; Bushman et al., 1993 Bushman et al., 1993 Cai et al., 1997; Eijkelenboom et al., 1997) . This HHCC motif is essential for 3' processing and strand transfer activity in vitro and has been shown to promote 1996). The CCD contains a D,DX35E motif formed by the catalytic triad D64, D116 and E152 embedded in a protein fold that is highly conserved among polynucleotide phosphotransferase enzymes (Bujacz et al., 1995; Dyda et al., 1994; Goldgur et al., 1998; Greenwald et al., 1999; Maignan et al., 1998) . Two monomeric core domains associate to form a dimer in solution, with each monomer being structurally similar to RNaseH, MuA transposase and RuvC resolvase, (Chiu and Davies, 2004) . The D64 and the D116 residues form a coordination complex with a divalent metal (Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ) once the integrase binds to its DNA substrate (Gao et al., 2004; Grobler et al., 2002; Marchand et al., 2003) . The CCD requires the NTD and the CTD in a dimeric complex in order to maintain its 3' processing and strand transfer activities and mutation in any one of the three conserved D64, D116 or E152 residues abolishes this activity. The CTD sequence is less conserved and the overall structure resembles the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain (Eijkelenboom et al., 1995; Lodi et al., 1995) . The CTD binds DNA non-specifically and is required for 3' processing and strand transfer activities.",

Currently there are no known human homologs of HIV integrase, making this enzyme a very Greenwald et al., 1999; Lodi et al., 1995; Maignan et al., 1998; tetramerization of integrase protomers and to enhance activity (Cannon et al., 1994; Ellison et al., 1995; Engelman et al., 1995 Engelman et al., 1995 Zheng et al., attractive drug target. There are a number of criteria that are adhered to in screening integrase inhibitors. The inhibitor must have low cell toxicity and be specific for the integration step and not any of the other steps in the HIV lifecycle. Cells treated with the inhibitor should show an accumulation of 2-LTR circles, which is a by-product of unproductive integration, and cells should have a decreased number of integrated proviruses. Selection of drugresistant viruses should also be shown to be a result of mutations solely in the integrase enzyme. This is usually verified by testing the inhibitor against recombinant integrase bearing the same mutations identified in the drugresistant virus. Unfortunately, numerous drugs that inhibit integrase fail these criteria, especially in cell culture (see (Li et al., 2004; Pommier et al., 2000; Pommier and Neamati, 1999) for examples). Several assays exist for assessing integrase inhibition (reviewed in (Butler et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 1999; Witvrouw et al., 2004) ). The classical assays use LTR mimics to evaluate the 3' processing and strand transfer activities of integrase in the presence of inhibitors (Craigie et al., 1991; Sherman and Fyfe, 1990) . To date, the only class of integrase inhibitors that meet all of the above criteria is the diketo acids and their related naphthyridines. Another class of inhibitors called pyranodipyrimidines is currently under study and is hoped to provide an alternative to the diketo acid inhibitor family. Several other integrase inhibitors are currently under investigation and will advance our knowledge of integrase function and will ultimately help to define far superior integrase inhibitors in the future. These inhibitors are far too numerous to discuss here and so readers are referred to several reviews on these inhibitors Pommier et al., 2005; Pommier et al., 2000; Pommier and Neamati, 1999; Pommier et al., 1997) .",

Ltd (Goldgur et al., 1999) . The diketo acids were the first reported integrase inhibitors that showed high specificity for the integration reaction and antiviral activity in cells (Goldgur et al., 1999; Hazuda et al., 2000) . The diketo moiety is usually flanked by an acidic group or an equivalent group such as a carboxyl, tetrazole or triazole group, and an aromatic group. Several substitutions of the aromatic group have been studied and shown to be critical for activity (Marchand et al., 2003; Marchand et al., 2002; Pais et al., 2002; Wai and al., 2000) . The diketo acids selectively recognize a particular conformation of the integrase active site only after it assembles on the viral DNA ends. Once bound, the diketo acids compete with the target DNA and inhibit strand transfer, most likely by sequestering the active site metal (Mg 2+ ) Grobler et al., 2002; Pommier et al., 2005) . Merck increased enthusiasm in the field when they showed that naphthyridines (derivatives of diketo acids) have potent antiviral activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) with no cross-resistance to drugs that target other aspects of the viral lifecycle Pluymers et al., 2002) . At that time, L-870,810 was the most promising diketo acid, having the most potent anti-viral activity and entered clinical trials. However, L-870,810 studies were recently halted due to liver and kidney toxicity observed in dogs. Currently, Merck is developing the integrase inhibitors L-870,812 and Compound B. L-870,812 has been tested in rhesus macaques and has been shown to suppress viremia and chronic infections caused by SIV .",

In contrast to the diketo acids, V-165 was shown to have inhibitory effects against both the 3' processing and strand transfer activities in enzymatic assays, however in cell culture the anti-HIV activity of V-165 appears to correlate with inhibition of the strand transfer activity during integration. The mechanism of this inhibition is likely attributed to inhibition of integrase-DNA complex formation . Interestingly, V-165 remained fully effective against viruses resistant to the diketo inhibitors and inhibitors of viral entry and reverse transcription (Fikkert et al., 2004; Fikkert et al., 2003; Pannecouque et al., 2002) . Recently some mutations in the RT and env genes of resistant viruses that altered viral phenotype was reported (Cold Spring Harbor Retrovirus Meeting May 2005) and therefore further studies on the characterization of V-165-resistant HIV strains are required to verify that V-165 specifically targets integrase.",

Thus there is a pressing need for new antiretroviral agents that are active against viruses resistant to current drugs. Indeed, new inhibitors to current drug targets as well as inhibitors to new drug targets are in various stages of development, fueled by advances in our understanding of the viral life cycle. The life cycle of HIV presents numerous potential targets for intervention, and, as reviewed here, inhibitors to new targets that are furthest along in development include agents that interfere with various steps of the entry process, compounds that inhibit the integration of HIV into the host cell genome and an agent that prevents the formation of mature infectious virions. Distinct modes of action from approved antiretrovirals mean that these inhibitors will likely be effective against viruses resistant to current drugs. Furthermore, the use of a combination of inhibitors directed against distinct targets in first line therapy holds promise for enhanced viral containment. Entry inhibitors are also being developed as candidate microbicides and hold promise for the prevention of HIV transmission.",
