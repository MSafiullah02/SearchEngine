Cells were cultured for 72 h in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations (1\u201050 \u03bcg/ml) of MY7, SJ1D1, or WM15. Cell growth was markedly reduced in anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010treated samples, when compared with isotype\u2010matched IgG1, vehicle, or no treatment (Fig. 2A\n). Moreover, no effect was observed with an irrelevant mAb recognizing proteinase TACE constitutively expressed at the surface of U937 cells (Fig. 2A\n). The IC50 values were ~5 \u03bcg/ml at 72 h. Kinetic studies revealed a time\u2010dependent, inhibitory effect of anti\u2010CD13 mAbs on U937 cell growth (Fig. 2B\n). Cell growth arrest was accompanied by reduction in DNA content to sub\u2010G1 levels (Fig. 2C\n for MY7; data not shown for SJ1D1 and WM15) and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2D\n) characteristic of apoptosis. Moreover, the average diameter of dead cells (\u22649 \u03bcm) was smaller than that of living cells. Apoptosis was further confirmed by phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface, with consequential annexin V\u2010FITC binding. Indeed, annexin\u2010V binding was higher in anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010treated cells than in untreated cells or those treated with IgG1, anti\u2010TACE, or vehicle (Fig. 3A\n).

Cells were incubated with MY7 (20 \u03bcg/ml) for 6 and 18 h at 37\u00b0C. As seen in Fig. 5Ac\n, surface CD13 levels fell over time on MY7\u2010treated cells but did not change on untreated cells (Fig. 5Aa\n) and IgG1\u2010treated cells (Fig. 5Ab\n). Accordingly, the surface APN activity of U937 cells was specifically decreased by stimulation with MY7 (Fig. 5B\n). No significant differences in intracellular CD13 staining were observed for untreated cells and IgG1\u2010 and MY7\u2010treated cells (data not shown). In parallel, enzymatic assays on culture medium from untreated cells and IgG1\u2010 and MY7\u2010treated cells were performed (i.e., to check that surface CD13 down\u2010regulation did not result from shedding into the culture medium). Nonstimulated cells released low levels of soluble APN (<10% of the total APN activity in intact cells; Fig. 5C\n). When U937 cells were activated with PMA (i.e., a positive control), surface CD13 expression and activity rose (Fig. 5A, B\n). This increase was accompanied by the release of soluble APN (with a significant, 5.7\u2010fold enhancement at 18 h; Fig. 5C\n). In contrast, the APN activity released from MY7\u2010treated cells did not vary over time, when compared with untreated and IgG1\u2010treated cells (Fig. 5C\n). These findings indicate that CD13 down\u2010regulation by MY7 likely results from cell internalization of CD13\u2010MY7 complexes.",

To establish whether caspases 3, 8, and/or 9 are activated during anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010mediated apoptosis, we studied the ability of U937 cell lysates to cleave chromogenic substrates of these enzymes. Untreated U937 cells display similarly low baseline levels of all three caspase activities. Etoposide (1 \u03bcM) was used as a positive control, since it triggers U937 cell death by activating these caspases (34, 35) (Fig. 7A\n). Kinetic studies indicated that cell treatment with MY7 (35 \u03bcg/ml) resulted in a time\u2010dependent increase in all three caspase activities, relative to untreated cells (Fig. 7A\n). Accordingly, Western blot analyses showed that exposure of U937 cells to MY7 induced the cleavage of the downstream caspase\u20103 substrate poly ADP\u2010ribose polymerase\u20101 (PARP\u20101) (Fig. 7A\n). To determine whether the initiator caspase in the extrinsic pathway (i.e., caspase\u20108) or the intrinsic pathway (i.e., caspase\u20109) is involved in the apoptotic action of MY7, we examined the effects of a broad\u2010spectrum caspase inhibitor (Z\u2010VAD\u2010fmk) and selective inhibitors of caspase\u20108 (Z\u2010IETD\u2010fmk) and caspase\u20109 (Ac\u2010LEHD\u2010CHO) on cell viability.

In a fluorescence\u2010based assay, the exposure of U937 cells to MY7 (35 \u03bcg/ml) induced a time\u2010dependent decrease in the MMP (Fig. 8A\n). Mitochondrial membrane depolarization can result from the action of proapoptotic and/or antiapoptotic members of the Bcl\u20102 family (36). Therefore, we measured expression levels of Bad, Bax, and Bid proapoptotic proteins and Bcl\u20102 and Mcl\u20101 antiapoptotic proteins before and after MY7 treatment. Untreated cells expressed high levels of Bax, Bcl\u20102, Bid, and Mcl\u20101 (Fig. 8B\n). No changes were observed when cells were treated with control IgG1 (Fig. 8B\n). Consistently with previous studies in U937 cells, Bcl\u20102 and Mcl\u20101 levels were lower in etoposide\u2010treated cells (34, 37, 38) than in untreated cells (Fig. 8B\n).

MY7 and WM15 were obtained after immunization with blasts from AML patients (25, 40), whereas SJ1D1 was raised against CD13 from the myeloid cell line KG1 (25). The epitopes on CD13 bound by SJ1D1 and MY7 are very close together. The WM15 binding site overlaps that cooccupied by SJ1D1 (25). In contrast to MY7 and SJ1D1, WM15 inhibits the APN activity of CD13 (25, 41). In the present study, we showed that all anti\u2010CD13 mAbs recognize similar levels of surface CD13 on the AML cell line U937 (FAB M5) and on M0\u2010, M1\u2010, M2\u2010, M4\u2010, and M5\u2010subtype primary AML cells.

Bestatin is the most frequently used CD13/APN inhibitor, although it does interact with other aminopeptidases, such as leucyl\u2010aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) and aminopeptidase W (EC 3.4.11.16) in myeloid cells (1). In this context, we had previously synthesized a series of novel flavone\u20108\u2010acetic acid derivatives and selected DNFAA as an efficient APN inhibitor (18). Bestatin and DNFAA are both slow\u2010binding, competitive inhibitors of APN (1). When used at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, which inhibits APN activity (30\u201040 fold above the IC50 values), bestatin and DNFAA did not alter cell growth and survival, implying that CD13's APN activity is not required for this process. It is noteworthy that higher doses of bestatin used in previous studies might inhibit other aminopeptidase activities (1, 42). Inhibitory effects observed with high doses of bestatin (\u2265145 \u03bcM) likely reflect bestatin intracellular effects (42).",

            "text": "Internalization of the CD13/anti\u2010CD13 mAb complex suggests the existence of a signal pathway engaged by CD13. The short intracellular intracytoplasmic tail of CD13 neither contains a death domain nor a conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based activation motif ITAM to directly couple CD13 to intracellular effectors for inducing a cascade of events leading to cell activation. This suggests that signaling induced by the CD13/anti\u2010CD13 mAb complex could be mediated by the physical interaction with other signaling molecules. Two studies have shown that CD13 colocalizes with Fc\u03b3RI/CD64 on monocytes (43, 44). The receptors for the Fc portion of IgG are signaling molecules that require Syk activation. We found that isotype control IgG1 did not influence cell growth, surface CD64 was not affected by MY7 treatment, and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol did not block the proapoptotic effect of MY7. These results, therefore, indicate that Fc\u03b3RI/CD64 does not potentiate MY7's effect on U937 cells. In U937 cells, the WM15 and SJ1D1 mAbs induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, and inhibitors of PI3K were able to decrease their phosphorylation (45). Activated PI3K localizes to the plasma membrane and catalyzes the \u03b3\u2010phosphate transfer of ATP to phosphoinositides needed for phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) generation and calcium signaling (46). Free Ca2+ is reported to induce mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which can trigger mitochondrial membrane depolarization and release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins (47). PIP3, in turn, activates downstream substrates, including the serine/threonine kinase AKT (46). Our data obtained with the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and AKT strongly suggest the implication of these kinases in the signaling cascade involved in MY7\u2010mediated growth arrest. Anti\u2010CD13 mAbs MY7, WM15, and Leu\u2010M7 induced Ca2+ release in monocytes and U937 cells (48, 49). Furthermore, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the proapoptotic activity of anti\u2010CD13 mAbs.",

In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, mitochondria may function as an amplifier by activating the downstream caspases 9 and 3 (33, 50). In the present study, anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspase\u20109 and caspase\u20103, and cleaved PARP\u20101 (a major substrate of caspase\u20103) in U937 cells. The broad\u2010spectrum caspase inhibitor Z\u2010VAD\u2010fmk and the caspase\u20109 inhibitor Ac\u2010LEHD\u2010CHO significantly attenuated MY7\u2010mediated apoptosis, suggesting that anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment leads (at least) to the activation of a mitochondrial (intrinsic) caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis pathway. Members of Bcl\u20102 family are important regulators of the intrinsic pathway (51). By modifying outer and inner mitochondrial membrane permeability, the Bcl\u20102 family (including proapoptotic Bad and Bax proteins and antiapoptotic Mcl\u20101 and Bcl\u20102 proteins) regulate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase activation, and PARP\u20101 cleavage (33, 51). Overexpression of Bcl\u20102 protein rescues U937 cells from apoptosis (52). While Ser\u2010136\u2010phosphorylation of Bad protects AML cells from apoptosis (39, 53), unphosphorylated Bad can favor apoptosis by sequestering Bcl\u20102 within the cytoplasm and thus preventing the latter from binding to Bax; in turn, this promotes cytochrome c release (53, 54). Our data indicate that MY7 decreased Mcl\u20101 and Bcl\u20102 levels and increased Bax levels. However, the fact that MY7 did not affect Ser\u2010136\u2010p\u2010Bad levels means that Bad is unlikely to be involved in anti\u2010CD13\u2010mediated apoptosis.

            "text": "In the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggering of death receptors (such as Fas antigen and TNF\u2010R1) leads to strong caspase\u20108 activation. This bypasses mitochondria and leads directly to caspase\u20103 activation and then apoptosis (33, 50). However, small amounts of caspase\u20108 (activated by stress\u2010induced signals within the cell) can activate the intrinsic pathway by inducing the production of truncated Bid (tBid) via the proteolytic cleavage of Bid (55). Following translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membranes, tBid stimulates efficient oligomerization of Bax and activates the intrinsic pathway (55, 56). Our data indicate that MY7 increased caspase\u20108 activity in the absence of Bid cleavage and that the caspase\u20108 inhibitor Z\u2010IETD\u2010fmk, at least in part, attenuated cell death, suggesting that MY7 can also activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Caspase\u20108 activation may be related to the extrinsic pathway, with TNF\u2010R and/or Fas antigen triggering. In the present study, very low amounts of TNF\u2010\u03b1 (\u226490 pg/ml/106 cells at 24 h) were detected in conditioned medium from U937 cells, and MY7 does not alter TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (unpublished results). Moreover, cell surface expression of Fas was not significantly modified by MY7 treatment. These data strongly suggest that anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment does not trigger death receptors. It remains to be seen whether anti\u2010CD13 mAb treatment interferes with granzyme B and perforin (which can process procaspase\u20108) (57, 58).",
