Thus, the body synthesizes RNA and then proteins according to the instructions from the DNA. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase or RNA polymerase carries the transcription . Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases: polymerase I transcribes ribosomal RNA genes (18S,5.8S and 28SrRNA), polymerase II transcribes all proteincoding genes (mRNA and small RNA), and polymerase III transcribes the genes for 5SrRNA and tRNA. In prokaryotic cells ( E. coli ), RNA polymerase consists of fi ve subunits-two identical \u03b1 subunits and one subunit each of \u03b2, \u03b2\u2032, and \u03c3 subunit. The \u03c3 subunit dissociates after polymerization ensues. Thus, the term \"holoenzyme\" is used for complete enzyme and \"core enzyme\" is used without \u03c3 subunit. The process of transcription is initiated by binding of RNA polymerase to DNA molecule at a very specifi c site called \" promoters .\"",

In eukaryotes the sequence (analogous to \u221210-consensus sequence of prokaryotes), TATAAAA, is present at \u221230 position in the promoter region. Eukaryotic promoter is shown (Fig. 4.2a ) with TATA box forming the core promoter at \u221230 position (from \u221230 to \u2212100), upstream of transcription start site. CAAT box and GC box are at approximately \u221270-90 and \u2212100, respectively. The location of promoter is always on the same DNA molecule which they regulate. They are referred as cis-acting elements. The spacing of various elements is more important and much is dependent on locus-specifi c activators, either at core promoter or at distant sites. Various other signals as enhancers are also involved which are far apart from the target gene. They exert stimulatory effects on promoter activity and can be upstream, downstream or in the middle of the gene. Promoters of housekeeping genes or genes with complex patterns of expression have CpG islands rather than TATA box. The gene to be transcribed has 5\u02b9-untranslated region (5\u02b9 UTR), exons (coding region) separated by introns (noncoding region). The end has 3\u02b9-untranslated region (3\u02b9 UTR). In the cloning for gene expression, usually intronless version of the gene is used. In eukaryotes, the transcription is further enhanced by enhancers, which may be 2,000-3,000 bases away from the promoter region but are able to affect the rate of transcription .",

Human or mammalian genes cloned in bacteria cannot undergo splicing due to lack of splicing machinery, thus intron-less version of the gene is cloned for optimum results (Fig. 4.2b ). 2. The signals involved in transcription of genes may vary; thus, the gene of interest is usually fused with bacterial gene under the control of its promoter , and the protein is obtained as a fusion product, which can be later cleaved, purifi ed, and used. 3. Lac promoter is one of the most popular bacterial promoters . However, for high-level expression, T7 promoter is also preferred (present in pET vectors . For addition of amino acids during the process of translation , as there are more than one codon for several amino acids, thus, codon biasing occurs which is the preference of a particular codon of amino acid in a particular species (Fig. 4.2c ). 5. Complexity: Eukaryotic cells have the advantage of producing fully functional and properly folded proteins. The antibodies with four subunits may be secreted by eukaryotic cells in fully functional form. On the other hand, it is very diffi cult to obtain multidomain protein from E. coli . Even if protein is obtained, the renaturation and folding in laboratory condition may either be very expensive or protein may lack its activity. 6. Lack of posttranslational modifi cations (PTMs) is the problem, which cannot be solved, and is mandatory for activity of many therapeutic proteins. The glycosylation is the most common modifi cations, and others are phosphorylation and formation of disulfi de bond, which are essentially required for the full functional capability of many human proteins. PTMs play an important role in proper protein folding, processing, stability, tissue targeting, activity, immune reactivity, and half-life of the protein. Lack of these results in insoluble, unstable, or inactive product. However, the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni has been successfully transferred to E. coli , thus opening a possibility for the production of glycosylated protein in it. Certain mutant E. coli are being developed to promote disulfi de bond formation (AD494, Origami, Rosetta-gami) with reduced protease activity (BLZ1). 7. Overproduction of recombinant protein in bacteria might result in the loss of solubility and deposition of many protein species as protein aggregates or inclusion bodies. Alteration in growth conditions might render the product in insoluble form. Many eukaryotic proteins are found trapped in inclusion bodies with resistance to further processing. Success has been obtained in purifi cation of insulin and betaferon from inclusion bodies. The retrieval of proteins using denaturating condition with subsequent refolding and renaturation might not always be easy and prove to be extremely expensive. 8. With the E. coli host, it is very diffi cult to obtain protein larger than 60 kDa in soluble form. Due to certain limitations for production of proteins in E. coli , other host systems are being discussed for production of proteins. and two N-acetylglucosamine residues.

With the yeast system, high amounts of recombinant protein are obtained, and yeast is also capable of performing posttranslational modifi cations as O-linked glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and acylation but differs drastically in patterns of N-linked glycosylation ( Fig. 4.3 ).

Cadaveric pituitaryderived gonadotropins for infertility were associated with iatrogenic transmission of CJD. Later on cadaveric pituitary hGH and gonadotropins have been replaced with recombinant GH (produced in microbial system) and recombinant gonadotropins (produced in CHO cell lines ).",

However expression may be lost due to many factors, like, if there are structural changes in the recombinant gene or inactivation or disappearance of the gene from host cell. Other factors infl uencing yield may be increase in the copy number of insert, maintenance of optimum temperature, and toxicity of the expressed protein to the host. Chromosomal integration of the foreign gene might overcome the problem of expression stability, but in plasmid -based system, high copy number leads to increased yield. 2. Posttranslational processing: Protein folding requires foldases (accelerates protein folding) and chaperones (prevents protein formation of nonnative insoluble folding intermediates). Glycosylation is complex PTM requiring consecutive steps and enzymes. Glycosylation is important as it determines protein stability, solubility, antigenicity , folding, localization, biological activity, and circulation half-life. Getting correctly glycosylated and folded protein is required for therapeutic usage. In prokaryotes, with the discovery of N-glycosylation system in Campylobacter jejuni , several other systems of O-glycosylation were unraveled in both pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria. The production of recombinant proteins is commonly done by using E. coli , yeast , or cell lines derived from insects (SF9), mice (SP2/0), or CHO, but obtaining fully human PTMs is a challenging task. Fig. 4 . 5 The fi gure shows the structure of pCAMBIA vector (cambia.org) used for plant transformation. The vector has CaMV35S promoter , multiple cloning site, and reporter gene (GUS or GFP may be used). The vector can be modifi ed to express genes for insulin (tomato) or Hep-B surface antigen (HBsAg) for recombinant therapeutics providing a human glycosylation pattern have increased attention, and the efforts are being made for the development of novel glycoengineered cell lines for production of fully glycosylated protein therapeutic. 3. Overexpression of therapeutic protein might result in the formation of inclusion bodies in prokaryotic system. Rapid intracellular protein accumulation and expression of large proteins increases the probability of aggregation. Aggregation protects proteins from proteolysis and can facilitate protein recovery. When the expressed protein is toxic to the host, the presence of protein in the inclusion body tends to protect it.",

Important thrombolytic agents are urokinase (obtained from urine), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and streptokinase (obtained from bacteria). Among these, t-PA is largely used commercially. Plasminogen activators are serine proteases, which are responsible for conversion of inactive proenzyme plasminogen (Plg-a single chain glycoprotein) to serine protease called plasmin (Plm). The plasmin degrades the network of fi brin of the blood clots ( Fig. 4.6a ). There are two immunologically unrelated groups of plasminogen activators, the 55 kDa urokinase-type-PA (u-PA) and 72 kDa tissue-type PA (t-PA) (EC 3.4.21.68). The t-PA is the physiological vascular activator consisting of single polypeptide chain of 72 kDa consisting of 527 amino acids. It shows strong activity in the presence of fi brin [ 23 ] . The potential inhibitors of the thrombolytic cascade are type I plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1 or serpin E1) and PAI-2 (secreted by placenta and present in signifi cant amount during pregnancy). They act by competing with t-PA for binding sites on fi brin thus preventing the fi brinolytic cascade. PAI-1 complexes with t-PA for binding to fi brin. Thus, truncated t-PA in which the residues responsible for interacting with PAI-1 (296-299) are replaced with four alanine amino acids and three domains (fi nger, epidermal growth factor (EGF) , and kringle 1 domains)) are deleted, and chimeric tetrapeptide Gly-His-Arg-Pro (GHRP) with high affi nity to fi brin was added. Reteplase is the deletion mutant with a prolonged half-life, in which the fi nger, EGF , and kringle 1 domains of the full-length molecule are all deleted; thus, it is not inhibited.",

There are 18 mammalian FGFs (1-10 and 16-23) which affect growth and functions of a wide variety of mesenchymal, endocrine, and nerve cells. The functions of FGFs in developmental processes include mesoderm induction, anteroposterior patterning, limb formation, neural tube induction, and brain development and in mature tissue/systems angiogenesis, keratinocyte organization, and wound healing processes. FGF is very important during normal development of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and any irregularities in their function lead to a range of developmental defects [ 1 ] . FGF1 and FGF2 show strong angiogenic properties with the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tubelike structures and the growth of new blood vessels from the preexisting vasculature. FGF7 and FGF10 (also known as keratinocyte growth factors (KGF) and KGF2, respectively) stimulate the repair of injured skin and mucosal tissues by stimulating the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of epithelial cells, and they have direct chemotactic effects on tissue remodeling. Most FGFs are secreted proteins that bind heparan sulfates and can therefore be caught up in the extracellular matrix of tissues that contain heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This allows them to act locally in a paracrine fashion. However, the FGF19 subfamily (including FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) which binds less tightly to heparan sulfates can act in an endocrine fashion on far away tissues, such as the intestine, liver, kidney, adipose, and bone. For example, FGF19 is produced by intestinal cells but acts on FGFR4-expressing liver cells to downregulate key genes in the bile acid synthase pathway; FGF23 is produced by the bone but acts on FGFR1expressing kidney cells to regulate the synthesis of vitamin D and in turn affect calcium homeostasis. FGF may be synthesized using E. coli as host system .",

( b ) This fi gure shows the production of insulin from proinsulin gene which yields insulin and C-peptide.

Resistance imparted by INFs is short lived and does not last forever. They are family of naturally occurring proteins that are made and secreted by all the cells (INF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b2) and lymphocytes (INF\u03b3). All these modulate the response of cells and immune system to viruses, bacteria, and cancer.Interferons are produced by either an established cell line (lymphoblastoid) or fresh cells isolated from blood. The production involves induction with virus and priming (incubation with some interferon) with interferon, resulting in better yield. The affi nity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies packed in the column has helped in purifi cation of interferons. But before the clinical usage, the removal or inactivation of virus is very important. The interferon therapy is used for cancers and viral infections (INF-\u03b1), multiple sclerosis (INF-\u03b2), and chronic granulomatous disease (INF-\u03b3). Multiferon is natural interferon-\u03b1, which consists of several subtypes. In some of the cancers like Merkel cell carcinoma, type I interferons (multiferon, which is a mix of various INF-\u03b1 subtypes and INF-\u03b2) are highly effective. In Chap. 11 , interferons are mentioned in protein therapeutics. Interferon is marketed as Roferon-A, Infergen, Intron A, and so on .",

The glycosylation is very important as it affects the activity, half-life, and immunogenicity of the recombinant protein.\u2022 Due to limitations, the other host systems were used for production which could give better product with minimal immune reactions and are cost-effective. Fungal and insect systems are utilized for protein production but sometimes result in inappropriate glycosylation. Improper glycosylation may result in nonfunctional and highly immunogenic protein.Mammalian cells are the most preferred system for production of these proteins. CHO system is the system of choice for therapeutic protein production. It accounts for nearly 70 % production of all products available in the market. ",
