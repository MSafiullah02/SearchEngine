These viruses evolve through genetic mutations and resulting antigenic changes, what allows them to evade host immunity. Influenza vaccines have to be updated periodically in order to be effective in the following season. Hence, the constant need for seasonal vaccination. As it takes approximately 6 months to produce influenza vaccines, recommendations need to be done in advance. The World Health Organization (WHO) convenes annual meetings in February and September each year to establish the composition of influenza vaccine for the forthcoming season in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively (Chambers et al. 2015; WHO 2014a; Webster et al. 2013).",
