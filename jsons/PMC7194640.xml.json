Globally, biodiversity is known to produce food and ensure nutritional security (Aerts et al., 2018, Stone et al., 2018, Jones, 2019), provide herbal medicines that cure diseases like cardiovascular, pulmonary, digestive, dermal and even dreaded cancer (Rai and Lalramnghinghlova, 2011, Aerts et al., 2018) and safeguard the environment/ecosystem services (\nKannan et al., 2016, Jones and McDermott, 2018\n). Phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles is another facet of biodiversity, which has recently revolutionized biomedical, sanitation, hygiene, food safety, environment, energy and agriculture sectors (Rai et al., 2018). These positive implications of biodiversity are essential for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).",

To this end, United Nation\u2019s (UN) Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) projected that about one fifth of the Earth\u2019s surface, including the global biodiversity hotspots, are at risk due to biotic invaders (IPBES, 2019). In this context, high income countries recorded 30 times greater numbers of IAPS, in comparison to the low income countries (Seebens et al., 2018). Therefore, IAPS hotspots are often confined to high income countries of European Union, Australasia and North America than Asia Pacific/African regions (Seebens et al., 2018, IPBES, 2019). This trend can be attributed to higher trade and transport activities in countries with high per capita income.",

Interestingly, it has been a matter of debate among invasion ecologists whether IAPS are the first/second-most severe threat (only 27.3% are in favour of this) or they should be ranked further below (Young and Larson, 2011). It is worth mentioning here, that these rankings in relation to biodiversity threats/extinctions may be region-specific. However, most common view among the invasion ecologists in this respect is that this global problem of IAPS is being accelerated by the anthropogenic perturbations (Young and Larson, 2011). Notably, in this respect Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services of UN, recently declared the IAPS/alien invaders as major driver of biodiversity loss (IPBES, 2019)",

Therefore, loss of native plant diversity through invasive plant pathogens may indirectly affect human health through perturbations in the environmental quality (Jones and McDermott, 2018). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that certain IAPS may act as ecological indicators of environmental pollution (Rai, 2016). For example, spread of a plant pathogen, the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), resulted in massive destruction of dominant ash trees in the United States (US), which otherwise acted as an effective sink for air pollutants (Jones and McDermott, 2018). Exposure to increased concentrations of hazardous air pollutants resulted in cardiovascular/pulmonary problems in human populations. Extreme pollution stress is reported to result in mortality and economic loss is reported (Jones and McDermott, 2018).",

In light of the above, the present paper reviews the progress made during the recent past on the ecological mechanisms of IAPS and their multi-faceted impacts on environmental/ecosystem services and human health. These issues are raised in an environmental management and human well-being perspective with the sustainability paradigm. Further, the quest of phyto-technological implications, associated with IAPS biomass management, further give an impetus to mitigating the associated human health hazards. Therefore, understanding the invasion ecology of such species is of paramount important for developing suitable management strategies.",

However, the majority of cited articles covered the recent progress in invasion science, but particularly from 2012 to 2019. Exhaustive literature survey was done to provide the readers an explicit and panoramic view of the IAPS biology. In this context, we used the search engine like SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar for the exhaustive literature survey. We collected 650 articles (covering academic/grey literatures) on multifaceted impacts of the IAPS on environment, economy and health. Since there is paucity of critical evaluation on the health impacts of IAPS, the articles covering bio-medical aspects were analysed in-depth. To this end, we used the key words \u201cPlant invasion human health OR well-being\u201d, \u201cInvasive alien plants health risks\u201d, \u201cAlien OR biotic invaders human health\u201d, \u201cInvasive alien plants health impact quantification\u201d in the said search engines. We varied the several IAPS terms as keywords e.g. \u201cinvasive\u201d, \u201cexotic\u201d, \u201calien\u201d, \u201cnon-native\u201d, and \u201cintroduced\u201d to widely address the state of the art in the plant invasion science. In this respect, we initially confined to the abstract of the articles and if found relevant to the theme, read thoroughly/critically and then extracted the scientific information, with citations in present review. To provide a concise, but explicit overview of the subject, other search terms included \u201cplant invasion economic impacts OR quantification\u2019, \u201cPlant invasion socio-economy OR livelihood impact\u201d, \u201cInvasive plants ecological OR bio indicators\u201d \u2018\u2018plant invasion management\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Role of remote sensing OR GIS in plant invasion mapping OR management\u2019\u2019. To study the IAPS interactions keywords comprised \u201cPlant invasion climate OR land-use change\u201d, \u201cPlant invasion habitat fragmentation OR destruction\u201d. In addition, we also accessed the important scientific databases available on the IAPS for extracting the useful information.

Nevertheless, \u2018invasive alien plant species (IAPS) are the alien species of plants, with efficient \u2018reproductive strategies (i.e. both vegetative and through seed) enabling them to sustain self-replacing populations, capable to produce offspring, even in the remote areas. IAPS can significantly affect the native plants of the invaded region, which are those species which have evolved in a particular area without the human intervention and thriving by natural means.",

The reason of success of the IAPS in diverse environments, is complex, and needs to be investigated in the context of specific IAPS. In this respect, species specific mechanisms for elucidating the spread of alien plants is necessary as they show differential invasive potential in tune with their ecosystem attributes (Ehrenfeld, 2008).",

Cinchona pubescens, known as the red quinine tree, is a model tree species in the treeless ecosystems of Gal\u00e1pagos highland, but recently it has been found to have turned invasive; thereby reducing the incoming solar radiation which affected the endemic herbaceous species more adversely than non-endemic native species (Ja\u00a8ger et al., 2009).",

For example, invasive plant pathogens such as emerald ash borer, which causes a massive devastation to ash trees in United States, the ash trees earlier acted as a sink to air pollutants (Jones and McDermott, 2018). The elevated levels of air pollutants can elevate regional losses in the tree diversity, which results in severe health implications, including mortality (Jones and McDermott, 2018). Losses of host plants are known to cause a spurt in the growth of pathogen population facilitating outbreak of several diseases like Tick-borne diseases, Tuberculosis (multidrug-resistant), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and virulent Malaria (Daszak et al., 2000, Pys\u02c7ek and Richardson, 2010, Hulme, 2014, Young et al., 2017, Stone et al., 2018). These severe human diseases and their sudden outbreak across continents are akin to biotic invasions themselves (Pys\u02c7ek and Richardson, 2010). Increase in pathogen population owing to host loss caused by either the land use change or global warming have led to emergence of new diseases like Dengue and Yellow fever by Aedes aegypti, Lyme disease, African horse sickness, Chikungunya fever, Nipah virus disease etc. (Daszak et al., 2000, Hulme, 2014, Young et al., 2017, Stone et al., 2018).",

In certain instances, the pathogenic IAPS (i.e. blight fungus i.e. Cryphonectria parasitica) completely eliminates the existing dominant native life forms (e.g., Castanea dentate or American chestnut in eastern deciduous forest of US) (Parker et al., 1999, Andersen et al., 2004). Further, a high risk plant invader Parthenium hysterophorus is demonstrated to spread phytoplasmas a vegetable pathogen, which is characterized by using molecular tools (16S rRNA and lineage-specific immune-dominant membrane protein genes).

Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) is also a high risk IAPS, helping in the spread of schistosomiasis (Mazza et al., 2014, Gezie et al., 2018, Stone et al., 2018). Likewise, another top ranked IAPS posing severe threats to the global environment and health is Arundo donax (Plaza et al., 2018). Trade of these aquatic plants facilitates the spread of disease causing vectors across the continents and increase the health risks from vector borne diseases (Mazza et al., 2014, Stone et al., 2018).",

Considerable future challenges in geospatial tools lie in the mapping of herbaceous IAPS and fragmented/sub-canopy distributions (Walsh, 2018). Further, the low temporal/spatial resolutions of multi/hyperspectral sensors with high cost are concern for the developing countries. For addressing this issue, efforts are on to advance the image classification algorithms (e.g. nonparametric) as well as vegetation/diversity indices (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI/beta diversity) for cost-effective efficient monitoring, mapping and modelling of IAPS (Royimani et al., 2018, Khare et al., 2019).",

Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS), an important assessment protocol, demonstrated 149 plants as worst invaders among the 486 investigated IAPS of Europe (Vila\u2018 et al., 2019). Scoring methods for the impact quantification cannot cover all impacts and further they mostly cover the local and regional aspects only (Ricciardi et al., 2013, Jeschke et al., 2014, Vil\u00e0 et al., 2019). Further limitation in protocol formulations has been demonstrated in occurrence of the cryptogenic/cryptic alien species (species with unclear place of origin). Moreover, the risk analysis of IAPS is still inadequate due to lack of data on ecological impacts, transparency/ repeatability and inclusion of uncertainty factor in the assessments (Vanderhoeven et al., 2017). Therefore, concrete impact assessment protocols (scoring methods) should be framed to quantify the environmental and socio-economic impacts of IAPS (Vila\u2018 et al., 2019) (Fig. 5).",

Nevertheless, UN-IPBES recently confirmed the biotic invaders as major drivers of biodiversity depletion. Anthropogenic disturbances are the prime factors responsible for biotic invasions. If such human mediated disturbances will be continued in the long term, there may be emergence of new IAPS, hazardous to environmental/human health. However with the explicit understanding of various mechanisms involved in arrival, spread and establishment of IAPS, we can sustainably manage the IAPS. In invasion ecology, more emphasis should be given on chemical ecology of native-IAPS interactions to elucidate the mechanisms of biodiversity loss. Emerging global issues, like biodiversity erosion, climate change, un-sustainable agriculture and environmental disturbances should be studied in depth to understand their complex interacting impacts on human health. Therefore, future researches should use multiple environmental stressors to address their impacts on environment/ecosystem services, socio-economic (livelihood), and human health.",

Indeed, the UN-IPBES- global indicators target i.e. 15.8, to achieve SDGs, intensively deals with the need of effective prevention and management strategies to control the IAPS by 2020.
