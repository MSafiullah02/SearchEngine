The work of deLemos and colleagues using the infant baboon model set the stage for human trials and found that HFOV, when compared to the conventional ventilation used at that time, resulted in less lung injury (deLemos et al. 1987, 1989; Meredith et al. 1989; Kinsella et al. 1991). By the early 1990\u2019s, there was a wealth of information from multiple investigators, using multiple animal models, suggesting that HFOV caused less injury to the immature lung than did \u201cconventional ventilation\u201d (Hamilton et al. 1983; Truog et al. 1984; McCulloch et al. 1988; Jackson et al. 1994). The generally accepted mechanism of this superiority was the ability to support gas exchange with small tidal volumes and high mean airway pressure, thereby minimizing injury from both overdistention and atelectasis.",

The physics of gas exchange with HFOV are complex and dealt with more fully elsewhere in this text. In brief, HFOV can be broadly described as enhanced mixing between gas in the upper airway and gas in the alveoli. While the mean airway pressure holds the lung open and promotes oxygenation, the oscillations essentially \u201cshake\u201d the gas, promoting rapid and efficient gas exchange. As HFOV amplitude is increased, there is increased shaking, which results in increased mixing and increased gas exchange.",

For example, at 1 Hz (60 breaths/min), essentially all of the pressure seen in the upper airway with each ventilator inflation is transmitted to the alveoli. However, at 10 Hz (600 breaths/min), there is significant attenuation of the amplitude signal by the airways. At 20 Hz, the attenuation is even more pronounced, causing even less of the amplitude pressure to be transmitted to the airway. Thus, changes in HFOV frequency have profound effects on the amount of pressure transmitted to the alveoli and on the efficacy of gas mixing.",

Aggressive recruitment of lung volume during HFOV is often achieved using higher mean airway pressures compared to conventional ventilation. A multicenter experience from different pediatric intensive care units in the United States demonstrated significant increases in mean airway pressure and concomitant increases in oxygenation index when patients were transitioned from conventional ventilation to HFOV (Arnold et al. 2000).

While neonates can breathe spontaneously during HFOV, the bias flow of the system is not sufficiently high to support spontaneous ventilation in pediatric patients (van Heerde et al. 2006). This effect was demonstrated in a study using an artificial lung device during HFOV. The work of breathing was considerably increased when an (simulated) adult or larger pediatric patient was breathing spontaneously during HFOV. During the simulation of a newborn breathing spontaneously, the work of breathing was markedly reduced (van Heerde et al. 2006). Outside the neonatal population, neuromuscular paralysis is required in patients to prevent depressurization of the circuit resulting in alveolar derecruitment (Heulitt et al. 2008; Wolf and Arnold 2007).",

The application of an aggressive recruitment strategy may increase the incidence of air trapping and the risk of extrapulmonary leak. However, infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections may present with both acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute lung injury and impaired CO2 elimination secondary to small airway obstruction. The successful use of HFOV in infants with RSV infection has been reported in a few cases, leading to reversal of hypoxemia and recruitment of atelectasis while achieving adequate CO2 removal (Berner et al. 2008). The use of HFOV in intubated children with status asthmaticus to facilitate CO2 removal has also been reported (Duval and van Vught 2000). However, utilizing HFOV to achieve adequate CO2 removal in this setting often requires the combination of a high amplitude and a low device frequency, resulting in increased delivered tidal volumes during HFOV. Since delivered tidal volumes are not measured during HFOV and may be as high as 5 ml/kg during clinical use (Sturtz et al. 2008), a high-amplitude low-frequency strategy may result in increased lung overdistention and may compromise the lung protective effects of HFOV (Wolf and Arnold 2008).",
