            "text": "The inhibition of viral enzymes plays an outstanding role in antiviral therapy, especially in cases where vaccines and vector control are not suffieciently robust. Recent progress in flaviviral vaccine development faces crucial challenges with unpredictable outcomes. Four dengue virus (DENV) where there are four serotypes, the serotype-related cross reactivity with human antibodies has been one of the main difficulties. DENV serotypes, are widely spread over the tropical and subtropical countries around the world and have become endemic in more than 100 countries within the last five decades. Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) during secondary infection after a previous infection with a different serotype can cause severe life-threatening symptoms, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. For this reason vaccines that simultaneously create pronounced immunity against all four serotypes are needed. Since late 2015, the first vaccine CYD (Dengvaxia), with significantly varying efficiency among the four dengue serotypes, has been approved in several countries. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the effect of cross reactivity is not limited to the four known dengue serotypes. Immunity to dengue can cause antibody-dependent enhancement of Zika virus infections and potentially increases viremia and severity of the disease [7, 13, 39]. Consequently, it cannot be ruled out that treatment with dengue vaccine may increase the chance of a later enhanced Zika virus infection. Due to such unexpected phenomena, the extensive search for effective antiviral drugs should be promoted in addition to vaccine development. One important approach aims to inhibit viral protease activity, as successfully demonstrated for chronic diseases such as hepatitis C or AIDS, where, among others, inhibitors of HCV and HIV proteases are established in modern combination therapy.",

            "text": "Due to limited druggability, all campaigns towards clinically relevant protease inhibitors for emerging flaviviruses have so far been unsuccessful. However, since the flaviviral proteases share a high degree of similarity in shape, substrate recognition and catalytic function, a successful drug development process may lead to pan-flaviviral protease inhibitors, which could be used against several globally challenging infectious diseases, such as dengue, West Nile or Zika. Therefore, the present chapter aims to briefly summarize the progress that has been made and tries to derive strategies for future attempts focusing on the protease. Within the last decade, a particular focus has been on the proteases of dengue and West Nile viruses. The highlights for these two most prominent examples will be discussed in this chapter. For a more comprehensive and detailed analysis regarding anti-infectives for these two viruses the interested reader is kindly referred to recent reviews [4, 27, 28, 33]. The chapter will also highlight recent campaigns for the identification of suitable inhibitors for Zika virus protease. Outcomes from all these attempts will inform general perspectives for a more efficient and hopefully successful search for drug-like protease inhibitors for flaviviruses.",

The polyprotein comprises three structural (C, prM, E) and eight non-structural (NS) proteins, which have to be released from the polyprotein after selective protease cleavage [9, 26, 33]. This essential posttranslational procession is executed by host and flaviviral proteases at the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum. The viral protease complex comprises a protease unit, located at the N-terminal part of NS3 and requires a hydrophilic core fragment of the membrane-associated protein NS2B as cofactor for catalytic activity. Highly conserved residues S135, His51 and Asp75 assemble the catalytic triad. The flaviviral serine NS2B-NS3 endoproteases show a common tendency to cleave peptidic backbones after two basic residues. However, detailed substrate preferences as well as catalytic efficiency vary among different flaviviruses.",

            "text": "Several crystal structures of dengue and West Nile proteases have been reported during the last decade. The main deviations are related to the role of the cofactor NS2B. Some structures reported NS2B to be disordered (referred as open or inactive form) whereas others resolved the cofactor domain wrapped around the active site of NS3 (referred as closed or active form). NMR studies indicate that, regardless of the presence or absence of ligands, the closed conformation is predominant [12, 47]. The importance of NS2B towards correct folding of the disordered NS3 domain has also been demonstrated [16]. Unfortunately, only a limited number of co-crystal structures with ligands or inhibitors are available (as a reliable basis for rational drug design). None of those comprise a small-molecular drug-like inhibitor. The first X-ray crystal structures of dengue and West Nile virus proteases became available in 2006 [14]. In case of West Nile virus this structure showed the catalytically active closed conformation with a substrate-derived tetrapeptidic aldehyde inhibitor covalently bound to Ser135 (pdb code: 2FP7). In case of dengue serotype 2 only an inactive open protease form without ligand could be crystallized (pdb code: 2FOM). Although inadequate, the latter structure was used as basis for several drug discovery campaigns until a closed and active form of dengue protease serotype 3 with the same tetrapeptidic aldehyde inhibitor became available in 2012 (pdb code: 3U1I) [37].",

            "text": "Recently, the first crystal structure of Zika virus protease in the active form with a boronate inhibitor, which suits a reasonable model for rational drug discovery campaigns, could be solved (pdb code: 5LC0) [25]. A second crystal structure without inhibitor revealed the open form (apo) of the enzyme with missing resolution for the C-terminal part of NS2B (pdb code: 5GXJ) [11]. A significantly divergent conformation was also obtained for an NS3 loop region between residues 152 and 167, which contributes to the S1 shape. The obvious deviations between these initial crystal structures suggested a conformational activation upon substrate or inhibitor binding. Additional crystallographic and in-solution experiments were necessary to analyse these results in more detail. Since, several new crystal structures and NMR studies in presence and absence of ligands, covering \u2018pre-open\u2019 (pdb code: 5T1V), open and closed conformations have been reported [24, 30, 38, 56]. They discovered, in contrast to previous studies with dengue and West Nile protease, a more delicate dependence of open and closed conformations from the construct that was used to fuse NS2B and NS3. The artificial covalently linked construct gZiPro only adopts the closed conformation in presence of substrate-like ligands, but can also bind inhibitors in the open conformation [30]. A construct with an autocleavage site between NS2B and NS3 (eZiPro) showed the closed conformation in the crystal structure (pdb code: 5GJ4), but NMR relaxation data indicated high mobility of NS2B in solution [38]. Apparently, a C-terminal tetrapeptide of NS2B that was found to occupy the active site could not maintain the closed state in solution. A construct without covalent linkage (bZiPro) displayed the closed conformation in solution and in the single crystal (pdb code: 5GPI) [56]. This construct could even be used to capture the structure of a fragment hit in the closed state after being soaked into the crystal (pdb code: 5H4I) [56]. Consequently, bZiPro represents the most suitable construct for compound screening in addition to gZiPro, which may be superior to identify compounds that are able to bind to the open conformation or supposedly perturb the interaction between NS2B and NS3.",

Compound 2 was identified from a computational screening approach [20] with a K\ni value of 2.0 \u03bcM (serotype 2). Guanidine groups are crucial for sufficient activity, indicating a likely electrostatic interaction with residues in the S1 or S2 pocket of the protease. A covalent interaction of the activated ester bond with Ser135 is possibly, but has not yet been confirmed experimentally. Compound 3 is supposedly an allosteric inhibitor, identified from a virtual screening of compounds, actually aiming at West Nile virus protease, which may inhibit the interactions between NS3 and NS2B [42]. It shows an IC50 value of 2.0 \u03bcM, some basic antiviral activity in cells and limited cytotoxicity. A structurally similar but larger derivative 10 (Fig. 13.2) identified from the same campaign showed only slightly lower affinity (IC50 = 2.8 \u03bcM), but improved cellular data (EC50 = 40 \u03bcM).

Compound 13 (K\ni = 9.5 \u03bcM) is an example of a series of lead compounds that have been recycled from an HCV protease high-throughput screening campaign [24]. The dopamine antagonist bromocriptine (14), which has previously been reported to inhibit viral replication for all four dengue serotypes [19], also reduces Zika virus replication in cell culture [8]. In contrast to dengue, the Zika virus protease could be confirmed as potential target of bromocriptine (IC50 = 21.6 \u03bcM). Compound 15, which was previously reported to be active against West Nile (IC50 = 0.74 \u03bcM) but inactive against dengue protease (at concentrations lower than 10 \u03bcM), was found to be also a promising Zika protease inhibitor (IC50 = 0.82 \u03bcM), especially from the perspective of ligand efficiency (molecular weight = 190 Da). It inhibited viral replication in cell culture (EC50 ~ 50 \u03bcM) and could reduce the level of circulating Zika viruses in mice [43]. Although these data are promising, apart from docking studies, which suggest binding close to the active site and interference with NS2B, structural data that would facilitate a hit-to-lead campaign are missing (Fig. 13.3).",

They often cannot be considered as drug-like leads due to their unsuitable pharmacokinetic and physiochemical properties, such as bioavailability, specificity and plasma stability. Notably, these peptides could reach higher affinity towards West Nile than dengue virus protease. For oligo-d-arginines affinities up to 1 nM have been reported in case of West Nile virus [44]. Peptidomimetics with N-terminal dichloro-substituted phenylacetyl groups and C-terminal arginine mimetics reached IC50 values of up to 0.12 \u03bcM [17].

These compounds may not only offer a route towards more drug-like small-molecular derivatives, they have also become valuable tools in structural biology to elucidate inhibitor-protease interactions, which will hopefully illuminate the way towards a more structure-based drug design. Although, the drug-likeness of this compound class is limited, a significant reduction of viral titers for West Nile and dengue viruses in cell culture could be observed. Compound 16 showed pronounced pan-flaviviral protease affinity with K\ni values of 51, 82 and 40 nM for dengue, West Nile and Zika virus proteases, respectively. This derivative was co-crystalized with the proteases of Zika [25] and West Nile [36] viruses. Derivative 17 was used to demonstrate a novel NMR-based approach to identify the binding mode of tightly binding inhibitor molecules towards dengue virus protease from sertotype 2 [10]. The tert-butyl moiety in 17 appears as a sharp and isolated signal in proton NMR spectra. Using the power of paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy [34] combined with NOEs, the positions of the tert-butyl group and aromatic protons in close proximity could be predicted in relation to the 3D structure of the protein. Very recently, compounds 16 and 17 have been used to study the conformational flexibility of the NS2B cofactor of Zika protease in solution [30] (Fig. 13.4).",

The optimization focused so far only on enzymatic inhibition in biochemical assays, limiting the drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties of this compound class. However, with a K\ni value of 12 nM, 18 is the compound of highest affinity towards dengue serotype 2 protease reported so far [3]. It also shows remarkable affinity against West Nile virus protease with a K\ni of 39 nM. Due to limited permeability, the antiviral cellular activity is only moderate with EC50 values of 20 and 23 \u03bcM for dengue and West Nile viruses, respectively. Recently, the highly related derivative 19 was analysed against Zika protease [23]. It showed reduced inhibition potential for Zika (IC50 = 1.0 \u03bcM) compared to previous reported results for dengue (IC50 = 0.028 \u03bcM) and West Nile proteases (IC50 = 0.12 \u03bcM) [3, 23]. Increased cellular activity was found for analogue 20 with slightly improved permeability (dengue: EC50 = 3.4 \u03bcM; West Nile: EC50 = 15.6 \u03bcM) [3]. However, the affinity of 20 towards the proteases dropped significantly compared to 18 or 19 with IC50 values of 176 and 557 nM for dengue and West Nile proteases, respectively. Structural evidences, such as NMR or crystallographic data, for the binding mode of this compound class are unfortunately missing. This information would be very valuable to rationalize the pronounced SAR.",

In contrast to other flaviviral proteases, such as those from dengue or West Nile viruses, Zika comprises a negatively charged aspartate residue in position 83 of the cofactor domain NS2B. The West Nile protease contains a structurally very similar, although uncharged, asparagine residue in that position. Dengue protease serotypes have either a serine or threonine in that position. Without any structural information this situation may not have led to any special attention for drug development purposes with Zika virus protease. However, from the crystal structure it turned out that this NS2B aspartate residue is responsible for a salt-bridge formation with the aminomethyl-phenyl moiety (P2) of compound 16 leading to an extra tight binding of inhibitors and substrates. As the possibilities for tight interactions of inhibitors with flaviviral proteases are usually limited, this information is highly relevant for further drug design campaigns.",
