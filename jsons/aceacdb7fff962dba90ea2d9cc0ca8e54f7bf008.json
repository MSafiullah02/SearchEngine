            "text": "The authors state that the stimulus to produce this book was the repeated demandsof medical students and houseofficers for a concise practical text listing methods of diagnosis and management of main general surgical conditions. The authors have provided them with a review of twelve major areas of challenge in generalsurgery. Rapid reference is possible byutilizing the Contents at the beginning ofthe book and the briefoutlineat the beginning ofeach subchapter. Although deficiencies can be identified, this outline from a major medical center in England can be a valuable reference source for any student/house officer in surgical training. This book is written for students, technologists, and physicians who wish to learn more about coagulation through evaluation of individual patients with disorders of hemostasis. The book is divided into two parts. In the first part the author reviews in four chapters the biochemistry of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, the roles of platelets and endothelial cellsin coagulation, and the clinical and laboratoryapproach to bleeding disorders. The second part is comprised of sixty-two case histories that are organized under the categories of hereditary and acquired disorders of coagulation proteinsand physiologic inhibitors, hereditary and acquired disorders of platelets, and complications associated with anticoagulant therapy. The indexprovides a quickgutde to specific examples of each coagulation disorder. Many topics are covered in a somewhat superficial fashion; however numerous texts are available to provide detailed information about specific areas of interest. The book is an excellent gUide for instructors and for those whowish to learn more about a practical approach to disorders of hemostasis. This'is a briefand valuable text for all patient care providers who work in an emergency care setting. It provides a basic approach to the promptdiagnosis of the traumatized patient byimaging methods. The bookrelies heavily on illustrations with a minimum of text. The entire book can be read in three to four hours. It is organized by body area (skull, spine,shoulder, etc.) to provide quickand readyreference. Each chapter begins with illustrations and a brief discussion of standard radiographic views. The usefulness of each projection is described and pertinent normalanatomyis clearly labeled. Common injuries are reviewed and illustrated with radiographs. Both plain ftlm radiographs and computed tomography images are demonstrated. Tables provide valuable summaries of clinical information for easy reference, Algorithms give guldeltnes for efficient utilization of imaging methods for prompt diagnosis of common trauma problems. The real strengths of this book are its clinical usefulness, clear illustrations, and its brevity. I highly recommend this book as a study gutde for all emergency care providers and as a reference text for emergency rooms.",

After 12 chapters on the basic principles and methods of epidemiology, and organization of community investigations (Section A), the following six sectionsdiscuss airborne, food and waterborne infections, direct contact infections (24 sexually transmitted dis-Military Medicine, Vol. 151,September 1986 eases, including AIDS), vector-borne infections, zoonoses, and noninfectious illnesses (e.g., malnutrition, malignant disease, accidents, etc.). The last section (Sect. H) is devoted to problems of population dynamics, childgrowth, and health services to nomadic people. The work is provided with a verydetailed alphabetical index. This publicationis well-written, easy to read,and its spirit is trulyaccording to the slogan of the World Health Organization: In recent years, considerable biomedical and biological literature has been accumulated documenting significant advancements in knowledge pertainingto animals that cause human disease or serve as vectors of organisms that cause diseasein man. This newedition, somewhat smaller than previous ones, fills the need for an updated and revised textbook which successfully presents succinct new information on parasitesand parasiticdiseasesofman. Itscontributors haveaccomplished this task without restrictingcoverage or omitting importantdetails. This book was revised bynine authoritative health scientists whocovered subjectsrepresenting their specializations or chief interests. The information contained in it is essential to physicians, epidemiologists, sanitarians, entomologists, parasitologists, protozoologists, veterinarians, biologists, and others whowork in the areas of causation, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and control of various protozoa and protozoan infections, helminths and helminthic infections, and arthropods as agents and vectors of human disease. The book includes a chapter on general principles of host, parasite, and community which is followed by other chapters that are organized taxonomically. One portion of the text addresses aids to diagnosis and treatment, covering such topics as materials and methods, immunologic diagnosis, and treatment for parasitic diseases. The authors have given the scientific community a valuable, concise, and well-written reference that will be an asset to human and veterinary military medicine worldwide. ",
