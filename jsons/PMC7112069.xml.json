            "text": "The order Nidovirales comprises enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The Nidovirales order includes the Coronaviridae family that contains viruses with the largest known RNA genome, of around 30 Kb (Enjuanes et al., 2008). Coronavirus (CoVs) infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species. The development of efficient CoV reverse genetics systems (Almazan et al., 2006, Almazan et al., 2013, Almazan et al., 2000, Almazan et al., 2014, Casais et al., 2001, Thiel et al., 2001, Yount et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2002) makes them promising expression vectors, with several advantages over other viral expression systems. CoVs replicate in the cytoplasm without a DNA intermediary, making integration of the virus genome into the host cell chromosome unlikely (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). In addition, these viruses have the largest RNA virus genome and, in principle, have room for the insertion of large foreign genes (Enjuanes et al., 2005, Masters, 1999). As CoVs in general infect both respiratory and enteric mucosal surfaces, they may be used to target the antigen to these areas, stimulating the mucosal immune system to induce a pleiotropic secretory immune response, including lactogenic immunity (Sola et al., 2003). In fact, it has been described that a pleiotropic secretory immune response is best induced by the stimulation of gut associated lymphoid tissues (Saif, 1996). Moreover, the tropism of CoVs may be engineered by modifying the spike (S) gene (Casais et al., 2003, Sanchez et al., 1999), and non-pathogenic CoV strains infecting most species of interest (human, porcine, bovine, canine, feline, and avian) are available and therefore are suitable to develop safe virus vectors (Cavanagh et al., 2007, Ortego et al., 2002).",

Foreign gene expression levels can be regulated by the use of different transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) ranging from intermediate to high gene expression levels (Alonso et al., 2002a). In addition, our group has recently identified an optimized transcription-regulating motif, enhancing by 5-fold the mRNA levels of a viral gene, which can be used in expression vectors based in CoV genomes (Mateos-Gomez et al., 2011). Additionally, a combination of these TRSs could be used to drive the expression of two or three heterologous genes from just one infectious cDNA (i.e., dicistronic or tricistronic vectors).",

In general, the stability of heterologous genes is high for DNA viruses and negative RNA viruses, in which the low level of recombination contributes to the maintenance of the inserted foreign genes (Bukreyev et al., 2006) In contrast, positive RNA viruses are highly prone to recombination, both homologous and non-homologous (Alejska et al., 2005, Figlerowicz et al., 2003) leading to the loss of the inserted genes and avoiding their expression over a long time period. CoVs are positive RNA genomes with high recombination frequency (Denison et al., 2011, Lai, 1996, Sanchez et al., 1992). Genetic instability leading to the loss of heterologous genes has been frequently reported in CoV-derived vectors, both in vitro (Bentley et al., 2013, Cruz et al., 2010, Sola et al., 2003) and in vivo (Bentley et al., 2013).",

TGEV-derived vectors have been successfully engineered for the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFP gene was expressed by replacing the non-essential genes 3a and 3b, leading to very stable (>20 passages in tissue culture) high expression levels of the heterologous protein (50 \u03bcg/106cells) (Sola et al., 2003). Recombinant TGEV (rTGEV) vectors have been engineered for dicistronic expression of heterologous genes, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) GP5 and M proteins (Cruz et al., 2010), or rotavirus VP2 and VP6, in which formation of rotavirus virus like particles (VLPs) in the cytoplasm of rTGEV infected cells was observed (Enjuanes et al., 2007).",

PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus of approximately 15 Kb in length that contains 9 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replicase non-structural proteins, while ORFs 2 to 7 encode structural proteins: the small envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and the glycoproteins GP2a, GP3, GP4, GP5, and the recently identified protein 5a (Dokland, 2010, Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011).

The modest results obtained may be due to the instability of GP5 protein in the rTGEV system, resulting in a significant loss of GP5 expression in 8\u201310 passages in tissue culture. Expression of full-length PRRSV GP3 or GP4 proteins was also toxic for rTGEV leading to the loss of the heterologous gene sequence (M. Becares, S. Zu\u00f1iga and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). In this work the stability of the expression of small domains of PRRSV GP3, GP4 and GP5, previously described as potentially relevant in the induction of protection against PRRSV has been studied, in comparison with the expression of full-length proteins, using rTGEV vectors. Our results showed that reduction of the heterologous genes size inserted in the CoV-derived vector is a promising strategy to achieve stable expression. Additionally, as PRRSV M protein was stable in rTGEV, several antigenic structures were engineered using this protein as scaffold for the expression of small antigenic domains, resulting in high stability. Furthermore, immunization of piglets with these live attenuated rTGEV vectors partially protected against PRRSV, with reduction of clinical signs and lung damage as well as a faster viremia decrease.",

As a consequence, we decided to evaluate the expression of small domains containing epitopes potentially relevant in protection, as the reduction of potential toxic domains could increase vector stability.",

            "text": "In a first approach, a rTGEV co-expressing GP5 ectodomain (GP5ecto) and M protein was engineered. GP5ecto transcription was driven by the TRS3a, and that of M protein by an optimized TRS partially derived from gene N TRS (TRS22N) (Alonso et al., 2002a). M protein was included in the rTGEV construct because it was fully stable and we previously observed that it increased GP5 stability, probably by forming the heterodimer observed in the native virus (Cruz et al., 2010). In fact, we postulate that the expressed GP5 domains and M protein could form a heterodimer similar to the one observed in the virus, what may be important for its immunogenicity. GP5ecto consisted in the 68 most N-terminal amino acids of the Olot91 GP5 protein, which according to bioinformatics predictions cover the ectodomain of the protein. This domain included the protein motifs relevant in protection, such as the immunodominant epitope and the epitope critical in neutralization as well as the glycosylation sites (\nFig. 2A). To allow GP5ecto protein detection, a hemaglutinin (HA) tag was fused to GP5 protein domain (Fig. 2A). This tag is small (9 amino acids) and was previously used for CoV protein tagging, without showing any toxicity (Alvarez et al., 2010). rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP5ecto-TRS22N-M was recovered with titers similar to those of wt virus. The stability of GP5ecto domain with virus passages was analyzed by RT-PCR analysis of isolated clones. After 8 passages in tissue culture, 80% of the isolated clones contained the GP5ecto sequence (Fig. 2B) and expressed the corresponding mRNA (data not shown), representing a modest increase of stability compared with GP5 full-length (60% stable) (Fig. 2B). Unfortunately, in both cases, the heterologous GP5 sequences were lost at passage 16 (data not shown), indicating that GP5ecto long-term stability did not represent a sufficient improvement as compared to full-length GP5. Similar conclusions were extracted from immunofluorescence analysis of protein expression (data not shown).",

The resulting 34 amino acid fragment of GP5 protein (GP5fr) was inserted in rTGEV, leading to rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP5fr-TRS22N-M virus. This small domain contained the GP5 epitope critical in neutralization, glycosylation sites and the cysteine residue involved in the GP5-M heterodimer formation. For GP5fr detection a FLAG tag was fused at the carboxi-terminus (Fig. 2A). This FLAG tag has been successfully used in CoV protein tagging (Alvarez et al., 2010). The additional size reduction of the GP5 fragment cloned in rTGEV led to an improvement in heterologous gene stability after 8 passages in tissue culture, with 90% of the independent clones containing GP5fr sequence (Fig. 2B) and expressing GP5fr mRNA (data not shown). Moreover, long-term stability was significantly improved, with up to 50% of the isolated clones stably maintaining GP5fr after 16 passages in tissue culture (data not shown).",

None of those proteins was stably expressed by rTGEV vectors, with PRRSV GP3 protein resulting extremely toxic for rTGEV system, leading to its expression loss in early stages (M. Becares, S. Zu\u00f1iga and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). The recent identification of antigenic, linear domains in GP3 and GP4 (Costers et al., 2010, Vanhee et al., 2011) allowed the application of the small domain expression strategy to these proteins. Fusion domains including GP3 or GP4 epitopes critical in neutralization, flanked by a few amino acids (Table 1), and preceded by the corresponding signal peptide were designed. These peptidic domains consisting of 55 and 50 amino acids of GP3 (GP3fr) and GP4 (GP4fr), respectively, were fused to the FLAG tag at their C terminus end (\nFig. 3A). The GP3 and GP4 fragments were cloned in TGEV genome in the location previously occupied by non-essential genes 3a and 3b and their transcription was driven by the TRS3a. Recombinant viruses rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP3fr and rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP4fr were recovered with titers similar to those of the wt virus. The stability of the recombinant viruses was analyzed after 8 and 16 passages in tissue culture, by studying 10 plaque-purified clones by RT-PCR. All the clones maintained the heterologous gene sequence, and expressed the corresponding mRNA (Fig. 3B), indicating that both GP3fr and GP4fr were fully stable in the rTGEV vector. Protein detection using anti-FLAG antibody failed for GP3fr, GP4fr and GP5fr, both in immunofluorescence and Western blot assays (data not shown).",

Our results indicated that M protein was fully stable in rTGEV (see above). Therefore, we postulated that M protein could be used as a scaffold for the expression of small antigenic domains. As a proof of principle, the GP3 epitope critical in neutralization (ECN) domain was selected for expression fused to M protein. Two exposed locations into M protein were predicted using TMpred transmembrane topology prediction algorithm (Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993): the N-terminus and a loop comprising amino acids 63 to 70. GP3 ECN was inserted at these M protein locations, leading to chimeric structures, GP3ep-NtermM and GP3ep-Mloop, respectively (\nFig. 4A). These chimeric genes were cloned into rTGEV vector, and recombinant viruses rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP3ep-NtermM and rTGEV-S7.1-TRS3a-GP3ep-Mloop were rescued with titers similar to those of the parental virus.

The expression of small protein domains was used as a strategy to improve heterologous gene stability. Stable expression of protein antigenic domains contained in highly unstable full-length proteins was achieved. Additionally, as full-length PRRSV M protein was stably expressed by rTGEV, it was used as a scaffold for the generation of chimeric proteins that exposed other PRRSV antigens, resulting in highly stable expression. Therefore, size reduction of the heterologous genes inserted in CoV-derived vectors resulted in a promising strategy to achieve stable expression.

In addition, other factors affect genetic stability of recombinant CoVs, such as the insert size (de Haan et al., 2005), and the genomic location in which it is inserted (Bentley et al., 2013). The maintenance of the inserted genes will also depend on the recombination rate, conditioned both by the insert size and the presence in the foreign sequence of regions showing homology with the virus genome, favoring homologous recombination (Wang et al., 2003). Furthermore, other heterologous gene or protein characteristics may affect insert stability, leading to loss of the inserts harmful for the infected cell or virus replication. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the specific insert stability in advance, before a highly effort-consuming process to generate the CoV-derived vectors expressing the heterologous antigen has been accomplished.",

Nevertheless, M protein was fully stable in rTGEV vectors, while GP5 protein resulted toxic and its expression was lost after 4\u20135 passages of the virus in cell culture. Interestingly, PRRSV hydrophobic M protein resulted highly toxic in other expression systems, including bacteria and insect cells (Jeong et al., 2010, Plana-Dur\u00e1n et al., 1997). As deletion of the heterologous genes could be due to homologous recombination between the heterologous gene and TGEV genome because of sequence identity, this possibility was analyzed. No statistically significant sequence identity was identified between PRRSV GP5 sequence and TGEV genome. In fact, analysis of the deletions observed in the unstable recovered viral clones did not show a common pattern of recombination. In constrast, random deletions were observed ranging from small deletions affecting TRS, to larger ones covering most PRRSV GP5 gene sequence (data not shown), that in all cases led to the loss of protein expression. Additionally, the GP5 gene, when expressed alone in rTGEV vectors, was lost at very early passages while it was stably maintained until passage 8 when it was co-expressed with M protein, most likely due to the formation of GP5-M heterodimers (Cruz et al., 2010). These data suggested that the instability was caused by protein toxicity affecting host cell viability or viral life cycle, rather than a negative effect of the heterologous gene sequences on virus genomic stability. This toxicity would confer selective advantage to those viral clones that did not express GP5 protein.",

Therefore, heterologous gene size reduction is a promising strategy to achieve stable expression in TGEV-derived vectors and in general in CoVs. This effect could be due to a decrease of the probability of non-homologous recombination in shorter sequences, or to the elimination of protein domains toxically affecting the host cell or rTGEV life cycle. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that gene size affected foreign gene stability in CoV vectors, as the larger firefly luciferase gene resulted less stable than the shorter Renilla luciferase gene, when expressed by Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus (FIPV) vectors (de Haan et al., 2005).",

To this end, a detailed analysis of CoV proteins involved in genetic recombination is needed. Several enzymes involved in CoV RNA synthesis, such as nsp13 (helicase), nsp15 (endonuclease), nsp14 (exonuclease), nsp7 and nsp8 (RNA processivity components), or N protein could modulate recombination in CoVs. The engineering of recombination defective CoV mutants by knocking-down one or several genes involved in the recombination process could be the first step to achieve stable expression of large heterologous genes.",

Neutralizing antibodies seem relevant for preventing PRRSV infection (Lopez and Osorio, 2004), but not enough to provide full protection (Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011). T-cell responses seem also required in PRRSV clearance (Mateu and Diaz, 2008). In the present study, immunized animals showed a significant faster recall antibody response against GP5 protein, which is generally considered the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Kim and Yoon, 2008, Ostrowski et al., 2002). Non-immunized animals developed a higher neutralizing response after challenge with a virulent PRRSV strain, what is considered as an indication of higher infection, whereas the immunized animals were significantly, although partially, protected against PRRSV infection. With the available data, it is not possible to determine whether the observed protection was due to an undetectable neutralizing antibody response before challenge [even commercial available vaccines have been reported to fail in the induction of detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies before challenge (Geldhof et al., 2012)] to immune cell responses [most likely directed to M protein present in the immunization cocktail], or both. The higher GP5 protein specific antibody response was observed from day 10 post-challenge, while significant differences in neutralizing antibodies between immunized and non-immunized animals were observed between 21 and 28 days post-challenge, correlating with the differences in viremia, what suggests that the observed neutralizing response was due to a higher infection of non-immunized swine. The relative contribution to protection of the humoral and cellular responses has not been determined. When a correlation between protection and induction of specific cytokines was analyzed, IL-8 levels were significantly different between immunized and non-immunized piglets, with levels consistently higher in non-immunized animals. The exacerbated IL-8 response elicited in non-immunized animals correlated with the higher lung damage observed in these animals. This result was in agreement with previous studies showing that piglets with more severe symptoms, including viremia and lung lesions, had a continuous elevation of IL-8 in serum, while in animals with milder symptoms IL-8 levels returned to normal by 7 dpi (Petry et al., 2007). Higher, but not significant, levels of IFN-\u03b1 were also observed in immunized animals compared to non-immunized animals (data not shown), at day 3 post-PRRSV challenge. This result suggested that immunized animals developed a higher innate immune response, which nevertheless did not seem strong enough to induce a higher adaptative immune response.",
