The increasing safety of surgery over that long timescale was undoubtedly attributable to improvements in anaesthesia, in antisepsis, in surgical techniques, and in perioperative care. In contrast, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by prescribed medicines now account for a significant proportion of hospital admissions,2 and, in one study, they accounted for ~3% of hospital deaths.3 The scope of the histopathology of ADRs and other iatrogenic conditions is too diverse to be summarized here. Suffice to say that, when ADRs result in morphological changes, they are often diagnostically challenging. Mimicry of naturally occurring diseases is common, and the iatrogenic nature of the problem may become evident only from subtle histological features or from the clinical circumstances.",
