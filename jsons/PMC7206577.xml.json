Lack of food security, or food insecurity, exists \u2018whenever the availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or the ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways is limited or uncertain\u2019 [17]. Central to the concept of food insecurity is the focus on uncertain or inadequate food access due to limited financial resources [18]. As such, any events that impact one\u2019s ability to acquire financial resources may, potentially, increase their risk of experiencing food insecurity.\u201cEverything we know about household food insecurity in Canada suggests that without effective responses to the hardships brought on by COVID-19, food insecurity will increase in prevalence and severity, and the health implications of being food insecure will become even more dire.\u201d- Dr. Valerie Tarasuk (PROOF\u2014Food Insecurity Policy Research, Canada) [19]",

Therefore, as a result of the deprivation that underlies the experience of food insecurity, it is a public health issue [22] and a matter for social action [21, 23]. In terms of the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on food insecurity, there have been recent news reports, in both Canada [24] and the United States [25], highlighting dramatic increases in food bank usage. Acknowledging that food banks are, in fact, limited in their capacity to address the root causes of food insecurity [26, 27], their utility in acting as a \u2018canary in a coal mine\u2019 [28] should serve as a warning sign for us all.",

Numerous studies have been completed in a variety of settings, providing food insecurity prevalence estimates as well as descriptions of consequences of food insecurity [29]. From this work, it is understood that there are consistently high prevalences of food insecurity, particularly severe food insecurity, among PLWH [30\u201332]. Importantly, food insecurity prevalence estimates among PLWH are, almost universally, higher than those found in comparable general population samples [33\u201335]. Although comparability is limited by differences in the tools used to measure food insecurity [36], the overwhelming occurrence of this experience among PLWH has resulted in researchers describing the HIV-food insecurity relationship as a \u2018vicious cycle\u2019 that must be addressed [30\u201332].",

Therefore, while the experience of food insecurity is a cause for concern regardless of the setting [34, 35], there are, indeed, HIV-specific implications to consider [32]. Subsequently, intending to inform interventions to reduce food insecurity among PLWH, several studies have also examined risk factors for this experience [29]. In addition to behavioural and clinical factors, such as illicit substance use [40, 41] and depressive symptoms [41, 42] (both of which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic [6]), socioeconomic factors, such as low income and unemployment, are consistently identified as important risk factors for food insecurity among PLWH [41\u201343].",

In other words, if the goal of risk factor epidemiology is to identify unbiased associations, or causes of outcomes, and to intervene on such causes [46], the provision of food does not necessarily act on these determinants (e.g., illicit substance use, depressive symptoms, low income, unemployment [40\u201343]). While we certainly do not discourage the provision of food as a form of harm reduction [47], the historic policy actions being taken, in response to COVID-19, may provide an opportunity to better understand potential solutions to food insecurity.",

Treating the implementation of the policy as a \u2018natural experiment\u2019 [49], it was found that a relatively small monthly income supplement led to reductions in food insecurity, with larger reductions in vulnerable sub-groups. A more recent study [50], using the same difference-in-differences methodology, examined a similar policy; severe food insecurity declined among Canadian families who received the income supplement. Other food insecurity-related publications have evaluated similar interventions [51\u201353], further contributing to the expanding evidence-base in this area.",

This taxable benefit provides $2000 per month, for up to 4 months, to Canadian\u2019s suffering losses of income during the pandemic. Around the same time, the White House unveiled a two-trillion-dollar relief package within their \u2018Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES)\u2019 Act [55]. While these are limited examples from two North American countries, they serve to highlight an opportunity for researchers to carefully unpack these policies, and others like them, to determine if their impacts on food insecurity can be evaluated. It is important to note, however, that several assumptions are necessary when attempting to quantify the effects of policies (e.g., the parallel trends assumption when using the difference-in-differences method) [56, 57]. As such, findings should be presented alongside sensitivity analyses and robustness checks [56].",

As indicated by reports of increasing food bank usage [24, 25], it is reasonable to suggest that food insecurity among PLWH, along with its consequences (i.e., lower CD4 cell counts [37], incomplete HIV viral load suppression [38], and sub-optimal HIV treatment adherence [39]), may become more common. While decision makers, PLWH, and their caregivers need to acknowledge this potential reality, it may also be an opportunity for HIV researchers to study the impacts of COVID-19-related policy implementations on food insecurity.",
