The paper facilitates a positivistic epistemology based on the scientific method for objectivity and precision. Hence, the study provides an original contribution to the scientific body of knowledge in the broad domains of MCL and m-learning.

Married students have also found WhatsApp disruptive because its use collided with their family time [18]. In contrast, there is research indicating that students have found learning on WhatsApp interesting, convenient and motivating [21].

In addition, it is a fairly recent publication and has been cited by 1793 according to Google Scholar as of 22 December 2019. The framework provides a 10-step procedure for instrument development starting with construct conceptualization or reconceptualization and ending in the development of norms [26]. Nonetheless, since the scope of the study was limited to the important conceptual steps only, the first four conceptual steps of the framework were applied.",

Thus, only a general relationship is specified between all those constructs and C. Also, the relationship from C to AA is specified since it is the central focus of the study. These relationships can be specified as the following alternate hypotheses (HA1-n): IA positively influences C, S positively influences C, IE positively influences C, SC positively influences C, ID positively influences C, T positively influences C, AL positively influences C, F negatively or positively influences C and C positively influences AA. The corresponding null hypotheses (H01-n) specify that there are no associations among each set of constructs.",
