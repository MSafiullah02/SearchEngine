            "text": "Murine norovirus (MNV), a member of the genus Norovirus in the family Caliciviridae, is a non-enveloped virus with positive sense single-stranded genomic RNA. The virus MNV-1 was the first strain discovered in severely immunocompromised RAG2/STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Karst et al., 2003). To date, many strains of MNV have been isolated from laboratory mouse colonies (Hsu et al., 2006, M\u00fcller et al., 2007, Thackray et al., 2007, Barron et al., 2011, Smith et al., 2012). In North America, 22.1% of 12,639 mouse sera were positive for anti-MNV-1 antibodies (Hsu et al., 2005). The high prevalence of MNV in laboratory mice was also confirmed by serological survey in Europe and Japan (Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009, Kitagawa et al., 2010). Currently, MNV is recognized as the most common contaminant in laboratory mice, and thought to be prevalent in mouse colonies worldwide. Biological diversity among MNV strains has also been reported. Clone CW3 of MNV-1 was rapidly cleared in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, while C57BL/6 mice were infected persistently with MNV-CR1, MNV-CR3, MNV-CR6, MNV-CR7, and MNV-WU11 (Thackray et al., 2007).",

However, the effects of MNV infection on biomedical research are still unclear. MNV-CR6 infection had no significant effect on the immune response to vaccinia virus and influenza A virus infection (Hensley et al., 2009). MNV-4 infection did not affect bacteria-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Smad3\u2212/\u2212 mice, although the infection accelerated IBD progression in Mdr1a\u2212/\u2212 mice (Lencioni et al., 2011). MNV-1 inhibited CD8 T cell responses to immunodominant murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) epitopes in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. However, MNV-1 did not affect MCMV titers in either mouse strain (Doom et al., 2009). Atg16L1HM mice infected with MNV-CR6 exhibited multiple hallmarks of human Crohn's disease after dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration as opposed to mice infected with MNV-1.CW3 (Cadwell et al., 2010). Since MNV infection may interfere in experiments and the data analysis, the use of MNV-free laboratory mice is appropriate for biomedical research.",

However, they are time-consuming, laborious and inconvenient. Real-time RT-PCR is a simple, rapid and sensitive technique compared to end-point RT-PCR (Baert et al., 2008, Belliot et al., 2008, Kitajima et al., 2010). In spite of that, the requirement for an expensive and sophisticated instrument and the higher running costs prevent its use becoming popular.",

Additionally, one or two loop primers (LF and/or LB) are also designed to accelerate the LAMP reaction (Nagamine et al., 2002). The intricate primer set can be designed automatically using online primer design software programs such as PrimerExplore (Fujitsu Limited). However, the programs have difficulty in designing a set of broadly reactive LAMP primers for an RNA virus consisting of many variants. To solve this problem, multiple sets of LAMP primers have been used to detect RNA viruses (Fukuda et al., 2006, Dinh et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2011). In this study, a set of LAMP primers with the potential to detect MNV isolates that have been reported worldwide were designed manually, and the broad reactivity and sensitivity of RT-LAMP were compared with those of TaqMan RT-PCR. Finally, the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP was examined using RNA extracted from mouse fecal specimens.",

In contrast, the TaqMan RT-PCR required about 3 h, and the reliable detection limit was 105-fold diluted viral RNA, equal to 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 TCID50/reaction. Thus, the RT-LAMP was 50-fold less sensitive than the TaqMan RT-PCR for the detection of the two strains of MNV RNA.",

            "text": "MNV is currently the most common contaminant worldwide in laboratory mouse colonies, and various effects of MNV infection on biomedical research have been reported. In addition, some strains can establish persistent infection even in immunocompetent mice, and infected mice shed the virus in feces over a long time period (Hsu et al., 2006, Thackray et al., 2007). Therefore, there is a necessity to eradicate MNV from mouse colonies in laboratory animal facilities. When a report of MNV elimination from mouse colonies or a health certificate is required to show that the colonies are free from MNV, RT-PCR-based assays are often used to monitor the infection (Kastenmayer et al., 2008, Ohsugi et al., 2013, Tajima et al., 2013). However, they are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive methods compared with serological assays. RT-LAMP does not require an expensive DNA polymerase kit, the expensive and sophisticated equipment required for real-time RT-PCR, and is not time-consuming and requiring of laborious electrophoretic analysis as for conventional RT-PCR. Thus, to overcome disadvantages of RT-PCR-based assays, we developed an RT-LAMP methodology with the potential to detect a broad range of MNV strains. Design of a specific and sensitive primer set is crucial for establishing a successful LAMP assay. However, no primer set designed automatically by PrimerExplore v4 allows the detection of all MNV strains in the GenBank database including Apo455 (GenBank: JN975491) and Apo960 (GenBank: JN975492) from wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (Smith et al., 2012). Thus, a set of primers that satisfied as much as possible, the recommended design features described in the PrimerExplorer v4 guide, were configured manually in the highly conserved region of 308 bases between nucleotides 4854 and 5161 of MNV-1.CW1.",

Thus, various strains of MNV were used to evaluate the broad reactivity and sensitivity of RT-LAMP. However, we could not collect MNV strains other than strains 1.CW1 and S7-PP3. Thus, 10 MNV plasmids were synthesized and used to evaluate the broad reactivity and sensitivity of LAMP. The MNV genome sequences for designing MNV plasmids were chosen based on both the phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2) and the country of origin of strains: 1.CW1, 4, NIH-2747, and WU11 from United States; Apo960 from England; Berlin/04/06 from Germany; KHU-1 from Korea; MT30-2 and S7-PP3 from Japan; and TW2007 from Taiwan. LAMP using a manually designed primer set succeeded in the detection of plasmids containing one of the MNV strains listed in Fig. 1 with equal sensitivity (Table 2). MNV-1.CW1 RNA and MNV-S7-PP3 RNA were then used to evaluate the sensitivity of RT-LAMP. RT-LAMP using the designed primer set also succeeded in the detection of MNV-1.CW1 RNA and MNV-S7-PP3 RNA with equal sensitivity (Table 3). Thus, the primer set is expected to have the potential to detect MNV isolates worldwide with equal sensitivity. The specificity of RT-LAMP was confirmed by negative reactions in the presence of FCV RNA and RNA purified from feces of newly arriving MNV-free mouse strains (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan) determined by Multiplexed Fluorometric ImmunoAssay\u00ae (data not shown). Moreover, the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP exhibited 100% specificity compared with both TaqMan RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR in 120 clinical specimens (Table 3). The primer set is likely to be MNV genome-specific as indicated by in silico analyses using Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) and because the primer set did not amplify RNA purified from MNV-free mice (data not shown). The primer set is therefore expected not to amplify RNA purified from mouse feces other than those contained the MNV genome.",

Thus, it is necessary to update the primer sequences to maintain the high sensitivity of gene amplification methods for detection of a broad range of MNV strains. This is an important point as previously developed RT-PCR-based methods have already lost their broad detection reactivity to known MNV strains. The RT-PCR test developed by Hsu et al. (2005) failed to amplify MNV-S7-PP3 RNA as a template (data not shown). BLAST searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) showed that the forward primer has four mismatches including a mismatch at position \u22123 of the 3\u2032 end to the RNA. Another RT-PCR test developed by Hsu et al. (2006) has a mismatch at position \u22122 of the 3\u2032 end to the genomes of MNV-1.CW2 (GenBank: EU004654) and MNV-1.CW4 (GenBank: EU004655). The nested RT-PCR used in this study (Kitajima et al., 2009) has a mismatch between position \u22122 of the 3\u2032 end of the outer forward primer and strain Lab12 genome (GenBank: JN975493). Another nested RT-PCR developed by Tajima et al. (2013) has a mismatch between position \u22122 of the 3\u2032 end of the inner forward primer and MNV-CR11 genome (GenBank: EU004679). Regarding the TaqMan RT-PCR used in this study (Kitajima et al., 2010), the forward primer has a mismatch at position \u22125 of the 3\u2032 end of Apo960 genome. The reverse primer has two mismatches at positions \u221214 and \u221217 of the 3\u2032 end of Apo960 genome. Thus, primer mismatches in the TaqMan RT-PCR seem to have caused the reduced sensitivity in detecting strain Apo960 (Table 2).",
