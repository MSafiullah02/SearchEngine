Important also would be creating access to secondary care treatment in emergencies provided by specialized physicians; using, to the extent possible, the most modern technologies for the collection of accurate data, storage, and analysis; utilizing telemedicine to reach remote areas, as India has done recently; placing less reliance on private donors given the economic uncertainties and the fact that most tend to approach disease vertically; empowering women and communities; instituting universal insurance coverage; increasing local funding beyond the 15% recommended by the 2001 Abuja Declaration to reach the 2015 target MDGs; and empowering but also regulating local health care entrepreneurs and pharmaceuticals that would produce generic drugs locally, thus reducing the high cost of medicine. In Africa, drug costs have which has varied from city to city, from region to region, and from country to country, making it difficult to rationalize the system continentally. In fact, wherever regulations exist, they are barely enforced (Africa Region Health Report 2013: 114) .",

Of the 54 African countries that pledged to increase the health budget to 15% from 4 to 5%, seven have achieved the goal, but, to do this, the majority have had to rely heavily on international donors; seven have actually reduced their budgets, forcing citizens to pay almost half of their health services out-of-pocket or with as much as 90% of the cost in some countries. Even though Africa accounts for 11-13% of the world population, its disease burden is 24% and Sub-Saharan Africa \"commands less than 1% of global health expenditure\" (African Region Health Report 2013: 13). One may also note that, currently, while HIV/ AIDS prevalence has gone down among adults aged 15-49 years, as low as 1% worldwide, on the continent of Africa, the overall prevalence rate is 7%. These conditions certainly call for the allocation of more resources because poverty and ill health go hand-in-hand. We can also add that 76% of Africans live on less than $2.00 a day, and 46.5% on less than $1.08 a day. Over the past 20 years, the continent has seen its poverty rate spike, while in East and South Asia, the rate has gone down. Moreover, between 1981 and 2001, Africa's GDP decreased by 13%, doubling the number of people living under less than $1.00 a day from 34 million to 64 million people 64 million from 34 million (African Region Health Report 2013) . This number remained static until 2014. Obviously, these bleak figures do not speak well of the health systems currently operating on the continent of Africa, even if one or two of the eight MDGs might have been reached by a handful of countries in 2015.",

Unable to get the required data from most African countries, the IAPO could only use five: Malawi, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia and assessed the state of the six health systems building blocks, namely: (1) leadership and governance, which assess the legal framework of national management, health sector management, national institutional framework for multisectoral management, and components of national programs on health sector management; (2) sustainable financing (national and sub-national strategies for financing health sector management); (3) health workforce (human resources for the health sector); (4) medicines and vaccines; (5) information (information management systems for risk reduction and emergency preparedness programs, information management systems for response and recovery, and risk communication); and (6) service delivery (response capacity and capability, EMS system and mass casualty management, management of hospitals in mass casualty incidents, continuity of essential health programs and services, logistics, and operational support functions) (World Health Organization 2012: .",

While Namibia was making progress in its training and employment of qualified birth attendants (Tumusiime et al. 2012: 1) , Chad and Zimbabwe had the worse maternal mortality among the 12 countries that have the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. The study also pointed out that, even the five countries that had the most relevant and most adequate information suffered from several shortcomings making their health systems ineffective: absence of policies and guideline on the health goals; shortage of human resources; shortage of medicines; lack of attainment of the target of 15% increase in the health budget as agreed at Abuja in 2001; a not fully utilized and fragmented system; and inadequate health service coverage.",

Achieving the MDGs will require timely national refocusing on health sector policies and commitment to health systems strengthening\" (Tumusiime 2012: 1) . Further analysis of each of the six health systems building blocks found that all five countries, except Malawi, had national health policies, as well as national health sector strategic plans or programs of work, and that all had incor-porated the MDGs in national policies and plans. On sustainable health financing, the study revealed that financing had remained stable in the five countries since 2002, but notable was the fact that Malawi and Zambia had increased the budget to over 15% as pledged. Out-of-pocket expenditures, as a percentage of private expenditure on health, \"varied from 5.7% in Namibia to 80% in the year 2006\" (Tumusiime 2012: 1-3) . Kenya's and Namibia's public health services [had] a policy of applying user fees at the hospital level with the former exempting under-five children. Uganda abolished user fees in 2001, whereas Zambia abolished them in 54 selected rural districts in 2004. Malawi did not apply user fees, at all, for health.",

            "text": "According to Karla Meursing, IMF conditionalities or structural adjustment programs had a direct negative impact on \"both the accessibility and quality of public health care\" in Zimbabwe, resulting in a fee increase to Z$50 for out-patient treatment, while raising the cost of one day admission to the hospital to Z$200 (Meursing 1997: 39) . Zimbabwe's health system, for example, was doing extremely well during the 1980s, when primary health care was a priority and hundreds of health facilities were built. In fact, the government aimed at building so many health centers that no Zimbabwean would have to walk more than 10 miles to the next health center. By the early 1990s, in fact, all citizens, even in the rural areas, did not have to walk more than 0.5 miles to the closest health facility (Azevedo et al. 1997) . In 1991, however, Zimbabwe accepted a loan from the IMF, with the required structural adjustment programs, and introduced user fees. That was enough to change the system and make life miserable for most Zimbabweans. Structural adjustment programs also resulted in billions of dollars of debt for Africa, some of which had to be forgiven for such countries as Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda, because African governments were finding it more and more difficult to abide by the terms of the loans, even at interest rates as low as 4% per annum. Today, 34 of the 42 indebted countries continue to be in the African Region. In Zimbabwe, IMF loan acceptance also led to a rise in the price of all imported drugs and hospital equipment, making them four times more expensive partly due to devaluation of the currency. At the time, Media Guild argued that user fees and the higher cost of essential drugs resulted in a lower rate of preventive and curative care the poor needed and an increase in the number of deaths (Media Guild 1990s) . User fees for rural areas were later terminated but the scarcity of first line drugs and qualified health workers continued.",

The study notes, however, that the vacancy rates were worsened by recruitment freezes in Kenya and Uganda in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Disturbing was the fact that, in Namibia, in 2008, most of the doctors, dentists, and pharmacists were in private practice and served only about 15% of the population, mostly in urban areas. For all five countries, most of the resources favored urban populations, especially in Zambia and Uganda. Availability and provision of medicines and vaccines, including oral rehydration salts, Coartem, Cotrimoxazole, measles vaccines, tracer drugs and first line medicines, such as anti-malarial drugs, were a major problem in all five countries, as some regions did not have 50% of the supplies needed.",

Critically ill patients were warehoused without treatment and often without diagnosis until they died, or until their families took them home in despair. Nutritional rehabilitation units had no food. Hospital and clinics could not count on long-term allocation of the most basic resources, including human resources. Students held the government responsible for the failure of the allocation; and with increased clinical experience, most came to see the national economy as pathogenic and the government as pathological: 'not normal'. (Wendland 2010: 182) Regarding data and information, all five countries had a health information system \"as the main source of routine health data.\" Thus, all five had a relatively satisfactory reporting system: Namibia had reached 80% of timeliness and completeness of national reporting of disease surveillance data from its districts; Zambia's record was 99% in 2007; in Uganda, 83% of the districts provided weekly surveillance reports to the national office, but only 56% did this timely.

On the issues involved in the first health system building block, leadership and governance, Africa appeared too weak to advance the health goals forward by underperforming, regardless of the resources it was able to master. Even if some of the MDGs might have been achieved by 2015, it remains clear that Africa's leadership is failing when measured against the health outcomes in other continents.

Their thesis is the more relevant as they refer to African stewardship and the crisis the health system is experiencing virtually everywhere on the continent. They point out that effective stewardship is the government's key role in oversight and trusteeship, which involves formulating health policy, defining the strategic vision clearly, and articulating the direction the leadership wishes to see the health system follow. This is strengthened by exerting influence and vocalizing in word and action the approaches to regulations guiding the health system, and collecting and using intelligence (data and information) effectively. In sum, stewardship implies vision, \"overall system design and policy formulation; setting priorities, and \"performance and impact assessment for outcomes, promotion of health and advocacy; and establishment of norms, standards, and ethical framework.\" In their assessment, the two authors note that African systems are among the \"most bureaucratic and least effective managed institutions in the public sector. The ministries are fragmented with vertical programs, or ritual chiefdoms, dependent on certain donor funding.\" The description could not be more accurate to anyone who has visited an African hospital to be treated, as chapters in this volume emphasize, ranging from an uncountable absenteeism to unauthorized financial charges by doctors that circumvent the official care provision in public and private health facilities to delays of treatment on alleged equipment failures.

Yet, African countries are characterized by persistent and in many cases worsening social, economic, and gender, and health inequalities. (Sama and Nguyen 2008:10) (author's emphasis) there may be private health insurance for a few and some free health services here and there, but it is mainly extended social networks (which may be more or less based on varying notions of kinship) that insure against health risks. (Sama and Nguyen 2008: 10) A major constraint of Africa's health systems is the user fee issue. In Kenya, for example, the introduction of user fees, also known as \"cash and carry approach,\" had a negative impact on the health of the population, even though, to offset the individual costs, the government allowed several exemptions and waivers for the poor, those who were enrolled in family planning, children under-five, patients with sexually transmitted diseases, and other categories (Alfred Anangwe 2008: 44) . Yet this did not help the situation, even with the efforts to expand insurance coverage to as many people as possible, including those without employment. This study also revealed that there were several and serious gaps in the Kenya health system, estimated at close to 20-35% of the total population, namely, only those who contribute to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), while the rest qualify only for \"more traditional insurance, and need to be enrolled in some flexible risk-pooling schemes.\" The Kenyan health system, like most in Africa, suffers from the following serious shortcomings (Anangwe 2008: 57):",

This approach will reveal the intractable colonial health legacies Africa inherited from the colonial past. We may start with the three former members of the East African Community, which were supposed to coordinate health strategies and goals-Tanzania, Kenya, and Ugandaand their devastating impact, especially on the poor. It will look at the resources and the current structure of their health care systems, beginning with Tanzania. Tanzania, a country of 44 million, is said to follow a pyramidal model or a bottom-up approach, which begins at the village level and reaches the apex at the most advanced, but also most expensive, approach to providing health care. Obviously, if such a system is not well handled, it can ruin the effectiveness and efficiency of the whole health care system and make it inaccessible to the poor, who often constitute the majority. The UN and the World Bank define poverty in the developing world as a person's condition characterized by an income that is $1.50 or less a day (others say less than $2.00 a day). For the sake of simplification, in this work we use the rate of $2.00/day or less for the poverty level. Tanzania's health care structure begins with the thousands of village health services scattered throughout the country at the bottom, superseded, in ascending order, by dispensary health services, district hospitals, regional hospitals, and referral and consultant hospitals at the top (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare Services, Tanzania 2013). The Village Health Services, built as the first line of defense against ill health and disease, serve the most remote and rural areas of Tanzania, mostly poor and isolated, providing only the most basic preventive primary health care, which can be dispensed even at home. This level of facilities is staffed by two village health workers, who are selected by the village council and briefly trained to respond to villagers' non-threatening health conditions. The dispensary health services, or the second level, provide more advanced preventive care catered for localities that have a larger population ranging from 6000 to 10,000. The third level of the pyramid, the health center, offers more advanced services to up to 50,000 people, comparable to the population of one administrative division, and are sources of patient referrals to the next level, namely, the district hospital (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare 2013). These health facilities have x-ray equipment and an advanced laboratory component, perform surgery, provide emergency obstetrics care, and admit in-patients and out-patients. However, the major weakness of the health system in Tanzania, as pointed out by knowledgeable analysts, is that it is run by assistant medical doctors (who are nothing but glorified physicians), clinical officers with just two years of training, one clinical officer, and a few registered nurses.",

Required employees at the district hospitals include one environmental health officer, a records officer, a dentist, and a pharmacist. Despite their theoretically impressive health care set up, the district hospitals, just as the rest of the health care facilities and services, are overwhelmed by the number of people that come for treatment from throughout the district with immense health needs. Population pressure brought to bear by the country's fertility and its demographic growth estimated at close to 3% annually make the health situation difficult to manage. The resources are simply mishandled and cannot meet the needs of so many people. With government backing, many of the district hospitals enter into an agreement with religious organizations and receive assistance from the state. Each region has its own hospital, which has a good number of highly trained specialists and offer more advanced and comprehensive services than the dispensary health services.",

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare oversees all hospitals, even though the system has been decentralized, and has several departments that supervise critical programs, some permanent, and some temporary, such as National AIDS Control, Reproductive Child Health, TB and Leprosy, and School Health. Centralization through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has been one of the weaknesses noted by the experts. One expert observes that among other weaknesses, the strategy of primary care is fragmented and the management system is not optimal because of excessive centralization (Yaya and Ileka-Priozeau 2010: 65) .",

However, co-payment, the insurance requirement, and the emerging physicians' private practice have worked to the disadvantage of the poor, children, and pregnant women, who, even though entitled to free treatment, are often required to prove that they are poor. This requirement creates stigma and discourages most non-educated rural populations from seeking assistance. The user fee has been instituted, withdrawn and reinstituted, and, at one point, the government even tried to outsource some of the health service delivery (Brennell and Breannon 2012) . One must also note that the user fees get larger as the pyramid reaches the top. Government employees, who account for 6% of the population in Tanzania, must buy a plan with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) at the rate of 6.0% of their income. The informal sector in rural Tanzania may voluntarily pay the premium to the Community Health Fund (CHF), an institution that also insures the indigents and those who are unable to buy insurance, as well as people \"less likely to get treatment due to user fees\" (Wong 2013). The remaining population is forced to resort to the service of traditional healers, which is replete with cultural and curative \"baggage.\"",

It is also pyramidal and consists of dispensaries, health centers, sub-district hospitals, district hospitals, assisted by thousands of private clinics (7000 in 2011), provincial hospitals, national hospitals, and nursing homes staffed by nurses and physicians. The dispensary, staffed by trained and registered nurses, is the least equipped of all and provides the most basic out-patient care, such as dispensing malaria pills and injections and common flu medication, and refers the most serious cases to the next level of care provision. The health centers, under clinical officers or nurses, are designed to serve at least 8000 people, providing some (preventive) primary health care, dispensing such basic services as immunizations, and are staffed by clinical officers, nurses, health administration officers, pharmaceutical and medical technologists, public health officers, nutritionists, and the necessary day-to-day supporting staff, such as drivers and housekeepers. These health centers are much more complex in organization and treat out-and in-patients, perform all necessary tests in laboratories, have maternal and child care wings, perform minor operations, such as circumcision, and have facilities where students are trained to perform care responsibilities, and an attached pharmacy. These two characteristics do not seem to exist in Tanzanian health centers.",

The latter are not a feature of the Tanzanian health care system, at least not in title. The next level of care is provided by the country's eight provincial hospitals, which are referrals for the lower level of the health care pyramid. These are regional centers and provide more advanced and specialized intensive care, such as life supporting care, along with specialized consultations and treatment.

Health Insurance through the National Insurance Fund (NHIF) is mandated for all salaried Kenyan employees but voluntary membership for those who are self-employed is accepted, just as is the case in Tanzania. Currently, the fees range from 160 to 320 Kenyan shillings or between $2.00 and $4.00. The state's future plan is to match payment against a person's salary on a percentage basis. When members and dependents fall ill and are admitted into an accredited hospital, they pay only the balance after a rebate is figured out, which may range from 400 to 2000 Kenyan shillings ($5.00-$22.10) a day. Kenya is seriously moving to a universal insurance coverage based on income, as the constitution of 2012 still maintains that \"every Kenyan has a right to quality and affordable health care, and recognizes the role of the government in removing barriers to access.\"",

At the lowest level, the country operates the village health teams or community medicine distributors, who are volunteers, some travelling on a bicycle, and provide basic medical advice to patients and refer them to the appropriate health facilities, unlike in Kenya or Tanzania. The next level is the health center II in each parish, which caters for a few thousands of people and treats such common diseases as malaria and flu, and provides antenatal care. On paper, it is staffed by a nurse and a midwife. These health facilities admit in-patients. The health center III is located in a sub-county and is run by a staff of 18, has a laboratory, and is supervised by a clinical officer. The health center IV is designed to serve a county and has men, women, and children's wards, admits in-patients, and is run by a senior medical officer, an extra physician, and has an emergency operations theater. The next level is the regional referral hospital. At least 10 of these exist in Uganda and provide all services, including those found at the health center IV, and have specialized clinics and mental health and dentistry facilities, with several consultant physicians. In practice, these often function as \"mini-hospitals.\" At the top of the Ugandan pyramidal structure are the three national referral and teaching Hospitals (Mulago and Makerere, in Kampala, and Mbarara in Mbarara City, Northwestern Uganda), which have the best physicians, many of whom are in private practice.",

Also, in Uganda, the village level volunteer system is quite unreliable, and the heavy emphasis on a referral system may simply \"pass the buck\" to the next level; it also suffers from a lack of basic drugs, even for malaria. Furthermore, most ambulant health advisors do not have a bicycle and perform most of their work on foot. A few of the Health Centers II have no laboratories. At times, many do not have water and electricity or possess generators during emergencies. Also, level IV facilities often lack an adequate number of physicians who, at times, must see 100 patients a day, as is the case in Tiriri (Kavuma 2009 Kwesigabo) .",

The system is understaffed and carries a heavy workload. Supportive supervision for districts by MOH and district health teams for primary health facilities is also inadequate due to poor funding save for partners such as PEPFAR, USAID, and CDC, which channel donor funds to the national health care system and improve data quality. Data capturing and reporting is still largely paper-based, and only a few initiatives on electronic health management information system are underway but are donor-driven. What is needed is the strengthening of the capacity of the MOH and the district health systems through skills training, improving staffing, and regularly supporting supervision. Therefore, increasing funding with strict accountability for such health systems and improving activities are not an option but a priority. Along with the problems noted for the three Eastern African countries, the health care system faces many challenges daily, and Tanzania is illustrative of the situation.

Muhimbili National Hospital alone, which employs more than 259 physicians, had some 2900 patients awaiting treatment for days. Nurses refused to show for work claiming that they could not do so without the presence of doctors. As a result, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare had to deploy 67 doctors employed at the Ministry headquarters to temporarily replace the striking physicians. At first, former President Jikaya Kikwete told the strikers that they should rather quit their government jobs than strike. However, under pressure, a day later, he promised to raise the salary but only for those who were not involved in the strike-from the monthly salary of $620 (500 British pounds at the current exchange rate) to $727 (600 pounds) in 2012-2013. The doctors, however, were asking for an increase of up to $2200 (1,761 pounds), plus allowances and bonuses. During the turmoil, the 1000 member Tanzanian Medical Association alleged that thugs at gun point kidnapped Dr. Steven Ulimboka, their Chairman, drove him to the outskirts of the capital, beat, and tortured him. One doctor claimed that he had treated the Chairman for damage to his finger nails. The President denied the allegations. Fortunately, the strike stopped within a week and salary negotiations resumed in earnest. However, this is not the first time East African doctors have led a strike.",

The strike of 1981 resulted in the closing of the University of Nairobi and the arrest of some 300 doctors between May 7 and June 3, which led to many physicians' decision to move into private practice. The most recent doctors' strike in Kenya happened in December 2013, when thousands of patients were stranded at the hospitals in Narok North District Hospital, Ololulunga Hospital in Narok South, and Transmara District Hospital, indirectly contributing to preventable deaths. The patients suffered of diseases ranging from malaria to common cold, and from arthritis to sexually transmitted diseases. The situation was so serious that traditional healers were inundated with patients, and many Tanzanian healers made camp along the frontier, collected fees, and went to work. One of the Kenyan residents along the border said: \"We cannot wait for our people to die when we have traditional doctors, herbs and hospitals in Tanzania\" (Sayagie 2013: 1) .",

As Iliffe added, the tug of war between the state and the doctors has been constant, in which, for the physicians, the state was \"both enemy, blocking their aspirations, and the protector against the latent hostility of the unsophisticated. The ambiguity was to remain until independence, and beyond.\" In other words, there has been a love and hate relationship between the two. Just as in Kenya and Tanzania, many doctors have since chosen private practice, where their salaries might be as high as 2,000 pounds a year compared to that of the 1950s-that is, twice the government salary simply by \"injection practice\"-as was common saying-rising from 150 pounds in the 1940s to 420-720 pounds in 1952.

Houphouet-Boigny had served as Minister without Portfolio in the French Cabinet in Paris, which explains why, for a long time, Cote d'Ivoire remained the health showcase of French colonial policy in Africa. Unfortunately, the country is now besieged with serious health problems, particularly as a result of the 2010-2011 civil war, and weakened by a natural prevalence of tropical and non-tropical diseases such as malaria, yaws, yellow fever, meningitis, leprosy, trachoma, helminthiasis, elephantiasis, and, of course, HIV/AIDS. The latter has a prevalence rate of 4.7% in the country, especially among those aged 15-49, currently one of the highest in West Africa. However, vital statistics reveal that the country's high HIV rate is lower among men than women, about 2.9% and 6.4%, respectively. The war destroyed several hospitals and health centers, especially in the north of the country.

In addition, as noted above, Cote D'Ivoire has at least one good psychiatric hospital, which is rare in Africa even today. Yet, like in other parts of Africa, the health system suffers from several deficiencies, including the following: 40% of the health workforce is concentrated in the Lagunas urban region, especially Abidjan, where only 24% of the people live; in 2001, no other region had 10% of the workforce. In 2004, the distribution of the workforce was as follows: Lagunas, doctors, 60%; nurses, 48%; pharmacists, 74%; laboratory technicians, 48%; social workers, 67%; and private health professionals, 25%. The concentration of facilities in the Lagunas urban region means that 76% of the population is under-served in favor of one region that houses the capital city, Abidjan. Furthermore, to underscore the weakness of the system, 81% of the hospitals have laboratory facilities but only 10% of the health centers or clinics have one. Regarding service delivery and free care, available prior to the 1990s, these were eliminated thereafter and restored in 2011 post-war Cote d'Ivoire.",

The ultimate aim was to quickly decentralize the system, but, for the local community leaders, the problem has come from lack of adequate training and experience in \"planning and management.\" The Bamako Initiative also encouraged user fees and pharmaceutical sales as part of the system, with the state paying the salaries of state employees and discretionary amounts of funding being sent to local communities that would determine how to spend their resources. Existing insurance schemes are community-based, voluntary and from not-for-profit organizations managed by the community. This even includes maternal health, which, under normal circumstances, is the purview of the national government.

The system is slow and unreliable. Use of four wheel vehicles is too expensive in upkeep. Furthermore, even a four wheel vehicle cannot easily travel through the country to help medical facilities' staff and meet their transportation needs. Thus, in the rural areas, most people have to walk as many as 20 kilometers to get to the next health facility; data collection is poorly done; social and religious barriers (Christianity and Islam) at times prevent the system from functioning smoothly; and out-of-stock medical supplies are also expensive; and certain prescriptions are not available for a long period of time at certain health facilities. The disparities in access to care (and to quality care) are high. Reliance on French hand-outs is also high, and, as a result of the weak health system, Senegal did not achieve the 2015 MDGs. We might mention here that international assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa decreased from $34 per capita in 1990 to $21 in 2001. Even though developed countries pledged to provide at least 0.7% of their annual income to Sub-Saharan Africa, as of 2006, only Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden had followed through with their promise.

Rwanda is said to have one of the best health care systems in Africa, along with Botswana, and a few other countries, such as Ghana. Its system has universal health coverage for the Rwandans, with most mutual schemes having adopted a community-based sliding scale of medical costs ranging between 33 US cents and $8. Those insured are expected to contribute up to one-tenth of their financial resources to their medical bills. As of 2014, only 4% of the Rwandans were not insured. Currently, Rwanda's health system also provides antiretroviral therapy to 80% of those suffering of HIV/AIDS, a rate experts consider to be higher than that of the US, where only 50% enjoy such treatment (April International 2012). For efficiency, the Rwandan health system, at least in theory, claims that it pays salaries to health personnel based on performance only. However, the inherent weakness of the health insurance coverage system lies in that 45% of the operating health costs for universal care come from medical insurance premiums, while all other costs are contingent upon international donations. This is a weakness common to almost all African health care systems. However, to appreciate the reason why the Rwandan health system seems to perform better than others in Africa, one must keep in mind that the task is made a bit easier by the fact that Rwanda is one of the smallest countries in Africa, with a population of only 11 million (2013).",

Yet, the intractable problem remains with the non-salaried Angolans regarding health care, drugs, water, fuel, and medical supplies.

Mozambique suffers from major floods virtually every five years, costing lives, crops, livestock, and homes from such rivers as Zambezi, Rovue, and Limpopo. Despite the frequency of these natural calamities, the country is never ready through well thought out and effective emergency plans, a clear indication of a flawed health care system that barely meets international or regional standards.

Equatorial Guinea is considered to be a high income country, mainly as a result of the enormous oil reserves being extracted and refined mainly by the Marathon Oil Corporation, making it one of the five major producers of oil in Africa. As expected, the country suffers from the same tropical diseases as others in the region: malaria, TB, measles, yellow fever, leprosy, trypanosomiasis, schistoso-miasis, meningitis, and others such as HIV/AIDS. Overall, infectious diseases represent 85% of the consultations in the country, and diarrhea alone accounts for half of the visits, while flu, the major endemic illness, represents 61% of the country's illnesses. TB's deadly impact is estimated at 15% among patients on treatment, and most of it is due to late diagnosis and HIV co-infections. About 60% of its population lives in rural areas, with a life expectancy at birth of 52.08 years compared to the average in Sub-Saharan Africa of 55.92-still a major accomplishment for a country located in some of the worst disease-prone areas of the continent. Another major accomplishment of this tiny state is the fact that more than 50% of the population now has access to clean drinking water, when in several parts of Africa the figure does not reach 36%. Also, maternal mortality rate stands at 240 per100,000 live births (2010), compared to the average of 494.53 per 100,000 across Sub-Saharan Africa; the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers stands at 64.6 contrasted to 33.14% in other Sub-Saharan African countries (USAID 2013: 4). The prevalence rate of HIV is 4.7% compared to 7.0% in the Sub-Saharan region. Against malaria, Equatorial Guinea has a relatively higher rate of children sleeping under a bed net in the region, 2.7%, as opposed to 0.7 in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the under-five mortality rate is estimated at 100.3 per 100,000 live births, which is higher when compared to the rest of Sub-Sahara, where, on the average, it is 94.27 per 100,000. Yet, fertility here is extremely high at 5.4 per woman (2011), a little higher than in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, estimated at 5.23 per woman.",

On health financing, the second building block, Equatorial Guinea spends only 3% of its GDP on health, despite its huge oil revenues, when, elsewhere in Africa, the figure is around 5.0-6.34%. However, to its credit, Equatorial Guinea does not over rely on international donors for health funding: 1.75% of the health budget is made up of international donations compared to 23.8% average for the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. Because the government does not provide health insurance coverage to its citizens, notwithstanding the vast oil revenues, citizens spend about 93.5% in health costs using out-of-pocket money, contrasted to the average cost attributed to people in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely, 73.7%.",

In fact, the country does not meet the standards of the Joint Learning Initiative of 2004, which \"set a threshold for density of physicians, nurses, and midwives of 25 per 10,000 to achieve 80% coverage or skilled birth attendance and measles immunization.\" On management of medical products, vaccines, and technologies, the fifth building block, Equatorial Guinea falls short compared to the region and to other high income countries, achieving, in fact, only close to half of what others achieved in 2006.

This is best summarized by Spielberg and Adams (2011: 13), when they write that the health care system in Africa is organized under a National Ministry of Health (MOH) and Departments within the ministry address key health issues such as the regulation and oversight of public hospitals, preventive care services, and maternal and child health. The ministry is responsible for both public health services and direct patient care services. Most health facilities-from large, tertiary referral hospitals (usually situated in large urban areas) to the smallest health clinic or outpost-are part of the public-sector national health system. Most healthcare providers are employed by the government, and work at public health-care facilities where care is generally provide free of charge. However, patients may have to pay fees for diagnostic tests as chest x-rays, laboratory tests, and prescribed medications. In many countries, national policy dictates [on paper and not in reality] that children under age five and pregnant women are exempt from these fees and receive all care free of charge.",

On the other hand, if someone is unhealthy, the likelihood is that he will not be able to function properly in society and might spend all his meager resources and energies trying to be well, which might perpetuate his state of poverty or force him to lead an unfulfilling life. Poverty is a consequence of social and political inequalities or disparities that should never be allowed-and can be eradicated just as the disease itself. This is not to deny, of course, that individual behavior may lead one to poverty. However, it is also clear that no one wishes to be poor. Many people are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty since the day they are born, and therefore the risk to their health is high. As the WHO says, \"the poorest almost always experience higher mortality levels, die younger (on average), and experience higher levels of child and maternity mortality,\" because \"causality between poverty and ill health is bi-directional, demonstrated in both macro-level (cross-national and national) and micro-level (individual, household, and community) studies\" (Quoted from World Bank 2004: 3).",

ECOSOC is clear on the obligation governments have in eliminating poverty as a priority and health systems' moral obligation to make care accessible to all citizens: \"Closing the gap [between rich and poor] is a matter of social justice-we should do it because it is the right thing to do. It is an intensely moral issue. We put at the center of what we were trying to achieve empowerment, which we think of a material, psycho-social and political, having a voice. In the spirit of justice, we seek to help create the conditions for people to lead flourishing lives.\" (ECOSOC Members' Dialogue Forum 2009: 34) .

One flight from Sierra Leone to Nigeria carrying an infected passenger may have contributed to the virus appearing across borders for the first time in the many years of its existence in an isolated area to a country, such as Nigeria, where it had never been seen before. Ebola, for which no effective cure has been found and kills as many as 60% of its victims, is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where it erupted first in 1976. Thereafter, it slowly and intermittently spread to surrounding countries, and by July 2014, it had reached Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria. On July 28, 2014, an American working in Liberia took a flight to Nigeria and collapsed after landing at Lagos. He was taken to the hospital for testing and treatment, but he died immediately, and Ebola was diagnosed as the cause of his death. Preventive measures, such as closely monitoring the borders were put in place, flights to and from certain countries cancelled, and schools and markets closed. Speculations are that the disease is transmit-ted from non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, to man. Its symptoms include muscle aches, headaches, fevers, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rashes, red eyes, and breathing and swallowing difficulties, and leads to profuse internal bleeding, which may appear in body orifices, such as the nose, eye, and rectum, and is contracted from person to person through body fluids. Its incubation period ranges from two to 21 days, but some had suspected that the infection might spread even in the preactive phase of the disease. Non-sterilized equipment such as syringes used in different patients is also one of the vectors of the infection.",

However, a similar virus, Marburg, was discovered in the town of Marburg, Germany, in 1967, identified as originating from non-human primates, and has also appeared in Central and East Africa, including Uganda. Both Ebola and Marburg are hemorrhagic fevers and both are deadly, but they react differently to antibodies. Interestingly, this German connection is never mentioned when the origins of the disease are discussed. The most vulnerable to the disease are relatives of the infected persons and health workers, including doctors and nurses, some of whom lost their lives trying to save the sick. Funerals for the infected dead have proven to be also one of the sources of contagion, as people refuse to abandon traditional practices that allow the living to touch the dead or wash them without proper protective gear. In fact, health workers trying to monitor the funerals have been stoned or beaten by the mourners (ABC News 2014).",

Says Garry Smith (2013): \"Even though two-thirds of the world's poor live in Asia and one-third in Africa, the level of poverty in Africa is by comparison far more widespread and endemic.\" While Africa's per capita income is lower than it was on the eve of independence over 30 years ago, 50-60% of the people live below the poverty line of $1.00 a day. Yet, the more Africa is given, the poorer its population becomes! In Sierra Leone, for example, a small country that, for the past few years, has received over $1 billion in aid, the majority of the citizens still live in absolute poverty. As the WHO puts it again in reference to the continent, \"about two-thirds of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa survives week by week on what someone in the United Kingdom earns from just one hour's work on the minimum wage\" (African Region Health Report 2013: 30). The scaling up of the interaction between poverty and ill health is a result of the following risk factors: income poverty; nutrition and health; ill health; \"livelihood strategies\"; and \"modalities of coping with vulnerability to ill health.\" Uganda is an excellent example of this phenomenon. The country's effort to reduce poverty fell from 56% in 1992 to 35% in 1999, even though many households remained poor \"while others moved up.\" Furthermore, Uganda's participatory Poverty Assessment Process indicated that \"over 37% of communities thought that ill health was a major cause of moving into poverty\" (Republic of Uganda 2002). Most of the poverty studies have also shown the existence of an association \"between the original status of the household head and household moving into poverty\" (African Region Health Report 2014: 9).",

His address reiterates what constitutes poverty and how poverty impacts health. David Lawson also notes that, in Southern Africa, poverty is no longer focused on income differences and key indicators, such as morbidity, mortality, and nutrition. Since 1984, he adds, the focus has been on a \"multidimensional and people centered understanding of poverty and welfare,\" encouraging researchers and policy-makers to focus on the individual, which takes into consideration his or her capabilities to function normally as expected by society. In his analysis, Lawson almost equates poverty itself to a disease, as he writes: From such perspectives, preventable deaths and ill-health are not merely outcomes of poverty but integral components of poverty itself, measuring simultaneously the NDP's human development index (HDI) and human poverty index (HIP) that incorporate health indicators in their compilation (Lawson 2004: 2) .",

There is a gradient in health that runs from top to bottom the socioeconomic spec-trum\u2026This is a global phenomenon seen in low, middle and high income countries\" (The WHO Report 2011: 200). It is also a fact that poverty is often a generational phenomenon from which many individuals cannot extricate themselves. As the UN again reveals, \"The multi-generational nature of poverty, with successive generations inheriting the disadvantages of their predecessors, means that over the years poverty and deprivation have become part of the characterization of particular racial and ethnic groups trapped in poverty\" (Social Watch 2013: 1-4). Incidentally, as the UN finally notes, \"it takes 1% of the global income to eradicate all poverty in the world in a year, equivalent to 0.5% of the annual world income, to provide universal access to basic social services (basic education, health, nutrition, and access to water and sewage disposal)\" (WHO Regional Office Africa 2011). Sadly, as of 2011, 33 of the 49 poorest countries in the world are in Africa, and, in 1985, Africa represented 16% of the world's poor. This number grew to 31% by 1998, and, in 2011, the WHO noted, \"the trend is likely to continue, with poverty expected to decline over the next 20 years in every part of the world, except Sub-Saharan Africa, where a dramatic increase is expected,\" HIV/AIDS playing a major role in this process (WHO Regional Office Africa 2011: 3).",

Second, the growing consensus in Africa about the right to health through universal insurance has been strengthened by a positive response from the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. UN agencies working for \"Sustainable Development for Post-2015\"-following achievement of the MDGs-support the principle that all health benefits must be enjoyed by all on equal terms \"while making financial contributions according to their ability to pay: UHC means that healthy, wealthy people must subsidize services for the sick and the poor\" (see Yates 2013) . This consensus is a result of continued failure of private voluntary insurances and community-based schemes over the past several decades. Relying on solid studies, OXFAM stresses the point that social health insurance as a percentage of a person's income and general taxation are the best models to ensure that the health of all citizens is equally protected. To this WHO adds: \"Any insurance scheme must be judged on impact on the entire population\" and not just on the rich, which implies the need for a \"compulsory public system and use of financial taxation to cover informal sectors,\" as is already been done in South Africa and Rwanda, both of which are moving toward universal insurance coverage.",

            "text": "In such countries as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia, over 40% of people below the 20% bracket or income level are using health care from private for-profit insurers. However, experts fear that this will most likely create a two-tier provision of care \"that will benefit some but harm the concept of equal access to quality care for all citizens\" (Economist Intelligence 2011: 14) . Some estimate that, by 2020, private spending from employers, not-for-profit organizations insurance corporations, and non-governmental institutions will reach $28 billion, about 17% of the total health care expenditures in Africa. Optimists believe that more than half of Sub-Saharan Africa or 70% of the African Region (excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Eritrea, Sudan, and Somalia)-if the economic conditions continue to improve at the pace seen over the past five years and the leadership changes for the better-might be able to commit a minimum of $60 per capita health spending by the majority of the Sub-Saharan African countries. In Tanzania, as briefly noted earlier, the NHIF covers civil servants, who are 6% of the population, at a rate of 6% of their income (Azevedo et al. 2014) . Such a change would be a drastic jump from the current single digit per capita health spending by the majority of the Sub-Saharan African countries. In Tanzania, as briefly noted earlier, the NHIF covers civil servants, who are 6% of the population, at a rate of 6% of their income (Azevedo et al. 2014: 242) . The informal sector may purchase insurance from the CHF, which is a voluntary insurance scheme that also insures those classified as \"indigents\" and others unable to afford one, as well as people that are \"less likely to get treatment due to user fees\" (Wong 2013). The remaining citizens have no other recourse but to rely on the services of the traditional healers.",

The scheme sounds cheap but not for someone who makes no more than $10 a month. In this setting, people have to choose between health and nutrition and other important necessities of life. A poor person, defined as making less than $2.00 or less a day, affording insurance is simply impossible. Kenya's future plans are to match proportionally a person's income with the rate to be paid to the NHIF, which is a step toward universal health coverage mentioned above. The 2012 Kenya constitution notes that all citizens have the right to \"quality and affordable health care,\" placing the responsibility to remove \"barriers to access\" on the government. Currently, if members and dependents fall sick and are admitted as in-patients at a hospital, they are charged only the balance after a rebate of between 400 and 2,000 Kenya shillings or $5.00-$22. The problem with universal health coverage is the more pressing since such issues as occupational safety, vehicle and crash protection (of both driver and passenger), and environmental hazard protection are virtually non-existent, and, if they exist, their enforcement is lax.",

In 2006, for example, Burundi introduced free services for pregnant women, and so did Burkina Faso by providing an 80% subsidy policy for deliveries. Kenya already provides free antenatal care, while Ghana's free delivery care introduced for the first time in 2004 caused maternal death rates of 500 per 100,000 live births to plummet to 350 per 100,000 in 2008, but still experts doubted that the country would reach the MDG of 185 per 100,000 by 2015, most likely due to a high number of women still not using properly trained midwives. Almost unexplainably, the use of biomedically trained midwives in Ghana dropped from 54% to 35% in 2007, after a healthy improvement over 1993. Pressured by the IMF's structural adjustment programs during the 1980s and 1990s, some African countries adopted the practice of requiring co-payments from all patients (to abolish them later or exempting some segments of the population), while others, like Tanzania, toyed with the idea of outsourcing this aspect of medical care (Brennell and Breannon 2012) .",

            "text": "Under pressure from the IMF, Mali and Mauritania have introduced community-sharing schemes to make out-of-pocket payments more affordable and reduce maternal and neonatal deaths. Even though Tanzania has virtually exempted the poor, children, and pregnant women from co-payments, yet, against the spirit of the guidelines, the latter have to prove that they are poor. This odd requirement has contributed to further stigma, thus defeating the purpose of the legislation. Furthermore, the assessed fee gets higher as the health pyramid system reaches the apex, the referral national hospitals. The claim of free services is, however, deceiving. For example, when mothers or children are seen by the doctor freely, syringes, drugs, gowns, and other essential components are the responsibility of the patients. Often, when they might have the funds, they are unable to purchase the medication prescribed by the doctor because the pharmacy may be either out-of-stock of the items or the prices specifically recommended to the pharmacy by the doctor or the government are too expensive. This is done in violation of the guidelines set by the government, which is supposed to provide these items free of charge. In Tanzania, it is possible to frequently see a truck full of internationally donated syringes designed to be distributed freely by the hospital and then realize that the patients are being asked to pay for them! Overall, maternal deaths are still the highest in Africa compared to other continents of the world, and they are associated not only with diseases but also with a lack of resources invested for maternal well-being. Maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa is also exacerbated by the rate of induced abortions which are often done in secrecy because of the stigma and the fact that laws governing this issue are often based on religious grounds. Studies show that 40-50% of mothers' deaths in Africa are due to botched abortions. Yet, politicians close their eyes and speak only of punishment of the culprits while forgetting to deal with the root causes or the resulting social dynamics; the need for ensuring that pregnant women enjoy a modicum of acceptable nutrition; and that birth delivery is done appropriately, that is, by biomedically trained midwives as well as experienced traditional attendants, who, for centuries now, have saved so many lives. Also, that mothers are given the proper post-partum care before they are released from the delivery health facility. Infant mortality constitutes another silent crisis in Africa, where it is clear that things have worsened from the early 1960s, when the rate of mortality among children under-five was 14% of the world's rate, having risen to 43% by 2000 (Niang 2008: 11) .",

            "text": "The IMF structural adjustment programs (SAPs) have been seen as a double-edge sword. Because of their now proven harmful side, Paul Farmer has called them \"structural violence,\" given their negative impact on the \"poverty and poor health outcomes\" (Spielberg and Adams 2011: 11). According to Farmer, SAPs are barriers preventing individuals from exercising their rights such as the right to education and health, especially when \"the individual is not at fault; rather, social forces, historical processes, and their resulting legacies constrain the individual.\" Then, he adds: \"Structural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress\" (Farmer 2001) . In Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland, for example, life expectancy at birth was reduced to 35 years, during the 1980-1990 period, the worst years of the health crisis in Africa-according to UNAIDS-as a result of structural adjustments and the HIV/AIDS epidemics. During that time, Africa also lost 544 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 people, more than twice the loss in India, due to disability, death, or ill health. In 1992, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Ghana accepted the structural adjustment or conditionalities from the IMF and imposed user fees (also known as co-payments, co-financing, and cost-recovery). As a result, government subsidies to health in Zimbabwe decreased by 14% between 1990 and 1992, and then by 29% during 1992 and 1993 . The health budget decreased by 50% hitting pre-natal and delivery health care the hardest. In Kenya, external patients' consultations decreased by 40%, especially affecting treatment of those suffering from sexually transmitted diseases. Ghana did not do as bad, and became the model for the adjustment programs. Some studies show that the standard of living in Africa fell by 2 per year between 1990 and 2008, to a level lower than it was in the early 1960s and 1970s. Unemployment became a major problem everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa and the buying power of Africans declined in real terms. Africa's debt grew tenfold between 1970 and 2008. These factors were a major reason for the collapse of many African health \"systems, as much of the workforce migrated to the West or other parts of Africa; the health policies did not center on communities, especially the poor; education suffered from reduction in social spending; many of the colonial models, which stressed changing individual behavior, were unfit to Africa's needs, as they did not reflect the African context, with infrastructure that overwhelmingly favored the cities. While roads were built on the European model, linking primarily productive centers, they neglected the countryside. Obviously, they did not take into account that most Africans were pedestrians, and that humans and cows, for example, constantly crisscrossed them at the same time. The 1978 enthusiasm for Alma-Ata, which was supposed to build enduring infrastructures to ensure health for all by 2000, began to dissipate during the 1990s; the health workforce began to be slashed, as was the case in Senegal, where it decreased from 5,904 in 1989 to 4,886 in 1995; and budgets were cut in almost all of Africa, reaching lower levels than was the case during the 1960s and 1970s.",

Globalization, a term coined in the 1970s, is a buzzword today but the controversy over its impact on the developing world continues to rage both among the rich and the educated and among the poor and the vulnerable populations of the globe. The very definition of the term is controversial, and it often depends on the ideology of the definer from one end of the spectrum to that of the receiver. Listening to one of the most known experts in the concept of globalization, Labonte, might help the reader understand the pertinent issues. Labonte (2011) says: \"Globalization, defined at its simplest, describes the constellation of processes by which nations, business and people are becoming more connected and interdependent across the globe through increased economic and communication exchange, culture diffusion (especially Western) and travel.\" This definition already connotes a one-sided direction of the movement, as it stresses the influence of Western \"civilization\" and culture over the developing, non-Western world. Labonte amplifies his point by stressing the importance of a free flow of capital, goods and services which, according to some, should lead to global equality and liberty, and the spread of new ideas and technologies. These would, in turn, spur global economic growth. The benefits of the process would trickle down to the poor and the rich simultaneously.",

They define globalization as: Economic globalization has been the fundamental force behind the overall process of globalization over the last two decades. It has been characterized both by a dramatic growth in the volume of cross-border flows and by major changes in their nature. International trade has grown at an accelerated pace-nearly 8.6 percent per year over the period 1990-1999-with the proportion accounted for by services increasing steadily, reaching nearly 19 percent in 1999. However, this transformation has largely by-passed low income countries, most of which remain critically dependent on aid flows. (Woodward et al. 2001) The last statement in the preceding definition or description of globalization constitutes the crux of the matter for those who believe globalization is unidirectional, moving unevenly from North to South. To counterbalance the two perspectives, Rennen and Martens have provided a definition that perhaps is more acceptable, as it incorporates the components of globalization in all spheres of life, including health, which hinges on what the UN called in 2005 \"the determinants of health.\" The two experts see \"contemporary globalization as intensification of cross-national cultural, economic, social, and technological interactions that lead to the establishment of transnational structures and the integration of cultural, economic, environmental, political and social process of global, supranational, national, regional, and local levels\" (Rennen and Martins 2003) .",

Out of their meetings came the two financial institutions, which have so much power and economic influence today. Carbajal and Levya hold the view that globalization is \"the tendency of markets and enterprises to increase themselves, reaching a global dimension which transcends national boundaries,\" implying that it is essentially an economic process, propelled by advances in technology and communication, whose result is a hegemonic hold of the world through control over the global market by major corporations and power hungry monopolistic businessmen and their political allies. Analysts of globalization point also to the fact that health and people's livelihoods are determined by the distribution of resources, such as hegemonic economic political power and asset ownership at both the global and local levels, which are all influenced by policy choices that tend to marginalize the powerless and the poor (WHO 2003) , while simultaneously siphoning the natural resources the latter might have to offer and its needs.",

The end result is the existence of the extreme inequalities and the absolute poverty seen in Africa today. The IMF, for example, has been accused of forcing Africa to accept its structural adjustment programs and slash social programs, such as education and health, freeze or reduce civil servants' salaries, and devalue the currencies, while dictating the terms of the use of the loans provided. To the claim that globalization would result in the leveling off of the playing field, Bozorgmeher once wrote (2010) that \"globality links people in the world but it does not follow that it connects people everywhere.\"",

Richer countries, such as the US, the UK, and Canada, just to name a few, have made the conditions so easy to transfer the workforce from Africa to the West as a result of essentially two elements: Their political and economic prowess, which often depends on resources stolen from the developing world itself such as Africa, and their disregard for the impact the workforce flight has on the health of the people, who have no recourse. Besada notes that: Globalization also has had far-reaching implications for health systems in Africa. By intensifying the economic and racial interconnectivity between countries, it has provided more employment opportunities for health care workers and greater integration of health care services, exchange of medical information, transfer of skills, information medical products and standards of practices as well as resources and avenues for responding to challenges in the health sector. (Bessada 2013: 211-212) He then adds: However, it is not the prevalence but the scale of this dynamic that grabs attention. There is nothing intrinsically new about the movement of health professionals from poor to rich countries. High level experts have always been internationally mobile, regardless of their country of origin. What is new is the emergence of an international healthcare labor market that provides increased opportunities for an ever larger number of health professionals from poor countries to seek mobility in response to pull factors on the demand side and pull factors on the supply side. (Bessada 2013: 211-212) The fallacy of the argument is double-edged: First of all, the fact that this movement has been happening for some time now as a result of globalization does not make it right. The flight of thousands of doctors and nurses annually deprives Africa not only of its critical workforce but it also occurs at the expense of the millions of dollars spent to educate these disappearing saviors of Africa's sick. Second, the question to be asked is: At whose expense does the Western countries' profit occur? The answer is clear: The Africans, whose resources have been stolen for over two centuries and continue to be siphoned using novel ways of the \"exploitation of man by man,\" to borrow Karl Marx's explanation of the differences between the rich and the poor, the oppressed and the oppressors.",

Many critics of unscrupulous globalization point to its intrinsic selfish nature that seeks nothing but profit, begotten at all cost, with man exploiting man by using extreme individualistic capitalism imposed on societies that tend to be more community-oriented, as is the case in Africa, which is symbolically underscored by the adage \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and the extended family relations that serve as a cushion of support during hard times. To Africa, globalization has brought the following realities: the prominence of sport over intellectual learning and achievement; the glorification of gruesome scenes of violence; the glamour of sex; the reckless and deadly vehicle driving constantly shown in movies theaters; the revival of racial and ethnic slurs that demean minorities; the sensational portrayal of genocide and internment of those who are physically or racially different from the majority; and tolerance of a completely subversive trend that destroys precious family life and intimacy through constant use of communication devices that seek instant gratification.",

Indeed, pharmaceuticals continue to claim further exclusive rights before the WTO and governments, as was the case of Merck & Co and 39 other American pharmaceutical corporations in South Africa that went to court to defend their \"rights\" to prohibit the government from importing cheap drugs. They finally dropped the suit in 2001, after realizing that this was allowed by the international courts. In the context of globalization, the issue of generic drugs is extremely relevant to the struggle for medical autonomy on the part of the traditional healers in Africa. We have been led to believe that competition and globalization would bring the prices of drugs down. This has not, however, been the case in the developing world. In Kenya, for example, the prices of antiretroviral therapy medication and treatment have gone down from $10,000 to $100 a year through the use of generic drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB, but only through the insistence of philanthropic organizations such as the Clinton Foundation, and governments,. These were instrumental in shaming their conduct and forcing them to think about humanity rather than profitability at all cost.",

To remedy the situation on behalf of the Africans, says the WHO, Africa needs to have its own manufacturers so it can produce its own vaccines and essential drugs and continue to provide what the European partners have been able to take and deliver from \"top down\" (see Tumusiime et al. 2012: 1-6) .",

Yet, globalization's ugly side is choking the developing world, though often covertly. The replacement of man with machine without the retraining of workers, for example, has created high unemployment, despair, and the destruction of the nuclear family everywhere. Thus, to combat the nefarious impact of globalization-with its tendency to accumulate capital and wealth, and its thirst for control over the means of production that relegates the poor to the lowest denominator as humans while gobbling everything that comes its way-some anti-globalists have come up with the concept of \"global public goods.\" A global public good is meant to be protected by all enterprises, nationalities, institutions, communities, races, organizations, and even the corporations themselves that could not care less about their activities on the globe, which they see as nothing but an exhaustible pool of resources and cheap labor. As one analyst puts it, instead of being a public good or a means to it, globalization has brought us a mixture of \"global conflicts, global warming, international financial stability, and growing poverty\" (Ersoy 2011: 225) affecting people \"across regions and countries, across rich and poor populations,\" as well as \"peace and security, health, market efficiency [sometimes], human rights, and knowledge.\" Global public goods have also been known as \"global collective goods\" or \"international public goods.\"",

In this sense, therefore, public good is \"non-rival\" in the sense that it is a good that can be consumed by one individual, but one without diminishing \"obtain-ability\u2026for consumption by another individual;\" a public good enjoys \"non-excludability,\" meaning that \"no one can be excluded from using it\" (Cornes and Sandler 1996) .\" In contrast, therefore, to redeem itself, what globalization should do is to expand and increase public goods on the globe. Ersoy elaborates his point by adding that global public goods aim at \"creating an effect on both regional and international levels, sometimes even when they have characteristics of semi-public goods, club goods, etc.\" This approach will ensure that globalization works to the benefit of all peoples of the globe, poor and rich, sick and healthy, vulnerable, and socially insecure.",

This might be achieved through global taxation on banks all over the globe to alleviate those global health problems that require \"global responses,\" as the concept of public good and approaches require \"the crucial requirement for global collective action\" and agreement on new \"fundamental principles\" of action (Ersoy 2011: 236) .

If we assume that 100 people are living on earth, 57 of them are Asians, 21 are Europeans, 8 are Africans, 6 are Americans; 48 are men and 52 are women; 30 are white and 70 are non-white; 30 are Christians and 70 are non-Christians. On the other hand, 6 people own 50 percent of the community wealth and they are all North Americans. Eighty live in poverty 70 cannot read, 30 die in famine, 1 has a higher education and 1 has a computer. It is obvious that power and resources do not seem to follow the majority/minority pattern of the world population, i.e., globalization has failed until now to democratically represent the world it has claimed to globalize. (Okasa 2005) Usually, under the structural adjustment programs, any temporary economic gains vanish quickly as they cannot be sustained for a longer sweep of time. A study conducted by Behrman et al. in 2000 in 18 Latin American countries affected by globalization found great imbalances in the distribution of incomes that resulted in higher inequalities in 13 cases. The worse result was attributed to the liberalization of international finance followed by domestic financial liberalization and tax reform adopted to attract foreign investments. The study also found that outsourcing, practiced by the major corporations, weakens \"collective bargaining, minimum wages, and safety at work\" (WHO 2011). Even the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been linked to globalization and its unintended results. Kunitz views HIV/ AIDS as \"a product of contemporary globalization [and] the precursor of the epidemic,\" because this disease, he argues, \"erupted simultaneously with, and was exacerbated by, the economic crisis that engulfed many poor countries, especially in Africa in the 1980s. That crisis had measurable demographic effects beyond those attributed to HIV and AIDS, and though they were not AIDS-related, they prepared fertile ground in which disease could take root\" (Kunitz 2007: 181) . In their volume titled Medicine, Mobility, and Power in Global Africa, editors Hansjorg Dilger, Abdoulaye Kane, and Stacey A. Lamgwick have a unique and interesting perspective on globalization. So far, most scholars have looked at it as a one-way street, benefiting only the West and those with power, what they have called \"push and pull factors.\"",

In their view, the new migratory flow is contributing to the amalgamation of new global consumers, syncretic medicines, new treatments, new clinics, new entrepreneurs in the health business, new and transformed healers, and the use of new specialized medical services such as in vitro fertilization. Thus, many healing practices in Africa are being transported to the new national and international domiciles by migrants and health professionals, who, even though abroad, continue to be fed health-wise by the traditional medical practices they were accustomed to, bringing, in the process, new clients, and new curious practitioners. These transformations are the result of the flow of migration and impact of new \"ideas, goods, images, flows of money, and people between poor(er) and rich(er) countries,\" brought about by globalization. In this process, Africans bring with them, without regard to borders, their cache of immemorially sanctioned medical practices in the form of \"herbs, pills, blessed waters, prayers, audiocassettes of holy scripture recitations\" (Dilger et al. 2012) , say the authors.",

Even though this is a refreshing look at Africa's participation in the globalization movement that includes health and medicine, it leaves many questions unanswered. Who, for example, is the primary agent of the movement? Is the migration of health professionals to African countries, such as South Africa, or to the Western world? What is the level of the syncretic nature of new treatments, if not that which affects only the migrants primarily, as they continue the practices they brought with them? Who is able to compete meaningfully in the new order? Who comes up with inventions, and the initiatives for technological change? Is it driven by the migrants or the nationals of the new domicile in the Diaspora? How do herbalists, for instance, influence the international or global community? If Africa is not the place of gaps and marginalization, is poverty increased or decreased by the migratory flow?

Unfortunately, the colonialists were right in the sense that scientists have shown that unhygienic practices and behaviors can ruin and, indeed, have ruined many of the efforts put forth to provide quality care that prevents disease or contributes to good health. However, where the colonialists erred was, first, to believe that hygiene, such as hand washing, bathing daily, washing one's face, cleaning the home, refusing to shake hands of people who appeared unclean, and disposing waste properly, were the panacea to good health and prevention of all diseases, of which they said Africans were not aware or simply refused to accept the scientific dicta. The second problem was that their health concepts and strategies did not match their actions in their daily interaction with the Africans. A definition of the concepts of sanitation and hygiene might help here. The WHO notes that sanitation is a word that \"generally refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and feces. The word 'sanitation' [the definition continues] also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal\" (WHO 2014a, b) . Hygiene is a broader word which The Dictionary defines as \"any practice or activity that you do to keep things healthy and clean. Washing hands, coughing into your elbow and regular house cleaning are all part of good hygiene.\" Provision of water and latrines to African homes, cleaning up dilapidated structures that attract all kinds of insects, reptiles, and rodents, well-conceived and constant lessons about the importance of hygiene for the maintenance of public health were never European priorities. The way the British themselves described the health facilities in Kenya and Uganda is elucidating: Some were appalling, notably the Native Civil Hospital in Nairobi, established for the workers who built the Uganda Railway, condemned in 1904, but not replaced until 1922 owing to dispute over where to locate the town's African quarter. In 1913, the Governor called this hospital 'the filthiest sight he has seen since he came\u2026Apart from old and unsuitable buildings, disgusting bedding, no hot water, its use as the municipal morgue, and a staff who worked only during office hours, 'the Nursing of the hospital is likely done by boys engaged off the street in the same way one engages a house boy and teaches him his duties. (Quoted in Iliffe 1998: 3) In order words, Europeans were highly critical of the Africans but provided few facilities and means to uplift the fate of their health. Education and cultural sensitivity were often missing in the effort to introduce good practices of behavior for the prevention of disease.",

In 2014, the 18 countries studied needed 25.5 million latrines for a population of 489 million to maintain the required sanitary conditions, while the annual cost of open defecation has been estimated at $2.0 billion, affecting mostly women who are primarily responsible for the health of the household (Hickling and Hutton 2014: 31) . The emphasis on hygiene, cleanliness, provision of clean water, and the teaching of African children since primary school about health issues ought to be one of African leaders' top priorities today.",

Sadly, when one visits the African villages, he or she is appalled by the prevailing unacceptable state of hygiene among children and even adults, which prompts one to ask how these conditions are tolerated in the twenty-first century. Children play and grow in a depressing and depressed environment, one that could be changed without requiring too many resources, except awareness campaigns and water provision where there may be no rivers, springs, or lakes. In 2014, funds allocated to sanitation across the whole continent amounted to less than 0.1% of GDP (Hickling 2014: 29) . It has also been found through research and experience that people who have toilets behave better hygienically than those who do not. Unfortunately, other studies have also demonstrated that poor sanitation and poor hygiene are associated with a host of frequently occurring diseases such as diarrhea. It is unacceptable that Africa would still remain \"the only region in the world where diarrhea is the leading cause of child mortality and where promotion of sanitation and hygiene offers a cost-effective means of tackling this\" (Hickling and Hutton 2014: 26) .",

Evidence of fecal contamination was also found in kitchens, again on surfaces thought likely to be involved in the transmission of feces (taps and soap dispenser). (Curtis et al. 2003) The WHO has been clear about the close association between maternal and child mortality and the state of water, hygiene, and sanitation. This is particularly critical in the developing world. The situation is aggravated by the fact that child deliveries in Africa, most of which are done by traditional midwives, occurs in a home milieu that often lacks water or clean water and latrines or toilets for both mother and the midwife, which has led to continuous preventable infections. The health facilities are also a problem, as 38% of them do not have water, do not have hygienic practices, and where sanitary conditions are extremely poor. Thus, in 2013, the WHO adds, 289,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth, even though the mortality rates have decreased by 50% between 1994 and 2014 (Mis, Rueters 2014: 1) .",

First, may be the topography: lack of rivers and lakes, dry areas, and colonial legacy, which concentrated its attention on the cities where the white colonial population lived, modeled after the European towns of the time.

Thus, the difference between town and country is 37% for the former and 17% for the latter (Yaya 2010: 98) . Another is lack of better organization and the selection of the best department for water and sanitation. Virtually each African state has its own allocation of this responsibility, from the Department of Public Works as during the colonial period to the Ministry of Transportation, Mines, and Telecommunications (in Cameroon), the Ministry of Urban Planning and Housing and Ministry of Water, and Ministry of Public Health (in Chad), the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Ministry of Public Works (in Liberia) (See Yaya 2010: 106-107). Wars have been devastating in that they have not only killed people but also destroyed health, sanitation, and water infrastructures, as has been the case in Cote d'Ivoire, where 70% of its health infrastructure has been destroyed by the civil war. Poor data availability has also been named one of the major obstacles, as no rational decisions can be made without assessment of needs, and the recorded actual conditions on the ground, and fair or equitable distribution of resources and infrastructure projects.",

            "text": "concluSIon Corruption and lack of freedom, important components of Africa's political economy, have undoubtedly slowed Africa's march towards providing improved health care to its citizens. The promise of democracy in Africa is seen by every analyst as a sham. Indeed, despite a stream of (phony) elections, the same governments have continued to govern in a corrupt and repressive environment for decades; where the national resources are plundered and distributed among the privileged few; where literacy rates are low or average; and where women are still discriminated against and treated as second class citizens, with little to say on issues of domestic health and where they cannot negotiate their status. Above all, how-ever, leaders must understand that it is essential to realize that health systems are more than health care; that they also include efforts in disease prevention, health promotion, and advocacy for policies that address health concerns; that \"improved health contributes to social wellbeing through its impact on economic development, competitiveness and productivity and that a high-performing health system is a key contributor to this process\"' (ECOSOC 2009: 21-22) . Others point out that, despite the challenges Africa faces in health, it has advantages that it did not have many decades ago, namely, preventive methods, accurate diagnostics, and the most effective treatments. What the leaders need to do, of course, is to make the needed resources available and use \"the mechanisms necessary to deploy them appropriately to resolve the critical challenge of access [to health] and equity\" (Yaya and Ileka-Priouzeau 2010: 66) . On equity, the two authors (2010: 68) note that \"la fonction et la qualit\u00e9 principales d'un syst\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 r\u00e9sident dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 assurer une \u00e9galit\u00e9 d'Access, que celle-ci soit financi\u00e8re, g\u00e9ographique ou autre, a des soins de qualit\u00e9 pour l'ensemble des collectivit\u00e9s.\" In other words, for a health system to function optimally, it must have the ability to provide equal access to the citizens, be it in the form of finances or geographic location.",

We need to tame it and make it work for the good of all societies, thus, the merit of the concept of \"global public good.\" Indeed, as this author has argued in the past, \"If globalization is properly managed, it can advance the state of the health systems globally and people's health but only if the domestic markets are truly competitive, regulatory institutions strong, asset concentration moderate, and unfettered access to public health equalized and widespread, if social safety nets are in place for everyone, and the rules of access to global markets are non-exclusionary\" (Azevedo and Johnson 2011: 178) . Only then, as says one analyst, \"can globalization reduce opportunistic behavior, operate economies of scale [fairly], reward efforts and entrepreneurship, improve employment opportunities [for all able members of society], raise earnings, and reduce the price of consumer goods,\" while combating inequalities and extreme or absolute poverty on the globe we share. Studies have shown that unscrupulous globalization efforts have ruined the lives of farmers in many regions of the world, as happened during the 1990s in Zambia, Chile, the Philippines, and Ghana. Zambia, for example, unable to compete on the world market, lost 30,000 jobs and 132 of its 140 textile mills, which resulted in the loss of 40% of manufacturing jobs within eight years from encouragement by the World Bank to open its borders to cheap textile imports.",

Parsitau, as most critics have done, argues that maternal and infant mortality spiked during the 1980s from both the economic recession and the SAPs, a conclusion that is upheld by UNICEF. Many health facilities, clinics and health centers had to close as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions and with the distance to the hospital being on average, 6-7 kilometers pregnant women and mothers found it difficult to meet their health needs. As a result of the co-payments, expecting mothers at Nakuru District Hospital in Kenya were now required to purchase and bring \"gloves, surgical blades, disinfectants and syringes in preparation for childbirth\u2026In addition, they [had] to bribe hospital personnel in order to be attended to\" (Parsitau 2008: 195) .

At the National Kenyatta Hospital, the largest in the country, user fees were introduced in 2004 and this, along with less access to other health facilities and quality health care and nutrition, worsened poverty and the impact of HIV/AIDS in the country. The study revealed that life expectancy at birth fell rapidly and visits to the hospital were dramatically reduced. The SAPs in Kenya and in most countries that received IMF loans aggravated the situation women face in Africa, \"who are already stressed, overworked, depressed, and generally unhealthy\" (Parsitau 2008: 198) -not to mention those that are abused, and where male children are preferred over female children for school, clothing, food, and careers outside the home, most notably in the rural areas. This situation can only be blamed on the leadership, whose priorities lie elsewhere both regarding the health of women and young girls, made loudly clear in the way the so-called scarce resources are allocated nationally.",

The problem with the schemes being experimented with in Africa today-which combine or single out public, private, commer-cial, philanthropic, traditional, and informal health insurance providers-is that they are ineffective and confusing. This causes problems to the ability of the health sector to fulfill the health needs of the insured and noninsured citizens, ending up by shortchanging the poor, the vulnerable, and those who are the least influential members of society. This occurs in a poorly conceived health system that cannot cover or expand its resources to ensure the availability of and access to most health services, such as immunization, adequate birth attendance, and maternal and child morbidity and mortality prevention programs. It has been demonstrated that \"neonates represent about 40% of children who die before their fifth birthday and that 20% neonatal deaths globally occur in Africa. The African Region's neonatal mortality is the highest in the world\" (WHO African Region Health Report 2013: 19). In sum, Africans need to conceive and implement effective and efficient national health models that protect the health of all its citizens, especially mothers and children. It is clear, however, that countries' presidents and heads of state, government ministers, health ministry secretaries, and most high level civil servants have no problem covering the health costs. Why is this so? Who foots their bill, and where do the resources come from? The answer is self-evident. Obviously, all these problems are exacerbated by the high levels of poverty that plague the whole continent of Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of the nature of the colonial system experienced, and notwithstanding the available resources that could cut by half the index of people's misery.",

It is in this arena and in that of maternal and child care that the continent has the chance to turn things around for the better. Thus, despite all the natural environmental and social obstacles, Africa can do better. Understanding this does not require a rocket scientist or a Ph.D. in environmental studies: It requires only common sense and sensitivity to the lives of people that have been entrusted to us. Put differently, the intolerable state of hygiene and lack of awareness of its importance for the prevention of disease rests solely on the shoulders of the leaders, given that, in most cases, the resources for providing the basic means to at least 90% of the citizens, including those living in the villages, are there. The same remarks can be made of the sewage systems in Africa and the waste that is found undisposed of in many towns and cities. However, for the change to happen, leaders must be reminded constantly of the awful conditions under which people live and realize the number of lives the lack of sanitation and hygiene ruins. Likewise, one does not need to have a degree in public health and economics to understand that, financially, prevention is always better in the long-run than trying to take action when epidemics, such as cholera or meningitis, hit a population. Over 144 studies conducted during the 1990s and earlier revealed that, if water supplies and sanitary conditions are sufficiently improved, diarrheal mortality would be reduced by 50 to 80%-of course, \"depending on the types of intervention and the presence of risk factors such as poor feeding practices and maternal literacy\" (WB, Better Health 1994: 31).",

However, this must be done with extreme sensitivity, as is the case of trying to eliminate defecation in open air, which involves issues of privacy, stigma, important cultural norms, and the concept of human dignity (Patkan and Goshing 2014: 42) . One example might perhaps serve as inspiration for many African countries. To improve sanitation and hygiene, immediately after Zimbabwe became independent, the leaders created the Ministry of Rural Resources and Water Development, allocating some Z$1.3 billion in 1997-1998, which became an important sign and symbol that the leaders saw the importance of programs designed to improve the lives of people who did not live in the cities and towns. This made a major difference in the lives of the Zimbabweans across the country. Unfortunately, as a result of civil unrest and unwise economic and social policies, Zimbabwe's health system has virtually collapsed and people's living standards deteriorate by the day.",

Changing habits, as we know, is always difficult and even painful, especially if they are firmly engrained in a culture-one reason why many heads of households sometimes refuse to use a commode or a latrine even when available. It is good to remember that, in most of Africa, a father-in-law, for example, would not leave his bodily waste in the same spot as his son-in-law and would feel uncomfortable, as well, to live in a house whose dining area and a latrine are built side by side, even if separated by a wall. It appears that, as a result of the pledges to reach the MDGs by 2015, African countries are becoming more and more aware of the need for a sound waste management system and water improvement. In addition, international agencies are contributing both to awareness and to the actual provision of systems that are helping Africa come out of its long history of neglect of the health aspect of the issue at hand. Sanitation neglect has made Africa the worse continent on water improvement and provision of a clean environment that is conducive to health, longevity, and proper disposal of human, industrial, and animal waste.",

Even though it is a cop out to blame colonialism for the health ills of the continent today, its legacy cannot and should not be ignored, though many analysts tend to develop amnesia about most that befell Africans for over a century. The impact of the ghost of colonialism, as discussed in this volume, is clearly reflected in the colonial health models that are still being followed in Africa's medical, academic, and professional schools, including legal training and constitutional frameworks. Colonial health models have failed to examine and take into account all factors and root causes that led to unending epidemics and the impact of famines and thinking patterns that continue to curse Africa. Even when discussing the HIV/AIDS pandemic that hit Africa harder than any other continent at the beginning of the 1980s, researchers and health practitioners, both African and non-African, were nothing but pseudoexperts and scientists who, imbued of a colonial mentality, were quick to point the finger at Africa's promiscuity as a major reason for its spread on the continent and failed to examine some of the historical roots of the crisis, which included: the plundering of the African productive lands for over 100 years, thus causing numerous famines particularly during the 1880s-1920s, rendering Africans' immune system weaker; the migratory movement caused by colonially forced dislocation; the rapid changes that impacted sexual mores; poverty that made women and children more vul-nerable to predatory men of money and power; deterioration of the state of hygiene, a condition that can easily help spread infectious diseases; the increased level of prostitution to satisfy the lust of international travelers; and the legacy of armed colonial men that fought wars in Africa and abroad in World War I and World War II, all of which enhanced the spread of sexually transmitted venereal diseases. As a result, the long presence of a higher number of venereal diseases and other infections was responsible for the quick spread of HIV/AIDS, as shown by experts such as Kunitz, who wrote:",

This burden not only contributed to ill health but also compromised the immune system, \"poverty, and undernourishment [and malnourishment], which facilitated recurrent epidemics of measles and whooping cough and other diseases right up to 1945. The epidemics resulted in high infant mortality,\" as was the case with the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic, which the Nyamwezi jokingly called \"bom bom because the explosive cough reminded them of the noise of the cannon\" (Ranger 1992: 262) . What explains the fact that, while measles has virtually been eradicated throughout the world, Africa stills experiences many local epidemics? Indeed, while from 2000 to 2001, the number of deaths from measles worldwide was reduced from 542,000 to 158,000, respectively (Medecins Sans Frontieres 2014), the dead toll continued to plague the continent of Africa. In sum, to understand the state of health in Africa today requires a careful and comprehensive analysis of all risks, past and present, to which the continent has been subjected, including a highly erratic and selfish type of leadership, quite often imposed on the Africans and supported by the West, as has been the case in Chad, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea.
