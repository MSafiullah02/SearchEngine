It causes lower acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) especially in infants less than 2 years old (Ghietto et al., 2015, Martin et al., 2009, Meriluoto et al., 2012), and the frequency of detection varies from 1% to 33% (Bicer et al., 2013, Garcia-Garcia et al., 2008, Ghietto et al., 2012b, Martin et al., 2009). Severe cases are associated with high viral load, anti-HBoV1 IgM antibody detection or an increase in the levels of IgG antibodies, comorbidity and age (Christensen et al., 2010, Ghietto et al., 2015, Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2010). A longitudinal study of children from infancy to puberty documented a clear association of primary HBoV1 infection with respiratory symptoms (Meriluoto et al., 2012). All of that strongly supports the etiological role of HBoV1 in ARTI.",

The patients from whom the clinical specimens were obtained were 9 and 10 years old and were hospitalized due to lower respiratory tract illness. They were hemoculture negative and also negative by molecular method (real time RT-PCR) for other common respiratory viruses, such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, -2 and -3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus (Ghietto et al., 2015). HBoV1 was confirmed by sequencing [Gen' database accession numbers JX034732 and JN632491 (Ghietto et al., 2012b, Ghietto et al., 2015)]. Fifty-\u00b5l respiratory secretion was diluted in 500 \u00b5l Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (GIBCO) with penicillin-streptomycin, centrifuged 3 min at 1000g and filtered.

DEAE-dextran is a polycationic derivative of the carbohydrate polymer dextran. It was one of the first chemical reagents used to transfer nucleic acids into cultured mammalian cells (Vaheri and Pagano, 1965) and has been used to enhance the growth of other viruses such as coronaviruses, rubella, and picornaviruses. Postinoculation temperatures of incubation were 33 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. Previous studies described that respiratory viruses replicated slightly better at 33 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C, since the lower temperature seems to replicate the conditions in the upper respiratory tract (Gangl et al., 2015, Papadopoulos et al., 1999). Three independent repetitions of infection assays were performed in 60 mm-Petri dishes. During the optimization of DEAE-dextran concentration to be used in the culture, we observed cytotoxicity and decreased cell survival in the control and infected cultures supplemented with 10 \u00b5g/ml DEAE-dextran. Consequently, the assays with DEAE-dextran were performed at 1 \u00b5g/ml.",

We demonstrate infection by detecting HBoV1 genome in the attached cells and in the supernatant medium of the cultures 1\u20136 dpi), a raise in the concentration of viral DNA, and a unique pattern of immunofluorescence using pooled policlonal antibodies, which evidences the proteins of the virus in the replication sites (1 and 4 dpi). In addition, we corroborated the virus DNA replicated by sequencing the viral genome detected in the supernatant and in the monolayer. In spite of HBoV1 replication in Caco-2 cells after inoculation of respiratory material, the viral progeny is not capable of subsequent infection cycles. This might be an outcome of different and possibly overlapping mechanisms of virus-cell interactions, including mutations in the progeny genome that have a profound effect in the viral protein functions, namely the virus entry and genome replication. Overall, these results can provide insights into the observations that HBoV1 can be detected in human tissues other than the respiratory epithelium (Gunel et al., 2015, Norja et al., 2012, Schildgen et al., 2013). In Caco-2 cell cultures infected with HBoV1 and supplemented with DEAE-dextran (1 \u00b5g/ml) at 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C, the presence of HBoV1 was observed in the supernatants and the cells attached to the substrate from 1 to 6 dpi, in contrast to cultures maintained with standard EMEM (Table 1 and Fig. 3A and B). As a confirmation that the virus enters in these cells, the same procedures applied to Vero cultures, used as a reference since it has been documented previously that HBoV1 does not replicate in this cells line (Huang et al., 2012), do not result in detection of the viral DNA (Table 1 and Fig. 3C). Immunofluorescence assays confirmed HBoV1 infection in Caco-2 culture supplemented with DEAE-dextran (Fig. 5). Scattered foci of a spotted pattern located in the periphery of the nucleus and nuclear membrane was consistently observed in infected monolayers at 24 and 96 hpi. This picture was not detected in the uninfected cultures and furthermore, the primary antibody capture assays prevented it (Fig. 6). Since the capture assays were performed with supernatant medium and lysates from attached cells of infected cultures, these assays not only confirm the HBoV1 immunofluorescence pattern but also the presence of neutralizing viral particles and/or proteins in the cultures. Regarding the fluorescence pattern, our findings agree with those of Schildgen and coworkers (Schildgen et al., 2013), who described a FISH analysis on tumor tissue samples and on transfected HepG2 cells with probes targeting the regions near the left and right end hairpins. From their assays, the authors depict a perinuclear specific fluorescence in both types of samples; in addition, in tumor tissues the staining pattern was heterogeneous: some samples had a single hairpin signal per infected cell, while multiple signals were detected in other samples, suggestive of chronic or latent HBoV1 infection congruent with a model of replication in a focal manner.",

After that, the viral genome remained high and relatively constant for the period that the experiment lasted (6 days, Fig. 3A). These results evidence a viral replication cycle of rapid development, even when the cells are differentiated (enterocyte type, Fig. 4) and match the data obtained by other authors using HAE-ALI cell cultures, which show an increase in the viral titer during the first 72 hpi when inoculated at a high MOI (Deng et al., 2014). In contrast, at 33 \u00b0C (a temperature close to that in the upper airway tract) the virus replication apparently is delayed and HBoV1 DNA is detected in the supernatant later, compared to 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 3B). While this might only represent an effect of the lower metabolic rate of Caco-2 cells at 33 \u00b0C, it is important to note that HBoV1 still replicates in this condition. Thus, it is worth investigating if these findings correlate with the capacity of the virus to produce both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as comparing the genome sequences of viruses isolated from upper and lower tract. It has been shown that a single amino acid change in PB2 protein of H5N1 Influenza virus can confer the advantage for efficient growth in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Hatta et al., 2007). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the ability to replicate in different conditions and tissues might be related to the pathogenesis of HBoV1.",

However, the results of blind passages of supernatants and monolayers indicate that the infection in Caco-2 cells is limited. In addition to this, the assays with differentiated Caco-2 cells indicate that the virus is not release to the supernatant and the viral genome is detected only in the monolayer after 28 dpi and at very low concentration. Since the viral genome and proteins can be detected in the supernatant medium and cells of the initial cultures of these series but both fail to infect a new culture, it can also be inferred that the viral progeny contains no infective particles. Different and non-excluding mechanisms could explain those outcomes.",

            "text": "On the one hand, the action of the cell-autonomous innate immune system response could be limiting and controlling the infection. Type I interferons (IFN) are induced by simultaneous multiple ways that allow the cells to detect virus infection (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). Caco-2 cells have a functional IFN system (Cuadras et al., 2002, Guix et al., 2015). HBoV1 innate immune response: it has been shown that the VP2 protein induces the expression of IFN-\u03b2 by physically interacting with the negative regulator RNF125 (Luo et al., 2013). Conversely, another report shows that the NP1 protein has the ability to inhibit activation of IFN-\u03b2 by preventing the binding of transcription factor IRF-3 with the corresponding promoter (Zhang et al., 2012). Although the puzzle is not complete, these data provide an example of how HBoV1 can activate and influence the balance in IFN production. IFN action could even justify the pattern of scattered foci of infected cells that we observed in immunofluorescence tests (Fig. 5). In a scenario that is common to many viruses (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008), we could speculate that NP1 and VP2 proteins of HBoV1 alternately affect IFN synthesis in the target tissue for the benefit of the virus: first to delay apoptosis (which reportedly prevents the generation of virus progeny) and later to accelerate the release and dissemination of new virus particles to susceptible cells. These mechanisms suggest a preponderant role of IFN in the first cellular response to HBoV1 infection, which can be explored in Caco-2 cells.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the generation of defective interfering viral particles (DIVP) could also determine the fall of infective virus titer. DIVP were identified over 40 years ago (Huang and Baltimore, 1970, Lazzarini et al., 1981). They can result from errors in the polymerase enzyme activity when replicating nucleic acids, which can generate changes or deletions in genes important for virus assembly or for function of structural proteins resulting in problems in the interaction with the target cell. We attempted sequencing and comparing the entire genomes of the input virus and the progeny (in the monolayers and in the supernatants) at 6 dpi. It was not possible to sequence two segments (out of 8 overlapping fragments) corresponding to NS1 and VP1/VP2 proteins from the virus detected in the supernatants, probably due to a number of mutations in the sites of primer binding. However, we were able to obtain a complete genome sequence from the virus in the monolayers. Comparing the sequences obtained from the culture to the virus in the clinical specimen, we observed other 33 mutations located mostly in NS1 protein. We specifically detected a mutation that reverts to a stop codon, which results in a truncated NS1 protein (Table 2 and Fig. 7). This important number of changes at the end of the coding sequence bearing the helicase domain could explain, at least in part, the absence of infective viral progeny particles in our Caco-2 cultures. HBoV1 NS1 contains an N-terminal DNA binding/endonuclease domain, a central helicase domain, and a C-terminal zinc-finger domain (Chen et al., 2010, Dijkman et al., 2009, Shen et al., 2015), functions that account for non-structural protein NS1 key roles in the viral life cycle of parvoviruses, such as genome transcription, replication, and packaging (Cotmore and Tattersall, 2013). In addition, some authors observed that HBoV1 genome exists as head-to-tail monomer in infected tissues, which either reflects the likely evolution of alternative replication mechanism in primate bocaviruses or a mechanism of viral persistence (Kapoor et al., 2011, Lusebrink et al., 2011). It would be interesting to determine the presence of head-to-tail intermediates in the attached Caco-2 cells (of both, standard and differentiated cultures), as well as performing assays with clinical specimens pre-treated with DNase in order to ensure infection with viral particles and not free viral DNA. Together with the novel sequence information reported here, it would increase our understanding of HBoV1 infection and contribute to the future development of HBoV1 cell culture models.",
