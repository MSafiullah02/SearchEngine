The antibody is directed against the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The reported accuracy for the lateral flow immunoassay, were for IgG: specificity 98.0%, sensitivity 100%, accuracy 98.6%; for IgM: specificity 96.0%, sensitivity 85.0%; accuracy 92.9%. In addition, it was easy to perform and potentially applicable to rapid predonation screening. The test was read by two independent expert biologists, who had to reach an agreement, and considered positive when strong or weak immunoreactivity for IgG or IgM was detected, while very weak or dubious positive results were considered not specific. The serologic assay was validated by testing the plasma of 22 COVID-19 patients (confirmed by qRT-PCR) 10 days after they were hospitalized in Milan between February and March 2020 (positive controls). A total of 36 serum samples have been collected at different times from the onset of symptoms.
