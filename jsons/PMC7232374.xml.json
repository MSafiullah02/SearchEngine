            "text": "Viral macrodomains are small protein domains of about 15\u201320 kDa encoded within the nonstructural proteins of several RNA viruses. Computer-assisted comparisons of RNA viruses in the early 1990s identified a conserved region of known function in the polyproteins of the Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, Matonaviridae, and Hepeviridae families which was named the \u201cX\u201d domain [1,2]. Eventually, the \u201cX\u201d domain was renamed macrodomain based on the protein folding that appear to be similar to the \u201cmacro\u201d part of the macroH2A protein. The macrodomain is encoded within nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) of the coronaviruses and alphaviruses and within open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the rubella virus and hepatitis E virus. Several crystal structures of alphavirus and coronavirus macrodomains have been determined and demonstrate a highly conserved \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich fold [3,4]. The biochemical function of viral macrodomains were ambiguous until the discovery that viral macrodomains are enzymatically active and bind to poly- and mono-ADP-ribose [4,5,6,7]. Viral macrodomains were originally shown to have ADP-ribose-1\u201d-phosphatase activity, removing phosphate from ADP-ribose-1\u201d-phosphate. However, more recently, it has been demonstrated that they have hydrolase activity that removes ADP-ribose from proteins (Figure 1) [8,9].",

Additionally, it has been shown that ADP-ribose molecules can be added to nucleic acids [14]. The ADP-ribose is transferred from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) onto target proteins as a single molecule of ADP-ribose (mono-ADP-ribose (MAR)) [8] or as consecutive individual units to form polymers of ADP-ribose molecules (poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)) by ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTs) including the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) [15]. There are 17 known PARPs in the human genome, and more than half of them are induced by interferon (IFN), implicating ADP-ribose in the antiviral defense system. When IFN binds to its receptor, the IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), it initiates a signaling cascade that results in the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have antiviral activities. PARPs have many well-known pro- and antiviral activities (reviewed in Reference [16]). For instance, PARP12 is required for the ADP-ribosylation of Zika virus proteins NS1 and NS3 that inhibit Zika virus replication [17]. Conversely, PARP7 ADP-ribosylates TBK-1 which inhibits IFN production and leads to enhanced replication of influenza virus [18].",

Some of these enzymes hydrolyze a single unit of MAR, whereas the poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolases (PARGs) can remove polymers of ADP-ribose molecules at O-glycosidic bonds [20,21,22,23]. It has been described that these enzymes hydrolyze ADP-ribose from target proteins at specific amino acid positions [24]. Human macroD2 enzymes, for instance, remove ADP-ribose from MARylated proteins at glutamate-ADP-ribose linkages [20,21]. Sequence analysis of viral macrodomains place them in the macroD2 family (Figure 2) and suggests that de-MARylation may be the primary enzymatic activity of the viral macrodomains [8].",

It is yet unclear which of these activities play a dominant role during virus infections, but current data suggests that de-MARylation is their primary function. Data from McPherson et al., Abraham et al., and Fehr et al. support this idea as these studies demonstrated a correlation between de-MARylating activity and virus replication in cell culture and pathogenesis in vivo [25,26,27]. Also, the IFN-inducible PARPs are mono-ADP-ribosylating PARPs, again suggesting that viral macrodomains likely act to counter this antiviral response. However, it is also conceivable that MAR and PAR may work together in the antiviral response, as PARylation of Zika virus proteins has been observed, which is dependent on PARP12 activity. However, it is not clear how the MARylating activity of PARP12 is connected to the PARylation of Zika virus proteins [17].",

Most notably, the distal ribose is tightly coordinated by two distinct loop regions that are highly conserved. Loop 1 includes a highly conserved triple glycine motif that interacts with the \u03b1-phosphate and the 1\u201d and 2\u201d OH groups of the distal ribose. Loop 2 contains a highly conserved GIF (Coronaviruses (CoVs)) or GIY (Togaviruses) motif that primarily contacts the \u03b2-phosphate of ADP-ribose and provides van der Waals contacts to direct the orientation of the distal ribose. A recent NMR structure, which depicted ADP-ribose bound and unbound forms of the VEEV macrodomain, showed that these loops undergo a dramatic conformational shift upon encountering ADP-ribose [11]. This is especially true for loop 1, which moved close to 3\u212b during this transition. A highly conserved asparagine residue (N41 in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV) also appears to help coordinate the distal ribose, while an aspartic acid (D23 in SARS-CoV) provides hydrogen bonds to contact the amino group of the adenine. However, this aspartic acid is not completely conserved, as a serine or asparagine can provide these contacts in some alphaviruses (Figure 2).",

A mutation in loop 2 has been identified in both CHIKV and Sindbis virus (SINV), Y114A, that has reduced hydrolysis but increased ADP-ribose binding activity, indicating that this residue may be specifically important for hydrolysis. These mechanisms may not be identical between CoVs and alphaviruses, as they are phylogenetically distinct (Figure 3). Additional structural and mutagenesis studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanism of hydrolysis for macrodomain proteins.",

It is an emerging pathogen and possibly the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the world, with up to 3 million infections per year. HEV infection can lead to chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and can cause stillbirths of the fetus in pregnant women [29]. The ORF1 polyprotein of HEV contains multiple domains, including the macrodomain, which is adjacent to RNA helicase domain. Interestingly, the RNA helicase domain was shown to be important for the ability of the macrodomain to bind and hydrolyze PAR and MAR [8]. HEV replicates poorly in cell culture, so reverse genetic systems for this virus have largely utilized replicon systems where HEV replicon plasmids containing a reporter construct are transfected into Huh-7 cells. Parvez tested the role of the HEV macrodomain during infection using a replicon with a GFP reporter and found that mutations in loop 1 and loop 2 and in the highly conserved asparagine residue eliminated GFP expression, while Li et al., using a luciferase reporter, also found that similar mutations in these same regions reduced luciferase activity [8,30]. These studies indicate that the HEV macrodomain is likely important for virus replication, though it would be of interest to determine its impact using virus replication systems for HEV, which are limited at this time.",

A loop 1 mutant (G32E) even reverted following transfection into a mosquito cell line, indicating that antiviral ADP-ribosylation occurs in mosquito cells as well. To study the impact of the macrodomain in CHIKV infection, the authors made more subtle mutations in the macrodomain that allowed for the recovery of mutant viruses (G32S, G32A, T111A, and Y114A). While these mutants were only partially defective in hydrolase or ADP-ribose binding, they were severely attenuated in cell culture and in mice, demonstrating the incredible ability of ADP-ribosylation to restrict the replication of alphaviruses. Importantly, the Y114A mutation in SINV and CHIKV had reduced hydrolase activity but enhanced ADP-ribose-binding abilities. While attenuated compared to wild-type virus, this mutant was significantly more virulent than other mutations with similar hydrolase activity, indicating distinct roles for ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis in pathogenesis.",

However, these processes were dramatically reduced following infection of the G32S mutant virus, which is also defective in binding. This indicates that ADP-ribose binding but not hydrolysis activity is critical for early stages of the viral lifecycle.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, 7 of the 16 mouse PARPs were highly expressed and dramatically upregulated following MHV infection. Their expression was mostly absent in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 cells, consistent with their strong upregulation by IFN. To identify the specific PARP(s) that inhibits virus replication, an siRNA screen was then performed. Knockdown of both PARP12 and PARP14 partially restored mutant virus replication while having no impact on wild-type virus. All other PARPs tested were unable to restore mutant virus replication. In addition, PARP14 promoted IFN production during CoV infection or poly(I:C) treatment, consistent with another study showing that PARP14 enhanced IFN production following treatment of macrophages with lipopolysacharacide (LPS) stimulus [45]. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PARP12 and PARP14 are coronavirus restriction factors, but their functions are largely mitigated by the viral macrodomain.",

One of these types of stress is viral infection. Early stages of many virus infections result in the formation of dsRNA that can activate protein kinase R (PKR). PKR then phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, blocking mRNA translation, which then promotes the assembly of SGs [46]. These stress granules limit the amount of translation factors available, which potently interferes with virus replication as all viruses require cellular protein machinery to translate their proteins [47]. SGs are regulated by multiple different types of posttranslational modifications, including ADP-ribosylation. As such, SGs contain several PAR glycohydrolase isoforms, along with ADP-ribosylated proteins such as the RNA decay factor protein, G3BP1. In addition, several PARPs has been identified within the stress granules (PARP-5a, PARP-12, PARP-13, PARP14, and PARP-15); however, SG proteomes rarely identify all 5 of these PARPs, and so PARP composition dynamics within SGs likely differ according to multiple factors including cell type and type of stress [48,49,50].",

The hypervariable domain (HVD) was previously known to interact with G3BP1 and G3BP2, and thus, it was proposed that this interaction results in sequestration of G3BP1/2 and SG disassembly [53,54,55]. However, a recent study reported that the HVD of CHIKV alone was unable to affect SG formation, though it did interact with SGs. They did show that the full-length nsP3 was able to prevent the accumulation of SGs, suggesting that another factor in nsP3 besides the HVD is involved in SG disassembly. Interestingly, overexpression of the CHIKV macrodomain alone inhibited SG formation induced by multiple cell stressors. This study further showed that hydrolase activity of the macrodomain was required for the ability to disrupt SGs. Additionally, hydrolase activity was required to prevent arsenite-induced SG formation during a CHIKV infection. Finally, the authors hypothesized that the macrodomain could remove ADP-ribose from G3BP1, a critical factor for SG formation that is known to be ADP-ribosylated. Upon overexpression of G3BP1 in 293F cells, ADP-ribosylation of G3BP1 could be observed; however, this modification was lost upon overexpression of nsP3, suggesting that the macrodomain can remove ADP-ribose from G3BP1 [56]. Interestingly, there was a clear distinction in the composition of SGs that were disrupted by the macrodomain. The disrupted SGs still maintained mRNA-binding proteins but lost all proteins involved in translation, indicating that the macrodomain disrupts SGs in a specific manner. In conclusion, the results from this study show that SG formation is dependent on the ADP-ribosylation of proteins within SGs and that the hydrolase activity by the alphaviruses macrodomain is able to disassemble SGs.",

PARP12 and PARP14 were identified as PARPs that could restrict replication of macrodomain mutant MHV in BMDMs, but it is likely that other PARPs may be important for different viruses or in different cell types. Identification of these PARPs may aid in the identification of meaningful ADP-ribosylated targets. Knowing what PARPs are mediating antiviral ADP-ribosylation may also lead to novel antiviral strategies.",

Despite a large number of macrodomain structures, the biochemistry of the macrodomain still requires further investigation to determine the mechanism of hydrolysis.

Many in vitro assays for hydrolase activity utilize the de-ADP-ribosylation of auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP proteins, indicating that the macrodomain may be able to de-ADP-ribosylate most proteins it can interact with [8,9,25,27,32].",

Considering the significant attenuation seen with macrodomain mutants, it seems that the answer is yes. However, humans also have macrodomains, so there is the potential for significant side effects. It will be important to identify biochemical differences between human and viral macrodomains, such that antiviral therapeutics could be developed that are highly specific for viral macrodomains. Alternatively, these therapeutics could be useful in an agricultural setting for highly virulent infections such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pigs. As exemplified by the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, developing therapeutics targeting highly conserved viral proteins, such as the macrodomain, could be a useful for creating an arsenal of drugs that could be deployed to treat emerging alphavirus, hepatitis E, or coronavirus infections.",
