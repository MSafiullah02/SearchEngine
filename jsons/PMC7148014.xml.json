Since its inception in 2007, PAN has hosted 22 shared tasks at 21 different events with continually increasing reception within the community. The latest installment of PAN at CLEF 2019 had a strong focus on authorship analysis, featuring tasks on author profiling, celebrity profiling, authorship attribution, and style change detection. Continuing in 2020, PAN will again organize four shared tasks in these domains. The first task, profiling fake news spreaders on Twitter, addresses the critical societal problem of fake news from the perspective of author profiling, by studying stylistic deviations of users inclined to spread them. The second task, cross-domain authorship verification, studies the stylistic association between authors and their works in a setting without the interference of domain-specific vocabulary. The third task, celebrity profiling, analyzes the presumed influence that celebrities have on their followers to study whether celebrities can be profiled based on their followership. The fourth task, style change detection, continues the research on multi-author documents by attempting to separate segments of a document based on authorship.",

This helps in identifying profiling aspects such as age, gender, and language variety, among others. In the years 2013\u20132018, we addressed several aspects in the shared tasks we organized at PAN.1 In 2013, the aim was to identify gender and age in social media texts for English and Spanish [22]. The corpus included chat lines of potential pedophiles with the purpose of investigating the robustness of the best-performing systems also from this perspective (i.e., identifying the age of the pedophiles). Age classes included a gap in between: 10s (13\u201317), 20s (23\u201327), 30s (33\u201348). Results in both languages and in both subtasks were below 70% accuracy.",

The best results were obtained on Twitter, where users showed a more spontaneous way to communicate [20]. In 2015, apart from age and gender identification, we addressed also personality recognition in Twitter in English, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. The best results (above 80% accuracy) were obtained on English data [24]. In 2016, we addressed the problem of cross-genre gender and age identification (training on Twitter data and testing on blogs and social media data), in English, Spanish, and Dutch. The best results were obtained on blogs for English with an accuracy above 75% for gender and below 60% for age identification [25]. In 2017, we addressed gender and language variety identification in Twitter, in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. The lowest results were obtained for Arabic with an accuracy of 80% for gender and 83% for language variety identification [23]. In 2018, our aim was to investigate if approaching gender identification in Twitter from a multimodal perspective (e.g., considering also images of the links in tweets) could improve results. The corpus was composed of English, Spanish, and Arabic tweets. Only for Arabic it was possible to improve accuracy (albeit less than 2%) [21].",

We used Twitter data both in English and Spanish and the best-performing systems showed that it is possible to profile bots with an accuracy above 90%. Advanced bots that generated human-like language, also with metaphors, were the most difficult to be profiled. It is interesting to mention that when bots were profiled as humans, they were mostly confused with males [19].

Recently fake news detection has gained a lot of attention from the research community. Indeed, their early detection can prevent further dissemination of false claims and rumors, but it\u2019s a hard and time-consuming task, since they involve manual annotation. Recent approaches that have been proposed [6, 7, 16] are effective in detecting false claims that already have been disseminated, but not the newly emerging ones. In addition, these models do not take into account the role of users that unintentionally or intentionally share the false claims and who play a critical role in their propagation. To this end, in this task, we aim at identifying and profiling fake news spreaders on social media as a first step towards preventing fake news from being propagated among online users.",

Celebrities can contribute much to author profiling research: they are prolific social media users, often supplying extensive writing samples as well as personal details. Celebrities build a consistent public persona either themselves or with the help of public relations agents. In addition, celebrities are in a unique position within their communities: they are highly influential on their followers, frequently considered trustworthy and reliable, and they act as hubs for like-minded people on social media. Celebrity Profiling [30] is the newest addition to PAN\u2019s shared tasks. In 2019 [31], the goal was to determine the demographics age, gender, occupation, and fame from the timelines of celebrities on Twitter. Eight participants submitted solutions, which, given sufficient training data, performed well on demographics with a coherent separability by topic or domain. Poor performance was achieved in cases where certain demographics are rare (e.g., non-binary genders), or where they are underrepresented (e.g., age groups for very low and high ages). Also domain-invariant demographics, like the scientific creative occupations, posed problems. The results of the first shared task on celebrity profiling are coherent with most of the related work in author profiling, authorship analysis, and computational stylometry in general: the domain-specific vocabulary is the primary discriminator and demographic differences are often reflected by topics.",

For the upcoming edition of celebrity profiling, we focus on separating a celebrity author\u2019s textual characteristics from domain-specific language use, using the demographics as an indicator. Instead of predicting the authors demographics from his text alone, we use the texts of highly influenced individuals, while the prediction targets remain largely the same as last year (age, gender, occupation). The results of this shared task will help us to determine for the first time, whether and to what extent an influencer\u2019s demographics and characteristics can be predicted from his or her followers.

Author identification still poses a challenging empirical problem in fields related to information and computer science, but the underlying methods are nowadays also increasingly used as an auxiliary technology in more applied domains, such as literary studies or forensic linguistics. These communities crucially rely on trustworthy, transparent benchmark initiatives that reliably establish the state of the art in the field [17]. Author identification is concerned with the automated identification of the individual(s) who authored an anonymous document on the basis of text-internal properties related to language and writing style [9, 12, 27]. At different editions of PAN (since 2007), author identification has been studied in multiple incarnations: Authorship Attribution: given a document and a set of candidate authors, determine which of them wrote the document (2011\u20132012, 2016\u20132020); Authorship Verification: given a pair of documents, determine whether they are written by the same author (2013\u20132015); Authorship Obfuscation: given a document and a set of documents from the same author, paraphrase the former so that its author cannot be identified anymore (2016\u20132018); Obfuscation Evaluation: devise and implement performance measures that quantify safeness, soundness, and/or sensibleness of an obfuscation software (2016\u20132018).",

Fan writers actively aim to increase their readership and on most platforms (e.g., archiveofourown.org or fanfiction.net), the bulk of writings can be openly accessed, although the intellectual rights are not unproblematic [29]. The multilingualism of the phenomenon is another asset, extending far beyond the Indo-European languages that are the traditional focus of shared tasks.

Including multiple fandoms into training and/or test pairs is another valuable aspect for experimentation.

Likewise, one explicitly can vary the number of test authors (if any) that have not been encountered in training.

We aim to steer the task back to its original goal: detecting the exact position of authorship changes. Therefore, the task for PAN\u201920 is to find the positions of style changes at the paragraph-level. For each pair of consecutive paragraphs of a document, we ask participants to estimate whether there is indeed a style change between those two paragraphs. This binary classification task will be performed on a dataset curated based on a publicly available dump of a Q&A platform to cover different types of documents at different lengths and topics. We will distill two different datasets: one featuring a rather narrow set of topics being discussed, and a second dataset containing a broad variety of topics. This setup allows for analyzing the performance of the developed approaches in dimensions of text length, topics, and the number of contributing authors.",
