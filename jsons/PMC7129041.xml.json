Bedside lung ultrasound has been invaluable in the treatment of the critically ill (Lichtenstein 2014; Soldati et al. 2020) and, specifically, for diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients (Gorbalenya et al. 2020). Ultrasound is increasingly used within the point of care setting, as chest computed tomography is often not available in emergency departments (Poggiali et al. 2020). Ultrasound may also be used for longitudinal monitoring of affected patients (Peng et al. 2020). However, the ultrasound unit can be a potential vector in the transmission of an infection (Skowronek et al. 2016; Westerway and Basseal 2017), and previous surveys have indicated a gap in knowledge of basic infection prevention measures in ultrasound (Westerway et al. 2019). Because of the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and given the proximity necessary to perform an ultrasound examination, it is essential to take all safety precautions when undertaking routine clinical activity.",

The structure of these viruses includes a lipid envelope, which is easily disrupted by most disinfectants such as 62%\u201371% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min.

The virus is involved in human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic (Chan et al. 2020; Yuen et al. 2020), and there are increasing reports of asymptomatic carriers of the disease (Bai et al. 2020; Holshue et al. 2020).

            "text": "Preventing transmission of infection requires all health care practitioners to implement both standard and transmission-based precautions, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Standard precautions for COVID-19 as outlined by the CDC in 2020 include:1.Ultrasound practitioners with specific health problems that place them at greater risk (as detailed by local occupational health guidelines) are to be excluded from performing ultrasound.2.Ensure the ultrasound practitioners have undergone infection control training and fit testing for respirators, if required (for example N95 and FFP3).3.To reduce the risk of transmission, it is important to (i) respect the time of scheduled visits, (ii) widen the appointment intervals to prevent crowding in the waiting room and (iii) space the seats in the waiting room to at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart.4.Limit the number of visitors in the examination room to a maximum of 1, preferably with no children. During the pandemic, it is reasonable not to allow trainees or students to participate. Encourage use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets.5.If the status of a patient is confirmed as COVID-19 infected, it would be preferable to scan the patient at the end of the clinic list so that the equipment and room will undergo vigorous cleaning and disinfection (see below, Preparing and cleaning the ultrasound room)).6.Hand hygiene: All ultrasound practitioners should perform hand hygiene before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material (e.g., linen from patient room) and before and after removing personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves. Hand hygiene should be performed using an alcohol-based hand rub (60%\u201395% alcohol) or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water before the alcohol-based hand rub. Latex-free disposable gloves should be used during the ultrasound examination and changed after each patient.7.Scanning should, as much as possible, be performed with one (clean) hand and transducer while having the other hand semi-clean but in contact with the keyboard. Gel application should occur with the semi-clean hand dispensing clean gel (see below), with post-procedure thorough cleaning of the gel bottle using an LLD. See details on gel use below (Specific recommendations regarding ultrasound gel).8.If required to scan the patient in an isolation room, ultrasound practitioners, as all attending medical staff, should don PPE (respirator, goggles, face protective shield, surgical gown and gloves) before entry of isolation room, where the level of PPE is set by institutional guidelines.9.PPE: Any reusable PPE (e.g., gowns) must be properly cleaned and decontaminated. Specific PPE recommendations when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection include:a.Respirator or face mask: As ultrasound practitioners are in close contact with patients, surgical face masks are essential to offer protection. These must be put on before entry into the patient room or care area. N95 respirators or respirators that offer a higher level of protection should be used instead of a face mask when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedure, particularly for use in the intensive care unit. It is important to perform hand hygiene after removal of the respirator or face mask.b.Eye protection (for ultrasound practitioners in the critical care setting): This includes goggles or a disposable face shield that must be put on when entering the patient room or care area. Reusable eye protection (e.g., goggles) must be cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturer's reprocessing instructions before re-use. Disposable eye protection should be discarded after use. An individual risk assessment should be carried out before or at the time of providing care to the patient.c.Gloves: Wearing clean, non-sterile gloves upon entry into the patient room or care area is essential for all ultrasound practitioners. Once the ultrasound examination is complete, remove and discard gloves when leaving the patient room or care area and immediately perform hand hygiene.d.Gowns: Wearing a clean isolation gown upon entry into the patient room or care area is essential. Reusable gowns should be discarded in a dedicated container for linen and laundered. Disposable gowns should be discarded after use. If there are shortages of gowns, they need to be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing.e.Donning and doffing training: Workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment must be trained on how to put it on, use and wear it and how to take it off correctly, including in the context of their current and potential duties. Training material should be easy to understand and available in the appropriate language and literacy level for all workers. Information may be found on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration websites.\n\n",

In emergency medicine, primary care and critical care, handheld ultrasound instruments are often used for COVID-19 infected (and other) patients because of ease of transport and seemingly easier cleaning methods, secondary to a simpler user interface. If possible, keep the whole device and phone in a sterile transducer cover sleeve, which is available commercially. An example of how to place the transducer and ultrasound instrument in a sheath can be found on the Butterfly website (See below table of various ultrasound manufacturers). The hardware should be cleaned with an LLD, and transducers should be cleaned and disinfected as detailed below.\u2022If available, equipment covers, such as for the ultrasound scanner console, will enhance the workflow, as LLD of mechanical keyboards and console controls is time-consuming. It is important to note that if the cover is contaminated, it must be cleaned, and the presence of a cover does not preclude the need for cleaning the equipment at regular intervals.\u2022Reduce the number of transducers connected to the ultrasound machine to a minimum. All other transducers should be individually stored safely in a clean, closed cabinet and brought out as needed.\u2022Ultrasound transducers and cables should be cleaned (see Transducer cleaning and disinfection), and this should also be performed after each scan.\n",
