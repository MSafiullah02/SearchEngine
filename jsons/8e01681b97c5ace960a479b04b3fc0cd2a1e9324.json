In the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, Section 5001(c) required the Secretary to identify, by October 1, 2007, at least two conditions that are (a) high cost or high volume or both, (b) result in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis, and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, hospitals will not receive additional payment for cases in which one of the selected Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC) was not present on admission and the case would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present.

Vector-borne transmission may be mechanical or biological. Mechanical transmission is the physical transmission of an infectious agent, which is not an essential element in its life cycle. Flies can transmit Salmonella on their appendages from contaminated feces to food, representing mechanical transmission. Biological transmission occurs when a vector harbors a pathogen within its body and delivers the pathogen to a host in an interactive manner, such as through propagation, a bite.

Susceptibility depends on age, genetic factors, general health and immunity. Decreasing age, especially before 11 years of age when the immune system reaches maturity, and increasing age, especially over 65 years, each are associated with increased susceptibility. General health is influenced by nutrition and the presence of comorbidities, with better health associated with a lower likelihood of developing infectious disease. HIV is a major risk factor for the progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. Immunity is a biological defense primarily provided by two categories of circulating white blood cells: lymphocytes which produce antibodies (a humoral immunity secreting antibodies) or a through a cell-mediated immunity (detecting and destroying antigens or destruction of foreign cells), and monoctyes (a phagocytic response) which have a specific action on the microorganism or on its toxin. Immunity can be characterized as passive (natural or artificial) or active (natural or artificial). Passive natural immunity is the transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to fetus. Passive artificial immunity is the inoculation of specific protective antibodies in globulin preparations. Passive artificial immunity has a short-term efficacy (less than 6 months). Active immunity is provided through a humoral mechanism can be natural, as in the case of acquiring an infection (with or without clinical manifestations of disease), or artificial in which the agent itself in a killed or modified form (via a vaccine) is injected to stimulate protective antibodies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Susceptibility"}, {"text": "The occurrence of a disease in excess of what is expected is called an epidemic. The existence of an epidemic is determined in different manners depending upon epidemiologic data on the frequency of its natural occurrence and seasonal variation. Influenza epidemics are defined as rates occurring in excess of one standard deviation above historical trends. Epidemics occurring where the frequency of a disease is expected to be low are determined through a graphical method or the construction of an epidemic curve. A point source epidemic curve follows a bell-shaped distribution of a histogram plotting the number of cases occurring on each date when a case became ill. The peak of the histogram represents the date where the median number of cases became ill. Knowing the suspect infection agent and tracing the incubation time from the date associated with the peak of the histogram an estimate of the time of exposure to the agent can be obtained. A propagated epidemic curve is illustrated by a histogram of the onset of the disease demonstrating repeated peaks of occurrence ( Fig. 2a) . Epidemics can also be cyclic, recurring according to certain time periods. Influenza and pneumonia-associated deaths typically occur as a cyclic epidemic, with the epidemic threshold exceeded during winter months (Fig. 2b ). Epidemics can occur in any setting, in the community or in any setting where populations are in congregate settings (hospitals, prisons, skilled care facilities, schools, etc.). A pandemic is an epidemic that is an epidemic manifest world-wide. The severity of pandemic disease can vary over the phases of its course. Miller et al. (2009) describe the signature features of past pandemics, including a shift in the virus sub-type, a shift toward increased mortality in younger age groups, multiple successive lethal waves, and high susceptibility of populations resulting in increased transmissibility. Depending upon the features of the pandemic including its potential for animalhuman transmission and the extent of countries and regions involved, the World Health Organization (2009) proposed a scheme of phases guiding the deployment of different levels of resources, interventions, and communications for disease control.

According to the World Health Organization (2007), \"A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g., bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.\" The actual number of cases constituting an epidemic depends upon the infectious agent and the circumstances of the case presentation.

Health care settings are susceptible to epidemics and outbreaks.

Second, health care settings often have a high prevalence of patients who are immunocompromised and therefore Standard Precautions should be used in the care of all patients (Table 9) . Although for most communicable diseases, Standard Precautions are recommended, there are also Airborne, Contact, and Droplet Precautions which may be indicated for selected infections and conditions (Siegel et al., 2007) .

Hazard communication involves not only written policies and procedures, but also communication in terms of signage and training. Warning labels affixed to biohazardous waste containers, refrigerators, and biohazardous waste bags identified by red color as signage on patients'doors are examples of hazard communication. Training given to employees on their risk level to bloodborne disease and other occupational exposures at orientation and annual retraining is another form of communication. Communication in the event of outbreaks is essential not only to employees, but also to patients and the community. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2005) identified a list of best practices in communicating with the public during outbreaks which apply in any culture, political system, or developmental state of a nation. According to the WHO, the communications of the existence of an outbreak should include the following elements: trust-building; announcing early; transparency (candid, easily understood, complete, accurate); an understanding of the public's beliefs, opinions and knowledge about risks; and, a preparedness plan. It is felt that greater cooperation by the public in participating with control measures will result with effective communication. There is growing interest by public groups for information regarding the morbidity and mortality rates of infectious diseases in health care facilities.Standard precautions component Recommendations Patient placement Prioritize for single-patient room if patient is at increased risk of transmission, is likely to contaminate the environment, does not maintain appropriate hygiene, or is at increased risk of acquiring infection or developing adverse outcome following infection Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (source containment of infectious respiratory secretions in symptomatic patients, beginning at initial point of encounter e.g., triage and reception areas in emergency departments and physician offices)Instruct symptomatic persons to cover mouth/nose when sneezing/coughing; use tissues and dispose in no-touch receptacle; observe hand hygiene after soiling of hands with respiratory secretions; wear surgical mask if tolerated or maintain spatial separation, >3 feet possible", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Health care managers must assure that PPE is available to employees as appropriate, in addition to administrative controls.
