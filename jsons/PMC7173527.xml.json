            "text": "Transposable elements in eucaryotes can nearly all be classified into three basic types.\nThe first type, typified by the Ac elements of plants and the P elements of Drosophila, resemble bacterial transposons in that they bear short inverted repeat termini; the available evidence strongly suggests that this type of element transposes directly via a DNA intermediate. However, most eucaryotic transposons differ from the bacterial elements in that they encode a reverse transcriptase (RT) or RT-like protein. Two basic types of these \u2018retrotransposons\u2019 are known \u2013\nthe LTR (long terminal repeat)-containing type, which are structurally highly reminiscent of retroviruses, and the\npoly (A)-type, which lack LTRs and usually (but not always) contain an oligo (A), poly (A) or similar sequence tract at their extreme 3\u2032 end. These two types of retrotransposon are shown in Fig. 1. Both classes of retrotransposons are now known from organisms as phylogenetically distinct as fungi, trypanosomes, insects and mammals. Hence this brief review will focus on what is currently known about fungal retrotransposons, principally the retrotransposons that are more retroviral-like and are distinguished by the presence of LTRs. Thus, only a small and highly selective glimpse of the total picture of retrotransposons is provided.\n",

They contain LTR sequences of a few hundred base pairs long flanking a central coding region that contains one or two open reading frames (ORFs), called gag and pol by analogy to the retroviral counterparts. As is the case with proviruses and DNA-based transposons, target site duplications of a fixed length flank the elements. These vary greatly in sequence and are presumably generated during the integration process by a transposon-encoded integrase function. In the cases where the RNA has been examined, it resembles retroviral genomic RNA in that it extends from LTR to LTR and is terminally repetitious, allowing definition of U3, R and U5 regions of the LTR sequence in a manner formally analogous to that used by retrovirologists. The elements with two ORFs clearly contain the equivalents of gag and pol, but no analogue of retroviral env. The elements with single ORFs, Tf1 and Tf2, (and possibly also Ty5) apparently translate a Gag/Pol fusion protein only. In all cases, the primary translation products are then cleaved into smaller final products by the element encoded aspartyl protease.\n",

Gag is produced directly by conventional translation of this mRNA, whereas Pol is expressed as a Gag-Pol fusion protein (readthrough protein); this \u2018frameshifting\u2019 process is mediated at a special sequence within the region of overlap of gag and pol. Both the Ty1 and Ty3 frameshifts differ from those of more conventional retroviruses in that they are +1 frameshifts rather than \u22121 frameshifts, and the intrinsic mechanism used to effect the frameshift is different. In the \u22121 frameshifts used by retroviruses, coronaviruses, and the yeast killer double-stranded RNA virus, a \u2018slippery site\u2019 allows for a simultaneous slip of the ribosome during the translational step in which the ribosomal P and A sites are simultaneously occupied. Stem\u2013loop structures or pseudoknots that are often found just downstream of the slippery site are thought to cause ribosomal pausing and perhaps even to induce the ribosome to slip backwards. In contrast, the Ty1 element appears to utilize a completely different mechanism. There appears to be no requirement for any special RNA secondary structure; rather the frameshifting appears to be sequence-mediated, because a seven nucleotide sequence from the overlap region readily confers frameshifting on a heterologous reporter gene. Ribosomal pausing, thought to be required for frameshifting, is apparently caused by limiting amounts of a rare tRNA, tRNAArg\nCCU. The stalled ribosome, which unlike the retroviral case, has an empty A site, has the P site occupied by a specific tRNALeu that recognizes all six Leu codons. The stall caused by low tRNAArg levels allows time for the slippage event to occur; the tRNALeu slips to an overlapping Leu codon in the +1 (pol) frame. This then exposes a Gly codon recognized by an apparently abundant tRNA in the A site, allowing translation to continue in the pol frame. This mechanism results in an efficiency of frameshifting that varies somewhat with context, but on average is about 10\u201320%.",

What follows is a working model for this assembly process, although this is based largely on interpretations of the limited experiments that have been done on Ty assembly and by analogy with retroviral systems and models. Ty RNA is apparently selectively packaged, together with at least one specific tRNA, the primer tRNA, into a capsid initially consisting of a coassemblage of unprocessed Gag and Gag-Pol proteins. Presumably, these coassemble via Gag-Gag interactions, and these are made in such a way that the C-termini of the proteins, and the RNA, reside in the internal cavity of the virus-like particle (VLP). The aspartyl protease encoded within pol, presumably activated by a dimerization process facilitated by the high protein concentration involved in the assembly process, then cleaves the precursor Gag proteins and Gag-Pol proteins to their mature, presumably physiologically relevant forms. This results in a change in the morphology of the VLPs, as well as an apparent activation of the endogenous reverse transcriptase activity.",

Like retroviral core particles, which have this same activity, these VLPs require only a divalent cation for activity. The Ty DNA is apparently synthesized inside VLPs inside the cytoplasm. It is interesting to consider how and in what form this DNA is delivered to the nucleus. This is a particularly interesting question to ask in yeast, because fungi, unlike mammalian cells, undergo a \u2018closed mitosis\u2019 in which the nuclear membrane does not break down and reform during each mitosis, but apparently remains intact. Recent experiments implicate a small basic amino acid sequence at the C-terminus of the integrase in this process.

            "text": "\nThe presence of VLPS in Ty elements has often raised the question of the evolutionary relationship between retroviruses and LTR-containing retrotransposons. Is the VLP a degenerate leftover of some decaying retrovirus? Or are LTR-containing retrotransposons a family of modern-day descendants of the precursor of the retroviruses? Presumably all retroelements descended ultimately from a \u2018cellular reverse transcriptase gene\u2019 as originally proposed by Temin. This gene may be ancient, and its original product may have been the molecule that archived the genetic information of the RNA world into DNA. Examination of the spectrum of modern-day retroelements from this perspective, reveals a natural progression from the simple to the very complex, as follows: starting with a simple RT gene (perhaps represented by modern-day telomerase?), to the poly (A)-type retrotransposons, which contain a second ORF in addition to RT, to the LTR-containing retrotransposons, which have the above plus LTRs, to the simple retroviruses, which have acquired a third ORF, env, and on to the most elaborate of all, the lentiviruses, with multiple additional regulatory reading frames in addition to the basic three. Since all LTR-containing retrotransposons studied appear to involve a VLP intermediate (that is, all examined to date have many properties of a transposition intermediate), the implication is that, as is the case in all complex biological reactions, a structure is built to ensure (1) high local concentration of numerous macromolecules required for the reaction and (2) appropriate orientations/conformations of these macromolecules to allow the reactions to proceed appropriately. The strongest support for this idea comes from studies on Ty1, which suggest that the VLP is a direct, functional transposition intermediate. Thus, if LTR-containing retrotransposons predated retroviruses, and their VLP structure evolved in response to selection for this organizing function, it does not stretch the imagination too far to suggest that these elements were \u2018preadapted\u2019 for subsequent selection for infectivity. In fact, one may see such transitional forms within the gypsy family of LTR-containing retrotransposons, in which some family members resemble the Tys in having two ORFs, but a few elements have a third env-like ORF in the appropriate genomic position.",

A large number of host genes that play roles in Ty and host gene transcription have been uncovered genetically; these are called SPT genes because they were originally identified by mutations that suppressed the effect of Ty or LTR insertions. Although some of these affect Ty transcription, they do not affect the production of GAL/Ty mRNA. The development of sensitive assays for transposition of GAL/Tys in vivo has led to the identification of a number of host factors that are important for transposition at a post-transcriptional level; these are reviewed in Table 2.\n",
