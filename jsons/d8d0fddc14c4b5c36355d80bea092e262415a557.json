We have combined SEIRD model with a time-dependent infection rate function, to fit the real data of i) infection counts and ii) death rates due to COVID-19, for the period between March 2 nd and Mai 15 th 2020. By fitting the infection rate, SEIRD model placed the infection peak on 04/24/2020 and could reproduce it to a large extent on the expense of recovery and death rates. Fitting the SEIRD model to death rates gives rather satisfactory predictions with a maximum of infections on 04/06/2020. Regardless of the low peak position, the confirmed cases and transmission rate were well reproduced. : medRxiv preprint 20 In this paper, we report the result of modeling the outbreak of COVID-19 in Morocco using SEIRD model, we discuss the validity and limits of the model and we give an estimate of the magnitude of the epidemic wave, i.e. number of infected individuals, transmission rate and an estimated end of the epidemic wave. 25 2. Methods and Theory Although its novelty, the corona virus COVID-19 seems to follow the same spread dynamic like other pathogens. Since the outstanding work by W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick [1] who laid the foundation of the SIR model (susceptible-infected-recovered), several mathematical models have been devel-30 oped to describe the spread of several infectious diseases [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Nowadays, these models are not new and have many open-source Python and Matlab code implementations available online. In this work, we have used a known mathematical model, which consists of five compartments (S \u2212 E \u2212 I \u2212 R \u2212 D): Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected",

To slow-down the transmission of COVID-19 among the population and to avoid a high fatality rate, each country was forced to adopt drastic containment and preventive measures going from social distancing to a complete lock-down of the entire country. 10 Earlier in March 2020, Morocco found itself fighting against COVID-19, which seems to be one of the worst waves of transmissible diseases that hits the country in the past 200 years. Morocco took strict preventive measures to limit the spread of the virus, including the closure of borders, the nationwide 15 lock-down, as well as the compulsory wearing of face-masks. Thanks to these measures, the COVID-19 spread seems to be controlled so far. However, a clear picture regarding the magnitude and the dynamics of the epidemic wave is still not yet drawn.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have analyzed the data of COVID-19 epidemic wave that 140 hits the Moroccan territory starting from March 2 nd . Thanks to the aggressiveness of containment measures, the country has recorded one of the low death rates across the Globe. The analysis of COVID-19 data using a standard model composed of five compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead (SEIRD) during the period 03/02/2020 \u2212 05/15/2020 suggest that the 145 11 .

Indeed, the death rate depends on several factors, like the health system, the average age of the elderly people, their health conditions, availability of intensive care units, etc. But in the absence of statistics regarding the factors influencing death rates, it is still 160 premature to draw conclusions. Besides that, the fit gives rather satisfactory reproduction of the death data. Further, it reaches a plateau of about 220 death cases, which seems reasonable, with the data reported so far. The drawback of such approach is the down-shift of the position of the epidemic peak and the large number of infections reported on that day. Although, this is rather harsh 165 but it still not very surprising if taking into account the low testing rate. Moreover, the predicted R 0 and the total number of infections C(t) further support the robustness of this approach when fitting the model to data.",

The down-shift of the epidemic peak as well as the predicted large number of infected cases can be understood if we take into account the initial low testing performed by Morocco,125 especially at the early stage of the epidemic period. Theoretically, by increasing the testing rate, we can expect a down-shift of the inflection point and an increase of infected cases, as this population would be detected earlier. One more important evidence about the robustness of this model is the total number of confirmed cases C(t) which saturates at 7000. Figure 4 shows the evolution 130 of the predicted confirmed cases C(t) together with real COVID-19 data. Even if the predicted curve is down shifted (as consequence of the inflection point in the predicted infection curve), both curves seems to follow the same trend, with a constant difference (due always to the same reasons discussed above). The predicted saturation value saturates at the end of the epidemic wave ( 7000), 135 seems to be realistic with the trend of COVID-19 dynamics in Morocco, unless other external factors enter into account such as hotbeds of contagion.",

However, it underestimates the recovery and death rates, leading thus to a low prediction 150 of the total number of the confirmed cases. The R 0 = 2.05 at the beginning of the epidemic period is lower than that expected for COVID-19 worldwide. Even if the model seems to be reliable in predicting the infection rates, it does so at the expense of other compartment of the population.
