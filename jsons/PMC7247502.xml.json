From the first self-isolation measures to total lock-downs and quarantines for preventing its spreading, the way humans interact has changed, and probably, for good. Joined efforts from the scientific community have helped to design strategies for supporting public-health policies, and for providing a better understanding of the current scenario. In particular, several mathematical models have been proposed in recent weeks to fit public databases on the SARS-CoV2 outbreak and forecast its evolution. Despite their particularities, most of them evolve from the well-known SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick [12]. The basic idea behind this model, and its variants, is to divide a population in different compartments, representing the S (susceptible), E (exposed), I (infected), A (asymptomatic), R (recovered), D (dead), Q (quarantined), among other fractions of it. Centering our analysis on the spread of COVID-19, and restricting our search to those models recently proposed, we may find different combinations of the variables mentioned above.",

Even though the model involved several variables, the parameter-fitting stage only considered an exponential approximation, leaving unclear how the infection and recovery rates were decoupled. Another variant of SEIR models was presented by Yang and Wang [22], including an equation for the concentration of SARS-CoV2 in the environmental reservoir. [19] present a sophisticated 7-compartment variant of SEIR models, where the extra variables account for the quarantined Q, dead D, and insusceptible P fractions of the population. Moreover, their model includes the temporal evolution of the rates of recovery and infection-driven death. Kucharski et al. [13] used a stochastic dynamic model to fit publicly available datasets of Wuhan to give better insights on the early dynamics of COVID-19, and therefore predict if newly introduced cases would generate outbreaks in other areas. Pang [18] present several public health recommendations, based on the modeling of the effect of different regulations for preventing the spread of COVID-19 on a SEIRA model similar to the one presented by Aguilar et al. [1], highlighting the challenges that an epidemic of an aerial contagious virus with asymptomatic patients pose.",

Due to the generality of our model, we can easily modify it to account for different particularities of any population. In our model, we represent the interactions between the different groups by a non-necessarily symmetrical matrix connecting the different sub-groups, accounting for the fraction that effectively interacts. Particularities of novel COVID-19 were used to model the infection dynamics, so individuals could be infected by foreigners in their region, or while they are visiting a different one. We apply our model in a case of study for representing the dynamics between different behavioral groups, highlighting its applicability to the early prediction of contingencies.",

Other suppositions, as listed below, are based on the state-of-the-art knowledge of COVID-19 and other population-balance considerations.\u2022There exists an incubation period for the virus, which average has been reported to range between 5.2 days [14], [15] and 6.4 days [2]. This fact justifies the existence of a compartment E (exposed).\u2022The asymptomatic fraction of a given population, which varies from 29% [16], going through 50% [17] and rising between 50 and 75% [7], will be considered constant \u03b1. This hypothesis makes sense if the size of the population and its immunological characteristics are homogeneous.\u2022The only possible interaction among different classes is infection. Recoveries and deaths are supposed to occur in the group where they belong.\u2022Asymptomatic patients are \u03be times more likely to transmit the infection successfully to a healthy patient. Even though the viral load of asymptomatic individuals is in the same order of magnitude than in symptomatic patients [24], our supposition relies on a social-interaction basis. Symptomatic patients are easily avoided, quarantined, or likely to choose self-isolation, which is not the case of asymptomatic individuals.\n",

Fractions of C are likely to provide services in zones A and B, and therefore interact with their population. Zone B acts as the center of the city, where people meet for office work. Supposing e is the characteristic fraction of the population working in different zones, the interaction matrix \u03a61 in normal circumstances (Case 1) is given by equation 12. Once the outbreak took place in A, its dynamics were controlled by parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8), which were also valid for its propagation to B. As life quality and access to public-health is worse in C, we will suppose such parameters to be, respectively, half and double from the values reported for them in A. The contagious rate in C would also be higher (for example, a 10% higher), as the lack of work-safety policies would press people to work even if they already started to feel sick. Then, the dynamics in C would be characterized by (2\u03b2,\u03b32,1.1\u03b8).
