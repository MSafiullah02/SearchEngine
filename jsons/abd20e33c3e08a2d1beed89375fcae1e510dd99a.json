The overall objective of this study was to explore FIV-induced alterations in cell counts and cytokine gene expression in the pulmonary compartment during the acute stage infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were collected from FIV-infected and control cats at 0, 4, 10, and 16 weeks post-FIV infection for phenotype and cytokine analysis. The major change in BAL cellular populations following FIV-infection was the development of a neutrophilia. Total BAL cell counts and relative numbers of alveolar macrophages (AM), eosinophils, and lymphocytes remained similar in both groups. The RT-qcPCR analyses of AM puri\u00aeed from BAL showed constitutive expression of TNFa, IL6 and IL10 mRNAs that peaked during the acute stage of infection then declined. The TNFa and IL6 bioactive protein secretion showed a similar response. In contrast, IFNg expression increased progressively with time after infection and paralleled a progressive increase in FIV-gag mRNA in AM. The IL12 p40 expression also differed from the other cytokines in that there was a progressive decrease in the number of cats with AM IL12 expression following FIV infection. Infection of AM in vitro with FIV also caused an increase in Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 79 (2001) 83\u00b1100 : S 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 ( 0 1 ) 0 0 2 5 0 -1 TNFa and IL6 mRNA and bioactive protein suggesting that the increased cytokine response by AM following infection of cats with FIV is an intrinsic characteristic of FIV-infected AM. In summary, pulmonary immune changes seen in FIV-infected cats are similar to those seen in HIV-infected human patients. #",

The primary line of defense against such pathogens is the activated alveolar macrophage (Beck and Shellito, 1989) . Activation of alveolar macrophages (AM) is a biphasic process regulated by a number of cytokines generated by antigen speci\u00aec T cells (IFNg, TNFa) and the AM itself (TNFa, IL6, IL12). Early activation occurs as a result of IFNg and TNFa production from NK cells and macrophages. A more sustained activation of AM, which is required for successful control of intracellular pathogens, is dependent upon development of a Th1 immune response (IFNg and IL12).",

As both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are produced by activated macrophages, it may be the ratio of the particular cytokines that is important in determining whether macrophages will function properly or not. For example, although low levels of IL12 are constitutively produced by the AM of HIV-infected patients, levels could not be increased following stimulation by Staphylococcus aureus (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994) . These data suggest that although AM from HIV-infected patients constitutively secrete cytokines associated with activation, when faced with a secondary infectious agent, the AM cannot reach the level of activation necessary for successful clearance of the organism, possibly due to a failure in mounting a protective Th1 immune response.",

The acute infection is followed by a variably long asymptomatic period characterized by a progressive decrease of CD4 lymphocytes that results in the hallmark inverted CD4 :CD8 ratio in the peripheral blood (Bendinelli et al., 1995; English et al., 1994) . The asymptomatic period is followed by the development of AIDS-associated disorders, many of which mimic AIDS in humans (Bendinelli et al., 1995; English et al., 1994) . Davidson et al. (1993) and Yang et al. (1996) reported that FIV-infected cats challenged with an avirulent strain of T. gondii developed severe respiratory disease resulting in 60\u00b180% mortality/euthanasia. The FIV-infected cats developed systemic toxoplasmosis characterized by necrotic/ in\u00afammatory foci in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and most severely in the lung. The lesions were accompanied by abundant replication of Toxoplasma tachyzoites readily noticeable in the sites of in\u00afammation. In contrast, FIV\u00c0 cats developed only a transient, mild clinical disease characterized by anorexia and lethargy without clinical signs of pulmonary involvement. Levy et al. (1998) examined the peripheral and bronchial lymph nodes from normal and FIV-infected cats following challenge with T. gondii and reported a marked difference in the cytokine pro\u00aele in the two groups of cats. As compared to control cats challenged with T. gondii, cells harvested from the lymph nodes of FIV-T. gondii co-infected cats produced high levels of IL10 and IFNg but were de\u00aecient in IL2 and IL12 (p40) mRNA production. Dean and Pedersen (1998) also reported elevated levels of IL10 and IFNg mRNA in lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats.",

Brie\u00afy, cats were anesthetized with ketamine and intubated so that the end of an endotracheal tube was positioned within the distal trachea. Lavage was performed in three aliquots through the tube with the cat in left lateral recumbency using a volume of 5 ml/kg body weight of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in each aliquot. The aliquots were pooled, total viable BAL cell counts determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, and differential cell analyses performed on Diff\u00b1Quik stained cytospins. Using the differential to determine the numbers of AM per milliliter of BAL\u00afuid, duplicate cultures of AM (along with other contaminating BAL cells) were seeded in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics containing 1 \u00c2 10 6 AM/ml each. Following overnight incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with HBSS.

Therefore, we investigated the ability of AM from FIV-infected cats to produce IFNg. In contrast to AM from control cats, AM from FIV-infected cats produced high levels of IFNg mRNA. Unlike the other cytokines, IFNg mRNA levels increased progressively over the course of the infection (Fig. 4D , P 0:003 at 10 weeks; P 0:002 at 16 weeks). Table 1 shows that the numbers of FIV-infected cats expressing IFNg mRNA also increased with time, whereas IFNg mRNA was detected in only one control cat at one time point (16 weeks post-FIV infection). Thus, FIV-induced changes in IFNg mRNA expression by AM was manifested by a time-related increase in the number of cats expressing IFNg mRNA, as well as an increase in the level of expression for individual cats. Table 2 shows that the AM collected from control cats consistently maintained low but measurable constitutive IL12 p40 mRNA expression at all timepoints. In contrast, the AM Table 1 ). from the FIV cats demonstrated a progressive decrease in IL12 mRNA expression with time after infection, such that there was a progressive decrease in the number of cats with detectable IL12 mRNA. When compared as groups, the AM from FIV-infected cats expressed signi\u00aecantly less (P 0:032) IL12 mRNA that control cats at week 16 (data not shown). However, the FIV-infected cats that maintained IL12 mRNA expression (3/ 12) had levels similar to that seen in the control cats (data not shown).",

Similarly, increases in distinct cell populations including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages have also been reported in HIV-infected patients, in some cases, without altering the total cell counts (Agostini et al., 1988; Davis et al., 1993) . Because the pulmonary neutrophilia was not accompanied by either a systemic neutrophilia, clinical symptoms of illness, or bacterial contamination of the BAL\u00afuid, the neutrophilia is related to FIV infection and not a result of a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Also, as a pulmonary neutrophilia did not develop in the control cats, the neutrophilia observed in FIV-infected cats is not a result of the sequential BAL. A neutrophilia in the BAL population has been reported in cats during the asymptomatic stage (range 8 months to 4 years) of FIV infection (Hawkins et al., 1996) that is similar to the neutrophilia reported in later stages of HIV infection (Agostini et al., 1991b) . Cadore et al. (Cadore et al., 1997) also reported a neutrophilic alveolitis in cats naturally infected with FIV and suffering from a number of secondary complications. The mechanism that regulates the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung is most likely the release of macrophage-derived cytokines, perhaps in response to secondary infections. In humans, IL8 and GM\u00b1CSF have been found to be increased in patients infected with HIV-1 Denis and Ghadirian, 1994) . In this study, we did not speci\u00aecally evaluate chemokine expression from AM; however, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the constitutive cytokine release exhibited by AM from FIV-infected cats (TNFa, IL6, IL10, IFNg) would also include IL8, GM\u00b1CSF, and other chemokines.",

This could be related to the level of virus expression in the lung of cats versus the expression of viral antigens in the lung of HIV-infected patients. Although this study quantitated FIV-gag mRNA expression in puri\u00aeed AM, determination of actual antigen expression and location within the lung was not performed. While Ma et al. (1995) identi\u00aeed FIV mRNA by in situ hybridization in only a small fraction (1 in 10,000) of the total BAL cell population, studies to determine the extent of FIV antigens present in interstitial lung tissue have not been reported. An alternative possibility is that the CD8 pulmonary lymphocytosis characteristic of HIV-infected patients is a response to subclinical secondary pulmonary infections that would not occur in FIV-infected SPF cats maintained in isolation facilities. In support of this, Cadore et al. (1997) described an interstitial pneumonitis in cats naturally infected with FIV and suffering from a variety of other infectious disease complications. The pneumonitis was characterized by a neutrophilic and lymphocytic alveolitis. We also have recently observed that FIVinfected cats do have large numbers of activated CD8 cells in the circulation that are not observed in the lungs unless they are exposed to a secondary pulmonary pathogen. Following exposure of FIV-infected cats to T. gondii, there is a rapid in\u00afux (1\u00b13 days) of activated CD8 cells into the pulmonary compartment that is not seen in normal cats challenged with T. gondii (unpublished observations).",

Expression of IL6, IL10, and TNFa mRNA was initially upregulated during the acute stage infection and then decreased to near control levels by 16 weeks post-FIV infection. Elaboration of bioactive TNFa and IL6 proteins was still evident at 16 weeks post-infection. As this experiment was interrupted at 16 weeks post-FIV infection, it is not known if the low level of constitutive TNFa and IL6 activity would remain or eventually return to normal levels. However, Levy et al. (1998) reported elevated expression of TNFa mRNA in lymph node cells from FIV-infected cats as long as 12 months post-infection. Alveolar macrophages (AM) from clinically healthy (asymptomatic) or diseased (ARC, AIDS) HIV-infected patients produced constitutive TNFa bioactive protein throughout the course of HIV infection (Israel-Biet et al., 1991; Krishnan et al., 1990; Millar et al., 1991) . In contrast to the rise and fall of TNFa, IL6 and IL10 mRNA levels, IFNg mRNA expression by AM from FIVinfected cats continued to increase throughout the experiment.",

            "text": "For these experiments, plastic adherence was utilized for puri\u00aecation of AM from other BAL cell populations (eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes). Whereas AM purity was con\u00aermed by differential analysis (at least 95%), there remains a possibility that a cell type other than the AM is responsible for the IFNg expression. Contaminating lymphocytes would seem to be the leading candidate; however, lymphocytes were only rarely, if ever, demonstrated on post-plastic adherence differentials. The predominant contaminating cell type were eosinophils. Eosinophils have been demonstrated to elaborate IFNg mRNA in some model systems (Woerly et al., 1999) ; however, the levels of IFNg mRNA demonstrated in the puri\u00aeed AM culture were independent of the level (5% or less) of eosinophilic contamination. For this reason coupled with the precedent of macrophage derived IFNg in the literature (Munder et al., 1998; Nugent et al., 1985) , AM were considered the most-likely source of the IFNg mRNA. The increase in IFNg mRNA in AM is similar to that reported in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes of HIV-infected patients (Graziosi et al., 1994; Graziosi et al., 1996; Than et al., 1997) and FIV-infected cats (Levy et al., 1998; Dean and Pedersen, 1998) . It has yet to be determined if AM from HIV-infected patients constitutively produce IFNg. If subsequent studies show that the AM is in fact not the source of the IFNg mRNA, this should not diminish the fact that signi\u00aecant IFNg mRNA levels were only detected in the FIV-infected cats. It is also possible that the increased cytokine production by AM from the FIV-infected cat was due to in vitro manipulation of previously sensitized cells. However, AM from normal cats were collected and cultured in vitro in parallel to those from the FIV-infected cats, supporting our conclusions that the elevated cytokine production in the latter group is due to FIV infection and not an artifact of culture. Alveolar macrophages (AM)from most FIV-infected cats lost their ability to produce IL12 mRNA by 16 weeks post-FIV infection. This is somewhat different from HIV infection, where AM exhibit low level constitutive production of IL12 (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994) . Despite the constitutive production of IL12, HIV-infected AM stimulated with S. aureus do not increase IL12 production as do control AM (Denis and Ghadirian, 1994) . Similarly, Levy et al. (1998) reported that FIV-infected cats cochallenged with T. gondii did not respond with increased IL12 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes, as did T. gondii challenged control cats. Therefore, quantitation of cytokine mRNA expression in the lung and lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats indicate that susceptibility to T. gondii may be due (at least in part) to an inability to generate an IL12dependent Th1 immune response in the lung. Interestingly, the number of cats in this study without detectable IL12 mRNA expression (9/12 or 75%) correlates well with the expected mortality rate (60\u00b180%) previously reported for the FIV-NCSU 1 -T. gondii cochallenge model (Davidson et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1996) .",

In this study, FIV-gag expression that increased throughout the experiment did not correlate with TNFa or IL6 expression that peaked at 4 weeks post-FIV infection. Interestingly, IFNg was the only cytokine that was expressed with kinetics similar to the FIV-gag expression, suggesting that mechanisms regulating expression of TNFa and IL6 in AM are different from those regulating IFNg. Upregulation of cytokines was dependent upon virus replication in AM, as FIV infection of AM in vitro induced cytokine mRNA and protein synthesis, whereas exposure of AM to irradiated virus failed to induce either cytokine mRNA or protein. The progressive increase in virus burden in AM also differs markedly with transient acute stage (2\u00b14 weeks) high virus burden in plasma and PBMC (Jeng et al., 1996) . This observation supports the conjecture that macrophages may be a major virus reservoir during the asymptomatic stage of infection.",

As both HIV patients and FIV-infected cats are susceptible to intracellular pathogens, this suggests that it is not simply the appearance of protective cytokines exclusive of nonprotective cytokines, but the relative levels of the cytokines, in both quantity and timing of appearance. In support of this, the concurrent increased IL10 and decreased IL12 mRNA expression in FIV-infected cats has been shown to be predictive of susceptibility of FIV-infected cats to T. gondii (Levy et al., 1998) . The FIV-T. gondii coinfection, thus, should provide a powerful model to dissect the role of cytokines in the pulmonary immunode\u00aeciency in FIV-and HIV-infected patients.",
