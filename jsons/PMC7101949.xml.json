Both apelin and the AR are widely expressed in the body, including in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and other peripheral locations such as adipose and muscle tissues (Shin et al. 2018). Consequently, apelin is known to regulate various physiological systems. Its effects include modulation of heart contractility, vasodilation, and glucose homeostasis. In turn, its potential for therapeutic application means that apelin has been a highly sought after medicinal chemistry target (Narayanan et al. 2015).",

For example, apelin-13 rapidly dissociates from the receptor upon internalization, leading to receptor recycling (Evans et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2010). In contrast, apelin-36-AR interaction leads to receptor degradation with the ligand and receptor remaining associated upon internalization (Lee et al. 2010). This phenomenon is consistent with the higher receptor affinity reported for the longer isoform (Habata et al. 1999). These disparities mean that the ratio of apelin isoforms present in a given setting has been hypothesized to regulate the physiological effects of apelin (Lee et al. 2010).",

Consequently, apelin-55 was labeled as an inactive proprotein and apelin-77 as its preproprotein. These observations, collectively, led to the hypothesis that apelin processing occurred intracellularly, with apelin-36 produced from the 55-residue proprotein isoform, followed by subsequent processing to the shorter and more potent apelin-13 or -17 isoforms (Kleinz and Davenport 2005; Habata et al. 1999). In support of intracellular processing, co-expression of apelin and PCSK3 led to observable cleavage of apelin into shorter isoforms (Adam et al. 2016). However, the detection of intact apelin-55 in colostrum and milk (Mesmin et al. 2011) and of isoforms with mass greater than apelin-36 in plasma (Foldes et al. 2003) suggest that intracellular processing to apelin-36 is not ubiquitous. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated that apelin-55 activates the AR (Shin et al. 2017a).",

Thus, if apelin-36 is the form released from stomach cells, the detection of differing isoforms in gastric secretions implies that processing may occur extracellularly. Furthermore, while injection of apelin-36 or -13 resulted in an antithrombotic response, an apelin-36 mutant incapable of being processed by PCSKs elicited no response, indicating that apelin-36 must be processed to the 13-residue form upon injection for this activity (Adam et al. 2016).",

This proprotein convertase is expressed ubiquitously (Seidah 2011; Thomas 2002). It can be membrane-anchored through a transmembrane domain, either in the secretory pathway or on the cell surface (Teuchert et al. 1999; Mayer et al. 2003, 2004). Alternatively, it may be shed into the extracellular fluid upon transmembrane domain cleavage (Vidricaire et al. 1993; Molloy et al. 1999). Either the membrane-anchored or shed forms of PCSK3 would potentially allow for extracellular processing. This follows precedents of extracellular processing of anthrax toxin (Klimpel et al. 1992), human immunodeficiency virus type I protein Vpr (Xiao et al. 2008), pro-ADAMTS9 (Koo et al. 2006), and B-type natriuretic peptide (Semenov et al. 2010). Notably, various apelin isoforms also bind to membrane-mimetic micelles (Langelaan and Rainey 2009; Shin et al. 2017b), further increasing the likelihood of apelin-PCSK3 interactions on the cell surface through the combination of factors proposed to increase favorability of peptide-receptor interactions in the \u201cmembrane catalysis\u201d mechanism (Sargent and Schwyzer 1986).",

To test for this, we exposed exogenous hexahistidine (His6)-tagged apelin-55 to PCSK3-overexpressing human embryonic kidney (HEK293A) cells, providing a situation with a high probability of observing extracellular processing. Apelin processing was also tested upon exposure to differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which express both apelin and PCSK3 endogenously (Shin et al. 2013) and which have been extensively used to study the role of apelin in adipoinsular axis at both cellular and molecular level (Yue et al. 2011; Than et al. 2012, 2015; Masaki et al. 2012). The culture medium from each cell line was characterized through reverse phase high performance LC (RP-HPLC), electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS), and western blotting to determine both the extent and isoform specificity of extracellular apelin processing taking place in each context.",

This compound is a general PCSK inhibitor and has been previously shown to effectively inhibit processing activity of various PCSK subtypes, including PCSK3, both intracellularly and at the cell surface (Koo et al. 2006; Remacle et al. 2010). Addition of decanoyl-RVKR-CMK to the culture medium of PCSK3-overexpressing HEK293A cells decreased exogenous His-apelin-55 processing, as was evident by HPLC elution and western blotting profiles (Figs. 2, 3a). Densitometry demonstrated statistically significant inhibition with both 25 and 2.5 \u03bcM inhibitor doses (Fig. 3b); however, pretreatment with the inhibitor even at the higher of these doses did not completely block processing. Namely, despite a single apparent peak at ~19 min, a species consistent with His-apelin-55\u039432 remained detectable by ESI-MS (Table 2, Fig. S11), implying that this processing product is still present, though not observed through UV absorption-based monitoring of HPLC elution. Notably, HPLC chromatograms also exhibited a prominent elution peak at ~16 min with the addition of inhibitor (Fig. 2) with a mass consistent with His-apelin-55\u03941 (Table 2, Fig. S12; Table S2 provides all masses considered).",

This exhibited a PCSK3-dependence, as processing was increased with PCSK3 transfection and overexpression and was attenuated by PCSK inhibitor treatment. Based upon our in vitro observation of specific apelin-13 production from apelin-55 by PCSK3 (Shin et al. 2013), it is likely that apelin-13 is produced and the resulting His-apelin-55\u039413 N-terminal domain is further processed by Arg exoproteases, such as carboxypeptidase M that is found on the surface of kidney cells (Skidgel et al. 1989). This would, in turn, produce the major observed product, His-apelin-55\u039415. Consistent with a steady-state level of this truncated N-terminal domain production, the quantity of His-apelin-55\u039415 did not significantly change upon pretreatment with either PCSK3 overexpression or PCSK inhibitor treatment.",

The exact sources of the wide variety of peptide products observed are hard to determine, but are consistent with the extensive catalog of apelin peptides seen in colostrum and milk (Mesmin et al. 2011). Because none of the related apelin isoforms themselves (i.e., apelin-13, -15, -16, or -32) were detected in the medium, any additional discussion would be even more speculative in nature. However, it is important to note that the lack or low levels of observable C-terminal products is not unexpected given that bioactive C-terminal apelin peptides have been shown to undergo rapid degradation in plasma (Murza et al. 2014), and with rates of degradation by the metalloprotease neprilysin being greater for the apelin-13 and -17 isoforms relative to apelin-36 (McKinnie et al. 2016).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Vickers et al. 2002) and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) (Kehoe et al. 2016) have both been shown to remove the C-terminal Phe of apelin in vitro. This has, in turn, been linked with deactivation and regulation in the apelinergic system (Ceraudo et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016). Both ACE2 and PRCP are located on the cell surface and are expressed in kidney cells (Tipnis et al. 2000; Shariat-Madar et al. 2002); thus, either (or both) may be responsible for the observed processing upon PCSK inhibition. Observation of this processed form only in the presence of inhibitor is notable for three reasons. First, observation of a major product other than His-apelin-55\u039415, resulting from a well-characterized mechanism, unequivocally demonstrates the involvement of other proteases and underlines the non-proportional changes observed between the level of intact His-apelin-55 and new processed products. Second, it shows a direct and efficient truncation of the apelin C-terminal residue in HEK293A cell culture, likely hampering the ability to detect intact apelin isoforms. Third, the similar level of His-apelin-55\u039415 observed with inhibitor treatment relative to without, despite the presence of an additional major processing product in the presence of inhibitor, further implies that the processes involved in regulation of His-apelin-55\u039415 levels are leading to steady-state behavior.",

Such mechanisms would be highly energy intensive and are difficult to reconcile with the degree of apelin processing observed in both culture media. Correspondingly, we are unaware of such a mechanism having been previously observed. Furthermore, examples of exactly the opposite behavior have been documented, where proproteins are secreted and specifically rely on processing by cell surface PCSK3 (Koo et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2008). Receptor-mediated trafficking and subsequent intracellular processing is also unlikely to occur, given, as noted above, the negative correlation of apelin-AR dissociation to isoform length and the fact that apelin-36 exhibits a sustained receptor interaction leading to receptor degradation (Lee et al. 2010). Observation of an anionic surface on the AR extracellular domain (Ma et al. 2017) is correlated with this potential for favourable ligand-receptor binding (Shin et al. 2018). Apelin-55, thus, seems likely to follow the precedent of apelin-36 with favourable binding to the receptor that would prevent processing through steric hindrance, occlusion of the proteolytic site, and/or limiting of the quantity of free apelin-55. Furthermore, while 3T3-L1 adipocytes express AR (Attane et al. 2011), HEK293A cells do not (Bai et al. 2014a, b). An AR-mediated mechanism of internalization would thus be possible for 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but not HEK293A cells.",

Given the known differences in potency, efficacy, and in downstream effects, controlling apelin processing through the activity of specific cell surface enzymes would serve to provide an additional level of regulation in directing downstream effects. Such processing-mediated regulation may not be limited to apelin, with the recent identification of apela (ELABELA (Chng et al. 2013)/Toddler (Pauli et al. 2014)) as a second endogenous peptidic ligand for the AR. Like apelin, apela can be processed into multiple N-terminally truncated forms with isoform-dependent functional properties (Shin et al. 2018), implying the potential for similar regulation. In combination with the previously demonstrated potential of intracellular apelin processing, extracellular processing of apelinergic system ligands is indicative of the involvement of diverse mechanisms and proteases in regulation of the apelinergic system.",
