Our findings are consistent with those of a recent COVID-19 study demonstrating that frontline nurses had significantly lower vicarious traumatization scores than non-frontline nurses and the general public (5) . Reasons for this may include reduced accessibility to formal psychological support, less first-hand medical information on the outbreak, less intensive training on personal protective equipment and infection control measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 331, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "As the pandemic continues, important clinical and policy strategies are needed to support health care workers.

First, data obtained from selfreported questionnaires were not verified with medical records. Second, the study did not assess socioeconomic status, which may be helpful in evaluating associations of outcomes and tailoring specific interventions. Finally, the study was performed early in the outbreak and only in Singapore, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Follow-up studies could help assess for progression or even a potential rebound effect of psychological manifestations once the imminent threat of COVID-19 subsides.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study highlights that nonmedical health care personnel are at highest risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Early psychological interventions targeting this vulnerable group may be beneficial. DASS-21 = Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales; IES-R = Impact of Events Scale-Revised; PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder. * The DASS-21 is a 21-item system that provides independent measures of depression, stress, and anxiety with recommended severity thresholds. Cutoff scores >9, >7, and >14 indicate a positive screen for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. The IES-R is a 22-item self-report instrument that measures the subjective distress caused by traumatic events. It has 3 subscales (intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal), which are closely affiliated with PTSD symptoms. A total IES-R cutoff score of 24 is used to classify PTSD as a clinical concern. \u2020 Adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, presence of comorbid conditions, and survey completion date. The adjusted prevalence ratio was derived from logistic regression models by calculating marginally adjusted prevalence for each group. The 95% CIs were derived by using the delta method. The adjusted mean difference was obtained by using linear regression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Updates on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) local situation.
