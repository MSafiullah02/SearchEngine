A novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) was identified as the cause of the infections (Zhu et al., 2020) and has since spread worldwide. As of May 7, 2020, more than 3.6 million cases of COVID-19 (illness caused by SARS-COV-2) have been reported in 184 countries and territories, including \u223c250,000 deaths (Dong et al., 2020, World Health Organization, 2020). The pandemic has overwhelmed both national and local healthcare capacity in several countries (Ferguson et al., 2020, Kissler et al., 2020), and is projected to do so in many others. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable (Walker et al., 2020), since financial and logistical challenges may hinder their ability to augment treatment capacity. As such, many countries have resorted to societal-wide social distancing interventions in the hopes of reducing morbidity and delaying the demand for healthcare resources, in order to gain time to increase treatment capacity.",

While informative, these efforts have been limited to specific nations and snapshots in time and public health officials are reliant on the authors for updated estimates as the pandemic evolves. Other internet-based tools offer public health users the ability to generate estimates on their own, but these are limited in their practical utility because their assumptions and desired results may not match the specific needs of jurisdictions and public health decision makers, or they require coding knowledge to access or modify the calculations (Healthcare, 2020, Henderson, 2020). These considerations are more critical in low and middle-income countries, which may not have the resources to complete or modify such analyses on their own.",

The model requires information that is typically available for public health officials, including the number of cases in their jurisdiction, the size and demographics of their at-risk population, healthcare capacity, expectations for healthcare use, and choices of societal-wide social-distancing mitigation strategies users wish to evaluate. Model outputs reflect the potential demand on the healthcare system due to severely ill individuals with and without user-specified mitigation strategies, as well as deaths averted through treatment and excess deaths due to healthcare demand exceeding capacity. The demand for healthcare resources is measured as the estimated number of CoVID-19 patients requiring critical-care or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, hospital beds (non-ICU), and mechanical ventilators over the course of the outbreak and the maximum occupancy at the outbreak\u2019s peak. The tool offers users the ability to evaluate various intervention strategies currently under consideration and in use worldwide (Ferguson et al., 2020, Kissler et al., 2020, Willem et al., 2020). These interventions comprise five mitigation-type interventions which focus on slowing epidemic spread and reducing its burden on the healthcare system, and one suppression-type strategy, which employs aggressive interventions aimed at reversing epidemic growth (Table 1\n).",

            "text": "Our SEIR model tracks the number of individuals transitioning between disease states every day of the outbreak. The initial number of susceptible individuals is set as the population minus the cumulative number infected since the outbreak\u2019s start. Transmission occurs through contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals and we assume an equal probability any one person has contact with another (\u201chomogenous mixing\u201d). We also assume transmission chains generated by infected travelers entering the population are minimal compared to existing transmission in the community. As a result, the number of new infections each day is the product of the proportion of the population that is susceptible, the number of infectious persons on a given day, and the average number of new infections each infected person causes over the span of their illness (the reproduction number; hereafter, \u201cR\u201d) divided by the duration (in days) of the average infectious period. Infectiousness is assumed to occur five days after infection (Lauer et al., 2020) and lasts 11 days (You et al., 2020). Upon recovery from infection, individuals are assumed immune to re-infection during the timespan modeled (through December 2020). In the absence of intervention R is 2.0 (low estimate) and 2.8 (high estimate), approximately spanning the middle 50% of the gamma distribution of R (95% intervals: 1.4-3.8) estimated from the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan (Li et al., 2020, Riou and Althaus, 2020). To account for uncertainty in R, all results are depicted as a range based on these low and high estimates for R. During time periods where interventions are applied, we reduce the low and high estimates of R by the values in Table 1. Upon mitigation concluding, R returns to pre-mitigation levels to illustrate the potential consequences of shorter duration interventions. However, advanced users can alter the tool so that when one mitigation strategy concludes, another begins. Finally, we do not account for any vaccine as it is only likely to be available beyond the modeled time frame (Li and De Clercq, 2020, Nature, 2020). All equations governing dynamics of the system are provided in the supplementary material.",

We calculate hospital (non-ICU) bed occupancy based on a ten day length of stay for patients treated entirely in non-critical hospital wards (Deng et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020b) and ICU bed occupancy based on a ten day length of stay when critical care is required (Verity et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020a). We assume a four day lag from hospital admission to ICU admission (Wang et al., 2020b, Zhang et al., 2020a). When mechanical ventilation is required, we assume the duration of use is nine days, based on expert clinical opinion that ventilation is necessary for the duration of ICU stays other than two days (one-day lag post ICU admission to initiate ventilator use plus 1 day in the ICU post-use) and another day required for ventilator cleaning/re-equipping.",

The results of our illustrative scenario underscore the need for policymakers to take immediate and aggressive actions, and if they do so, substantial morbidity and mortality may be averted. As more data become available (e.g. new treatments or healthcare capacity is augmented) and the pandemic evolves (e.g. COVID case counts), our tool permits rapid updating of results applicable for making decisions.",
