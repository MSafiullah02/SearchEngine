According to a series of studies published recently by the Lancet, 80% of the 35 million deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases in 2005, occurred in low-income and middle-income countries. Achievement of the global goal of reducing chronic disease death rates by 2% every year would save billions of dollars and avert 36 million deaths between 2005 and 2015 mainly in developing countries (Abegunde et al., 2007) . A report of the World Bank, concentrating on the economic benefit of tuberculosis control in the 22 countries with the highest burden of TB, has shown that, moving from no DOTS to sustained DOTS in a global plan strategy between 2006 and 2015, will yield a benefit of US$ 129 billion quasi-totally in developing countries (Laxminarayan et al., 2007) .

Cardio-Vascular Disease is the name for the group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and includes: hypertension (high blood pressure), coronary heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathies. An estimated 17.5 million deaths were caused by these diseases in 2005, representing 30% of all deaths occurring in the world. Ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease together, caused more than 13 million deaths, whereas hypertensive and other heart conditions were responsible for an additional 4 million deaths. If the present trend is not reversed or at least stopped, some 20 million people will die from CVDs by 2015. Once associated with rich and industrialized nations, CVDs are now seriously affecting developing countries. Nearly 80% of CVD deaths occur in developing countries where they are expected to be the leading cause of death by 2010. In some countries of the East Mediterranean Region 40% of all deaths are caused by CVDs (Alwan, 1997; Boutayeb and Boutayeb, 2005; Tazi et al., 2003) . Among the 20 ''lucky'' million people who survive annually heart attacks and stroke, a number of ''unlucky'' survivals are living in developing countries where they cannot afford the continuing costly treatment and clinical care. Beyond mortality figures, CVDs are also imposing a huge disease burden. More than 85% of the global CVD burden happens in developing countries. In general, theses diseases strike people in their mid-life years, affecting their productivity, undermining the family budget .

The future is more alarming since it is predicted that, between 2000 and 2020, the number of cases will increase by 73% in developing countries compared to a 29% increase in developed countries. While the incidence and prevalence of some sites of cancer such as breast and cervical cancer have regressed in developed countries, they still have devastating consequences in developing countries mainly due to late detection. Other types such as lung cancer are exponentially exploding as a consequence of increase in the use of tobacco and alcohol. Finally, many types of cancer such as colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are ''flourishing'' in developing countries due to the multidimensional transition, in which most developing countries are completely or partially engaged, and its corollaries on inadequate diet and physical inactivity (Boutayeb and Boutayeb, 2005 ).",

Despite its chronic nature affecting some 600 million people, and the fact that it is the fifth and sixth leading cause of death in high and low-income countries respectively, COPD is thought to be overlooked, under-diagnosed, under-treated and under-funded, and also neglected by the public, pharmaceutical industry and physician alike when compared to other major killers such as cardiovascular disease and stroke (The Lancet, 2007) . If urgent and efficient actions are not taken, COPD will be the third leading cause of death by 2020.

In particular, the transition from a rural to an urban lifestyle and its corollary of nutrition transition characterized by a higher energy density diet with a greater role for fat and added sugar in foods, greater saturated fat intake mostly from animal sources, reduced intakes of fiber, fruit and vegetables (WHO, 2003c).",

It is the case of preventable sexually transmitted diseases (STD) which caused in 1999, about 350 million infections in the population aged 15-49. However, knowing the correlation existing between STD and HIV/AIDS, health policy makers should be very careful. An illustrative example is given by the case of North African countries, known to have high prevalence of STD and, so far, relatively saved from high prevalence of HIV/AIDS but the increasing trend may explode rapidly (Boutayeb, 2006) . Congenital syphilis is still endemic in many African countries. An estimated 4 million cases occurred in 1999 among adults in sub-Sahara Africa, a similar number of cases was recorded in south and south-east Asia and 3 million cases took place in Latin America and the Caribbean (Berman, 2003; Hawkes et al., 2003; Peeling and Ye, 2003; Schmidt, 2003) . It is worth stressing that all these cases are happening while tools of prevention have been available for decades.",

On top of natural catastrophes, poverty, wars and conflicts, these countries are exposed to a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases with alarming trends. Some diseases like tuberculosis are both causes and consequences of poverty. Other diseases like diabetes and cardio vascular diseases are more associated with different transition forms (demographic, economic, geographic and epidemiological) in which middle income countries are engaged. Globally, however, the double action of communicable and noncommunicable diseases constitute serious impediments to economic development by reducing productivity, setting aside saving possibilities and slowing economic growth in general. They also obstruct human development by their negative action on life expectancy, education and socio-economic status in general. The economic cost of care for noncommunicable diseases such as CVDs, diabetes, COPD and cancer is huge. The adequate treatment for communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is beyond the capacity of most developing countries. In the main time, diseases are causing the loss of billions of dollars in terms of non productivity, absenteeism and skill. The global disease impact has a special feature in developing countries since most of the diseases affect either children or adults in their most productive part of life. Consequently, life expectancy, education, income and all human development components are affected by communicable and/or noncommunicable in developing countries. The disease burden is a major problem for health public and a real global concern for the whole economic and human development (Malawi, 2005; South Africa, 2003; UNESCO, 2007; UNICEF, 2005; Zimbabwe, 2003) .",
