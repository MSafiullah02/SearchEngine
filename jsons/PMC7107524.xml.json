Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed using the outcomes of pulmonary complications and death in the 3-month post\u2013RVI-onset period. These models were limited by few pulmonary complications and death events; however, the following factors were hypothesized a priori to be potentially associated with these outcomes: age, need for respiratory support at baseline, and history of chronic lung disease. Each of these variables was assessed in a univariate logistic regression analysis and then included in multivariate logistic regression models. Statistical calculations were performed using Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).",

RVI occurred at the highest rates after an intestine/abdominal multivisceral (38%) transplant, followed by heart (18.3%), lung (16.7%), liver (15.6%), and kidney (5.5%) transplant. The earliest RVI event occurred at a median of 99 days after transplant (IQR, 19\u2013236 days), with minimal variability in timing across viruses (Table 2). Of the 181 RVI events in the cohort, rhinovirus occurred most frequently (82 events [45%]), followed by RSV (40 [22%]), PIV (29 [16%]), hMPV (20 [11%]), and influenza (19 [10%]). Coinfection with 2 viruses occurred in 9 RVI events, including 5 cases of rhinovirus with either hMPV [3] or PIV [2] and 4 cases of RSV with hMPV, influenza, PIV, or rhinovirus. Infection with hMPV, influenza, and RSV occurred primarily during autumn and winter, whereas PIV and rhinovirus occurred throughout the calendar year (Table 3 and Figure 1). PIV3 (n = 18) predominated, occurring throughout the year, whereas PIV1 (n = 5) and PIV2 (n = 6) clustered in the fall and winter months, respectively. Clinical signs most frequently associated with respiratory virus detection included fever within 48 hours (54%) and lower respiratory tract disease at onset (35%). Fever was most common with influenza (79%) and least common with hMPV, PIV, and RSV (43%\u201345%). During the first RVI event for the 159 patients with at least 1 RVI, only 9% of the patients were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, <500 cells/mL) and 22% were severely lymphopenic (absolute lymphocyte count, <200 cells/mL) in the week before onset. However, absolute lymphocyte counts before RVI onset were not available for 28% of the patients. Underlying chronic lung disease, the need for respiratory support including oxygen, noninvasive or mechanical ventilation, and admission in an intensive care unit before RVI diagnosis were all relatively common (20%, 25%, and 28%, respectively).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of a multicenter pediatric cohort in which hospital-associated RVI in the first year after SOT was evaluated. Overall, 14.5% of pediatric SOT recipients had at least 1 documented RVI that required hospitalization within 12 months of their transplant; the highest rate of RVI was seen in intestine/abdominal multivisceral transplant recipients, and the lowest rate occurred in kidney transplant recipients. The overall incidence was similar to the RVI rate (14%) reported from a previous study of a large cohort of pediatric lung transplant recipients [10], despite the fact that the earlier cohort was evaluated before the routine availability of molecular diagnostics. Rhinovirus accounted for 45% of the events in our cohort, which is consistent with recent reports of RVI etiologies in adult SOT recipients [12, 13] and is a substantial increase over rates from studies before the initiation of molecular diagnostics.",

            "text": "Death after RVI was relatively uncommon in this study, occurring during 4% of the first RVI events, and only 2 of these deaths were deemed possibly or likely related to the RVI. Comparison of this mortality rate to those in previously published literature suggests a decline in the mortality rate after RVI among SOT recipients. Data from a single-center cohort assembled during the 1990s revealed a case-fatality rate of 15% to 23% for influenza and PIV [14]. It should be noted that follow-up among 83 pediatric SOT recipients with influenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic who were generally treated with antiviral therapy revealed no deaths [15]. The aforementioned multicenter pediatric lung transplant cohort reported a case-fatality rate of 10.7% among 28 patients with an RVI [16]. However, 2 of the 3 deaths in the cohort of lung transplant recipients occurred after adenovirus infection, which was not evaluated in our study and might have resulted in a reduced estimate of the mortality rate, because adenovirus is associated with increased risk of death in some populations of pediatric transplant recipients [16, 17]. The decision to exclude adenovirus infection from our study was related to its ability to disseminate and result in systemic illness, which sets it apart from a typical RVI.",

Pediatric kidney transplants from living donors might have been scheduled to occur in periods of lower risk for RVI, such as summer months, although we do not have data to specifically support this supposition, because institutional approval for this study required anonymized data not including the date of transplantation. Because RVI events in this cohort occurred in periods that mirrored RVI circulation in the community, with a decreased number of events in the summer months, this could decrease the risk of early RVI and hospital-associated RVI because the risk of hospitalization decreased with time from transplant in this population. Another possible hypothesis would be that differences in immunosuppression protocols for the recipients of living-donor grafts had an effect.",

Compared to previous literature that provided cases in SOT but did not acquire full denominator data [8], our large cohort enables calculation of RVI incidence rates, because all pediatric SOT recipients at the participating institutions were included. However, our results must be interpreted in view of certain limitations. Given the retrospective nature of the study, no protocols for consistent evaluation for RVI were followed, even when patients were admitted to the hospital with a respiratory illness. In addition, misclassification bias was possible, although all charts were reviewed systematically to decrease this possibility. RVI events that occurred in an outpatient setting and did not necessitate a hospital admission were not captured, and it is known that many SOT recipients receive outpatient care at clinics outside the transplant center. Patients who are doing well and further out from transplant might be more likely to receive care at a center farther from the transplant center. Thus, capture of only inpatient events might have underestimated the true rate of RVI in this population. Specific data regarding acute transplant rejection were not collected for the cohort, which limited our potential to evaluate the possible association of RVI with subsequent rejection or intensified immunosuppression. Last, although a large cohort was assembled and the evaluations of patients with a variety of transplanted organs were included, the number of RVI and subsequent events of pulmonary complications and death were still relatively small, which limited our ability to identify significant risk factors for a poor outcome in multivariate analyses.",
