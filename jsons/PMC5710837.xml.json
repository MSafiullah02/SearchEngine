Virus genome replication and transcription are catalyzed by virally encoded polymerases. Although all these enzymes show some homology and share structural features and their catalytic mechanism, they also have important differences that reflect diverse virus replication strategies.",

These viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that share with eukaryotic DNA polymerases the characteristic fingers-palm-thumb subdomain arrangement. However, they show unique extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains that contribute to the formation of a well-defined template channel (Peersen, 2017, Lu and Gong, 2017). The poliovirus polymerase is the smallest viral polymerase and recent studies have been focused on how to modulate its fidelity of RNA synthesis, as a potential strategy to use in the development of attenuated vaccines (Peersen, 2017). Norovirus polymerases share a very similar structure, and it has received attention as a target of drugs currently in development. In their review, Deval et al. (2017) discuss on nucleoside analogues (e.g. ribavirin, favipiravir, 2\u2032-C-methyl-cytidine) and nonnucleoside RdRp inhibitors (e.g. suramin) active in vitro against the human norovirus polymerase.",

Viral proteins such as nsp1 and a 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 exonuclease (nsp14) have been identified as important components of nidovirus replication complexes.

Herpes simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus encode B family DNA polymerases (UL30 and UL54, respectively), whose structure and function is described in the review by Zarrouk et al. (2017). These are multifunctional enzymes with DNA polymerase, 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 exonucleotide proofreading and ribonuclease H activities, that act in complex with processivity factors. The crystal structure of the UL30 polymerase has been determined in its apoenzyme form, although valuable information has been also inferred from its extensive homology with the bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase. Studies on the vaccinia virus polymerase (a poxvirus representative) are covered in the last review of the special issue (Czarnecki and Traktman, 2017). As in herpesvirus, the vaccinia virus polymerase (E9) associates with a processivity factor that in this case is a heterodimer containing a protein A20 and uracyl DNA glycosylase. The crystal structure of a truncated form of this heterodimer is available, but the structure of E9 has not been solved. The review by Czarnecki and Traktman (2017) provides a historical account of 40 years of research on poxvirus polymerases, including relevant aspects on how viral and host factors modulate their activity.",
