            "text": "Type I interferon (IFN) and NF-\u03baB pathways play key roles in controlling disease pathogenesis (Goubau et al., 2013, Paludan and Bowie, 2013, Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). The innate immune response serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by several classes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (Goubau et al., 2013, Paludan and Bowie, 2013, Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). Activation of most TLRs leads to the recruitment of a common adaptor molecule, MyD88, which acts on a series of downstream signaling molecules to trigger the NF-\u03baB pathway (Goubau et al., 2013, Hayden and Ghosh, 2008, Paludan and Bowie, 2013), whereas stimulation of TLR7 and TLR9 in specialized plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can trigger robust MyD88-dependent IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 transcription factor-mediated type I IFN signaling and produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) in response to viral infection (Liu, 2005, Wang et al., 2011). By contrast, activation of cytosolic RNA sensors (RIG-I and MDA5) recruits the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) adaptor protein, while stimulation of DNA sensors recruits stimulator of IFN genes (STING), which both result in triggering IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling (Goubau et al., 2013, Paludan and Bowie, 2013, Sun et al., 2013, Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). Innate immune responses must be tightly regulated to maintain immune balance, but how these signaling pathways are regulated in vivo, particularly in response to malaria infection, remains unresolved.",

            "text": "Malaria is a deadly infectious disease and is responsible for up to 0.5 million deaths each year (Miller et al., 2013). Lack of effective vaccines against malaria has been one of the major limiting factors in controlling the disease (Riley and Stewart, 2013). The incomplete understanding of the malaria-strain-specific response and regulatory mechanisms impedes our ability to develop effective malaria vaccines (Langhorne et al., 2008, Riley and Stewart, 2013, Stevenson and Riley, 2004). Recent studies show that the liver stage of infection can induce type I IFN signaling activation, either through the cytosolic PRRs, MDA5-MAVS pathway (Liehl et al., 2014), or multiple mechanisms (Miller et al., 2014). After the liver stage of infection and expansion, merozoites are released into the blood and infect red blood cells (iRBCs), which activate several key signaling pathways, including NF-\u03baB, type I IFN, and the inflammasome (Gazzinelli et al., 2014, Miller et al., 2014, Riley and Stewart, 2013, Wu et al., 2014). However, the role of TLRs and type I IFN in malaria blood-stage infection is unclear or remain controversial (Baccarella et al., 2013, Gowda et al., 2012, Haque et al., 2014, Liehl and Mota, 2012, Sharma et al., 2011, Togbe et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2010). Therefore, we have used a lethal malaria plasmodium yoelii YM (YM for short) strain as a model to probe the molecular signaling pathways and mechanisms of host immune response during blood stage infection.",

Our experiments further revealed that the STING- and MAVS-mediated type I IFN pathway induced SOCS1 expression, which potently inhibited MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Furthermore, we showed that early robust IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production by pDCs in genetically ablated mice during the first 24 hr of YM infection subsequently activated cDCs and macrophages, which, in turn, induced T- and B-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses against malaria infection.",

However, mice with ablation of the Ddx58 gene (coding for RIG-I) showed no difference in malaria parasitemia and host death, compared with WT mice (Figure S1E). IRF3 is a key factor for stimulating type I IFN signaling for IFN-\u03b2 production in almost all cell types, whereas IRF7 is responsible for activating type I IFN signaling to produce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 only in pDCs (Liu, 2005, Wang et al., 2011). Infection of Irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 and Irf7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with YM revealed that Irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not Irf7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, remarkably reduced parasitemia and were resistant to YM infection (Figures 1H and 1I). Collectively, these results suggest that activation of cGAS-STING and MDA5-MAVS-mediated IRF3-dependent type I IFN signaling leads to a lethal phenotype of YM infection.",

We found that both purified YM gDNA and RNA could induce IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells (Figure S1G), which is in agreement with other studies showing that malaria RNA can be detected by a MDA5 sensor (Liehl et al., 2014, Wu et al., 2014). As expected, in vitro stimulation with YM gDNA or RNA showed impaired or completely abolished activation of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA and protein in bone-marrow-derived conventional DCs (cDCs) from MDA5-, MAVS-, and STING-deficient mice compared to cDCs from WT mice (Figure S1H). Although STING has been shown to play an important role in the host response to AT-rich malarial DNA (Sharma et al., 2011), it is not clear which DNA sensors are responsible for recognizing YM gDNA and activating STING-mediated type I IFN signaling. To this end, we transfected 293T-STING stable cells with plasmids containing the gene encoding one of four putative DNA sensors (cGAS, DAI, DDX41, or IFI16) followed by YM gDNA stimulation. Ectopic expression of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression after YM gDNA treatment (Figure 1J). Consistently, silencing of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, by specific siRNAs in RAW264.7 cells markedly reduced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA and protein after YM gDNA treatment (Figures 1K, 1L, and S1I), suggesting that cGAS functions as a DNA sensor for detecting YM gDNA and inducing STING-mediated type I IFN signaling.",

WT mice treated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 after YM infection had markedly decreased parasitemia and host mortality, but treatment with IL-6 or IFN-\u03b3 failed to do so (Figure 2\nA). Since the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in serum peaked at 24 hr after YM infection and then disappeared, we asked whether the timing of cytokine treatment was important for protective immunity. We performed similar experiments with cytokine injections at different time points and found that the amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated protection were the highest at 18 hr after YM infection, intermediate at 32 hr, and the lowest at 48 hr (Figure 2B).

As the first step, we asked whether IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated activation of IFNAR (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor) is required for controlling parasitemia and host mortality. We blocked type I IFN signaling in Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice by administering anti-IFNAR1 antibody. Although anti-IFNAR1 treatment did not have much effect on the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6 in Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S2A), the Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice treated with anti-IFNAR1 antibody with a single injection at 1 day before infection (i.e., day \u22121) or four injections at days \u22121, 2, 4, and 6 showed increased parasitemias and died around day 15 (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2B), suggesting that the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated downstream signaling pathway is critical in controlling parasitemia and host mortality. To further test whether IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced immunity requires IFNAR and its downstream signaling, we infected Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with YM and found comparable low amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 in serum compared with those in WT mice (Figure S2C).

As expected, serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 were very high in Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice. However, we could not detect any IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the sera of Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212:Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212:Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt:Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212 mice or in the sera of Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 3\nA, S3A, and S3B), suggesting a critical role for MyD88 in the rapid production of high amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to YM infection. Consistent with these data, MyD88 ablation sensitized Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice to high parasitemia and host lethality (Figures 3B, S3C, and S3D). These results suggest that the rapid production of high amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice after YM infection is MyD88 dependent.",

To this end, we infected WT mice with YM and isolated cDCs, macrophages, and pDCs at 18 hr post infection to detect malaria 18S rRNA by PCR with malaria-specific primers. We found that malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in pDCs, but not in macrophages and cDCs (Figure S4A), suggesting that only pDCs are involved in detecting YM infection within the first 18 hr. To directly demonstrate that pDCs are the major source of type I IFN cytokine production, we depleted pDCs in WT, Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice by injection of mPDCA-1 antibody at 12 hr before and 12 hr after YM infection. Depletion of pDCs significantly reduced serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in WT and deficient mice compared with control antibody treatment (Figure 4\nA). Similar results were obtained in Mb21d1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S4B), suggesting that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are primarily produced by pDCs. Importantly, pDC depletion by mPDCA-1 treatment markedly increased parasitemias and mortality in Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt mice infected with YM compared with control antibody-treated mice (Figures 4B and 4C).

To test this possibility, we examined the expression pattern of several negative regulators in splenocytes from YM-infected WT and deficient mice, and found that the mRNA amounts of Socs1, Socs3, Inpp5d (coding for SHIP1), and Inppl1 (coding for SHIP2) were markedly increased in WT but were little or low in MDA5-, MAVS-, and STING-deficient splenocytes (Figures 5\nA and S5A). Downregulation of Socs1 was also observed in cGAS-deficient mice (Figure S5B). By contrast, we did not observe appreciable changes in the expression of other potential negative regulators, such as Otud5, Gsk3b, Nlrc3, Pcbp2, Ube3c, and Rnf5, between YM-infected WT and deficient mice (Figure S5A). To further assess the expression of these negative regulators in pDCs, we purified pDCs from Flt3L-induced bone-morrow-derived DCs of WT and deficient mice by flow cytometry (Figure S5C) and then stimulated them with YM RNA or gDNA. SOCS1 was the only negative regulator showing a marked increase in gene expression in WT pDCs but significantly lower gene expression in Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt pDCs (Figures 5B and 5C). No appreciable differences in expression of other negative regulators Socs3, Inpp5d, and Inppl1 were observed between WT and deficient pDCs after YM RNA or gDNA stimulation (Figure S5D). To further substantiate these findings, we purified pDCs, macrophages, and cDCs from YM-infected WT and Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (18 hr after infection) and then directly assessed SOCS1 expression in these cells, and we found that SOCS1 mRNA abundance in pDCs from WT mice were significantly higher than pDCs from Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5D). Notably, we did not detect any difference in expression of SOCS1 in macrophages and cDCs from WT and Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5D). Importantly, SOCS1 mRNA abundance was inversely correlated with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression in pDCs from YM-infected WT and Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 5E and 5F).

To determine whether SOCS1 directly interacts with MyD88, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of 293T cells expressing Socs1 plus Myd88, Irak1, or Irak4, and we found that SOCS1 directly interacted with MyD88 (Figure 5G), in addition to IRAK1. To determine whether STING-, MDA5-, and MAVS-induced SOCS1 are responsible for inhibition of MyD88-dependent type I IFN production in pDCs, we silenced Socs1, Socs3, Inpp5d, and Inppl1 in WT pDCs by siRNA transfection (Figure S6A) and then determined IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production after YM RNA and gDNA stimulation. Only silencing of Socs1 resulted in a significant increase in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA, as well as IFN-\u03b2 protein after YM RNA and gDNA stimulation (Figures S6B and S6C), suggesting that STING- or MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling induces SOCS1 expression, which, in turn, inhibits MyD88-dependent type I IFN production in pDCs.",

Due to neonatal mortality and the complex inflammatory pathology of Socs1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, the in vivo role of SOCS1 in response to malaria infection could not be addressed. Hence, we first silenced the Socs1 gene in WT mice with Socs1-specific siRNA (Figures 6\nA and S6D). As expected, silencing of Socs1 increased IFN-\u03b3 production through its inhibitory effect on JAK1. We also found increased serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 compared with scrambled siRNA-treated WT mice after YM infection (Figure 6B). Importantly, silencing of Socs1 resulted in reduction of parasitemia and increased survival of WT mice after YM infection compared with control mice (Figure 6C). To further confirm these observations, we genetically ablated the Socs1 gene in WT bone marrow cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and then we generated chimeric mice (Figures S6E and S6F). SOCS1-deficient chimeric mice produced high amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, reduced parasitemia, and increased survival after YM infection (Figures S6G and S6H). These results suggest that silencing or genetic deletion of Socs1 relieves its inhibition of the MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, thus leading to the control of parasitemia and host survival.",

We found that depletion of pDCs with anti-mPDCA-1 in Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice during the cytokine production phase (24 hr before infection) markedly reduced IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production; however, depletion of pDCs after 24 hr of infection had no effect on IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production compared with mice treated with a control antibody (Figure 7B).

Macrophage depletion in Tmem173\ngt mice did not affect serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, regardless of depletion at 2 days before or 1 day after YM infection (Figure 7D). However, macrophage depletion during the effector phase (at 1 day post infection) markedly increased parasitemia and host mortality compared with a liposome control or treatment at 2 days before infection (Figure 7E), suggesting a critical role of macrophages during the effector phase, but not during the cytokine production phase. To determine the relative role of cDCs in anti-malaria immunity, we generated Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212:Zbtb46-DTR (zinc figure transcription factor-driven DTR expression in cDCs) mice. As expected in a previous study (Meredith et al., 2012), DT injection into Zbtb46-DTR bone marrow chimeras resulted in specific depletion of cDCs in 12 hr and maintained depletion for 5 days. Thus, we injected DT into Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212:Zbtb46-DTR chimeric mice at 4 days before or at 1 day post infection. We found that there was no change in the serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 when DT was injected either before or after YM infection (Figure 7F), suggesting that cDCs are not responsible for the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production during the early phase (24 hr) of infection. However, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212:Zbtb46-DTR mice treated with DT after 24 hr of infection showed increased parasitemia and died sooner after infection compared to untreated mice or mice treated with DT at 4 days before infection (Figure 7G), suggesting that cDCs are required for generating protective immunity during the effector phase. Consistent with these results, we also found that malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in pDCs, but not in macrophages or cDCs, at 18 hr post infection. However, malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in macrophages and cDCs of Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 3 post infection (Figure S7B), suggesting that pDCs are the major cell population that sense and detect YM infection within the first 24 hr, whereas macrophages and cDCs are involved in the detection of YM infection at later time points for the induction of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that pDCs, but not macrophages or cDCs, are critically required for the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the first 24 hr after YM infection, whereas macrophages and cDCs are required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced immunity against YM after 24 hr post infection.",

To test this possibility, we infected WT and Rag2-deficient mice, which lack B and T cells, with YM in the presence or absence of exogenous murine recombinant IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Although cytokine-treated WT and Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated reduced parasitemia compared with untreated WT and Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, we found no differences in the percent of parasitemia between WT and Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice either in untreated groups or cytokine-treated groups in the first 5 days after infection (Figure 7H). However, after 7 days post infection, parasitemia in cytokine-treated Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice markedly increased to the amounts observed in untreated WT or untreated Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures 7H and 7I). WT untreated, Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 untreated, and Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 cytokine-treated mice died within 8 days after YM infection, whereas cytokine-treated WT mice maintained significantly lower parasitemia than the other three groups and survived beyond 8 days (Figure 7I), suggesting that B and T cells are required for generating adaptive immunity to control parasitemia and clear parasites at a later time. To further understand cellular and molecular basis of YM-induced adaptive immunity in WT and Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, we infected WT and Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with 0.1 \u00d7 106 YM iRBCs (10 times lower dosage to keep WT mice alive) and isolated splenocytes at day 10 post infection, then we stimulated with crude antigen (P.y YM-iRBC) for T and B cells function analysis. Our results showed that the percentage of splenic IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ cells from Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice were much higher than those from WT mice (Figure 7J). Consistently, IFN-\u03b3 protein amounts in the supernatant of splenocytes after overnight culture with crude antigens and concentrations of malaria-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum were significantly higher in Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT mice (Figures 7K and 7L), suggesting that YM-infected Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212 mice developed much stronger adaptive (B and T cell) immune responses than WT mice.",

STING-deficient mice were more resistant to YM infection than were cGAS-deficient mice, suggesting that other DNA sensors might function in recognizing malarial genomic DNA. For RNA sensing, MDA5, but not RIG-I, is responsible for detecting malaria RNA and triggers MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling. It is known that RIG-I recognizes RNA with a triphosphate (PPP) moiety and 5\u2032 blunt-ended 20 nucleotides, whereas MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA (1\u20132 kb) (Goubau et al., 2013). These structural and length requirements of dsRNA may explain why malaria RNA interacts with MDA5, but not with RIG-I, to trigger downstream MAVS-dependent type I IFN signaling. Although cGAS-STING- and MDA5-MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling is important and operates in all cell types, including macrophages and cDCs, we did not detect YM malaria 18S rRNA or observe IFN-\u03b2 and SOCS1 expression in macrophages and cDCs within the first 18\u201324 hr post infection. Depletion of macrophages or cDCs did not affect the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at 24 hr post infection, further suggesting that macrophages and cDCs are not involved the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the early stage of YM infection.",

Our results clearly demonstrate the requirement for pDCs in the production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 during the first 24 hr of infection, but not after that time. Conversely, depletion of macrophages or cDCs during the first 24 hr of infection affected neither IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production nor parasitemia or host mortality in this YM model. However, depletion of macrophages or cDCs after 24 hr post infection resulted in increased parasitemia and host mortality, suggesting that these cell types participated in anti-malaria immunity, which is consistent with previous results showing that classic DCs are required for inducing T cell response (Voisine et al., 2010). Although B cells and T cells are not required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and parasitemia control during the first 5\u20136 days post infection, they are required for the control of parasitemia and host mortality at later times (>6 days), as suggested by previous studies using cerebral malaria (Ball et al., 2013, Haque et al., 2014).",

YM RNA activates TLR7 and recruits the downstream adaptor MyD88 to trigger IRF7-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway. However, previous studies show that mice deficient with STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7, or IFNAR1 expression are resistant to P. berghei ANKA infection (Haque et al., 2014, Sharma et al., 2011), suggesting that type I IFN impairs host anti-malaria responses to ANKA. To explain why type I IFN plays opposing roles in host immune responses to different malaria strain infection, we examined the timing and amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in response to two lethal Plasmodium strains (P. yoelii YM and P. berghei ANKA) and found that the timing and amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production are different in WT mice in response to YM or ANKA infection: low amount of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 only at day 1 after YM infection versus large amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at day 4 after ANKA infection (Haque et al., 2014). We propose that early robust production or administration of type I IFN (18\u201324 hr post infection) is essential to induce innate and adaptive immunity against malaria. By contrast, late time production of type I IFN (3\u20134 days after ANKA infection) impairs host anti-malaria immune responses. Thus, different malaria strains have evolved to evade host immune system by either inhibiting type I IFN production at the early infection phase (in YM strain) or shifting type I IFN production to the late time (4 days post infection) (in ANKA strain). Similar results have been obtained in LCMV infection or other pathogens (O\u2019Connell et al., 2004, Teles et al., 2013, Wilson et al., 2013). In these cases, persistent production of type I IFN even at day 9 post LCMV infection is observed, which, in turn, induces the expression of negative regulators, such as IL-10 and PD-L1, to inhibit adaptive immune response. Our study showed that robust type I IFN production (only at day 1) produced by pDCs activates cDCs and macrophages to induce adaptive immune response for the clearance of YM infection. Our notion is also supported by a recent study, showing that administration of type I IFN at an early time (6\u201312 hr post-infection) after SARS-CoV infection promotes host innate and adaptive immune response. By contrast, delayed type I IFN production promotes lung immunopathology with diminished survival and impairs anti-viral immunity (Channappanavar et al., 2016). Thus, early robust production of type I IFN (18\u201324 hr post infection) promotes innate and adaptive immune responses, while delayed type I IFN production (3\u20134 days post infection) impairs innate and adaptive immune responses. The timing and amounts of type I IFN production may be dependent upon cell tropism (targeting different cell types during infection) and distinct strain-specific pathogenesis (Gun et al., 2014, Wu et al., 2014). Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for these opposing roles of type I IFN in malaria and viral infection.",

            "text": "Our study identified SOCS1 as a key negative regulator, which interacted with MyD88 and inhibited MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling. A recent study shows a role for STING in negatively regulating inflammatory responses of macrophages in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through upregulation of A20, SOCS1, and SOCS3 (Sharma et al., 2015), but its role in MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling is not known in this disease model. We further showed that inactivation of Ifih1, Tmem173, or Mavs markedly reduced Socs1 expression in vitro and in vivo and increased IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression. Silencing or genetic deletion of Socs1 in YM-infected WT mice markedly reduced parasitemia and host mortality. The predominant role of SOCS1 is to regulate MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs because the observed increase in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression after siRNA-mediated Socs1 silencing disappeared when pDCs were depleted, suggesting that Socs1 silencing mainly affects MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Based on these findings, we propose a working model to illustrate how type I IFN is regulated in response to YM infection (Figure S7C). Activation of cGAS-STING and MDA5-MAVS by YM infection triggers IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling in pDCs, which produce low amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and activate negative regulator SOCS1 in WT pDCs. SOCS1 then inhibits MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, which produces more than 100-fold higher cytokine amounts than those produced by STING- and MAVS-mediated IRF3-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway. By contrast, SOCS1 expression is markedly reduced in Ifih1\n\u2212/\u2212, Mavs\n\u2212/\u2212, and Tmem173\ngt pDCs, allowing the activation of MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling. Thus, lethal YM infection activates two distinct type I IFN signaling pathways in pDCs. YM takes advantage of the cross-inhibition of TLR7-MyD88-mediated type I IFN signaling by cGAS-STING- and MDA5-MAVS-mediated type I IFN through upregulation of Socs1 in WT mice to avoid host innate immune response. Silencing or genetic ablation of genes, such as Socs1 or those in the STING- and MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway, relieves SOCS1-suppressive effects on TLR7-MyD88-mediated type I IFN signaling and permits robust production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the first 24 hr post infection, then activates downstream signaling pathways via IFNAR in other innate immune cells, such as macrophages and cDCs, for priming adaptive immunity mediated by B and T cells to clear YM infection at later times. Thus, our findings not only identify a critical regulatory mechanism between different type I IFN signaling pathways in pDCs, as well as a critical role of stage-dependent type I IFN production and specific contribution of different immune cells for developing protective immunity, but also provide potential therapeutic targets for the development of safe and effective malaria vaccines.",

(F and G) WT chimeric mice were irradiated and transplanted with bone marrow cells of Mavs\u2212/\u2212:Zbtb46-DTR mice, then untreated or treated with DT as indicated at 4 days before or 1 day after YM infection. Serum amounts of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 collected at 24 hr after infection are shown in (F), and daily YM parasitemias and mortality rates are shown in (G). (H and I) WT and Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with YM, followed by i.v. administration of recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at 18 hr post infection. Parasitemias at day 5 and day 7 are shown in (H). Daily YM parasitemias and mortality rates are shown in (I). (J and K) Intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3 were measured by flow cytometry in splenocytes of WT and Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 10 post YM infection, followed by stimulation with crude antigens (YM iRBCs). Statistical analysis is shown in (J). Meanwhile, splenocytes from YM-infected WT and Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice were cultured with crude antigens (iRBCs) overnight, and cell supernatants were collected for ELISA analysis (K). (L) Malaria specific IgG in serum from WT and Mavs\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 10 post YM infection, evaluated by ELISA. Data are representative of three independent experiments and are plotted as the mean \u00b1 SD. \u2217p < 0.05, \u2217\u2217p < 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.001 versus corresponding control. NS, not significant. \u2020 denotes mouse death. See also Figure S7.",
