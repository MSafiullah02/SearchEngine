            "text": "In summary, an infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia, and the majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. We have observed that the use of higher dose ICS was associated with a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture in patients with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. Further studies are needed to investigate why COPD patients on ICS appear more prone to pneumonia as reported by recent studies.4, 26\n",
