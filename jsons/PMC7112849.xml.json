            "text": "Remyelination has been observed in MS plaques (Raine, 1993; Prineas et al., 1993; Bruck et al., 1994) and in animal models of demyelinating disease of viral (Jordan et al., 1989a) or autoimmune etiology (Raine et al., 1984). Molecular correlates of remyelination are of interest as they may be quantitated and could therefore provide an index of myelin repair in lesions. Once CNS myelination is set into motion, a series of genes coding for myelin proteins are coordinately expressed in oligodendrocytes, leading to the wrapping of specialized myelin membrane around axons. During myelination, different transcripts coding for various isoforms of a major myelin protein, myelin basic protein (MBP), are sequentially generated by alternative splicing. Transcripts containing exon 2 and coding for the 21.5 and 17 kDa MBP isoforms emerge postnatally in the mouse and peak before myelin sheaths appear. Exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are then down regulated and alternatively spliced transcripts coding for the mature 14 and 18.5 kDa MBP isoforms are synthesized and mature MBP proteins are incorporated into myelin sheaths (Newman et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989b). In adult mice, during remyelination in a monophasic demyelinating disease induced by a corona virus, the same programmed sequence of events characteristic of developmental myelination occurs. At the site of demyelination exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are upregulated before remyelination. Transcripts coding for mature MBP isoforms are expressed later when myelin is repaired (Jordan et al., 1990). Thus, exon 2 MBP transcript expression may be used as an molecular marker of remyelination. The sequence and timing of expression of such a molecular marker during chronic relapsing demyelination has however not yet been characterized.",

A characteristic signal was observed in white matter using the exon 2 MBP antisense probe, while adjacent sections from the ame cords hybridized with sense probe had no detectable signal (not shown). The same probes were then used to examine spinal cords of mice at various times after adoptive transfer of MBP specific T cells. While a mouse in the preclinical stage did not demonstrate exon 2 specific signal, the majority (11/17, 64%) of mice sacrificed during the peak of the first episode of disease showed exon 2 MBP containing transcripts in lesions of their spinal cords (Fig. 1A\nand B, Table 1). At the peak of the second episode 5/13 (38%) were expressing these transcripts. Therefore a total of 16/30 (53%) were positive for exon 2 signal when assessed at the peak of the first or second episode. In contrast EAE mice sacrificed during the recovery phase of the first episode (days 3 to 7 after the peak of the first episode) did not reveal exon 2 containing MBP transcripts (Table 1). Similarly, when mice were sacrificed or more days after the peak of the second episode, exon 2 positive cells were again generally not detected (Table 1).

In situ hybridization signal was also detected in and around the lesions using antisense probes for MBP exon 1, which detects all MBP transcripts (not shown). To determine whether transcripts encoding the proteolipid protein (PLP) were present in the same lesions as exon 2 MBP containing transcripts, adjacent sections of the lumbar spinal cord were hybridized with each probe (Fig. 1C). Within lesions, both MBP and PLP transcripts were detected as grain clusters (Fig. 2).

We demonstrate here that, in autoimmune mediated relapsing EAE in adult mice, MBP exon 2 transcripts are expressed in the spinal cord of the majority (16/30) of mice at the peak of clinical disease during the first and second episodes of disease. This molecular marker of remyelination was found only in mice examined at the peak of a clinical episode of paralysis and was rare in mice examined during the recovery or stable phase of disease. PLP transcripts also appear to be upregulated in EAE lesions and may be expressed by remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

Activated macrophages or microglia may secrete factors that promote chemotaxis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells which then differentiate and express exon 2 containing MBP and PLP transcripts (Kristensson et al., 1986). Alternatively oligodendrocytes surviving in the lesions may dedifferentiate and express exon 2 MBP containing transcripts as observed in adult human oligodendrocytes regenerating in vitro (Gogate et al., 1994). In addition, MBP exon 2 containing transcripts and proteins have been recently described in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Cappello et al., 1995). Finally, it has been shown that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) enhances remyelination in acute EAE in the rat (Yao et al., 1995). Thus, the detection of exon 2 MBP transcript expression may be a useful molecular marker of remyelination when such therapies are applied to relapsing autoimmune mediated demyelinating disease.",
