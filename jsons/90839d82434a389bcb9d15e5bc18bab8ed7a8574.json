There is no way of controling \u03b3, only \u03b2 depends on the behaviour of the people and is thus amendable to our intervention. In lack of either a vaccine or a cure this is the only amendable parameter. [1] have studied how this can be done. This currently goes by the term flattening the curve. In order to make a valid assessment of actions taken in the past or to make reliable predictions for the future, reliable numbers are needed, but hard to get.
