It is a brilliant citron yellow needle crystal and entirely insoluble in cold water, poorly soluble in hot water, but quite soluble in alcohol and lipids. A quercetin glycoside is formed by attaching a glycosyl group (a sugar such as glucose, rhamnose, or rutinose) as a replacement for one of the OH groups (commonly at position 3). The attached glycosyl group can change the solubility, absorption, and in vivo effects. As a general rule of thumb, the presence of a glycosyl group (quercetin glycoside) results in increased water solubility compared to quercetin aglycone [4,5].",

Quercetin is also found in medicinal botanicals, including Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum, and Sambucus canadensis [6,7,8]. In red onions, higher concentrations of quercetin occur in the outermost rings and in the part closest to the root, the latter being the part of the plant with the highest concentration [9]. One study found that organically grown tomatoes had 79% more quercetin than chemically grown fruit [10]. Quercetin is present in various kinds of honey from different plant sources [11]. Food-based sources of quercetin include vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, beverages and other products of plant origin [12]. In the determined food, the highest concentration is 234 mg/100 g of edible portion in capers (raw), the lowest concentration is 2 mg/100 g of edible portion in black or green tea (Camellia sinensis) [13].",

The estimated flavonoid intake ranges from 50 to 800 mg/day (quercetin accounts for 75%), mostly depending on the consumption of fruits and vegetables and the intake of tea [14]. In the Suihua area of northern China, quercetin intake was reported to be 4.37 mg/day, where the main food sources of flavonol was apples (7.4%), followed by potatoes (3.9%), lettuce (3.8%) and oranges (3.8%) [15], whereas the average quercetin intake was 4.43 mg/day, with apple (3.7%), potato (2.5%), celery (2.2%), eggplant (2.2%), and actinidia (1.6%) being the main food sources of quercetin in Harbin, China [16]. The most recent study showed that quercetin intake is about 18 mg/day for Chinese healthy young males. In the USA, flavonol intake is about 13 mg/day for U.S. adults, while quercetin represents three-quarters of this amount. The mean quercetin intake was approximately 14.90 to 16.39 mg per day. Onions, tea, and apples contained high amounts of quercetin [17]. In Japan, the average and median quercetin intakes were 16.2 and 15.5 mg/day, respectively; the quercetin intake by men was lower than that by women; and the quercetin intakes showed a low correlation with age in both men and women. The estimated quercetin intake was similar during summer and winter. Quercetin was mainly ingested from onions and green tea, both in summer and in winter. Vegetables, such as asparagus, green pepper, tomatoes, and red leaf lettuce, were good sources of quercetin in summer [18]. In Australia, black and green teas were the dominant sources of quercetin. Other sources included onion, broccoli, apple, grape, and beans [19]. Analysis of the 24-h recall data indicated an average adult intake of total flavonoids (>18 years) of 454 mg/day. Apple was the most important source of quercetin until age 16\u201318 years, after which onion became an increasingly important prominent source [19]. In Spain, the average daily intake of quercetin is 18.48 mg/day, which is significantly higher than that in the United States (9.75 mg/day), based on sources like tea, citrus fruits and juice, beers and ales, wines, melon, apples, onions, berries and bananas [20].",

Available evidence indicates that quercetin glucosides (like those found predominantly in onion or shallot flesh) are far better absorbed than its rutinosides (the major quercetin glycoside in tea). The glucosides are efficiently hydrolyzed in the small intestine by beta-glucosidases to the aglycone form, much of which is then absorbed [22]. Quercetin glucuronic acid and its sulfuric acid derivatives were more easily absorbed than quercetin [22]. Thereafter, its absorption is affected by differences in its glycosylation, the food matrix from which it is consumed, and the co-administration of dietary components such as fiber and fat [23]. Thus different sugar types and sugar group conjugation sites will result in absorption variation.",

Kidney is a major organ of excretion. Quercetin concentration in urine increased with the increasing dose and time after intake of fruit juice was ingested in human [36], perhaps benzoic acid derivatives are common metabolite of quercetin [37]. Human subjects can absorb significant amounts of quercetin from food or supplements, and elimination is quite slow, with a reported half-life ranging from 11 to 28 h [38]. The average terminal half-life of quercetin is 3.5 h [39]. The total recovery of C-quercetin in urine, feces and exhaled air is highly variable, depending on the individual [40]. A high amount of absorbed quercetin is extensively metabolized and eventually eliminated by the lungs [41]. Additional literature suggests that isoquercetin (glycosylated quercetin) is more completely absorbed than quercetin in the aglycone form, and that the simultaneous ingestion of quercetin with vitamin C, folate and additional flavonoids improves bioavailability [38,42].",

Moreover, in glial cells it was even shown that quercetin can inhibit LPS-induced mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, this effect of quercetin resulted in a diminished apoptotic neuronal cell death induced by microglial activation [47]. Quercetin inhibits production of inflammation-producing enzymes (cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX)) [48,49]. It limits LPS-induced inflammation via inhibition of Src- and Syk-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)-(p85) tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/PI3K complex formation that limits activation of downstream signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells [50]. It can also inhibit Fc\u03b5RI-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tryptase and histamine from human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells (hCBMCs); this inhibition appears to involve in inhibition of calcium influx, as well as phospho-protein kinase C (PKC) [51]. The study of quercetin against H2O2-induced inflammation showed the protective effects of quercetin against inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and indicated that the effect was mediated via the downregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and CD80 expression [52].",

            "text": "In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 1002 subjects took 500 or 1000 mg/day quercetin or a placebo for 12 weeks. For the group as a whole, quercetin supplementation had no significant influence on rates of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) compared to placebo. In a subgroup of subjects age 40 or older who self-rated themselves as physically fit, 1000 mg/day quercetin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in total sick days and symptom severity associated with URTI [72]. Female subjects were supplemented with 500 or 1000 mg/day quercetin or placebo for 12 weeks. While quercetin supplementation significantly increased plasma quercetin levels, it had no influence on measure of immune function [73]. Quercetin (100 mg/day) did not alter exercise-induced changes in several measures of immune function following three days of intense exercise in trained athletes, but it significantly reduced URTI incidence (1 of 20 subjects in active versus 9 of 20 in placebo group) during the two-week post-exercise period [74]. A similar lack of effect on strenuous exercise-induced immune system perturbation was found in subjects who took 1000 mg/day of quercetin for three weeks before, during, and continuing for two weeks after the 160-km Western States Endurance Run. In this study, however, there were no differences in the post-race illness rates between quercetin and placebo groups [75].",

Nieman et al. determined the influence of two weeks of 1000 mg/day quercetin compared with placebo supplementation on exercise performance and skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in untrained, young adult males. It resulted in significantly reduced post-exercise measures for both inflammation and oxidative stress, with a chronic augmentation of granulocyte oxidative burst activity [77].
