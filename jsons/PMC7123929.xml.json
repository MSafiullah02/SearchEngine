More recently, it has been defined as \u2018a core public health function that ensures the right information is available at the right time and in the right place to inform public health decisions and actions\u2019 (DH PHE Transition Team 2012). Surveillance systems are often thought of as information loops involving healthcare providers, public health agencies and the public. The cycle begins when cases of disease are reported by healthcare professionals to the public health agencies.",

Public health surveillance can also identify changes in the distribution of risk factors and can indicate if certain sectors of the population are at increased risk as a result of environmental, behavioural or other risk factors (Hawker et al. 2012). Consequently, surveillance data can provide an overview of a population\u2019s health status as well as the determinants of health (DH PHE Transition Team 2012).

In order to be effective, surveillance systems needs to be efficient and practical. When setting up a surveillance programme, it is important to consider exactly what information is required to avoid collecting data that will not be used, wasting both time and resources. A key purpose of communicable disease surveillance is to detect the occurrence of outbreaks or epidemics so immediate action can be taken to identify and control the source (e.g. outbreaks of food poisoning) or to enable health services to quickly implement emergency plans to deal with an increased number of patients (e.g. during an influenza epidemic). Therefore, it is essential that data are collected quickly and efficiently, providing timely information for action (Table 1). Most data are now collected electronically and automatically imported into databases, resulting in improved data quality and timeliness (Buchler 2012; Thacker et al. 2012). However, it is important to be aware that delays can occur at any point of a surveillance system, for example, physicians cannot diagnose some diseases until confirmatory laboratory testing has been completed.\n",

Usually, in countries like the UK or the USA, there will be a 2\u20133-month period during the winter when the level of clinical influenza activity rises above the baseline threshold. As well as using data from laboratory confirmed cases of influenza, reports of patients visiting their GP with influenza-like illness (ILI) can be used to identify increasing rates of infection (Fig. 1). When influenza activity rises above the baseline rate, specific public health responses, such as the prescription of antiviral prophylaxis, will be triggered by pre-defined public health policies. As seen in this example, surveillance outputs should feed directly into an operational response in real time to minimise any delay in response (DH PHE Transition Team 2012).\n",

To do this, it is essential to have a good understanding of what the surveillance system can and cannot realistically deliver. It is also important to consider timeliness of reporting and representativeness (Noah 2006). Surveillance data generally only represent the tip of the iceberg (Fig. 4). However, the proportion of cases reported is likely to depend on factors such as the severity and duration of disease. For example, most cases of meningococcal meningitis will require treatment and are likely to be reported, while only a small proportion of patients with a foodborne illness will seek healthcare (Somerville et al. 2012). However, trends in the proportion of cases that are reported for different conditions generally remain relatively constant over time. When interpreting changes in rates over time, it is important to consider whether any factors have changed within the system, for example, changes in diagnostic testing protocols or an increase in media publicity, etc. which may distort the results.\n",

The calculation of rates takes into account denominators (or the comparative size of different populations) and therefore is useful when comparing the number of cases in different sized groups or populations. However, this type of graph provides very little useful data for policy makers or public health practitioners since it gives no indication of whether these rates vary in different areas of the country or in different groups of the population. To address these issues, the tuberculosis surveillance programme in the UK is an \u2018enhanced surveillance programme\u2019 which collects information on variables such as country of birth and ethnicity, in addition to routine demographic information such as age and sex. This information can be used to help develop policies focusing on improving the health of vulnerable groups. For example, Fig. 5b shows the rates of tuberculosis in two groups of the population: those born in the UK and those born elsewhere (non-UK born). It clearly shows that the rates of infection are over 20 times higher in the non-UK born population than in UK born. If we had simply presented the number of cases the size of this disparity would not have been seen as the size of the non-UK born population is much smaller.\n",

Since surveillance reports are used by a wide variety of professionals such as policy makers, public health specialists as well as the media and general public, reports should include straightforward tables and figures plus an explanatory commentary. The frequency of reporting will be determined by the potential impact of the disease on public health. Monthly or quarterly reporting may be appropriate for diseases where rates are changing relatively slowly. For example, rates of healthcare associated infections are reported monthly in the UK while vaccine coverage rates are reported quarterly. In some situations, more frequent reports are needed. For example during the winter, organisations such as PHE and CDC provide weekly summaries of the number of cases of influenza and other seasonal respiratory illnesses. If the number of cases is changing rapidly, such as during an influenza epidemic or pandemic, reports may be published daily; however, this is very resource intensive.
