As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued case definitions for the diagnosis of probable and suspected cases of SARS.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n Due to the lack of data on the disease, these definitions were rather non\u2010specific and included anyone who had a febrile respiratory illness since November 1, 2002 with radiographic infiltrates consistent with a pneumonia, had been in close contact with a SARS patient or had a history of travel to an affected area or residence in an affected area, during the 10 days prior to the onset of illness.\n3\n The aetiological agent of SARS was initially believed to be the human metapneumovirus, the coronavirus, or both, although it is now increasingly evident from molecular and serologic assays, virus isolation techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that a novel coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) is the causative agent.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n\n",

Viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs and stool of patients can be detected using a reverse transcriptase (RT\u2010PCR) assay but is only positive in approximately 50\u201360% of cases.\n4\n, \n8\n As a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is currently unavailable, the diagnosis of SARS remains a clinical one that depends largely on radiographic evidence of pneumonia, at least in the initial stage of the infection.\n3\n Therefore, radiological assessment of SARS plays an important role in the management of SARS.\n1\n, \n2\n\n,\n\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n",

A minority of patients demonstrated one of two patterns: pattern 3, where there was minimal radiographic progression throughout the illness prior to resolution in 10 (7%) patients, and pattern 4, where there was relentless progression of radiographic opacities culminating in death in 6 of 7 (4%) patients at the time of publication.\n14\n In a separate review of 40 patients with probable SARS, consolidation largely followed two patterns of serial radiographic change that reflected the clinical outcome, whereby the consolidation either improved rapidly or, in the majority of patients (72%), progressed to bilateral extensive pneumonia.\n16\n\n",
