Moreover, the use of small volumes of reagents and antibodies is also a\ncharacteristic of protein microarrays, which made it economical and useful for those\nconditions when large quantities of samples were not easy to get. It is well known that wild\nwaterfowl and shorebirds play an important role in disseminating AIV among different regions\n[15, 18].
