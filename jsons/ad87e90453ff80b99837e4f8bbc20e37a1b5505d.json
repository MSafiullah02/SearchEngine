This suggests that MUO is an immune-mediated disease. However, a study targeting the inflammatory components of GME found a predominance of MHC Class II and CD3 + T cells, which might be the result of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. 10 Therefore, whether the immune response is targeting an infection is a critical open question that this study sought to answer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Currently, the etiology of MUO remains unknown. Studies searching for an infectious etiology have failed to reveal a consistent infectious agent. 9, [11] [12] [13] Prior studies have utilized polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, culture, immunohistochemistry, or a combination of these tests to investigate viruses commonly implicated in CNS disease, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, canine parainfluenza virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, bunyaviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, and parechoviruses. [12] [13] [14] Although the overwhelming majority of these studies have been negative or inconclusive, they have been limited by targeted testing for specific agents as opposed to utilizing less biased methodology to search for pathogens. This limitation has impacted our understanding of human neurologic disease as well: in large analyses of human encephalitis cases, targeted methods failed to detect an infectious agent in up to 70% of suspected cases. [15] [16] [17] In this study, we utilized a pathogen discovery technique that bypasses many of the limitations of specific diagnostics: next-generation metagenomic sequencing. This technology has emerged in human and veterinary medicine as an invaluable tool for pathogen discovery in neurologic and other diseases of unknown etiology. [18] [19] [20] [21] In metagenomic sequencing, total nucleic acids from a clinical or environmental sample are randomly sequenced and are taxonomically categorized by comparison to known sequences in public databases. In this study, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain, or both of 22 dogs with or without MUO were sampled by antemortem and postmortem techniques. In previous investigations of MUO in dogs, only brain samples were tested for infectious agents; however, CSF is a common sample utilized in the clinical evaluation of neurologic disease for the detection of infectious agent nucleic acids, especially by PCR. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] CSF is more readily available as an antemortem sample and therefore more clinically relevant for the antemortem diagnosis of MUO. Additionally, CSF has been successfully utilized in previous metagenomics sequencing studies to detect infectious organisms in encephalitis. 18 Therefore, based on sample availability and clinical relevance, this study utilized CSF and brain to attempt to identify a candidate etiologic agent of MUO.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 148, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 571, "end": 575, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1368, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1373, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1981, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1986, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1991, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 1996, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2001, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2006, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To be included in the diseased group for this study, dogs had to be greater than six months of age with a neurologic examination consistent with focal or multifocal neurological dysfunction.

MUO, like many other neurologic diseases, can be focally or multifocally distributed. This limitation is likely to apply more to biopsy/postmortem samples than to pathogen detection in CSF. However, low or inconsistent shedding of organisms into the CSF could reduce the likelihood of detection. Future studies could benefit from more consistent use of antemortem image-guided biopsies (only 1 of 11 of our MUO cases) and sampling of multiple sections of the CNS postmortem (only 4 of 11 MUO cases), as well as multiple time-separated CSF sample collections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Furthermore, although four of the diseased cases were histologically confirmed as having inflammatory brain disease, seven cases were presumptively diagnosed with MUO. Strict inclusion criteria were used for antemortem diagnosis in this study. However, the lack of histopathology does not definitively rule out other disease processes, such as lymphoma. Therefore, it is possible that not all of the presumptively diagnosed MUO cases were GME, NME or NLE. Additionally, only two of the four cases evaluated by histopathology yielded a definitive diagnosis of GME or NME, whereas the other two were diagnosed as meningoencephalitis of undetermined subtype. The use of a greater number of cases with histologic confirmation could have strengthened the diagnostic certainty of each case and allowed for a more specific investigation of MUO based on histologic type.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are also several possible technical reasons that could have prevented us from identifying an infectious agent underlying MUO. First, it might be that we lacked the necessary sensitivity. Although metagenomic sequencing can detect any pathogen, it is generally less sensitive than targeted methods such as PCR. The sensitivity of PCR is typically defined in absolute units (eg 100 genome copies in a quantitative PCR reaction), but the sensitivity of metagenomic sequencing is limited by read depth and the relative pathogen concentration. For example, if a metagenomic dataset contains 1 million unique sequences and if a pathogen's nucleic acid is present at a concentration lower than 1 part per million host nucleic acid molecules, then it is unlikely to be detected. The development and use of methods to deplete mammalian nucleic acids could have improved the sensitivity of our study by eliminating dog sequences and enriching for microorganismal nucleic acids. Our analysis of bird brain samples with high and low WNV copy numbers illustrates this sensitivity threshold. We detected WNV by sequencing in the crow brain, which had 8.82 9 10 4 viral RNA copies per microliter of RNA but did not detect WNV in the robin brain, which had 1.68 9 10 2 genome copies per microliter of RNA. It can, therefore, be deduced that our limit of detection lies somewhere between these values. This range is large, and the use of WNV-positive samples with intermediate copy numbers could have allowed us to narrow this empirically determined limit of detection. Additionally, CSF has inherently low nucleic acid content because of the low number of nucleated cells present when compared to tissue. Therefore, DNA and RNA extraction generally have a low yield and further amplification is required for library preparation in these samples. Amplification can introduce base-composition bias and increases the number of nonunique reads, contributing to reduced sequencing quality and read depth. Finally, it is also possible that the cause of MUO is an infectious agent so divergent from known pathogens that its sequence was unrecognizable. This is not likely, however. Eukaryotic and bacterial pathogens typically have characteristic conserved sequences that are easily recognizable (eg ribosomal RNA sequences), and viruses can typically be recognized by viral polymerase sequences, especially when compared at the protein level, as we did.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, we applied the best available molecular methods to continue the search for an MUO etiology, and did not find a candidate agent. There are several technical and biological reasons that could have prevented us from doing so. However, the thoroughness of our approach, our inclusion of internal positive controls, similar negative results from previous studies, and the clinical responsiveness to immunosuppressant therapy all
