The specimen will be isolated from the location of infection for viruses that establish localized infections (Table 7.1\n). For instance, influenza virus is readily detected from nasopharyngeal swabs, and herpes simplex viruses can be isolated from the oral or genital lesions that these viruses cause (Table 7.2\n). Viruses that establish systemic infection may be isolated from several different sources, depending upon the virus. The site of pathology is often a good place to start, although the virus may be present in the blood as well. For example, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infect hepatocytes (liver cells) but are detectable in serum.",

A person\u2019s viral load is highest during acute infection but may drop to undetectable levels as the infection is cleared. On the other hand, it takes weeks for antibodies to develop during the primary response against a virus (Fig. 7.1\n). As described in Chapter 6, \u201cThe Immune Response to Viruses,\u201d IgM is the antibody isotype that is first produced by plasma cells against a pathogen, but the higher-affinity IgG isotype begins being secreted by plasma cells later during infection and during secondary responses. Therefore, the choice of diagnostic test will depend upon the patient\u2019s stage of infection. Tests for the virus itself are best performed before or while symptoms are present. The levels of IgM versus IgG antibodies against a virus can be used to help determine if the infection recently occurred, but neither of these will be present at the beginning of a primary infection.",

Blood is collected into appropriate tubes, depending upon whether cells, serum, or plasma is required for the diagnostic test. Tubes containing sodium heparin or EDTA as an anticoagulant block the clotting of blood and are used to obtain white blood cells (leukocytes) or plasma, the liquid fraction that remains when blood is centrifuged to pellet blood cells. Serum is obtained by allowing blood to clot and then centrifuging the clot, leaving behind the liquid portion of the blood (Fig. 7.2\n). The difference between plasma and serum, therefore, is that plasma contains clotting factors that are part of the clot when serum is obtained. Antibodies and virus/virus antigen will be found in serum and plasma, although virus could also be found in the leukocytes, if they are a target of the virus. For collecting fluid from skin lesions, a sterile swab is used to collect the fluid and cells from a lesion that has been opened, and then the swab is placed in a special transport medium. The same transport medium is used for nasopharyngeal swabs, cervical swabs, rectal swabs, or throat swabs. Stool is collected into a clean, leak-proof container.\n",

Although nucleic acids may be able to be recovered from these samples, infectious virus will not be present. To prevent virus inactivation, samples other than blood that must be transported to diagnostic laboratories are refrigerated during shipment, or frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice if the transport will take 3 days or more. However, some viruses are not stable when frozen, including varicella zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, measles, and human cytomegalovirus. These viruses must be frozen in a special transport medium to prevent their inactivation. Much emphasis is placed upon the efficacy of the diagnostic test itself, but no assay can provide meaningful results if the specimen has not been collected, stored, and transported with care.",

The cells are housed in plastic flasks or bottles and bathed in a liquid growth medium that contains nutrients and supplements (Fig. 7.3A\n). These cultures are grown in an incubator set to body temperature (37\u00b0C). A cell line is a set of cells that have been isolated from a tissue or organ fragment (Fig. 7.3B and C). Cell lines can be finite or continuous. Finite cell lines will only undergo mitosis a limited number of times, while continuous cell lines are immortal and will proliferate indefinitely. This characteristic is usually a result of genetic mutations. Cell lines derived from tumors, which have lost control of regulating the cell cycle and proliferate indefinitely, can also result in continuous cell lines. The choice of a finite versus continuous cell line for propagating viruses in culture will depend upon the virus that is needed to be isolated. Additionally, the cell line must be one that expresses the cell surface receptor specific for the virus and be permissive to infection; otherwise, the virus will not be able to attach and replicate within the cell line.",

            "text": "Cell cultures must be grown using aseptic technique and sterile conditions, otherwise bacteria and fungi that get into the cell culture will grow profusely in the rich growth medium and contaminate the culture. A sterile environment is provided by a biological safety cabinet (BSC), which is different from a fume hood that is used when working with chemicals. A BSC uses a fan to filter air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which filter out bacteria, fungi, spores, and viruses to generate sterile air. Particles of 0.3 \u03bcM in size are the most penetrating through the filters but are still removed with 99.97% efficiency. There are three different classes of BSCs, designated class I, class II, and class III, that provide varying levels of protection to the worker and to the biological material being manipulated. Class I BSCs act much like chemical fume hoods, except that the air is filtered through a HEPA filter before it is released to the environment. The worker and environment are protected, but the biological material is exposed to nonsterile air from the environment so these are not used for cell culture (Fig. 7.4A\n). Class II BSCs are most often used, as they afford protection to the worker, the biological material, and the environment. The air entering the BSC from the front is sucked into a grille to prevent it from contaminating the working surface, which is constantly bathed in HEPA-filtered air to ensure a sterile working environment (Fig. 7.4B and D). Class II BSCs rely on the laminar flow of air, which means that the BSC creates an uninterrupted flow of air in a consistent, uninterrupted stream. As long as the work is performed within the stream of air, then the material will remain sterile. The air is also sent through a HEPA filter before being released to the environment. Class II BSCs are sufficient to work with cells and the majority of viruses. Some dangerous pathogens must be manipulated within a class III BSC, which is air-tight to prevent any exposure of the virus to the worker, who must use the heavy-duty rubber gloves that are built into the BSC to work with the pathogen (Fig. 7.4C). The air leaving a class III BSC is passed through two HEPA filters, or a single HEPA filter and incinerator, to ensure the pathogen does not enter the environment.",

            "text": "Appropriate levels of safety must be taken when working with viruses. Rhinoviruses cause colds, and so the effects of accidentally being exposed to rhinovirus are minimal and self-limiting. Other viruses, such as viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers, can lead to deadly effects if someone is exposed. Therefore, there exist four biosafety levels (BSLs) that specify what precautions must be taken with different pathogens (Table 7.3\n). Some notable differences between the BSL levels are summarized below:\nBiosafety level 1 (BSL1) is for work involving well-characterized agents not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans. These pathogens present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. All material must be handled in an appropriate way and decontaminated after use, and workers must use gloves for protection, along with a lab coat and safety glasses, if warranted. Work with BSL1 agents does not require a BSC, unless cell cultures require the use of one to maintain sterility.\nBiosafety level 2 (BSL2) is for work with agents that are known to pose moderate hazards to personnel and/or the environment. It includes all the precautions of BSL1 but also requires that laboratory personnel are supervised, receive specific training in handling the pathogenic agents, and conduct any work that may generate infectious aerosols or splashes in a BSC.\nBiosafety level 3 (BSL3) is for work that could cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation. BSL3 work includes all the precautions of BSL2 but also requires a special BSL3-level laboratory that is entered through two self-closing doors and is under negative pressure so that contaminated air is drawn to another area and HEPA-filtered before leaving the room. Laboratory personnel must wear additional protective laboratory clothing, such as a gown, scrub suit, or coveralls, that is only worn while in the laboratory and then decontaminated or disposed of upon exit of the lab. Work must be performed in class II or class III BSCs, depending upon the virus.\nBiosafety level 4 (BSL4) is for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease that is frequently fatal and for which no vaccines or treatments are available. In addition to BSL3 standards, personnel must change out of their normal clothing and into laboratory clothing in a specific entry room. Some BSL4 labs use BSL3-protective laboratory clothing but class III BSCs are required for manipulating any infectious materials, which must be decontaminated when passing out of the BSC. Other BSL4 labs require the use of a one-piece protective plastic suit with a separate air supply to keep the suit under positive pressure, which would push out air if any cuts or tears were to occur (Fig. 7.5\n). This suit is decontaminated with a bleach shower upon leaving the lab. In either BSL4 lab scenario, workers must leave through a separate exit room, decontaminate their laboratory clothes, and shower before changing into street clothes. BSL4 labs must be in a separate building or clearly demarcated isolated zone within a building, have emergency power, be sealed from the environment, and provide multiple means of decontaminating the workspace and all infectious materials. These labs are reserved for the most dangerous infectious agents.\n",

Generally, three to six cell lines are selected based upon the test being performed and cell cultures are inoculated with the clinical specimen. Although viruses cannot be seen under the light microscope, they biochemically affect the cells in which they are replicating, which sometimes leads to visible cytopathic effects (CPEs) that are distinguishable using a light microscope (Fig. 7.6A and B\n). For example, some viruses may cause cells that normally attach to the bottom of their culture vessel to round up and detach. Large bubblelike vacuoles are sometimes observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells, which may also swell or shrink, depending upon the virus. Other viruses cause adjacent cell membranes to fuse together, creating a syncytium, or giant multinucleated cell, that can have up to 100 nuclei within the cell. Some viruses cause lysis of the cells in which they replicate. Other viruses cause cell death or damage by hijacking the cell\u2019s transcription and translation machinery, leaving the cell at a deficit to translate its own proteins, including enzymes that are required for metabolic pathways.",

Other times, cell culture is used in conjunction with other assays. Electron microscopy can be used to identify the morphology of the virus, while immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), described in more detail below, can be used to definitely identify a specific virus within cells by recognizing viral antigens.

The related Papanicolaou (pap) smear scrapes cells from the cervix but instead smears them across a slide that is then sent for analysis. A Tzanck smear uses a similar idea but is used to smear cells from skin lesions onto a slide for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections. These specimens would be subject to cytology. On the other hand, tissues are collected when a biopsy is taken. The tissue is sectioned into thin slices and undergoes histological examination at the diagnostic lab.",

Due to the advents of biotechnology, antibodies can be produced in large amounts and are commercially available. These antibodies recognize different antigens from a wide range of pathogens, including viruses. Several widely used and relatively fast assays make use of antibodies to identify the cause of a viral infection. \u201cImmuno\u201d is usually found in the name of the assay to indicate that it uses antibodies, which are produced by plasma cells of the immune system.",

The cells can be from patient specimens or they can be cell cultures that have been infected with patient samples. IFAs use antibodies that are conjugated to fluorophores, or fluorescent dyes, that give off a certain color when they are excited by a particular wavelength of light. The best-known fluorescent dye is fluorescein isothiocyanate, better known as FITC, which is excited by light of 490 nm (blue) and gives off light in the 519 nm range (green). In an IFA, FITC-conjugated antibodies specific for a certain virus are added in a liquid buffer onto the cells or tissue on the slide (Fig. 7.7A\n). If the viral antigen that is recognized by the antibody is present on the cell surface, perhaps because the virus was assembling at the plasma membrane or was in the process of infecting cells when the section was fixed, then the antibodies will bind to the viral antigen present. Alternatively, the cells can be permeabilized with a detergent to allow the antibodies to enter inside the plasma membrane and bind viral antigens there (Fig. 7.7B). In either case, the antibodies will not bind if the specific antigen is not present. After a sufficient period of time to allow binding of the FITC-labeled antibodies, the slides are washed with a buffer. Any antibody that is bound will remain bound, whereas unbound antibody will be rinsed off. The slides are examined under a fluorescence microscope, which contains a special lightbulb that can provide the wavelengths of light able to excite the fluorophores and filters that allow the viewer to see one emitted color at a time. In this case, if any green cells are seen, then the antibodies bound and the virus was present.",

This is a way to get around not having a conjugated primary antibody. It can also be used to amplify a weak signal when not much viral antigen is present. Because this assay requires a secondary antibody and the fluorochrome is not attached to the primary antibody, it is known as an indirect IFA. IFA is used for the identification of a variety of viruses, including several different herpesviruses, influenza, measles, mumps, and adenovirus (Fig. 7.7D).",

The tube is placed in a thermocycler, a bench-top machine that simply changes the temperature of the tube, as its name suggests. In the denaturation stage of PCR, the thermocycler heats the DNA, usually to 95\u00b0C, which breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together and so they separate from each other. In the annealing stage, the temperature is reduced to allow the binding (annealing) of two primers to the separated DNA. The primers are complementary to the sequence to which they bind, and they flank the region to be amplified, one primer on each strand. The annealing temperature is determined by the composition of the nucleotides in the primers, but is usually around 55\u00b0C.",

The diagnostic techniques described in this chapter identify the presence of a virus in a sample, or even the amount of viral nucleic acid, but these assays cannot determine the amount of virus present that is capable of productively infecting cells. A very common virology technique to determine this is known as the plaque assay, which measures the number of virions in a sample that are able to initiate infection of target cells.Microbiologists measure viable bacteria by determining the number of individual bacterial cells in a sample, each of which will form a distinct bacterial colony. This results in the number of colony-forming units, or CFUs, in a sample. Plaque assays measure the number of individual cells that were infected by a single virion, each of which forms a plaque, or clearing, as the virus spreads among neighboring cells. This results in the number of plaque-forming units (PFUs) in a sample, the indication of viral infectivity.To perform a plaque assay, the first step is to use cell culture to plate cells into several cell culture dishes or a multiwell plate\u20146-well or 24-well plates are often used for this purpose\u2014in a liquid medium to support their growth (Fig. 7.13\n). The cell line used must be permissive to infection with the virus that is being studied. The cells are allowed to grow to near confluency, meaning that they have grown to completely cover the bottom of the cell culture vessel. At this point, the medium is removed from the wells. Tenfold serial dilutions of the initial sample are made, in case the initial sample has too much infectious virus and ends up harming the entire well of cells, and 0.1 mL of the experimental samples are added to individual wells. The plate of cells is gently shaken on a flat surface, moving the plate in the motion of a \u201cplus\u201d sign, to ensure that the virus that was just added is equally distributed over all the cells.The virus is given time to bind and enter the cells (<1 h), at which point the cells are covered with a layer of cooled agarose that has been mixed with medium. Having entered random cells in the well, the virus will replicate over the course of the following days, and the agarose ensures that released virions are only able to infect cells immediately adjacent to the infected cell.As the virus replicates and infects more cells, it begins forming plaques, or clearings, that are caused by the cytopathic effects upon the cluster of infected cells. In some cases, the virus is lysing infected cells, and in other cases, the virus has interfered with enough cellular processes to cause damage or death to the infected cells. Eukaryotic viruses typically take 3\u20135 days to form plaques that are large enough to see. Because cells are clear, a dye is used to stain the living cells, which leaves the clear plaques visible when the well is inspected.The number of plaques are counted, giving the number of PFU per well. However, this needs to be converted into PFU/mL in the original sample, so the number of plaques must be divided by the dilution of the sample and by 0.1 mL, since that was the amount added to the cells. Therefore, 0.1 mL of a 0.001 dilution (1/1000) that resulted in 54 plaques means that the starting sample had 540,000 PFU/mL in the initial sample\u201454/0.1 mL/0.001 = 540,000. It is best to write this using scientific notation: the amount of infectious virus in the starting sample was 5.4 \u00d7 105\n PFU/mL.the 3\u2032-end of the primer using the available nucleotides, creating a double-stranded piece of DNA from the single-stranded template. In this way, one double-stranded piece of DNA was separated and replicated to create two copies.",

A fluorescent band, therefore, indicates that DNA is present and was amplified by the PCR reaction.

A modification of PCR that is ubiquitously used is known as real-time PCR, so named because the user can monitor the amplicon amplification in real time using a special thermocycler. A great advantage of monitoring the reaction as it proceeds is that the rate of amplification can be noted. Traditional PCR machines analyze the product after the completion of all cycles, which makes it impossible to know if the reaction had plateaued at an earlier cycle because of limitations in reagents, such as nucleotides. Real-time PCR machines address this concern by providing a visual graph of the amplification. An advantage of being able to see the amplification in real time is that the quantity of the PCR product can be used to back calculate the amount of starting template nucleic acid that was present, since we know that each cycle doubles the amount of DNA. For this reason, real-time PCR is also known as quantitative PCR. Therefore, the standard abbreviation for real-time PCR, is qPCR. (Recall that RT-PCR stands for reverse transcriptase PCR, not real-time PCR!) RT-PCR can also be performed using qPCR; this technique is known as RT-qPCR.",

In the first method, a fluorescent dye is used that intercalates into double-stranded DNA, in the same way that ethidium bromide does. An example of a fluorescent DNA-binding dye is SYBR Green, which is excited with light of 488 nm and emits light at 522 nm (green). The real-time thermocycler is able to provide the excitation wavelength and has detectors to measure the emitted wavelength. Another method involves fluorescent reporter probes, such as Taq-Man\u00ae probes (Fig. 7.15A\n). Like a primer, the probe recognizes a sequence of the DNA target, but it is located in the middle of the amplified sequence, in between the primers. Attached to the probe are a fluorescent reporter dye at one end and a quencher at the other. As long as the reporter dye and quencher are attached to the probe, the quencher absorbs the fluorescence emitted by the excited reporter dye (through the process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or FRET). Taq polymerase breaks down the nucleotides of the probe as it amplifies the DNA to which the probe is bound, releasing the reporter dye and quencher from the probe. When this occurs, the two are physically separated and the quencher molecule can no longer inhibit the reporter\u2019s fluorescence. As with the fluorescent double-stranded DNA dyes, reporter dyes are excited and detected by the thermocycler.",

Real-time PCR works on the same principles as PCR, except that it measures the fluorescence of a reporter dye in real time to monitor the amplification reaction. DNA-binding dyes are used, as are probes attached to a reporter dye and quencher molecule (A). The probe hybridizes to a section of the target DNA in between the two primers. As long as the reporter and quencher are physically close, the quencher absorbs any fluorescence and none is given off. As the primer is extended by DNA polymerase, the probe is broken down, releasing the reporter dye and quencher. Free from the quencher, the reporter dye fluoresces. The fluorescence increases as each cycle is repeated. (B) A real-time PCR amplification plot showing the amplification of eight different concentrations of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) DNA. The number of reaction cycles is on the X axis, while the fluorescence generated in the reactions is on the Y axis. A few important things to note: The samples that start with more DNA are amplified more quickly (require fewer cycles to reach a set threshold, T). Also, each of the cycles eventually plateaus around the same fluorescence, even though we know some samples contain more DNA than others. This is why the samples are compared at the threshold limit (green line).
