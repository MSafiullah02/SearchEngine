If a study considered these as separate outcomes, we used death as the endpoint. Subgroup analyses divided by severity of disease were performed for these two types of outcomes. Definitions of severity of SARS used SARS guidelines of the Ministry of Public Health of China with a blood arterial oxygenation index < 300 mm Hg [15]. Severity of COVID-19 was based on American Thoracic Society guidelines [19]. We used mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for the continuous outcome including days to SARS-CoV-2 clearing, duration of hospitalization. Funnel plots were used to screen for potential publication bias. Statistical analyses used Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). Some studies [2, 11, 14, 15] identified subjects with nonsevere infection which we analyzed separately.",

Because most of the data come from observational databases and because corticosteroids are more likely to be given to persons with severe infections there is selection bias and our conclusions should be viewed cautiously. Also, because 6 of the 11 studies are from subjects with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV our conclusions may not apply to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
