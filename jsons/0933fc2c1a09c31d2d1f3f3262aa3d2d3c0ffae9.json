This descriptive study was performed with Ondokuz May\u0131s University Medical Faculty students on 24-27 March, 2020. The Medical Faculty currently has 2051 students. A questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. For that purpose, the authors designed a questionnaire specifically for this research via the \"Google Forms\" web. This consisted of 40 open-and close-ended questions. The questionnaire was completed by 1375 (67.1%) students. Accordingly, 52.4% of medical students reported feeling mentally unwell. Although 50.8% of medical students reported generally/usually obtaining information about COVID-19 through the social media, 82.0% did not trust information/messages arriving through the social media and WhatsApp. We found that 86.7% of students regarded frequent hand washing as the most important means of protection against COVID-19, and 19.3% of students did not regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe public health problem for Turkey at that moment. In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey. Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students can be excellent activists on these subjects in countries in which medical education is suspended. Measures therefore need to be taken concerning the transmission of up to date and accurate information to medical students.",

The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious threat to public health both globally and in Turkey in recent years. The pandemic is having a major impact on communities and health workers. Health workers are exposed to particular stress due to their intense work tempo, uncertainties over the epidemiology and treatment of the disease, fear, and the application of very strict infection control protocols. Medical students are also living through extraordinary times. Their education was interrupted, and they began experiencing an intense fear caused by uncertainty. While this was happening, they returned to their families and were obliged to evaluate information from very different sources and share this with those with whom they were in contact. This study found that more than half of medical students felt mentally unwell. Such pandemics are generally accompanied by a state of panic, particular when much is unknown concerning the disease. Studies of medical students during different corona virus outbreaks have determined high levels of anxiety [7] [8] [9] . The present study is compatible with the previous literature. Programs aimed at strengthening the mental states of health workers therefore need to be established during pandemics. The results of this study were notified to the Medical Faculty Psychiatry Department, and it was decided that 'COVID-19 and Mental Health' presentations should be included in students' distance education programs.",
