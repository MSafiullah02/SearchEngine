Demographic data included age, gender, and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease and malignancy. Clinical data recorded included vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation. In addition to fever, cough and dyspnea, other clinical characteristics recorded included sputum production, diarrhea (three or more loose or liquid stools per day), bloody stool (stool positive for occult blood test or white blood cell test), myalgia/muscle fatigue/weakness and haemoptysis. The hospital course was reviewed for severity of disease as determined using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia 1 , that is, COVID-19 patients with either one major criterion or three minor criteria were defined as severe COVID-19, while others with mild symptoms defined as non-severe COVID-19. Major criteria include: (1) septic shock with need for vasopressors, and (2) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Minor criteria include: (1) respiratory rate>30 breaths/min, (2) PaO2/FIO2 ratio<250, (3) multilobar infiltrates, (4) confusion/disorientation, (5) uremia (blood urea nitrogen level>20 mg/dl), (6) leukopenia (white blood cell count, 4,000 cells/ml), (7) thrombocytopenia (platelet count,100,000/ml), (8) hypothermia (core temperature, 36\u00baC), and (9) hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation. The need for supplemental oxygen and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were recorded. Treatment of the infection followed the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Patients were routinely given antibiotics, usually Moxifloxacin, and antivirus drugs, usually Lopinavir and Ritonavir.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Patients"}, {"text": "For numerical data, significance of the differences between two study groups were tested by Student t test or Mann-Whitney test, when appropriate. Fisher's exact tests were performed for comparisons of categorical data. Student t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and Fisher's exact tests were conducted with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze associations independent of important risk factors with \"survival\" package in R (version 3.6.1). Models were conditioned on diarrhea and were adjusted for multiple additional potential confounders (sex, age, comorbidities). Likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and Score (logrank) test were used for evaluation of the significance. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression (to avoid a substantial reduction in sample size after stratification).

Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same species of virus and share the same ACE2 receptor, our observation predicts similar tissue tropisms and clinical manifestations for both viruses. Although mainly a lower respiratory tract disease 3 , gastrointestinal manifestation of SARS-CoV infection including watery diarrhea were commonly observed [4] [5] [6] . Those studies reported that 26-53% of their SARS patients had diarrhea during the course of illness. SARS-CoV infection also caused symptoms in other organs such as heart, kidney, liver, and adrenal glands 3 . The cell tropism of the SARS-CoV correlates with the cellular distribution of ACE2 expression 7 . This correlation was also observed with SARS-CoV infected patients 8 . In our study, the pulmonary and intestinal manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were found to be comparable to those of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, one patient presented with impaired liver function, one myocarditis, and another patient presented compromised kidney function. In line with our clinical observations and the tissue distribution of ACE2, hepatic injury was observed in the first US COVID-19 case 9 .
