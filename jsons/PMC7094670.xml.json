Bovine coronavirus has been described to be involved in winter dysentery in adults (Saif, 1990; Alenius et al., 1991), calf diarrhea (Stair et al., 1972), and in respiratory disease of young stock (McNulty et al., 1984). Bovine respiratory syncytial virus is recognized as one of the most important causes of respiratory tract disease in beef and dairy cattle, especially in young animals (Stott et al., 1980; Verhoeff et al., 1984; Elvander, 1996).",

Among 113 dairy herds in the Ithaca area (New York, NY), a 33% incidence of winter dysentery was recorded over a 9-mo period (White et al., 1989). Bulk tank milk data, reflecting the antibody status of lactating cows, also showed very high nationwide prevalences of BCV (89.2 to 100%; Paton et al., 1998; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999) and BRSV infections (70 to 100%; Elvander, 1996; Paton et al., 1998) in the UK and Sweden. The use of a BRSV vaccine is considered to have a minimal effect on antibody levels, as its implementation was rare in UK (Paton et al., 1998) and not used at all in Sweden. Furthermore, there is no BCV vaccination program in Sweden, and none was mentioned in Paton et al. (1998). Moreover, a high BCV and BRSV infection burden and spread in calves has been recently demonstrated in the southwestern part of Sweden (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006). Measures to control the spread of these infections may be warranted, because infectious diseases are likely to have detrimental effects on the animals and their productivity. However, information on the production effects associated with these infections on a dairy farm remains scarce, and an assessment of production effects at the farm level might contribute to support decision-making for control.",

Testing of such samples by ELISA has recently been recognized as a suitable method to detect the putative presence of cows with antibodies to BCV or BRSV in dairy herds: there was good agreement between results of individual samples and the results of pooled samples (Ohlson et al., 2009). Such a strategy has been successfully used to determine BVDV herd status on a large scale (Lindberg and Alenius, 1999). Compared with assessment of bulk tank milk, a more immediate assessment of herd status was achieved by sampling young cows, as the antibodies may remain detectable for years without reinfection. The sampling was performed by veterinarians and technicians. Ten-milliliter test tubes containing 1.5 mg of the preservative agent Bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1.3-diol, Steins Laboratory, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden) were used. The samples were not diluted or centrifuged and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. The milk samples were analyzed for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV (Alenius et al., 1991) and BRSV (Elvander et al., 1995) by commercially available indirect ELISA (Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The same batch was used for all analyses. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was corrected by subtraction of the negative control antigen OD. To adjust for day-to-day variations, the percentage positivity (PP) was calculated as follows: (corrected OD/positive control corrected OD) \u00d7 100. Cut-off was set to PP equal to 20, corresponding to a corrected OD of 0.20, which is the cut-off recommended by the manufacturer for individual milk samples. Using serum, the sensitivity and specificity of the BCV assay, relative to a virus neutralization test, were estimated to be 84.6 and 100%, respectively (91 sera from 9 Swedish dairy herds; Alenius et al., 1991). Corresponding values for the BRSV assay were 94.0 and 100%, respectively, relative to an established ELISA in use at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (Weybridge, UK; 157 sera from Swedish and English herds; Elvander et al., 1995). The 2 assays have been recognized to work equally well in milk and serum [S. Alenius (Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), personal communication; Elvander et al., 1995]. The same PP cut-off of 20 was applied to pooled milk samples, because Ohlson et al. (2009) found a good agreement (97 and 94%) between results of individual and pooled samples for BCV and BRSV assays, respectively. Therefore, a herd was considered as positive if the PP value was \u226520, and negative otherwise.",

The associations between herd-status and TDMY or TDSCC (after logarithmic transformation) were assessed using mixed linear models, after adjustment for herd, cow, DIM, parity, breed, and season. The models (MIXED procedure, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) were as follows:Y=m+BRSVi+BCVj+DIMk+LNl+BRm+   SEASn+Ho+COWp+eijklmnop,where Y is the TDMY or the log-transformed TDSCC; m is the overall mean; BRSVi is the fixed effect of BRSV-related herd-status i (3 classes for type I, 2 classes for type II, 5 classes for type III); BCVj is the fixed effect of BCV-related herd-status j (3 classes for type I, 2 classes for type II, 5 classes for type III); DIMk is the fixed effect of class k of DIM (13 classes); LNl is the fixed effect of class l of lactation number (5 classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and \u22655); BRm is the fixed effect of class m of breed (3 classes: Swedish Red, Swedish Holstein, others); SEASn is the fixed effect of class n of season (2 classes: October to December, January to April); Ho is the random effect of herd o (65 herds); COWp is the random effect of cow p within herd o; and eijklmnop is the residual. For each class variable, dummy coding was done setting the reference level to zero: each estimate thus measures the effect of each nonreference level compared with the reference level. The cow taken as reference was in a FREE herd when considering type I and III statuses, and in an O-N herd for type II status. To account for correlations between test days within cow, a compound symmetry variance matrix was used. A first-order autoregressive variance matrix was initially attempted for TDMY because other research (Gr\u00f6hn et al., 1999) has indicated that it may be the most appropriate, but the models did not converge.",

Cows with no information on subsequent calving but a successful pregnancy check after first AI and no subsequent recorded AI were considered as experiencing a success. Other situations were considered as failure. However, cows with no subsequent events (AI, pregnancy checks, culling, calving) recorded after first AI or culled within 200 d after first AI were considered as noninformative, because their outcomes could not be reliably defined; they were then excluded from the analyses. Preliminary investigations showed that the proportions of noninformative animals did not differ statistically (P\n > 0.05) according to the BCV and BRSV infection status of the herd to which they belonged. Only first AI occurring between October 1, 2006, and April 30, 2007, or between October 1, 2007, and April 30, 2008 were considered for analyses. The association between herd status and \u201ccalving after first service\u201d was assessed using a mixed logistic regression model.

The cow taken as a reference had a success; that is, a calving or positive pregnancy check after first AI, in a FREE herd when considering type I and III statuses, and in an O-N herd for type II status.

The observations analyzed were the length of life, defined for each animal as the number of days between d 3 after birth and the mortality day, or if still alive, the last day of the period-at-risk.

The assumption of proportionality was not rejected (P\n > 0.05) in any model (results not shown). To account for clustering (i.e., animals are not independent within herd), the data were fitted by using the robust sandwich estimate (Wei et al., 1989) for statistical inference (computation of robust estimates of standard errors). An adjusted relative hazard ratio (HR) was estimated for each covariate by taking the exponent of the estimates of effects. This HR measures the instantaneous hazard for a calf to die when exposed (e.g., in RI or PSI herds) versus being unexposed (e.g., in FREE herds).",

These results are in accordance in direction with those reported by Norstr\u00f6m et al.

However, Norstr\u00f6m et al. (2001) hypothesized that their result could be largely underestimated; their estimate was similar to the one reported by Van der Poel et al.

Information about the relative proportion of primary infected and reinfected cows (assumed to be severely affected and to have a smaller loss in milk yield, respectively) in the affected herds was lacking in their study.

These findings were in agreement with biological expectations and with the literature. The mortality rate can reach 20% in some severe outbreaks (Stott et al., 1980), and pneumonia and cough are recognized as major risk factors for death early in life (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; Curtis et al., 1988; van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2002; Svensson et al., 2006). These estimates were, however, not significantly different from unity, possibly because of a lack of statistical power because of the relatively low sample sizes (2,716 cows with a first AI within the periods-at-risk and 4,104 calves and heifers at risk of mortality, respectively). Further studies are needed to confirm or reject the trends observed here. We also observed a significant increase in SCC (of more than 10,000 cells/mL) for cows in herds with a BRSV outbreak. This increase cannot only be caused by a concentration effect, because the increase would have been about 3,000 cells/mL if exclusively in relation to the associated reduction in milk yield (\u22120.91 kg/d) observed in the same herds.",

First, the decreased milk yield associated with winter dysentery, even if large in magnitude (on average 22%), is often described as being of short duration (<2 wk; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n, 2000). Therefore, if it exists, such an effect would have been difficult to detect using test-day records, which are usually performed 1 mo apart. Second, the TDMY used for comparisons were all those within the period-at-risk (i.e., from October year n to April year n\n + 1), whereas winter is known to be a predisposing factor for BCV outbreaks (Saif, 1990). Thus, this strategy may have \u201csmoothed\u201d the possible decrease in milk yield associated with an outbreak over the whole period-at-risk. However, no precise (and reliable) information on actual dates of possible outbreaks were available and a more detailed analysis could therefore not be performed.",

            "text": "This second explanation may be less likely, because the milk yield in presumably RI-N herds was found to be significantly lower than in RI-Y (Table 2). Because both these groups experienced a recent BCV circulation, this finding might suggest that herds in which the owner noticed a presumably BCV-related clinical outbreak are better managed to some extent with higher performance. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that only 3 of the 28 herds with a presumably BCV-related clinical outbreak also had a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (for which a decrease in milk yield was observed; Table 1). In addition, it may be questioned if all outbreaks classified as BCV related were indeed related to BCV infection, because signs of diarrhea (the main criterion to define an outbreak) may well be related to other factors; for instance, related to feeding regimens, especially in high-performing herds where cows are more sensitive. This reason for misclassification was deemed not differential between herds exhibiting or not exhibiting specific antibodies to BCV, because the farmers were not aware of the status of their herd when they declared the observed clinical signs. In that context, the presumably BCV-related outbreaks might have been overestimated in our study. The same may not necessarily apply for cough, for which the risk of misclassification toward BRSV infection was deemed lower.",

However, for the latter, the relationships found here should be confirmed in a larger study. The quantitative estimates of production effects associated with this infection will be useful information to assess its economic impact, as well as the profitability of control schemes that could be implemented on farms. In contrast, BCV infection, identified here based on either the dynamics of BCV-specific antibody levels over time or the occurrence of a presumably related outbreak, was not significantly associated with any production losses in cows from the infected herds compared with those in the FREE herds. These findings were unexpected because severe decrease in milk yield in cows with winter dysentery, as well as increased calf mortality, were identified in previous descriptions of outbreaks. Because the consequences on performances associated with BCV-related outbreaks are probably of short duration in most situations, case-control investigations relying on very reliable identification and dating of the BCV-related outbreak and of the corresponding period-at-risk, and targeting daily performance records would be a profitable area of research.",
