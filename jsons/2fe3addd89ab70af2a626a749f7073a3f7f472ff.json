The study of respiratory pathogen transmission dynamics is nothing new, previous studies have clearly shown that large droplets can travel more than 6 m away in a sneeze, 2 m away in a cough and around 1 m during normal breathing (Xie et al., 2007) . However, the results of recent studies, some in coronavirus patients provides an important reminder on the theoretical rationale for the possible limited benefit of some current public health prevention recommendations on physical distancing and masking as explained in this article.",

Even so, any masks even homemade masks when utilized properly can help reduce transmission compared to no mask at all as reported in several studies (Ma et al., 2020; Van Der Sande et al., 2008) . A qualitative small laboratory study has even showed that using a cloth to cover one's mouth during speaking reduces emission of droplets (Anfinrud et al., 2020) . It is important to note that for an effective implement the public needs to be educated on its proper use and that it is not a replacement, but must be done in synergy with intensifying other prevention practices such as frequent handwashing and more extensive physical distancing measures.",
