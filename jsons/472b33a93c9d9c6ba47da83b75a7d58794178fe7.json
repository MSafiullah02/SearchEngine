Sepsis occurs at a rate of 8-42.5 % in burn patients with a mortality of 28-65 % [ 46 ] . Much research has been conducted in the optimal management of the septic patient. The following Table 4 .5 summarizes the guidelines as recommended by the surviving sepsis campaign committee [ 47 ] . Only the strong recommendations with high level of evidence are included. This is to be used as a tool to guide the delivery of optimal clinical care for patients with sepsis and septic shock. The ABA criteria for de fi nition of sepsis (see Box 4.1 ) in the burn patients have been established. However, Mann-Salinas and colleagues have challenged the predictive ability of ABA criteria demonstrating that their multivariable model (heart rate >130, MAP <60 mmHg, base de fi cit < \u22126 mEq/L, temperature <36 \u00b0C, use of vasoactive medications, and glucose >150 mg/dL) is capable of outperforming the ABA model [ 48 ] .
