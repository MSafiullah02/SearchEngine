Preliminary data suggest a relationship between the BCG vaccine and the prevalence of Covid-19. The BCG vaccine is used in the prevention of tuberculosis, a disease that is most prevalent in developing countries. To determine the potential protective role of BCG vaccination, this study investigated the occurrence of Covid-19 and the relationship between the spread of Covid-19 in countries that offer BCG vaccination and those that do not. The study also performed a phylogenetic analysis of the strains involved in the Covid-19 outbreak from the representative countries. To achieve the objectives, the study utilized publicly available data on population size, vaccination coverage, and Covid-19 cases. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine if some SARS-CoV-2 strains were more prevalent than others. The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer the BCG vaccine to the general population and the reported cases of Covid-19. The study proposes future molecular and immunological analyses to determine the potential role of BCG vaccination in protection against Covid-19. This will determine if BCG has antiviral properties, with the possibility of recommending it for widespread use if supported by scientific data.",

            "text": "Over the last century, mankind has faced numerous pandemics associated with the emergence of new microorganisms, the latest being the Covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Andersen et al., 2020) . As of 30th April 2020, this virus was present in 212 countries and territories (Kang et al., 2020) . Pandemics occur when novel microorganisms, usually viruses emerge as a result of mutations capable of coding for new potentiator biomolecules such as the spike glycoprotein by SARS-CoV-2 . Consequently, the new machinery may enable the pathogen to jump between hosts, for instance from bats to pangolins and then from the intermediate host to humans (Andersen et al., 2020) . Prompt data collection of the novel organisms is critical to understanding behavioral and infectious trends of these pathogens, and in disease mitigation by generating relevant antimicrobial agents (AMA) and vaccines. Efforts to generate effective AMA for novel organisms are challenged by limited understanding of the infectious agent, and hence monitoring basic trends becomes crucial. Following the spread of Covid-19, there have been mixed and unprecedented trends, and varying findings are still accumulating. Interestingly, for instance, countries that immensely practice BCG vaccination against tuberculosis (TB), caused by a bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that has a deleterious respiratory effect (Curtis et al., n.d.) , have generally reported low infection rates which has led to suggestions that BCG vaccination could be slowing or helping in the protection against n.d.) . Previous studies have demonstrated that the BCG vaccine has non-specific beneficial effects (Curtis et al., n.d.) (Uthayakumar et al., 2018) , including increased protection from a variety of respiratory infectious diseases (Prentice et al., 2015) . Some of these studies have revealed possible epigenetic changes that subsequently regulate cytokine production (Uthayakumar et al., 2018) (Arts et al., 2018) . Coincidentally, most Covid-19 victims die due to unregulated cytokine production.",

Interestingly, Iran, a country that abandoned offering a booster BCG vaccine in 1999 (Zwerling et al., 2011) , registered high cases of Covid-19 (Fig 3) . It is, however, hard to postulate the impact that may have had on Covid-19 incidences. The low number of cases in China could be due to the underlying effects of BCG vaccination and/or massive efforts by the government to contain the virus. Overall, countries with low TB incidences (mostly western countries) that do not administer the BCG vaccine to the general population had the highest Covid-19 cases per million people. Countries such as England stopped the BCG vaccination in 2005 (Fine, 2005) whereas Australia abandoned its program in the 1980s due to a reduction of tuberculosis incidences (Zwerling et al., 2011) . India has an expansive BCG vaccination program (Zwerling et al., 2011) . The country registered 27 cases per million people by the end of April 2020. Additionally, India's reported first case was on 1/30/2020 (Table 1) , and by April 5, 2020, the 1.3 billion people in India were put into lockdown. This precaution could have added to the containment of the virus spread. An even more interesting contrast was the low number of Covid-19 cases in the United States' southern neighbor, Mexico; while Mexico reported (152 cases per million by the end of April 2020, the USA had 3,424 cases per million by the same date. A similar trend was seen between the USA and Argentina, a South American state with high BCG vaccination coverage.",

Regression analysis revealed a strong association between low numbers of Covid-19 cases and BCG vaccination (mean value of 75.54%) (Fig. 3) . However, high numbers of Covid-19 cases cannot be explained by the lack of BCG vaccination alone. There are other risk factors such as comorbidity, age, and socio-economic factors including living conditions (Guan et al., 2020b) (Yang et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic analysis using genomic data reveals that some countries that were highly impacted shared strains with the same ancestral nodes with those with less Covid-19 reported cases (Fig. 4) . This could mean shared strains alone may not determine cases, but BCG, which is shared among those reporting lower cases could be one factor, among other confounders. Further analysis revealed clade A2a was most common in Africa, North and South America, Europe, and Asia (Fig. 5) . Clade A2a was curiously the most common in New York City's most affected areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Westchester (Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020) . The populations in New York City boroughs and its neighborhoods are considerably high. But these are not as poorly sanitized regions as slums in developing countries (Corburn and Hildebrand, 2015) . Further, overcrowding (such as Kenya's Kibera slums which has 30,000 persons per square mile) (Njuguna et al., 2013) , poor infrastructure, and inadequate social amenities (Kamau and Njiru, 2018) , would have led to a catastrophic situation. Further, looking at Saudi Arabia and Egypt (both with >95% BCG coverage) emphasizes the possible existence of other confounders besides BCG vaccination (Table1).",

The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer BCG vaccinations to the general population and reported cases of Covid-19. Whereas the study established a correlation, other factors could have contributed to observed differences including but not limited to, test capabilities, demographics, and disease burden. To elucidate direct antiviral benefits of BCG vaccination, molecular analysis to determine the role of BCG vaccination and potential protection against coronaviruses should be investigated. If BCG is found to have coronavirus protection benefits, the clinical need for a BCG vaccination should be evaluated in countries that do not administer BCG vaccination, particularly vulnerable and easily exposed population groups, such as, the elderly, those with comorbidities and healthcare workers. Moreover, evidence of protection against viral respiratory infectious agents should underscore the need for developing countries to continue the administration of BCG vaccination promptly to offer continued beneficial effects on its population.",
