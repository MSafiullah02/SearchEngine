Neutralizing antibody to calf diarrhea coronavirus was detected in serum samples from all species except goat, hamster, and chicken. The incidence of antibody in titers of 2 or higher ranged from 22 to 100%, and high incidences, exceeding 70%, were obtained in cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, rats, and human beings. High titers were detected especially in cattle, pigs, and rats, some animals having titers of even 2,048 or higher. Similar high incidences of neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to calf diarrhea coronavirus have been reported in normal adult cattle and pigs (II) . These serological results suggest that calf diarrhea coronavirus or antigenically related virus(es) occur commonly in these animal species in Japan. The present observation that swine and rat sera, like bovine sera, showed not only high antibody incidence but also frequent high antibody titers for calf diarrhea coronavirus may suggest close antigenic relationships between calf diarrhea coronavirus and coronaviruses occurring in pigs and rats. However, our recent study (II) showed that there is a marked antigenic difference between calf diarrhea coronavirus and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine (7), although there is some cross reaction.
