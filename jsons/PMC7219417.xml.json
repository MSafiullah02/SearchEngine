To this end, we first recorded, for each determination of D-dimer levels, whether the patient had developed PE 3, 6, 9 or 12 days after that determination. Then, separately for each of these time lags (e.g., 3 days), we fitted a mixed-effects logistic regression, with the presence of PE as the dependent binary variable (i.e., the future outcome that we wished to predict), D-dimer levels as the independent variable (i.e., the variable that we wished to use for predicting), and the subject identification as a random factor (to adjust for repeated measures). Initially we also aimed to conduct this analysis using shorter time lags (1 or 2 days), but we could not correctly fit the corresponding mixed-effects logistic regressions due to singularity. This analysis was conducted with the \u201clme4\u2033 package for R [2].",

Zhou and cols, in a retrospective, multicentric cohort study conducted in China described increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL on admission [4]. Tang et al. [5], in a series that included 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, found that patients with abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, had a higher risk of death. Furthermore, Gao and cols found that D-dimer levels were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 disease in adult patients [6]. In line with these findings, anticoagulant treatment has been found to be associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 disease meeting the criteria for sepsis-induced coagulopathy or with markedly elevated D-dimer levels [7].",
