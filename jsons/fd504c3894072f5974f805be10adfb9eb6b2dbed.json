Here, we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of SADS-CoV in pigs in China. Our results suggest that SADS-CoV has emerged in China at least since August 2016. Meanwhile, we detected a prevalence of SADS-CoV (43.53%), porcine deltacoronavirus (8.83%), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (78.25%), rotavirus (21.77%), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), and we also found the co-infection of SADS-CoV and PEDV occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65%. We screened and obtained two new complete genomes, five N and five S genes of SADS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences revealed that all SADS-CoV sequences in this study clustered with previously reported SADS-CoV strains to form a well defined branch that grouped with the bat coronavirus HKU2",

So far, six coronaviruses have been identified from pigs, which include porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), SADS-CoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) that all belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus, as well as one betacoronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and one deltacoronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016; Wesley, Woods, & Cheung, 1991; Woo et al., 2010) . Among these viruses, SADS-CoV is the most newly discovered coronavirus, which has been first reported in 2017 in China and is considered to be an HKU2-related coronavirus with a bat-origin (Gong et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) . In January 2017, SADS-CoV was detected in a swine farm and subsequently spread rapidly to three other farms in *These authors contributed equally to this work. Guangdong Province and caused the fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) characterized by the clinical signs with severe, acute diarrhoea and rapid weight loss of piglets. The symptoms of SADS-CoV are similar to those that caused by other swine enteric coronaviruses such as PDCoV and PEDV, but SADS-CoV is more harmful than these viruses because it has led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in a short time and resulted in more significant economic losses (Dong et al., 2015; Sun, Wang, Wei, Chen, & Feng, 2016; Zhou et al., 2018) . So, it is urgent to investigate the molecular epidemiology and transmission patterns of SADS-CoV for establishing effective controls for this new coronavirus.",

Our results showed that the first SADS-CoV positive sample was collected in August 2016 from the farm LS with a history of diarrhoea, as well as from other two farms TP and ZW, which indicates that SADS-CoV has emerged in pigs in China at least since August 2016. And this time point is 5 months earlier than the first discovered time reported by our previous study (Zhou et al., 2018) . As the same time, clinical signs of SADS-CoV during the retrospective investigation included sever and acute vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to death in piglets that were less than 5 days of age with a mortality rate of around 50%. These clinical presentations were similar to those signs in the large scale outbreak of SADS-CoV reported by Zhou et al. (2018) , except the mortality rate in piglets later increased to 90%.",

The two new genomes of SADS-CoV sequences in this work shared 100% nucleotides identities with the sequence MF167434 published by Gong et al. (2017) and our four previously reported sequences (Zhou et al., 2018) , and shared 99.8% nucleotides identities with the sequence MF370205 studied by Pan et al. (2017) . The results suggest that these eight SADS-CoV sequences may come from the same origin. Only the phylogenetic tree of S genes in our work showed that sequences of the AlphaCoV were divided into two sublineages, AlphaCoV1 which contained all SADS-CoV sequences and AlphaCoV2, clustering together with sequences of the BeltaCoV and the DelatCov, respectively. And this result was consistent with the study of Pan et al. (2017) . As a newly discovered coronavirus, the availability of SADS-CoV sequences data is limited which prevents better understandings of the molecular epidemiology of this virus. Meanwhile, being a RNA virus, SADS-CoV may mutate rapidly and exhibit high genetic differences (Drummond, Pybus, Rambaut, Forsberg, & Rodrigo, 2003; K\u00fchnert, Wu, & Drummond, 2011 ",

The farms SM, GL, DL, DE, TP, WT, DCD, and SC were in Qingyuan, and the farms LS, ZW, and YX were in Shaoguan. From these eleven SADS-CoV-positive farms, a total of 170 archived diarrheal samples including 55 faeces and 115 intestinal contents were collected to further investigate diarrhoeal pathogens including SADS-CoV, PEDV, RV, PDCoV, and TGEV. The infection rates of these five pathogens in order were 43.5% (74/170), 78.2% (133/170), 21.8% (37/170), 8.8% (15/170), and 0% (0/170). SADS-CoV was tested positively both in the intestinal and faecal samples and the detection rates were 49.6% (57/115) and 30.9% (17/55), respectively, which were both the second highest among the five tested pathogens. PEDV had the highest positive rate at 84.3% (97/115) for intestinal and 65.5% (36/55) for faecal samples. TGEV was tested negatively in all 170 diarrheal samples (Table S2). The cases of individual infection or co-infection for SADS-CoV, PDCoV, PEDV, and RV were also detected. More than half the samples were only infected by one of the four viruses at a rate of 58.82% (100/170), and the individual infection of PEDV had the highest rate of 37.06% (63/170). In the 74 SADS-CoV-positive samples, 28 samples were infected alone by SADS-CoV, and the rest 46 samples were infected by SADS-CoV combined with one to three other pathogens. The co-infection of SADS-CoV and PEDV occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65% (30/170) (Table 1).The earliest cases with SADS-CoV-positive infection were found in the farms LS, TP and ZW on August 2016 according toTable S2.The intestinal contents from these eleven farms were tested positive for SADS-CoV and the positive rates ranged from 25% to 77.78%.While the faecal samples from two farms ZW and YX were tested negative for SADS-CoV, but positive for PDCoV, PEDV, and RV infections. The positive rates of SADS-CoV in the faecal samples of other nine farms varied from 13.33% to 100%. The farm LS had the highest positive rate of 77.8% (7/9) for intestinal samples and the farms DCD and SC had 100% positive rates for faecal samples.",

The lengths of the complete genome, N gene and S gene were 27,163 bp, 1,128 bp, and 3,390 bp, respectively. The two new complete sequences, five N genes and five S genes sequences each shared high sequence identities of 99.8%-100%, 99.8%-100%, and 99.6%-100% with previous reported complete genomes, N genes and S genes of SADS-CoV. The two full-length sequences of SADS-CoV showed 95%-95.1% nucleotide identities with four bat coronavirus HKU2 strains, and the nucleotide identities between the N genes of SADS-CoV studied here and those of bat coronavirus HKU2 strains ranged from 94.2% to 94.3%. The S genes of SADS-CoV in this paper shared low nucleotide identities of 79.9%-80% with the S genes of bat coronavirus HKU2 strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genomes, N genes and S genes indicated that all SADS-CoV sequences clustered together to form a well-defined branch and group with four bat coronavirus HKU2 strains In the phylogenetic trees of the full-length genomes and N genes, all SADS-CoV strains were phylogenetically located within the AlphaCoVs, while the phylogenetic tree of S genes exhibited that all SADS-CoV sequences, four bat HKU2 and two BtRf-AlphaCoV strains separated from other AlpaCoVs sequences and clustered with the BeltaCoV sequences (Figures 2, 3 and 4). 4 | DISCUSSION In this study, we performed the retrospective investigation of SADS-CoV in 45 pig farms from Guangdong Province based on 236 F I G U R E 1 Locations of positive farms for study of SADS-CoV in Guangdong Province, China [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] ZHOU ET AL.",

Meanwhile, of the SADS-CoV positive samples, 62.2% were co-infections with one to four other viruses, revealing a high prevalence of co-infection in the sampled farms. Notably, our results also showed that SADS-CoV and PEDV were simultaneously present in all co-infection samples of SADA-CoV. Considering the fact that PEDV has caused prior outbreaks of the porcine diarrhoea at the pig farm where Zhou et al. (2018) later reported the occurrence of SADS-CoV, PEDV seems to be able to contribute to the infection of SADS-CoV in pigs. Thus, SADS-CoV may be pathogenic as secondary infection following the infection of PEDV, which needs further studies to better understand the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus.",

In summary, our retrospective study suggests that SADS-CoV has emerged in pigs in China at least since August 2016. The severe clinical symptoms and the strong transmission in short term highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control this new discovered virus. Further studies, such as the epidemiology, virology and pathobiology should be performed for better understanding of SADS-CoV in China.
