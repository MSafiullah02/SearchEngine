            "text": "The viral genome analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-II was a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an unidentified-origin coronavirus [13,14]. While the human transmission is presumably from the animals, there is still inconclusive whether the animal origins in the human transmission chain are from bats, snakes, or others [11,15,16]. However, there were positive virus findings in the environmental samples from the seafood industry and the seafood markets. The respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing are the primary mediums for human-to-human transmission [17]. The frequent symptoms of respiratory illnesses, i.e., a fever higher than 38.1 \u00b0C (98% of patients), coughing fits (76% of patients), and finally severe fatigue or myalgia (44% of patients) have been reported in several patients [18]. Dyspnea (55% of patients) appears after eight days and is the first severe complication of the disease. However, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea have been reported as clinical manifestations of COVID-19 [18,19]. A study from China also reported that the majority of patients (80.9%) were considered to have mild pneumonia or being asymptomatic, which posed big challenges for the spreading of COVID-19 [20]. The close contact to infected individuals, either asymptomatic or clinical COVID-19 cases, increase the risk of infection. The monitor of a cluster of COVID-19 cases in China suggested the possibility of indirect viral transmission without a history of close physical connection to the infected individuals. The viral transfer is possible through the common contaminated objects, viral aerosolization in confined space, or from the asymptomatic viral carriers [21].",

In the second position comes diabetes, without a distinction of the type being made, which affects 16.2% of the most severe cases [30,31].",

The potential mechanisms include the antiviral immune induction, the modulation of immunoregulatory defense, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and genetic or epigenetic regulation [66]. Furthermore, the risk of viral infections can be reduced by vitamin D. The related mechanisms comprised of stimulation of defensins and cathelicidins that can decrease the replication of virus and increase levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreasing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce inflammation-related pneumonia [67]. Supportive data for the effective role of vitamin D in decreasing risk of COVID-19 could be highlighted by increased case-fatality rates with chronic disease comorbidity and age, in which lower concentrations of 25(OH)D have been reported. Vitamin D deficiency is globally prevalent, particularly in the elders [68]. Over half of the hospitalized elders and nursing home residents in the U.S. had vitamin D deficiency [69,70]. This high prevalence probably contributes to the first outbreak COVID-19 during winter and the high mortality rate in older adults [[71], [72], [73], [74]]. While the natural source of vitamin D is from sunlight exposure, some dietary sources can provide a certain amount of vitamin D, including the fortified cereals and milk. However, for people at risk of COVID-19, the goal should be to raise the concentrations of 25(OH)D above 40\u201360 ng/ml (100\u2013150 nmol/l) by considering taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.

The immune-modulating effects in respiratory infection of vitamin C are also well-documented [[83], [84], [85], [86]]. Nevertheless, the supporting evidence of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory diseases are inconclusive [[87], [88], [89], [90]]. In alignment with the evidence of other micronutrients, the supplementation could benefit the vitamin C deficient individual but not in the healthy subjects [87,88]. Moreover, it has been reported that megadoses administration of Vitamin C before or after the appearance of flu symptoms could prevent and relieve the flu symptoms in the test population regarding the control group [83,86,91,92]. Based on 31 study comparisons with 9745 common cold episodes, it has been revealed that the regular supplementation of Vitamin C had a modest but consistent effect in decreasing the duration of common cold symptoms [89,90]. Furthermore, five trials with 598 participants showed that vitamin C decreased the risk of common cold without any adverse effects [93]. Vitamin C supplementation is thus the sensible option to prevent and support the immune responses in the micronutrient-deficit individual at risk for COVID-19.",

            "text": "As the integral part of several selenoproteins, including the glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, selenium has a critical role in the defense against viral infection through its antioxidant, redox signaling, and redox homeostatic contributions [94]. Selenium deficiency is associated with increased pathogenicity of several virus infections [[95], [96], [97]]. In the deficient state, the selenium supplementation is helpful for the prevention and treatment of viral infections [[97], [98], [99], [100]]. Recently, it has been reported that a mild strain of influenza virus, also shows increased virulence in selenium-deficient mice. Increased virulence is related to several modifications in the viral genome [95,101]. Furthermore, the immune response, such as proinflammatory chemokines, can be increased in selenium-deficient mice. Moreover, the mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) were changed in selenium-deficient mice. The mRNA levels of cytokine were also modified in the selenium-deficient mice. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 were increased, whereas \u03b3-interferon and Interleukin (IL)-2 were decreased, which suggests a modification toward a pattern of T-helper-2-like in the Se-deficient mice regarding the pattern of T-helper-1-like in the Se-adequate mice [95]. Therefore, selenium intake differentially affects numerous types of immune responses and related mechanisms, revealing an effective role of selenium-supplementation in viral diseases.",

Zinc is essential for normal function and development of cells regulating nonspecific immunity, including natural killer cells and neutrophils. Zinc is the main structural component of around 750 zinc-finger transcription factors [102]. The deficiency of zinc also modifies the development of acquired immunity by limiting both the certain and outgrowth functions of T lymphocytes, including the production and activation of Th1 cytokine [103]. The function of macrophage also is adversely affected by the deficiency of zinc through the dysregulation of cytokine production, intracellular killing, and phagocytosis [103]. Zinc deficiency is surprisingly common in modern-day lifestyle [104]. Zinc deficiency impairs the antiviral immunity, particularly to herpes simplex, common cold, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [104,105]. A meta-analysis of oral zinc supplementation studies suggested beneficial effects on the shortened of symptoms and duration of common cold infection [[106], [107], [108]]. Zinc supplementation was also helpful against hepatitis C virus infection through the induction of metallothionein expressions [109,110]. Moreover, research has shown that zinc has antiviral effects; it improves immune responses and suppresses viral replication. Therefore, the consumption of up to 50 mg zinc per day may provide a protective role against the COVID-19 pandemic, likely by improving the host's resistance against viral infection [102]. However, these studies did not account for the underlying zinc status in the studied participants.",

Remdesivir inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which crucially replicates copies of viral RNA in the host cells. The animal models and cell line studies suggested the effectiveness of remdesivir to selectively inhibit the infection and pathology of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-II [125,126]. While the proofreading exoribonuclease hampers the effects of most nucleotide-base antiviral treatment, remdesivir inhibits coronavirus with the intact proofreading, thus renders its superior antiviral efficacy [127]. The experimental treatment of intravenous remdesivir in the first COVID-19 patient in the U.S. showed an impressive response [128]. There is a current randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in COVID-19 [129].",

With the updated knowledge of the SARS-CoV-II molecular mechanisms, there are several studies on monoclonal antibody and their trials for COVID-19, conducted by many pharmaceutical companies. Some previously approved drugs for other conditions and several novel drugs target various molecular targets of SARS-CoV II infection, with the promising therapeutic outcome for COVID-19 management soon [163,164]. These clinical trials include the monoclonal antibodies that target the pathogenic and pathophysiologic processes of COVID-19. These trials comprise the tocilizumab, which targets the interleukin-6 receptor and possibly mediates the SARS-CoV II-mediated inflammation and modulates the cytokine storms, and several neutralized monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV molecular mechanism [163,165].",
