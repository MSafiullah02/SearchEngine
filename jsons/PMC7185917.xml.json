The researchers in the ALSPAC study groups have already been meritorious in perinatal psychiatric research\u2014eg, in examining how maternal perinatal anxiety and depression might be associated with offspring depression.8 The relationship between maternal antenatal depressed mood and offspring psychotic continuum has been previously studied in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966,6 and the current study adds valuable knowledge to these studies.",

Additionally, many important confounding factors were accounted for, including genetic data, which adds knowledge about shared and mediating factors between perinatal depression and offspring outcomes.",

Its aims are better detection and management of perinatal mental disorders to reduce adverse child outcomes and to decrease the intergenerational transmission of mental disorders. Although knowledge is increasing, more research is needed to clarify the associations between parental and offspring mental illness, and this study adds important information on this research area. More detailed investigation on the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of mental disorders might result in new innovations for perinatal psychiatric therapies. Furthermore, perinatal psychiatric intervention studies are crucial to provide evidence-based guidelines on effective treatment of perinatal mental disorders for clinicians. Clear guidelines are needed to be able to support new parents and their babies more efficiently, especially in these times of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, filled with anxiety and worries.",
