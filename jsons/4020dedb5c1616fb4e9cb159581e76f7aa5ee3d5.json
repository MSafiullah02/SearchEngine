PED case reports from seven countries and PED surveillance and monitoring activities in thirteen countries were reported. This information was combined with an extensive literature review to provide an update on global PED occurrence, circulating strains and impact in 2014-2015. PED confirmed cases have been reported in North America, South America, Asia and Europe.

In May 2015, the number of PED case reports decreased until August 2015, while a slight increase was again observed in September 2015.

The isolate was a variant strain with a relatively far relationship with the PEDV strains previously identified in the same area between 2011 and 2012 and was genetically distinct from the CV777-based vaccine strain currently being used in China Full-length genome analysis -Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the CH/GDZQ/2014 strain had a relatively far relationship with four variant PEDV strains (CH/GD-01, CH/GDGZ/2012, GD-A, and GD-1) identified in Guangdong between 2011 and 2012, indicating that CH/GDZQ/2014 was genetically distinct from these strains. Sequence homology analysis showed that CH/ GDZQ/2014 had 96.7% nt identity with the prototype CV777 strain but shared 97.8-99.0% nt identity with the variant PEDV strains that have emerged since 2010 in China and 98.8% nt identity with two newly identified US strains S gene sequences -The S protein of CH/GDZQ/2014 had 93.1-98.6% nt identity with the reference strains, showing the lowest identity with the CV777-based vaccine strain (NC_003436) and the highest identity with two Chinese strains (BJ-2011-1 and JS--positive sample from a sow with very mild clinical sign was used to inoculate in Vero cells to isolate the virus The phylogenetic trees based upon either the complete genome or S gene showed that the FL2013 strain belongs to the genogroup G2bstrains prevalent in the U.S. and China currently, but had a short deletion at the intestinal homogenates and two faeces samples were collected from pigs that had severe diarrhoea and a high mortality rate at 11 farms Full-length genome analysis -The 11 whole genomes exhibited nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 97.5% to 99.7%, with no insertions or deletions. The phylogenetic tree of 49 PEDV genomes indicated that the PEDV isolates could be divided into two clusters, designated the pandemic group and the classical group. Thirty-nine Chinese and American strains isolated after 2008 comprised the pandemic group. The classical group comprised 10 strains, including 3 Korean strains (SM98, DR13, and attenuated DR13), 6 Chinese strains (CH/S, LZC, SD-M, attenuated vaccine, JS2008, and JS2008 new), and 1 European strain (CV777) tracts were collected from dead piglets during an outbreak of diarrhoea on a breeding farm in Shanghai in 2013 Full-length genome sequencing -Identities ranging from 96.6% to 99.8% to other strains; the highest level of similarity, with JS-HZ2012, was 99.8%. Based on analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the PEDV ORF1a and ORF1b, all of the PEDV strainscould be divided into three groups. Group 1 comprised one Chinese strain (LZC), one Korean strain (SM98) and one European strain (CV777). Group 2 consisted of vaccine strains (attenuated DR13) and two Chinese PEDV field strains (SD-M and JS2008). Group 3 was made up of virulent DR13, 10 USA strains isolated in 2013 and 16 Chinese strains (except CH/S), which were isolated from China during PED outbreaks in 2011-2013. The S gene shared 93.8-99.4% nucleotide sequence identity with those of other PEDV strains (Table 2).

The complete S gene of PEDV HN1303 was sequenced and analysed, and the results showed that HN1303 shares 94.0% and 92.8% nucleotide and amino acid identities with CV777 vaccine strain, respectively. Phylogenetic tree based on S gene indicates that theHN1303 strain belongs to genotype IIa, a recently prevalent genotype Suckling pigs from several sows showed mild diarrhoea and vomiting in a breed-to-wean farm Full-length genome sequence -Comparative sequence analysis showed that the complete genome of Tottori2/JPN/2014 strain had 99.73-99.87%, 99.64-99.69% and 98.90-99.45% nucleotide sequence identity with those of North American clades I and II and US S INDEL PEDV strains used in this analysis, respectively. A phylogenetic dendrogram constructed using the sequence data without considering gaps indicated that the Tottori2 PEDV strain was included in a cluster in North American clade I and was most closely related to US PEDV strain Iowa103 S gene sequences -Phylogenetic analysis of S genes demonstrated that the Tottori2 PEDV strain belonged to a cluster including the reference PEDV strains and showed the closest genetic relationship to the US PEDV strain TC-PC177 (97.89% identity at the nucleotide sequence level) 2014 A unique case of PED, associated with no mortality rates among piglets, was observed in Tottori Prefecture Full-length genome analysis -The strain had 99.73-99.87%, 99.64-99.69% and 98.90-99.45% nt identities with those of North American Clades I and II and US S INDEL PEDV strains used in the phylogenetic analysis, respectively.

The complete genomes of the Japanese PEDV strains were almost identical to those of the US and Korean PEDV strains within each clade (Clade I: 99.77-99.99%; Clade II: 98.65-99.96%) S gene -The 38 PEDV strains clustered into two major clades, the North American (NA) type (n = 34), and the INDEL type (n = 4), each of which included the recent US and/or Korean PEDV strains. The 4 INDEL PEDV strains from Japan shared 99.76-99.95% nt sequence identity with each other, and shared 96.55-98.24% nt sequence identity with the 34 NA PEDV strains from Japan, respectively. These findings indicated that the 38 PEDV strains from Japan were more closely related to the global PEDV strains from the US and Korea than to the classical PEDV strains of 2,634 faecal and intestinal samples were collected from pigs exhibiting diarrhoea from 569 swine farms S gene complete sequence -The complete S gene sequence MF3809 showed a high (93.3-98.5% nt, 92.0-98.0% aa) sequence identity to all known PEDV strains for which full-length S gene sequences were available in GenBank, except that MF3809 has the large deletion in its S gene. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that MF3809 belonged to a cluster containing a PEDV reference strain, not a cluster that included any other coronaviruses, and showed the closest genetic relationship with PEDV strains from South Korea in 2009 M gene -The entire M gene of MF3809 had 96.6-100% nt (96.0-100% aa) sequence identity to all known PEDV strains available in GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis showed that MF3809 belonged to a cluster containing PEDV reference strain and showed the closest genetic relationship of 27 samples of diarrhoea and intestinal tissue from piglets were collected from farms in Korea The full S gene sequences of a total of 27 PEDV strains and 48 reference strains were compared. Based on the phylogenetic trees the Korean strains could be divided into two groups (G1 and G2) at the nt and aa levels. Vaccine strains, reference strains, and several of the Korean and Chinese strains were found to belong to G1, whereas all Korean field strains clustered together within G2. Interestingly, three strains (KDGG13_2DJ, KDGG14_6IC, and KDGN13_295BG) inG2-2 were highly similar to the US strains that spread in 2013, with 99.2-99.8% and 98.8-99.7% identity at the nt and aa levelsamples were collected from pigs exhibiting PED-like symptoms Full-length genome analysis -Nucleotide identity of 96.6-99.7% with other complete PEDV genomes available in GenBank, with the highest nucleotide identity (99.7%) with a new variant US strain, OH851 (KJ399978) S gene sequences -Nucleotide sequencing analysis showed 99.8-99.9% nt identity to a new variant strain OH851 from the of nine intestinal samples were collected from nine 1-to 7-day-old dead piglets, which showed signs of watery diarrhoea and dehydration from three farms S gene sequences -Phylogenetic analysis revealed two major clusters. All new PEDVs isolated from Taiwan in this study belonged to the Group 1 (G1). They were very closely related to the US non-S INDEL(USA-Iowa 28-2013, USA-Kansas 29-2013, USA-Texas 39-2013) strains and the Canada PEI-023 strain (ranging from 99.7% to 99.8%);but relatively less related to other Asia strains inthe same group, including the China PEDV strains isolatedfrom the PED outbreaks during 2011-2012, and the Vietnam strains isolated from the PEDoutbreaks in 2013 (VN/JFP1013_1/2013, VN/VAP1113_1/2013 and VN/ KCHY-310113/2013, ranging from 96.9% to 97.1%) The S gene sequences of the TaiwanPEDV variants were separated from the Group 2 (G2) viruses, which comprised the European CV777-based vaccinestrain (lower identity to the CV777 and DR13 vaccine strains, ranging from 93.9% to 94.2%), Korean DR13 strain, the Taiwan and global historic strains, and the US S INDELs strains, such as USAIndiana128, USA-Ohio126 and USA-Iowa107 strains Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the Taiwan strains and the US non-S INDEL PEDV strains were the most closely related to China CH/ZMZDY/11 and CH/ZY/11 strains (99.2-99.3% nucleotide sequence identity) complete sequence -the NSP3 genes from three clinical samples of swine with PEDV infection were obtained and aligned with 34 NSP3 genes available in GenBank as of February 2014. The results suggested that the viruses from the 2014 PEDV epidemic in Taiwan were highly clustered with the viruses from the US within Genogroup 2 Comprehensive PEDV full-genome sequences collected from the US were obtained and the phylogenetic tree was further constructed based on the nsp3 gene including 74 and 3 PEDV sequences from the US and Taiwan, respectively.

Postpartum sows did not fail to produce milk, but those affected by PEDV had a reduced feed intake and associated reduced milk output.The case-fatality rate reached nearly 100%. The decision was made to euthanize piglets <10 days of age during a 3-week period from the start of the outbreak. The performance of the pig unit took 20 weeks to return to preoutbreak levels. During that time, a total of 30,000 piglets died, which equates to a loss of 6 weaned piglets per sow per year.Updated epidemiological data on PEDwww.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal Age of the animals Morbidity and description of clinical signs and/or pathological lesions Mortality and production losses Piglets Occurred in January of 2014 in a 500 sow farrow-to-finish herd. Diarrhoea and vomiting in piglets. Piglet morbidity was 100%. Small and large intestine were distended with watery yellow translucent content; intestinal serosae were congested; moderate to marked atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi; villus tip epithelium was columnar but vacuolated Weaned pigs Retrospective cohort study based on 18 eligible pairs of batches: control (before Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea-PED -detection) and infected (first batch after PED detection).

Several units in the same or other production flows reported signs and/or confirmation of the virus by RT-PCR. Forty-two percent mortality was observed in piglets in one of the farrowing units.In one of the production flows, Overall, mortality among neonatal piglets was close to 100% one of the production flows.
