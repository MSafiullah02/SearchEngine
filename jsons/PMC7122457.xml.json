One can marvel at the regularity of the surface envelope protein of flaviviruses and alphaviruses where the proteins outside of the membrane are organized with the icosahedral shell inside of the membrane. One can envy the high density of envelope proteins that decorate the surface of coronaviruses and influenza virus. While some retroviruses show-off a high density of their surface envelope protein (Env), for others inclusion of the Env protein almost seems like an afterthought, given the apparent low density of Env on the virus surface (Zhu et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2016). In the case of HIV-1, the Env protein appears on the surface of the cell and if not quickly incorporated into a budding virion it is cycled back off the surface (Rowell et al. 1995; Sauter et al. 1996), presumably to avoid marking the cell as infected, a biologic example of \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d",

            "text": "All retroviruses encode an Env protein, representing a primordial strategy for how at least some viral particles are able to fuse their membranes with the target cellular membrane. There are cellular proteins that can fuse membranes, for example the SNAREs, but the details of how they accomplish this are sufficiently different that it is hard to argue they are the origin of the viral envelope proteins like retroviruses use. Ironically it is easier to make the opposite claim. The cellular protein syncytin 1 is responsible for fusing cells to make a multicellular placenta in primates. Syncytin 1 is derived from an endogenous retrovirus whose env gene is now developmentally regulated. When expressed it fuses adjacent cells in the same way a viral membrane is fused to the cellular membrane; similar capture events appear to have happened in other eutherian mammals (Cornelis et al. 2013). The current lack of a true cellular protein that acts like the retroviral Env protein, and the fact that the retroviral Env protein functions in the same way as the influenza viral protein (and the surface protein of other distant viruses too), points to an early evolution of this type of membrane fusion capacity in enveloped viruses with this gene evolving with viruses as they generated different lineages. It is also likely that this gene has been passed among different viral lineages followed by distinctive evolution within the lineages to retain the basic fusion mechanism but with greatly varying sequence.",

            "text": "There are several universal points about this class of viral entry proteins (Fig. 1). First, they are type 1 transmembrane (TM) proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence that threads them into the endoplasmic reticulum and a stop-transfer sequence that stays in the membrane near the C terminus of the protein. This gives a luminal/outside N terminus of the protein and leaves the C terminus \u201cinside\u201d of the cell, which later becomes the inside of the virus particle when it buds from the cell taking some of the cellular membrane as its envelope. Second, there is an obligatory trimerization of the protein to stabilize its structure. Third, each subunit of the trimer is cleaved by a host protein (furin or furin-like) in the late Golgi compartment to create an extracellular component and a TM component, both of which are retained in the trimer complex and with each other. Fourth, the extracellular component (called SU for surface component in retrovirus nomenclature) of the cleaved protein is responsible for interacting with the host receptor(s), while the TM component exposes a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids (fusion peptide) at its new N terminus that is able to insert into the host membrane to facilitate fusion of host and viral membranes. There is a signal transduction event between the SU and TM components of the protein that occurs when the SU component binds its receptor thus defining the moment when fusion to the host cell must occur. There are diverse host cell receptors for viruses with this type of surface envelope protein, and the protein domains that bind the receptor and transduce the signal have lost any semblance of a common ancestor. And fifth, in contrast to the diversity of SU protein function the fusion mechanism is highly conserved, in function if not in sequence. Insertion of the TM N-terminal fusion peptide into the host cell membrane is linked to the formation of a proximal trimer of a heptad repeat. This is followed by a more distal heptad repeat that folds up on the N-terminal heptad repeat to form a hairpin. Both of these heptad repeats (hr) are in the extracellular domain of TM such that the N-terminal repeat (hr1) is adjacent to the fusion peptide inserted into the host membrane and the C-terminal heptad repeat (hr2) is adjacent to the viral membrane-spanning portion of TM; the juxtaposition of the heptad repeats in the hairpin brings the two membranes together to promote fusion, bringing the inside of the virus particle into the inside of the target host cell.\n",

            "text": "There are several other curious points to mention about viruses that use this type of viral entry protein. First, the somewhat loose relationship between the TM viral envelope protein and the viral capsid inside of the viral envelope allows other proteins to be incorporated as TM proteins into the virus particle. Cellular proteins can be incorporated and there is an ongoing interest as to whether such proteins can alter the biology of the virus particle. Second, other viral proteins can be incorporated into the virus envelope which now gives the virus a host range specificity not encoded in its own genome, a phenomenon known as pseudotyping. Third, the virus-producing cell still expresses the cellular receptor. Since the virus does not what its envelope proteins interacting with the host cell receptor on a cell that is already infected, viruses use a variety of strategies of lowering the amount of receptor on the surface of the infected cell and regulating the fusogenicity of the envelope protein until the virus particle has budded. The overall effect of either down-regulating the receptor or tying up the receptor with newly synthesized Env protein prevents the infected cell from getting super-infected (usually), a phenomenon known as interference.",

In a retrospective published by Harry Rubin in 2011, he reviewed the role new assays played in developing an understanding of the viruses, not just the disease (Rubin 2011). In 1938 Keogh showed that (tumor-like) lesions could be produced on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of a chicken egg providing a semi-quantitative alternative to titering virus in chickens. It took another 20 years until Prince discovered that the high number of false negatives (i.e., eggs that gave no lesions) was a genetic trait of the chicken strains used, defining a sensitive and resistant allele for the virus used, and the first measure of the viral receptor. It was also around this time that Howard Temin, then a graduate student collaborating with Harry Rubin, perfected the focus-forming assay with an agar overlay to allow titration of the transforming activity of RSV. Each egg could be turned into multiple plates of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and read much easier than counting lesions on CAM.",

A subset of embryos that should have given cells that were susceptible to transformation by RSV were in fact resistant, defining a resistance-inducing factor (RIF). For a number of years avian leukosis viruses had been studied for their natural infection of chickens, and it turned out that the RIF was the result of the occasional embryo that was already infected with an ALV. This revealed the phenomenon of interference, the mechanism being that when a cell is already expressing a viral envelope protein it removes or engages its normal receptor precluding infection with a new virus with the same receptor specificity.",

            "text": "It had been 50 years of research and experimental passaging of Rous sarcoma virus by this time so it should not be surprising that different virus stocks had acquired different properties and even different passenger viruses. RSV is unique in that it can be propagated as a replication competent virus, in contrast to most other acutely transforming retroviruses that carry deletion of part of the viral genome with the acquisition of the cellular oncogene. But RSV will delete the v-src gene to give rise to a non-acutely transforming, replication competent Rous-associated virus (RAV), again essentially a standard ALV. However, the isolation of the first RAV (RAV-1) with its associated interference properties was followed by the isolation of a second RAV (RAV-2) with distinct interference properties. The clear implication was that these two viruses used different host receptors. Furthermore, the isolation of defective forms of the transforming virus component (defective for replication) allowed rescue of the transforming genome with any ALV helper virus, with the transforming component now having the cell infectivity properties of the helper virus (i.e., a pseudotype). The combination of cell susceptibility to infection and transformation, and the ability to test viruses for the use of the same or different receptors through interference led to the identification of virus subgroups, specifically subgroups A, B, C, D, and E (with J coming later). Conversely it was possible to identify the genetic loci for susceptibility in chickens, the presumed receptors which were named tva, tvb, and tvc (with tvb serving a receptor for subgroups D and E ALV). Thus great strides in the genetics of the virus and the host were accomplished using the focus-forming assay. These insights into the biology of the virus and the host set the stage for the coming tools of cloning and sequencing.",

Advances in growing and purifying the virus, and in protein analysis allowed for the identification of proteins associated with the virus particle, and presumably encoded by the viral genome. In the early 1970s a small group of investigators, including Peter Vogt, had characterized virion proteins for RSV, including virion-associated glycoproteins (Duesberg et al. 1970; Robinson et al. 1970). By 1971 the combination of EM, virus purification, radioactive labeling of proteins, and protease treatment was used to show that it was the virion glycoprotein that was on the exterior of the viral envelope (Rifkin and Compans 1971). With viral genetics providing recombinants with altered host range it became possible to map the location of the glycoprotein within the viral genome using the pre-sequencing tool of assessing patterns of RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides displayed using 2D electrophoresis, placing the env gene at the 3\u2032 end of the ALV genome (Joho et al. 1975; Coffin and Billiter 1976; Wang et al. 1976).",

With guidelines in place a new era of biology began. Virologists had to become at least mediocre bacteriologists capable of growing phage and plasmids and isolating biological clones. Those up to the task were rewarded with a new view of genes and genomes. With the availability of unlimited amounts of cloned DNA, sequencing tools quickly followed and gene and inferred protein sequences were revealed. Since DNA is relatively homogeneous in its chemical properties, in contrast to its information properties, virtually anything could be cloned with the order determined by the investigator\u2019s interest. For those interested in viruses with RNA genomes the challenge was greater, while for retrovirologists most went after the DNA form of the viral genome. However, in an early tour de force, virtually the entire RSV genome was sequenced as cDNA products that were made using random primers, purified reverse transcriptase, and viral genomic RNA (Schwartz et al. 1983). The authors noted in their 1983 paper that \u201cat the time this project was initiated, molecular cloning of RSV was prohibited.\u201d The placement of the env gene, upstream of the v-src gene, was proven by comparing the amino-terminal protein sequences of the SU (gp85) and TM (gp37) Env protein subunits and placing them on the nucleotide sequence (Hunter et al. 1983).

For evolutionary differences there are two considerations: first is a relatively uninteresting evolutionary drift that occurs with evolutionary distance; more interesting are the sequences that rapidly evolve due to strong selective pressure where the differences can be linked to changes in biological function. Thus the second and third sequences reported, for subgroup B and E env genes, revealed conserved and variable regions that could only be interpreted as the protein framework and two regions of variability as determinants of receptor specificity, named host range 1 and 2 or hr 1 and 2 (Dorner et al. 1985).

Next the receptor for subgroup B and D viruses was cloned and recognized as a member of the TNFR protein family (Brojatsch et al. 1996), then the receptor for subgroup E was identified as another member of the TNFR family (Adkins et al. 2001), and finally the subgroup C receptor was identified as a member of the butyrophilin protein family (Elleder et al. 2005). The lesson learned is that viruses pick out receptors using a logic that as yet escapes us. The polymorphisms in the receptor/susceptibility loci, in part expanded in the population by breeding but still from naturally existing alleles, suggests selection against having functional receptors by the host. This is analogous to the presence of xenotropic MLV endogenous viruses, i.e., an endogenous virus that can not infect its host (or that the host lost the functional receptor after the endogenous provirus was fixed). Since evolution is not functionally blind, it must be the case that there is a primary receptor and at least a low level of interaction with other surface proteins, as different from each other as they are, to allow the evolution of different subgroups with different receptor specificities. The ultimate \u201creceptor switch\u201d then provides the strong selective pressure for rapid sequence change in the hr1 and hr2 regions.",

Thus we should not be surprised that just as we were getting comfortable with the biology of ALV, and ways to avoid it in chicken flocks, a new subgroup appeared, subgroup J. As reviewed in Payne and Nair (2012) a new pathogenic subgroup of ALV was identified in the late 1980s, subsequently shown to be a recombinant between ALV and the env gene of an endogenous retroviral allele. The receptor for this virus was cloned and shown to be a Na+/H+ exchanger type 1 protein (Chai and Bates 2006), thus adding to the seemingly non sequitur list of cellular proteins capable of serving as receptors.",

That means that the other forms must evolve from the R5 T cell-tropic form (Fig. 2). With the discovery of coreceptors it was possible to make the link with the CXCR4-using version of HIV-1 as appearing late in infection (Connor et al. 1997; Brumme et al. 2005; Moyle et al. 2005). As noted above for the evolution of different subgroups of ALV (probably on a much longer time scale), the R5 T cell-tropic version of HIV-1 must interact at least a little bit with CXCR4 to allow that evolutionary pathway to occur. At the extreme, the adaptation is so complete that the virus losses the ability to interact with CCR5, however most viruses never get that far in their evolution so the typical virus seen is termed dual-tropic, meaning it can use both CXCR4 and CCR5. We have observed that these dual-tropic viruses have a reduced affinity for CCR5, as measured by increased sensitivity to a CCR5 antagonist, suggesting that the dual-tropic viruses are more X4 than R5 (M. Bednar and R.S., in preparation). We have also observed that X4 viruses require a high density of CD4 for efficient entry, retaining their X4 T cell-tropic moniker. Since X4 viruses evolve late in disease we can speculate that either they require an immunodeficient host to evolve or that they evolve when the preferred target cells, CD4+ CCR5+ T cells, become limiting. One theory is that CD4+ CXCR4+ naive T cells support the replication of X4 viruses (Ribeiro et al. 2006).\n",

These viruses evolve in a T cell-poor environment, especially in the CNS (Sturdevant et al. 2015). In addition to their ability to efficiently enter cells with a low density of CD4 there is a tightly linked phenotype of increased sensitivity to neutralization by soluble CD4 (Arrildt et al. 2015).

The strongest selective pressure in cell culture is likely to occur on the viral entry phenotype. There is no wrong cell to infect given that the culture is largely homogeneous, so viral replication in cell culture becomes a race to see who can enter cells most quickly.

For most viruses this would lead to insertion of the fusion peptide followed by membrane fusion. However, for HIV-1 there is an extra step. The first conformational change is to create and expose the CCR5 binding site. Binding to CCR5 then triggers insertion of the fusion peptide, formation of the six helix bundle, and membrane fusion between the host and viral membranes. Thus the HIV-1 Env protein trimer must transition through a lot of conformational space to carry out its job. When examining the antibodies from people infected with HIV-1 there seem to be abundant antibodies to epitopes that are created after binding to CD4. This is likely the selective pressure that keeps the trimer in a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation where these epitopes are either covered or not yet even formed. The transient exposure of these epitopes after CD4 engagement leaves too little space at the surface of the cell for these antibodies to be effective (Labrijn et al. 2003).

The important distinction to make is that tissue culture adaptation selects for an open conformation while macrophage tropism does not. There do seem to be some structural changes in the Env protein associated with macrophage tropism, but these do not go as far as representing the tissue culture-adapted open conformation (Arrildt et al. 2015). This is an important distinction to make because these two forms appear to share the feature of being able to use CD4 at a low density. We would predict that the pathway to low CD4 use in the context of tissue culture adaptation is distinct from the more relevant pathway that the virus uses in vivo to become macrophage-tropic. In developing a relevant understanding of macrophage tropism it will be important to rigorously avoid confounding information that comes from tissue culture-adapted viruses.",

Alternatively, it can evolve to use a low density of CD4 to enter cells such as macrophages, which have a density of CD4 about 25-fold lower than that found on T cells. Also in vivo, these viruses are found in a closed conformation, i.e., resistant to neutralization, especially to antibodies targeting the epitopes exposed after binding CD4. In cell culture the virus follows another evolutionary pathway in which an open conformation is generated allowing the use of a low density of CD4 for entry.
