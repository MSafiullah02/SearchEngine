At the same time, the pandemic has stimulated enormous amount of research by scientists across various disciplines, seeking to study the phenomenon itself, its epidemiological characteristics and ways to confront its consequences. Information Technology, and particularly Data Science, drive innovation in all related to Covid-19 biomedical fields. Acknowledging that software developers routinely resort to open 'question & answer' communities like Stack Overflow to seek advice on solving technical issues, we have performed an empirical study to investigate the extent, evolution and characteristics of Covid-19 related posts. In particular, through the study of 464 Stack Overflow questions posted mainly in February and March 2020 and leveraging the power of text mining, we attempt to shed light into the interest of developers in Covid-19 related topics and the most popular technological problems for which the users seek information. The findings reveal that indeed this global crisis sparked off an intense and increasing activity in Stack Overflow with most post topics reflecting a strong interest on the analysis of Covid-19 data, primarily using Python technologies.",

Besides the profound impact in health care, the crisis has expanded to all other aspects of everyday life, including social relations and economic activities. A unique characteristic of the crisis is its rapid evolvement, i.e. the situation changes from day to day. Due to the growing number of infection epicenters, governments have put emphasis on tight restrictive measures that prohibit access to work, travels, meetings, etc. Such strategies essentially at first encouraged and then necessitated distance work, education, entertainment and social activities. These measures soon led to increased and massive demand of technological support, especially regarding communications, awareness, adaptation of e-government and e-shopping systems, etc.",

For example, data science methodologies (e.g. data storing and management) are particularly important for epidemiologists and for all those taking decisions based on the distribution and the mortality rates of the disease.

The goal is to find, retrieve and study SO posts that are related to Covid-19 so as to understand why and for which topics developers are interested and how these topics are associated. Also, our study aims to investigate the evolution of posts in a time frame where the crisis is continuously escalating. We should note that with the term 'developers' we do not necessarily assume that users posting on SO are software professionals. Especially with respect to Covid-19, we consider it highly possible that scientists from various domains (e.g. medical sciences, biostatistics, public health scientists, etc.) are pursuing research that relies on scientific software 1 [1] mainly targeting collection, analysis, visualization and interpretation of Covid-19 related data.",

Hence, we do not take into consideration posts, where the topic of discussion concerns for example the use of collaboration technologies that are extensively used by organizations, educational institutions etc. in order to facilitate their operational activities during the coronavirus lockdown. In order to better illustrate our main objective, we provide a representative example of what we are referring to as a coronavirus-related post ( Figure 1 ). The title of the post summarizes that the main topic of the question being asked by the user is to extract a dataset of Covid-19 cases comprising information regarding confirmed cases, country of interest, deaths etc. as it is concluded by the inspection of the code snippet of the post. Even though we cannot be absolutely certain regarding the poster's intentions, the question is certainly associated to technological challenges emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic. Except for the title and the body of the question, the four tags of this specific post (\"python\", \"api\", \"web-scrapping\" and \"beautifulsoup\") directly point to the context of the discussed topic, which, in this case, is the broad scientific domain of data science.",

Since our main objective is the investigation of what developers are asking about coronavirus-related topics, we must note that the data collection is restricted only to question posts. The search string that was used was quite broad, comprising synonyms of coronavirus (\"coronavirus\" OR \"covid*\" OR \"corona-virus\") to retrieve the entire set of relevant questions posted until the 1 st of April, which was the final date of collection. The application of the search string on the SO search engine returned 601 candidate posts in the form of semi-structured web documents. Document collection was achieved by using a web scraper built in Python based on the Selenium package 2 . The scraper retrieved all questions on each page and iterated each question individually to collect additional features not found on the question's display on the results page. 2 selenium.

LDA [15] is a well-known probabilistic model for topic extraction in a collection of documents that has been extensively used in many experimental studies for topic modeling on textual content of SO posts [9] . The main idea behind LDA is that documents are represented as probability distributions over latent topics, where each topic is represented by a distribution of words [15] . Thus, LDA unveils the hidden topics by taking into consideration the patterns of the words that tend to co-occur frequently in the set of documents of the corpus. The selection of the number of topics is based on experimentation with different values of , since it is a user-defined parameter [8] and there is not an optimum value for all experimental setups [14] . Generally, a high value of K results to the identification of a detailed collection of topics, whereas smaller values of K result to more general collection of topics [6, 16] .",

In order to gain better insights about the characteristics of the observed phenomenon, we initially performed statistical analysis on the associated features that can be found in each post. Figure 4a presents the distribution of the number of received answers for the set of posts indicating that more than 60% of the posts has already been responded by at least one user (mean value = 0.87, standard deviation = 0.88, median = 1). Considering that we have tracked Covid-19 related posts for a two-month period, it is rather reasonable that most posts have received a limited number of answers. Due to the observed growing interest on coronavirus-related, there is a need to examine, whether these questions are posted by different users or whether, there is only a specific proportion of users that are interested in. To this regard, we evaluate the percentage of unique users who posted a question related to a coronavirus issue. The percentage of unique users (# of different users posted one question divided by the # of posts) was 79.09% signifying a broad awareness of the community. The analysis on the occurrences of SO tags showed that most users (56.46%) defined from two up to three tags (Figure 4b ).

This is reasonable but also proves the quick responsiveness of the scientific software community against global phenomena and emerging topics and the pressing needs for multiple representations of data. It is also interesting that a periodicity in the downward dents in the number of posts can be observed: these drops seem to coincide with the end of the corresponding weeks, as they mostly occur on Fridays and Saturdays. Further investigation can reveal whether the observed trend in the number of posts will match the Covid-19 pandemic for the upcoming months.",

This is of course a consequence of the limited period in which the analysis of SO posts has been carried out, but it could also imply that the rapid developments did not allow the forming of mature research communities. In other words, as in any other emerging crises or trends, the first researchers who attempt to analyze and interpret the phenomenon are working independently and loosely interact with each other.",

Considering that all posts are related to Covid-19, we can postulate that developers of scientific software from various domains focus on Data Science techniques to analyze the tremendous dimensions of the coronavirus outbreak. Thus, knowledge sharing communities such as SO prove useful not only for solving everyday technical challenges faced by software professionals but also as a means of collaboration and essential knowledge dissemination in cases of emergencies or global crises. It should also be praised that developers are willing to share the knowledge they hold to assist fellow researchers underlining the benefits of open source projects and communities.",

Developers experiment with collecting data mostly through web-scraping and in most of the cases build python, r, or javascript applications to visualize aspects of the phenomenon. The most frequent words associated with each topic essentially reflect the early stages of programming in a new environment where \"how-to\" questions come first and fixing errors right after. The pattern of words possibly implies that beyond the experienced developers, researchers with less experience in programming have also been attracted by the gigantic dimensions of the crisis and have attempted to write their own applications.",

The search strings were quite broad, since we only included general terms related to Covid-19, so as to identify a high proportion of relevant posts but there is always the risk of omitting questions, in which a different terminology for the pandemic might have been used. In addition, we have removed non-relevant posts, containing the keywords of the search string but addressing a problem that is associated to a general topic resulting from the coronavirus lockdown (e.g. issues related to the utilization of collaborative technologies). To mitigate bias from this action, filtering was performed by the first and the second author independently and by discussing conflicts.

Additionally, we have to note the limited timeframe of the collection phase resulting to the retrieval of a specific number of posts, which is certainly smaller compared to other studies investigating other more general topics. However, we have to take into consideration that Covid-19 pandemic is an unexpected and emerging situation with detrimental effects to any aspect of human activity and for this reason, it triggers the adoption of a variety of necessitated strategies and actions to understand and mitigate the consequences of this phenomenon, even in their infantile form. Finally, the extraction of topics of discussion was based on the analysis conducted on the titles of posts. Despite the fact that the title of a question is expected to provide a general overview of the problem being asked, the inclusion of the corpus found in the body may improve the inferential process, even if it may also introduce some noise.",
