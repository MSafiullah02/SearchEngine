I specifically consider possible nonlinearity of this association by suggesting a bipartite theory that integrates the \u201cdisplacement hypothesis\u201d (Gentile, 2011) with the \u201cimprinting through repeated exposure\u201d hypothesis (Anderson et al., 2010). This bipartite theory suggests that \u201clight\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d gaming can be a positive force that reduces gun-carrying behaviors (compared to not playing video games). However, at high levels of video gaming time, the stronger imprinting of aggressive behaviors becomes feasible, and can overshadow the positive displacement effect. Combined, these hypotheses imply a U-shaped association between video gaming time and carrying guns to schools (see Fig. 1\n).",

The first dataset includes 2012\u20132014 data (n = 24,779) and the second includes 2015\u20132017 data (n = 26,543). These data were selected for several reasons. First, I focused on adolescents given their tendency to engage in risky behaviors, including gun-related behaviors (Klein et al., 1993); this behooves researchers and policymakers to find ways to reduce them. Second, as mentioned above, gun culture and accessibility in the US make gun-carrying to school easier to implement compared to in other countries (Ybarra, Huesmann, Korchmaros, & Reisner, 2014). Lastly, for convenience reasons, the employed datasets include a large sample of US adolescents that have reported both video gaming and gun-carrying behaviors.",

            "text": "I first note that the association between videogames and aggression is typically explained via the general aggression model (Bushman & Anderson, 2002; DeWall et al., 2011). This model suggests that aggressive behaviors are triggered in social encounters based on repeated person-environment interactions that create knowledge structures (or scripts), which include aggression as a desirable, normal, and acceptable response to threats in the environment. When such scripts are established, people can develop hostile attribution bias, which leads them to assess ambiguous social situations as much more threatening than they really are, and respond to them with aggression (Crick & Dodge, 1996). Thus, when aggression scripts are imprinted in individuals, individuals tend to accentuate threats in the environment and act accordingly (Dill, Anderson, Anderson, & Deuser, 1997). Applied here, it means that repeated exposure to guns, gun use, and violence, can normalize such objects and behaviors in adolescents\u2019 minds and make them seem like natural and even necessary. At the heart of this association is the assumption that most videogames include violent features, which are the basis for imprinting violent behaviors. I test this assertion in a preliminary study of 99 11th grade US high school students (66 male, 33 female) who play videogames. Results (see Supplemental Materials B) show that even though games vary by audience rating, most popular games contain blood, violence, shooting, and weapons. Thus, they have the potential to imprint violent behaviors, including gun-related behaviors.",

While a single exposure is sufficient for creating short term effects on immediate aggressive cognitions and behaviors (Bushman & Anderson, 2002), it takes frequent and prolonged repetition to create significant relatively stable changes in a person's aggressive personality, as manifested in more aggressive behavioral schemata (Anderson et al., 2017). This is consistent with key ideas of attitude and behavior change models (Ajzen, 2001; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011), according to which changes require prolonged and persistence exposure to change instigators. When video gaming time is low, possible aggressive cues in games may not suffice for creating significant changes in aggression (gun-related in our case) schemata (Lemmens, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2011). Thus, I hypothesize that (H1) only when video gaming time is sufficiently high (to be empirically defined later), there is a positive association between video gaming time and bringing guns to school.",

            "text": "To supplement this perspective, I build on the displacement hypothesis. It suggests that when there are physical, spatial, or temporal constraints that do not afford simultaneous execution of activities, one activity may be displaced by another, more appealing, or advantageous activity (Gabor, 1981). For example, when gun availability is low, other means of suicide displace them (Carrington & Moyer, 1994). In the case of video gaming, research often built on the displacement hypothesis to suggest that time spent on video gaming displaces and detracts from other important activities (Gentile, 2011), such as school work (Sharif & Sargent, 2006) and physical activity (Biddle, Gorely, Marshall, Murdey, & Cameron, 2004) (dubbed here negative displacement). Nevertheless, video gaming can also serve as a positive displacement by keeping adolescents occupied. This activity prevents them from having the motivation and/or opportunity to hang out on the streets and indirectly, have a need, motivation to acquire or carry, and access to guns. There is some evidence for such positive displacement with regards to illicit substances; \u201clight\u201d gamers use illicit substances less frequently compared to non-gamers and compared to \u201cheavy\u201d gamers (Turel & Bechara, 2019).",

This positive displacement means that video games can serve as a healthy substitute to unsupervised after-school time (that can give rise to motivation and opportunity to access guns), without much influence of imprinting forces. Videogames, at this level, can displace gun behaviors indirectly. Specifically, they can alleviate precondition factors for gun carrying to school (e.g., hanging out with people who sell and/or play with guns, hanging out and feeling threatened on the streets, socializing with the wrong people after school). This level of video gaming can also represent \u201cvoluntary incapacitation,\u201d a term describing how people selectively choose an activity that prevents them from engaging in problematic behaviors (Dahl & DellaVigna, 2009). Integrating these views, I hypothesize that (H2) as people transition from not playing video games to low video gaming time, there is a negative association between video gaming time and bringing guns to school.",

The integration of these forces suggests that video gaming contributes to declining gun-carrying behaviors (consistent with the positive displacement hypothesis) until an inflection point, where the imprinting hypothesis overshadows the displacement effect, and the association between video gaming and bringing guns to school becomes positive.

Responses ranged from 1 = none to 9 = \u226540 h. To avoid relying on the artificial equal distances between scale points, they were converted into estimated hours per day. Range values (e.g., 6\u20139 h) were re-coded as the middle point (i.e., 7.5 h in the example), and the result was divided by seven to convert from weekly to daily time (Bradbury, Turel, & Morrison, 2019). Squared values were calculated to model the hypothesized quadratic association. The dependent variable (frequency of bringing a gun to school) was captured in a different part of the survey by asking adolescents to report the number of days during the last four weeks on which they brought a gun to school. Responses ranged from 1 = none to 6 = \u226510 days. For proper scaling, similar conversions to those applied to the independent variable were employed here. For example, the value \u201c3\u20135 days\u201d was recoded as 4 days. For a supplementary analysis focusing on video gaming association with the odds of bringing guns to schools, a dummy variable was created (Turel, 2020), such that 0 represented not bringing a gun to school over the last 4 weeks and 1 described bringing a gun to school in the previous 4 weeks, at least once.",

Year of administration was included to account for trends in gun violence prevalence in the US (Frazer et al., 2018). Sex was included because the sexes differ in both video gaming patterns and choices (Lucas & Sherry, 2004) and weapon-related behaviors (DuRant, Krowchuk, Kreiter, Sinal, & Woods, 1999). Grade was included as a proxy for age, because assaults with weapons and injuries from such assaults increase from the age of 2 to the age of 17 (Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, & Hamby, 2009). The family environment and socioeconomic status were indirectly captured with parent education (Johnson, Cohen, Smailes; Kasen, & Brook, 2002). Lastly, TV time is another activity that can potentially displace violent behaviors at low levels but may be less likely to imprint violent behaviors at high levels (Markey, Markey, & French, 2015; Swing, Gentile, Anderson, & Walsh, 2010). I hence control for it and its squared value.",

All models were estimated with bootstrapping with 1000 re-samples for generating bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for estimates. This was done to avoid distributional assumptions, for better assessing estimate robustness (Mooney & Duval, 1993), and for allowing the comparison of regression coefficients. I performed three analyses. First, a preliminary examination of the hypothesized U-shaped association was performed by plotting the 95% confidence intervals for the frequency of bringing guns to school at different levels of daily video gaming time. Non-overlapping confidence intervals or distances from upper/lower bound to the estimate point that have <50% overlap were deemed indicative of significant differences at least at the p < 0.05 level (Cumming, 2009). Second, I tested the hypotheses directly with hierarchical regression models (Turel & Gil-Or, 2019), where the first block included control variables, the second added video gaming time, and the third added squared video gaming time. This approach allows testing nonlinear associations after accounting for control variables, and for examining the added contribution of predictors. Last, I supplemented the testing of the hypotheses and expanded the regression model interpretation with a logistic regression model that focused on the associations between the predictors and the odds of bringing a gun to school. The dependent variable in this case was binary (brought a gun to school or not), which required the use of logistic regression.",

The literature on the positive effects of video games on adolescents typically focused on developmental and brain-change benefits (Bavelier, Green, Pouget, & Schrater, 2012; Dye, Green, & Bavelier, 2009; Green & Bavelier, 2003, 2007). The literature on negative effects of video games on adolescents typically used the displacement hypothesis for suggesting that video gaming time detracts from the time devoted to other life domains (Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, 2004), or used experiments to demonstrate that playing violent video games can impair anger recognition, increase self-perceived fighting ability and reduce perceptions regarding the toughness of opponents (Denson et al., 2019). The literature has also been more heavily slanted toward the adverse effects of video games (Ferguson, 2015). We show here that indeed video game use can be associated with undesirable adolescent behaviors, which is consistent with prior research (Anderson et al., 2008, 2010). However, we also show that at relatively low-medium levels of video gaming time, video games can actually have positive/protective effects on adolescents in terms of gun-related behaviors. Future research can examine the positive displacement hypothesis and the proposed bipartite perspective with other technologies.",

            "text": "The findings suggest that low levels of video gaming may be encouraged by families and health professionals, especially for at-risk youth, as such activities can displace and reduce the potential for problematic behaviors. At the same time, I note that video gaming at higher levels should not necessarily be prevented (Shin & Huh, 2011), especially during unsucal times, such as epideomisc like COVID-19. Heavy use (presumably especially of violent games), however, may be considered a risk factor for gun-related behaviors (but not necessarily a strong predictor of such behaviors), especially for males. When such conditions exist, parents, teachers, and health professionals may want to monitor the situation more closely. Moreover, the findings suggest that legislators and governments should not necessarily try to restrict video gaming time or adolescent access to even violent video games (see one attempt described in Clements, 2012) because (1) general video gaming associations with gun-related behaviors are small, and (2) at low levels of general gaming time such activities can be useful and shelter adolescents from other, undesirable behaviors (Turel & Bechara, 2019). Similarly, the findings suggest that video game developers should be more mindful regarding possible adverse effects of gaming, but only after a certain threshold. Hence, suggestions made in prior research to include warning or game-lock mechanisms (Xu, Turel, & Yuan, 2012) can be efficacious and should take into account the transition point between the dominance of the displacement and imprinting forces. These implications, though, merit much more research given the observed small associations, the focus on general gaming time and not on violent games only, and the preliminary and correlational nature of our findings.",

            "text": "Ultimately, even though this study relied on two large datasets, findings of this study should be treated as preliminary, because our data were cross-sectional, restricted in scope (I was constrained by available national survey items, such as general gaming time) and self-reported, and focused on one specific problematic behavior. While the replication of the model in two datasets increase confidence in the bipartite theory, future longitudinal designs, with foci on a broader set of aggressive and/or problematic behaviors, separating violent and nonviolent games, and using objective data (e.g., video gaming logs), can be used for enriching and extending our findings and their generalizability. It would also be interesting to consider the effect of platforms in which shooting is more naturally simulated (e.g., Kinect) on gun-related behaviors in future research. In addition, I focused only on US adolescents (13\u201316 years old). Generalizability to other countries with different gun cultures and accessibility, as well as with varying responses to videogames and video gaming narratives (Ochoa et al., 2006; Welsh, 2016) should be established with data from additional countries. Moreover, the proposed model explained a small proportion of the variance in the target behavior. While this is understandable given the sparse and complex nature of the outcome variable (Glenn & Shelton, 1983; O'grady, 1982), and does not detract from the importance of studying such significant but small associations (Abelson, 1985), future research can include a broader range of predictors of gun-related behaviors. In addition, our study was constrained by available data to focus on all games and consequently did not account for the specific games and/or types of games adolescents play. Although I show that the most popular games among adolescents include many violent features, it would be interesting to consider if our model improves when the focus is only on violent games and/or level of violence in games is directly included in the model. The model can also be extended to focus on competition within games, frustration, and not just violence, as competition and frustration are more potent drivers of aggressive affect than violence itself (Dowsett & Jackson, 2019). This also means that the recommendations regarding desirable and risky gaming time should be taken with caution, and be fine-tuned to account for the type of games adolescents play an special cirumstances (like COVID-19).",

This study presents a more balanced view through a theory that accounts for both positive and negative associations between videogames and problematic adolescent behaviors. The findings provide initial support to the idea that low levels of general video gaming can be protective. In contrast, higher levels of general video gaming time can be a small risk factor for gun-related behaviors. These findings show that the moral panic over video games in general, many of which include aggressive elements, is largely unsubstantiated, but also that there may be some kernel of truth in attributing some (small) blame to video games, but only at very high levels of use. I call for further testing our theory and for adjusting public statements portraying video games as primarily negative.",
