All patients underwent a baseline preoperative assessment 1 to 2 weeks before surgery. Postoperatively, all patients were treated using a standardized inpatient protocol, following either a primary total hip or knee care pathway. Patients undergoing TKA were permitted to be full weight bearing and participated in a progressive program of range of motion, strengthening exercises, and functional training. Patients after THA were educated about postoperative movement restrictions, and mobility and strengthening exercises were initiated. In this sample, most of the patients had weight-bearing restrictions.",

Because the main goals of arthroplasty are to decrease pain and improve function, similar to other research 2, 3, 19, only the pain (5 items) and physical function subscales (17 items) of the WOMAC were profiled. The WOMAC is considered one of the leading self-report measures of outcome in the arthroplasty population, and numerous studies have examined its reliability, validity, and responsiveness. McConnell et al [20] have provided an excellent summary of this work. In the current study, patients completed the full-length Likert scaled version of the WOMAC (LK 3.1). Each subscale is rated on a scale of 0 to 4 with a maximum score of 20 on the pain subscale and 68 on the physical function subscale with higher scores representing more pain and worse function. The total scores from each of the pain and physical function subscales were used in the analyses.",

Recognizing that the rate of improvement would eventually slow the model also includes the square of time as a predictor to estimate the change in the growth rate for each week after 1 week.
