            "text": "The pharmaceutical industry has an ongoing interest in developing technologies for therapeutic gene suppression. Previous efforts focused on sequence-specific RNA knockdown technologies such as antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes. While some success has been achieved with these drug platforms [1], technical issues regarding delivery, stability, off-target effects, and effective target sequence selection have slowed the development of efficacious clinical drugs. In recent years, however, we have witnessed the discovery of a new mechanism of gene regulation called RNA interference (RNAi), which has revitalized interest in the clinical development of nucleic acid-based gene inhibition approaches. This review focuses on the potential therapeutic use of RNAi. After a brief introduction to RNAi, we discuss the theoretical advantages of RNAi-based therapeutics over previous technologies and then temper that optimism with a discussion of the challenges involved in developing RNAi for clinical use. Finally, we review proof-of principle experiments that have demonstrated the clinical potential of RNAi, highlighting some of the in vivo successes that provide the preclinical justification for the continued development of RNAi-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "RNAi is a naturally occurring biological process that is highly conserved among multicellular organisms diverse as plants, worms, yeast, and humans. It refers to a two-part intracellular pathway in which precursor double-stranded RNA molecules present in the cell are first processed by the dicer endonuclease into short 21-23 nucleotide fragments containing 2 nucleotide single-stranded 3\u2032 overhangs on each strand. These effector RNAs, called short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), then become incorporated into an RNA-inducing silencing protein complex (RISC) in which one strand of the unwound siRNA acts as a guide sequence to target the cleavage of homologous RNAs [2], [3], [4]. In plants, RNAi plays a role in cellular defense, protecting the cell from inappropriate expression of repetitive sequences, transposable elements, and virus infections (reviewed in [5]). In addition to evidence that similar defense functions may still be active in mammalian cells [6], [7], an increasing number of short RNA molecules are being found encoded in the mammalian genome. These endogenous RNAs, or microRNAs (miRNAs), are also processed by dicer into siRNA effectors, and are proving to regulate the expression of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (reviewed in [8], [9], [10]). Importantly, when siRNA molecules are chemically synthesized and exogenously introduced into mammalian cells, they become incorporated into the cellular RISC complex and mediate the degradation of RNAs to which they are homologous [2], [3], [4].",

Particularly in the fields of oncology and genetic neurological disorders where disease is often caused by a dominant mutation in a single allele, this would offer the opportunity to selectively inhibit expression of only the defective gene. However, being able to identify an effective target sequence in which a single polymorphism can be distinguished is not trivial. Impressively, although our knowledge of optimal siRNA target selection is still limited, RNAi activity is specific enough that allele-specific silencing has already been demonstrated for several prominent cancer and neurological targets [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].",

This is also empirically evident by the remarkable speed at which RNAi techniques have been implemented in scientific research, and the number of successful RNAi-based experiments already published. It is speculated that this advantage is derived from the fact that RNAi is an innate biological response, and hence represents a more natural strategy for manipulating gene expression. In any event, it means that physiologically beneficial silencing can be achieved with lower concentrations of effector molecules [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] (reviewed in [18], [24]).",

The second option is a gene therapy approach in which DNA encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes are delivered to cells to allow for intracellular expression of shRNAs, which are then processed into active siRNAs by the host cell [31], [32]. The potential advantages of the latter DNA approach include the inherently higher stability of transiently delivered plasmid DNAs and the fact that this strategy consists of an intracellular amplification step in which large amounts of shRNAs can be synthesized from each individual template. Additionally, it is also possible to deliver DNA expression vectors stably, either by integration into the genome or in self-replicating episomal form, which theoretically could allow for constitutive expression of the shRNA cassette.",

Firstly, it has been found that some cationic liposomes used to deliver siRNAs might induce or potentiate interferon responses [56], [57]. Likewise, any viral vector that might be used to transport shRNA expression cassettes into cells could stimulate an undesired vector-specific immune response. Secondly, the nature of siRNA effectors themselves may trigger the induction of the double-stranded RNA cellular defense mechanism. Although interferon induction might be beneficial for therapy in some instances, uncontrolled induction of this innate defense mechanism can be cytotoxic, and is therefore a concern. Initial gene expression profiling by different laboratories provided conflicting results regarding whether or not interferon is induced in response to siRNAs [55], [58], [59], [60], [61]. Recent studies, however, have started to systematically analyze these differences revealing that while certain siRNAs do induce an interferon response, others do not (reviewed in [62]). For example, Hornung et al. [63] have identified a 9 base pair \u201cdanger motif,\u201d which in the context of an siRNA effector induces interferon signaling. Additionally, the structure of introduced siRNA molecules can dictate whether or not interferons are induced, as Kim et al. [64] have reported that the presence of a 5\u2032 phosphate can trigger interferon induction. Consequently, careful design and screening of each candidate siRNA and delivery vehicle will be necessary to try to identify and minimize all potential adverse effects.",

Evidence suggests that when excess siRNAs are delivered to mammalian cells, the intracellular RNAi processing machinery can become saturated. This conclusion is drawn from studies that demonstrate competition between co-delivered siRNAs targeting two different genes [36] and inhibition of siRNA function by a co-delivered scrambled siRNA [66], [67]. While we are just beginning to appreciate the diverse roles miRNAs play in mammalian cells, accumulating data indicates that they are involved in many critical aspects of gene regulation (reviewed in [8], [9], [10]). Furthermore, alterations in the expression of miRNAs or their processing machinery have recently been implicated in several neurological diseases [68], [69], [70] and cancers [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77]. In some instances over expression of miRNAs has been found to be oncogenic [73], [76], [77], but in other cases reduced miRNA expression is observed in cancer cells [71], [74], [75]. It will therefore be important to assess the long-term consequences of RNAi therapy, in order to determine if miRNA functions are negatively affected. To overcome this problem, it might be necessary to analyze different doses of siRNAs to determine the maximum capacity of the intracellular siRNA processing machinery in different cell types.",

This problem is often cited when discussing the use of RNAi as an antiviral agent as it has been demonstrated that both RNA and DNA viruses can rapidly generate RNAi escape mutation [78], [79], [80], [81], [82]. This problem will probably necessitate the use of RNAi in combination therapy approaches, including multiple RNAi target sequences and/or other synergistic antivirals, such as small molecule inhibitors. Another possible issue regarding viral resistance is the discovery that analogous to plant viruses (reviewed in [5]), some mammalian viruses, such as Nodamura virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), encode genes that may interfere with RNAi silencing [6], [7]. Notably however, the effectiveness of these virally encoded genes in preventing therapeutic RNAi inhibition remains to be determined. Resistance of particular RNAs to RNAi-mediated degradation has also been observed in cases where accessibility of the target sequence was restricted. For cellular mRNAs, the structure of the target RNA has been found to affect silencing efficiency [83], [84]. For viral RNAs, resistance can also be related to intracellular location and/or nucleocapsid association of genomic RNA molecules [85], [86], [87].",

As altered expression of miRNAs and their processing enzyme, dicer, have recently been found to be associated with different types of cancer [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], it is possible that the processing machinery required for siRNA activity is not functionally normal in some tumor cells. Hence, depending on the nature of the oncogenic defect, it is possible that therapeutically delivered siRNAs may not be as effective in these cells. On a positive note, preliminary studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of siRNAs in multiple cancer models. Yet, the role miRNAs play in oncogenesis and how this might impact siRNA processing is an area that needs to be further investigated.",

Specifically, RNAi knocks-down gene expression, but generally does not eliminate it. For some conditions, partial down regulation of a pathogenic gene appears to be sufficient to produce clinically relevant improvement, however this is not \u201ccure\u201d. In the case of genetic diseases, a \u201ccure\u201d is not necessarily expected, but for other conditions such as cancer or infectious disease, the ideal goal of therapy would be to rid the patient of the disease. This limitation has been illustrated in several xenograph mouse tumor models in which siRNA silencing of oncogenes in vivo has been shown to slow the rate of tumor progression and prolong survival, but the tumors were not cleared [88], [89]. Hence, in many cases, RNAi treatment strategies may only be effective if designed in the context of a synergistic combinatorial therapy approach.",

When transfected into cells in culture, the inhibitory effect usually peaks at day 2 post-transfection and fades thereafter. Alterations in siRNA stability (see below) may prolong this effect, but in the absence of any endogenous RNAi mechanism for amplification or spread in mammalian cells, the activity of these delivered nucleic acids is expected to remain transient in nature. If the delivered siRNAs are part of an acute curative treatment, then transient activity might be sufficient, but in cases where RNAi suppression is part of a long-term treatment protocol it will require frequent dosing probably at significant cost. Notably, the desire to develop RNAi-based therapeutics for chronic conditions, such as genetic defects, is one of the main motivations for developing gene therapy delivery techniques, which presumably would allow for constitutive intracellular expression of the therapeutic shRNA.",

Not only are protective vehicles, such as liposomes, being designed to escort and target intact siRNA effectors for cellular uptake, but chemical modification of the siRNAs is also being investigated as a means of directly stabilizing the molecules. Importantly, several groups have shown that inhibition of gene expression by siRNAs is compatible with a broad spectrum of chemical modifications [26], [42], [90], [91], [92], [93]. Most recently, Morrissey et al. demonstrated that a combination of direct modifications improved stability, and thus in vivo efficacy of intravenously administered siRNAs [40].

Many reports have shown that pre-treatment or co-treatment with virus-specific siRNAs can be used to inhibit the expression and/or replication of numerous viruses in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in [94]) (Table 2). In particular, investigations into the potential antiviral benefits of RNAi have focused heavily on HIV (reviewed in [111]) and the hepatitis viruses (reviewed in [97], [114], [115]), as currently available treatment options against these viruses are inadequate. Furthermore, the availability of multiple well-defined HBV mouse models [116], [117] has made this virus a popular target for in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Initial in vivo hydrodynamic transfection experiments demonstrated that simultaneous delivery of HBV expression plasmids and HBV-specific siRNAs (or shRNA expression vectors) to the mouse liver can prevent the induction of HBV gene expression and replication [106], [107], [118]. To expand on those studies, we and others have further examined the therapeutic potential of RNAi for the treatment of chronic HBV infection using mouse models in which ongoing viral gene expression and replication are established in the liver prior to siRNA delivery [25], [42]. Although it has been shown that some viral RNAs are resistant to silencing [85], [86], [87] and some mammalian viruses, like HIV, may encode proteins that interfere with RNAi activity [7], in the case of HBV, significant inhibition of viral gene expression and replication was achieved by therapeutic administration of RNAi effectors in 2 different mouse models. Likewise, inhibition of influenza virus [35], coxsackievirus B3 [99], and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [36] infections have been inhibited by siRNAs delivered after the establishment of infection in mice.",

Because viruses can rapidly generate escape mutations when siRNAs are targeted directly to their genome [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [110], another potential RNAi antiviral strategy is to inhibit the expression of cellular factors that perpetuate the infection. In particular, HIV cellular receptors, such as CD4 and CCR5, are appealing targets for inhibition as this could significantly block initial viral entry into susceptible cell types [119], [120], [121], [122], [123]. Before implementing this type of indirect inhibition approach, however, it would be important to determine what other effects might occur as a result of down regulating the particular host gene in question, and this could limit the feasibility of this strategy against some viruses.",

For example, in the case of HBV, even chronically infected patients maintain a virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response throughout the course of infection.

ALS results from single nucleotide mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In 2003, Ding et al. [14] reported that siRNAs and PolIII-driven shRNAs could be designed to selectively silence a dominant mutant ALS allele. More recently, two reports have confirmed the effectiveness of this approach in a transgenic SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS [126], [127]. In both studies, lentiviral vectors were used to deliver shRNAs specific for the mutant SOD1. Both intramuscular and intrasplenic injection resulted in reduction of mutant SOD1(G93A) expression leading to a prolonged survival of motor neurons, a delay in the onset of ALS symptoms, and an increase in lifespan. Although the in vivo delivered shRNAs in these experiments were specific for the human transgene due to sequence differences between the mouse and human genes, the previous study by Ding et al., demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing more closely related human SOD1 alleles. In terms of general clinical application however, the bigger issue may be that ALS can be caused by more than 100 distinct SOD1 mutations. To address this issue, Xia et al. [139], have tested a \u201creplacement RNAi strategy\u201d in which they target inhibition of all mutant and wildtype forms of SOD1, while simultaneously delivering a functional SOD1 gene that is resistant to their siRNAs due to the presence of a silent mutation. If gene therapy approaches, such as lentivirus, are developed for the delivery SOD1-specifc siRNA, it should also be possible to use this type of replacement RNAi strategy.",

These diseases are caused by polyglutamine expansions in which CAG trinucleotide repeats are found in the mutant allele. In disease models of both HD and SCA1 the mutant protein has been shown to be toxic to neurons and that repression of the mutant gene is clinically beneficial in reversing motor dysfunction [140], [141], [142]. Two recent reports have used AAV vectors to express disease-specific shRNAs in the brain of transgenic mice that model HD [128] and SCA1 [40]. In both cases, expression of the mutant gene was reduced resulting in an improvement in behavior and neuropathological abnormalities. One caveat the authors acknowledge in both studies is that due to the nature of the transgenic model, the in vivo delivered shRNAs were by default specific for the mutant human transgene based on sequence differences between the mouse and human genes. However once again, previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that allele-specific targeting of genes containing polyglutamine expansions is possible [15]. Interestingly however, while it was determined that siRNA targets within the CAG repeat region do not necessarily result in allele-specific inhibition, the authors demonstrated that siRNAs could be designed to distinguish these alleles based on associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may or may not functionally contribute to the disease phenotype [15].",

Hence, siRNAs targeting the downregulation of BACE1 may be able to halt the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s.

Furthermore, reducing the rate of tumor cell proliferation might be expected to reduce the effectiveness of traditional therapies that preferentially target actively dividing cells. Hence, the potential use of RNAi to facilitate the effects of traditional cancer therapeutics has been proposed. For example, targeted suppression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene sensitizes cells to chemotherapy agents, such as etopodise and daunorubicin [158], [160], [161]. Likewise, siRNA silencing of double-strand break repair proteins, such as the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, confer enhanced radio and chemosensitivity to tumor cells [162], [163]. RNAi might also complement chemotherapy in the treatment of patients that have developed multidrug resistance. While over 30% of cancer patients develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents due to an over expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) [164], RNAi-mediated suppression of MDR1 has been shown to re-sensitize cells to the effects of chemotherapy [165], [166].

Finally, another cancer treatment approach being investigated is the use of RNAi to indirectly control tumor growth by inhibition of processes required for tumor spread. For example, in the case of breast cancer, transformed cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which promotes metastasis to organs abundant in CXCR4 ligand [167]. Several groups have shown RNAi-mediated inhibition of CXCR4 results in reduced cell invasion in vitro, as well as a block in breast cancer metastasis in xenograph animal models [146], [167], [168]. As a more general approach, members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, which are involved in the generation of new blood vessels required for tumor growth, are being tested as a potential anti-cancer treatment targets (reviewed in [169]). After transplanting tumor cells subcutaneously into mice, two groups have shown that intratumoral injections of VEGF-specific siRNAs, either naked or complexed with atelocollagen, blocked angiogenesis and limited tumor growth [156], [170]. More recently, Schiffelers et al. [46] achieved similar results delivering VEGF receptor-specific siRNAs to xenograph tumors by intravenous injection of ligand-targeted, stabilized nanoparticles.",

Hence, by targeting key molecules involved in these pathways, RNAi therapeutics may provide a means of controlling the cellular processes responsible. For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the chronic pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While drugs currently being used to block the action of TNF\u03b1 have been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and slowing RA progression, several risks, such as congestive heart failure, demyelinating diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, and serious infections, have been associated with the use of systemic TNF\u03b1-blockers [173]. In a preclinical mouse model of collagen induced arthritis, Schiffelers and colleagues recently demonstrated that local injection and electroporation of TNF\u03b1-specific siRNAs effectively inhibited paw inflammation in mice [133]. Furthermore, using an intravenously injected luciferase reporter, the authors subsequently showed that joint injection and electroporation of luciferase-specific siRNAs only inhibited the reporter gene locally. These studies suggest that in lieu of conventional anti-TNF\u03b1 blockers, local delivery of TNF\u03b1-specific siRNAs might provide a safer means of reducing inflammation in RA patients.",

In a mouse model of sepsis, it has been shown that pretreatment with TNF\u03b1-specific siRNAs injected intraperitoneally was able to increase survival rate sixfold after lethal lipopolysaccharide challenge [44]. Similarly, one of the first experiments to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RNAi used fas-specific siRNAs to protect mice against fulminant hepatitis [134], and another study reported that caspase 8-specific siRNA treatment also prevented acute liver failure [135]. These studies illustrate the concept that siRNAs might be used effectively to control acute responses whether that means limiting dangerous, uncontrolled inflammation or preventing hepatocyte apoptosis and preserving liver function (Table 3).",
