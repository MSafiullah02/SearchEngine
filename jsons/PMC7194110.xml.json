The typical location of the ulcerative and/or proliferative inflammatory lesions is lateral to the palatoglossal folds, previously referred to as the fauces.1, 2, 3 Clinically, a proliferative and ulcerative phenotype of the disease can be observed (Fig. 1\n). Occasionally, the proliferative form of the disease is so severe as to prevent retraction of the tongue (Fig. 2\n). Although FCGS is a familiar condition encountered in veterinary practice, with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.7% to 12.0%,4, 5, 6 there is much confusion regarding the cause and subsequent treatment of the disease.6\n,\n7 This article reviews the current knowledge on the etiopathogenesis of FCGS and describes the leading treatment modalities.",

The oral microbial diversity is less in cats with FCGS than in healthy cats, with the predominant species being Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida.17 Consistent with previous studies, a recent study found higher abundance of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria in FCGS and periodontitis.21 The phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Peptostreptococcus were more abundant in cats with FCGS than in healthy cats and cats with periodontitis. The findings suggest that Filifactor and Peptostreptococcus may play a role in periodontitis of FCGS. In contrast with the study mentioned previously, this study found higher bacterial diversity in the oral microbiota of cats with FCGS and periodontitis, suggesting a possible role of bacterial biofilms in the pathophysiology both of these oral diseases.",

Interestingly, none of the cats showed clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. In addition, microscopic evidence of inflammation and metaplasia was found on histopathologic evaluation of grossly normal-appearing tissues. Endoscopic reexamination of 2 cats that were treated for FCGS and no longer showed clinical signs of that disease also showed macroscopic healing of esophagitis. One cat that had a relapse of FCGS showed worsening of esophagitis despite appropriate treatment of esophagitis. Prior medications, salivary and esophageal lumen pH, and chronicity of FCGS signs do not correlate with the degree of esophagitis. The investigators speculated that the virulent oral microbiota of cats with FCGS is transmitted to the esophagus via the saliva, where the production of certain proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to the development of esophagitis. In light of the findings of this study, diagnosis and treatment or empiric treatment of esophagitis may be considered in cats affected by FCGS, especially considering that both diseases share some clinical signs (ie, ptyalism, nausea, and inappetence).35\n",

Furthermore, environmental stressors such as multicat environments seem to be an important contributing factor. The current first line of treatment involves dental extractions of at least the premolar and molar teeth as opposed to medical therapy alone. Following surgical treatment, outcome can be divided into approximate thirds for cats achieving remission, substantial improvement, and little to no improvement. Most cats that undergo surgical treatment need concurrent medical therapy for control of inflammation, some requiring lifelong medical management. New modalities such as MSC therapy show promise. In addition, the importance of analgesic therapy cannot be overemphasized.",
