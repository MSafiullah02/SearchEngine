At present, such data is generally not available, so we have elected to use a strategy whereby we obtain surrogate data by means of simulation in order to illustrate how R can be used to decide which districts to include in a lockdown. Section 5 describes the agent-based simulation model used to generate the surrogate data and obtain an estimation of the reproduction matrix R for the city of Santiago. In this model, agents represent people who can become infected by interacting with infected agents. They are placed in a grid so as to reproduce the real limits and densities of the city (and its districts) and to emulate daily commuter traffic-flow patterns based on real public transportation data. We explain how this model can be used to describe the propagation of the infection through the city and between the districts, and how the matrix R is estimated from a set of simulation replicates. We note that density, transportation and the spatial configuration of districts are the main characteristics determining the variability in the values of elements of the matrix R.",

This is a weaker measure than the lockdown discussed above. If L and L c are the two groups, the new matrix R cs encapsulating the cordon sanitaire policy must preserve the values R(i, j) for districts i and j inside the same group, but set R cs (i, j) = 0 when districts i and j belong to L and L c or to L c and L respectively. Thus, R cs = R cs (i, j) : i, j \u2208 I m , where",
