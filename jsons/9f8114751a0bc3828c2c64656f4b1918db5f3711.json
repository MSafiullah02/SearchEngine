Due to the hydrophobic nature of proteins embedded within the membrane, purification, and subsequently antibody production, have been difficult to achieve. This is especially true with plant-derived membrane proteins, where many important enzymes are limited in abundance (Sussman 1 994) .",

While most of the selected examples cited in this review are based upon living systems, the approaches described should serve as important tools for investigating mechanisms of senescence and quality maintenance in postharvest and postmortem food systems (Haard 1995) .

            "text": "Membrane-bound proteins are classified as either integral or peripheral. Integral membrane proteins are largely embedded in the membrane and are therefore strongly hydrophobic. Detergents must be used to solubilize integral membrane proteins from the membrane (Hjelmeland and Chrambach 1984) . Integral proteins virtually always contain multiple transmembrane segments, connected by hydrophilic sequences which loop out of the membrane bilayer (Gennis 1989 ). The number of transmembrane helices and surface loops is determined by hydropathy analysis, which requires a full-length cDNA clone (Kyte and Doolit- . Peripherally-associated membrane proteins can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic but are not embedded within the membrane. They associate with the membrane by either electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, or via a hydrophobic \"tail\" anchored in the membrane, and can be dissociated from the membrane by washing with salts or chaotropic ions (Gennis 1989) . Some membrane-bound proteins, such as plasma membrane H + -ATPases (Ser-ran0 1989; Sussman 1994) , members of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family (Chrispeels and Maurel 1994; Agre et al. 1995; King and Agre 1996; Verkman etal. 1996) and the vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase of higher plants (Rea etal. 1992; Kim et al. 1994 ) exist as individual subunits or multisubunit complexes embedded largely within the membrane. Onthe other hand, large multisubunit complexes such as the chloroplast ATPase (Feng and McCarty 1990a; Feng and McCarty 1990b; Avital and Gromet-Elhanan 1991) , chloroplast photosystems (Cohen et al. 1995) , coated vesicle ATPase (Arai et al. 1988; Adachi et al. 1990a; Adachi et al. 1990b) and tonoplast ATPase of plants (Rea et al. 1987; Lai et al. 1988; Parry et al. 1989; Sze et al. 1992 ) and fungi (Bowman et al. 1989; Moriyama and Nelson 1989) contain a combination of integral and peripheral subunits, and can be visualized by \"ball and stalk-like'' protrusions from the membrane (Dschida and Bowman 1992; Getz and Klein 1995) . Examples of well-characterized peripherally-bound proteins would include the plasma membrane GTP-binding subunits (Rho lp) of yeast (1,3)-@-glucan synthases (Drgonova et al. 1996; Qadota et al. 1996) , and a 62-kDa sucrose binding protein associated with the external surface the plasma membrane of soybean (Overvoorde and Grimes 1994; Overvoorde et al. 1996) .",

Grey have led to the discovery of antigen processing, whereby extracellular proteins must first be ingested and fragmented into peptides by an antigen-presenting cell before an immune response can occur (Engelhard 1994). Consequently, it should be possible to carry out peptide digestion with an insoluble enzyme such as trypsin attached to polyacrylamide beads in order to improve antigenicity. Short peptides containing the hydrophilic loop portions of the protein may be produced during trypsinization. Since the trypsin is insoluble, it can be centrifuged, pelleted, and removed, leaving only the fragmented protein. Trypsinized peptides can then be used as an antigen for immunization. This approach was used to generate antibodies recognizing plasma membrane intrinsic proteins from Beta vulgaris L. (Wasserman er al. 1996) .",

First, they may not recognize the native protein if certain domains are deeply embedded in the membrane and inaccessi-ble to the antibody. This means that they may be unable to immunoprecipitate enzyme activity and can therefore be used only for immunoblotting. In addition, due to their small size, the peptides may not possess sufficient immunogenicity to induce a satisfactory immune response.

After SDS-PAGE, gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and probed with either affinity purified anti-PMIP3I (Panel A) or anti-PMIP27 (Panel B) at a dilution of 1:20oO. Blots were developed by enhanced cherniluminescence (ECL, Amersham. Arlington Heights, IL).",
