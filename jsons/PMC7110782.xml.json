From 2004/2005 through 2008/2009 seasons, annual vaccination rates among control groups in children aged 6\u201323 months were 66.6% (213/320), 61.8% (139/225), 57.1% (129/226), 41.0% (236/575), and 47.1% (115/244), which were higher than the rates in those aged 24\u201359 months (10.7% (75/699), 21.2% (65/306), 18.6% (70/376), 19.4% (94/485), and 19.0% (96/506)) (test for trend, p\n < 0.0001 and p\n < 0.001 for the two age groups, respectively).

The national vaccine coverage changed to 48.2% (255 565/530 561) for children aged 6\u201335 months in the 2008/2009 season when the influenza vaccination program was extended to those aged 24\u201335 months.

Further studies should be conducted to clarify such important issues. Another challenge exists in establishing and maintaining the quality of the vaccination register for vaccination programs, especially for annual influenza vaccinations; such a register will provide information for resource allocation, comprehensive evaluation, and a timely response to all vaccine-preventable diseases.28\n",

This might be explained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in Taiwan in 2003 and the introduction of the influenza vaccination program in the 2004/2005 season for children aged 6\u201323 months. Both of these events were an incentive to parents to have their young children vaccinated with the influenza vaccine during the early part of the study.",

            "text": "The possibility of cross-protection by influenza vaccine with a suboptimal match has been debated.42 In years with a suboptimal match, the VE has typically been lower or even not clearly demonstrated.40, 41 However, we found that only 12% of circulating strains were similar to the vaccine strains in the 2007/2008 season, but the VE was not as low as expected. The lack of significant VE in 6\u201323-month-old children despite a high vaccine match in the 2005/2006 and 2008/2009 seasons might be related to the low ILI rates, which were associated with the relatively small sample size of children who tested positive for influenza.40 The seasonal variations in terms of the proportions of case subjects in our data obtained from the Viral Surveillance Network may reflect the variable nature of influenza epidemics.38 The effect measure modification of age might be a concern in the analysis of vaccine effectiveness; therefore it was appropriate to demonstrate both age strata and age adjustment in the statistical models to estimate vaccine effectiveness.43\n",

This may not be appropriate for infants aged 6\u201323 months.45 We speculate that the younger the children were, the less chance they had had to experience the circulating local strains in previous seasons for immune priming before vaccination, which could have led to an underestimation of VE among younger children if they were only partially immunized. Besides, high vaccine coverage (50\u201370%) in children could possibly have an impact on reducing influenza-related morbidity and mortality, not only among the vaccinated children, but also in other age groups.30, 37 The challenge of increasing vaccine coverage still exists.",

            "text": "The findings of this study are subject to several limitations. First, children with underlying medical conditions are at even greater risk of an adverse outcome related to influenza than healthy children.33, 39 Data linkage of the Viral Surveillance Network and the NIIS did not provide personal medical information, so we could not examine this issue. Second, only two categories of vaccination status were defined in this study. To resolve this problem, a validation study to confirm the serology indicator of an HAI antibody titer \u22651:40 after one dose of trivalent influenza vaccine between two age strata might assist in confirming the immunization status in different geographic areas.46 Third, there might have been selection bias with regard to the vaccination status of subjects who were enrolled for laboratory testing. It is possible that the testing of samples was biased as this was done by the clinicians who provided the influenza shot to the patient. However, in Taiwan, most patients can see the doctor of their choice, therefore, most clinicians would not know the patient's influenza vaccination status. If sampling was done on an informed basis such that the sentinel physician collected fewer swabs from vaccinated ILI patients, a potential biasing of estimates of effectiveness upwards might have occurred.47 In the test-negative design for estimating influenza VE, effectiveness does not vary by health-seeking behavior with the assumption that the distribution of non-influenza causes of acute respiratory infection does not vary by influenza vaccination status.15 Therefore, cases and controls in our study probably had similar characteristics with regard to their willingness to seek medical care and their willingness to be swabbed, which could eliminate the uncontrolled confounding between cases and controls. The Viral Surveillance Network did not include all ILI patients (those willing to be swabbed and those not willing to be swabbed), thus it was not possible to determine the characteristics of the children who were swabbed and those who were not. The voluntary enrolment of swabbed participants in our study raises the question of potential selection bias, which might bias the VE estimation and limit the generalizability.3 Fourth, the impact of repeated seasonal influenza vaccination on vaccine effectiveness against influenza A and B virus has been debated, and further studies are needed to provide more clear evidence.48, 49 As this was an observational study, residual confounding may still be present despite different statistical models. We plan to investigate this further in the future.50\n",
