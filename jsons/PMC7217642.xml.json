However, the safety of this approach in poor communities has not been evaluated, and it is plausible that lives lost to lockdown could exceed those saved from COVID-19. Potentially fatal unintended consequences include widespread economic disruption and hunger, worsening food insecurity if harvesting is disrupted, and increased domestic and state actor violence. Large numbers of African patients with HIV and tuberculosis depend on functional health services, with substantial individual and public health consequences if treatment access is disrupted.2 Although anticipated by national programmes, some treatment interruptions are inevitable during prolonged lockdown.",

We used Spiegelhalter's approach to compare age-group specific infection fatality ratios from COVID-19 to background (non-COVID-19) mortality risk in Malawi, South Africa, the UK, and India.3, 4, 5 This assumes COVID-19 infection fatality ratios similar to China, but true age-specific case-fatality rates might be higher with fragile health systems. For context, Malawi has not yet triggered lockdown, whereas the UK, South Africa, and India have. We estimate that in the UK, having COVID-19 confers risk of death equivalent to approximately 12 months of background mortality risk, averaged across all age groups. By contrast, in Malawi this risk is equivalent to 4 months of background mortality (appendix). This reflects higher background mortality rates in Malawi, underscoring the fragility of health under normal circumstances.",
