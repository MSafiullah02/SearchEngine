Their clinical beneficiary [2] and adverse [3] effects to the COVID-19 patients have been discussed based on the direct and related clinical evidences. An important question is whether the pros of these traditional medicines outweigh the cons or vice versa for the COVID-19 patients, which is to be clinically resolved. Inflammation regulation is a key mechanism of these traditional medicines against COVID-19 [4] . The discussed adverse effects are largely related to inflammation [3] . Therefore, some indications may be learned from the clinical profiles of the inflammation-associated diseases that involve similar sets of regulators as COVID-19 and have been treated by the same traditional medicines.",

In-vitro and in-vivo studies have led to useful clues to certain common inflammation-regulatory mechanisms of these traditional medicines against COVID-19 [4] , viral infections [5] and other inflammation-related disease conditions (Supplementary Table S1 ). These preclinical clues combined with clinical data analysis are useful for assessing the clinical effects of the traditional medicines against these diseases, particularly with the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f aid of multi-omics analysis [6] .

The regulatory roles of these targets (Supplementary Table S4 ) are consistent with the differentiallyrecommended clinical utilities of these traditional medicine ( Table 1) . These traditional medicines universally reduce innate immunity induced inflammation and tissue damage, by targeting specific regulators, including several key regulators that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f are critical or required for the inflammation processes ( Table 1) . In particular, a key regulator ALOX15 and a non-key regulator CDK6 is the target of 5 and 6 of the 8 traditional medicines respectively. Significantly, all three medicines for the clinical treatment period target two key regulators, while three of the four medicines for the fever cases of the medical observation period target one key regulator, and the medicine for the non-fever cases target non-key regulators only.",
