These envelope proteins mediate both the initial virion attachment to the cell, as well as the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes; these processes result in the release of viral contents into the host cell.

At the carboxyl end of this coiled coil, the polypeptide chains reverse direction, and the base of the coiled coil is supported by additional structures. In HIV-1 and SIV gp41, influenza HA2 and Ebola GP2, this support comes from three extended helices packed on the exterior of the coiled coil. In MoMLV TM, a short helix and a more extended region in each monomer serve to stabilize the coiled coil. In all five structures, the C-terminal residues extend back towards the N-terminal end of the coiled coil to form a hairpin-like structure.",

            "text": "Do other enveloped viruses share similar structures for membrane fusion? Computational methods provide a quick way to begin addressing this question for a large, diverse group of viruses. The lack of sequence similarity among viral membrane-fusion proteins requires computational tools more sensitive than alignment-based methods. Fortunately, the coiled-coil structure common to HIV-1 gp41, SIV gp41, influenza HA2, MoMLV TM, and Ebola GP2 is a motif for which several prediction schemes have already been developed Parry 1982, Lupas et al 1991, Berger et al 1995, Wolf et al 1997. Nevertheless, these methods cannot be used alone to recognize the coiled coils in membrane-fusion proteins. For example, the coiled-coil region in HIV-1 (Chan et al., 1997) is scored with low likelihood (\u2a7d10 %) using either PairCoil (Berger et al., 1995), MultiCoil (Wolf et al., 1997) or COILS (Lupas et al., 1991). Several authors have previously noted heptad repeat patterns visually in viral membrane-fusion proteins Groot et al 1987, Gallaher et al 1989, Delwart et al 1990, Chambers et al 1990. However, the probability of a heptad repeat pattern occurring by chance in a protein sequence is significant (Brendel & Karlin, 1989), and predicting coiled coils \u201cby eye\u201d may therefore lead to significant over-prediction. For this reason, reliable computational methods are necessary in evaluating whether these patterns actually correspond to coiled-coil-like structures.",

These proteins are quite diverse, with no apparent sequence similarity between most pairs of viruses in different families, or between some viruses within the same family. The LearnCoil-VMF program also helps further characterize the overall core structure of these viral membrane-fusion proteins. The exterior of the HIV-1 gp41 core is made up of three extended amphipathic helices that contain a heptad repeat and wrap around the interior coiled coil in a left-handed direction (Figure 1); the LearnCoil-VMF program identifies these coiled-coil-like helices in HIV-1 as well as in other viruses in the lentivirus genus of retroviruses. Intriguingly, LearnCoil-VMF also identifies two coiled-coil-like regions in many paramyxovirus membrane-fusion proteins. A recent result shows that peptides containing the two predicted coiled-coil-like regions in the paramyxovirus simian parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5) interact with each other to form an \u03b1-helical trimeric complex (Joshi et al., 1998).",

The subsequences shown are aligned (using the output of LearnCoil-VMF) to the N36/C34 fragment crystallized for HIV-1 gp41 (Chan et al., 1997) and SIV gp41 (Malashkevich et al., 1998). For the envelope protein sequences shown in Table 1, Table 2, two coiled-coil-like regions are detected by LearnCoil-VMF in HIV-1, SIV, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), visna virus, and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), but only one coiled-coil-like region is found in equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). However, the sequence features shown in Table 2 shared between EIAV and BIV and the other lentiviruses suggests that a second helix exists in EIAV and BIV, although the LearnCoil-VMF method is not able to detect it. In particular, the heptad repeat is maintained in the N-terminal portion of these subsequences, as it is in the other lentivirus sequences given. Furthermore, in both the HIV-1 and SIV structures, there are two tryptophan residues in the C-terminal helix that fit into a conserved pocket found in the interior three-stranded coiled coil Chan et al 1997, Chan et al 1998, Malashkevich et al 1998; these residues (corresponding to columns 1 and 4 in Table 2) are conserved in EIAV, while the first tryptophan residue is conserved in BIV and the second is replaced by a leucine residue. Finally, for an alignment of the lentivirus envelope sequences, the PHD secondary structure program predicts the region shown in Table 2 as helical, with 85% of the predictions with reliability index at least 8 (the three-state accuracy for predictions with reliability index 8 or higher is 91.1%) Rost and Sander 1993, Rost and Sander 1994, Rost et al 1994. \u2021 Thus, computational methods argue that for the lentivirus membrane-fusion proteins, there are two coiled-coil-like regions that form a six-helical bundle structure similar to that found in HIV-1.",

(For MoMLV, this places the start of the helix five residues C-terminal to the fragment solved by X-ray crystallography (Fass et al., 1996).) Additionally, in all of these sequences except Rous sarcoma virus, the same region scores as coiled-coil-like when using the MultiCoil program with windows of length 14 (individual likelihoods varying from 0.31 to 0.71); this suggests a short amphipathic helix. This computational evidence is consistent with circular dichroism (CD) experiments on MoMLV that show additional helical content C-terminal of the coiled-coil structure (Fass & Kim, 1995). Additionally, these retrovirus envelope sequences share sequence similarity with Ebola GP2, and recent X-ray crystallography studies reveal a helix in this region Weissehorn et al 1998b, Malashkevich et al 1999.",

In fact, the sequence similarity between the Rous sarcoma virus envelope protein and Ebola GP2 extends throughout the membrane-fusion domain of these sequences (Gallaher, 1996).\u2021 Thus, sequence analysis suggests that the Ebola GP2 contains a coiled coil, flanked by a short amphipathic helix on its outer core, and this is in agreement with recent structural studies Weissehorn et al 1998b, Malashkevich et al 1999. Although LearnCoil-VMF does not find a coiled-coil-like region in the Marburg virus GP, its sequence similarity to Ebola within this region (Table 6) suggests a similar structure.",

Additionally, other protein sequences in the PDB with known coiled-coil structures, such as GCN4 (PDB accession ID 2zta), still score as coiled-coil-like using the LearnCoil-VMF program. On the other hand, although some non-coiled-coil sequences from the PDB are detected by the LearnCoil-VMF algorithm, the vast majority are not, indicating specificity in the learned tables. Finally, despite the significant sequence diversity in many viral membrane-fusion proteins within a particular genus, LearnCoil-VMF is usually consistent in recognizing similar regions within them. For example, although the lentivirus sequences in Table 1 vary considerably, the coiled-coil-like regions that the LearnCoil-VMF program identifies are all similarly located within the protein sequences (i.e., following the protein maturation cleavage site).",

Additionally, for many of these proteins, there is computational evidence for the existence of helices that pack against the outside of the coiled coil. For many of the retrovirus membrane-fusion proteins, such as those in the mammalian type C, avian type C, and type D genera, secondary structure prediction indicates a short, amphipathic helix following the N-terminal coiled-coil-like region. For the lentivirus membrane-fusion proteins, the two coiled-coil-like regions found by LearnCoil-VMF, in conjunction with the HIV-1 and SIV gp41 crystal structures, suggest amphipathic helices packed against the length of the three-stranded coiled-coil core. Two similarly placed coiled-coil-like regions are also found in the paramyxovirus membrane-fusion proteins, and studies on SV5 indicate that the two coiled-coil-like regions interact to form a trimer of heterodimers (Joshi et al., 1998) (see also note added in proof).",

It uses probability estimates (see below) of each residue pair existing in each pair of heptad repeat positions. To obtain normalized probabilities, each probability for a given pair of heptad repeat positions distance i apart is divided by the corresponding distance-i probability for sequences in Genpept. Normalized singles probabilities are computed similarly. A residue propensity in a given heptad repeat position incorporates correlations between that residue and the residues that follow at distances i = 1, i = 2 and i = 4 (chosen empirically). For normalized probabilities P, the propensity of kth residue is given by:13lnP(k,k+1)P(k,k+2)P(k,k+4)P(k+1)P(k+2)P(k+4) Windows of length 30 are considered, and a window score for a particular heptad-repeat position is the sum of the residue propensities in the window. Finally, the residue score for the kth residue is the maximum window score over all windows containing it in all seven possible heptad repeat positions, and each sequence score is the maximum score over all its residues. Each score is converted into a likelihood in the interval [0,1] using the methods described by Berger et al 1995, Berger and Singh 1997. Mathematical justification of the scoring subroutine can be found in Berger (1995).",

That is, a number is drawn uniformly at random from the interval [0,1], and if the number drawn is less than or equal to the likelihood of the sequence, then the sequence is selected for the new database. If a sequence is selected, regions in the sequence where the residues have a likelihood of greater than or equal to either the sequence likelihood or 0.5 are included in the new database.
