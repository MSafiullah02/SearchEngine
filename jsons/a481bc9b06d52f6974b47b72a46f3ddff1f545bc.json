Five of 256 patients developed serologic (CF) evidence of 229E virus infection. At the same time, various experimental cell cultures were under evaluation for their sensitivity to rhinoviruses and strain 229E. We therefore took advantage of this opportunity by attempting to isolate virus strains resembling 229E from the original specimens of these 5 patients in such cell cultures. In addition, specimens were obtained from patients with upper respiratory tract illnesses who participated in a more recent (1965) (1966) (1967) cross-sectional study. 2 With the use of semi-continuous human embryonic intestine (HEI) cell cultures, a virus similar to 229E virus was isolated from 3 of the 5 patients with serologic evidence of infection and from 6 patients in the more recent study whose serologic response to 229E virus was not known at the time of the attempts at isolation. The recovery of these 9 virus strains represents the only reported isolation of viruses similar to 229E virus from natural infections since the original description of this agent. A description of these virus strains and certain observations concerning their epidemiology form the basis of this report.",

These specimens were inoculated within I hr of collection into 2 roller tubes each of Hep-2, MK, WI26 and/or WI38, human aorta (AT-39), and HEK cultures [15] . The remaining nasal fluid was stored at -60 C. Tissue cultures were obtained from commercial sources, maintained as previously described, incubated at 33-34 C on drums rotating at 12 revolutions per hour, and observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) twice weekly [16] . MK cultures were tested for hemadsorption at 5-7-day intervals, and a single blind subpassage of the HEK culture harvests was made at 21 days. Acute phase sera were obtained at the time the washings were collected and convalescent sera about 3 weeks later. Five specimens from the 1962-1964 study and all specimens from the more recent study (1965) (1966) (1967) were also inoculated as above into HEI tissue culture; although some specimens were inoculated into HEI cultures within 1 hr of collection, most had been stored at -60 C prior to inoculation.",

The 3 nasal wash specimens which yielded 229Erelated viruses from the 1962~1964 study were obtained within a 7-week period, March 2 to April 13, 1964 , while the 6 virus-positive nasal wash specimens from the 1965-1967 study were obtained during the first 3 months of 1967 (table  1) . The specimens were inoculated into roller tube cultures as stated in the Methods section. None of the inoculations into rhesus MK, Hep-2 HDCS WI26 or WI38, AT -39, or HEK cultures g~ve CPE. However, all 9 specimens produced CPE on initial passage in HEI tissue culture. The CPE was characterized by a gradual elongation of the cells throughout the monolayer beginning on the fifth or sixth day after inoculation; specific foci were not evident. Gradually, small granular round cells appeared throughout the monolayer. The cell sheet was rarely destroyed completely. At times uninoculated HEI tissue cultures appeared somewhat \"stringy,\" and for this reason recognition of virus-specific CPE was occasionally difficult, especially at the beginning of the study. Electron microscopic and filtration studies. HEI culture harvests were clarified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation and examined by electron microscopy. Figure I shows representative particles seen in the harvests of isolate 489. Morphologically similar particles were seen in harvests of each of the other 8 isolates. A comparison of the isolates with strain 229E (figure 2), and avian IBV (figure 3), revealed their remarkable similarity. The particles usually appeared round or elliptical, but many were somewhat pleomorphic. A characteristic feature of the particles was the widely spaced club-or pear-shaped surface projections, which were narrow at the base, about 10 m,u wide at the outer edge, and approximately 20 mu in length. The mean of the largest diameter (including projections) of 67 samples of the 9 isolates was 152 m,u \u00b1 6 mu (i.e., \u00b12 X standard error [SE] of mean) with a range of 104-250 me; the mean of the shortest diameter of these 67 samples was 107 m,u \u00b1 4 m,u (i.e., \u00b12 X SE of mean) with a range of 76-160 mu. Details of the morphology of this group of viruses have been described elsewhere [7] [8] [9] [10] 25] . In filtration studies, in which Swinnex-25 filter units attached to 20-ml vacuum tubes were employed, virus strain 844 passed 285 through a 450-m,u, 220-m,u, and 100-m,u but not a 50-m,u or 10-m,u Millipore filter [26, 27] .",

            "text": "The 9 229E-related strains were recovered on initial passage in semi-continuous HEI tissue cultures; they could not be isolated on initial passage in conventional tissue cultures. In addition, since the technique of O.C. passage followed by electron microscopic examination of pooled, concentrated O.C. harvests had proved to be a sensitive system for the recovery of NIH O.C. viruses, this technique was applied both to several clinical specimens yielding agents resembling strain 229E and to several tissue-culture-adapted strains as well. In all cases, attempts to detect virus by electron microscopy in O.C. harvests failed, although titration of such harvests showed in 1 case that low-grade replication of virus probably occurred. It appears, therefore, that HEI tissue culture is preferable to O.C. for isolation of certain strains of \"IBV-like\" viruses such as these 229E-related agents. It should be noted, however, that the 6 \"IBV-like\" strains recovered in O.C. in this laboratory could not be adapted to grow in HEI tissue culture [K. Mcl ntosh, unpublished studies]. Therefore, for isolation of \"\"IBV-like\" viruses, it would appear to be necessary to employ both HEI tissue culture and O.C. However, additional ways to facilitate the growth of \"IBV-like\" viruses such as 229E and others must be found since HEI cultures, although more sensitive than any conventional tissue culture or O.C. system, were much less sensitive than the measurement of CF antibody rises for detection of 229E infection.",

            "text": "The serologic survey of 229E virus infection in various population groups revealed that infection with this agent was rare in infants and children with lower respiratory tract illnesses. In the 1962-1964 study of upper respiratory tract illness among adults, 5 (2%) of 256 individuals had serologic evidence of 229E infection. It was noteworthy that these 5 infections occurred from January through April, 1964, when rhinovirus and other known respiratory virus infections were uncommon but upper respiratory tract illnesses were prevalent; during this period 229E virus infection was associated with 5 (10%) of the 50 illnesses sampled. In the 1965-1967 study of upper respiratory tract illness in adults, 23 (7%) of 317 patients dev.eloped serologic evidence of 289 229E infection. It was striking that 21 of the 23 infections occurred during a 5-month period (December, 1966 -April, 1967 when infections with rhinoviruses and other cytopathic or hemadsorbing viruses were uncommon while upper respiratory tract illness remained prevalent. During this 5-month period, 21 (24%) of 89 patients studied developed serologic (CF)\u00b7 evidence of 229E infection. It was previously reported that 5 NIH O.C. viruses were recoveredin O.C. from specimens obtained from 9 patients during a 3month period of the previous year (December, 1965 -February, 1966 [7] . In addition, in a serologic survey using as antigen 2 serologically identical NIH O.C. viruses (strains OC38 and OC43) originally recovered in O.C., and subsequently adapted to grow in the brain of suckling mice, 18 (31%) of 59 patients (including the 5 patients above who yielded NIH O.C. viruses) developed serologic evidence of infection with these viruses during this 3-month period (December, 1965 -February, 1966 [29] ; only 1 of the 59 patients developed a CF antibody rise to 229E virus during this period. It was of interest that, in these CF antibody surveys, patients with serologic evidence of 229E infection rarely developed concurrent CF antibody rises to the OC38 and OC43 mouse brain antigens [30] .",

The virus isolates exhibited properties typical of the \"IBV-like\" virus group: distinctive morphology, resistance to 5-IUDR, and chloroform sensitivity. Measurement of CF antibody response was found to be approximately twice as sensitive as virus recovery for detection of infection. Standard monolayer tissue cultures as well as human fetal tracheal a.c. were ineffective for recovery and recognition of the 229E related isolates. A seroepidemiologic survey indicated that 229E virus infection was rare in children with lower respiratory tract disease.
