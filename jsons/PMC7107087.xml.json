            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes an acute and highly contagious viral disease of chickens that is characterized by respiratory signs, nephritis, and reduced egg reproduction (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Among the IBV structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is responsible for attachment to the host cellular membrane, induction of neutralization, and hemagglutination of inhibiting antibodies (Casais et al., 2003; Cavanagh, 2007). Because of the high rates of S1 gene mutation, several IBV serotypes or antigenic variant strains have been reported in many countries (Cavanagh, 2007). In general, different serotypes of the virus do not confer cross protection against each other (Ignjatovi\u0107 and Sapats, 2000), and cross protection tends to diminish as the degree of amino acid identity between the S1 proteins of 2 IBV strains decreases (Gelb et al., 2005). However, some strains of the virus are effective at inducing cross protection against other serotypes or genotypes; these are referred to as protectotypes. Protectotypes have been suggested as a valuable method for the development of strategies to control IBV infections (Dhinakar Raj and Jones, 1996).",

In addition, QX-like nephropathogenic strains have increased the genetic diversity of IBV in the field and caused economic losses in the poultry industry (Worthington and Jones, 2006). Our previous study revealed that QXIBV strain originating from China has been introduced in Korea and has formed a variant virus by recombination with the Korean nephropathogenic strain (KM91 strain; Lim et al., 2011). Furthermore, more recently, some IBV strains formed a new cluster that is very distant from all major genogroups in the phylogenetic tree of the IBV S1 gene. Because the emergence of new variant strains complicates disease control, there is a concern about whether commercial IBV vaccines could provide protection against these new IBV strains. Nevertheless, genetic and protectotypic characterization of new variant IBV strains remains largely undone.",

The IBV isolates belonging to new genetic cluster 2 possessed low amino acid identity (<58.7% similarity) to the 2 vaccine strains (H120 and K2). In particular, the challenge strains K716/05, K40/09, and K245/09 of new cluster 1 shared 79.6, 80.4, and 78.9% amino acid similarity to S1 from the H120 strain and 88.8, 90.9, and 89.6% similarity to that of the K2, respectively.

A previous study indicated that a recent Korean IBV isolate (Kr/D64/05) was closely related to the China CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains (Lee et al., 2008), and the prevalence of QX-like IBV strains in Korea is reminiscent of the spread of the China QXIBV strain in many Eurasian countries (Beato et al., 2005; Gough et al., 2008). The origin of this variant IBV strain is unclear, but the geographical closeness between China and Korea might have fostered IBV transmission and exchange of IBV genetic material. Furthermore, migrating birds are considered to be potential vectors of IBV due to the ability of IBV to replicate even in an asymptomatic teal, which is a member of the largely migratory order Anseriformes (Liu et al., 2005). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of spread of IBV over long distances by wild birds.",

However, development of vaccines against new IBV variants is not generally an option, owing to the high cost and time required for their final approval (Jackwood et al., 2003; Bijlenga et al., 2004). Some IBV vaccine strains from a certain serotype may provide protection against IBV strains not belonging to that serotype (Cook et al., 1999). Thus, performing protection studies (protectotype) with new IBV isolates is a highly relevant and practical method in control strategies of IBV, because it provides direct information about the efficacy of currently available IBV vaccines. In the present study, IBV isolates belonging to new clusters showed low amino acid homology compared with the 2 vaccine strains (H120 and K2 strain), but the K2 strain could provide greater protection against the challenge with recombinant strains K716/05, K40/09, and K245/09 and variant strain K26/09 than that conferred by the commercial H120 vaccine. As already proposed, good protection can be achieved by vaccines containing serotypes that differ both antigenically and genetically from the challenge virus (Cook et al., 1999). The reason might be that, despite extensive differences in the S1 protein, much of the virus genome remains unchanged and there are epitopes in common among different strains of IBV, which play a major role in protective immunity (Cavanagh et al., 1997).",

Despite the widespread use of vaccines, outbreaks related to nephropathogenic strains of different serotypes have increased in many countries (Li and Yang, 2001; Liu et al., 2006b). In Europe, a combination of the Mass and 4/91 vaccine regimen have prevented nephropathogenic IBV infection (Terregino et al., 2008). However, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines raises concerns regarding the formation of variant viruses by recombination with field strains resulting from the spread of vaccine strains (Farsang et al., 2002). Furthermore, use of 4/91 strains is prohibited in some countries, including Korea, due to the absence of its outbreak in fields. Previous studies demonstrated that the highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine strain K2 provides great protection against 2 distinct subgroups of nephropathogenic strains (KM91-like and QX-like; Lee et al., 2010). Moreover, a present study revealed that the K2 strain has a broad cross-protective ability against nephropathogenic recombinant and variant strains. Therefore, a single administration of the K2 strain might be effective and suitable for application in many countries where the nephropathogenic IBV infection is a major problem.",
