It is hard to describe and report such a thing in academic literature especially when journals' submission systems can mandate using at least five keywords to describe your work. As a result, researchers started creating names using terms related to geography (e.g., \u201cWuahan Pneumonia\u201d), some adding a date (\u201cCoronavirus 2019\u201d), and the others having a setting (\u201cWuhan Seafood Market Pneumonia Virus\u201d).",

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were being updated so frequently that it was hard to keep up. My colleague asked \u201cWhat if they change the Supplementary Concept tomorrow?\u201d Ironically, I had to change my search strategy the following day because MeSH changed the concept from \u201cWuhan Coronavirus\u201d to \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.\u201d Fortunately, NLM has documented these changes [5,6]. When some of the Supplementary Concepts become a Subject Heading, they may change again. It may take decades until a well-known concept becomes a subject heading. Recent examples are \u201cMeta-Analysis\u201d and \u201cSystematic Reviews\u201d that were added to MeSH only in 2008 and 2019, respectively, when hitherto they were not even supplementary concepts.",

Apart from the fact that designing search strategies can be subjective and strategies may vary from one search expert to another, terminology is changing rapidly and search strategies that were accurate when first published can become unreliable and unable to retrieve relevant literature in a consistent manner. Although search experts rely on reported terms by the authors and indexing terms from indexing bodies\u2014both shown to be insufficient for COVID-19\u2014we would all benefit from a single source of truth: a standardized and up-to-date way to find literature on a particular concept. Using a validated search filter could certainly help but the rapid growth of relevant literature and a lack of stable Subject Headings both mitigate against the reliability of this approach.",

In addition, databases may change their records and add, modify, or delete fields that necessitate changes to the syntax of search strategies. The need for living search strategies has always been there, but COVID-19 has brought this need into sharper focus. To date, there has been no open platform to develop living search strategies and search experts have become accustomed to writing searches using word processing programs and sharing them in text documents (e.g., spreadsheet or PDF) with all the limitations this implies [7].",
