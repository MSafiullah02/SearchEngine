The remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global, childhood, and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent, sexually transmitted, oncogenic, degenerative neurologic, potential bioterrorism, and miscellaneous other diseases. Historically, macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever, polio, and prion diseases. With rare exceptions (Chagas disease, bartonellosis), all of the infectious diseases in this review are of Old World origin. Perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical (16), newly emergent (7), and bioterrorism diseases (9) that have been modeled in macaques. Many of these human diseases (e.g., AIDS, hepatitis E, bartonellosis) are a consequence of zoonotic infection. However, infectious agents of certain diseases, including measles and tuberculosis, can sometimes go both ways, and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques. Through experimental studies in macaques, researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases, most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research, and particularly vaccinology, include influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, arenaviruses, hepatitis E virus, papillomavirus, smallpox virus, Mycobacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, and Plasmodium species.

The founders of the National Primate Research Centers could not have envisioned a more suitable example of the value of NHPs in biomedical research than that of simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) as a model for human AIDS 1 . SAIDS was initially (1983) (1984) (1985) the designation for a fatal immunosuppressive disease induced by an indigenous type D retrovirus in many macaques (Letvin and King 1984; Gardner et al. 1988 ). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV 1 ), a lentivirus closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1 ), was discovered in just a few macaques with immunosuppression and lymphomas at the New England center (Apetrei et al. 2005; Letvin et al. 1985) . SIV does not occur in Asian macaques in the wild, but was acquired in captive macaques by accidental or purposeful cross-species infection from sooty mangabeys or African green monkeys ). In their natural African hosts, which number about 36 different Cercopithecine species, SIV strains are asymptomatic and transmitted mainly through wounds or bites acquired in fights and through sexual contact. The major difference in the host-virus relationship between African monkeys and Asian macaques is the presence in the latter of a much stronger anti-SIV immune response associated with T and B cell activation and a loss of CD4 + T lymphocytes. In the different species of macaques tested, SIV (mainly of sooty mangabey origin) causes an AIDSlike disease with remarkable similarities to HIV-1/AIDS (Gardner et al. 2004; Letvin et al. 1985) . However, the SIV-induced macaque disease usually has a much shorter incubation period (2 months to 3 years) than does HIVinduced AIDS in humans. SIV from sooty mangabeys is also responsible for spreading by contact to humans in western Africa to cause HIV-2-associated AIDS, which is still largely confined to West Africa Hirsch et al. 1989) .

Hygienic food processing and storage remain the best preventive measures for both humans and nonhuman primates. Most human cases occur in immunocompromised individuals or as congenital infection, often leading to stillbirths. Various foodstuffs of vegetable or animal origin are the sources of infection. Cynomolgus macaques were used as a model for infection with L. monocytogenes, isolated from either humans or NHPs and administered orally (Farber et al. 1991) . Systemic infection was documented with the shedding of this bacterium in the feces for several weeks. Animals that received 10 9 bacteria suspended in sterile whole milk became ill with symptoms of septicemia, anorexia, and diarrhea. Given to pregnant macaques, the organism infected the fetus and caused stillbirths (Smith et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 606, "end": 626, "text": "(Farber et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 946, "end": 965, "text": "(Smith et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF411"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes)"}, {"text": "A rhesus macaque model of aerosol infection with the Legionella pneumophilia was established in 1983 .
