To date, it has resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774deaths.1 The causative agent was quickly identified as a previously unknown member of the Coronaviridae family.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 SARS infection of human beings has since been contained through infection-control measures. However, resurgence is still a threat because the causative agent remains in animal reservoirs that are not fully understood and sporadic cases continue to be reported. We have an incomplete understanding of the genesis of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and there may be the potential for the emergence of variants capable of greater transmissibility. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome that is a single strand of positive sense RNA of 30 kilobases or more in length. Sequence analysis of the RNA genome of the SARS coronavirus identified 11 open reading frames encoding proteins typical of coronaviruses, including the envelope spike (S) protein of the virus particle.5, 6, 7\n",

The prominent role of the respiratory tract in SARS transmission and disease suggest that direct immunisation of the respiratory mucosa would be an effective strategy for immunoprophylaxis against SARS. Furthermore, mucosal immunisation of the respiratory tract with live attenuated respiratory virus vaccines efficiently induces systemic as well as local immunity.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n",

The two forms of the S protein probably differ by the extent of glycosylation; based on the nucleotide sequence, the predicted full length unmodified S protein is 138 kDa and has 23 potential glycosylation sites.5, 6, 7 There was no evidence of proteolytic cleavage of the SARS S protein into two subunits, as occurs with some coronaviruses. Since the SARS-coronavirus S protein is a transmembrane virion component and BHPIV3 also is an enveloped virus, we wanted to determine whether the S protein was incorporated into BHPIV3 particles. Western blot analysis did not detect the S protein in purified, concentrated BHPIV3/SARS-S virus particles (figure 2A, lane 1) under conditions where direct Coomassie staining (figure 2B, lane 2) showed that viral protein was present in quantities greater than that required for detection by western blot.

Analysis of the tracheal lavage samples, a measure of shedding from the lower respiratory tract, showed that two of the four animals infected with BHPIV3/SARS-S did not have detectable virus shedding, whereas the other two showed some shedding at 2 days but this was less than for the BHPIV3/Ctrl-immunised animals (table 1). Thus, expression of the SARS S protein had an attenuating effect on the replication of the vector, particularly in the lower respiratory tract. Nevertheless, BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/Ctrl each induced a moderate titre of HPIV3-specific antibodies as measured by an HAI assay (table 1). In addition, BHPIV3/SARS-S induced a detectable level of serum antibodies that neutralised SARS-S coronavirus in vitro (mean reciprocal titre of 3\u00b79 log2).",

This difference in immunogenicity might reflect the natural restriction of HPIV3 to the respiratory tract, whereas SARS coronavirus disseminates systemically, at least in non-human primates.8, 9 There was no evidence of immune-mediated enhancement of infection or disease, which occurs for one coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus.23 Thus, our results show that one mucosal immunisation with vectored SARS S protein was sufficient to protect against shedding after a large challenge dose of SARS coronavirus.",

Of the three, African green monkeys supported the highest levels of replication as measured by virus shedding and hence were used in this study. None of the 12 animals in any of the three species developed overt disease signs, and we did not note disease signs in this study. Mice, ferrets, and cats have been shown to support high levels of pulmonary SARS-coronavirus replication, and some of the infected ferrets became lethargic.25, 20 We did not assess BHPIV3/SARS-S in mice because the HPIV3 vaccine vector is severely restricted for replication in this animal, and the cat and ferret models were only recently reported. Thus, although our study showed complete protection against shedding of challenge virus, we could not assess whether protection would be afforded against clinical disease signs. This study limitation is not unusual. With respect to human viruses, experimental animals rarely provide faithful models of the infection and disease that is observed in humans, and disease signs often are minimal, altered, or absent. The measurement of infectious challenge virus in secretions or other samples from experimental animals is a general standard for measuring the efficacy of viral vaccines. The assessment of an experimental vaccine in a non-human primate is especially important in view of the phylogenetic and anatomical similarity to humans, and is an appropriate last step before clinical trials.",
