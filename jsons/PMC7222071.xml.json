            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is one of the most important communicable infectious diseases worldwide. It presents a great threat to public health in China and abroad [1, 2]. Since the first domestic HIV-1 outbreak was detected among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the city of Ruili in Yunnan Province in 1989 [3], China has made great efforts toward controlling and preventing this disease. Following the country\u2019s social and economic development and the implementation of policies regarding blood donation, the primary transmission routes of HIV-1 in China have shifted from blood donation and injection drug use (IDU) to hetero- or homosexual activity [2]. There are about 1.3 million people infected with HIV-1 as of December 31, 2018, in China, and the number of newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases has increased rapidly in recent years [4, 5]. A major feature of HIV-1 is its high level of molecular polymorphism, which is due to its high replication rate and the lack of proofreading activity in its reverse transcriptase. At present, more than 10 subtypes of HIV, which can be divided into groups M, N, and O, have been reported worldwide [6]. The distribution of different subtypes has been found to exhibit geographic-specific patterns. HIV-1 subtype B is widespread globally, especially in Europe and the United States, but it only accounts for approximately 10% of HIV infections in the other parts of the world [7]. In China, an increased frequency of recombinant strains has been observed nationwide [8].",

However, the emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) due to natural and drug-induced selection poses as a great challenge for successful ART [10]. Previous studies have demonstrated that genotypic resistance is frequently associated with the failure of ART [11\u201313]. HIV-1 drug resistance can also be transmitted to another person. The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in North America and western Europe ranges from 4% to 20% [14\u201316]. Drug resistance testing is widely used in clinical practice to guide rational drug use. The HIV-1 pol gene is generally used to identify mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase (RT) or protease (PR) inhibitors and for HIV-1 subtyping [17]. Genetic typing of HIV-1 strains is important because different subtypes exhibit different patterns of drug resistance and treatment responses [18].",

Data about the patient's general condition, transmission route, HIV-1 RNA level, CD4+ T-cell count, and history of ART were collected. Blood samples were collected into EDTA-containing tubes, and plasma samples were prepared by centrifugation. The HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) in the plasma samples was determined using a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) RNA Quantitative Diagnostic Kit (Northeast Pharmaceutical Group, Shenyang, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol [20\u201322]. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using magnetic beads, and real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR detection of HIV-1 was performed by a TaqMan probe method. An internal standard was used to detect the presence of PCR inhibitors in the samples to avoid false-negative results.",

An HIV-1 pol gene sequence including the protease gene and part of the reverse transcriptase gene was reverse transcribed, amplified, and sequenced as described previously, with modifications [23, 24]. Briefly, the HIV-1 pol gene was reverse transcribed using the specific primer R5073 and a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The target sequence (approximately 1,300 bp) was amplified by nested PCR using LA Taq\u2122 Version 2.0 (Takara, Shiga, Japan) with two primer sets (PRO-F1 and RT-R1 for first-round PCR and PRO-F2 and RT-R2 for second-round PCR). Each amplified fragment was sequenced with two primer sets (CF1, CF3, CR2, and CR4 as the primary sequencing primer set; CF2, CF4, CR1, and CR3 as the backup sequencing primer set) (Table 1). For analysis of drug resistant mutations and antiretroviral susceptibility, sequences were submitted to the Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/), which undergoes frequent updates.",

Unfortunately, this has inevitably led to drug resistance after long-term treatment [33]. Drug resistance not only leads to failure of treatment but also poses a risk of transmission of drug-resistant strains, which can occur by different routes [14]. Previous studies have demonstrated transmission of viruses with resistance to drugs from one or more classes (multidrug resistance) [34\u201337]. No large-scale HIV-1 drug resistance tests have been conducted in Henan Province, and the demand from patients and clinicians is urgent. Under such circumstances, we adopted an in-house method to conduct HIV-1 drug resistance tests. Alongside drug resistance profiles, HIV-1 subtypes were also analyzed in this study due to their importance in pathogenesis, vaccine development, transmission, disease progression, and treatment response [18, 38].",

Genotyping analysis indicated that subtype B was the dominant subtype among all subjects, which is consistent with a previous report [39]. The dominant subtypes shifted to CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC when only treatment-na\u00efve patients were considered. This phenomenon may be explained by possible immigrant-mediated transmission, as the CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains are dominant in other provinces (e.g., Guangdong, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Gansu), and CRF01_AE was not found in Henan Province before 2006 [40].",

This difference may be due to the dominance of subtype B, the large proportion of older patients, the longer duration of medication regimens, and the greater number of patients with advanced HIV/AIDS disease. Most ART-experienced HIV-1 patients in our study were infected through illicit blood and plasma donation in the mid-1990s and have since then been on medication. Genotype B has been the dominant subtype since the epidemic in Henan Province, and natural evolution and selection of drug-resistant mutants due to poor compliance and limited drug diversity in the early days of treatment may have led to severe drug resistance within this genotype. NNRTI resistance mutations were dominant in our study, while NRTIs dominated in Yunnan and Guangxi [39]. This difference may have been due to differences in subtype distribution, because HIV DRMs are subtype-specific [43, 44]. One previous study showed that some NNRTI resistance mutations could significantly increase the replication capacity of subtype B strains [45]. This may be the reason why NNRTI resistance mutations were more common than NRTI resistance mutations in Henan Province. The proportion of drug resistance mutants varied significantly among the different subtypes derived from treatment-na\u00efve patients, with the largest proportion in subtype B (17.7%, 11/62), followed by CRF01_AE (4.29%, 3/70), and CRF07_BC (1.43%, 1/70). This is consistent with the history of the HIV epidemic in Henan Province and may be due to the transmission of drug resistance [46].",

Subtype B predominates, but with a gradually decreasing percentage, suggesting that the previously most common route of HIV-1 infection, illicit blood donation, has been brought under control to a certain extent and that more attention should be paid to emerging groups, such as those infected by MSM and HSX. Nationwide, free drug resistance testing is financially supported by the government and only covers patients who have exhibited clinical signs of drug resistance. The rate of drug resistance in treatment-na\u00efve patients has reached a moderate level, and drug resistance testing should be considered mandatory before initiating ART in such patients.",
