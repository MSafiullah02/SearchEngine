As a result, the lung is frequently exposed to injurious stimuli (including viral pathogens, e-cigarette vapors, and airborne pollutants, to name a few) that damage the epithelium and challenge it to repeatedly and efficiently repair itself so as to avoid disruption of the lung\u2019s critical gas-exchange function.",

            "text": "Early work in lung epithelial stem cell biology led to the identification and characterization of several important regional epithelial stem cell types that maintain the mouse lung during homeostasis and contribute to lung repair. These include basal cells in the trachea that self-renew and differentiate into luminal secretory and ciliated cells (Rock et al., 2009), Secretoglobin 1a1 (SCGB1A1)-positive club cells in the airway epithelium that self-renew and differentiate into ciliated cells (Rawlins et al., 2009), and Surfactant protein C (SFTPC)-positive type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) that self-renew and differentiate into type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1s) in the gas-exchanging epithelium in the alveolar space (Barkauskas et al., 2013). However, with time, we have developed a more nuanced understanding of these populations and the field now identifies subsets within the regional populations (Figure 1\n). For example, in the trachea, subsets of basal cells have been shown to contribute to repair following an injury (Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015). In the distal airway epithelium, a few, localized bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) that co-express SFTPC and SCGB1A1 (Liu et al., 2019) and a rare group of p63-expressing cells (Vaughan et al., 2015) both contribute to repair of the airways and alveolar space. Similarly, a subset of Wnt-responsive AEC2s have been shown to be facultative progenitors within the alveolar epithelium, capable of expansion and contributing to a large proportion of alveolar repair following lung injury (Nabhan et al., 2018, Zacharias et al., 2018).",

The authors demonstrate the regenerative potential of these H2-K1high cells through in vitro organoid and in vivo transplantation assays, revealing that this specific subset accounts for the regenerative capacity of the airway epithelium in alveolar repair. In the absence of lineage tracing tools to track this cellular subset after injury, the authors relied upon RNA velocity analysis to suggest that H2-K1high cells give rise to both AEC2s and AEC1s in the alveolar space as well as ciliated and club cells in the airway. Interestingly, these H2-K1high cells seem to be heterogeneous themselves, as the clonal organoids derived from individual cells were either basal or alveolar. The factors that contribute to the final fate choice decision in this cell population have not yet been uncovered.",

(2020) supports the notion that lung repair is modulated by expansion of pre-specified or committed progenitors. However, until we have the tools to rigorously lineage-trace, deplete, and/or genetically modify this H2-K1high cell population at specific times in the context of different levels of injury, we will not have definitive proof that they are permanently programmed to their fate or proof of whether there is natural cycling of Scgb1a1+ airway cells to adopt this H2-K1high identity and function.",

First, the authors suggest these H2-K1high cells have enhanced susceptibility to direct viral infection, perhaps explaining the abnormal alveolar epithelial repair following severe injury from influenza (Vaughan et al., 2015). Depletion of this highly regenerative cellular subset with concomitant alveolar injury could potentially contribute to the development and pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with infection with viruses with significant distal lung epithelial tropism, such as influenza and potentially the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).",

This suggests that the H2-K1high population has limited expansion and repair capacity in the long term. This could perhaps explain why some individuals develop non-resolving ARDS and why others develop chronic abnormal alveolar remodeling (as in fibrosis). As the authors suggest, the opportunity to transplant \u201cfresh\u201d H2-K1high cells (assuming a human correlate is identified) into patients\u2019 lungs at times of depletion could represent a novel therapeutic strategy. To move in this direction, there is a clear need to look for and study correlates of the H2-K1high population in human lung. Our field is only beginning to recognize epithelial stem cell subsets in human lung, and to date, it has been difficult to identify direct correlates of distinct murine lung stem cell subsets in human tissue.",
