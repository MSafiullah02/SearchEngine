            "text": "Oxidative stress is caused by excessive free radicals when the body encounters various external damages or stimulations. Highly active and unstable molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species have a strong oxidation effect. Multiple organ dysfunction and failure are caused by excessive free radicals or the decreased ability of scavenging free radicals[1,2]. Many diseases can cause oxidative stress and accumulation of free radicals, which lead to lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, changes in its permeability, and damage to structural proteins; they react with intracellular nucleic acids and cause cell death, such as in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[3]. When the accumulation of free radical molecules greatly exceed the body\u2019s ability to scavenge, the oxidation and antioxidant system become disordered, further leading to tissue damage and serious diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and neurological disease. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are especially effective on anti-oxidation on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity, which has the advantages of high efficiency and low toxicity. Therefore, Chinese herbal medicine has become one of the focuses in the field of research.",

It is composed of Astragalus mongholicus, Atractylodes macrocephalaKoidz. and Saposhnikovia divaricata (Trucz.) Schischk. Studies on the ratio of A. mongholicus, A. macrocephala and S. divaricata are diverse. The ratio 3:1:1 is documented in the Pharmacopoeia of People\u2019s Republic of China. A. mongholicus is traditionally used to improve immunity. Pharmacological experiments showed that A. Radix, the dry roots of Astragalus mongholicus Bge. [A. membranaceus Bge. var.mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao] and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, and immunoregulatory [4]. The use of Astragalus species can be dated back to more than two millenniums [5]. This species contains many components, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids were discovered as antioxidant constituents from the roots of A. mongholicus which can scavenge free radicals. Rhizoma A. macrocephala (baizhu in Chinese) has been used as a TCM for approximately 2,000 years [6]. Its polysaccharide has remarkable antioxidant activity and can improve the immune response in chickens [7]. Thus, it is widely used in the breeding industry in China as a feed additive. S.divaricata (Trucz.) Schischk, an umbelliferous genus, has been ranked as a top-grade herb by the Pharmacopoeia of People\u2019s Republic of China which was reported that S. divaricata has obvious anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anti-viral, and anti-oxidant effects on its free radical scavenging activity, and analgesic effects [8,9].",

The extract at 1 mL was placed in a 10 mL volumetric flask and added with 0.l mL of AlCl3 (1 mL). Ethanol solution (60%) was used for volume determination and blending. The absorbance of the mixture was measured against a blank at 415 nm after 15 min. The total flavonoid concentration was calculated using the following linear equation on the basis of the calibration curve (Fig. 2\n):(3) y=0.0246x+0.0174, R2=0.9993where y is the absorbance and x is the total flavonoid concentration. A linear relationship between 10 and 22 ug/mL is good. The total flavonoid content was calculated as:(4)Total flavonoids contentmgg=c\u00d7a\u00d7vmwhere c is the total flavonoid concentration in the sample solution, a is the dilution factor of the sample solution at the time of determination, v is the total volume of the sample solution, and m is the weight of medicinal materials.",

DPPH is a free radical with relative stability and could attract electrons from antioxidant [23] or hydrogen atoms. Thus, the determination of DPPH free radical scavenging activity is based on the reduction of DPPH ethanol solution in the presence of hydrogen supplying antioxidants which form the non-free radical form of DPPH-H because of the formation of stable molecules. The assay could accommodate many samples in a short period and is sensitive enough to detect active ingredients at low concentrations [24]. In the present study, the free radical scavenging capacities of antioxidant compounds present in extracts were determined to measure their hydrogen donating ability against reactive nitrogen (DPPH radical) species. The concluded that the compatibility of the two had a synergistic effect. MYP exhibited a synergistic antioxidant action in vitro (Fig. 3). Most antioxidants protect the organisms through redox reaction by inhibiting the generation of oxygen anions and scavenging free radicals. Lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction of free radical formation in the lipid parts of cellular membranes induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and/or Cu2+ ions. Flavonoids protect the membrane from the damage and destruction of lipid molecules; suppressed H2O2\u2212 provokes changes in cell membrane elasticity and its morphological properties [25]. Flavonoids scavenge free radicals, inhibit the lipid peroxidation induced by hydroxyl radicals, and reduce the transmission of automatic oxidation chain reaction to exert antioxidant effect on the body and protect the structure and function of cell membrane [25]. Polysaccharides can act as electron or hydrogen donors to scavenge hydroxyl radicals [26]. They can also directly remove ROS and complex the metal ions necessary for the ROS production to achieve the antioxidant effect of the organisms. In the present study, MYP could significantly improve the antioxidant function in mice (Fig. 4). The antioxidant activity of FSI and YPS was probably through the polysaccharides and total flavonoids, and their combination could contribute to the easy dissolution and absorption of the effective ingredients. The total flavonoids in S. japonica have antioxidant and renal protective functions [20,27], and rutin could protect against ultraviolet B radiation through the alteration of microRNA expression [28].",

SOD, GSH-Px and catalase (CAT) are important antioxidant enzymes that can adjust the balance in biological systems [31].ROS are balanced by the antioxidative defense system, which include SOD, CAT and GSH-Px under normal conditions. When an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants occurs, oxidative stress is reached [32]. SOD and GSH-Px protect the cell from oxidative damage by removing excessive MDA and ROS [33].

The mechanism of COVID-19 is organ damage caused by a large amount of free radicals produced by an extreme immune response [3,36]. YPS could prevent and cure influenza virus [37]; it has been recognized as a promising antiviral drug against RNA viruses (including influenza virus) [38]. YPS inhibits the replication of influenza virus and inactivates the virus [39]. Rutin could inhibit influenza virus by affecting the monooxygenase activity [40], and it is widely found in flavonoids. MYP may resist COVID-19 by scavenging free radicals and improving the antioxidant activity of the body to protect the tissues. Therefore, the combination of YPS and FSI may be used to treat viral infections on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity.",
