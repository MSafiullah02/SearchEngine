This finding has been reported in a previous study in which dogs vaccinated with a subunit vaccine containing serovars Pomona and Grippotyphosa developed the highest MAT titers to serogroup Autumnalis.\n8\n In our study, we also identified vaccinated dogs that developed highest titers to the nonvaccinal serogroup Bratislava. MAT titers against serogroup Bratislava were not evaluated in the previous study.\n8\n Our study provides further evidence that leptospirosis subunit vaccines may produce immune responses that are not serogroup specific when measured by the MAT. Another potential explanation is contamination of the antigens in the MAT test with additional serogroups, but this is unlikely because highest titers were found to nonvaccinal serogroups at multiple VDLs. It is also possible that the vaccine used in the study was contaminated with antigens from serogroups Autumnalis and Bratislava, but this is also unlikely given the requirements for vaccine manufacturers to frequently submit type cultures to federal agencies for confirmatory analysis.\n8\n\n",

This relatively high percentage of tied results from the MAT also confounds interpretation of the potential infecting serogroup. For the purposes of this study, when >1 serogroup was recorded as having the highest titer, these were considered to be different among VDLs if at least one of the serogroups was different. This approach was chosen because most clinicians will only submit titers to a single VDL. If the results report that the highest titer is against >1 serogroup, it is usually assumed that the infecting serogroup is one of the ones with the highest titer, but it cannot be definitively identified. Thus, a result of the same and highest titers to serogroups Grippotyphosa and Autumnalis could be ascribed to infection with serogroups Grippotyphosa or Autumnalis, whereas a result of the same and highest titers to serogroups Grippotyphosa and Pomona could result from infection with serogroups Grippotyphosa or Pomona. When looking at results from multiple VDLs, as in this study, a different interpretation may be made. For example, for the initial MAT results in dog 14, Grippotyphosa was one of the tied highest serogroups at all of the VDLs to which samples were submitted. Thus, it might be concluded that Grippotyphosa was the infecting serogroup in this case. However, there is no published evidence to support this assumption.",
