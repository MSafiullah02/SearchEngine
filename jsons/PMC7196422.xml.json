            "text": "Newcastle Disease is a panzootic disease which affects the avian species. It is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belonging to the Avulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is an enveloped virus having linear, non-segmented single-stranded RNA of negative polarity [1]. Based on the genome size, strains of NDV are classified into 3 groups having 15186, 15192, and 15198 nucleotides [2], [3], [4], [5]. The genome of NDV has six transcriptional units, comprising nucleocapsid protein (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), fusion protein (F), haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), and large polymerase protein (L) from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. The N and P, along with L, forms an RNA polymerase complex for the viral genome replication [6].",

Furthermore, based on the tissue tropism, it can be further classified as viscerotropic velogenic, which produces lethal haemorrhagic lesions in the viscera and neurotropic velogenic that cause respiratory and neurological disorders [8]. The clinical signs of the infection vary depending on the virus, host species, the age of the host, infection with other organisms, environmental stress, and immune status. The average incubation time of the virus is 15-21 days and can be transmitted easily, causing significant loss to the poultry industry [9]. It can cause a substantial economic loss by reduced egg production and the death of the ailing birds. There are live, inactivated, and vectored vaccines that are available for the prevention of the disease in poultry [10], [11]. Among these, the traditional live vaccines such as LaSota, B1, and VG/GA strains are commonly used in the endemic areas [12], [13]. However, vaccine failures have been frequently reported due to the emergence of its variant strains [14]. There is no available drug against NDV; the reason why the development of the antiviral drug is of prime importance.",

            "text": "Nitazoxanide (NTZ), also known as 2-(acetyloxy)-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl) benzamide is a commercially available antiprotozoal drug which was initially developed for the cure of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis [15]. NTZ has also been classified as a broad-spectrum first-class antiviral compound against the respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Sendai virus, coronavirus, rotavirus, and norovirus infection [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Additionally, NTZ has been shown to inhibit hepatitis viruses [21], [22], flaviviruses [23], [24], [25], chikungunya virus [26], human immunodeficiency virus [27] and vaccinia virus [28]. Clinical trials are under progress for the use of NTZ against influenza and its subtypes [29], [30]. Several mechanisms of action have been suggested for NTZ mediated viral inhibition. It can curtail influenza virus replication by inhibiting the maturation of hemagglutinin protein [29]. In the Sendai virus, the active metabolite of NTZ acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of ER-resident proteins to misfold the F protein and halts its trafficking towards the plasma membrane [17]. The reduction in the size of viroplasm was observed against rotavirus, which led to a decrease in the formation of dsRNA [31]. As an anti-hepatitis C compound, NTZ was shown to activate protein kinase R (PKR), resulting in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2-\u03b1) [32]. NTZ blocks the replication of bovine viral diarrhoea virus by causing stress in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to depletion of ATP sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores [33]. However, the effect of NTZ on NDV biology has not been addressed to date. The present study reports the inhibition of NDV upon NTZ treatment on chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), embryonated chicken eggs, and two-week old chickens.",

Growth kinetics was performed to monitor the release of NDV progeny, which showed complete inhibition of NDV post NTZ treatment until 96 h (Figure 2c). It was observed that in other conditions of pre and co-treatment, the NDV replication in the initial time points was less but later became equal to the NDV control. The results obtained in the growth kinetics of NDV were further corroborated by plaque assay. In pre-treatment of NTZ, approximately 30% of NDV reduction was observed. The reduction of NDV in the post-treatment of NTZ was found to be 65% (Figures 2d and 2e), whereas it was not significant in the co-treatment conditions.

            "text": "Newcastle disease is an economically important disease, causing substantial loss to the poultry industry. The recommended strategy for the prevention of the disease is by using killed or live attenuated vaccines. Vaccination failure is a common problem and has been reported from places where the velogenic strains of NDV are endemic [10], [39], [40]. An alternative to this problem is the use of antiviral drugs against NDV, which is not commercially available. NTZ is a licensed drug for the treatment of diarrhoea induced by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis\n[15], [41]. NTZ has also been used as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug [16], [42]. The present study is an attempt to repurpose NTZ as an antiviral against NDV infection. The IC50 value of NTZ in the chicken fibroblast cells was found to be \u223c60 \u03bcM in 48 h. The cytotoxic concentration that reduced the exponential growth in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was earlier reported as 18.59 \u03bcg/ml (60.4 \u03bcM) [24], which is as per the IC50 value reported in our study.",

The significant reduction in the viral genes further confirmed the blocking of viral replication. Effect of NTZ against rubella virus replication has been previously reported showing the reduction of RNA transcription of viral genes [43]. We found a reduction in the expression of viral genes in accordance with the earlier report; however, further experimentation is required to understand whether NTZ blocks the transcription of mRNA or whether the reduced gene expression is due to lower infectivity. Our data suggested a decrease in viral structural and non-structural proteins post-NTZ treatment, which could perhaps have perturbed the effective assembly of the NDV virion in the cytoplasm. Earlier reports suggested inhibition of enveloped viruses by downregulating the structural and non-structural proteins [24], [42]. However, we did not get an appreciated protein level post 24 h of NDV infection, which could be due to a lesser viral protein that falls below the detection threshold.",

Our results showed significant up-regulation in TLR7 and type I interferons, along with few other cytokines such as IL18 and IL-1\u03b2. Out of all reported TLRs in birds, TLR7 has been reported to reduce the avian influenza replication [46]. TLR7, which induces the type I interferon production, might play a role in reducing the NDV infection [47]. Type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines are shown to modulate virus replication [48]. Our results showed significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3, and IL18 at the transcription level. Furthermore, NTZ treatment upregulated type I interferons suggesting that the innate immune modulation could help effectively to clear the NDV from the host. However, the effect could be appreciated only at the level of transcription due to the unavailability of chicken specific antibodies. A significant reduction of the virus in NTZ treated groups was observed as compared to non-treated infected birds. The pre-treatment group was found to be the most effective NTZ treated group. Decreased viral replication in the trachea and lungs indicates that NTZ is more effective by enhancing the immune system for the rapid clearance of the virus. Spleen did not show any virus even in the virus control group suggesting that the virus spreads only in trachea and lungs.",
