They are classified by their number of sugar units: monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose), and disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) are simple carbohydrates; oligosaccharides and polysaccharides (such as starch, glycogen and cellulose) are complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play a crucial role in diverse biological systems [Hricov\u00edn M. Structural aspects of carbohydrates and the relation with their biological properties. Curr Med Chem 2004;11:2565-83]. According to Roseman [Sugars of the cell membrane. In: Weissmann G, Clairborn E, editors. Cell membranes. Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Pathology. New York: H. P. Publ. Co; 1975. p. 55-64], two classes of glycoproteins are described. Free glycoproteins are localised in the surface coat of the membranes and form a thick mobile layer, without any association to the membrane itself. Functionally, however, they are located in a close association with the membrane (e.g. in the duodenal mucosa). The other group consists of the membrane glycoproteins, which are integral to the membranes and are located in the outer layer. The oligosaccharide chains are bound to the N-terminal part of proteins, and are situated in the hydrophilic zone. Glycoproteins have diverse functions. They are important in specific receptor functions, in immunological cell destruction and play a significant role in reactions with lectins, antibodies, as well as in cell association and mutual recognition of the cells. This paper focuses on aspects of a summary of polarisation optical investigations and biological functions of the following three groups of carbohydrates: oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The functional significance of carbohydrates in biology is a topic of intense current research.

The starch granules, when unstained, have a high anisotropy and are linear negative (radially positive spherulites); therefore, the hexose molecules in starch granules are oriented opposite to those in cellulose. In starch granules, the hexose molecules are oriented radially and show a high intensity of anisotropy. This indicates a similar orientation of amylose and amylopectin in starch granules (Frey-Wyssling, 1953) .
