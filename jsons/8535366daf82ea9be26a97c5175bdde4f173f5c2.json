The objectives of this study were to determine whether people with occupational contact with dogs were more likely to have antibodies against canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) compared to persons with no dog exposure. A seroepidemiological cohort study was completed, for which 302 canine-exposed and 99 non-canine-exposed study subjects enrolled in the study by providing a serum sample and completing a selfadministered questionnaire. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect human antibodies against CRCoV while controlling for cross-reacting antibodies against the human coronavirus OC43. All study subjects were negative for antibodies against CRCoV by this competitive ELISA.

Serologic results for human antibodies against canine respiratory coronavirus based on optical density (OD) readings between exposed and non-exposed study groups This study had a number of limitations. A key limiting factor was the inherently imperfect nature of serological assays. By design, antibodies are not rigidly specific. Infection with one virus or bacterium can render a person immune to attack by a closely related pathogen, thus reducing the incidence of infections. Although fortuitous in nature, this can present a difficult obstacle in serological diagnoses.
