The outbreak lasted from May 2015 to Dec. 2015 and resulted in 186 infected patients within the initial 2 months, 16,693 officially isolated individuals, and an overall mortality of 38 patients in a total of 50 million population [2]. Acute infectious outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) are known to influence the physical as well as the mental health of affected patients, as observed during similar events such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak [3], which was associated with such issues during the acute phase [4] and the long-term follow-up phase [5, 6]. 35% of 425 survivors expressed anxiety or depressive symptoms at 1-month post-SARS in Hong Kong where 1755 citizens were infected, and its fatality was 17.0% [4]. In ninety survivors\u2019 cohort study for 30 months in Hong Kong, post-SARS cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders was 58.9%. The most common diagnoses were PTSD (25.6%) and depression (13.3%) [5].",

Another study reported that 7.6% of 1656 isolated individuals exhibited anxiety symptoms and that 16.6% of this group reported feelings of anger during the isolation period [8]. In contrast, anxiety was present in 47.2% of MERS patients [8], which was more prevalent than the rate of anxiety in isolated people without the MERS-CoV infection. Compared to patients with other diseases, those with EIDs may experience greater suffering in terms of the physical and psychiatric symptoms of the infectious illness itself [9]; extreme fear and anxiety due to their unfamiliarity with the disease, which may be life-threatening [10]; abrupt isolation from family and society during the illness [8]; stigma due to the infectious disease [11]; the unexpected death of a family member; and/or social impairments [12].",

Of 148 MERS survivors who were eligible, 73 consented to participate in the study initially when they were contacted by phone and mail at 6 months post-MERS (Fig. 1). Of these participants, 69 survivors completed the 12-month assessment that consisted of medical tests between June 2016 and August 2016. Among them, 63 participants provided consent to participate in the psychological assessments in five tertiary hospitals: National Medical Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Chungnam National University Hospital, Seoul Medical Center, and Dankook University Hospital. All subjects were older than 19 years of age at enrollment, voluntarily participated in the study, and answered the questionnaires independently. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each study hospital.\n",

This questionnaire contains eight items rated on a four-point Likert-type scale that ranges from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d and assesses the four domains of stigma: personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, negative self-image, and concerns with public attitudes; the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 in the present study was 0.919. The present study also included the Brief COPE, which is a 28-item questionnaire that uses a four-point Likert scale to measure three distinctive coping strategies: emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional [24]. The social support systems of participants were assessed with the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) [25], which includes 19 items that are scored on a scale from 0 to 100 and assesses emotional/information support, tangible support, positive social interactions, and affectionate support. To examine the impact of social support on mental health in a regression analysis, poor social support was defined as a MOS-SSS score lower than that of the 25th percentile for all participants.",

This indicates that an EID is not only a serious medical illness but also a psychologically traumatic experience for patients that can result in long-term psychological burdens. Additionally, the result suggests that mental health problems caused by an EID outbreak can continue for a long period. For example, another study showed that 42.5% of SARS survivors in Hong Kong still showed active psychiatric illnesses at 3 years post-SARS infection [31]. Furthermore, a second study demonstrated that 42% of Chinese SARS survivors still experienced PTSD at 4 years post-SARS [13]. Assuming that the experiences of the patients in the MERS outbreak are similar in terms of EIDs, the mental health problems of the MERS survivors in the present study may persist for longer than 12 months. Therefore, a study on mental health outcomes after 12 months post-MERS will be required.",

On the other hand, high anxiety levels, perceived stigma about MERS, and having a family member who died from MERS predicted the development of PTSD or depression. These findings indicate that the psychological outcomes associated with an EID are mainly affected by factors during the outbreak period. Furthermore, the presence of a physical illness prior to the MERS-CoV infection and the severity of MERS were not associated with PTSD or depression. Thus, psychosocial factors, rather than medical factors, may play an important role during MERS-CoV infection in terms of mental health status. These findings differ from those of a study investigating SARS survivors at 30 months post-infection, which found that the risk factors of PTSD included being female, the pre-SARS presence of chronic medical illness, and the presence of complications caused by SARS treatment [32]. It is possible that the relatively small sample size of the present study was insufficient to statistically identify the influences of demographic characteristics and medical severity on adverse psychological outcomes. However, psychological burdens, such as widespread and extreme fear or feelings of isolation caused by MERS [7], may have outweighed the possible contributions of these other factors. A previous report showing that only a history of mental disease and financial burden are related to anxiety in MERS patients [8] supports this assumption.",

Interestingly, on our univariate analysis, we can assume that negative coping strategy such as denial, substance use, and self-blame may affect the development of PTSD. This relationship between negative coping style and PTSD is consistent with the previous findings in natural disaster and infectious disease [33, 34].

In general, during the early outbreak phase, it is important that effective risk communication is incorporated into the overall strategy to reduce fear among the general public and quarantined people [35]; when developing such a strategy for this phase, it is also important to consider the ethical issues related to patients and quarantined people to minimize stigma [36]. More specifically, due to the high prevalence of mental health problems, routine care for EID patients should include effective psychological support that reflects individual risk factors and the current level of distress. In fact, the central and local Korean governments provided psychological support for quarantined people, patients, and families who had a member die from MERS using designated public mental health care centers and telephone counseling during the outbreak [1]. The core value associated with this program was adequate public accessibility; indeed, rather than rely on the passive provision of information, the program was implemented in a proactive manner [37].",

In EID outbreak, the perspective is easily made that an infected patient is regarded as a dangerous vector or perpetrator to spread virus who should be isolated from the society [38]. It can be maintained even after the outbreak [39]. The stigma may produce discrimination and exclusion from a community regardless of medical indications. It would significantly threaten a patient\u2019s mental health and social relationship. Consequently, their life could be influenced in a variety of domains such as residence, occupation and the use of healthcare for a long time [40]. This study showed that reducing stigma can be an effective strategy to ameliorate psychological consequence after an EID. Media and government should respect a patient or quarantined people as a citizen who are suffering and be sensitive to words or actions that might stigmatize a specific person or group. A community and healthcare service need to provide active support for an isolated patient to relieve their burden from the stigma [41].",

Because this study assessed only 43% of the overall MERS survivors, the results may not reflect the status of all survivors. However, the distributions of the demographic data on age, gender, and area of residence in the present study were similar to those in the official reports for all MERS patients [1]. Second, psychological distress and stigma during the pre-MERS period and during the MERS-CoV infection were evaluated based on participant recall and may not accurately represent the actual status of the subjects. Additionally, the relatively small sample size may have limited the ability to identify risk factors due to low statistical power. However, given that 47.2% of 34 patients reported anxiety using the same scale in a previous study conducted during the isolation period [8], it can be assumed that the subjects in the present study were not likely to overestimate their symptoms during recall. Finally, we assessed only with self-questionnaire that could be considered less accurate than the ratings of a clinician.",
