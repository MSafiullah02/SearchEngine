Since their introduction in the 1940s, seasonal influenza vaccines have saved countless lives and limited pandemic spread. Influenza viruses nonetheless continue to evolve through genetic mutation and escape from natural immunity, and vaccines must be updated yearly. The protective efficacy of the current licensed vaccines varies each year (Fig. 1a), depending on the antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. The immune status of the host can also affect vaccine efficacy. For example, young and elderly individuals are more susceptible to the complications of influenza infection1\u20133.",

            "text": "Current licensed influenza vaccines contain either inactivated or live attenuated influenza viruses. Most inactivated vaccines consist of split viruses or subunit influenza antigens (Table 1). Split vaccines are produced by disrupting viral particles with chemicals or detergents and are widely used because of the ease of manufacture. Subunit vaccines contain viral haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins that are partially purified after chemical or detergent splitting37. The live-attenuated influenza vaccines are made from cold-adapted viruses that do not replicate well at body temperature and are administered intranasally. This type of vaccine induces strong local mucosal immunity but is only recommended for non-pregnant individuals between 2 and 49 years of age37. The HA content in the licensed vaccines must be determined and standardized, but the quantity and quality of NA can vary by vaccine and by manufacturing processes. The trivalent vaccine has viral components from two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain, whereas the quadrivalent vaccine formulations add an additional influenza B virus. The viruses chosen for the vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs; therefore the production heavily relies on a steady egg supply. Any modifications to viral protein must not impair influenza replication, which limits the repertoire of modified proteins that can be incorporated into a vaccine. Newer technology that utilizes cell culture for growing viruses has been developed, but the selected vaccine strains still need to be adapted for growth on cells, and the manufacturing cost remains high. More recently, a recombinant HA-based subunit vaccine produced from insect cells showed efficacy in healthy adults and improved protection in older subjects38.",

            "text": "Even though the development of a \u2018true\u2019 universal influenza vaccine remains a challenging goal, strategic plans have been proposed by field experts and government agencies4. Many steps have been taken towards improving current seasonal vaccines by expanding the breadth of protection within a subtype or across a group. They have shown progressive but incremental degrees of efficacy (Fig. 1c). For example, a high-dose, quadrivalent, inactivated vaccine is more effective than a standard dose vaccine at reducing the clinical outcomes associated with influenza infection46 and is now recommended for routine use in healthy elderly adults47, showing the benefits of a more highly effective, matched seasonal vaccine (Fig. 1c, strain-specific). An increase in protection against confirmed influenza-like illness has also been observed with a recombinant protein-based vaccine (FluBlok) and an adjuvanted vaccine (Fluad) in older adults38,48,49, likely through enhanced coverage of divergent subtypes beyond the matched vaccine strains (Fig. 1c, subtype-specific). In animal models, combinations of rationally selected H1 HA immunogens have been used to elicit broad and effective antibody responses, including one multivalent vaccine candidate that induced antibodies that neutralize diverse H1N1 viruses50, providing broader H1 or subtype-specific coverage (Fig. 1c, subtype-specific). Another approach to generate broader subtype-specific immune responses is to design \u2018consensus\u2019 sequences using computational algorithms51\u201356. One such antigen, termed \u2018computationally optimized, broadly reactive antigen\u2019 (COBRA), induces some cross-reactive antibodies within subtypes, such as H1, H3 or H5, in preclinical studies51,53,55. Another informatics approach involves computational analysis of influenza virus sequences and in silico design of synthetic HA antigens. Delivery of such \u2018mosaic\u2019 HA antigens in a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector conferred protection against diverse influenza viruses57,58. These studies suggest that development of a supra-seasonal vaccine that could cover multiple strains within each circulating subtype, and thereby protect against drifted influenza virus strains, is feasible.",

Seasonal vaccine manufacturers characterize their vaccine products, in part, by measuring and standardizing the quantity of each HA component of their vaccines. Recent advances in structural biology, including crystallography, electron microscopy and bioinformatics, have enabled a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the structure of HA, which has subsequently provided opportunity for vaccinologists to employ structure-guided vaccine design.",

HA mediates viral entry by binding to its receptor, terminal sialic acids on glycoproteins or glycolipids of host respiratory epithelial cells, and mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell in the endosome92. The molecular structures of HA from different subtypes have been determined. The overall architecture of HA from different strains is conserved, although the surface sequence composition and glycosylation patterns differ among influenza virus subtypes and types, especially in regions near or at the receptor binding site (RBS) localized in the globular head92. The RBS itself is a shallow pocket surrounded by three secondary elements, the 130-loop, 190-helix and 220-loop, with a base consisting of four highly conserved amino acid residues. In both H1 and H3 viruses, the number of N-linked glycosylation sites on the HA head increased after they entered the human population, and these modifications can contribute to \u2018antigenic drift\u2019 of the virus93,94. One example is the evolution of a pandemic H1N1 strain into a seasonal strain, during which it acquired two additional glycans near the RBS which effectively masked the respective antigenic regions from recognition by antibodies. Humoral responses to HA have been associated with protective immunity95. Antibodies directed to the head region of HA can be routinely elicited by viral infection and seasonal vaccination10,11,13,14,16\u201318,20,96,97. These antibodies provide immunity by blocking viral entry to host cells or preventing receptor-mediated endocytosis. Memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells are often found following infection or immunization to provide durable protection against matched or closely-related viruses. However, these antibodies tend to be strain-specific and do not neutralize drifted variants mainly due to the high mutation rate of the HA globular head, especially in regions around the RBS.",

The C179 monoclonal antibody, isolated in mice, displayed unusually broad specificity and neutralized many group 1 HA viruses, including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes32,98. Unlike most HA antibodies that recognize the highly variable HA head region, C179 binds to a conserved stem region of the HA. A follow-up study has also shown that heterosubtypic protective immunity can be induced by vaccination with an immunogen lacking the head domain99, suggesting that an HA stem-only immunogen could induce antibodies with more breadth. Subsequently, this class of antibodies was isolated from humans, and structures of several have been extensively characterized21\u201331,33\u201335. Broadly neutralizing antibodies, such as CR6261 and F10, cross-react with most group 1 influenza A HA subtype viruses24,33. Crystal structures of CR6261 and F10 in complex with HA revealed that both antibodies bind to a hydrophobic pocket on the stem near the fusion peptide with a very hydrophobic complementary domain region (CDR) H2 and use a conserved tyrosine residue in CDR H3 to stabilize the interaction with HA24,33. They inhibit the virus by fixing HA in its prefusion form, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion24,25 (Fig. 2a, right). Other stem-directed antibodies may inhibit proteolytic cleavage of HA21,25, prevent viral replication by disrupting particle egress100 or inhibit NA enzymatic activity through steric hindrance101,102.",

            "text": "Many of these stem-directed human antibodies were derived from the VH1-69 germline, but antibodies that utilize different germline families, such as VH1-18, VH6-1 and VH3-23, and additional neutralizing epitopes on the stem have also been identified28,103. Most stem-directed antibodies neutralize influenza strains within group 1 or group 2, but a few have been shown to neutralize across both groups within influenza A and at least one, CR9114, protects mice from both influenza A and influenza B virus challenge, although it binds but does not neutralize influenza B in vitro21\u201331,33\u201335. The generation of these broadly neutralizing antibodies by different vaccination platforms or immunogens in various animal models and in clinical trials has been demonstrated59,60,88,104\u2013107. Although these stem-directed antibodies are present in humans, most appear to be less prevalent in human sera and less potent neutralizers than those directed to the HA head region108,109. Several different approaches have been taken to overcome these challenges. Immunization of human subjects with pre-existing immunity to H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with pandemic vaccines that contain divergent head but conserved stem domains, such as H5N1 or H7N1, have been shown to induce stem-binding antibodies with limited neutralizing activity104,106. Priming with a novel pandemic H5N1 or H7N9 DNA vaccine followed by matched-strain monovalent inactivated virus vaccine boost has improved the breadth of immune response in animals and in clinical trials over monovalent inactivated virus vaccine alone59,60. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that neutralize both group 1 and group 2 influenza virus have indeed been isolated from vaccinees who received this regimen28,103. Another approach is sequential immunization with synthetic, chimeric HA in which the HA1 domain is derived from different, novel subtypes while the stem remains the same. Prime/boost immunization with chimeric HA generates cross-neutralizing antibodies and protects animals from heterologous viral challenge110\u2013113. These chimeric HA vaccines have been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial, and the interim analysis suggested that stem binding antibodies that react with select group 1 HA subtypes (H1, H2, H9 and H18), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, can be boosted in subjects with pre-existing anti-stem antibody titres, although neutralization was not evaluated114. Additionally, chimeric HA vaccines can also be constructed with exotic head domain sequences from avian species, allowing the potential for sequential immunization and repeated boosting of cross-reactive, stem-directed antibodies115\u2013117. More recently, two groups independently designed and engineered a \u2018headless\u2019 HA construct in which only the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions of HA1 and entire HA2 were presented118,119 (Fig. 2b). In one design, the HA stem was stabilized by a trimerization domain119, and in the other, the stem was fused and presented on a bacterial ferritin nanoparticle118,120. Both headless immunogens elicit heterosubtypic immunity and protect animals from a heterologous lethal H5N1 virus challenge. One is currently under evaluation in a phase I clinical trial121 (Table 2). Overall, these stem-based immunogens represent promising candidates for broadly protective vaccines and warrant further clinical investigation.",

An antibody that binds close to antigenic site B, C139/1, was first reported in 2009, and it neutralizes many influenza subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H5, H9 and H13)20. Many head-directed antibodies with varying degrees of specificity have subsequently been identified, and the majority of these antibodies tend to be subtype-specific10,11,13,14,16\u201318,20,96,97. They neutralize the virus by blocking viral attachment to the host cells and, in general, utilize the CDR loop to make minimum contact with the relatively small RBS. Antibodies directed against additional sites in the HA head located outside the RBS have recently been identified that do not mediate HAI but can mediate neutralization122\u2013124. Antibodies to conserved epitopes on the interface of the HA head trimer recognize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses and confer hetero-subtypic protection in mice dependent on Fc activity125,126. The challenge for vaccine design will be to present the minimum, most conserved residues in this binding pocket in a functional conformation, while avoiding the highly variable surrounding regions.",

            "text": "A recent study utilizing a human influenza challenge model suggested that serum neuraminidase inhibition activity may be more predictive of susceptibility to live virus challenge than the current standard predictor of protection, the HAI titre127\u2013129. NA is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 11 subtypes that fall into three genetic groups (Fig. 3a). This tetrameric protein removes terminal sialic acids and facilitates the release of newly formed viral particles130 (Fig. 3b). Although antibodies to NA have been identified131\u2013134, little is known about how they affect the outcome of influenza virus infection135. NA is a validated drug target as small-molecule inhibitors to NA, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and laninamivir, can modulate disease severity136. Recent identification and characterization of broadly protective antibodies that recognize the active site of NA suggest that these antibodies could potentially be induced by vaccines137. Antigenic drift and shift of NA is thought to occur independently of HA. As a result, N2 antibodies may have helped limit the severity of the H3N2 pandemic of 1968, in which the HA changed but the NA did not138. Although the potential importance of NA as an influenza immunogen was recognized at the time of that pandemic139,140, current seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturers are not required to measure the quantity or quality of NA in marketed products. Simply adding a known quantity of conformationally correct NA to current seasonal vaccines may improve efficacy and, potentially, breadth against drifted strains of influenza141,142. Additional efforts, such as the creation of \u2018consensus\u2019 NA immunogens, are being tested in animal models and may hold promise for using NA as a component of a more universal vaccine143.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) has been proposed as a universal vaccine antigen144,145, but M2e presents multiple challenges. Although the M2 ion channel is essential for influenza virus budding and disassembly of the viral core, and, thus, is highly conserved, its surface-exposed amino terminal ectodomain is poorly immunogenic146. If M2e is conjugated to various carriers or delivered as a virus-like particle, its immunogenicity improves147. In fact, IgG-mediated protection from a broad range of influenza virus strains has been demonstrated in animal models148. However, this protection derives from Fc effector functions, and no robust immune correlate of protection has been established149, which makes quantifying M2e-based immunity challenging and limits the measurement of vaccine efficacy to large field trials. A passively transferred human monoclonal antibody to M2e did decrease the viral load in a human influenza challenge model150. The immune response of M2e can be improved with adjuvants, and, in a phase I clinical trial, an M2e\u2013flagellin fusion protein vaccine induced strong antibody responses at high dose, although the systemic reactogenicity profile was unacceptable146. Given that M2e is a relatively small protein and viral escape mutants have been identified, it is more likely for an M2e-based vaccine to be used as an adjunct to HA-based vaccines to provide additional protective immunity, especially when there is a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating epidemic strains151.",

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been shown to be associated with heterosubtypic immunity against influenza154\u2013158. T cells have been implicated, both directly through CD8-mediated cytotoxicity and indirectly via CD4 help, in a breadth of protection in murine159 and non-human primate160 models of influenza infection. Although T cell-based immunity varies depending upon HLA type, and no absolute correlate of protection has yet been established, studies in humans have associated higher numbers of cross-reactive T cells with protection from influenza infection161,162. NP is an internal protein conserved across influenza A strains that has been identified as a target of T cell immunity and studied in early phase clinical trials. An MVA-vectored NP + M1 vaccine induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, detected by interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) enzyme-linked immunospot, across younger and older aged cohorts (Table 2). This vaccine also enhanced T cell and strain-specific antibody responses when used together with seasonal vaccines163,164. In an influenza challenge, MVA NP + M1-vaccinated individuals had lower symptom scores than unvaccinated controls, although the number of individuals studied was small66,165. As in the above-mentioned studies, viral-vectored and nucleic acid-based vaccine platforms have been found to induce improved T cell responses over traditional inactivated influenza vaccines in animal models and in a human influenza virus challenge59,60,166, and such alternative platforms may be required for a universal vaccine to effectively recruit T cells.",

Adjuvants are immunostimulatory agents that enhance the immunogenicity of the co-administered antigens. They can potentially provide other advantages, such as dose sparing, polarization of immune responses towards a more desirable response, acceleration of vaccine-induced immune response and increased immunogenicity in populations with poor immune responses, such as the elderly and patients who are immunosuppressed. Several adjuvants have been approved for use in influenza vaccines, including Alum, MF59, AS03 and AF03 (refs167,168). The most widely used vaccine adjuvant, aluminium salt, showed little effect when used with H1N1 or H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccines169,170. MF59, a squalene oil-in-water emulsion approved for influenza vaccines since 1997, increases antibody responses with both seasonal and pandemic subunit vaccines and has been shown to enhance protective efficacy against hospitalization associated with influenza171. Similar to MF59, both AS03 and AF03 are oil-in-water adjuvants containing squalene with similar proposed modes of action172\u2013174. Both AS03 and AF03 have been approved for pandemic influenza vaccines. In general, these adjuvants are safe and well tolerated, and improve both the potency and breadth of humoral immune responses. Other adjuvants have been tested in animal models and clinical trials, including saponins, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, polysaccharides and glycolipids. Saponins are amphipathic glycosides commonly found in plants, and a newer generation of saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-M, has advanced to a phase II trial and showed efficacy with an H7N9 virus-like particle vaccine175.",

A large enterprise and standardized practices have been established to support the $1.6 billion US market and estimated $4 billion global market187. The system involves semi-annual recommendations from the WHO (WHO: Influenza vaccine viruses and reagents), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collaborating centres for strain selection to include in vaccine formulations for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Vaccines are reformulated and manufactured annually in a process that involves millions of embryonic eggs, genetic reassortment, amplification of vaccine viruses, and worldwide distribution188. Numerous organizations devote substantial resources to surveillance, evaluation and recommendations on vaccine efficacy, safety and clinical use. Although this cumbersome and elaborate system is entrenched, it produces only a few hundred million doses for the world\u2019s 7 billion inhabitants, and vaccine efficacy is at best 60% in years when the vaccine viruses are well matched to circulating strains189. Nevertheless, the system is familiar, consistent, cost-effective and well understood, so displacing current practices is a significant hurdle for the development of new and potentially improved vaccine technologies.

HAI was originally developed in the 1950s as a surrogate for neutralization because the assay was rapid and easier to perform193. However, HAI depends on blocking access to the sialic acid binding pocket on the HA head. In most cases, antibodies with HAI activity are highly strain-specific.

Therefore, advancing universal influenza vaccines will likely require expensive field efficacy studies and, eventually, the development of other surrogate end points. For example, antigens targeting the HA stem, designed to elicit antibodies with broad cross-subtype recognition, will not induce HAI34. They will potentially induce neutralizing activity or Fc-mediated antibody functions that could be monitored194. Neutralizing activity is likely to be an acceptable surrogate for protection, as HAI was originally developed as a surrogate for neutralization, which is the mechanistic correlate being assessed by HAI. Other mechanisms of neutralization beyond blocking receptor binding have also been recognized195,196. Therefore, although HAI is sufficient for strain-specific protection because it reflects neutralization through blocking receptor interaction, HAI is not required for protection, and so induction of broad neutralizing activity could be a better surrogate marker of immunity against diverse influenza strains. Another reason to focus on neutralizing activity instead of HAI is the continuous change in genetics and antigenicity of influenza viruses. For example, as H3N2 viruses evolve glycosylation patterns on HA, receptor binding or NA agglutination of red blood cells often changes, making it difficult to characterize these viruses with standard reagents and assays197. Recent advances in HA probes for flow cytometry, single-cell analysis, sequencing technology and bioinformatics have led to the identification of antibody lineages associated with HA-stem-targeted broad neutralization of influenza strains across subtypes, and in some cases across groups. This type of analysis and application to vaccine-induced immune responses creates the possibility of using molecular sequencing of immunoglobulin genes from sorted B cells as clinical trial end points28,103,198,199. Although the association of antibody sequences and clinical outcomes from infectious diseases has not been established, these biomarkers represent a potential path forward200.",

The original establishment of an HAI titre of 1:40 as a correlate of protection and a surrogate end point for vaccine protection was, in part, based on data from human challenge43. FDA-approved influenza challenge viruses are available, and studies have been completed to define safe challenge doses204 and to establish criteria for quantifying clinical illness206. As for HAI in the past, immune correlates using more modern reagents and assays can be assessed in experimentally infected humans207, and human challenge can also be used to test efficacy of vaccines and passively administered antibody. A major limitation of the human influenza challenge model is that the infection, by intent, is largely restricted to the upper airway. Prevention of lower airway disease is one major objective for vaccine development, so vaccine efficacy cannot be directly assessed for the clinical end point of primary interest. In addition, the numbers and diversity of influenza viruses available for human challenge study are limited so it will be difficult to show vaccine efficacy against multiple viruses. In general, higher doses of virus are used for challenge than are seen in natural infection. Nevertheless, if vaccines or passively administered monoclonal antibodies can prevent or diminish upper airway disease, or show an effect on viral load in the human challenge model, this may facilitate regulatory approval and may contribute to the identification of alternative immunological correlates of protection.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza vaccine production remains an enormous challenge for manufacturers as the vaccines must be produced and released 6 months after the WHO announces the vaccine strains for the following season in a given hemisphere. Currently, there are three different production technologies approved for influenza vaccines: egg-based, cell-based and recombinant proteins. The majority of the licensed vaccines are made using embryonic chicken eggs, and even though this production system has remained unchanged for decades, it is still the only method that can meet the current annual need of seasonal influenza vaccine for the global population. Five hundred million doses are generated annually but could potentially produce 1.5 billion seasonal and 6.4 billion pandemic doses214. Vaccines produced from cell culture were first approved by the FDA in 2012 (ref.215) and a synthetic HA vaccine was subsequently approved in 2013 (ref.216). This recombinant protein-based approach allows a process that does not require virus propagation and can be run on a large scale once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. Together with the recent advances in high-cell density, perfusion continuous flow processing217, this approach opens the door to producing next-generation subunit protein vaccines and meeting the increasing demand for safe, affordable and effective influenza vaccines.",

Eighteen influenza A HA subtypes have been detected in nature, and they can be further divided into group 1 and group 2 based on amino acid sequence composition, whereas influenza B HA subtypes have differentiated into two serologically distinct lineages (B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like). Current licensed flu vaccines consist of one H1 strain, one H3 strain and one or two influenza B viruses. H2 virus also has the ability to infect humans and caused the pandemic in 1957. Occasionally, transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses, such as H5, H7 and H9, to humans has been reported. *H17 and H18 are from bat influenza.

Conserved neutralizing antibody epitopes in the receptor binding site and stem are mapped onto the crystal structure of the HA ectodomain from A/South Carolina/1918 (H1N1) (PDB 1RUZ) and highlighted in yellow. Right: HA structural model showing a broadly neutralizing H1 subtype-specific (CH65) antibody bound to the receptor binding site and a pan-group 1 (CR6261) antibody targeting the stem (adapted from Nabel and Fauci5). CH65 is isolated from an adult donor and neutralizes various H1N1 viruses by preventing viral attachment to its sialic acid-containing receptor. CR6261 also comes from a human subject and neutralizes a broad range of viruses within group 1 HA. It recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the HA stem and blocks viral entry by preventing membrane fusion. b | Structural models of novel immunogens that target the conserved HA stem region: stabilized stem HA\u2013ferritin and trimeric mini-HA. Stabilized stem HA\u2013ferritin is generated by fusion of the stem region of HA to a self-assembling ferritin nanoparticle. This immunogen lacks the immunodominant head domain and elicits only stem-specific immune responses. The mini-HA is another \u2018headless\u2019 antigen that preserves the structural and antigenic integrity of the HA stem and has been shown to provide heterosubtypic immunity.
