When used, assessment must contribute to the learning experience\u2014i.e. be conducted for and of learning,\u2019 which is often not the case in practice where staff undertake annual competencies, increasingly in an online format, purely to meet an administrative requirement.5 It is for this reason perhaps that there are approximately 200,000 healthcare associated infections reported each year from Australian health facilities, which makes them the most common complication for patients.6 Even with these statistics well known, the situation remains that standard and transmission-based precautions are still not well complied with by healthcare workers.7\n",

However, this is a generalisation and the individual teacher will need to ascertain the level of acceptance within their intended audience.

Because of this, teachers cannot count on subtext within the film to be known and therefore need to choose images/clips that are unambiguous and clearly linked to the message conveyed in the class. Another issue to consider is that many of these films will be low budget and possibly low in quality, which may reflect on the presentation. Films such as and 28 offer high-quality production values and a range of scenes, and can therefore be used to advocate for more rigorous infection prevention and control practice.26 Examples that we have used previously include a scene from Shaun of the Dead to highlight the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in trauma settings and a scene from the Australian movie Undead that champions the role of the infection prevention and control professional.27\n",

This is particularly engaging if you get staff involved and adds to the reinforcement of the message.

The author\u2019s suggestion that a zombie epidemic is theoretically possible may seem far fetched, yet the fact remains that nurses in particular are responsible for implementing many initial and secondary interventions in any outbreak of disease.29 These would include isolation/quarantine and infection prevention, observations, medication administration and other interventions, all of which put the nurse/healthcare worker at some risk.",

Cassir et al. and Tomas et al. show the role of contaminated PPE in potentially spreading disease owing to poor doffing procedures.34 This is an area highly suited to using zombie scenarios in training. The outbreaks of SARS, MERs and Ebola showed that health services can be a centre of amplification of outbreaks. Knowing this can temper the enthusiasm of staff to attend work during outbreaks, particularly if training and planning have not specifically addressed these concerns.",
