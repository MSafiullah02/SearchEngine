            "text": "In the US, 40% of families have school-aged children and in more than 90% of these households, at least one parent is employed outside the home. Schools play an important role in these working families. 1 Yet schools have been closed for approximately 2 months in an effort to curb the COVID-19 pandemic and closing has had a profound influence on family health and wellbeing. When and how should they reopen? We approach these questions with limited data and past epidemics provide little guidance for COVID-19. 2 But, we know this: schools will reopen. Their closure is too burdensome on parents, communities, and the economy. Simply put, we cannot fully re-open society without re-opening schools. This requires that children will be part of the first wave to re-emerge from shelter-in-place policies. With fast-approaching preparations required for a new school year, a collaborative team of clinicians, scientists, and educators developed this commentary to begin to highlight issues that must be considered to ensure a safe and strategically planned re-opening of schools. The American Academy of Pediatrics also has recently posted considerations important to the re-opening of schools. 3 In the U.S., in an urgent attempt to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2 and save lives, the nationwide closure of K-12 schools occured rapidly. Planning for schools re-opening must be more deliberate, delineating precisely how, when, under what conditions, and base the reopening on available data. School re-opening can mitigate risks to children, families, and school personnel only if it is sensitive to community needs. Models such as the CDC's Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child 4 and the School Health Index 5 can provide a helpful framework.",

Schools are a bedrock of the American social network, providing not only education, but also nutritional support, healthcare and social services. The response to pandemicrelated challenges will require augmenting existing school-based programs. The pandemic has impacted students' access to and relationships with healthcare providers, with many children needing more behavioral and medical care services. As schools re-open, school-based health centers should be expanded. These centers improve student health and educational outcomes and reduce healthcare disparities among vulnerable student populations, while providing demonstrable cost savings. 10 In addition, federally assisted school-based meal programs annually benefit nearly 30 million children. 11 Student eligibility for these programs, meal distribution practices, and food safety standards must be reviewed and adjusted to meet the unprecedented circumstances. Consideration must be given to the availability of these programs to student caregivers and parents, more of whom are unemployed with each passing week. Finally, schools and communities must support teachers and staff returning to school. Concerns and stress among schoolstaff may exacerbate already high rates of teacher turnover that disproportionately affect students attending under-resourced schools. Greater school instability could undermine safe school re-opening.",
