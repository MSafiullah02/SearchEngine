            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a suspected zoonotic source in Wuhan, China. Driven by its ability to spread through respiratory droplets, including by asymptomatic individuals, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly traversed international borders to infect over 1.5 million people in over 200 countries. 1 Now termed as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is the first coronavirus to be declared a global pandemic and carries a mortality rate of 1% to 10%. 1,2 In order to curtail the spread of COVID-19, restrictive measures have been implemented worldwide. This has included the closure of international borders, country-wide lockdowns, limitations on gatherings, social distancing and the quarantining of any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. 3 The overarching intention of these measures is to \"flatten the curve,\" ie, reduce the peak incidence of active COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations so that healthcare systems are not overburdened. Unfortunately, healthcare workers (HCWs) remain up to 3 times more likely to contract COVID-19 than the general population, 4 with up to 20% having contracted the disease within certain geographical regions. 5 Accordingly, jurisdictions and gastroenterological societies around the world have recommended the suspension of non-urgent endoscopy. [6] [7] [8] [9] In this article, we discuss the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with endoscopy and the implications of a reduced endoscopy service. We propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care (POC) tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible. Our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and HCWs, but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment (PPE).",

            "text": "Endoscopy is currently limited to emergency or urgent procedures including the treatment of GI bleeding, foreign body removal, acute luminal obstruction, and cholangitis. Furthermore, the endoscopic diagnosis, staging, or resection of advanced lesions and malignancy may be performed on a case-by-case basis. However, as peak SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are reached in the presymptomatic phase of disease, there are concerns that upper GI procedures including gastroscopy, ERCP, and EUS may aerosolize virus particles that are shed from the nasopharynx of infected individuals. 10 This risk may be further enhanced if a patient dry retches, sneezes, coughs, or requires endotracheal intubation. Although data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosol-generating procedures are lacking, prior studies on SARS-CoV revealed that HCWs exposed to such procedures were 4.66 times (95% CI, 3.13-6.94) more likely to become infected than nonexposed HCWs. 11 With the detection of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in stool surpassing that of respiratory samples in up to 23% of patients, 12-19 the risk of fecal-oral transmission during colonoscopy is also plausible. This concern is not unfounded, with tissue samples from the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum of COVID-19 patients all demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 16 Additionally, as microbial dissemination can occur up to 6 feet away from a patient undergoing endoscopy 20 and bodily fluids may splatter when manipulating devices in and out of the working channel of an endoscope; there is also a risk of fomite and environmental transmission. This risk is extended to clerical and cleaning staff because SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to easily contaminate a patient's surroundings, including sinks, light switches, and doors, 21 and is viable on plastics and stainless steel for hours. 22 Thus, because endoscopy is viewed as a high-risk procedure for COVID-19 transmission, current guidelines recommend the use of PPE for all emergency and urgent procedures, including a fullsleeve gown, eye protection, hairnet, gloves, and respirator mask. 23 Although there was an initial concern over a potential shortage of PPE in the United States, with over 500,000 cases by mid-April 2020, this is looking less likely due to a smaller than projected case-load and increased PPE procurement, 1, 24, 25 Another byproduct of current mitigation measures is the delay of the projected peak by a further 6 months. 24,25 It should also be noted that the active case-load will take time to subside and the eventual relaxation of mitigation measures may also result in disease resurgence. 26 These additional challenges may result in a further delay to the re-institution of elective endoscopy.",

In the United States, 17.7 million endoscopic procedures are performed annually, accounting for 5.6% of the population. 27 Furthermore, over $136 billion USD is spent on gastrointestinal disease annually, exceeding that of heart disease, trauma and mental health. 27 Similar trends exist in less-populous countries such as Australia, where over 850,000 endoscopic procedures are performed annually, accounting for 3.5% of the population, 13.0% of all same-day separations from healthcare facilities and 7.2% (or $5 billion AUD) of all public and private hospital expenditure. 29, 29 In the United States alone, a hypothetical suspension of elective endoscopy for 6 months is predicted to result in the delayed diagnosis of over 2,800 colorectal cancers and 22,000 high-grade adenomatous polyps with malignant potential. 27 The 6 month mortality rate for those eventually diagnosed with colorectal cancer would increase by 6.5%. 30 Just as ominously, with over 600,000 cirrhotic patients in the United States, over 1,500 may have a terminal variceal bleed that may have been otherwise prevented by endoscopic surveillance . 31-34 Thus, it is clear that the longterm suspension of routine endoscopy is unsustainable, and therefore imperative that we resume elective endoscopy as early and safely as possible. A deeper understanding of available screening tools and the host-immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is valuable in working toward achieving this goal.",

However, because the quality of the screening tests used is unclear, there is a possibility that the negative PCR results may have been false negatives. This is reflected in other studies that reveal that despite a median seroconversion time of 7 days and rising antibody titres, viral shedding and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from sputum and stool could take up to 3 weeks, including in asymptomatic individuals. 15,38,39 Hence, given the limited body of knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 immunity, it would be prudent to currently assume that re-activation, re-infection, and viral shedding can occur despite seroconversion.",

Both iNAAT and CRISPR can also be performed on nasopharyngeal swabs and are highly specific (>95%) to SARS-CoV-2 (41-44). Unlike RT-PCR, iNAAT does not require multiple heating cycles and therefore can provide results within 15 minutes with a sensitivity of >95%. 45 A FDA-approved iNAAT POC test is readily available and has already been procured by clinics and hospitals across the United States. CRISPR relies on the Cas13a protein to form a complex with amplified RNA product, which then cleaves a fluorophore-quencher probe to produce a fluorescent light, signalling disease. Although it can yield a result in 60 minutes with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 100%, there is currently no POC test available. 43 stratified risk based on the proposed endoscopic procedure, although recommend use of respirator masks in all cases. We believe that a safe return to routine endoscopy is possible by using a strict protocol that stratifies risk by combining an assessment of epidemiological and clinical risk-factors with the use of highly sensitive rapid POC tests (Figure 1) .

This information can be assessed against the sensitivity of available POC tests to determine the number of false negative results expected per 10,000 asymptomatic individuals tested (Figure 2) .

Comparatively, in a higher-prevalence population of 2%, there would be 10 false negative results per 10,000 patients.

Although Repici et al 52 prudently stratified risk based on clinical and epidemiological factors, there is potential for asymptomatic individuals to be overlooked. More recently, Han et al 53 introduced a laboratory-based RT-PCR test to assess risk, however this was time-consuming and it is unclear if it assisted in rationalizing the use of PPE.
