Figure 1, A to C, shows simulations of reported cases\ngenerated using the best-fitting model parameter estimates. The distribution of these\nstochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well. In addition, the\nbest-fitting model captures the spread of infections with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to\nother cities in China (fig. S17). Our median estimate of the effective reproductive number,\nRe\u2014equivalent to the basic reproductive number\n(R0) at the beginning of the epidemic\u2014is 2.38 (95% CI:\n2.04\u22122.77), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of COVID-19 (Table 1 and Fig. 1D).\nThis finding aligns with other recent estimates of the reproductive number for this time\nperiod (6, 11\u201315). In addition, the median estimates for the latent and\ninfectious periods are approximately 3.69 and 3.48 days, respectively. We also find that,\nduring 10\u201323 January, only 14% (95% CI: 10\u201318%) of total infections in China\nwere reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections: 86%. This\nfinding is independently corroborated by the infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated\nfrom Wuhan (see supplementary materials). These undocumented infections are estimated to have\nbeen half as contagious per individual as reported infections (\u03bc = 0.55; 95% CI:\n0.46\u20130.62). Other model fittings made using alternate values of\nTd and Seedmax or different\ndistributional assumptions produced similar parameter estimates (figs. S18 to S22), as did\nestimations made using an alternate model structure with separate average infection periods\nfor undocumented and documented infections (see supplementary methods, table S1). Further\nsensitivity testing indicated that \u03b1 and \u03bc are uniquely identifiable given the\nmodel structure and abundance of observations utilized (see supplementary methods and Fig. 1, E and F). In particular, Fig. 1F shows that the highest log-likelihood fittings are centered in the\n95% CI estimates for \u03b1 and \u03bc and drop off with distance from the best fitting\nsolution (\u03b1= 0.14 and \u03bc = 0.55).",

These control measures included travel restrictions imposed between\nmajor cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government;\nand more available rapid testing for infection confirmation (11, 12).\nThese measures along with changes in medical care-seeking behavior due to increased awareness\nof the virus and increased personal protective behavior (e.g., wearing of facemasks, social\ndistancing, self-isolation when sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of\nthe outbreak after 23 January. To quantify these differences, we re-estimated the system\nparameters using the model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported between 24\nJanuary and 8 February. As inter-city mobility was restricted after 23 January, we tested two\naltered travel scenarios: (i) scenario 1: a 98% reduction of travel in and out of Wuhan and an\n80% reduction of travel between all other cities, as indicated by changes in the Baidu\nMobility Index (16) (table S2); and\n(ii) scenario 2: a complete stoppage of inter-city travel (i.e., \u03b8 to 0) (see\nsupplementary methods for more details).",

For both periods, the best-fitting\nmodel for Scenario 1 had a reduced reporting delay, Td, of 6 days\n(vs. 10 days before 23 January), consistent with more rapid confirmation of infections.\nEstimates of both the latency and infectious periods were similar to those made for\n10\u201323 January; however, \u03b1, \u03b2, and Re all\nshifted considerably. The transmission rate of documented cases, \u03b2, dropped to 0.52\n(95% CI: 0.39\u20130.71) during Period 1 and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27\u20130.50) during Period\n2, less than half the estimate prior to travel restrictions (Table 2). The fraction of all infections that were documented, \u03b1, was\nestimated to be 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60\u20130.69), i.e., 65% of infections were documented\nduring Period 1, up from 14% prior to travel restrictions, and remained nearly the same for\nPeriod 2.

While\nthe estimate for the relative transmission rate, \u03bc, is lower than before 23 January,\nthe contagiousness of undocumented infections, represented by \u03bc\u03b2, was\nsubstantially reduced, possibly reflecting that only very mild, less contagious infections\nremain undocumented or that individual protective behavior and contact precautions have proven\neffective. Similar parameter estimates are derived under Scenario 2 (no travel at all) (table\nS3). These inference results for both Period 1 and 2 should be interpreted with caution as\ncare-seeking behavior and control measures were continually in flux at these times.",

This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of whom were likely not\nseverely symptomatic, appears to have facilitated the rapid spread of the virus throughout\nChina. Indeed, suppression of the infectiousness of these undocumented cases in model\nsimulations reduces the total number of documented cases and the overall spread of SARS-CoV2\n(Fig. 2). In addition, the best-fitting model has a\nreporting delay of 9 days from initial infectiousness to confirmation; in contrast line-list\ndata for the same 10\u201323 January period indicates an average 6.6 day delay from initial\nmanifestation of symptoms to confirmation (17).
