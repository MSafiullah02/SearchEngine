            "text": "Protease inhibitors have drawn the attention of many investigators due to their potential value. For instance, HIV protease inhibitors and SARS coronavirus proteinase inhibitors may be used to combat HIV and SARS virus, respectively. Plant protease inhibitors may have anti-insect and antifungal activities. They may be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death in plants. They can cause inhalant allergies and also food allergies [1]. One of the common types of protease inhibitors is trypsin inhibitors which have been isolated from animal tissues and also from plant tissues [1], [2]. There are several types of plant trypsin inhibitors. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors have a molecular mass of about 20 kDa, a low cysteine content and a single reactive site while Bowman\u2013Birk trypsin inhibitors are approximately 8 kDa in size and possess a high cysteine content and two reactive sites [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The conformation in Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors is mainly \u03b2-sheet with a small amount of regular sheet. The insecticidal activity of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors has been demonstrated using transgenic plants [2]. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors have been ***isolated from the seeds of Erythrina species [9], Psophocarpus tetragonolebus\n[10], Prosopis juliflora\n[11], Acacia confusa\n[12], Enterolobium contortisiliquum\n[13], Bauhinia variegata\n[14], Delonix regia\n[15], Crotalaria paulina\n[16], Mucuna pruriens\n[17], Dimorphandra mollis\n[18], Copaifera langsdorfii\n[19], Phaseolus vulgaris\n[20], Pithecelobium dumosum\n[21], Veronica hederifolia\n[22] and Mirabilis jalapa\n[23]. Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors also inhibit other enzymes such as chymotrypsin, \u03b1-amylase and human plasmin, and block the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin [1]. The formation, degradation and gene expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor in the soybean have been reported [1]. Some seeds, e.g., those of Glycine max produce both Bowman\u2013Birk and Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors [24]. The seeds of bitter gourds, sponge gourds, wax gourds and Momordica cochinchinensis produce squash-type trypsin inhibitors with a molecular mass of about 3 kDa [25].",

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with strepatavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the trypsin inhibitor was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the protein [28]. The leguminous defensin-like protein sesquin was used as a positive control [28] and the antifungal protein mungin [32] as a negative control.",

The N-terminal sequence of the purified trypsin inhibitor was highly homologous to those of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors from yellow soybean, wild soybean and spinach (Table 2\n). Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor more potently inhibited trypsin than they inhibited chymotrypsin (Fig. 3\n). Dithiothreitol dose-dependently and time-dependently inhibited the trypsin-inhibitory activity of dull black soybean and soybean trypsin inhibitors (Fig. 4\n). The trypsin-inhibitory activity of BSKTI was totally preserved after exposure to the entire pH range (1\u201314) for 2 h, and after exposure to temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C for 10 min. Only 80 and 70% activity remained after exposure for 10 min to 90 and 100 \u00b0C, respectively (data not shown). The dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor enhanced nitric oxide production by murine macrophages, and so did lipopolysaccharide and Con A (Fig. 5A). The enhancement was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The enhancement caused by soybean trypsin inhibitor was only minimal. The dull black soybean inhibitor inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells and MCF7 cells with an IC50 of 39 and 70 \u03bcM, respectively. The corresponding values for soybean trypsin inhibitor were lower, being 31 and 47 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 6A and B). Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 9.4 \u03bcM (Fig. 7\n). Soybean trypsin inhibitor was inactive. Dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited translation in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system with an IC50 of 14 \u03bcM. Soybean trypsin inhibitor did not have translation-inhibitory activity (Fig. 8\n). There was no effect of the two trypsin inhibitors on mitogenic response of splenocytes and the activities of HIV-1 integrase and SARS proteinase (data not shown). Antifungal and antibacterial activities were also absent (data not shown).",

            "text": "The Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor isolated in the present investigation from Chinese dull black soybeans (BSKTI) is similar to its counterpart from yellow soybean (G. max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja) in N-terminal sequence. Similarity to other leguminous trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitors, however, is less obvious. The difference in molecular mass of the peak derived from BSKTI in gel filtration (40 kDa) and that of the band in SDS-PAGE (20 kDa) suggests that it is a dimeric Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor like the inhibitor from Leucaena leucocephala\n[35]. Like G. soja trypsin inhibitor, which is adsorbed on SP-Toyopearl and DEAE-Toyopearl [24], BSKTI is adsorbed on SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose and Mono Q. BSKTI is highly purified after three ion-exchange chromatographic steps as evidenced by presence of a single peak in gel filtration on Superdex 75 and a single band in SDS-PAGE. Previously a procedure involving (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose and anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose followed by chromatography on a trypsin affinity column was used to isolate the protease inhibitor bikunin from human urine [36]. The yield of BSKTI is comparable to that from Peltophorum dubium (50 mg/100 g) [37] but much higher than that (1.1 mg/100 g) from broad beans [3]. BSKTI is obtained with a purification fold about 9 times higher than that for the trypsin inhibitor from madeira-vine [38]. Like the sporamin B-like trypsin inhibitor from wampee seeds [39], BSKTI exerts an inhibitory action on cell-free translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system. It is known that some proteins with anti-proliferative activity inhibit translation in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system [40].",

The inhibitory effect of dithiothreitol on trypsin-inhibitory activity of BSKTI is indicative of the significance of the disulfide bonds to the activity of the inhibitor.

The observation that BSKTI has pronounced pH stability and thermostability and serine protease-inhibitory activity adds to the importance of the TI. Leguminous plants produce a variety of proteins including antifungal proteins [28], lectins [29], ribosome inactivating proteins [34], trypsin inhibitors [2], and \u03b1-amylase inhibitors.

            "text": "In summary, the isolated trypsin inhibitor is fairly stable and has some exploitable activities. It has the potential of being developed into an agent for anticancer therapy in view of its potent anti-proliferative activity forward tumor cells and ability to elicit nitric oxide production from macrophages. On the other hand, it may not be useful in helping plants in combating against pathogenic fungi and bacteria since it lacks antifungal and antibacterial activities. It has potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and hence is a potential antiretroviral agent. However, there is no inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, unlike plant antifungal proteins [43]. The present investigation also reveals that dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor resembles soybean trypsin inhibitor in ability to inhibit activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin and tumor cell proliferation, but differs in ability to stimulate macrophages nitric oxide production and inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and cell-free translation. It appears that dull black soybean trypsin inhibitor is more versatile than soybean trypsin inhibitor in its biological activity.",
