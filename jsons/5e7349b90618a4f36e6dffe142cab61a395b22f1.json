I determine the clinical and economic value both of 'squashing' and 'flattening' the curve, thus assuming, respectively, that new vaccines or treatments will and will not be available before herd immunity through national infection is achieved. As the study does not analyze specific subgroups of the population but the population in aggregate, minimizing the number of life years lost by 'flattening the curve' effectively translates into minimizing lives lost by minimizing the CFR (when 'squashing the curve', it is possible to minimize life years or lives lost by reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections). Moreover, when 'flattening the curve' the economic value of minimizing the number of life years lost corresponds to the maximum economic value of a shutdown that is 100% effective at preventing an overstretch of ICU capacity (because a successful shutdown leads to a minimization of lives lost and life years lost). Hence, under a scenario in which the spread of the virus in the population is unavoidable, a successful shutdown presents the best-case scenario.",

In order to account for an increase in mortality due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, I used two methodological approaches. In the first, I multiplied the probabilities of survival given exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with the probabilities of survival from competing causes of death. This calculation relies on an independence assumption, implying that individuals not dying from COVID 19 have the same probability of death as all individuals before the rise of the pandemic. Given that patients who die from COVID 19 tend to have more comorbidities (Wu 2020), I assumed a harvesting effect in the second approach. This approach presumes that those who die from COVID-19 are sicker and \"would have died anyway\" (cf. Financial Times 2020). In this scenario, I assumed for age groups with excess mortality associated with COVID-19 (the difference between observed and noncrisis mortality rates) that except for COVID-19, there are no other causes of death in the forthcoming 12 months. This is compatible with the notion that COVID-19 may be \"the cause of all fatalities\" (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2020). This implies that those who do not die from COVID-19 despite being infected represent a healthier population. In either approach, the population that is not infected (which is one minus the proportion of the population that has recovered from COVID-19 to provide herd immunity) is assumed to remain at risk for competing causes of death.",

In Germany, the prices of new, innovative drugs are subject to negotiation between manufacturers and representatives of statutory health insurance (SHI). Negotiated list prices hold for all German citizens, including those covered by private insurance. From the perspective of an average citizen, notable similarities between COVID-19 and cancer exist. First, with regard to the next 12 months (the earliest point in time a vaccine is expected to become available), the expected death toll from cancer will fall in a similar range (approximately 223,000 people in Germany died of cancer in 2016 (Robert Koch Institut 2016)). Hence, from the perspective of an average citizen, deaths from cancer will not be more remote than deaths from COVID-19. A similar conclusion would be drawn when analyzing excess mortality, which is absent in most age groups. Therefore, at the population level, both diseases seem to pose a similar threat to life within the next 12 months.",

In addition, for both diseases, the vast majority of people is not expected to suffer. 2 Notably, the contingent-valuation method, which asks members of a representative sample of the population for their hypothetical willingness to pay, requires educating participants about epidemiological concepts, such as excess mortality and competing diseases, which are key for understanding the mortality burden in COVID-19. That is, a survey cannot simply focus on COVID-19 and ignore concomitant diseases. However, even if this were feasible, contingent-valuation techniques, such as discrete choice experiments, have not found their way into the official drug assessment and pricing policy of pharmaceuticals in Germany, despite being tested over many years and even in a perhaps less controversial role, i.e., weighting the adverse events and desirable outcomes of drugs. Therefore, it seems unlikely that a population survey using a discrete choice experiment or an alternative contingent-valuation technique could influence policymaking in this crisis. Furthermore, politicians who are involved in current policymaking accept the negotiation outcomes for pharmaceuticals (otherwise, the negotiation process would be on the political agenda). Hence, politicians may also have a more favorable view of using the negotiation results for the purpose of putting a price tag on the life years gained from the shutdown. 1 The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations is less reliable because it includes quarantine as an indication. 2 This framework resembles that of Dworkin's Theory of Equality (1981), in which an \"average member of the community\" (ibid., p. 297) behind a 'thin' veil of ignorance does not know which handicaps he will eventually develop but does know the probability of becoming handicapped. Using this framework does not necessitate, however, to incorporate all constituents of Dworkin's Theory of Equality and to accept the resource allocation principles inferred from it.",

Given that the economic value would need to be compared against the direct (non-)medical costs to treat COVID-19 patients as well as the indirect costs secondary to productivity loss, the perspective of the analysis is inherently societal. Given the societal perspective, I made the simplifying assumption that cancer drug costs from the SHI perspective are equal to the drug costs from a societal perspective. Strictly speaking, this does not hold particularly if manufacturers reside inside Germany.

As the lower bound, I used data from an analysis of the European Surveillance System (TESSy) database including 13,368 patients admitted to the ICU with laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection between 2009 and 2017 (Adlhoch 2019). In this sample, 83% of patients were ventilated, which is higher than the current rate in Germany (69%). The CFR was 21%, based on a median age of 59 years of admitted patients. Hence, the median age was lower than the median age of death (82 years) currently reported for Germany (Robert Koch Institut 2020).

This implication, however, is contradictory to the present situation, as the pressure to save on health care costs will increase as a con- Given the unprecedented economic value as a share of GDP estimated in this study, the corona crisis also leads to new challenges for economic evaluations in health care and public health. Perhaps the most similar dilemma has arisen surrounding one-off treatments (cures) for genetic disorders.

The latter may present an underestimate due to a time window between the beginning of an infection and death. On the other hand, it may present an overestimate due to undiagnosed cases in the population and deaths of COVID-19 patients attributable to concomitant diseases. The median age of death was 82 years on May 8, 2020 (Robert Koch Institut 2020). The German federal government and the federal states have responded with travel restrictions and the closures of schools, universities, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other public and private entities. In Germany, a major purpose of the shutdown of businesses and social activities is to postpone the pandemic wave ('flattening the curve') to avoid overstretching intensive care capacity at the time of peak demand. Hence, intensive care capacity presents a critical bottleneck in responding to the pandemic.",

The average annual costs of comparators are \u20ac26,102 (Hammerschmidt, 2017), resulting in incremental costs of \u20ac39,751. Information on the average incremental survival benefit was taken from an analysis of all anticancer drugs launched in Germany between 2011 and 2016 and granted an additional benefit by the German Federal Joint Committee until June 2016. The analysis shows a median incremental survival benefit of 4.7 months or 0.39 years (Storm 2017). This result is similar to what was found in an analysis of 58 anticancer drugs approved in the U.S. between 1995 and 2013, showing an average incremental survival benefit of 0.46 years (Howard 2015). However, in both analyses, the incremental survival benefits are underestimated because they are restricted to the trial period; i.e., not extrapolated beyond the trial period (strictly speaking, this is the case only for 47 out of 58 drugs in the study by Howard et al.; see also the Discussion). Dividing incremental costs by the incremental survival benefit yields \u20ac101,493 per life year gained (\u20ac39,751/0.39 life years).",

Based on the harvesting assumption, the average number of life years per avoided death is 5.6 years because the population that dies is assumed to be sicker. On a statistical note, the number of life years per avoided death is equivalent to the change in life years gained by a 1% change in the CFR. For a newborn, the loss in life expectancy amounts to 0.17 and 0.21 for men and women, respectively.

Although the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is presumed to be a one-time event, the loss of life years with insufficient ICU capacity is tremendous, yielding a commensurate health gain by a shutdown that is successful in 'flattening the curve'. Nevertheless, when herd immunity through natural infection is unavoidable, the loss of life years expressed in terms of the life expectancy of a newborn falls in the range of the annual gain in life expectancy in Germany over the past decade (Federal Office of Statistics 2019). In other words, at the time of herd immunity, the current pandemic will have canceled out the gain in life expectancy obtained from health care and public health interventions in the 12 months preceding the pandemic.",

Furthermore, reducing the number of deaths prevents grief among caregivers. Moreover, COVID-19 containment measures including the shutdown may provide a feeling of security and trust in the government. Finally, 'squashing the curve' might prevent direct (non-)medical costs and indirect costs associated with nonfatal COVID-19 cases. Some of the biases listed in this and the previous paragraph may cancel each other out. Additional limitations apply to the estimate of the economic value of a life year borrowed from new, innovative cancer drugs. On the one hand, the estimate is too low because the costs of drug-related adverse events and drug-related services are ignored and the costs of cancer treatment are limited to a period of one year.

            "text": ". Nevertheless, the magnitude of payments required for the COVID-19 shutdown is unparalleled. Hence, while the debate around one-off treatments appears structurally similar, it anticipates only a little of what we are facing. Even with an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio of the shutdown, one-time expenditures (corresponding to the economic value of a successful shutdown) would lead to a considerable drop in GDP. In fact, without government intervention, this dip could have major ramifications for financing health care. Considering the maximum economic value of 'flattening the curve', a 14% drop in GDP would result in a 16% increase in the portion of total income spent on health care to fund the same type of health care basket (this increase explicitly does not refer to the increase in the contribution rate for SHI, which may be lower than 16%). As the basket does not cover COVID-19, the rise in spending must be viewed independently of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and not as an indirect way of supporting the shutdown. If the rise were not acceptable, underfunding of the health care system would result in order to keep spending within an acceptable range. Obviously, this problem is dramatically increased in the case of 'squashing the curve'. Hence, there seems to be a tipping point where a drop in income necessitates saving on health expenditures. Defining this tipping point may be starting point for a discussion about the level of GDP decrease that may result in underfunding of the health care system. Of note, mobilizing additional resources for the health care sector through tax financing, national debt, or other means merely shifts the problem of underfunding to employers, other public sectors, or future generations. As a consequence of underfunding, there would be a commensurate loss of lives due to other diseases, thus leading to a zero-sum game. Such opportunity costs are already conceivable at the hospital level, where excess admission for COVID-19 cases strains the health care system and possibly increases mortality from other serious diseases where hospital care is clearly effective (Ioannidis 2020).",
