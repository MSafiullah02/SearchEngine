            "text": "We investigate the transition probabilities for the \"flavor\" eigenstates in the twolevel quantum system, which is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry. Particularly, we concentrate on the so-called PT-broken phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian turn out to be a complex conjugate pair. In this case, we find that the transition probabilities will be unbounded in the limit of infinite time t \u2192 +\u221e. After making a connection between the PT-broken phase and the neutral-meson system in particle physics, we observe that the infinite-time behavior of the transition probabilities can be attributed to the negative decay width of one eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We also present some brief remarks on the situation at the so-called exceptional point, where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the joint parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry have recently attracted a lot of attention [1] and very interesting applications have been found for a number of physical systems in particle physics, nuclear physics, optics, electronics, and many others [2] . In the existing literature, the two-level system with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [3, 4] has been extensively investigated, as a simple but instructive example, to explore and clarify all related conceptual issues [5] [6] [7] . However, it is worthwhile to mention that the transition amplitudes and probabilities between the \"flavor\" eigenstates have rarely been studied, except for some general discussion in Refs. [8, 9] .",

            "text": ", it is intriguing to consider the transitions among \"flavor\" eigenstates in the system with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [12, 13] . In our previous work [13], we calculated the transition probabilities for the \"flavor\" eigenstates in the scenario, where the PT symmetry is always preserved and two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are real, which is known as the PT-symmetric phase. In the present work, we aim to extend the previous study in the PT-symmetric phase to the PT-broken phase. The primary motivation for such an extension is at least two-fold. First, by \"flavor\" eigenstates of a two-level quantum system with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H, we mean the complete set of basis vectors {|u \u03b2 } (for \u03b2 = a, b), in which the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian is given by H \u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 u \u03b1 |H|u \u03b2 and the left vectors u \u03b1 | \u2261 |u \u03b1 \u2020 and u \u03b2 | \u2261 |u \u03b2 \u2020 (for \u03b1, \u03b2 = a, b) have been defined as in conventional quantum mechanics. Therefore, the transition amplitudes in the following discussion will be referred to the projection of the time-evolved flavor eigenstates {|u \u03b1 (t) } into their initial states {|u \u03b2 }. However, whenever the transition amplitudes A \u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 u \u03b2 |u \u03b1 (t) are calculated, we will clearly indicate the exact definition of the involved inner product as well as that of the left state vectors. As mentioned, for PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the transition amplitudes A \u03b1\u03b2 and the corresponding probabilities P \u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 |A \u03b1\u03b2 | 2 have been explicitly computed and extensively studied in Ref. [13] . Hence, it is a natural continuation to extend the investigation to the PT-broken phase. Second, in contrast to the PT-symmetric phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are real, the PT-broken phase will be complicated by a complexconjugate pair of eigenvalues. As is well known, if PT symmetry is maintained, it is always possible to find a similarity transformation that converts a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into its Hermitian counterpart [5, 7, 13] . However, this is impossible for the PT-broken phase, rendering it rather different. Hence, in this particular case, the transition probabilities deserve a dedicated study.",

With the above comparative study, we can observe that the transition probabilities P aa and P ab calculated using the ordinary inner product become infinite in the limit of t \u2192 +\u221e as well, as in the case of the PT -inner product. In analogy to the neutral-meson system, this observation can be attributed to the fact that the total decay width \u0393 1 = \u22122\u03b3 < 0 of one energy eigenstate is negative.

Second, using the PT -inner product, we have calculated the transition amplitudes and probabilities for the flavor eigenstates, i.e., |u \u03b1 \u2192 |u \u03b2 for \u03b1, \u03b2 = a, b. After introducing the CPT flavor eigenstates CPT |\u0169 a = +|\u0169 a and CPT |\u0169 b = \u2212|\u0169 b as the final states, we have found that the differenceP aa \u2212P ab between, instead of the sumP aa +P ab of, the corresponding transition probabilities, vanishes and is time-independent. However, the probabilities themselves in the PT-broken phase have been found to be infinite in the limit of t \u2192 +\u221e, which is totally different from the corresponding result in the PT-symmetric phase. Third, in analogy to the neutral-meson system, we have also calculated the transition probabilities using the ordinary inner product, which is equivalent to the T -inner product, and observed that the infinitetime behavior of the probabilities originates from the negative decay width \u0393 1 = \u22122\u03b3 < 0 of one energy eigenstate. For this reason, one might have to find practical applications of the PT-broken phase in dynamical systems beyond particle physics.",

In a similar way, the practical applications of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the PT-broken phase may be accomplished only after coupling it to another system. This is the case for the neutral-meson system, where the weak interaction is switched on in order for the neutral mesons to decay. As we have mentioned, realistic applications may be lying beyond particle physics due to the negative decay width. We leave all these important points for future works.",
