The primary control measure is social distancing, but maintaining such 30 controls will be challenging. 31 32 Traditional control measures from an infectious disease include personal hygiene, vaccination, vector 33 control, environmental controls, prophylaxis and quarantine. For example, vaccinia virus eradicated 34 smallpox, bed nets control malaria and condoms reduce HIV transmission. As SARS-CoV-2 transmits to the face or mouth, an alternative would be to protect these areas, which can be achieved by a 36 personal respirator. Widespread use of personal respirators has not been possible to date due to their 37 complexity and limited supply. We have developed a simple personal respirator in Southampton 38 (PeRSo), made from cheap, mass-produced components (7, 8 to productivity, with industries and business re-enabled, and individuals able to meet face-to-face. 51 52 Evidently, implementation challenges exist, but the alternative of waiting for a vaccine indefinitely 53 seem worse in terms of economic impact. As a control strategy, PeRSo use outside the house would 54 be compulsory in areas with active transmission. Once the cycle of transmission is broken, respirator 55 use would be optional. Strengthened public health screening would be required to identify breakdown 56 areas, leading to travel restrictions and return to compulsory PeRSo use. Humans would all look 57 highly unusual, but SARS-CoV-2 would be controlled and this would act as a bridge to a new vaccine 58 or drug therapy. Whilst the costs may seem high, compared to the economic costs of a prolonged 59 lock-down, this is trivial. 60",
