Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200 nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.",

The question about viruses refractive index in UV is still open [26] , but after studying of the four viruses investigators found, that median relative refractive index (because of virus samples are in water) in visible range is m 0 = 1.06 [13] . Because of it is hard to find information about the refractive index and its spectral change for viruses, calculations were carried out in wavelength range from 10 to 250 nm for constant refractive index m 0 = 1.06. So, this paper is devoted to studying the effects of shape only. Making calculations of scattered light intensity and degree of linear polarization for coronavirus model particles, one can estimate the influence of the spike proteins number on the scattering properties of particles.",

Fig. 6 demonstrates this, showing spectral dependence of intensity at different scattering angles. It can be seen from the figure that the drop is quite strong -the intensity of the scattered light decreases by more than an order of magnitude in a sufficiently small interval of wavelengths.

Fig. 8 shows maps of the degree of linear polarization of coronavirus model particles for different values of spike proteins. The X axis corresponds to the scattering angle values, and the Y axis -to the wavelengths. The degree of linear polarization is shown by different shades of gray: darker shades correspond to smaller polarization. An interesting polarization feature is observed in the spectral region of about 200 nm. If we consider it in more detail (see Fig. 9 ), it becomes clear that it consists in a very sharp jump in the degree of linear polarization with increasing wavelength. This feature is clearly manifested in spherical particles and is called the Quasi-Rayleigh polarization leap (QRPL) [29] . QRPL can occur even at refractive indices close to 1, and depends on the scattering angle, on the size, on the refractive index, and on the shape of the scattering particle [30] . This phenomenon can be characterized by wavelength \u03bb QRPL at which the rate of polarization change (i.e., the value of the derivative dP d\u03bb ) is maximal. In this case, we see that the spike proteins number also affects the position of the QRPL. As can be seen from Fig. 10 , the QRPL exhibits a behavior similar in intensity to a change in the spike proteins number. The smaller N, and the less dangerous the virus, the shorter the wavelengths corresponds to QRPL. It should be noted that \u03bb min and \u03bb QRPL differ in their values; therefore, they can be used by researchers as two independent sources of information about the spike proteins number.",

Upper part shows the intensity, lowerdegree of polarization. As can be seen, smooth spheres provide quantitatively different data, than model particles. This difference is most noticeable in the case of linear polarization degree, where the differences may reach about 10% on absolute value. This feature can be used for distinguishing viruses from non-viruses based on their light scattering in the cases when the size of the objects is not accurately determined. Fig. 12 b shows the same as Fig. 12 a, but for spectral region \u03bb = 75\u2026110 nm. The figure clearly shows that subsequent resonances in light scattering make the difference with smooth spheres more noticeable. It's because spikes begin to exhibit non-Rayleigh scattering at wavelength decreasing, which means more and more depolarize light. In principle, depolarization of light scattered by model particles is associated with light scattering between the spikes, i.e. with multiple scattering, which always depolarizes light. Moreover, this multiple scattering will be more pronounced for spikes comparable to the wavelength than for those that are much smaller than the wavelength. Those, the shorter the wavelength at which observations are carried out, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses.",
