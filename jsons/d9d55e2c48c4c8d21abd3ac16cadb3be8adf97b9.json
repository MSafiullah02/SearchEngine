As Table 3 shows, the interaction (Model 1) between 5 perceived stress and self-esteem significantly predicted anxiety, suggesting that self-esteem 6 moderated the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. Simple slope tests suggested that, for 7 individuals with high (Mean + SD; B simple = 0.59, t = 13.06, p < .001) and low (Mean -SD; 8 B simple = 0.73, t = 16.80, p < .001) self-esteem, higher perceived stress predicted higher 9 anxiety ( Figure 4a ). Nevertheless, the slope for individuals with low self-esteem was larger 10 than that for individuals with high self-esteem. Further, self-esteem significantly moderated 1 the effect of perceived stress on sleep through anxiety. There was a significant indirect effect 2 at each level of self-esteem (Table 4) ; however, the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep 3 quality through anxiety was stronger at low levels of self-esteem. 4 Table 3 also shows the interaction (Model 2) between perceived stress and self-esteem, 5 which significantly predicted sleep quality. This suggests that self-esteem moderated the 6 direct effect of perceived stress on sleep quality. Simple slope tests ( Figure 4b) showed that, 7 for individuals with low self-esteem, higher perceived stress predicted lower sleep quality 8 (B simple = 0.76, t = 4.53, p < .001); however, for individuals with high self-esteem, perceived 9 stress was not related to sleep quality (B simple = 0.03, t = 1.56, p = .12). 10 Note.

PSQI = Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSS = Perceived Stress Scale; SAS 1 = Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; RSE = Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; *** P < .001; ** P < .01. 2 anxiety was stronger at low levels of self-esteem than at high levels of self-esteem. The direct 13 effect of perceived stress on sleep quality was moderated by self-esteem. 14 The number of poor sleepers in the current study was much higher than the proportion 15 reported in previous Chinese studies, which were not related to better than that of the front-line medical staff (mean PSQI = 8.58; [2]). We cautiously 10 speculate that the countermeasures for COVID-19 may reduce the impact of the pandemic on 11 the sleep quality of the general public. On one hand, to cut-off the transmission of the virus, 12 the general public was encouraged to practice home-isolation and wear masks, which 13 effectively reduced the risk of infection. On the other hand, during the period of 14 home-isolation, the state has implemented many measures to ensure that the daily lives of the 15 general public are as normal as possible; for example, college students can take classes online 16 at home. 17",

Specifically, the effect of perceived stress on anxiety was stronger in those 15 with low self-esteem vs. high self-esteem. These findings are consistent with TMT theory, 16 which suggests that high self-esteem helps buffer against anxiety [35, 36] . Accordingly, faced 17 with the stressors induced by COVID-19, participants with low self-esteem were more likely 18 to experience anxiety than were participants with high self-esteem. Individuals with high 19 self-esteem typically hold more positive beliefs (eg, intelligent, popular, attractive, etc.) about 20 themselves relative to those with low self-esteem [73] [74] [75] .

            "text": "Several limitations deserve mentioning. Previous studies showed that, compared with 10 women, men have shorter sleep quantity and lower sleep quality[78,79]. Results also suggest 11 that sleep problems are more common among women, especially those with depression 12[78,79]. However, owing to data collection problems, 795 participants did not report their sex, 13 which prevents analyzing any possible sex differences. To control for the potential influence 14 of sex on the current results, we only analyzed the data with sex information (n = 835, 254 15 men and 581 women). The results indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety (ab = 0.137, 16Boot SE = 0.02, Boot 95% CI = [0.11, 0.17]) and the moderated mediation analysis of 17 self-esteem (the effect of the interaction between perceived stress and self-esteem on anxiety: 18 B = -0.02, t = -2.00, p < 0.05) were both stable. Second, we did not have data from front-line 19 workers, which prevents directly analyzing the difference in sleep quality between front-line 20 workers and the non-diseased general public. Third, the measure of sleep was based on 21 individuals' subjective sleep reports. Previous studies showed that subjective sleep reports 1 could underestimate or overestimate sleep quality compared to objective sleep assessments 2 owing to psychological factors, such as mood[80][81][82]. Thus, future studies should try to 3 objectively measure sleep (eg, polysomnography or actigraphy). Finally, this study employed 4 a cross-sectional design; thus, we cannot infer causality. Further research should adopt 5 experimental or longitudinal designs to explore the causal implications of this study. , this study suggests that, owing to the increase in perceived stress during the 2019 8 COVID-19 pandemic, the sleep quality in the non-diseased general public deteriorated. 9Moreover, high levels of anxiety may be an explanation for the higher levels of stress 10 associated with worse sleep quality. Further, high self-esteem helped reduce people's anxiety 11 induced by perceived stress and lead to better sleep quality. These findings suggest that both 12 the sleep quality and the perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required 13 attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also identified personality characteristics 14 related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in 15 environmental adaptation. 16Acknowledgments 17We are grateful to Xuehan Zhang, Mei Zeng, Mengning Zhang, Haopeng Chen, Weiyu Hu, 18Yadong Liu, and Jiwen Li for data collection.19 Funding Details 20 This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Eliasson, A.

[53], surveyed the sleep quality of 27,912 Chinese rural individuals aged 18-79 17 years and found that 21.80% of participants were getting poor sleep [53]. Ning et al. [54], 18 found that 24.10% of 1,469 HIV-infected Chinese adults (aged 18-80 years) and 19.90% of 19 2,938 HIV-uninfected participants had poor sleep quality [54]. Jiang et al. [55], calculated the 20 global PSQI score only based on six subscale scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, 21 habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime 1 dysfunction), and found that 27.44% of 28,202 Chinese rural participants aged 18-79 years 2 were poor sleepers [55]. The current results thus suggest that the sleep quality of the 3non-diseased general public during COVID-19 was worse than usual. This study was 4 conducted when the pandemic was severe, which may explain the decline in participants' 5 sleep quality. In line with this notion, previous studies showed that exposure to stressors (eg, 6 hurricanes) leads to lower sleep quality, longer sleep latency, increased awareness during the 7 night, and more sleep complaints [3-5].However, our results suggested that, during 8 COVID-19, the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public (mean PSQI = 4.88) was 9",
