However, this alert, likely a summary of known ongoing activity, would then overload the map view with less important information and provide little benefit to the user. Another condition where optimum classification is difficult is in the case of multiple country involvement in a single outbreak. For instance, Switzerland may send disease specialists to help combat a dengue fever outbreak in Paraguay. In this case the primary locations of the alert are Switzerland and Paraguay, but if the system presents alert classifications in such a way as to imply that an outbreak of dengue fever is occurring in Switzerland, the user will be justifiably confused.

Further, if we change the input processing, for example, to retain more of the input data, such as capitalization and punctuation, we must update the entire pattern dictionary. A further disadvantage of the dictionary approach is that the system can only identify locations and diseases already known and stocked in the database. Moreover, a key step in enhancing the parser resolution consists of augmenting the database by capturing correct locations and disease names, often involving careful manual data entry. As national borders shift and names of places change, albeit infrequently, the system must be manually updated to reflect new geography. For example, we have already been affected by this issue, as we needed to update the parsing system to reflect the designation of Serbia and Montenegro as separate nations on June 5, 2006.",

Further, the language expert need have only very minimal technical knowledge with respect to natural language syntax or software development to contribute to the dictionary.

In order to correctly process this type of input, after it has identified a list of locations, the classification engine executes a secondary step, eliminating apparently redundant locations based on container relationships.

Comprehensive evaluation of these types of systems and data sources is also an important area and part of our ongoing and future research and collaboration with other disease tracking systems such as GPHIN, EpiSPIDER, MedISys, and Argus, would enable an in-depth comparison. With that said, there are a few broad comparisons we can draw between systems. One key area is accessibility: HealthMap is freely available to the public, whereas some systems are currently closed systems, requiring either paid subscription or approved access. Another key area is in the use of automation. While we certainly perform manual curation in maintaining HealthMap, our goal is to maximize automation in order to leverage the human contribution. The value of a full-time staff of language and domain experts to read and analyze reports around the clock should also be addressed as part of a broader research initiative. 6,7  ",

While the site has already generated significant interest as a publicly available surveillance tool, many improvements remain to be made for it to be a truly useful resource for both public health professionals and the general public. In particular, adding more languages and expanding our usage of general data sources such as newspapers and blogs will increase coverage and further demonstrate the value of the visualization and filtering features. Moreover, only as time progresses, as more people use the system, and further significant outbreaks unfold in the global disease ecosystem, will we know the true potential of the software, and how best to improve it.",
