            "text": "On March 11, 2020, Director-General of World Health Organization, Dr T.A. Ghebreyesus, declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of pandemic concern. Even though the Italian Government established and implemented extraordinary measures for a Western democracy to limit viral spread for its entire population, in what's been referred to as a \"lockdown\", Italy has had 86498 confirmed cases as of March 27. The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy rose in the last 24 hours by 919e9134, overtaking the total number of deaths so far registered in China. Nevertheless, the national health system is proving to be extraordinary. Many doctors and nurses are working without rest since Feb 20th and are voluntarily taking on extra jobs, making us Italians proud, and in doing so around 10% (n \u00bc 6414) of them have become infected, and 51 have died. Therefore, in order to reduce the viral spread as far as possible, the current limited medical resources and the medical personnel should be rationally employed for creating a high-quality and extremely safe environment to protect both patients and healthcare workers. Additionally, since the real problem of Italian health system is the lack of adequate intensive care facilities, the number of clinical departments that are open to patients in need of cure other than COVID-19 has been cut in half. As a result, all elective surgical procedures have been postponed ensuring intensive care facilities available. Chinese surgeons have recently published a proposal for treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China [1] . On the same line, it is imperative to provide general recommendations within a tertiary referral center for surgical oncology for maintaining high quality cancer care in an extremely safe working environment.",
