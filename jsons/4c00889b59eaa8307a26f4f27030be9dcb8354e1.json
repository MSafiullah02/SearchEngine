            "text": "While there are many examples along the spectrum of public health censorship, this paper's discussion of the benevolent health worm will be limited to that of the Peoples' Republic of China (China) drawing on three public health crises: HIV/AIDS, SARS and Avian Influenza. In each of these situations, Chinese citizens faced a public health epidemic (which then spread to the international community). In each of these situations the Chinese government heavily censored information, allowing the disease to unnecessarily spread faster in an uncontained manner. And in each of these situations individuals who vocalized or published unauthorized news articles on the epidemic (many prominent experts, doctors and activists) were detained without reason serving time in prison. Some were threatened or charged with divulging a state secret. The author uses China by way of example due to the extremity of the example, as well as her experience and familiarity with politics, censorship strategy and legal developments in the region. 1 The use of a controversial technology such as a computer worm to disseminate uncensored, sanctioned public health information in China presents contentious ethical issues worth examining. When is the use of an illegal technology ethical? Does the dual use of a computer worm for malicious or benevolent reasons play a part in the analysis? If so, at what point? Is motivation the determining factor? Intended use? Actual consequences? Is there a moral duty to write and disseminate public health information which differs from authorized accounts? Is the duty a general duty or is it specific to certain members of society? Does the mode of information delivery play a part in an ethical analysis? Are anonymous modes of dissemination less ethical than methods which provide accountability? To what extent does the source of the information factor into the equation? What role does risk of criminal sanction play in ethics? Does the risk of criminal sanction depend on the actual use or potential consequences of the technology? Does the violation of human rights justify the illegal activity? If so, is the Chinese context justifiable? Is the use of a benevolent worm compatible with Western ethical traditions? Chinese ethical traditions? The above questions are raised to illustrate the abundance of ethical queries triggered by the topic, and are not meant to be fully covered in this paper.",

            "text": "For the purpose of this paper, an account will be given of the censorship environment in China both in general and in the specific context of public health. This will be followed by an account of technical aspects of the benevolent health worm inasmuch as it will inform and frame the debate on ethical issues. A further account will be given examining the use of an illegal technology such as a computer worm to disseminate non-authorized public health information. The core of the paper will examine ethical issues in a general fashion, and then in a specific manner drawing on the moral philosophy of Confucianism and Western notions of civil liberties/human rights. Confucianism is often thought to be incompatible with Western rights-based theories (democracy, civil liberties, human rights and other autonomous rights based theories). The point is not to justify the benevolent health worm through either a 'western' or 'eastern' lens. The point, rather, will be to examine many of the ethical issues from multiple perspectives. In particular, the perspective of Chinese moral philosophy -Confucianism -which is rooted within the framework of values and duties -will be used along side a Western human rights-based analysis. 2 The use of Western rights-based theories (human rights) alongside the Eastern duty-based theory of Confucian moral philosophy provides an interesting platform for an ethical analysis of the benevolent health worm. The author will suggest how human rights and Confucian moral philosophy may be used to better understand the ethical issues presented with the use of the benevolent health worm. The paper does not aim to justify the use of the benevolent worm. Instead, there is the modest aim to initiate ethical debate on the subject. The application of the analysis could extend to a broader examination of benevolent payloads, and, further along the spectrum, the ethical use of illegal technologies.",

Using censorship as a control mechanism has historically been pitted against the Chinese promotion of intellectual growth. 3 The rise of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) brought with it the continued ideal of control over the dissemination of works and ideas. China continues to censor books, newspapers, and basically, most forms of publications that threaten the governing regime or criticize China's attitude towards human rights. 4 Included in this overall censorship strategy is tight control of the media and the Internet.",

Review and enforcement of laws and regulations is performed by two agencies (one for press, radio, film and television, and the other for written publications including the Internet), both of which are run by the Communist Party's Central Propaganda Department (CPD). Against the backdrop of what could best be described as a labyrinth of laws and regulations, the CPD issues weekly informal directives to news agencies and Internet Service Providers (e.g. Google and Microsoft) on news items requiring restrictive coverage. Virtually all statutes and regulations concerned with communications (news or otherwise) contain vague language allowing authorities sufficient flexibility in determining which publications are in breach of the law. 5 Navigating through the ever-changing and complex media and Internet regulations is a seemingly never-ending process. While the regulations are ever-changing, there is a standard set of vaguely written provisions which appear in all such regulations: divulging state secrets; harming the honour or interests of the nation; spreading rumours which may disturb social order; and inciting illegal assemblies which could disturb social order -all punishable as a criminal offence. State secrets provisions are the most problematic as their wording and interpretation in practice has proven malleable to political will. It is difficult for writers (whether they be journalists or mere bloggers) to determine in advance whether their message would contravene the law.",

Historically, individuals who reported and disseminated sanctioned public health news were often detained without reason and, in some cases, these individuals were charged with divulging a 'state secret'. Many academics and experts have written on the scope of 'state secret' in China. The notion of 'state secret' has traditionally been broad and deliberately ambiguous, while its scope of application is ever-changing. 7 It remains impossible to ascertain whether a person's actions would fall within a 'state secret'. People have been charged with this serious offence for the dissemination of banned information related to human rights, revealing draft laws (white papers), publishing unauthorised news reports, and publishing information critical of governing authorities. The act of circumventing the ''Great Firewall'' for illicit purpose, and mere research on Internet censorship, could conceivably fall within the parameters of 'state secret'. The CCP's unpredictable use of broad, ambiguous laws to deter freedom of expression is heavily criticized in the international arena. While 'state secret' laws remain a potent threat, the CCP has a number of criminal provisions which it regularly uses to curtail the dissemination of sanctioned information. To paraphrase a prominent Malaysian journalist Steve Gan, ''We have the right of freedom of expression. The problem is that we have no rights once such words are freely expressed.'' 8 The same could be said of China.",

These activists reported significant rates of people infected HIV and campaigned for the government to take proactive measures to reduce the spread of this debilitating disease. Many AIDS activists, including the famous activist Wan Yanhai, have been detained and charged with divulging a state secret. 10 Infected blood supplies appear to have initially been the main source of the problem. Infected blood supplies, however, still taint China with many people in poorer areas donating blood for money while drug use, prostitution and a lack of educative measures continue to exacerbate the situation.

Authorized access entails individuals having to obtain licenses for Internet access. In order to obtain a license, individuals are required to register with the local police and provide their names, the names of their service provider, their e-mail addresses, and list any newsgroups in which they participate. This, of course, does not mean that anonymity and pseudonymity cannot be achieved for Chinese cybersurfers. Users have flocked to cybercafe\u00b4s and universities to access the web. The CCP has responded by shutting down many cyber-cafe\u00b4s, then later by requiring all cybercafe\u00b4s and universities to obtain user identification, and to keep detailed logs of user activities (the regulations are complex and comprehensive). The extent to which such entities have fully complied with the law in practice has not been explored, but the threat of surveillance continues to lead to an environment of self-censorship.

The regulations require ISPs to restrict and control access to harmful/banned websites, allow surveillance software on their systems, and keep logs of user activity. 19 Email is neither private nor anonymous when using an ISP regardless of whether a domestic or foreign service is used. ISPs must and do comply with requests to reveal personal information of the true identity of users as well as information about email content. For example, both Yahoo!China and Yahoo!HK have disclosed confidential user information of prominent journalists by releasing Internet protocol addresses to Chinese authorities. Many journalists deliberately have email accounts in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong with a strong rule of law tradition in order to shield their identities from Chinese authorities. Yahoo!HK handed over the Internet protocol address (not the user's name) of journalist Shi Tao to Chinese authorities based merely on an informal request. As such, Yahoo!HK circumvented formal judicial requirements of a court order compelling the disclosure of confidential information. Yahoo!HK claims that they disclosed the information in compliance with a criminal investigation in Mainland China. The dispute has become one of many disputes over the scope of Chinese jurisdiction in Hong Kong. Disclosure of an Internet protocol address is not classified as personal information under Hong Kong law making it safe for ISPs to circumvent their otherwise legal obligation to keep personal information confidential under the Privacy Ordinance. The securing of Shi Tao's Internet protocol address led the Chinese authorities directly to a specific computer port number, and directly to Shi Tao's computer. The information was classified in China as state secret. Shi Tao was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail. 20 Recent popular methods for dissemination of taboo/illegal documents include spam, weblogs and chatrooms -all delivery methods involving the Internet which allow for some degree of anonymity or . 18 The precise number of gateways has not been established.

China's filtering/anti-spam technology has likewise greatly evolved so that spam has become a less effective means of communicating information. Those who continue to engage in the exchange of banned communications, whether it be via spam, weblogs, text message or other fora, potentially face criminal charges.

Malware typically includes the following types of computers programs: virus, worm, Trojan horse, spyware, adware, spam, bot/agent, zombie, exploit, bug, keylogging and so forth. Malware refers to computer software which either acts maliciously or whose effects are malicious -the two are not necessarily synonymous. In a wider context, malicious would extend to any type of computer code installed without consent regardless if any damage occurs to the computer. The theory is that the malicious component encompasses the use of bandwidth and again, that there is no consent. The idea of a benevolent virus or worm is not novel. Early research and debate focused on the use of a worm to patch existing security flaws in software. 22 Expressed more precisely by leading IT expert Bruce Schneier, ''Patching other people's machines without annoying them is good; patching other people's machines without their consent is not \u2026 Viral propagation mechanisms are inherently bad, and giving them beneficial payloads doesn't make things better.'' 23 Under this definition, no malware could be construed as benevolent. The weakness of this argument is that its discussion has been limited to patching and similar e-commerce activities, where consent is desirable from a corporate ethics perspective and is necessary in order to conclude a binding legal contract. Missing from this discussion is the application of a benevolent worm outside of the e-commerce realm, along with the discussion of the difference between consent and informed consent, the latter being the legal requirement in most jurisdictions.",

It has been argued that consent is given in most Internet applications through checking the ''I Agree'' button of end-user license agreements and privacy policy statements. This is not representative of informed consent. Most users do not read end-user-license agreements (EULA). When they do, such licenses contain onerous obligations unilaterally imposed on them expressed in complex, aggressive legal rhetoric -most of these types of terms remain untested in law and run against the basic tenants of the law of contracts, namely consideration, meeting of the minds, and adequate notice of change of terms. This is perhaps best illustrated by way of example. Many corporations, such as Sony, release products with an end-user license term authorizing them to utilize rootkits, backdoors and digital rights management systems for a variety of unspecified purposes, all of which may be subject to change without notification to the user. The rootkits, in turn, render computers vulnerable to intruders to install malicious applications onto their computers. Digital rights management systems allow monitoring devices which track the use of a work (for example, a music c.d.), which could theoretically be used as evidence to bring legal suits against those who make illegal use of the copyrighted work. The author uses the example of consent to illustrate the discrepancy between tangential concepts of theory and practice. The author agrees that informed consent is a desirable feature in software distribution mechanisms. Concluding that consent is required in all contexts is to prematurely rule on an issue which has, so far, only been discussed in the limited context of electronic commerce.",

Within the confines of benevolent payloads, there is an assumption that lack of consent is inherently bad or unethical contrasted with acts where a vague notion of consent is obtained, thereby magically summoning the requisites of legal and ethical action.

A common flaw of these methods is the necessity of a positive act by both the sender and recipient of information. This is especially so for the first two means. A positive act, whether it is through technical (e.g. virus) or manual (e.g. forward spam message) would allow for the possibility of dual criminal charges. Meanwhile there are further challenges with the latter two distribution means of foreign spam and web proxies. As pre-eminent human rights activist Sharon Om has noted, human rights spamming lists are potentially illegal under the United States Can Spam Act. 27 The use of anonymizing technologies such as web proxies is by no means fool proof. Such technologies are capable of being blocked (policy choice not a technical feat), even trust-enabled web proxies such as psiphon. 28 In the case of the benevolent health worm, only the sender of the information would perform a positive act.

Is China within its legitimate sovereign right to censor free speech on public health issues on the grounds that such discourse falls under the exemption of ''national security''? Is civil disobedience justified in the context of disobeying the law for a higher purpose whether it be construed as a moral obligation or interpreted as for the greater good of the community (emphasis here on worm created within China)?

In order to protect free speech rights, legislative limitations on censorship powers are necessary. In a rights-respecting society, balancing involves prioritizing different rights in the case of conflicts between prima facie rights (e.g. Freedom of expression may conflict with freedom of religion). In the case of liberal democracies, there should be strong limitations on violations of freedom of expression and liberty. On the other hand, as we have seen in the quotation from Reed, above, from the perspective of the PRC, rights are merely instrumental to the common good, and balancing rights can be done by determining what maximizes the common good. Rights can be overridden whenever the common good requires. 35 Under public international law, governments are allowed to restrict the free flow of information to protect interests such as national security or public morals. National security ideology has, however, been used by authorities to justify human rights infringement. For this reason, international documents and principles were developed to keep rights exemptions confined to narrow determinations. For example, the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information 36 adopt a standard whereby freedom of expression and access to information may only be restricted where a number of conditions are met: prescribed by law, protects a legitimate national security interest, and is necessary in a democratic society. For example, a legitimate national security interest is incitement to violent overthrow of a government. National security restrictions are not justifiable in the case, for example, of ''embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing, or to conceal information about he functioning of its public institutions \u2026'' (principle 2(b)). China's restrictions on free speech and access to information clearly do not adhere to the Johannesburg Principles or other international standards for protecting the right to information. As Human Rights Watch notes, ''Prior censorship in particular is severely disfavoured in international law, and not permitted in many constitutional systems. A decision to block access to online material should be subject to the highest level of scrutiny, with a burden on the government to demonstrate that censorship would effectively avert a threat of irreparable, imminent, and weighty harms, and that less extreme measures are unavailable as alternatives to protect the state interest at issue. At present, it seems apparent that China engages in no such scrutiny \u2026 '' 37 Moreover, the decision to punish certain speakers merely for exercising their right to speak frankly online (or off) is arbitrary and unpredictable with no opportunity for an individual or group to know in advance whether their actions comport with the law. The inability to comply with the law based on a lack of transparency severely undermines any attempt to posit a law as moral. Morality here is used in a procedural sense along the line of natural law theorist, Lon Fuller's essential principle that the law should be written and promulgated in a fashion which guides behaviour.",

The first is better known as 'conscientious objection' where the moral agent performs or abstains from performing an act to preserve the agent's own moral integrity. There is only the duty to obey a just law. Fashioned in a similar vein, there may in fact be a moral obligation to disobey an unjust law. 38 In the case of the benevolent worm, a number of parties including the author/producer, and sender/distributor may feel morally compelled to send what they believe is vital, accurate health information otherwise not available within China. Conjecturing on the moral agent's dilemma, the agent is motivated to break the law in order to achieve a number of possible goals such as informing the populace of important news related to the epidemic and to encourage behaviour associated with containing the disease in question. 39 35 G. Hagen and A. Maurushat, Surveillance, Technology, and National Security: Issues in Civil Liberties, Course Materials. Asia-America Institute in Transnational Law, 2005. 36 Available at http://hei.unige.ch/humanrts/instree/ johannesburg.html. 37 Human Rights Watch, footnote 21. 38 Martin Luther King Junior, for example, writes: ''How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?'' The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws: there are just and there are unjust laws. I would agree with Saint Augustine that ''An unjust law is no law at all.'' ''\u2026 One who breaks an unjust law must do it openly, lovingly \u2026 and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law.' ' (1963) The other type of disobedience, on the other hand, is known as 'civil disobedience' in the sense that it, ''is conscientious disobedience of the law directed primarily \u2026 at bringing about a change in a law, policy, institution that is morally unjust or otherwise morally unacceptable ... or a law which may be acceptable in itself but which is disobeyed in order to protest against the offending law.'' 40 The moral agent, in this instance, is motivated to affect change in the law. In the case of the benevolent worm, however, this would likely be a possible ancillary effect rather than a primary goal.",

Another ground speaks to a utilitarian approach of bringing about useful reconsideration of public policy, respect for human rights, interests of minorities and disadvantages groups, and actual reform of the law. It has been shown that other methods such as news reporting and spam potentially create harm not only for the sender but also for the recipient of sanctioned health information. The benevolent worm has the goal of safely minimizing harm to the sender and attempts to eliminate harm to the recipient (realizing, of course, that unintended consequences are not always foreseeable). Many philosophers have specified that justifiable civil disobedience ought to be non-violent with the agent ready and willing to accept punishment as a consequence for breaking the law. This view seeks to disassociate civil disobedience from revolutionary disobedience. The author suggests that this dichotomy is more useful in a democratic state with rule of law whose political leaders and citizens first have respect for their Constitutions and second for human rights in general. The dichotomy, therefore, seems less appropriate for autocratic states with documented histories of human rights abuse.",

While China has overcome many hurdles to better provide for its people, its record on factors contributing to human dignity is poor (freedom of expression, protection of minorities, access to important and timely information, and so forth). It is within this limited latter context of human dignity that it is conceivable to characterize governance as poor.

Certain societal members may include scholars, doctors, journalist, experts, NGOs, and other international organizations. This bears a resemblance to justifications of the moral agent in conscientious disobedience. The dissemination of vital information is potentially a virtuous act whether it is through direct means of an Internet website, news publications, or whether it is less direct through a benevolent health worm. Of course, the opposite could be argued for those who adhere to a traditional view of Confucian moral philosophy. It becomes more difficult to justify the benevolent worm in the absence of one of the five relationships giving rise to duties. The most relevant relationship to the benevolent worm is that of ruler and subject. The ruler-subject relationship is predicated on the subject's respect for the ruler. This is similar to chung, loyalty to the State. Again, there is the assumption that the ruler will have ren, and will act as an example to his subjects. In the absence of ren, the subject duty to obey the ruler is lessened.

Benevolent payloads have in the past been analysed in the context of patches and e-commerce. Conclusion has been reached in the wider technological community that benevolent payloads are simply a 'bad idea' because there is no consent, and there are safer methods available. There has been no analysis of benevolent payloads outside of the electronic commerce context. The benevolent health worm provides an interesting case study which undermines and challenges many of the ethical issues of benevolent payloads. This article has attempted to untangle many of the complex ethical issues surrounding the benevolent health worm, and benevolent payloads in general.",
