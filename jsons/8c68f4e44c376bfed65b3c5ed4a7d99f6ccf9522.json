MRI improves soft tissue delineation and greater accuracy in 339 creation of a HR-CTV for cervical brachytherapy 82,83 . It would be reasonable to perform CT-based 340 planning for patients with cervix-confined local disease and those with limited vaginal involvement (T1b-341 2a) and reserve MRI-based planning for patients with extracervical spread of disease where delineation 342 of gray zones would be most impacted as with parametrial, uterine body, mid/distal vagina, bladder or 343 rectal invasion (T2b-T4a). 344 For those patients where MRI is felt to improve their treatment delivery relative to risk of 345 COVID, responsible utilization of MRI is necessary. MRI with applicator in situ for each fraction or 346 application is ideal but may not be possible within the construct of each institution's workflow and 347 access to resources, and this is especially the case in the era of COVID-19. There are experiences with 348 performing MRI-based brachytherapy with the applicator in situ while keeping the patient as an 349 inpatient and delivering treatment in 2 applications 84,85 . This strategy can be amended to perform all 350 brachytherapy in a single well-placed application to avoid multiple admissions. For outpatient scenarios, 351 a pre-brachytherapy MRI can be done and incorporated with CT done at time of implant. With this 352 utilization, the MRI resulted in significant alterations in the HR-CTV in about 50% of cases compared to 353 CT alone in patients with parametrial invasion (T2b & T3b) 86 . 354 Pre-brachytherapy MRI has been fused to a CT at time of implant using deformable image 355 registration (DIR) as well. The GTV can be contoured on the MRI and HR-CTV on the MRI-CT fusion after 356 DIR 87 ; however, limitations exist with this approach and should be recognized with clinical 357 implementation 88 .
