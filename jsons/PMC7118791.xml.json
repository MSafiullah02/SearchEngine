A synthesis of the major gaps found and recommendations made in past reviews of Canada's health surveillance provided guidance. It reflected the complexities inherent to surveillance systems plus those attributable to Canada's decentralized data collection across federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) levels and the local/municipal level.4 Some of the recommendations included: (1) the need for better coordination among the various participants in surveillance activities; (2) more consistent use of surveillance data to inform policy and programme decision making; (3) full exploitation of administrative and clinical databases, including electronic health records, for their rich data supply; and (4) consideration of the needs of customers/users of surveillance systems and products in the design of surveillance systems.4, 5\n",

Surveys are also conducted in workplaces, schools and municipalities to relate a person's environment to physical activity levels.
