            "text": "Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a highly contagious avian coronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, genus Gammacoronavirus. IBV infects primarily domestic fowl causing disease associated with respiratory signs, and in some cases with kidney lesions and proventriculitis, resulting in increased mortality in unprotected birds and in serious economic losses (Cook et al., 2012). There is a wide variety of genetically distinct IBV genotypes; some have been continuously detectable since suitable typing techniques were developed, some have appeared, briefly caused a problem and then disappeared, some proved restrained to a particular geographical area, some widespread (Cook et al., 2012; Jackwood et al., 2012). The control of the disease occurs mainly by vaccination using live attenuated homologous vaccines (Geerligs et al., 2011; Jackwood et al., 2003), or a combination of two antigenically distinct live attenuated vaccines (Jackwood et al., 2012; Jordan, 2017; Terregino et al., 2008). Effective knowledge of the prevalence and circulation of different IBV genotypes is needed to decide upon the most effective vaccination protocol. However, this decision is complicated by the circulation and thus presence of the very live vaccines applied for disease control. For example, withdrawal of IBV 793/B (lineage GI-13) live vaccine in Northern Italy led to the disappearance of this previously thought ubiquitous genotype, suggesting that IBV 793/B virulent strains were absent in the area (Franzo et al., 2014a).",

            "text": "IBV detection is commonly performed using TaqMan\u00ae RT-qPCR assays (Callison et al., 2006). IBVs\u2019 differentiation and genotyping rely on serological analyses and/or on RT-PCR followed by sequencing of full or partial S1 gene, which, due to its variability and biological function, is the region commonly targeted for this purpose (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Worthington et al., 2008). However, they both represent expensive and/or time-consuming methodologies. SYBRgreen RT-qPCR paired with melting curve analysis represents a more economic and time-effective strategy for IBV genotyping and for the differentiation between vaccine and field strains in a single analysis. Using this approach genotyping and/or vaccine differentiation relies on sequence variants identification based on their individual melting temperatures, a strategy successfully applied for typing of other avian viruses (Franzo et al., 2014b; Pham et al., 2005; Steer et al., 2011). However, due to the high number of IBV genotypes (or lineages) (Valastro et al., 2016) and the lack of vaccine markers for most of IBV vaccines (Listorti et al., 2017) the development of effective SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assays represents a challenge for any research group embarking in this task.",

            "text": "Here we explored SYBRgreen RT-qPCR paired with melting curve analysis to a) distinguish between IBV field strains and homologous attenuated live vaccine and b) support multiplexing towards the differentiation between IBV genotypes. Comparison of the full genome sequences of vaccine Poulvac IB QX (Zoetis) and its progenitor 1148-A identified several vaccine markers, including three consecutive nucleotide changes in the S1 gene (Listorti et al., 2017). Those unique vaccine markers affecting the GC content of the target region were targeted to develop a SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay enabling the differentiation of vaccine Poulvac IB QX from QX-like field strains via melting curve analysis. Next we developed a multiplex assay for the simultaneous genotyping of IBV Mass-type (lineage GI-1) and IBV QX-like (lineage GI-19) strains, as those two genotypes represent a major threat for the poultry industry worldwide (Cook et al., 2012; de Wit et al., 2018; Jackwood et al., 2012). To achieve this, specific primer sets were designed and RT-qPCR and SYBRgreen analysis settings were optimized in order to detect and differentiate the sequence variants of interest. Both the simplex and the multiplex approaches proved reliable and effective diagnostic tools, showing excellent sensitivity, specificity and repeatability within and between runs. The application of these protocols will aid in the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of IBV and they represent proves of principle for future developments and applications of melting curve analyses towards IBV diagnosis.",

Poulvac IB QX (Zoetis) is a live attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus derived from QX-like field strain IB 1148-A after serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) (Geerligs et al., 2011). IBV M41 strain was kindly provide by GD Animal Health (Deventer, The Netherlands); the virus was isolated from birds showing respiratory sings and drop in egg production. Nobilis\u00ae IB H120 (MSD/Animal Health, Boxmeer, The Netherlands) is a live attenuated avian infectious bronchitis Mass-type vaccine. For each virus a stock was produced. Briefly, ten 8-day-old specific pathogens free (SPF) ECEs were inoculated with a 50 % embryonic infectious dose (EID50) of 100, incubated for 48 h, and cooled at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h prior to harvesting and pooling of the allantoic fluid (AF). Viruses titration was performed in 8-day-old ECEs by determining the EID50 per ml at 7 days post infection (dpi) according to the Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938). RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid using QIAamp viral RNA minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.",

QX-specific oligo pairs were designed to amplify the portion of S1 gene containing the two transversion (G\u2192T) affecting the GC content of the gene, hence affecting also the melting temperature of the amplicon. To confirm the higher GC content in QX-like field strains detected worldwide, the multiple sequence alignment was trimmed to include solely the target region. For easiness of analysis, the dataset was processed with cd\u2010hit\u2010est test of the CD\u2010HIT Suite (http://weizhong-cluster.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd = cd-hit-est) (Li and Godzik, 2006) to cluster sequences that shared 100 % identity, such as each cluster represents a unique prototype sequence. The resulting unique prototype sequences were processed using uMELT Melting Curve Predictions Software (https://www.dna.utah.edu/umelt/umelt.html) to compare the predicted melting curve of vaccine Poulvac IB QX to those of the field strains. Eventually, the specificity of the oligo pairs was assessed using Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) (Jian et al., 2012).
