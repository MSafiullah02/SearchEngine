Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August 2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days. This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if the periods of no-isolation days are",

Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of symptomatic individuals due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus with respect to no isolation and hard social isolation policies.

The federal government is reluctant to implement nationwide policies, disclaiming that the negative economic effects are too steep and that social distancing is an erroneous choice The Lancet (2020); the government suggests that the economy cannot stop and that herd immunity could be a solution to this pandemic. The expected impacts of the disease in Brazil are catastrophic Ismael et al.; Rocha Filho et al. (2020) . Moreover, due to lack of testing, Brazil is only accounting for patients with severe symptoms or those how have died; therefore, a huge percentage of sub-notification (over 90 %) has been reported Silva et al.

The application of the MPC feedback without the uncertain realization of the model can lead to performances which may borderline the use of the available ICU beds in the country, i.e. the nominal prediction model may give a result in terms of infections which is less than what is observed in practice.

One cannot use the models derived with the parameters presented in Table 1 as if they would not change along time. The correct measure is to take into account uncertainty-embedded models, performing the identification procedure detailed in Section 3 every day (when new datasets are available). Such adaptive control procedure (with model tuning and model-based control optimization) would be much more prudent, requiring constant measuring, monitoring, parameter estimation and control computations. As discussed by K\u00f6hler et al. (2020) , feedback is utterly necessary to ensure a reliable handling of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

For such, the weighting matrices Q I and Q u are taken to imply an adequate trade-off between peak reduction and social isolation. Since the occupancy rate of ICU beds in the country dating 20/05/08 is considerably high, we chose Q I = 0.9 and Q u = 0.1, which means that the MPC makes \"more effort\" to reduce the amount of infected individuals then to restore a no-isolation policy, which is reasonable considering the observed situation. The control horizon is fixed as N p = 60 days (the MPC makes predictions for two-months ahead of each sampled k, day). Firstly, we show the results for N m = 2, 5 and 7 days of the minimal days in each state condition. The decision by the MPC optimization and the resulting enacted social isolation measure (\u03c8) are shown in Figure 5 . The resulting effects on the amount of symptomatic individuals is shown in Figure 6 . We must state that, for N m \u2264 7 days, the amount of shifting in the observed social isolation variable is quite intense. Furthermore, the obtained results with these values for N m were not enough to reduce the infection peak, as observed. Note that this kind of policy would hardly ever be implementable, since a confusing message would be passed to the society. The frequent changing between isolation or noisolation would not be strictly followed, which is certainly unwanted. Therefore, these results are not considered as practical or viable.
