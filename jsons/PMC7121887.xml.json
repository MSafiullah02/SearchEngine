Currently, most of the detection systems used to monitor binding of biological molecules on sensor surface need some fluorescent or enzymatic labeling. This labeling step charges additional cost and time to the bioanalysis. The other concerned problem regarding this type of analysis is that, in some cases, the labeling reagent itself interferes with the analyte molecule, which then leads to false measurements. This makes the analysis more complex and less reliable. Considering the cost, time consumption, and reliability of the measuring system, this strategy has some disadvantages in monitoring the binding of biological species at the surfaces.",

To obtain the desired information about the analyte molecule with certain degree of confidence, we have to develop suitable sensitive, selective, fast, inexpensive, and label-free detection systems. This problem needs to be addressed mainly in two parts: The first part is associated with the design of selective antibody surfaces that are capable of interacting only specifically with analyte molecules in complex matrices; and the second part is related with the design of transducer that can generate signals more sensitively for very low concentrations of analytes. Mergence of these two strategies can produce innovative detection systems, which can perform monitoring of different bioanalytes with appropriate selectivity and sensitivity.",

Although there are some other surface structuring techniques that have some applications in mass-sensitive biodetections, molecular imprinting has high repute in this regard. The imprinted polymers are of rigid and robustness nature, which is not damaged by exposing them into extreme conditions, and, in contrast, acoustic devices give a direct change in frequency corresponding to the bounded mass on their surface. Such detection systems have gained substantial importance during the last decade because of their widespread applications in different fields such as degradation analysis, compost monitoring, enantio-selective sensors, and environmental monitoring. To understand how to design highly selective surfaces for bioanalytes and for their detection by mass-sensitive devices, one should follow the concept of molecular imprinting along with other surface crafting schemes and fundamental principles of acoustic devices. In this chapter, coming sections will focus on these issues and discuss their potential applications in bioanalytics.",

The issue can be resolved by considering natural antibodies [1] as a direct tool for monitoring immunochemical reactions for detection purposes. One of the major advantages of this scheme is that natural antibodies provide sufficient degree of specificity for desired target molecule in complex mixtures. These materials can be immobilized on an appropriate transducer and be used to design biosensors [2, 3]. A very recent example of this strategy has been explained in a review article in which a thin layer of enzymes is immobilized on an electrochemical probe. This sort of detection systems has shown good results regarding sensitivity and selectivity. The major drawback of this technique is the lack of ruggedness and long-term stability of the designed surface, which limits their applications while crafting materials that can face severe conditions and retain their properties for longer period of time. The other concerned problem regarding these materials is that the interaction between antibody and antigen is usually very strong, which significantly reduces the reversibility and thus restricts their reuse.",

This technique is quite new but still promising to craft the different materials to get the desired properties such as chemical, mechanical, thermal, and biocompatibility having sufficient degree of roughness. The synthesized LBL assemblies are of robust nature, which can effectively perform in severing conditions. The stimulating feature about these materials is that the layer-to-layer attractions are not restricted to electrostatic forces but assemblies can also be formed by hydrogen bonding [6], covalent bonding [7, 8], and some hydrophobic interactions [9, 10] as well. LBL assembly methods are very advantageous to organize the surface structures at nanometer scale and to incorporate the desired biomolecules. The versatility of this strategy enables us to launch any kind of charge species such as proteins [11\u201314], polypeptides [15], DNA [16], viruses [17], antibodies [18], and various other biological compounds in thin films preparation. The introduction of different biological species in LBL assembly generates very sensitive biological receptors having tunable selectivity. The induced functionalities in thin films truly favor the production of biorecognition materials. These materials can also be patterned by fabricating different components such as nanoparticles [19], nanotubes [20], and some other nanoplates [21\u201322]. This is of course of great interest in designing the biorecognition [23] of thin films at nanoscale [24], which can be deposited on a suitable transducer to conduct various bioanalyses.",

The geometrical shape, size, and configuration of cavities can be improved for optimal template interaction by modifying the reaction conditions [30, 31] such as pressure, temperature, amount of cross linker and monomer to template proportion [32]. The amount of cross linker is very important as the higher degree of cross linking ensures the generation of cavities of very fine shape for optimal selectivity. Some post-imprinting modifications can also be employed to further improve the cavities shapes for reinclusion. The basic requirements to conduct imprinting process are the high cross linking of polymer and the noninterfering nature of template with polymer matrix. Molecular imprinting can be classified into two types, according to the interaction of monomers with template molecules (i.e., covalent and noncovalent imprinting).",

The removal of template molecules takes place very fast as it does not require any bond rupture. This is a fast and straightforward way to design recognition materials for different detection purposes or developing chemical sensors. The only requirement for this process as earlier mentioned is that the template should not interfere with polymer, so there are no more restrictions for analyte size and shape. The only drawback of this technique is that it cannot be applied to those template molecules that do not have any functional group to interact with polymer system, which limits the construction of binding sites for analyte interactions. This problem is solved by later technique in which the model compound is covalently linked with polymer chain. After polymerization, the template molecules are removed by bond rupturing between template and polymer. The imprinted polymer can rebind the analyte molecules reversibly, and the selectivity is achieved by reactive groups in polymer matrix. Covalent imprinting is no doubt a practical method to various templates not having functional group but is limited due to the small number of useful applications of reversible covalent bonding.",

            "text": "The sensitivity achieved by MIPs is accessed by number of imprinting sites available for analyte interactions (i.e., more the imprinted sites available higher will be the sensitivity). Nanoporous polymers possess more imprinted sites when compared with microporous polymers. The other important aspect regarding the sensitivity is the distribution of imprinted sites in polymer layer prior to use for detection purposes. The size of analyte molecules governs the imprinting strategy whether bulk imprinting [36] or surface imprinting is suitable [37]. In bulk imprinting (as shown in Fig. 3.2), the template molecule is added along with monomer and cross linker at the start of reaction and after polymerization is removed. This strategy is useful for relatively smaller analyte molecules having molecular mass <500 g mol\u20131 but while considering the larger analytes such as biomolecules, the bulk imprinting is not always complimentary. Although number of interaction sites in bulk imprinting are high in comparison with surface imprinting, keeping in mind the larger size of biomolecules, incomplete reversibility, relatively longer diffusion pathways, and longer time for measurement make their detection highly unfavorable. Therefore, for larger biomolecules, surface imprinting, as shown in Fig. 3.3, is proposed where template molecules are directly imprinted on the prepolymerized surface by stamping method [38] with a little force. Thus, the patterned polymer surface possesses the dimensions from one to several hundred nanometers that can exclusively extract target molecule from the complex mixture.\n",

The coupling of these components determines the velocity and amplitude of the waves that travel along the surface, and hence, make these devices a useful tool for mass sensing purposes. A typical setup for SAW resonator has been shown in Fig. 3.5. SAW devices are typically made of ST-cut quartz crystal on which comb-shaped electrodes are generated by lift off process. The distance between these comb-shaped electrodes determines the wavelength, which leads to a distinct resonance frequency of SAW devices. Although the maximum frequency achieved for SAW devices is 2.5 GHz, the analytically reported frequency for chemical sensors is about 1 GHz [42]. Such a high resonating frequency of these devices make themselves exceptionally valuable for detecting very low mass of analytes (e.g., for 430 MHz device mass changes up to 1 pg can be detected).\n",

The growth and reproduction of yeast cells largely depends upon the composition of prepared medium, humidity, and temperature that demands constant surveillance. It has been noted that during the phase of production, concentrations of different reactants are changing with the passage of time that makes the mixture more complex. Already established methods for the monitoring of yeast cells in different production processes are based on indirect measurements or some labeling techniques.

Although not all of E. coli are toxic for human beings, still some of them are a potential hazard to public health. Among the dangerous species, E. coli O157:H7 is the most fatal one, which can cause severe diseases such as diarrhea, kidney failure, and even death in certain cases. In the United States, there are about 20,000 cases [52] related to different diseases spread by E. coli annually. Therefore, accurate, quick, cost-effective, and direct determination methods are needed in order to meet the requirements of environmental monitoring and other diagnostic purposes. The development of such detection systems are highly desirable in various industrial applications particularly related to food stuff [53]. Already established methods for bacterial detection are related to culturing, microscopy, and some other biochemical test. These methods are unfit for rapid analysis and particularly inappropriate for screening purposes, where prompt decision has to be made. The latest technology such as DNA chips has solved this problem to make faster analysis and reach toward conclusion. For a very sensitive and sophisticated detection of E. coli, polymerized chain reaction (PCR) [54, 55] technique is also very useful. Mass-sensitive devices such as QCM [56, 57] and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [58] are also used for the characterization of PCR products. These detection methods are time consuming and not widely adoptable because of the high expertise required for handling. Some other sensing schemes based on electrochemical impedance [59, 60], chemiluminescence [61], SPR [62\u201364], and optical absorbance spectroscopy [65] are also reported in literature for E. coli O157:H7 detection. The direct use of mass-sensitive devices as transducer for E. coli detection [66, 67] is not very general but still good enough to give a direct change in the frequency corresponding to the binding mass of analyte.",

In literature, there are different surface techniques that have been used with mass-sensitive transducers for detection of different types of bacteria. During the last decade, different groups tried to develop various biosensors based on natural antibodies for the detection of E. coli using different transducers. Most of them had applied specific antibodies immobilized on gold electrode of piezoelectric device such as quartz crystal microbalance. The strategy is very attractive in terms of getting selectivity as natural antibodies specifically bound to particular bacteria with sufficient sensitivity. Zhihong [68] has developed interestingly an unusual strategy for mass-sensitive bacterial detection. He has exploited the carbohydrates and protein recognition interactions for a very sensitive and specific E. coli detection. This method is not purely synthetic but in fact a hybrid approach by designing suitable mannose surfaces for a rigid and strong binding of E. coli. It has been noticed that the detection of E. coli on lectin modified mannose surface has much higher sensitivity about 104 times better than mannose alone detection. This in terms of sensitivity is quite good as it improves the detection limit. As the binding of bacteria is strong that does not increase damping drastically, which is good for smooth QCM measurements without too much loss. The sensor specificity was also characterized by exposing different electrodes coated with different chemical layers to known concentration (i.e., 7.5 \u00d7 107 cells/mL of E. coli W1485). The frequency shift for different layers, that is, lectin-modified mannose layer (A) and recombinant antibody (210E scFv-cys-) treated electrode QCM surface (B) was determined. The control antigen test was also conducted by adding Staphylococcus aureus (C), and the results have been shown in Fig. 3.8. The lectin-modified sensor layer exhibits highest sensor response for E. coli W1485 in comparison with other layer and control antigen, which indicates the enhanced sensor specificity.\n",

These antibodies cannot perform for a longer period of time as they tend to deteriorate with the passage of time and so cannot be stored for long-term use. Some antibody coatings are good for sensing purpose but most of them are of a flexible nature that can cause severe damping during mass-sensitive measurements, which leads to an unreliable data both in terms of qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, some natural antibodies once bound to microorganisms then afterward they are reluctant to release them, which reduce the reversibility of mass-sensitive measurements. The solution of these problems can be made by following a different approach in which artificial recognition materials are used. Surface imprinted layers can be used as artificial antibodies [70] for bacterial detection more effectively when compared with natural antibodies. Polyurethane layers that are robust and rigid in nature have been utilized for surface imprinting of E. coli. The imprinting is done on prepolymerized surface of polyurethane with a suitable stamp made of densely packed cells. The AFM image of E. coli imprinted polyurethane surface has been shown in Fig. 3.9. These layers coated on QCM exhibit significant sensor response to E. coli. Although there was anti-Sauerbrey effect, the reported sensitivity and the reversibility of the measurement is quite good for E. coli detection. Surface studies of imprinted polyurethane layers reveal that excess of phenolic groups hindered the covalent linkage with polymer surface. This indeed is very useful to improve the imprinting effects for bacteria sensing and to develop a completely reversible detection system.\n",

This becomes highly useful for the recognition of viruses, which have size in the range of some 100 nm. Their extremely small size makes their detection virtually impossible on normal optical devices. Viruses have serious health effects on human life as they can cause various diseases such as common cold, influenza, chicken pox, and some severe ones are acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis, etc. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) [71] and PCR [72] are highly adopted methods for determining the exact stage of viral disease but their cost is too high and they need highly trained personnel to operate. Some inexpensive strips are available in the market for screening purposes for hepatitis C virus and HIV detection [73] in blood. This screening technology is of low cost and gives quick results, which are very suitable for rapid detection but these strips are limited to certain viruses and not generally available for a broad variety. At the moment, there are not much rapid and online analysis methods available for the viral detection, which have low cost, easily operable, and can be applied to a wider range of these species. This is a highly demanding task in which one has to make quick decisions about fatal viral diseases and reach a conclusion as some viral diseases are incurable and require immediate diagnosis. So, express detection systems need to be developed for fast and accurate analysis of viruses that have relatively low cost.",

The imprinted sol-gel films were examined by SEM to observe the conductivity difference between coated and uncoated quartz crystal gold electrode. They have found that the impedance of coated electrode increases with increasing layer height. Authors have also studied the other parameters such as temperature, effect of different salts and solvents on binding capacity, and concentration effect to develop an optimize detection system for HAS. The thin sol-gel films have shown suitable selectivity pattern in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and trypsin.

Erythrocytes are very flexible cells shaped like disks, having a diameter of approximately 7 \u00b5m, and a thickness of 2 \u00b5m. In previous examples, we already have knowledge of molecular imprinting for generating sensitive and selective materials for recognizing various microorganisms including bacteria and viruses. As erythrocytes have four different blood groups,A, B, O, and AB, for which molecular imprinting [96] can be handy to generate selective polymer layers capable of recognizing the respective blood group. The three blood groups, A, B, and AB, are recognized by the antigen on their surfaces and composed of oligosaccharides having six sugar molecules excluding blood group O, which has one less. The difference between blood group A and B is by only sixth sugar molecule at terminal position, whereas in the case of A, it is N-acteyl-d-galactosamine, and d-galactoside for blood group B. Molecular imprinting provides a straightforward approach to design suitable recognition materials for the detection of different blood groups on acoustic resonators. The blood groups A, B, AB, and O can be used as template model for imprinting on highly cross linked polyurethane layer. Typical polyurethane is composed of diphenyl diisocyanate as monomer, whereas bis phenol A and phloroglucinol are used as cross linkers. These cross linkers have excess of hydroxyl groups that play a very important role in imprinting as they offer suitable hydrogen bonding to the sugars present on blood group surface. Although the geometrical shapes of all these blood groups are almost identical, the predefined interaction of cells through hydrogen bonds with polyurethane surface offers suitable recognition. AFM image of imprinted erythrocytes on polymer surface have been shown in Fig. 3.15.\n",

The excess or deficiency of any hormone in the body is called hormone disorder, which can lead to severe problems in functioning of cells. Different hormones in human body can be detected by examining blood, urine, and saliva samples, according to the desired hormone test. Among different hormones, insulin is very important, which takes the glucose from blood and stocks it up as glycogen in the liver and other cells and does not allow the use of body fat as energy resource. The disorder of insulin can cause serious diseases to the body such as diabetes, insulinoma, and others. In market, synthetic insulin can be produced for diabetic patients by fermentation process governed by yeast and bacteria. So, the detection of insulin is very important not only in human body to control metabolic reactions but also highly desirable in commercial point of view. The application of artificial materials for mass-sensitive detection of insulin and other hormones is very rare. The versatility of surface imprinting makes promise to design suitable sensor materials for insulin detection [100] with a broad concentration range. Highly cross-linked polyurethane was prepared and coated on suitable mass-sensitive transducer (i.e., QCM) having 10 MHz fundamental resonance frequency. As mentioned already, solution phase stamping procedure was followed for imprinting of insulin on polyurethane surface. A series of different concentration solutions of insulin ranging from 1 \u00b5g/mL to 7 mg/mL has been exposed to imprinted channel and corresponding frequency change was monitored. It has been observed that the sensor response for different insulin solutions was linear for such a broad range, which suggests that this system can be used for quantitative determination of insulin in pharmaceutical formulations (i.e., 40 IU or 100 IU). IU stands for international unit for pharmacology activity that is 35 \u00b5g/mL of insulin.",

At all these temperatures, same concentration of insulin (i.e., 1 mg/mL) was used for analysis. It has been observed that the frequency shift is highest for that measurement, which was conducted at 25\u00b0C and then gradually decreases until at 95\u00b0C where it is lowest. Although the concentrations are same, the effect is different at different temperatures. This is probably due to the denaturing of insulin in which the structural features and functionality is lost, which ultimately cuts down the surface interactions between the analyte and the polymer layer. It signifies that by selecting proper storage temperature, the shelf life of insulin drugs can be enhanced. These findings are very significant for monitoring the quality of insulin products in pharmaceutical industry (Fig. 3.17).\n",

Major catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, which are excreted in urine. Disorder in this hormone can lead to serious complications in the central nervous system. The detection of these hormones can be made by fluorescent technique and other methods such as ion exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatorgraphy (HPLC), where different catecholamines are isolated and characterized from urine samples. Suitable sensor materials can be generated through molecular imprinting for selective detection of catecholamines in a complex urine solution. Tzong et al. [102] designed such materials by imprinting dopamine and developed a suitable sensor system using QCM as transducer. Authors have synthesized dopamine MIP powder and examined their binding properties at different pH values by HPLC studies. Dopamine MIP films were also generated by following a different reaction route and the effect of pH was also monitored on rebinding capacity of these films. These studies reveal that dopamine imprinted film preferably binds dopamine when compared with norepinephrine and epinephrine. Similarly other catecholamine imprinted films (i.e., norepinephrine and epinephrine) specifically bind the original imprint molecule as shown in Table 3.4. Dopamine MIP layer coated on 9 MHz quartz exhibits maximum frequency shift for dopamine itself, while for norepinephrine and epinephrine it is negligible. The results are summarized in Table 3.4. These studies are valuable and encouraging in designing a suitable detection model for catecholamines.\n",

Akimitsu and Toshifumi [103] had designed molecularly imprinted meth acrylic acid (MAA) polymer for selective recognition of IAA, using 9 MHz QCM to perform mass-sensitive measurement. A series of different concentrations of IAA ranging from 10 to 200 nM has been used on imprinted and the nonimprinted QCM. The change in the frequency is linear in the defined range upon mass loading of IAA. This experiment was performed on three different QCMs to observe the relative variation in the frequency shifts on same concentrations of IAA. The reported results show a coefficient of variation for three different sensors 5.3%, 6.1%, and 8.8%, respectively, which means that there is no significant difference in their performance. This is an evidence for a sensor system to generate reproducible results. The selectivity of this sensor has also been monitored by performing measurements with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), indole, and indole-3-ethanol (IET) of same concentrations. Sensor results clearly demonstrate that the frequency change for IAA is maximum, while for IBA, indole, and IET, the response is quite low, which shows the selective nature of designed sensor material. The reason of highly selective nature of imprinted MAA polymer is could be due to the suitable electrostatic interactions between N,N-dimethylamino group from monomer to carboxylic group of IAA (Fig. 3.18).\n",

The sensitive layer was characterized by AFM and put under detection of nonylphenols where it had showed satisfactory results in low ppm concentration range. Some other examples are also reported where LBL films with QCM have proven very handy for sensitive detection of DNA strains. A very exciting example of dengue virus detection has been reported using LBL hybridized gold nanoparticles [114] as sensing element. These modified nanoparticles provide high sensitivity through QCM for the detection of dengue virus. In comparison with other polymer surfaces, nanoparticles provide more binding sites that has affinity for target analyte. SEM images give a clear picture of LBL assembling of gold nano particles on quartz surface. The modified oligonucleotide gold particles are not only sensitive for viral detection but also very specific for target specie. Along with mass-sensitive devices, they have proven themselves to be very successful for diagnostic purposes in real blood samples of dengue viral infections. Almost more than hundred countries had suffered from this virus and very high rate of causalities have been reported in different regions. Such detection methods are very encouraging in developing more effective systems that are low cost and suitable for online surveillance.",

            "text": "Considering the material designing for biosensors, molecular imprinting has shown potential for recognition of various bioanalytes including microorganisms such as yeast, bacteria, viruses, and others such as proteins, enzymes, erythrocytes, etc. The tailor-made structures of imprinted polymers provide enhanced selectivity for target analyte molecules at nanometer scale where the size, shape, and dimensions of imprinted cavities are optimized for a desired biomolecule. The most significant aspect is that molecular imprinting is virtually applicable to almost all biological species unless template does not chemically react with polymer matrix. The synthetic procedure of imprinting is much more convenient when compare with other methods that are more complex, time consuming, and relatively need expansive chemical reagents. As we have learnt from the previous study that surface imprinted polymers have very broad spectrum for biosensors when compared with other material crafting technique. Unlike natural antibodies, MIPs bind analyte molecules reversibly through weak attraction forces and thus makes reusability of these materials that can be used for several analysis. The other material designing strategies such as natural antibodies, LBL, and host\u2013guest interactions have some contributions in developing biorecognition materials but not exploited for commercial use of biosensors. The other part of biosensors concerning transducers is accomplished by acoustic or mass-sensitive devices such as QCM, which furnishes high sensitivity to designed biosensors. These devices are capable of sensing the mass of analyte in nanogram or even in picogram range (i.e., SAW devices, which are very valuable while dealing with extremely low concentrations).",

The first part of sensor design deals with imprinting technique where the analyte interactions with MIP surface need to be made better adjusting monomer cross linker ratio, establishing proper reaction conditions such as favorable solvent, temperature, and heating time. The careful monitoring of different reaction parameters not only provides maximum binding sites but also constructs template-oriented cavities for selective detection. Another very important aspect (i.e., response time) can be improved by controlling the surface structures of MIPs so that the analyte molecule readily be attached or detached without consuming much time. These modifications in synthetic receptors enhance the sensitivity and permit only target analyte to be bounded specifically with MIP surface. Concerning the reusability of the sensor materials, the template MIP interaction should be entirely reversible that can only be achieved by developing noncovalent interface.",

The fundamental resonance frequency depends on thickness of quartz sheet, which is a key parameter to amplify the mass sensing capabilities of acoustic devices. The sensitivity can be made better by producing more thin QCMs, which is not feasible from a mechanical point of view as these devices would turn out to be very fragile. This restricts the use of acoustic devices to extend the detection limits of acoustic biosensors. An alternative can be used to overcome this deficiency of acoustic resonators by introducing film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR). These devices operate in the GHz range, which is higher by a factor of 103 than typical QCM resonance frequency. They not only offer enhanced sensitivity but also exhibit fine linearity, small and compact size, and less damping loss in viscoelastic medium.",
