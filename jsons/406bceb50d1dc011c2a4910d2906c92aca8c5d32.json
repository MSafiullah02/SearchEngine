It is important to better ascertain the risk of aerosol spread before ruling it out completely. Should the main mode of transmission be due to droplets (>5 \u00b5m) and direct contact, as currently advocated, then advice on preventive measures would be adequate.",

Whether these airborne viruses comprise a sufficiently infective dose or not, has not yet been determined, although a pre-print paper suggests that they do (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062828v1). Researchers used a model to estimate that a person standing and speaking in a room could release up to 114 infectious doses per hour. These aerosolized respiratory droplets would easily infect other people if this happened in public places like a bank, restaurant or pharmacy.",

On March 10 th , members of the Skagit Valley Chorale, Washington, USA, met for a weekly rehearsal (https://www.latimes.com/worldnation/story/2020-03-29/coronavirus-choir-outbreak). They knew about the pandemic but decided that the rehearsal should proceed, with hand hygiene opportunities and social distancing. Of 60 members who attended, 45 became ill, three were hospitalised, and two died. The rehearsal took place in a reasonably sized church hall, with a heating system and some makeup air from outside. Whichever route predominates will depend on specific circumstances, such as the choir rehearsal; or the overcrowded, poorly ventilated restaurant, as described above. For droplets versus aerosol, the distinction is easily blurred. The traditionally accepted size parameters (<5 \u00b5m for aerosol; >5 \u00b5m for droplets) are not consistent with a modern understanding of aerosols. Droplets in a cough or sneeze can travel much farther than 2 m 6,7 and even without the momentum of a respiratory jet carrying them, droplets as large as 30 \u00b5m travel at least 2 m in indoor air currents, before falling to the ground. By what mechanism would intact virions encased in a 5 \u00b5m particle be deemed noninfectious when current guidance assumes that those in larger droplets, say, 30 \u00b5m, are infectious?",

More evidence will be forthcoming, as indeed it should, since the role of airborne transmission in infection has all too sadly been neglected over the years. 5 Once antimicrobial chemotherapy and vaccines arrived last century, both transmission studies and preventive measures fell by the wayside.",

            "text": "Formal investigations continue but it is unlikely that all 45 infected persons clustered around the index case or touched the same contaminated surfaces.Another outbreak supporting airborne transmission occurred in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, whereby at least ten diners contracted SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067728v1). Researchers believe that there was just one infectious but asymptomatic person within family A, at a table positioned between two other tables more than 2 metres away hosting two different family groups (B & C). Due to currents generated by air conditioning, individuals from B & C families became infected, almost certainly from inhalation of aerosols. None of the families had met previously and none had close contact during the lunch, other than sitting at the same end of the restaurant.These incidents and the work by van Doremalen et al. suggest that airborne transmission cannot be ruled out as a significant pathway for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community.4 Respiratory viruses may be simultaneously transmitted by three routes: contact; droplet; and aerosol.5",
