We shall examine in more detail below the structure and properties of the important human viruses in this group, namely measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mumps and parainfluenza viruses I-V. In brief, they are all enveloped, negative-stranded, riboviruses of helical symmetry ( Fig. 8.1 ). The genome of the paramyxoviruses is a single negative strand of RNA of molecular weight approximately 5.4 x lo6, containing the genes coding for the six known virus specific proteins. The H N (haemagglutinin-neuraminidase) F (fusion) and M (matrix) proteins are associated with the lipid membrane of the typical paramyxovirus. HN and F are glycoproteins (see below) constituting the surface spikes (see Fig. 8 .1 for typical paramyxoviruses) and M is a non-glycosylated matrix protein, underlying the viral membrane. The F protein is formed by proteolytic cleavage of a larger precursor glycosylated polypeptide F,). The three other proteins L, NP and 47K, together with the RNA, form the nucleoprotein core of the virion. The L and 47K proteins may constitute the virus RNA transcriptase enzyme, whose template is the genome RNA, complexed with NP. From the point of view of strategies of antivirals and vaccines, the RNA transcriptase enzyme and the antigenicity ( Table 8 .2) of the H N and F proteins respectively are important. In infected cells, the paramyxovirus proteins are synthesized from mRNA species which are complementary to the genome, and which appear to be monocistronic. Two major size classes of mRNA have been detecteda 35s class containing the mRNA species for the L protein, and an 18s class containing at least five mRNA species (for a summary see Ball et al., 1978) . The general strategy of replication is that of a typical negative stranded RNA virus (see Chapter 3), although whether precise details will differ between RSV, measles and mumps must await further studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1828, "end": 1846, "text": "Ball et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 150, "text": "Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 443, "end": 451, "text": "Fig. 8.1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 859, "end": 865, "text": "Fig. 8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1430, "text": "Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The virus itself, like measles, belongs to the paramyxovirus group and is a roughly spherical, enveloped RNA-containing virus, 150-200 nm in diameter ( Fig. 8 . I). The internal nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid envelope (approx. 15 nm in thickness) on which are situated the outer glycoproteins of the virion. The nucleocapsid is a flexible helical structure with a ,,RNA backbone covered with protein subunits. The RNA approximates to 7 x lo6 M.W., and would have coding capacity for at least 8 proteins. A major protein of the virus is the NP and an additional polymerase P protein is thought to be closely linked to the RNA and functioning in an RNAtranscriptase complex. A membrane or M protein is another major constituent of the virion and is assumed to contribute to the structural integrity of the virus, and is located inside the lipid envelope.

The virus spreads by aerosol and initially infects the upper respiratory tract. The incubation period varies from 7-23 days, but most commonly is 14-18 days. In experimentally infected children, virus was excreted in saliva for 2-6 days, before clinical signs of parotitis appeared and for 4 days or so after its onset. Approximately half of susceptible persons may never develop clinical signs of mumps infection, although they will commonly secrete virus and so be a source of infection for others. Clinically the disease often begins with malaise, fever and pain near the angle of the jaw. A typical swelling of the face develops within 14-18 hours and often distorts the features considerably. Often both parotid glands are affected, but there may be a delay between the onset in both glands. The patient may have difficulty in opening the mouth and there is often dryness of the throat, presumably because of reduced saliva flow from blocked salivary ducts. The temperature is often high for 2-3 days and the swelling lasts for 3 days but then subsides quickly. The most notorious complication of mumps is orchitis, developing 4-5 days after onset of the parotitis, although it may develop in the absence of preceding parotitis. The first indication is pain in the testicles, rapidly followed by swelling and tenderness. The pain may be very acute. There is often an accompanying sharp general reaction with high temperature and head- ache. Symptoms tend to subside after 3-6 days. It has been estimated that the incidence of orchitis in adult mumps varies from 1 1.6% to 66% but an average incidence of 1 in 5 is usually accepted by clinicians. Some degree of testicular atrophy is common and may occur in up to half the patients and a further, more serious, complication is sterility. It is estimated that some degree of infertility may be expected in 10% of adult patients suffering from mumps orchitis, although this may be temporary. believes that the fear of sterility following mumps has been greatly exaggerated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL ASPECTS"}, {"text": "A more important complication of mumps in children is meningitis (Kilham, 1949 , McLean et al., 1961 , Russell and Donald, 1958 , Donohue et al., 1955 and to a much lesser extent encephalitis. However, the prognosis in aseptic meningitis is extremely good, with few reports of long term sequelae. Mumps encephalitis, on the other hand, can be a severe and sometimes fatal illness (Table 8 .3). The essential lesion is demyelination, which occurs in foci distributed throughout the brain or spinal cord. Mumps virus may be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but not the brain tissue itself. Quite often the first indication is a convulsion in a young child or sudden coma in an older child or adult during the convalescent period after mumps, with a sharp rise in temperature. A less dramatic onset may include drowsiness and a change in behaviour. The extent of damage to the CNS varies considerably and some patients may recover, while others may develop paralysis. Mortality is estimated to be around 20%. The overall mortality from mumps is about 1.8 deaths per 10 000 reported cases ( Because of the relatively high incidence of subclinical mumps (Henle et al., 1948) and because patients with parotitis may be infectious even before clinical signs appear, methods of prevention based on isolation of clinical cases or quarantining of contacts are not effective. Therefore work (after the pioneering studies of Enders et al., 1946) commenced in the 1950s to develop both inactivated mumps vaccine and live attenuated vaccine (Buynak and Hilleman, 1966 , Ennis and Hopps, 1969 , Henle, 1951 , Kliachko and Maslennikova, 1957 , Stokes et al., 1967 . Because of the uncertain nature of the antigenic composition of the virus and because of the poor experience with inactivated RSV and measles vaccines (see pages 361 and 375) early experimental inactivated vaccines (although used quite successfully to immunize young army recruits) were soon superceded by live attenuated vaccines. A further negative aspect of inactivated mumps vaccine was the poor duration of immunity. A live attenuated mumps vaccine was licensed in the USA in 1968 and had been developed from a strain of mumps (Jeryl Lynn, Mumpsvox) initially isolated in fertile hens eggs and which after several passages had been adapted to chick embryo cell cultures (earlier attenuated viruses had been passaged in eggs alone and proved either underaltenuated causing mumps in recipients or overattenuated and not provoking antibody in recipients). Originally, mumps vaccine was used in a monovalent form but more recently, it has also been used in the USA in children particularly as a combined vaccine with live measles and rubella viruses , Schwarz et al., 1975 , Schell et al., 1975 , Buynak el al., 1969 . Clinical trials over the years have established that the protective efficacy ranged from 70-90% (MMWR Nov. 1982) and there was a good correlation with induction of virus neutralizing antibodies and clinical protection. The vaccine has proved to be safe in usage and no mumps-like syndrome could be attributed to the vaccine virus in controlled clinical trials in 500 or more patients including several hundred potentially susceptible adults. Similar vaccines can also be used in army recruits (Pentinnen et al., 1968) . Since licensing of the vaccine in December 1967 in the USA more than 55 million vaccine doses have been used there. Other mumps vaccines have been developed since, particularly in Japan (Isomura et al., 1973 , Hosai et al., 1970 , Yamanishi et al., 1970 . Since 1968 and the introduction of the vaccine there has been a progressive decline in the number of reported cases of mumps in the USA. Thus, in 1976 a 42% decrease on the average annual total for the years 1971-75 was noted and the incidence of mumps in the USA has now reached an all time low. In 1981 there were only 4729 cases reported, showing a 97% decline from the 185 69 1 cases in 1967.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 78, "text": "(Kilham, 1949", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 79, "end": 100, "text": ", McLean et al., 1961", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 101, "end": 127, "text": ", Russell and Donald, 1958", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 128, "end": 150, "text": ", Donohue et al., 1955", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1169, "text": "(Henle et al., 1948)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1433, "text": "Enders et al., 1946)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1553, "text": "(Buynak and Hilleman, 1966", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1577, "text": ", Ennis and Hopps, 1969", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1591, "text": ", Henle, 1951", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1625, "text": ", Kliachko and Maslennikova, 1957", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1647, "text": ", Stokes et al., 1967", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2701, "end": 2723, "text": ", Schwarz et al., 1975", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2724, "end": 2745, "text": ", Schell et al., 1975", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2767, "text": ", Buynak el al., 1969", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2866, "end": 2882, "text": "(MMWR Nov. 1982)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3263, "end": 3287, "text": "(Pentinnen et al., 1968)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3476, "end": 3497, "text": "(Isomura et al., 1973", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3498, "end": 3518, "text": ", Hosai et al., 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3519, "end": 3543, "text": ", Yamanishi et al., 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 388, "text": "(Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL ASPECTS"}, {"text": "It is important that the immunity induced by mumps vaccine should last through adulthood and this feature of the vaccine has now been clearly established.

In a large field trial, vaccine was given by subcutaneous injection in a study involving a total of 1337 children. The children were assigned to family or classroom groups or to a classroom-family group if one or more siblings in a family were also entered into a classroom included in the study.

Mumps vaccine can be of particular value to children approaching puberty and for adolescents and adults, especially males who have not had mumps in childhood. Live mumps vaccine is recommended for all children at any age after 12 months, although it is not recommended for younger infants because of persisting maternal antibodies which would interfere with virus take. Contraindications include pregnancy, since although there is no good evidence of mumps causing congenital abnormalities in humans, nevertheless, the wild virus can infect the foetus and placenta. Mumps vaccine virus has also been isolated from the placenta, although not from the foetus. Since the virus is grown in chick embryo cell culture, persons allergic to egg protein should be vaccinated with extreme caution. Persons with immune deficiency diseases or suppressed immune responses that occur with leukaemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy or during therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs or radiation should not be vaccinated. This is because the replication of mumps vaccine virus may be potentiated in patients with immune deficiency diseases. The principle strategy for removing the burden of mumps disease in the USA is through achieving or maintaining high immunization levels and CDC constantly encourage private physicians and public health clinics to carry out routine vaccination as part of the health care programme. As an example of what can be achieved, the state of Massachusetts initiated a mumps control programme and offered vaccine to [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] year olds beginning in 1969 and 1-4 year olds additionally by 1971. A saving of over $300000 is achieved when the cost of the vaccine programme is compared to the costs of avoided medical care.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MUMPS IMMUNIZATION (USA)"}, {"text": "Electron microscopy shows the virus to be 120 to 200 nm in diameter, with an envelope containing surface projections ( Fig. 8 .2) (Bloth et a]., 1963) . Attempts to identify and characterize the proteins of RSV have been hampered by several factors. Loss of infectivity during purification procedures and the fact that 80% of sucrose band-purified material is nonviral make the study of purified viral proteins difficult (Fernie and Gerin, 1980) and may account for some of the discrepancies among (Table 8 .9 and Fig. 8 .3) have been identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled RSV protein Gerin, 1982, Bernstein and Hruska, 1981) . A 90K glycoprotein and a 48K glycoprotein have been identified and suggested as surface glycoproteins based upon their removal by trypsin and detergent treatment of purified RSV. Recently, the 48K glycoprotein has been shown to be connected to a 20K protein by disulfide bonds, forming a 70K protein. The functional designation of the 90K and 70K glycoproteins has not been made. A 41 K protein is considered to be the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and a 27K protein is considered to be the matrix protein (Peebles and Levine, 1979) . Although related to paramyxoviruses, RSV does not possess similar biochemical markers such as a haemagglutinin or neuraminidase activity. Like the paramyxoviruses, however, RSV promotes cell-cell fusion, accounting for the characteristic giant cell syncytia formation that is seen when the virus is grown in permissive cell lines. The ability to form syncytia permits the spread of virus by fusion of infected cells to adjacent noninfected cells. It is presumed that a surface protein of the virion is responsible for the fusion process, as has been demonstrated with other paramyxoviruses. In an attempt to define the so-called fusion protein of RSV, Walsh and Hruska (1 983) produced six monoclonal antibodies directed against respiratory syncytial virus proteins. Each was characterized by immunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence. One was directed against the nucleocapsid protein, N P 44, two were directed against a 3 7 k protein, two were directed against the 70K envelope protein, VP70 (Table 8 .10). Indirect immunofluorescence stain patterns of infected HEp-2 cells defined G P 90 and VP 70 as viral proteins expressed on the cell surface, whereas NP 44 and the 37K protein were detected as intracytoplasmic inclusions. One of the anti-GP 90 antibodies neutralized virus only in the presence Peeples and Levine, 1979; Veba, 1980; Cash et al., 1979; Belshe et al., 1977 of complement, but did not inhibit cell-cell fusion.

Although G P 90 of RSV does not possess haemagglutinating or neuraminidase activity, it is reasonable to suspect that it also might function in cell attachment. The inability to neutralize RSV with two anti-GP 90 monoclonal antibodies does not negate this possibility (Walsh and Hruska, 1983) .

The virus is ubiquitous in both temperate and tropical climates and may cause epidemics of bronchiolitis in infants for several weeks during the winter. Infants tend to shed virus for up to 3 weeks and so may be an important focus of infection even after leaving hospital. RSV can cause a mild upper respiratory tract infection or a severe attack of acute bronchiolitis.

However, more recent data, summarized by , indicates that natural infection induces a state of partial immunity to re-infection detectable for at least one year. Also RSV-caused bronchiolitis and pneumonia occurred more often in the first four months of life when maternally transmitted antibody was at high levels. Nevertheless, following preliminary studies of a formalin inactivated RSV vaccine in adults, the vaccine was used to immunize children in a local authority home. The vaccine utilized the Bernett strain of RSV isolated originally in HEK (human embryo kidney) cells and passaged 3 times in HEK cells and 10 times in vervet MK cells. M K cell harvests were clarified by filtration, inactivated with formalin, and safety tested in animals and tissue cultures. The vaccinated and control groups were comparable in age, sex and race and there were no significant side effects following immunization. The vaccine was immunogenic and 96% of children who lacked CF antibody subsequently developed antibody after 1-3 injections. (In the 7 children tested, relatively high levels of neutralizing antibody also developed.) Approximately 9 months later a sharp outbreak of RSV occurred in the home. Virus was recovered from 4 1 x of 146 residents and serological evidence of infection was detected in 9204 of 40 seronegative residents. The vaccine not only failed to induce protection but induced an exaggerated and altered clinical response to RSV in the younger vaccinees. Nine of 13 vaccinated children (6-23 months of age) developed pneumonia compared to 4 of 47 non-vaccinated children (Table 8 .1 1). Five of these 13 vaccinated children developed pneumonia serious enough to require hospitalization, whereas none of the 47 non-vaccinated children were hospitalized. This paradoxical effect of vaccination was not observed in Arthur Cottage which housed older children (24-65 months of age), but lack of protection against illness was observed. Kapikian et al. (1969) considered that the failure to produce protection in the older children may have been due to poor induction of locally produced IgA antibody as observed previously with parainfluenza type I virus infections, whereas the enhanced clinical effect noted in younger infected children may have resulted from interaction of serum antibody and RSV antigen in the lungs of children who lacked respiratory tract IgA antibody. The authors also concluded that administration of gamma globulin to infants should be approached with caution during periods of RSV prevalence. Essentially identical results of a paradoxical response to RSV immunization were also reported by Kim et al. (1969) . In response to three injections of alum precipitated, 100 x concentrated, formalin inactivated RSV vaccine, 437; of infant vaccinees displayed a 4-fold or greater rise in serum neutralizing antibody and 91: : : displayed a 4-fold or greater rise in serum CF antibody. When RSV became prevalent in the community, the rate of RSV infection in infants who received this vaccine was not different from that in control infants who received parainfluenza vaccines. However, a high proportion of RSV vaccinees required hospitalization at the time of RSV infection, whereas only 5% of such infections among parainfluenza vaccinees (control group) resulted in admission to the hospital (see also Table 8 .12). Illnesses among the RSV vaccinees who underwent natural infection included pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis, with pneumonia in a majority and rhinitis, pharyngitis and bronchitis in a few. Thus, infants who received this vaccine were not protected against natural infection and also, when they became naturally infected their illness was more severe than that seen in cohorts who received a similar parainfluenza type 1 vaccine. These findings, similarly to those of Kapikian et al. (1969) , indicated that vaccine-induced RSV serum antibody alone did not protect against illness and suggested that serum antibody (particularly against certain of the viral proteins) without local respiratory antibody might actually play a part in the production of disease.

Such a vaccine would presumably induce local IgA antibody in the respiratory tract and so more closely mimic natural infection with RSV. Initial experiments with a ca virus (Kim et al., 1971) , adapted to 26\u00b0C failed to produce a completely attenuated virus because, for example, a child given the virus developed mild lower respiratory tract disease. The same group used the standard mutagenesis technique with 5-fluorouridine (Wright et al., 1970) to produce a ts mutant designated RS-A2 ts-1. The mutant, after propagation at 30\u00b0C in primary bovine embryo kidney cells did not infect cells at or above 37\u00b0C. In the in vivo hamster model the ts mutant only infected the upper respiratory tract and, moreover, there was no laboratory evidence of phenotypic reversion, which is the most important problem with ts viruses. Initial experiments in adults, who were infected intranasally, indicated that no disease was produced and the vaccinees resisted subsequent challenge with virulent wild type virus (Wright et al., 1971) . The next step was to infect infants and children with virus using a coarse spray. The ts-1 mutant produced infection in 27 of 32 infants as shown by recovery of virus (Table 8 .13) and increases in antibody titre (up to 48-fold) (Table 8 .14). Children excreted vaccine virus for a mean of 6.1 days (Kim et al., 1973) . Another candidate live attenuated RSV vaccine strain, W-2, has been found un- suitable for further work because of over-attenuation (reviewed by . When tested in adult volunteers there was only slight evidence of infection and none of the 14 volunteers shed virus, and only 2 had an antibody response. Similarly, only two of seven seronegative children were infected. In another approach, a live virus vaccine to be administered parenterally has been tested. The vaccine was prepared by passaging a clinical isolate of RSV in W138 cells. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial encompassing 510 children, 233 received the vaccine and 277 received placebo. Children with low levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies did not respond to the vaccine, whereas seronegative children did produce antibodies, but to titres lower than those observed in children after natural infection. RSV infection occurred in the various groups at similar rates. Of the 112 children for which pre-epidemic/post-epidemic serum pairs were available 48.2% (27 of 56) placebo recipients and 50% (28 of 56) of vaccine recipients had serological evidence of RSV infection. Further, 25% (25 of 100) placebo recipients and 17.3% (19 of 98) vaccinees developed RSV illness, as confirmed by viral isolations. Thus, parenterally administered live RSV vaccine did not protect from subsequent RSV infection or illness and this simply repeats the negative results of earlier trials with killed vaccine documented above. Among the 510 study children there were 23 illnesses requiring hospitalization for respiratory tract diseases during the study. Five of the illnesses were caused by RSV infection, as determined by isolation of virus, fourfold increases in antibody titre, or both. Three RSV illnesses were in the vaccine group, and two were in the placebo group. Fortunately, none of the illnesses was particularly severe, and none was life-threatening. N o untoward clinical reactions were noted in most infants (Table 8 .15), although in 7 infants a mild non-febrile rhinitis was noted. However, two worrying features of the ts-1 vaccine strain were spread to non-vaccinees and laboratory evidence of reversion to wild-type phenotype. Thus, of a total of I39 viruses recovered from vaccinees, 34 showed evidence of genetic alteration from the ts phenotype, and 8 viruses completely lost the ts property. Although these revertants represent less than 0.01% of virus produced in the respiratory tract at the time of peak virus replication, they nevertheless made the vaccine unsuitable for more widespread use.

Hinman (1982) has compared and contrasted measles and smallpox as regards several factors which are relevant to worldwide eradication (Table 8 .29). Note that measles shares six of the favourable characteristics with smallpox. Three important differing factors are that smallpox was of lower infectivity than measles and so did not spread so rapidly through susceptible populations. therefore smallpox was sometimes eradicated from areas where overall immunization rates were low. In fact, a containment policy was used whereby once a smallpox case was discovered all contacts in the immediate area were vaccinated (see Chapter 15). In contrast, we know that measles may still be transmitted in communities with immunization levels of > 90%. but on the other hand, it is not clear if measles can persisr indefinitely in these conditions of strong immunity pressure.

MASS MEASLES VACCINATION I N THE USSR Mass vaccination against measles virus was started in the USSR in 1967, although some republics had started as early as -64 (Burgasov et al., 1973 . The attenuated measles virus Leningrad-16 has been used in this campaign (Peradze and Smorodintsev, 1983) . In the years before vaccination, a high morbidity due to measles was noted in the USSR, with an average incidence of 827 cases per 100 000 population. As the scale of vaccination increased a steady decline in morbidity followed and as early as 1969 measles incidence had dropped 4-fold. Serological analysis showed that virus induced immunity persisted for at least 7 years. Thus, of 4793 children's sera analyzed over a period of 7 years at the end of the first year 88.20,/, of children had antibody and in subsequent years only a small proportion of children (2.5-64%) appeared to have lost antibodies. Actual antibody titres remained relatively constant over this period, however. A further point noted was that although no antibodies were detected in the blood of some vaccinated children, nevertheless they were resistant to actual infection. The authors estimated that during the 5 years of vaccination the USSR had saved more than $244 million dollars and the saving in the use of measles gamma globulin alone repaid all the expenses connected with the cost of the vaccine and its administration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 858, "end": 884, "text": "-64 (Burgasov et al., 1973", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 960, "end": 992, "text": "(Peradze and Smorodintsev, 1983)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DURATION OF VACCINE IMMUNITY AND VACCINE FAILURES"}, {"text": "General vaccination with a combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was introduced in Sweden in 1982 (see Christenson et al., 1983) .

Severely malnourished children suffer more complications and are more likely to die than their better-nourished peers.

In India, among children hospitalized with measles 89% of those poorly nourished had more than one complication (e.g., pneumonia, otitis, stomatitis, diarrhoea) while only 20% of the well-nourished had more than one complication (Chen et al., 1980) . Measles in malnourished children differs markedly from the disease as usually seen in the United States and Europe. The rash becomes dark red-purple and exfoliates extensively, exposing large areas of epithelial surface to bacterial invasion. Se-vere changes occur in the mouth, tracheal-bronchial tree, and intestine; extreme soreness of the mouth (stomatitis) prevents the child from eating or drinking; bronchopneumonia, persistent diarrhoea and protein-losing enteropathy then ensue (Axton, 1975) . Xerophthalmia that results in blindness occurs in areas of the world where diets are deficient in vitamin A. In these areas, more than half of the incidence of blindness may be attributable to measles (Walsh, 1983) . Viral excretion persists much longer in poorly nourished patients (12 days, rather than three days as in those well-nourished). The persistence of virus in lymphocytes and intestinal cells suggests that there is a delay in production of lymphocytes that are competent to destroy these cells. As a result, the virus multiplies for a longer period, more cells are infected, and the disease is more severe.

Cell fusion and haemolytic properties of the virus were also inhibited but no effect was noted on virus adsorption. One hundredfold higher concentrations showed inhibition effects on mumps virus, but no anti- + + viral effects were detected against Sendai or RSV. The possible biochemical basis of the antiviral action was not appreciated at the time but re-evaluation of the general approach by Choppin et al. (1983) has highlighted what could be an interesting point of action of antivirals. Choppin et al. (1983) noted the similarity in N-terminal sequences of the F2 polypeptide between paramyxoviruses and many of the short peptides which had been shown earlier to be active virus inhibitors in vitro. Therefore, it was proposed that the fusion activity of F protein might be inhibited by oligopeptides which mimicked this region of the protein. It was found that oligopeptides with the appropriate amino acid sequence were highly effective specific inhibitors of virus infectivity at the level of virus penetration and of virus induced fusion and haemolysis (i.e. activities that reflect the membrane fusing activity of the F protein). Oligopeptides were found which inhibited SV5, Sendai, canine distemper virus as well as measles (Table 8.35) . However, measles virus was much more inhibited than the other viruses. From such studies, several conclusions have been drawn. In general terms it was noted that the oligopeptides with the correct amino acid sequence were specific inhibitors, and the longer the peptide, the more active they were. The most effective peptide tested was a heptapeptide with the sequence of the Sendai virus F, N-terminus and a 50% effective concentration of 0.02 pM. A carbobenzoxy (Z) group on the N-terminal amino acid increased activity as compared to the same oligopeptide with an unblocked N-terminal residue. Other hydrophobic additions also increased inhibitory activity, such as a dansyl (DNS) or a t-butyloxicarbonyl (t-BOC) group. The steric configuration of the N-terminal phenylalanine also significantly affected activity, e.g., Z-D-Phe-L-Gly was more active than Z-L-Phe-L-Phe-Gly and finally esterification of the C-terminal amino acid decreased activity. The effects of the substitutions at the termini of the oligopeptides may be related to the positioning of the inhibitor at the site of action. Thus, the carbobenzoxy or dansyl groups add hydrophobicity to the N-terminus, whereas esterification of the C-terminus decreases the polarity of the peptide, and such changes could affect the orientation of the peptide.

Indeed, attack rates for subsequent parainfluenza illness were rather higher in the vaccinated group than the control groups (Table  8.38 ). An innovative approach to a parainfluenza type Ill vaccine has been to isolate F and HN glycoproteins in their native antigenic forms and to assemble them into a multivalent structure (reviewed by . The virus is disrupted with the non-ionic detergent octylglucoside, the glycoproteins separated by ultracentrifugation and the detergent dialysed off, when the glycoproteins reassemble.

A mild upper respiratory tract infection developed in 17 of the 30 men and no difference in the number developing illness was detected between the two groups. Also no difference in severity or duration of illness or virus isolation rate was detected. Finally, the serum antibody titres were not different in the two groups and the authors concluded that the compound was not active, with the reservation that a large virus challenge dose was used. Nevertheless, the concentrations of drug detected in the nasal wash (approx. 0.3 pg/ml allowing for dilution) would not be high enough to inhibit replication of parainfluenza viruses (based on in vitro data), although they would be high enough to inhibit replication of influenza A viruses.
