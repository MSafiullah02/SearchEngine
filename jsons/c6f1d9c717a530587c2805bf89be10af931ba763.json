[2] [3] [4] Only 120 years ago, it was described by the Englishman Charles Henry Stevens, who praised the root as a new remedy for tuberculosis. 5 Identification of numerous compounds of P. sidoides roots, such as prodelphinidins, methoxycoumarin, and proanthocyanidins, 6 led to the production of an ethanolic extract known as EPs \u00ae 7630 (the active ingredient of the product Umckaloabo \u00ae , ISO-Arzneimittel, Ettlingen, Germany). Today, the liquid herbal drug preparation EPs 7630 from the roots of P. sidoides (1:8-10) , extraction solvent: ethanol 11% (w/w), has been approved for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (aRTI) in several countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Several in vitro studies conducted with EPs 7630 showed an inhibitory effect (growth inhibition) against several bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, especially multi-resistant strains). 9 This effect is brought about by an immune modulation mechanism mediated by the activation of macrophages (with the involvement of cytokine interferon-gamma) and the consequent increase in the production of nitric oxide. 10, 11 The activated macrophages produce, in turn, different cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. 11 P. sidoides also modulates the production of secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, IL-15 in the serum and nasal mucosa, and IL-6 in the serum. 3 Biological and pharmacological properties of EPs 7630 are summarized in Figure 1 .",

[20] [21] [22] aRTI are very common in children, and EPs 7630 was shown to be not only an effective but also a safe treatment for these ailments, also for children of preschool age. 23 Moreover, based on the available data, the European Respiratory Society has acknowledged P. sidoides root extract as a natural remedy available for the treatment of the symptoms of acute bronchitis (AB). 24 In 2013, a review on P. sidoides extract for aRTI was published by the Cochrane Collaboration. 25 Among the placebocontrolled randomized clinical trials that were available for full evaluation, 4 were conducted in children and adolescents. The aim of the current review is to have a closer look at these trials as well as on further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published afterward or not included into the Cochrane review in order to provide a current overview of published clinical trials investigating the efficacy of EPs 7630 in children and adolescents suffering from different manifestations of aRTI.",

Trial participants were included upon presentation of a TSS total score of \u22656 points with complaints lasting no longer than 48 hours at treatment start (day 0). TSS (\"dysphagia\", \"sore throat\", \"salivation\", \"reddening\", \"coating left\", \"coating right\", and \"fever\") were assessed. Local symptoms were assessed by the categories \"severe\" (3), \"moderate\" (2), \"mild\" (1), and \"no symptom\" (0); values for fever were \u226437.5\u00b0C=0; 37.5\u00b0C to <38.5\u00b0C=1; 38.5\u00b0C to <39.5\u00b0C=2; >39.5\u00b0C=3.

The early use of EPs 7630 at the onset of signs of respiratory infection reduces or resolves symptoms more rapidly, reduces the risk of bacterial superinfection, 15 allows more rapid functional recovery, and reduces the use of other drugs such as paracetamol, 19 or, most importantly, antibiotics, 22 to counter the increasingly worrying phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. EPs 7630 is well tolerated and can be used in children from the age of 1 year. Furthermore, its use could provide preventive action against clinical worsening or complications, while reducing the need for NSAIDs and antibiotics.",
