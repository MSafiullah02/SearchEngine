This paper discusses proposed changes to privacy regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act (HIPAA) designed to let health information seamlessly and frictionlessly flow between the health entities that need to collaborate on treatment of patients and, also, allow it to flow to researchers trying to understand how to limit its impacts.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 response imposes unprecedented challenges on our healthcare system. To address these challenges, the health information needed to safely care for a patient needs to flow across provider platforms in a given region without impediment. For example, patients may first be screened by one organization utilizing telehealth, obtain testing at a \"drive-through\" collection site run by a second institution, have tests performed by one of multiple clinical laboratories with novel testing capacity, obtain follow up through primary care or other case management methods at a different institution, and be hospitalized at locations with sufficient capacity, not necessarily related to any prior providers in the information chain. This process is illustrated in Figure 1 . Successful care in this complex, ad hoc system will require safe, secure, and standardized health information exchange, through point-to-point (such as Direct) and hub-and-spoke models (such as a Health Information Exchange (HIE) Organization). However, the current mix of state and HIPAA privacy regulations poses a confusing maze of barriers to effective HIE for patient care. Urgent action is necessary to ensure regulations that are designed to preserve privacy and move toward a more balanced footing that emphasizes continuity of care. In addition, novel approaches to contact tracing using cellular geolocation data and implementation of different types of social distancing strategies, such as workplace and restaurant closures, prohibitions against large public gatherings, and home quarantine, are being applied to manage the pandemic. Research on the effectiveness of controlling the epidemic through advanced contact tracing, social distancing and testing strategies is urgently needed in order to direct policy--but much of this work is limited by current federal requirements for safe harbors regarding anonymization of clinical data. Understanding how specific social distancing strategies work in different micro-geographies may be accelerated by expanding the \"safe harbor\" definition to allow researchers a more detailed geographic view. Normally, this would be a \"limited\" HIPAA data set, which requires both a human subjects expedited review and a HIPAA waiver for research. Loosening the borders of anonymization might allow a broader range of data scientists access to the information without administrative barriers. While such work is possible today, changes to the definition of what protected health information (PHI) is, in the context of this epidemic, could accelerate it. Such changes are possible under the broad powers of the Stafford Act.",

(DHHS) The Privacy Rule provides the guidelines by which the collection, storage, access, and methods of disclosing data, are handled and was intended to be a uniform regulation for the immediate management of PHI as the workforce transitioned from paper files to digitized records. The Security Rule was written to apply only to PHI transmitted electronically, and while legislators soundly anticipated how future data exchange would occur, the law does not work well with today's HIEs. This is largely due to misunderstanding at the organizational level about how the law applies to the broad range of data information that can now be shared via HIE, the complexity of which data requires consent, and what liability exists if healthcare entities misinterpret the law.",

This approach may appear extreme but it holds the most promise for balancing the needs of immediate sharing of information, appropriate protection of PHI, and presenting a clear and definitive statement to healthcare providers and the general public, alike. Specifically, for the duration of the health emergency, the HIPAA standard of no requirement of patient consent to transmit health information on COVID-19 infection status, risk factors, treatments, and recovery status between healthcare providers caring for an individual with suspected, active, or recovering COVID-19 infection, whether point-to-point, or through an HIE Organization, as defined by HIPAA, should be the rule of law for the nation, overriding more restrictive state laws. Requiring patient consent is burdensome and it has been shown that, regardless of method, substantial numbers of patients do not consent.

Such agreements govern how information will be used, stored, and reused by parties that hold information prior to forwarding to another organization and differences vary widely between organizations' legal preferences. A covered entity's BAA with an HIO will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the electronic HIE purpose which the HIO is to manage, the particular functions or services the HIO is to perform for the covered entity, and any other legal obligations an HIO may have with respect to the PHI. Disagreements between organizations on content of BAAs or preferences for their own existing documents are a major barrier to operationalization of HIE between clinical entities. A default safe harbor BAA designed to discourage unnecessary variation, and that specifies how an HIO must protect the information while supporting exchange for clinical care and public health purposes, would accelerate the creation of new partnerships that will create the alternative systems of care shown in Figure 1 .",

Persons coming in close proximity to known COVID-19 patients could be informed by public health, through their devices, self quarantine, obtain testing if symptomatic and contribute to containment. Taiwan successfully applied this approach as part of a Big Data strategy to slow transmission of the virus [7] . The approach is also being tested in Israel [8] . Currently, public health does not have authority to access cellular providers' data for this purpose.

This can be done without undue barriers from Human Subjects review of projects, and security requirements that are inherent in work with a Limited Data Set. To that end, HHS could modify definitions of what an anonymized geoentity is. The current standard is an area of 20,000 people, or the initial three digits of zip code. We would propose to decrease this to 50-100 persons, which would bring the level of resolution to the block level (relevant to home quarantine approaches). In addition, dates of medical services, such as admission, discharge or death dates, will be critical to understanding the outbreak. These should no longer be considered PHI, initial work shows that the risks of infection are age-related; therefore, requirements to aggregate ages into a single category above 90 years should be waived.",
