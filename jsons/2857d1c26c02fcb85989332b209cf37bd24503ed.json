Patterns of virus replication are determined by tight controls on virus gene expression. There are fundamental differences in the control mechanisms of these processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and these differences inevitably affect the viruses that utilize them as hosts. In addition, the relative simplicity and compact size of most virus genomes (compared with those of cells) creates further limits.

Although the contents of eukaryotic cell nuclei appear amorphous in electron micrographs (at least in interphase), they are actually highly ordered. Chromatin interacts with the structural backbone of the nucleus-the nuclear matrix-and these interactions are thought to be important in controlling gene expression. Locally, nucleosome configuration and DNA conformation, particularly the formation of left-handed helical \"Z-DNA,\" are also important. DNAse I digestion of chromatin does not give an even, uniform digestion pattern but reveals a pattern of DNAse hypersensitive sites believed to indicate differences in the function of various regions of the chromatin. It is likely, for example, that retroviruses are more likely to integrate into the host-cell genome at these sites than elsewhere.

Production of a polyprotein encompassing the whole of the virus genetic information, which is subsequently cleaved by proteases to produce precursor and mature polypeptides. These cleavages can be a subtle way of regulating the expression of genetic information. Alternative cleavages result in the production of various proteins with distinct properties from a single precursor (e.g., in picornaviruses and potyviruses) (Figure 5.7) . Certain plant viruses with multipartite genomes utilize a very similar strategy for controlling gene expression, although a separate polyprotein is produced from each of the genome segments. The best-studied example of this is the comoviruses, whose genome organization is very similar to that of the picornaviruses and may represent another member of this \"superfamily\" (Figure 5.7) . 2. Production of subgenomic mRNAs, resulting from two or more rounds of translation of the genome. This strategy is used to achieve temporal separation of what are essentially \"early\" and \"late\" phases of replication, in which nonstructural proteins, including a virus replicase, are produced during the \"early\" phase followed by structural proteins in the \"late\" phase ( Figure 5 .8). The proteins produced in each of these phases may result from proteolytic processing of a polyprotein precursor, although this encompasses only part of the virus genome rather than the entire genome, as above. Proteolytic processing offers further opportunities for regulation of the ratio of different polypeptides produced in each phase of replication (e.g., in togaviruses and tymoviruses). In addition to proteolysis, some viruses employ another strategy to produce alternative polypeptides from a subgenomic mRNA, either by read-through of a \"leaky\" translation stop codon (e.g., tobamoviruses such as TMV; see Figure 3 .12), or by deliberate ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site (see \"Posttranscriptional Control of Expression\"). All the viruses in this class have evolved mechanisms that allow them to regulate their gene expression in terms of both the ratios of different virusencoded proteins and the stage of the replication cycle when they are produced. Compared with the two classes of DNA virus genomes described above, these mechanisms operate largely independently of those of the host cell.

As with all (\u00c0)sense RNA viruses, packaging of this virus-specific transcriptase/replicase within the virus nucleocapsid is essential because no host cell contains any enzyme capable of decoding and copying the RNA genome.

In this sense, SV40 provides a eukaryotic parallel with the bacteriophage \u03bb genome. In vitro systems exist for both transcription and replication of the SV40 genome, and it is believed that all the virus and cellular DNA-binding proteins involved in both of these processes are known. The SV40 genome encodes two T-antigens (\"tumor antigens\") known as large T-antigen and small T-antigen after the sizes of the proteins (Figure 5.12) . Replication of the double-stranded DNA genome of SV40 occurs in the nucleus of the host cell. Transcription of the genome is carried out by hostcell RNA polymerase II, and large T-antigen plays a vital role in regulating transcription of the virus genome.

As the concentration of large T-antigen builds up in the nucleus, transcription of the early genes is repressed by direct binding of the protein to the origin region of the virus genome, preventing transcription from the early promoter and causing the switch to the late phase of infection. Large T-antigen is also required for replication of the genome, and this is discussed further in Chapter 7. After DNA replication has occurred, transcription of the late genes occurs from the late promoter and results in the synthesis of the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.

Integrated DNA proviruses are formed by reverse transcription of the RNA retrovirus genome, as described in Chapter 3. The presence of numerous binding sites for cellular transcription factors in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of these viruses have been analyzed by \"DNAse I footprinting\" and \"gel-shift\" assays ( Figure 5.14) . Together, the \"distal\" elements (such as NF-\u03baB and SP1-binding sites) and \"proximal\" elements (such as the TATA box) make up a transcription promoter in the U3 region of the LTR (Chapter 3). However, the basal activity of this promoter on its own is relatively weak, and results in only limited transcription of the provirus genome by RNA polymerase II. Both HTLV and HIV encode proteins that are trans-acting positive regulators of transcription: the Tax protein of HTLV and the HIV Tat protein (Figure 5 .15). These proteins act to increase transcription from the virus LTR by a factor of at least 50\u00c0100 times that of the basal rate from the \"unaided\" promoter. Unlike T-antigen and the early promoter of SV40, neither the Tax nor the Tat proteins (which have no structural similarity to one another) bind directly to its respective LTR. Instead, these proteins function indirectly by interacting with cellular transcription factors which in turn bind to the promoter region of the virus LTR. So the HTLV Tax and HIV Tat proteins are positive regulators of the basal promoter in the provirus LTR and are under the control of the virus, as synthesis of these proteins is dependent on the promoters which they themselves activate ( Figure 5 .16). On its own, this would be an unsustainable system because it would result in unregulated positive feedback, which might be acceptable in a lytic replication cycle but would not be appropriate for a retrovirus integrated into the genome of the host cell.

This section describes only a few well-researched, specific examples of posttranscriptional regulation. Many DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus encode mRNAs that must be spliced by cellular mechanisms to remove intervening sequences (introns) before being translated. This type of modification applies only to viruses that replicate in the nucleus (and not, e.g., to poxviruses) as it requires the processing of mRNAs by nuclear apparatus before they are transported into the cytoplasm for translation. However, several virus families have taken advantage of this capacity of their host cells to compress more genetic information into their genomes. A good example of such a reliance on splicing are the parvoviruses, transcription of which results in multiple spliced, polyadenylated transcripts in the cytoplasm of infected cells, enabling them to produce multiple proteins from their 5 kb genomes ( Figure 5.5) , and, similarly, polyomaviruses such as SV40 ( Figure 5 .12).

Several \"families\" of adenovirus genes are expressed via differential splicing of precursor hnRNA transcripts. This is particularly true for the early genes that encode transacting regulatory proteins expressed immediately after infection. The first proteins to be expressed, E1A and E1B, are encoded by a transcriptional unit on the r-strand at the extreme left-hand end of the adenovirus genome ( Figure 5 .17). These proteins are primarily transcriptional trans-regulatory proteins comparable to the Tax and Tat proteins described above but are also involved in transformation of adenovirus-infected cells (Chapter 6). Five polyadenylated, spliced mRNAs are produced (13S, 12S, 11S, 10S, and 9S) which encode five related E1A polypeptides (containing 289, 243, 217, 171 , and 55 amino acids, respectively) ( Figure 5 .18). All of these proteins are translated from the same reading frame and have the same amino and carboxy termini. The differences between them are a consequence of differential splicing of the E1A transcriptional unit and result in major differences in their functions. The 289 and 243 amino acid peptides are transcriptional activators. Although these proteins activate transcription from all the early adenovirus promoters, it has been discovered that they also seem to be \"promiscuous,\" activating most RNA polymerase II-responsive promoters that contain a TATA box. There are no obvious common sequences present in all of these promoters, and there is no evidence that the E1A proteins bind directly to DNA. E1A proteins from different adenovirus serotypes contain three conserved domains: CR1, CR2, and CR3. The E1A proteins interact with many other cellular proteins, primarily through binding to the three conserved domains. By binding to components of the basal transcription machinery-activating proteins that bind to upstream promoter and enhancer sequences and regulatory proteins that control the activity of DNAbinding factors-E1A can both activate and repress transcription. proteins. The transcription of the E1A itself is a balanced, self-regulating system. The IE genes of DNA viruses typically have strong enhancer elements upstream of their promoters. This is because in a newly infected cell there are no virus proteins present and the enhancer is required to \"kick-start\" expression of the virus genome. The IE proteins synthesized are transcriptional activators that turn on expression of other virus genes, and E1A functions in exactly this way.

The way in which these two RNAs act is not completely understood, but their net effect is to boost the synthesis of adenovirus late proteins. The VA RNAs are processed by the host cell to form virus-encoded miRNAs. These operate through RNA interference (see Chapter 6) to downregulate a large number of cellular genes involved in RNA binding, splicing, and translation. In addition, virus infection of cells stimulates the production of interferons (Chapter 6). One of the actions of interferons is to activate a cellular protein kinase known as PKR that inhibits the initiation of translation. VA RNA I binds to this kinase, preventing its activity and relieving inhibition on translation. The effects of interferons on the cell are generalized (discussed in Chapter 6) and result in inhibition of the translation of both cellular and virus mRNAs.

Most ribosomes encountering this sequence will translate it without difficulty and continue on along the transcript until a translation stop codon is reached. However, a proportion of the ribosomes that attempt to translate this sequence will slip back by one nucleotide before continuing to translate the message, but now in a different (i.e., \u00c01) reading frame. Because of this, the UUUAAAC sequence has been termed the \"slippery sequence,\" and the result of this frameshifting is the translation of a polyprotein containing alternative information from a different reading frame. This mechanism also allows the virus to control the ratios of the proteins produced. Because only a proportion of ribosomes undergoes frameshifting at each slippery sequence, there is a gradient of translation from the reading frames at the 5 0 end of the mRNA to those at the 3 0 end. The slippery sequence alone results in only a low frequency of frameshifting, which appears to be inadequate to produce the amount of protease and reverse transcriptase protein required by the virus. So there are additional sequences that further regulate this system and increase the frequency of frameshift events. A short distance downstream of the slippery sequence is an inverted repeat that allows the formation of a stem\u00c0loop structure in the mRNA (Figure 5.21) . A little further on is an additional sequence complementary to the nucleotides in the loop that allows base-pairing between these two regions of the RNA. The net result of this combination of sequences is the formation of what is known as an RNA pseudoknot. This secondary structure in the mRNA causes ribosomes translating the message to pause at the position of the slippery sequence upstream, and this slowing or pausing of the ribosome during translation increases the frequency at which frameshifting occurs, thus boosting the relative amounts of the proteins encoded by the downstream reading frames.

This is a mechanism similar in many respects to frameshifting that permits multiple polypeptides to be expressed from individual reading frames in a single mRNA. In some retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), the pro gene is separated from the gag gene by a UAG termination codon rather than a slippery sequence and pseudoknot (Figure 5.20) . In the majority of cases, translation of MLV mRNA terminates at this sequence, giving rise to the Gag proteins. However in a few instances, the UAG stop codon is suppressed and translation continues, producing a Gag\u00c0Pro\u00c0Pol polyprotein, which subsequently cleaves itself to produce the mature proteins. The overall effect of this system is much the same as ribosomal frameshifting, with the relative ratios of Gag and Pro/Pol proteins being controlled by the frequency with which ribosomes traverse or terminate at the UAG stop codon.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 424, "text": "(Figure 5.20)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BOX 5.4 VIRUSES-MAKING MORE FROM LESS"}, {"text": "Control of gene expression is a vital element of virus replication.
