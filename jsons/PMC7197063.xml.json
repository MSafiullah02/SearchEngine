We make certain operational definitions to allow us to analyze evolution coherently across all evolutionary eras. For example, if we encounter more than 10 genes in a gap on one genome between two adjacent gene pairs, we break up the synteny block into two at that point. This is justified by the regular decrease in frequency in gap sizes from 0, 1, 2, until there are almost none of size 8, 9, or 10, except between neighbouring synteny blocks, which can be separated by large numbers of unpaired genes in either of both of the genomes. We want to study the nature of the distribution of gap size due to fractionation or gene deletion, and this avoids biasing estimates by inclusion of gaps produced by mechanisms other than fractionation. Thus, we use the default parameters of SynMap, except for the maximum number of non-duplicate genes interrupting any neighbouring gene pairs, which we set at 10.\n",
