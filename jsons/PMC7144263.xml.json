COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 displays symptoms ranging from mild to severe (pneumonia) that can lead to death in some individuals [2\u20134]. As of March 24, 2020, there have been 422 566 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 18 887 deaths [5]. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) as the cellular entry receptor [6]. While the virus can infect individuals of any age, to date, most of the severe cases have been described in those over the age of 55 years and with significant co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7]. Here, we determined whether patients with COPD have increased expression of ACE-2 in bronchial epithelial cells in lower respiratory tract.",

There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE-2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=\u22120.24; p=0.035; fig. 1b). Interestingly, smoking status was also significantly related to ACE-2 gene expression levels in airways of these participants with current smokers having a significantly higher gene expression than never smokers (current smokers=2.77\u00b10.91 versus never smokers=1.78\u00b10.39; p=0.024). Former smokers had gene expression levels in-between that of never and current smokers (former smokers=2.00\u00b11.23; fig. 1c).

Here, we investigated gene expression levels of ACE-2 in the airways of individuals with and without COPD and found that COPD and current smokers had significantly increased expression of ACE-2. Importantly, gene expression levels of ACE-2 were inversely related to individual's FEV1, suggesting a dose-dependent response. These findings were observed in 3 different cohorts, indicating their generalizability and robustness.",

In contrast to ACE, which converts angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II, ACE-2 breaks down angiotensin II to its metabolites including angiotensin-(1\u20139) and angiotensin-(1\u20137), which are potent vasodilators, and thus may be a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system [16]. ACE-2 is expressed in a variety of different tissues including both the upper and lower respiratory tract, myocardium and the gastrointestinal mucosa [17]. Although its role in human health and disease has not been fully elucidated, it appears to have an important regulatory role in blood pressure and cardiac function. The physiologic role of ACE-2 in the airways is largely unknown. However, in mice, ACE-2 has been shown to protect animals from severe lung injury related to aspiration and sepsis [18].",

These results are also consistent with previous observations in small animals wherein smoke exposure has been shown to upregulate both the expression and activity of ACE-2 in the airways [19, 20]. While the up-regulation of ACE-2 may be useful in protecting the host against acute lung injury, chronically, this may predispose individuals to increased risk of coronavirus infections, which uses this receptor to gain entrance into epithelial cells. This may in part explain the increased risk of viral respiratory tract infection in active smokers and virus-related exacerbations in those with COPD.",

Third, although the airway epithelia is the major source of entry for COVID-19, the virus can gain host entry through other ports including gastrointestinal mucosa, which was not evaluated in this study.
