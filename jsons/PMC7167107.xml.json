            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifaceted inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It involves a gradual destruction of myelin due to an autoimmune response generated against self\u2010antigens in a genetically vulnerable patient (Donati & Jacobson, 2002). The attack against self\u2010antigen leads to a gradual demise of neurons, resulting in severe neurological deficits (Goldenberg, 2012). The myelin sheath is an insulating cover of axons maintained by oligodendrocytes (Compston & Coles, 2008), and facilitates electrical action potentials between neurons. Loss of oligodendrocytes and degeneration of the myelin sheath leads to the formation of plaques or lesions, commonly located in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord white matter (Popescu & Lucchinetti, 2012). While the repair process of remyelination is possible early in disease, oligodendrocytes are incapable of complete repair due to subsequent attacks to the sheath, contributing to the plaque formation (Chari, 2007; Kuhlmann et al., 2008). Damage or death of neurons due to lesion accumulation causes astrogliosis adding to lesion creation (Compston & Coles, 2008) diminishing the communication between neurons and leading to a wide range of disorders, largely dependent on the location of the lesions, in the brain (Virtanen & Jacobson, 2012). Symptoms include loss of sensitivity, changes in sensation (tingling, or pins and needles), muscle weakness and spasms, blurred vision, ataxia, and speech disorders (Compston & Coles, 2008). MS affects people of almost all ages, although higher incidences are detected in younger adults as they are more susceptible to environmental factors. MS is more common in women, suggesting that hormones may also play a significant role in determining susceptibility (Milo & Kahana, 2010; Nylander & Hafler, 2012). Prevalence of MS is two to three times higher in women than in men (Figure 1) (Ahlgren, Oden, & Lycke, 2012; Compston & Coles, 2002; Orton et al., 2010; Wallin et al., 2012).",

            "text": "During the initial stages of the disease, patients primarily experience a neurological complication referred to as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). This is the first demyelinating event, lasting for approximately 24 hr and presenting as monofocal or multifocal lesions in the CNS (Marcus & Waubant, 2013). Possible symptoms of CIS include optic neuritis, a brain stem/cerebellar syndrome, a spinal cord syndrome, or hemispheric dysfunction (Miller, Barkhof, Montalban, Thompson, & Filippi, 2005). Later, the disease becomes more convoluted and characterized as progressing into four distinct variants. These subtypes are important for patient prognosis and treatment considerations. The most common type of MS is called Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS) and occurs in approximately 87% of MS cases (Ransohoff, Hafler, & Lucchinetti, 2015). RRMS patients show neurological symptoms and have a short and temporary relapse phase where not only existing symptoms are aggravated, but new symptoms may also arise (Weiner, 2008). The inflammatory attacks during this period are unpredictable and are associated with visual and memory impairment, tingling and numbness and fatigue. This relapse stage is followed by a stage of remission (complete/incomplete) in which the patient may recover (fully or partially), resulting in asymptomatic disease for several months or years (Ghasemi, Razavi, & Nikzad, 2017). Another variant is Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) occurring in ~65% of patients with RRMS, gradually transitioning into SPMS as neurological complications steadily advance over time. Patients may have intermittent relapses, but no remission is observed (Correale, Gaitan, Ysrraelit, & Fiol, 2017; Ghasemi et al., 2017). A more uncommon variant, Primary Progressive MS (PPMS), occurs in approximately 10%\u201315% of MS cases (Ransohoff et al., 2015). PPMS is distinguished by a gradual progression from onset with deteriorating symptoms and no occurring relapses or remissions. These patients are primarily affected at the nerves of the spinal cord and present with fewer brain lesions compared to other subtypes. Patients with PPMS show ataxia with problems in walking, weakness, stiffness, and trouble with balance (Ghasemi et al., 2017). Lastly, Progressive\u2010Relapsing MS, another rare subtype (occurring in ~5% of MS cases) is marked by complications starting from the initial stages of the disease, and progresses with critical relapsing cases without any remissions, mostly without recovery resulting in exacerbating neurological injuries. Symptoms in these patients include eye pain, double vision and depression, along with sexual, intestinal, and urinary system dysfunctions (Ghasemi et al., 2017).",

PMS is pathophysiologically distinct in terms of brain biopsy, cellular profiling in CSF, and the immune molecules present when compared with adult MS patients (Schreiner, 2018). The psychological consequences of childhood MS include depression, fatigue, anxiety, panic disorder, bipolar disorders, and cognitive impairment (Amato et al., 2010). Though the disability rate is lower than that of adult\u2010onset MS, children diagnosed with PMS pose a risk of developing neurological deficits during the active stage of life (Renoux et al., 2007).",

Exposure to specific cytokines, such as IL\u20101, IL\u20102, IL\u20104, IL\u20106, TNF, and INF\u2010\u03b3 result in the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ cells into a variety of subsets: Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Tfh, and Treg. Each subset possesses a unique cytokine profile, releasing cytokines specific to that subset, which may provide protective or anti\u2010/pro\u2010inflammatory properties (Golubovskaya & Wu, 2016). Th1 provides protection against intracellular pathogens, Th2 defending against parasites, and Th17 focuses on defending the host against extracellular pathogens. For example: exposure to IL\u20101 results in the differentiation of a na\u00efve CD4+ cell to a Th17 subset which function as mediators of inflammation and produce IL\u201017, protecting the host against fungi and bacteria (Golubovskaya & Wu, 2016; Raphael, Nalawade, Eagar, & Forsthuber, 2015). Th17 cells are known to mediate autoimmunity and play key roles in augmenting inflammation (Raphael et al., 2015).",

However, there are various subsets of these CD8+ effector cells: A na\u00efve (CD45RA+/CCR7+) subset lacking effector functions, (a) an antigen\u2010experienced and differentiated (CD45RA+/CCR7\u2212) subset providing effector functions (TEff), (b) an antigen\u2010experienced (CD45RA\u2212/CCR7+) subset lacking effector functions, known as central memory cells (TCM), and (c) an effector function bearing (CD45RA\u2212/CCR7\u2212) memory cell subset, defined as effector memory cells (TEM) (Saxena, Martin\u2010Blondel, Mars, & Liblau, 2011). Proliferation and antigen\u2010driven activation of these effector C8+ cells is mediated by Th1 produced IL\u20102, and may present as autoreactive T cells as a result of self\u2010antigen presentation by APCs, potentially resulting in T\u2010cell induced axonal damage (Hwang, Hong, & Glimcher, 2005; Rollings, Sinclair, Brady, Cantrell, & Ross, 2018; Saxena et al., 2011). Expansion of CD8+ cells, detection of identical antigen\u2010specificity in a population of T cell clones, and presence of predominantly IL\u201017 producing CD8+ cells, all within active lesions in MS, support the concept of CD8+ cell mediated autoimmunity, in MS (Saxena et al., 2011).",

            "text": "An atypical response by immune cells against the myelin sheath is the common pathological factor between all MS subtypes. This response is facilitated by discriminatory activation of CD4+ helper and CD8+ killer T cells, accompanied by little to no activation of regulatory T cells (Gandhi, Laroni, & Weiner, 2010). As a result, inflammation is an alternate characteristic symptom of MS. T lymphocytes and activated macrophages infiltrate the brain and with the aid of activated microglia, induce immunological activation, leading to progressive myelin destruction (Kasper & Shoemaker, 2010). Disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) also allows immune cells to enter the brain, where T lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath (Compston & Coles, 2002). This triggers a subsequent inflammatory cascade, leading to the secretion of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)\u201017, and the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes which can secrete their own cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)\u2010\u03b2 (Duddy et al., 2007). These soluble factors cause further recruitment of immune cells, perpetuating inflammation and damage (Nylander & Hafler, 2012). In addition, pro\u2010inflammatory Type 1 T helper (Th1) and Th17 cells display direct cytotoxic effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cells and obstruct remyelination (Baxi et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015).",

Although MS is not a hereditary disease, predisposition to genetic variations increases the risk. Studies have shown that the risk rate in monozygotic\u2010twins that have 100% genetic familiarity is approximately 25% (Ghasemi et al., 2017). These risks are reduced on decreased genetic familiarity, with 5% in siblings, 2% in parents, 2% in children, and 1% amongst distant relatives (Hassan\u2010Smith & Douglas, 2011).",

            "text": "Discovered in mice in 1936, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the human equivalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are extensively studied for both gene and allelic variation in MS (Matzaraki, Kumar, Wijmenga, & Zhernakova, 2017). HLA changes are responsible for approximately 20%\u201360% of genetic predisposition (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011), and around 110 polymorphisms found in discrete loci outside the MHC gene are associated with the susceptibility to MS (Sawcer, Franklin, & Ban, 2014). According to a Genome\u2010wide association study, susceptibility to MS has been linked mainly to the HLA\u2010DRB1 locus class II region of the MHC, with the HLA\u2010DR15 (DRB1*1501\u2010DQA1*0102\u2010DQB1*0602\u2010DRB5*0101) haplotypes dominating MS risk in Caucasians and HLA\u2010DRB1*15:01 associated with MS risk in African Americans and northern Han Chinese populations (Compston & Coles, 2008). Additional alleles within the MHC locus have been associated to MS including the HLA\u2010DRB1*03:01, HLA\u2010DRB1*13:03, HLA\u2010DPB1*03:01 and HLA\u2010A*02:01, while HLA\u2010C554 and HLA\u2010DRB1*11 are believed to be protective against the disease (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011). Polymorphisms in non\u2010HLA genes associated to MS include the interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor alpha (IL2RA) and interleukin 7 (IL7) receptor alpha (IL7RA) loci expressed on regulatory T cells, important for proliferation and survival of T\u2010 and B cells, and increase the vulnerability of developing MS (Giovannoni & Ebers, 2007). Single\u2010Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL\u20107R markers identified in MS patients in Sweden suggest that SNPs can lead to dysregulation in the activity of both T\u2010 and B\u2010cells (Lundmark et al., 2007). By analyzing MS patients possessing SNPs in the Serine\u2010Threonine Kinase 11 gene (encoding liver kinase B1\u2014LKB1), Boullerne et. al. suggests it as a risk factor for MS (Boullerne et al., 2015). LKB1 has effects on T\u2010cell activation, Th1/Th17 cytokine production, and modulate adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Dysregulation of LKB1 function is implicated toward MS pathogenesis (Germain et al., 2013). It has been demonstrated using GSAW that multiple non\u2010MHC loci\u2014CLEC16A, IL2RA and IL7R are susceptibility loci for MS (De Jager et al., 2009). Other non\u2010MHC critical factors with links to MS include TNFRSF1A (Caminero, Comabella, & Montalban, 2011; Hoffjan et al., 2015), which contains two independent susceptible alleles responsible for dysregulated expression of TNF; IRF8 has a susceptible allele that encodes transcription factors, and CD6 is involved in T\u2010cell co\u2010stimulation and differentiation (De Jager et al., 2009).",

Environmental factors such as smoking, vitamin deficiency, diet, and UV radiation exposure act as modifiable risk factors (Sawcer et al., 2014). The expression of the Vitamin D receptor on most immune cells including APC is considered a driving force in MS progression (Disanto, Morahan, Barnett, Giovannoni, & Ramagopalan, 2012). Presence of 1,25\u2010dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1\u03b1,25\u2010(OH)2D3) modulates the expression of MHC II\u2010complexed antigens on the surface of immune cells, inhibits the production of Type 2 helper T cell cytokines, and affects T\u2010and B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (Aranow, 2011; van Etten & Mathieu, 2005). The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) reported that the genes encoding the Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) enzyme for vitamin D production and Cytochrome P450 Family 24 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP24A1) enzyme which degrades 1,25\u2010dihydroxyvitamin D contribute to MS progression by lowering the levels of active vitamin D. Moreover, RNA expression levels of the MS susceptibility gene, HLA\u2010DRB1*15:01 are controlled by vitamin D levels (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011).",

Furthermore, tobacco affects the integrity of the BBB and triggers inflammatory responses that, lead to loss of membrane integrity (Hawkes, 2007; Hernan et al., 2005; Riise, Nortvedt, & Ascherio, 2003).

Virus\u2010derived peptide sequences such as the Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) (Owens, Gilden, Burgoon, Yu, & Bennett, 2011)and BRRF2 protein contribute to MS pathology partly by activation of memory B cells, increased frequency of oligoclonal IgG specificities, and by interacting with HLA through DR2b (DRB1*1501) and DR2a (DRB5*0101) (Abdelrahman, Selim, Hashish, & Sultan, 2014; Pender & Burrows, 2014). The production of EBV\u2010specific T cells or antibodies cross\u2010react with autoantigens in the CNS, and attack myelin sheath.

It is also possible that individuals without early life exposure to infectious pathogens could mount abnormal responses during infectious exposure in their adult life (Baranzini et al., 2010).

The clinical manifestation is relatively mild presenting as skin rashes, though, in rare cases, neurological complications can also occur. Acute disseminated encephalitis (Lundmark et al., 2007), measles inclusion body encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis are all severe cases of measles which have been associated with CNS disorders (Laksono et al., 2016). In MS patients, the most frequent anti\u2010viral antibodies produced intra\u2010thecally tend to be against measles, rubella and VZV, referred to as MRZ reaction phenomenon. Although this is not restricted to a direct association with these three viruses, it may be a response against different viruses such as HSV or EBV. Evidence supporting the possible direct interaction or causal association of measles with MS is not well documented; moreover, unchanged prevalence of MS after vaccination against measles, shed further doubt on the possible association between the virus and disease (Ahlgren, Od\u00e9n, Tor\u00e9n, & Andersen, 2009; Donati & Jacobson, 2002; Jacobson, Flerlage, & McFarland, 1985; Norrby, Link, & Olsson, 1974).",

The two variants HHV\u20106A and HHV\u20106B have about 90% sequence homology, and are transmitted via saliva and close contact with infected parents during early years of life. HHV\u20106B is the causative agent of exanthema subitum (or roseola), a benign febrile illness with skin rashes while HHV\u20106A has not been definitively associated with any disease (Reynaud, Horvat, & Horvat, 2013). HHV\u20106 is able to enter cells through the CD46 receptor, with viral antigen able to be detected in oligodendrocytes and rarely in astrocytes. However, HHV\u20106 has been detected in the scar\u2010like plaques on the myelin sheath of MS patients (Reynaud et al., 2013). Accordingly, IgM antibody against the P41/38 antigen and DNA of HHV\u20106A was reported in serum from RRMS patients. HHV\u20106A persists and may reactivate CNS immune cells, leading to higher lymphoproliferative response against HHV6A which has been detected in MS patients. Mechanistically, HHV\u20106 may be linked to pathogenesis of MS through a proline\u2010rich integral membrane protein known as U24 (Sullivan & Coscoy, 2010). The proline rich region of U24 possesses sequence identity with MBP at a key phosphorylation site which, if molecular mimicry were to occur, the mitogen\u2010associated kinase pathway and the glycogen synthase kinase may be recruited and activated, resulting in lower phosphorylation of MBP. The potential of the proline\u2010rich region of U24 acting as a molecular mimic may mediate cross\u2010reactivity of T\u2010cells and lead to targeting of MBP in MS patients.",

Later onset of symptomatic EBV infection is extremely risky (Ascherio & Munger, 2007). CD4 and CD8 T cells are the primary line of defense against EBV\u2010infection. The association of EBV with MS is supported by numerous case reports where EBV infection was shown to cause axonal demyelination, and detectable EBV antibodies were reported in CSF and meningeal lymphoid follicles (Salvetti, Giovannoni, & Aloisi, 2009; Thacker, Mirzaei, & Ascherio, 2006; Tselis, 2012). The major EBV antigen in MS cases is EBNA1, with antibodies produced specifically in the CSF compartment forming oligoclonal bands, a characteristic of viral infection in MS. Epitope mapping techniques employed for testing the specificity of oligoclonal IgG showed that MS\u2010specific epitopes are derived from EBNA1 and BRRF2 (EBV lytic gene product) proteins, providing evidence of intrathecal production of EBNA1\u2010specific IgG in MS (Cepok et al., 2005). Viral capsid antigen (VCA) and the early antigens (EA) are also produced against EBV. Serum antibodies to VCA show more variation and higher seroprevalence than antibodies to EBNA\u20101. EBV transforms B cells controlled by host immunological control leading to EBV\u2010associated malignancies. During the lytic stage, C\u2010terminus of EBNA1 binds to the episome (circular DNA of EBV) and transmits virus into progenies. Another link between EBV infection and MS corresponds to molecular mimicry for immunodominant myelin resultant motifs on T cells (Libbey & Fujinami, 2010). Peptides derived from EBV have sequences which are stimulatory for MBP derived CD4 T\u2010cell clones. A cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell clone detects the MBP peptide similar to the HLA\u2010DR2b and EBV BSLF1 peptide similar to the HLA\u2010DR2a. T cells specific to EBNA1 will provide immunity against EBV, but in MS patients, an EBNA1\u2010specific response of T cells is distorted; yielding exacerbated T cell responses throughout infection. Molecular mimicry amongst viral antigens and autoantigens support autoreactive T cells, such as the accumulation of EBNA1\u2010targeting T cells leading to autoimmunity associated with infection. EBV genes in turn excite autoimmune B cells which are also cross\u2010reactive, serving as evidence that EBV has involvement in MS pathogenesis (Compston & Coles, 2008) (Figure 2).",

Transport of the VZV within T\u2010cells and subsequent fusion with neurons has been postulated as a possible infectious mechanism (Horien & Grose, 2012). Despite this, the risk of developing MS upon VZV infection is less when compared to infection with EBV or HHV\u20106 (Virtanen & Jacobson, 2012).",

Additionally, C. pneumoniae was isolated from 64% of MS patients, showing coincidental infection (Sriram et al., 1999). C. pneumoniae has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and schizophrenia given that the pathogen can invade the blood stream, and when taken up by monocytes as carriers, can cross the BBB and access the CNS (Cahoon, 2009). It must be recognized that the direct relation of C. pneumoniae with MS is controversial.

As multiple species of bacteria and virus have been shown to associate with MS, it is possible that the mechanism of this association is a result of generalized inflammation caused by the immune response to these pathogens. The listed pathogens have been reported to cause one or more of the indicated pathways which culminate in the demyelination of neurons and progression of MS. The outlined therapeutic strategies include the existing treatment options as well as the focuses of current research",
