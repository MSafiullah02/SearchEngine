Its members are classified taxonomically into 12 genera and have a wide host range, from mammals, birds, fish, and insects to reptiles and plants. The virus particles are non-enveloped and icosahedral, with a diameter of 60-80 nm [13] . Within the family Reoviridae, members of the genus Orthoreovirus were originally divided into fusogenic and nonfusogenic groups based on their ability to cause cell fusion and syncytia [7] , but they are now classified into five species based on their host range: Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), Avian orthoreovirus (ARV), Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV), Baboon orthoreovirus (BRV) and Reptilian orthoreovirus (RRV), with MRV being non-fusogenic and the other four fusogenic. The dsRNA genomes of orthoreoviruses contain approximately 23,500 base pairs in 10 segments divided into three size classes based on their mobility in SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE): three large (L1, L2 and L3), three medium (M1, M2 and M3) and four small segments (S1, S2, S3 and S4) [3] .",

In 2006, a second bat reovirus, Pulau virus (PulV), was reported, isolated from fruit bats during a search between 1998 and 1999 for Nipah virus in this species on Tioman Island, Malaysia. It was then characterized as a new member of the NBV species, since it was serologically and genetically closely related to NBV [14] . In 2007 and 2008, two new members of the NBV species, Melaka virus (MelV) and Kampar virus (KamV) were discovered in Malaysia [5, 6] . Although MelV and KamV were not directly isolated from bats, their close relationship to NBV and PulV and preliminary epidemiological data suggested that both are most likely bat-associated orthoreoviruses.",

This discovery has given rise to increasing concern about bat-transmitted reovirus infections in humans. Recently, another fusogenic reovirus was isolated in Hong Kong from an ill tourist who had a history of travel in Bali, Indonesia, and who might have acquired the infection from an unknown animal vector in Bali [4] . This virus (strain HK23629/07) has a high sequence identity with current bat reoviruses, suggesting not only its membership in the NBV species but also the possibility of its being bat-borne.",

Supernatants were inoculated onto conventional monolayer cultures of Vero-E6 cells in MEM supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 .

The result showed that S1 was highly variable, while S3 was highly conserved among the five reoviruses. Similarities of XRV with NBV, PulV, MelV and KamV ranged from 54.8-65.4% for S1 and 87.3-96.2% for S3. XRV had the highest S1 identity with NBV and the highest S3 identity with MelV. The S1 sequences of XRV and NBV were the same length, while those of the other three viruses were 12-17 bp shorter. Alignment of S1 sequences revealed a deletion of a 15-bp sequence in PulV, MelV and KamV from nt 559 to 573, and the presence of an identical 24-bp sequence (nt 1571-1594) in all five reoviruses (see Fig. 3a ). Phylogenetic analysis using S1 and S3 sequences placed XRV among the NBV rather than the other orthoreovirus species (Fig. 3b, c) .",

The lung tissues from this study were later used to investigate the possibility of their carrying other viruses, which is how XRV was isolated and identified. Following its isolation in Vero-E6 cells, XRV was tested for its syncytium-forming ability in other cell lines available in our laboratory, since viruses of the NBV species can induce extensive syncytial CPE in mammalian cell lines. The results showed that XRV could also induce fusogenic CPE in Vero, BHK-21, PK-15 and MDCK cell lines, with CPE developing more rapidly than during the primary passage (data not shown). The bat origin and syncytial CPE, along with the morphology and genomic pattern, are highly [14] . L, M and S represent large, medium and small segments, respectively. The arrows indicate co-migration of two segment bands consistent with the characteristics of the NBV species, but the definitive classification has to be based on nucleotide sequencing. Currently, only S segments of bat reoviruses have been sequenced and used for this purpose [4] [5] [6] 14] , and the sequences of their L and M segments have not been determined. Therefore, SPAT was used to clone XRV S segments, and only S1 and S3 sequences were obtained and then used for phylogenetic analysis, which clearly characterized XRV as a new bat reovirus and a potential sixth member of the NBV species.",

Although the natural hosts of MelV, KamV and HK23629/07 have not been identified, fruit bats are the likely host species. In addition, the discovery of XRV has significantly expanded the geographical distribution of bat reoviruses northward (Fig. 1) .

Since then, two more bat reoviruses have been isolated from human cases with acute respiratory disease [4, 6] . These findings have challenged the concept that bat reoviruses are not human pathogens. Given that bats are very important reservoir animals for a number of zoonotic viruses and play a significant role in the transmission of emerging zoonotic diseases to humans [16] , the pathogenicity of XRV merits further study. The increasing number of viruses isolated in bats further highlights the urgent need for a systematic survey of the ecology of bat-borne viruses in their natural habitats in proximity to human communities. This will enable effective risk assessments of viral spillover in order to permit development of better strategies for control and to prevent potential outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.
