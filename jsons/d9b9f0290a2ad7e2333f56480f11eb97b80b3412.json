The interaction of integrins with their ligands or their expression in different tissues and cells may be considered as potential therapeutic targets. These class of therapeutic agents has already been developed for the treatment of oncologic and chronic inflammatory diseases making possible treatments readily available if proven effective. Of additional interest is the use of molecules able to interfere with cytokines production, 9 as these biomolecules are responsible for the modulation of integrin expression. 10-15",

Integrins were also found to be overexpressed on the surface of several inflamed tissues. 4 Besides the fibronectin binding motif RGD, other integrinbinding sites are specifically expressed in SARS-COV-2, and, particularly, a change from a LDV to a LDI motif is likely significant. The LDV/LDI switch in human immunodeficiency virus infection has been shown to play a key role in strain diffusion, contributing to high viral infectivity. 5 We investigated the protein sequence of the human coronavirus and compared it to SARS and bat coronavirus to identify any eventual overexpression of other integrin-binding sites.",

This type of virus-integrin binding is shown to facilitate adhesion, cytoskeleton rearrangement, integrin activation, and increased intracellular signaling. The tripeptide LDI is also present in the spike are a family of cell surface receptors, formed through a noncovalent association of two type I transmembrane glycoproteins, the 18-\u03b1 and 8-\u03b2 subunits, which combine to form at least 24 different heterodimers to mediate the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix as well to other cells. Integrins are widely expressed and every nucleated cell in the body owns a specific integrin signature. Of note, the regulation of integrins is dynamic and quickly changes once cells are taken out of their normal environment. Integrins interaction with their extracellular ligands is tunable by microenvironment signals, such as chemokines and growth factors. It has been demonstrated that this kind of interaction is strictly correlated to the progression of many diseases such as tumors and chronic inflammatory disorders.",
