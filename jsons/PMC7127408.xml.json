            "text": "Recent efforts in the design of molecular biology tools have focused on the RNA interference (RNAi) effect to knock down the expression of a target protein [1]. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA), which are small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) oligonucleotides with or without overhangs, are substrates for the RNA-induced silencing complex [2]. When transfected into cells, synthetic siRNAs strongly inhibit the expression of a target protein in mammalian cells. The application of siRNA to human therapy has attracted much attention, although the delivery of siRNA to the appropriate cells, tissues, or organs remains a major challenge. An ideal gene delivering carrier should safely transport genetic materials without any toxic effects or inducing immune responses [3]. Most research has used viral vectors, retroviruses, and adenoviruses, or liposomes [4]. Recently, many non-viral vectors have been reported that were modified with fusogenic peptides [5], cationic lipids [6], cationic polymers [7], [8], [9], and others. However, some cationic compounds show cytotoxicity effects.",

In particular, biodegradable nanospheres are available for delivering drugs and are degraded after passing a required specific site [11]. Among these, poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) have been approved by the FDA for certain human clinical uses. The degradation time of PLGA can be altered from days to years by varying the molecular weight, the lactic acid to glycolic acid ratio in the copolymer, or the nanospheres\u2019 structure. PLGA nanospheres have been suggested to be a good gene delivery carrier because of their safety and their properties of sustained release [12], [13]. We have developed an emulsion solvent diffusion (ESD) method in water for preparing PLGA NS [14]. The advantages of this ESD method are that NS can be prepared by a simple process under mild conditions without sonication. A PLGA NS platform to encapsulate a wide variety of nucleic acids (e.g., plasmid DNA, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA) for gene delivery was established using the ESD method [15].",

CS-modified PLGA NS could be prepared by adding a CS solution into the outer phase with a PVA solution. The CS-modified PLGA NS had a positive charge due to protonation of the amino group. The zeta potential shifted to positive values due to the effect of CS adsorbed on the surface of PLGA NS. The particle size of CS-modified PLGA NS increased because the molecular layers of CS modified the surface of PLGA NS. We have also checked the composition of CS-modified PLGA NS using FITC-conjugated CS. CS adsorbed on NS surface was 8% (w/w) in the NS (data not shown). After modifying with CS, the encapsulation efficiency was increased. The effect of modifying with CS on the loading efficiency might be caused by an ionic interaction between siRNA and CS and prevented leakage of siRNA from emulsion droplets during the diffusion process.
