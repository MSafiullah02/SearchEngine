However, the geographical reach and speed of spread of reports in current social media and present numerous ways to disseminate 'alternative facts' have new global implications for the consequences of unreliable 'news' [3] .",

            "text": "Concerns in the health sector include social media posts making spurious health claims for 'alternative medicines' and containing misinformation about causes, severity and treatments of disease -from coronaviruses [4] and HIV infection [5] to cancers [6] . A striking example of the serious impact on the public of misinformation is a sustained large increase in vaccine hesitancy for measles and other immunisations since the late 1990s [7] . This arose from a later withdrawn report in the Lancet of a link between autism and immunisations against measles, mumps and rubella [8] . Although findings in the paper were judged to be fraudulent, anti-vaccine activists persist in providing misleading information on social media based on this report. Particularly worrying is how difficult it continues to be for international public health authorities to counter this vaccine hesitancy [7] . Immunisation rates against these potentially serious infections remain sub-optimal [7] 22 years after the original flawed report [8] . Social media undoubtedly plays a role here, and its potency is reflected in the fact that just one source is enough to disseminate and propagate untruths [9] . However, this very potency also represents a means to inform and educate patients, members of the public, health professionals and policymakers. The FPM International Awards for Medical Writing in Social Media are new annual awards for medical or other health professional graduates from anywhere in the world. To be eligible, an article or blog must be in English and should have been published online between 1st August 2019 and the closing date for the awards: 31st July 2020. There will be up to 5 prizes per year. Each award winner will receive a \u00a3100 prize. Award winners will also have winning content published in one of the FPM's journals, either Health Policy and Technology or the Postgraduate Medical Journal .",
