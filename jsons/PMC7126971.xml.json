By June 11, 2009, there were almost 30,000 confirmed cases reported in 74 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an influenza pandemic [12]. WHO and the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus be used as a monovalent vaccine during the 2009 pandemic as well as for the 2010\u20132011 flu season [13]. Results reported at a WHO meeting in 2010 indicated the pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 vaccines elicited potentially protective antibody responses in a high proportion of older children and adults within 2 weeks of administration of a single dose of vaccine [14]. Efficacy studies of H1N1 2009 inactivated vaccines have confirmed these vaccines are protective and that hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) seroprotection predicts prevention of influenza infection and illness. For example, a study in China of over 95,000 children and adults immunized with a split-virion A (H1N1) 2009 vaccine was 87.3% effective in preventing confirmed influenza infection in school-age children [15].",

Mexico did not obtain a licensed vaccine to start its own vaccination program until November 27, 2010, which was at the end of the second pandemic wave and after most of the 72,000 confirmed cases and 1300 deaths had occurred [16]. The August 2010 report by the US President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reviewed the US response and concluded that a vaccine made by recombinant DNA technology using genetic sequences should be a priority for development as the technology could potentially reduce the time required to supply vaccine should another influenza pandemic occur [1].

Concentrated VLPs were then separated from host contaminants, baculoviruses, and nucleic acids using ion exchange chromatography. After concentration by ultrafiltration and inactivation of residual baculovirus with 0.2% beta propiolactone, final purification was accomplished in the following steps: gel filtration chromatography, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, diafiltration in PBS, and 0.22 \u03bcm filtration. The sterile purified H1N1 2009 VLPs were stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C and were considered stable when stored at this temperature for at least 1 year.",

Over the course of the study where subjects were potentially exposed to the H1N1 virus, a slight increase in HAI GMTs in the placebo group was observed (HAI GMT of 20 at baseline compared to 24 and 25, at Day 14 and Day 36), but these changes were not statistically significant (95% CI responses overlapped). HAI responses in all VLP groups were significantly higher than placebo at all post baseline time points. A dose-dependent rise in Day 14 HAI responses was evident in comparisons between the 5 \u03bcg and 15 \u03bcg or 45 \u03bcg VLP vaccine groups, but the increase in HAI GMT between the 45 \u03bcg VLP group and the 15 \u03bcg VLP group was not statistically significant (Table 3\n). The second immunization showed no effect on HAI titers in the 5 \u03bcg and 15 \u03bcg VLP vaccine groups and resulted in only a slight increase in the 45 \u03bcg VLP group. Similarly, the HAI GMR indicated a dose\u2013response relationship, with a 4.0, 6.6, and 8.7 mean increase at Day 14 in the 5 \u03bcg, 15 \u03bcg and 45 \u03bcg vaccine groups (respectively), and no additional increase (relative to the Day 14 result) at Day 36 (2 weeks after the second injection) except in the 45 \u03bcg VLP group (HAI GMR: 10.0).",

Thus, an exploratory analysis was performed on subjects who had no measurable HAI titers (i.e., HAI titer <1:10) at baseline (seronegative). Day 14 HAI seroprotection and seroconversion rates, which were identical in seronegative subjects, were 64%, 79% and 85% for the 5 \u03bcg, 15 \u03bcg and 45 \u03bcg vaccine dose groups, respectively. Unlike seropositive subjects, seronegative subjects had a trend towards higher GMTs at all dosage levels and following both vaccinations, suggesting that the seronegative population as a whole was primed with the first vaccine dose and boosted by the second (Table 3). The high rates of seroconversion and seroprotection achieved in the seronegative population after one injection further suggest that the VLP vaccine was highly immunogenic. The microneutralization assay, which demonstrated higher GMTs overall in the subset of subjects evaluated, essentially confirmed HAI findings, although the dose\u2013response differences were not significant (Table 4\n).",

Comparable safety and immunogenicity results in adults administered a single injection have been published for this strain with inactivated subvirion vaccines [19], [20]. The current study population had a relatively high rate of preexisting immunity (HAI titer \u226540 rate: 36\u201341%) for a novel pandemic strain. Baseline H1N1 pandemic strain seroprotection rates of 30\u201333% was reported in the Australian population [19]. Consistent with other studies, we found no measurable cross reactivity with other pandemic strains in our study (data not shown) suggesting strain specific immunity. As the sera sampling occurred at the end of the second wave in Mexico, the data suggests that this novel H1N1 pandemic strain exposure established a relatively high rate of subjects with high HAI titers in the general population in a short period of time. The strain specificity provided an opportunity to evaluate the VLP vaccine immunogenicity in a relatively na\u00efve population. A sub-analysis was performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine in the seronegative population (no measurable HAI titers to H1N1 at baseline), as an indicator of the VLP vaccine's immunogenicity. As shown in Table 3, responses in this population were robust as indicated by a 79% seroprotection rate achieved after a single 15 \u03bcg dose.",

Adjuvanted vaccines achieved up to 100% vaccine efficacy in children [29], but were accompanied by high rates of fever and local side effects.

The data presented in this study indicate that the vaccine is highly immunogenic, even in the seronegative population, and was well-tolerated in a large and placebo-controlled study. The expectation by public health authorities that a transmissible, highly pathogenic pandemic virus will emerge remains a threat, and delivery of effective and rapidly available vaccines continue to be an important development priority.
