Its pulmonary component is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases [1].",

            "text": "Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) refers to mechanical ventilation delivered through a noninvasive interface, such as a face mask, nasal mask, or nasal prongs; it is more comfortable allowing expectoration, eating, speech and prevents rebreathing than full face mask. The face mask is generally preferred over a nasal mask or nasal prongs during the initiation of NIV for several reasons. Most patients with acute respiratory failure are mouth breathers; therefore, NIV delivered by a nasal mask results in a large air leak through the mouth and a worse outcome. The nasal air passages offer significant resistance to airflow, which can mitigate the beneficial effects of NIPPV if a low level of positive airway pressure is used. There are two principal forms used: Pressure support ventilation (PSV) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). PSV is the most common mode chosen by clinicians who want to maximize patient comfort and synchrony. Both provide positive airway pressure during the respiratory cycle, but BiPAP offers pressure in a biphasic manner, with higher pressures during inspiration than expiration. Studies in patients with obstructive lung disease indicate that low-level CPAP offsets the detrimental effects of auto-positive end-expiratory pressure, which are caused by gas trapped in alveoli at end expiration and decreases inspiratory work of breathing. The addition of inspiratory pressure support to CPAP (or BiPAP) generally improves tidal volume in proportion to the amount of pressure applied .Both CPAP and BiPAP have been used as an alternative to intubation in patients with a variety of respiratory conditions, including congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and COPD, avoiding the complications associated with endotracheal intubation. It improves numerous clinical outcomes and is the preferred method of ventilatory support in many patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD complicated by hypercapnic acidosis [5], [6].",

Respiratory mechanics measured after the initiation of NIPPV demonstrate a decreased respiratory rate, an increased tidal volume, and increased minute ventilation. In addition, the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) tends to increase as the PaCO2 decreases. The pressure support level should be increased until patient\u2019s respiratory rate is below 30 breaths per min because this respiratory rate indicates that the inspiratory effort has been reduced to a reasonable level. However, the expiratory effort of patients with COPD may increase when the pressure support is increased, which makes selection of the optimal pressure support level difficult [7].",

Few complications developed during FOB procedure. Desaturation of arterial blood (SaO2 less than 88%) displayed on the monitor occurred in 4/25 patients (16%) but it was not clinically significant to prevent the completion of the procedure and it was temporary for few minutes and easily manageable through temporary increase in PS or IPAP on NIPPV and enhancing the procedure. Another complication was encountered in the form of increased heart rate more than 120 beats /minute which occur in only 2/25 cases (8%) and it was mostly related to the light sedation as it disappeared with the administration of extra doses of sedative drugs. However, no significant side effects as vomiting, cardiovascular events, pneumothorax and bronchospasm happened during the procedure. The lack of major complications is consistent with previous reports, which clearly demonstrated the feasibility and safety of FBO plus BAL performed under the assistance of NIPPV in patients with severe hypoxemic and hypercapnic ARF who should have to be otherwise intubated to allow such invasive procedures [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. This was also in agreement with a feasibility study done by Hans J\u00f6rg Baumann et al. [22] to assess the safety of FOB in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring NIPPV, the average duration of bronchoscopy was 7.8 \u00b1 5.5 min (range 3.5\u201337.0 min). In all cases bronchoscopy was completed without subsequent complications. Two patients developed transient SaO2 values below 90% during the procedure, the minimum SaO2 was 84% (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6\n).",

This analysis was greatly helpful to reach an accurate diagnosis and started a targeted antibiotic strategy guided by the culture and sensitivity results, while in group II, there was a real problem to get a good sputum sample from the lower airway not contaminated from the oral flora. Bacteriological study of the BAL obtained in group I of the study revealed no growth in 14/25 cases (56%) while 11/25 cases (44%) had positive findings. Staphylococcus auerus in 3 cases, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was found in 3 cases while candida was found in 2 cases. E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella were found only once in 3 different patients.

This finding might be explained as a high proportion of patients in the present study were initially admitted to the hospital in the medical wards and shifted to critical care areas after developing decompensated respiratory failure and they might have got gram negative hospital acquired infections during their stay in addition to the preceding intake of oral antibiotic before admission which may alter classical pattern of microorganisms.",

Most of them failed due to accumulation of secretions with subsequent deterioration of the ABG findings and depressed consciousness level. Comparing this failure rate (36%) with another study also done by Raffaele Scala et al. [23] in 2005 on 80 patients with acute respiratory failure, NIPPV failed in 23 of 80 patients (28.8%) which is near to our study. In another study done by Carlucci A et al. [24] studying Noninvasive versus Conventional Mechanical Ventilation, 43 patients out of 108 patients (40% of all NIV patients) eventually required endotracheal intubation while in group I of the present study, the failure rate on NIPPV is significantly less than group II as only 2 patients failed out of 25 patients (8%). In Scala et al.\u2019s [16] study which is the only study done to assess the effect of early FBO during NIPPV, the technique failed in 3 of 15 patients (20%). The discrepancy between the ratios in the two studies cannot be explained due to the small number of patients which make any statistical analysis or correlation unreliable. Besides the etiology of decompensation in scala study was community acquired pneumonia while in my study was different factors which were less medically serious than pneumonia. The total duration of NIV in succeeded cases in group I (23 patients) ranged between 15.0 and 48.0 h with a mean value of 28.52 \u00b1 10.63 while in group II (16 patients), it ranged from 24.0 to 96.0 h with a mean value of 56.25 \u00b1 21.34 with a significant statistical value between both groups (p 0.001) denoting the possible beneficial effect of FOB in facilitation of faster weaning after removing the secretions and improvement of blood gases.

This is explained by the faster improvement in patients of group I and less incidence of intubation and mechanical ventilation which definitely lead to the prolongation of ICU stay in group II .Comparing the length of ICU stay in group II where we apply NIPPV without FOB with another similar matching group of NIPPV in Carlucci A et al. [24] study, a high degree of similarity exists as the length of stay in the present study was ranging from 4.0 to 35.0 days with a mean value of 8.68 \u00b1 7.18 days while it was 8. 6 \u00b1 6.3 days in the NIPPV group in the other study.",

Comparing the mortality in group I to the mortality in Scala et al.\u2019s [16] study, where 3 out of 15 patients (20%) died, it was found that it is much less in our study. This can be attributed to the etiology of decompensation in scala study was community acquired pneumonia while in my study was different factors less in severity. However, the interpretation of data in this limited number of patients is unreliable. The mortality in group II (12%) came in agreement with most of the studies applied on NIPPV for hypercapnic respiratory failure, as an example the mortality in Carlucci A et al. [24] study was 10% (5 out of 50 patients). Minor change in this percentage of mortality between different studies can be understood in the light of different levels of care and experience in different centers as well as different baseline characteristics of the studied groups of patients.",

However, the selection of patients -managed by NIPPV in whom application of FBO will be beneficial remains a clinical decision to be done by the treating physician based on the overall clinical condition of the patient and his initial response to treatment on NIPPV and also the available resources and the skills of the physician in the provision of FOB with minimal risk of complications. With the application of more randomized clinical trials on the role of bronchoscopy in the setting of AHRF, a clear consensus and precise guidelines might develop in the future emphasizing its application as a standard of care during NIPPV.",

The control group in Scala et al.\u2019s [16] study was patients on invasive ventilation. We totally agree that this study was very important and a pioneer but we are claiming that our study design and objectives are more reasonable and the results we reached in our pilot study can be considered a preliminary cornerstone and starting point for further investigations in the same topic through a multicenter study to provide adequate sample size in a reasonable duration.",
