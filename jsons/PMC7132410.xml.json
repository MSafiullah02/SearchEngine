The most recent outbreak was identified on November 27, 2007, and involved 51 cases in western Uganda [1] (Table 1\n). To date, more than 1000 human deaths have been linked to the Ebola virus [1]. Recent Ebola outbreaks have been a study in infection control and medical practice during disasters where health infrastructures were overwhelmed, information was limited and supplies were scarce. Even though most Ebola outbreaks have occurred in third-world countries, there are many practical lessons that can be applied if a hemorrhagic fever outbreak should occur in the United States. As the recent New Orleans/Katrina experience and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto highlight, even first-world hospital systems can be overwhelmed by disasters and be forced to perform with inadequate information, supplies, medical staff and social support. The Kikwit Ebola outbreak of 1995 was one of the most well studied infectious epidemics and one of the first times that the Ebola virus was treated in a hospital setting. The lessons learned from this outbreak are still applicable to this day.",

The presenting indicator of an expanding infectious disease was a high number of cases of \u201cbloody diarrhea\u201d resulting in death [7]. Early in the epidemic, bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella or Salmonella was thought to be the pathogen responsible for the outbreak [2], [7], [8].",

Currently, Ebola is listed as a Category A pathogen by the National Institutes of Health due to its high mortality rate and weaponization potential [11], [18], [19], [20], [21].

The world community was asked for help 2 days later by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [6], [8]. On May 8, the Congolese authorities decided to close the other surrounding health facilities near Kikwit in an attempt to prevent the spread of the infection and the subsequent destruction of the remaining health care infrastructure [8]. A definitive diagnosis of Ebola was not made until May 9 or 10 (depending on the literature cited) [2], [7], [8]. Between May 10 and May 19, nine international medical teams, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Doctors Without Borders and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), arrived, bringing supplies and knowledge [5], [8]. The arriving teams helped to augment the understaffed hospital, provided barrier supplies and disinfectant, improved the quality of the isolation unit's effectiveness, assisted in developing safer burial procedures and improved the triage system for sick patients. The secondary health facilities were not reopened until May 20 and even then they only dealt with medical and surgical emergencies [8].",

Symptoms seen in terminal patients included obtundation, anuria, shock, hiccups, tachypnea and a period of fever, which would resolve to normothermia 2 days before death [24]. It was noted that disease transmission only occurred during symptomatic periods and not during latency or convalescence [10], [12], [14], [15], [16]. The latency period (time from exposure to time of becoming symptomatic) ranged from 2 days to 3 weeks [24].

The algorithm was based on readily identifiable symptoms and did not rely on labs. Fortunately, the emergency department could be separated into two areas, one of which functioned as an observation area. Patients were observed for up to 24 h to see if they met algorithm criteria for admission to the isolation unit. If it appeared that a patient would eventually meet criteria, the decision was made to move them to the isolation area sooner rather than later. Oftentimes, the decision to transfer a patient to the inpatient isolation ward would be based on the risk of the patient potentially infecting others, particularly if they were symptomatic with diarrhea and/or vomiting [6]. The presence of the algorithm helped reduce the psychological stress on staff since it made the decision of whether to admit or not less of a personal call [23].",

When presenting to the hospital, 9% downplayed their symptoms and exposure risk to medical personnel [2]. During the time period when it was certain that they were infected with Ebola, all reported experiencing fear. Fifty-six percent were fearful of pain and suffering, 53% were fearful of dying a horrible death, 41% were fearful of separation from relatives and 23% feared being abandoned by relatives. In terms of support and optimism, 50% reported believing that they had a chance to recover and 85% reported receiving support from medical staff, 70% from family and 24% from other patients. All patients identified a belief in God or a spiritual connection as being important. The most discouraging experience for patients who survived was witnessing the death of friends and/or colleagues who were with them on the isolation unit [2].",

Similar stressors were reported among health care staff in Asia and Canada during the SARS epidemic [21], [23], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. In the Congo, it was common for staff to develop psychosomatic symptoms similar to those seen in Ebola patients. Symptoms of headache, fatigue, muscle pains and perceived fever were most common [13]. For the most part, the staff did very well during the initial phase of the crisis because they were busy and did not have time to ruminate about or fully assess their situation [13]. Once the epidemic became more \u201croutine,\u201d staff began to develop more emotional and psychological problems. Many of the staff felt underappreciated during and after the crisis and did not feel that their sacrifices were recognized. The nursing staff felt that they were at the greatest risk due to close patient contact [10]. The staff who stayed during the crisis had a strong sense of duty and were heavily vested in their professional role as a coping mechanism.",

As seen in the Kikwit outbreak, it took 4 months before it was clear that an outbreak was occurring and to identify the infectious agent. This would be a more dramatic problem if the epidemic resulted from a biological weapon attack utilizing multiple agents simultaneously, making it difficult for treating physicians to recognize one disease's symptoms and isolate the pathogens responsible [20], [40]. Even with known diseases such as Ebola, where there was some basic science information available, there were still several important unknowns that needed to be answered. (What strain of agent is involved? Has the virus mutated? Is the data accurate and applicable to this situation?) In the recent SARS outbreaks, there were disagreements between hospital administrators and nurses over what level of isolation precautions were necessary to protect staff [22], [23], [41]. If an infectious outbreak such as Ebola, SARS or avian flu occurs, and if supplies are available, it is best to assume that most infectious transmission routes and provide protection until proven otherwise. This sends a message to the staff that their interests, safety and concerns (e.g., fear of infecting their own family) are being addressed and that the institution recognizes the risks they are taking and is trying to protect them, as well as their patients. This outbreak did demonstrate that with the proper supplies and precautions, the risk to staff can be significantly reduced even when there are unknowns.",

As the Kikwit Ebola outbreak demonstrated, during massive viral epidemics, surge capacity is decreased, not increased [21], [23]. Instead of being able to render aid (e.g., personnel or bed space), surrounding hospitals were actually shut down by the government in order to prevent the spread of the infection. The ability of outside staff being used to help augment existing staff shortages rarely occurs during a true emergency since other facilities do not want to share staff and distant staff wish to avoid exposure and the risk of death. Also, a viral outbreak (i.e., avian flu) could potentially go on for months to years, making the long-term use of outside personnel impractical [21], [23]. Hospitals need to have plans in place that define how they will function for a prolonged period of time with at least a 40\u201350% reduction in staff [23]. Whatever plans are enacted, there needs to be provision for handling routine medical emergencies such as heart attacks, surgical emergencies and pregnancies [21]. These plans also need to make provisions that assume that other facilities will have closed and that their institution is the only functional hospital for their region. As was seen in Kikwit and with Hurricane Katrina, it took approximately 1\u20132 weeks for outside help to arrive and be functionally implemented [21].",

It is often the nursing staff who feels the greatest level of stress due to their constant contact with sick patients, who may not be improving despite the nursing staff's best efforts [23]. Physicians usually cope somewhat better with this situation because they are in a position to make treatment decisions and are less directly involved in implementing patient care [23]. It is important for administrators and doctors to be receptive to suggestions from nursing staff and support personnel. Input is empowerment and provides a sense that these critical staff retain some control over their situation. If suggestions are not acted on, clear explanations as to why they were not should be provided and alternatives should be explored. Administration needs to be supportive of staff and not be seen as pedantic and overly controlling. In cases where staff and support personnel did not feel appreciated or listened to, there was a high degree of dissatisfaction and an increased occurrence of absenteeism and staff strikes, which further reduced personnel in an already-strained system [22], [23].",

It is important for medical personnel to see these reactions for what they are: misguided but self-protective behaviors, manifestations of the illness (e.g., delirium) and the patient's fear of being sick. If medical staff do not appreciate the source of these behaviors, they may question their role, become hostile and experience a loss of professional identity and a breakdown of their own protective denial. (Why should some individuals place themselves at risk when they are being viewed as the enemy?) Due to this potential antagonistic relationship and the possible delirium that can be caused by the infection, doctors and support staff need to be ready to deal with agitated patients both mentally and physically.
