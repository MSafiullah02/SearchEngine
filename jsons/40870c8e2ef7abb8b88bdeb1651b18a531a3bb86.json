We aimed to characterize the cytokine profile in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) taken from infants during upper respiratory tract infection to investigate whether RSV induced a unique immune response as compared with other viruses. Additionally, we sought to determine whether this profile was influenced by the infants' atopic status. A prospective birth cohort of babies at high risk of atopy was recruited. Ratios of a T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-g ) and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-like cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), in NPAs were determined during episodes of respiratory tract infections in the first year. The viral aetiology of the respiratory tract infections was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and immunofluorescence. Atopic status was ascertained at 1 year of age using skin prick tests. Participants were recruited antenatally and subsequently followed in the community. Sixty babies with one or both parents atopic were enrolled into the study. IFN-g : IL-10 ratios in NPAs during upper respiratory tract infections and their correlation with viral aetiology and atopic status were the main outcome measures. The mean IFN-g : IL-10 ratio was significantly lower (due to lower IFN-g ) during RSV infections than during infections with other viruses ( P = 0\u00b7035). The cytokine ratio, however, did not differ between infants with or without wheeze during URTIs ( P = 0\u00b744), or between infants who were atopic or non-atopic ( P = 0\u00b749). This study suggests that RSV is associated with lower IFN-g production in young babies, regardless of their atopic status, compared to upper respiratory tract infections where either another virus is detected or where no viral identification is made.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There is evidence that frequent infections early in life protect against the development of atopy [1] [2] [3] [4] . It is not clear, however, which infections are protective and whether some infections may in fact promote the development of atopy. The Th1/Th2 paradigm is central to hypotheses about the relationship between infections and the development of atopy. Th1 (CD4 + ) cells that primarily produce IFN-g and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are involved in cell mediated immunity and inhibit B cell isotype switching to IgE production. Th2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), which promotes IgE production, interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is an important eosinophil growth factor, and IL-10, which is at least functionally a Th2 type cytokine because it inhibits IFN-g production [5, 6] . In theory, multiple infections early in life may enhance the development of Th1 type cells, thus protecting against further Th2 differentiation and possibly atopy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 101, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 774, "end": 777, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 778, "end": 780, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The role of respiratory viral infections in the development of atopy and asthma presents an enigma, in that many studies have shown an increased incidence of wheeze and other respiratory symptoms after severe RSV infections in childhood when compared with controls who were not hospitalized for RSV [7] [8] [9] .
