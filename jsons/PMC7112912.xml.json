            "text": "In late 2002, an outbreak of unusual life-threatening respiratory disease of unknown etiology began in Guangdong Province, China. This disease was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was later determined by Drosten et al. (2003), Ksiazek et al. (2003), and Rota et al. (2003), to be caused by a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV. Since the identification of coronavirus as the infectious agent for SARS, numerous laboratories have begun research on this virus. According to the WHO, 8098 people were diagnosed with SARS and 774 people died of this disease during the initial outbreak of 2003. Due to the severity of SARS disease and the contagious nature of the causal agent, the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/) has provided guidelines for working safely with this coronavirus. The WHO recommends biosafety level 3 (BSL3) as the appropriate containment level for working with live SARS-CoV, and there is a concern that another SARS outbreak could occur following an accidental exposure in a laboratory. Since the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003, there have been three known cases of SARS in laboratory researchers due to accidental exposure to the virus (Normile, 2004). Successful inactivation of the virus allows the transfer of material from a BSL3 to a BSL2 environment and may reduce the risk of accidental infections through unsafe laboratory practices. Inactivated cell-culture derived viral stocks may also be useful for the development of vaccines and the study of their safety and immunogenicity. We examined the efficiency of several methods of viral inactivation, including methods that may inhibit viral replication or entry.",

UVC is absorbed by RNA and DNA bases, and can cause the photochemical fusion of two adjacent pyrimidines into covalently linked dimers, which then become non-pairing bases (Perdiz et al., 2000). UVB can cause the induction of pyrimidine dimers, but 20\u2013100-fold less efficiently than UVC (Perdiz et al., 2000). UVA is weakly absorbed by DNA and RNA, and is much less effective than UVC and UVB in inducing pyrimidine dimers, but may cause additional genetic damage through the production of reactive oxygen species, which cause oxidization of bases and strand breaks (Tyrrell et al., 2001).",

To test the ability of heat to inactivate the SARS-CoV, we incubated virus in 1.5 ml polypropylene cryotubes at three temperatures (56, 65 and 75 \u00b0C) for increasing periods of time. We found that at 56 \u00b0C most of the virus was inactivated after 20 min (Fig. 2A). However, the virus remained infectious at a level close to the limit of detection for the assay, for at least 60 min, suggesting that some virus particles were stable at 56 \u00b0C (Fig. 2A and C). At 65 \u00b0C, most of the virus was inactivated if incubated for longer than 4 min (Fig. 2B). Again, some infectious virus could still be detected close to the limit of detection for the assay, after 20 min at 65 \u00b0C. While virus was incompletely inactivated at 56 and 65 \u00b0C even at 60 min, it was completely inactivated at 75 \u00b0C in 45 min (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, at both 56 and 65  \u00b0C the virus was inactivated at early time points but at 60 min a small amount of virus was detected. One possible explanation for this result may be the presence and subsequent dissociation of aggregates. Taken together, these results suggest that viral inactivation by pasteurization may be very effective.",

Other attempts at using formalin inactivation for generation of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (Kim et al., 1969) and measles virus (Fulginiti et al., 1967) were not useful, as they induced an aberrant immune response resulting from formalin-induced perturbations of the viruses. Formalin inactivation occurs when nonprotonated amino groups of amino acids, such as lysine, combine with formaldehyde to form hydroxymethylamine. The hydroxymethylamine combines with the amino, amide, guanidyl, phenolic, or imidazole group of amino acids to create inter- or intramolecular methylene crosslinks (for review, see Jiang and Schwendeman, 2000). Fraenkel-Conrat (1954) observed the absorption spectra of several plant viruses and determined that formalin also binds in a reversible manner to RNA, blocking reading of the genome by RNA polymerase. Glutaraldehyde can also be used to inactivate virus and is used as a disinfecting agent of medical instruments, such as endoscopes (Tandon, 2000), and as a fixative for electron microscopy (McDonnell and Russell, 1999).",

At 25 and 37 \u00b0C, formalin inactivated most of the virus, close to the limit of detection of the assay, after 1 day, yet some virus still remained infectious on day 3. However, glutaraldehyde completely inactivated the virus by day 2 at 25 \u00b0C and by day 1 at 37 \u00b0C.

These data suggest that different pH conditions affect the spike proteins of coronaviruses, and the activity of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV may be sensitive to changes in pH, possibly by changing the infectious nature of the viral particles. Therefore, we investigated the effect of different pH exposures on the infectivity of SARS-CoV. After exposing SARS-CoV to extreme alkaline conditions of pH 12 and 14 for 1 h, and subsequently reversing the conditions to a neutralized, buffered solution, the virus was completely inactivated (Fig. 3\n). Moderate variations of pH conditions from 5 to 9 had little effect on virus titer, regardless of the temperature. However, highly acidic pH conditions of 1 and 3 completely inactivated the virus at 25 and 37 \u00b0C. At 4 \u00b0C, a pH of 3 did not fully inactivate the virus.

We determined that exposure of SARS-CoV to extreme basic or acidic conditions caused inactivation, while the virus remained stable within a range of neutral pH. The pH of gastric secretions of the stomach ranges from 1.0 to 3.5, while the small and large intestines range from pH 7.5 to 8.0 (Guyton and Hall, 1997). Taken together, these data suggest that ingestion of SARS-CoV would probably result in inactivation of most virions by stomach acid. However, acidic conditions of the stomach may be partially neutralized by a particularly large meal or antacid ingestion, and under these conditions the virus might have a chance to move through the stomach into the slightly basic conditions of the intestines. Leung et al. (2003) have shown enteric involvement of the SARS virus, as evidenced by the presence of active viral replication in intestinal biopsy specimens from five patients, and the isolation of SARS-CoV RNA in stool specimens up to 10 weeks after onset of symptoms. These data, coupled with the previously mentioned stability of the virus to moderate pH conditions, suggest that the SARS virus may survive ingestion and a fecal/oral route of infection may be possible.",
