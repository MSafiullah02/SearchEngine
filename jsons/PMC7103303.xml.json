The ON was used to form an RNA\u2013DNA duplex that sterically blocked the RNA, resulting in inhibition of gene expression and consequently of viral replication [1]. Later it was found that a second inhibitory mechanism operates in cells. Recognition of the RNA:DNA duplex by the cellular enzyme RNase H results in subsequent RNA cleavage, and hence prevents gene expression. This second mechanism of action became the one primarily pursued and known generally as \u201cantisense\u201d. This led to the industrial development of therapeutic DNA-based ON and their analogues for control of gene expression, but sadly so far to little clinical success [2], [3].",

One important advantage of the steric block approach of modulating gene expression is its greater specificity, and thus potentially lower off-target effects, compared to conventional antisense, since binding of an ON to a partially matched, inappropriate RNA sequence is unlikely to have biological consequences. A second advantage is the ability to use a considerably wider range of synthetic ON analogues than is possible with conventional antisense, since there is no requirement for molecular recognition by cellular RNase H. Instead, the only key initial necessities for a suitable steric block ON are tight binding to the RNA target as well as good resistance to nuclease degradation. The greater flexibility to manipulate ON chemistry makes it easier also to focus on other essential requirements for therapeutic development, such as good delivery to cells and tissues, low toxicity, and other pharmacological parameters.",

PS linkages improve cellular uptake, metabolic stability and pharmacology, but also give rise to reduced RNA binding. Several other types of negatively charged, phosphate-containing analogues have better binding to RNA and higher resistance to nuclease degradation, for example 2'-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) (with or without PS linkages) [5] and N3'\u2013P5'-phosphoramidates (NP) [13].

An alternating LNA/DNA 16-mer containing all PS linkages was found to give efficient splice switching in mice [17].

Although departing significantly from the sugar-phosphate backbone found in regular DNA, oligomers of both types retain very strong and sequence-specific RNA binding characteristics [22], [23]. For example, PNAs targeting the 5'-UTR of luciferase mRNA were shown to inhibit translation of protein synthesis [24]. PMOs also have been found to be remarkable steric block ONs for inhibiting translation [25], altering pre-mRNA [26] and blocking miRNA activity [27], as demonstrated in embryos, cells and animals. Now PMOs have been taken to pre-clinical studies for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, viral diseases and genetic disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (see Section 5).",

For example, many methods of PNA delivery have been devised, such as electroporation, microinjection, transfection in complex with a DNA ON, lipofection of acridine or other polyheteroaromate functionalized PNA, and photochemically-induced delivery. Cell transfection efficiencies are highly variable and sensitive to small variations in conditions and the type of transfection method used, with the best achievable IC50 values usually around 200 nM in a model splice redirection system [28]. The relatively high molar levels of these oligomers required to obtain significant steric block action, compared to ON with an RNase H-dependent mechanism of action or short interfering RNA (siRNA), are probably due to the need to deliver at least a stoichiometric amount of the ON to the RNA target into the right cell compartment to obtain the desired biological effect.",

Later, conjugates of an antisense ON with a peptide derived from helix 3 of the Antennapaedia homeodomain protein from Drosophila melanogaster (residues 43\u201358, Penetratin) were shown to have biological activity in neuronal cells, which was attributed to the cell penetrating properties of the peptide [30], [31], [32]. Another cell penetrating peptide (CPP) was discovered in the basic region of HIV-1 Tat protein (residues 48\u201360) [33]. Many CPPs (also known as \u201cprotein transduction domains\u201d) with remarkable properties of cell penetration either on their own, or as conjugates with a range of other types of biomolecules, such as peptides, proteins, liposomes and nanoparticles have now been characterised (reviewed in [34]). However, very few examples of strong delivery and biological activity of negatively charged ON or siRNA cargoes into cells through covalent attachment of a CPP have been published (reviewed in [35], [36], [37]), and in many cases, the conjugation of a peptide does not allow sufficient cargo delivery through the endocytotic pathway and into the cell compartments necessary for biological activity.",

For PNA\u2013peptides, an early example was the blocking of expression of the galanin receptor mRNA in human Bowes cells by a 21-mer PNA disulfide-coupled to the CPPs Penetratin or Transportan (a hybrid of a section of the neuropeptide galanin and the wasp venom peptide mastoparan), which constituted a step towards the modification of pain transmission [38]. Remarkably potent inhibition (down to 70\u201380 nM EC50) in the same model was claimed with shorter PNAs targeting different regions of the mRNA and conjugated to a truncated Transportan version TP10 [39]. This is exceptional, since most cellular inhibition of protein translation by PNA has been achieved only in the \u03bcM range. For example a 13-mer PNA disulfide-linked to Penetratin was able to inhibit telomerase activity in JR8 melanoma cells with IC50\n \u223c 7 \u03bcM [40]. In a different model system, an amphipathic peptide, MAP, disulfide-conjugated to a PNA complementary to the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor mRNA was shown to impart improved cell uptake and steric block biological effects in both CHO cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes again in the \u03bcM range [41]. When linked to a D(AAKK)4 peptide, a 19-mer PNA complementary to human caveolin 1 mRNA inhibited expression in HeLa cells (IC50\n = 2 \u03bcM) and in primary endothelial cells at concentrations > 15 \u03bcM [42].",

Strategies for manual or automated PNA synthesis by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/benzhydryloxycarbonyl (Fmoc/Bhoc) or tert-butyloxycarbonyl/carbobenzyloxy (Boc/Cbz) routes are well established [62], [63], [64]. Thus peptide\u2013PNA conjugates may be assembled by continuous synthesis with activated amino acids or activated PNA monomers being added in the coupling reactions. In general there are no restrictions in combining amino acids with PNA residues and these may be added in any order. It is common to include at least one Lys residue on the end of a PNA synthesis to aid water solubility. Fmoc/Bhoc chemistry is more often preferred for PNA assembly and we have reported protocols for PNA and PNA\u2013peptide syntheses using a robotic Apex 396 Synthesizer [65]. A short polyether spacer (AEEA, 8-amino-3,5-dioxo-octanoic acid, also known as an O-linker) is often added between the peptide and PNA moieties in continuous synthesis (Fig. 1a) [66], [67].",

Each fragment is synthesized separately on solid-phase and contains a specific functionality on one end. Each fragment is purified prior to the conjugation step. Usually, an excess of one component is added over the other to drive the conjugation reaction to completion and the product conjugate is purified by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry. No general rules have yet emerged as to optimal linkage types, since the factors affecting biological activity are often complex. For example, in some studies, use of labile disulfide linkages has resulted in higher biological activities [67], [68]. By contrast, a stable thioether linkage or a disulfide linkage gave equally good results in a splicing redirection system [69].",

Both CPP and PNA are functionalized with a Cys residue, and the disulfide bond is formed between the Cys thiol groups. One of the thiols is activated by reaction with either a pyridylsulfenyl or a 3-nitropyridylsulfenyl group. We have used the disulfide linkage predominantly in studies of HIV Tat-dependent trans-activation inhibition and in splicing redirection [67], [69].

The nuclear antisense activities of the CPP\u2013PMOs with the three linkage types were similar ([74] and Moulton, H. M, unpublished results). Synthetically, the amide linkage has two advantages over disulfide and thioether linkages. First a PMO can easily be conjugated to a CPP via an amine at either end of the oligomer. Second, formation of an amide bond requires only a one-step synthetic and purification scheme as compared to a two-step strategy for other linkages. Therefore, the amide linkage leads to an overall greater yield of CPP\u2013PMO. In addition, amide bonds appear to be more stable in vivo, since an unhindered disulfide-linked CPP\u2013PMO was found to be unstable in human serum [76].",

Luciferase expression is however highly sensitive to cell density and other variables as pointed by Bendifallah et al. [68].

Intriguingly, splicing correction was claimed to be energy-independent [12], at variance with most recent data on the mechanism of cellular uptake of basic amino acid-rich CPP-conjugated ON [82]. In our hands, (Lys)8\u2013PNA conjugates were efficiently taken up in cells as monitored by FACS analysis and by fluorescence microscopy, but their biological activity remained rather low, in keeping with our previous data with Tat- or Arg-rich steric block ON conjugates [83]. Interestingly, cellular uptake was clearly energy-dependent at low concentration, but became temperature-independent at high concentration, in parallel with membrane destabilization as monitored by propidium iodide uptake [83]. Endocytosis may be thus the predominant mechanism of uptake at low concentrations, while direct translocation linked to CPP-induced membrane destabilization could take place at higher concentrations. CPP-induced membrane permeabilization may itself be rather dependent on peptide, cell type and experimental conditions, providing a possible explanation for the ongoing controversy concerning CPP mechanism of cell uptake. Sequestration of internalized material in endocytotic vesicles could also explain the observed low biological activity of these various CPP conjugates. Indeed, treatment with endosomolytic agents, such as chloroquine or high sucrose, gave rise to a large increase in splice correcting activity even when added after CPP\u2013PNA internalization [83].",

Wender and their colleagues on the assumption that not all Arg side chains in an oligo Arg peptide would point in the same direction and would therefore be available for HSPG (or membrane lipid polar heads) binding. They accordingly designed and synthesized a large collection of (RXR)nR, (RX)nR, (RXX)nR and (RXXX)nR transport peptides in which X represents various natural or non-natural amino acids [92]. All peptides were conjugated to fluorescein and assayed for cellular uptake in a Jurkat T cell line. These studies emphasized the crucial role of Arg side chain spacing for cellular uptake, and the most efficient peptide was (R-Ahx-R)4R in which Ahx represents a 6-atom aminohexanoic acid spacer. This strategy of interspersing Arg residues with non-natural, uncharged amino acids also appeared interesting in decreasing the number of natural peptide bonds (thus providing increased metabolic stability) and in decreasing the positive charge density often responsible for cytotoxicity. However, no studies of biological responses were reported, although the synthesis of conjugates to cyclosporin or acyclovir has been described [93]. (R-Ahx-R)4 was chosen therefore as a lead peptide and has been stably conjugated to a PMO oligomer via a Ahx-\u03b2-Ala linker. At variance with Tat\u2013PMO and Arg6\u2013PMO conjugates, (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO leads to a dose-dependent and specific increase of luciferase expression in the absence of endosomolytic agents.

It is not yet clear why R6Pen is more efficient than other CPPs, such as Penetratin. For example, an essential difference has been documented using a mutant of the R6Pen peptide in which a Trp residue known to be essential for Pen peptide to penetrate membranes has been replaced by a Leu residue. This R6Pen (W \u2192 L) mutant is even more active than the wild-type R6Pen version (Fig. 4a) [66]. This suggests that the mechanism of cell entry and release into cytosol and nucleus must differ significantly between the R6Pen\u2013PNA conjugate and the Pen peptide. Further, the importance of the appended oligo-Arg tail is affirmed by varying the number of Arg residues. Neither shorter nor longer tails are as efficient as the original R6Pen peptide [66]. Further SAR studies are underway aimed at understanding better the roles of various domains of the R6Pen peptide, at enhancing conjugate activity and serum stability, and at decreasing cytotoxicity.",

The role of a delivery vector is obviously to transport a cargo to its intracellular site. Intracellular dissociation between the two entities would intuitively be preferred, since it would be predicted to avoid steric hindrance or other potential complications. However, the situation is more complex for steric block ON analogues, since a bound, highly charged delivery peptide should increase affinity for the targeted RNA sequence and favour invasion of secondary structures, thus leading to enhanced activity [96]. We thus compared splicing correction efficiency and the specificity of PNA sequences conjugated to R6Pen through a stable (thioether) or a reducible (disulfide) linker. The disulfide-linked material is only slightly more efficient than the stably linked one (Fig. 4b). All data gathered so far with stably linked (R-Ahx-R)4 or R6Pen conjugates indicate that the appended CPPs do not prevent target recognition and do not alter oligomer sequence specificity. Alternatively, the similar activity of the stably- and disulfide-linked material could be due to equal rates of intracellular degradation of the peptidic delivery vector of both compounds.",

A mouse model of muscular dystrophy (mdx) has been used to study the effectiveness of free PMO and CPP\u2013PMO conjugate. Mdx mice carry a nonsense mutation in exon 23. Excision of exon 23 in mdx mouse cells can restore mostly-functional dystrophin expression [26]. Unconjugated PMO targeted to a donor site of exon 23 partially restored dystrophin function in skeletal muscles of mdx mice at 100 mg/kg/dose intravenously [26] or at 25 mg/kg/dose intra-peritoneally [97], both with 7 consecutive weekly doses. The PMO conjugated to (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB CPP produced high efficacy when administered intra-peritoneally at 5 mg/kg /dose once a week for 4 weeks [53]. The dystrophin level in diaphragm muscles of mdx mice, detected two weeks after a single intra-peritoneal injection of (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO, was similar to the levels in normal mice. Four doses of the conjugate at 5 mg/kg/dose, administered once a week for four weeks to neonatal mice, resulted in normal levels of dystrophin in the diaphragms of 6-week-old mice. At 22 weeks post the fourth injection, dystrophin was still detectable in the diaphragm. The conjugate effect was lower in the tibialis anterior, gluteus maximus, and triceps brachialis, weaker still in the colon and stomach, and absent in the heart. Western blots detected normal levels of dystrophin in the diaphragm at six weeks, lower levels in the tibialis and gluteus, but no dystrophin was detected in cardiac muscle. Animals of one day, four weeks or one year of age were treated to test the effect of age. Whilst splice-modified dystrophin expression increased for all ages treated, muscle architecture was most improved in mice treated at younger age. Normalized pathology and central nucleation were observed for the sections taken from the 6-week-old mice treated with (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO. The study revealed that treatment of DMD mice at a young age is more beneficial than at an older age [53].",

Conjugation of a PMO to the (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB peptide increased the tissue uptake and retention [98]. The CPP conjugation increased uptake of PMO in all organs assayed, except in brain, with greater increases being seen in liver, spleen and lungs. Remarkably, a similar amount of PMO was still detected in the liver 5 days after the last dose, indicating that the conjugated PMO had a long retention time in this organ. Interestingly, the concentration of conjugated PMO in rat spleens assayed 5 days after the last dose was twice the concentration in rat spleens assayed 1 day after the last dose. These results suggest that efflux of the conjugated PMO from tissues to the vascular space is slow, which is an important consideration for its therapeutic applications. Conjugation of PMO to (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB improved the kinetic behaviour of PMO as demonstrated by a 4-fold increased in volume of distribution, 2-fold increase in the estimated elimination half life, and an increased area under the plasma concentration versus time curve.",

The degree of toxicity depends on the dose, dose frequency and route of administration. Mice tolerated (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMOs well with repeated doses at \u2264 10 mg/kg [43], [48], [53], [98], [99]. Four daily i.p. injections into mice at 3.7 mg/kg of an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO conjugate did not produce any observable toxicity [99]. No changes in mice behaviour, weight and serum chemistry were observed for the mdx mice injected intraperitoneally with the conjugate at 5 mg/kg once a week for four weeks [53]. No histopathological abnormalities were detected in heart, liver, kidney, spleen and pancreas after two i.v. doses of an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO conjugate administered 48 h apart at 10 and 15 mg/kg [43]. However, at higher doses and dosing frequency, animals experienced weight loss. Mice lost weight after five daily doses (i.p.) at 15 mg/kg of an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO conjugate despite maintaining their normal organ weights and appearances. Fibrosis was found in the livers of treated animals. These mice regained their normal weights after the treatment was stopped [48]. Five daily intravenous injections of an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO to rats at 15 mg/kg did not cause any detectable toxicity, as measured by behaviour, appearance, eating/drinking habits, body weight and serum chemistry. Rats treated with a single 150 mg/kg dose appeared lethargic immediately after the injection and proceeded to lose weight, accompanied by elevated serum BUN and creatinine, indicating that kidney function was most likely affected. The LD50 of an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO in rats was around 220\u2013250 mg/kg [98].",

An 18-mer PNA complementary to the enhancer E\u03bc intronic sequence and stably linked to a 7-mer NLS peptide inhibited c-myc oncogene expression in Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) cells [100] and showed very little toxicity in a human tumour SCID mice model [101]. When inoculated subcutaneously, the NLS\u2013PNA showed inhibition of BL cell-induced tumour growth in SCID mice [102]. A PNA conjugated to K8 showed broad tissue distribution in mice after i.v. injection and a relatively slow excretion level [56], whereas two Lys/Arg-rich amphipathic D-peptides stably conjugated to a PNA distributed substantially differently in mice [57].",

For example, CPPs have been shown to be powerful vectors to deliver PMOs into the cytosol of cells. There have been a number of reports of CPP\u2013PMO inhibition of virus replication in cell cultures and in mouse models. Coxsackievirus B3 is a picornavirus and a significant cause of myocarditis, especially in children and adolescents. An (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO targeting the Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) in the 5' UTR of the Coxsackievirus B3 viral genome reduced viral titer by 4 logs in virus infected cells in culture. Two 10 mg/kg doses of the IRES-targeted compound, administered intravenously once 3 h before and once 2 days after infection with virus, reduced heart tissue damage and viral titer by about 100-fold, when measured at one week post-infection [43]. The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus raised the threat of a worldwide pandemic in 2002\u20132003. Experiments in cultured cells showed that antisense R9F2C\u2013PMO dramatically reduced virus-induced cytopathic effects, viral titers, and cell to cell spread of the virus [44]. Recently, in mouse models with a variety of murine coronaviruses, an (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO, administrated intraperitoneally, reduced liver damage and viral titers, reflecting the improved survival observed [99].",

However, CPP toxicity and endosomal entrapment appear to be limiting factors to the potential for systemic delivery of steric blocking ONs to humans. Future studies on the nature of the toxicity, endosomal entrapment and uptake mechanism of CPP-ONs will hopefully instruct the design of the next generation of CPPs having a higher therapeutic index. At the current time, CPP-ONs are more suitable for diseases amenable to either local treatments, infrequent systemic dosing, such as DMD, or perhaps a small number of systemic treatments, such as some acute viral infections. An initial Phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a CPP\u2013PMO conjugate for the ex-vivo treatment of vein tissue in coronary artery bypass grafts has started in Poland and Ukraine. This clinical trial will evaluate AVI-5126, a (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PMO targeted to human c-myc, and is designed to prevent inappropriate cell proliferation that can occur after the grafting procedure and frequently causes eventual failure of the grafted vein. Excised vein tissue will be immersed in a solution containing 10 \u03bcM AVI-5126 for 30 min and then implanted as a bypass graft (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Hopefully, further clinical trials with CPP\u2013PMO will become possible soon, and further commercial development of CPP\u2013PNA as well.",
