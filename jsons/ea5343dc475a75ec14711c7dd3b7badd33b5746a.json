The survival rate differs in the various types of cannulation techniques. Adult patients with prolonged duration of ECMO constitute the major risk population. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections form the main sources of sepsis in these patients. It is important to know the most common etiological agents for sepsis in ECMO, which varies partly with the local epidemiology of the hospitals. A high index of suspicion, drawing adequate volumes for blood culture and early and timely administration of appropriate empirical antimicrobials can substantially decrease the morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. The dosing of antimicrobials is influenced by the pharmacological variations on ECMO machine and is an important consideration. Infection control practices are of paramount importance and need to be followed meticulously to prevent sepsis in ECMO.",

Age: Adult patients who undergo ECMO are at greater risk for developing a nosocomial infection and sepsis than neonates and children (20.5% of adults vs. 6.1% of neonates and pediatric patients develop culture-proven infections during ECMO) [7] . b. Duration of ECMO: The time duration of ECMO support carries a directly proportionate risk of a patient acquiring serious infection during ECMO and is associated with a significantly increased rate of death [9, 10] . Burket et al. [11] had shown that the bloodstream infection (BSI) rate increased with the duration of ECMO support. The rate of BSI was 9.5 cases per 1000 ECMO-days among patients who underwent ECMO for 3-10 days, 27.2 cases per 1000 ECMO-days and 64.5 cases per 1000 ECMO-days, among those who underwent ECMO for 11-20 days and 21-30 days, respectively. In the study done by Kim et al. [12] , the incidence of infection increased proportionately with time on ECMO (Table 1) .",

            "text": "c. Presence of foreign devices: Any foreign device serves as a portal of entry for micro-organisms and predisposes to sepsis. In ECMO patients, the presence of intravascular devices, such as central venous catheters, intra-arterial lines, large-bore ECMO cannulae, endotracheal tubes, and intra-aortic balloon pumps, all cause disruption of the protective barrier mechanism of skin and help pathogens gain entry into the human system [13] . In addition, multiple ports on these devices can get contaminated and this adds further to the ongoing risk of acquiring nosocomial sepsis. d. Comorbidities: Sun et al. [14] have reported an increased risk of infection in patients who had autoimmune comorbidities or who were on a chronic immunosuppressive regimen. Out of the 10 patients with autoimmune disease, 5 developed infections (p value 0.003). The diseases included were systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and scleroderma. It was found that 8 of these patients had received high-dose immunosuppression before initiating ECMO which might have compromised their immunity and predisposed them to sepsis. e. Cannulation techniques and circuit of ECMO: In the neonatal population, there is a 25% increased risk of infective complications with the VA-ECMO modality, as compared with the VV-ECMO [15] . Even studies in older children show a similar trend [7, 9] . Only one study done by Sun et al. [14] surprisingly found a greater infection risk in VV-ECMO patients when compared with VA-ECMO, but these results could be due to the more severe underlying medical conditions in VV-ECMO patients in that study. The double-lumen internal jugular cannulae have also been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of infection in the adult population [15] . On the other hand, femoral cannulation may increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) and sepsis during ECMO. f. Severity of illness: A high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [16] before cannulation, has been found to be an independent risk factor for sepsis especially in adults. The overall SOFA score was an average of 10.6 in the infected group versus 8.3 in the noninfected group (p = 0.030) [17] and was statistically significant for BSIs too (on average 13 in the BSI group versus 12 in the non-BSI group; p = 0.038) [7] .",

            "text": "A high index of suspicion is very important to detect early sepsis and reduce mortality in these high-risk patients. The most important challenge is to differentiate clinically between sepsis and SIRS [29] , as the latter is common in these patients because of underlying cardiac or pulmonary insult and also due to complex circuits of ECMO. Both clinical examination and biomarkers play an important role. It is important to note that the critically ill patients may have some degree of baseline hyperthermia which always does not denote infection [30] . However, patients on ECMO, who are able to produce fever of at least 101 degrees or more are likely to have a high inflammatory response and should be closely monitored [31] for other signs of infection. Patients also should be monitored for any new hypothermia, hemodynamic instability, increased respiratory distress with desaturation, purulent tracheal secretions, frank pyuria or fall in urine output requiring renal replacement therapy, alteration in sensorium, coagulopathy, and new skin lesions (purpura fulminans). All these clinical pointers may indicate sepsis and call for timely intervention. Laboratory parameters such as leukocytosis and leucopenia are not very accurate in ECMO patients [31] . A retrospective analysis in neonates failed to demonstrate predictive value of white blood cell (WBC) counts for nosocomial infections in patients on ECMO [32] . In the same way, thrombocytopenia is also to be interpreted with caution as it is fairly common due to the activation by ECMO circuits [31] . Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) are important sensitive tools in diagnostic evaluation but they are not specific. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been documented as a more specific biomarker of systemic infection and sepsis than the previous conventional markers like WBC count and CRP [33] . Pieri et al. [34] showed in his study that in patients who were receiving VA-ECMO, PCT has good accuracy with the cutoff of 1.89 ng/mL (sensitivity 87.8%, specificity 50%) and CRP having cutoff of 97.70 mg/L is 85.3% sensitive and 41.6% specific. However, PCT was not found to be a reliable marker of sepsis in VV-ECMO in this study. The PCT and CRP as a combined assay had a very high overall sensitivity of 87.2%, though specificity was 25.9%. Another study was done by Tanaka et al. [35] , where he studied the effectiveness of PCT in differentiating infection from SIRS in patients on ECMO and found that PCT with a cutoff of 2 had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 82% with a positive predictive value of 82% and negative predictive value of 90%. The better specificity in this study was hypothesized to be due to exclusion of PCT assays after prolonged systemic malperfusion. Nevertheless, PCT has to be interpreted with caution as elevated levels can be found in situations of massive stress like post trauma, post-surgery, severe cardiogenic shock, and compromised renal function [36] . Hence, PCT should not be used as an isolated test for diagnosis of sepsis, and it preferably should be clinically correlated using serial values to see a rising or falling trend. It has greater value in de-escalation of antibiotics in sepsis in ICU patients [37] and this can be easily extrapolated for ECMO patient also.",

In addition to Gram-positive coverage with drugs such as vancomycin, it becomes prudent to broaden cover by adding high-end antibiotics such as carbapenems, polymyxins, and/or fosfomycin especially in hemodynamically unstable patients. Usually these highly critical patients warrant combination therapy initially for control of sepsis which can be de-escalated later based upon the culture sensitivity reports.",

[41] showed in his results that candidemia occurred in the third week after VA-ECMO implantation and hence antifungal therapy should not be added upfront in empirical regimen in the first 2 weeks of ECMO-related septic shock. Nevertheless, the decision regarding antifungals should be supported by clinical judgement and individualized as per patient needs. Echinocandins remain the class of choice in the hemodynamically unstable patients and this stands true for ECMO population too.",

Altered clearance of the drugs: Alteration in kidney function is common in ECMO and can increase the chance of drug toxicity of those antibiotics which are primarily excreted through renal route. c.
