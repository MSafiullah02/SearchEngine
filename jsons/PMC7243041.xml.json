In addition, the World Health Organization determined on 30 January 2020 that the spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). By the 6 April 2020, 1,174,866 confirmed cases had been documented worldwide.3 In general, COVID-19 is an acute resolved disease, but it can also be deadly, with a 2% case fatality rate. Although most patients exhibit mild symptoms, like fever, fatigue and dry cough, around 15\u201320% patients quickly became severe cases that had respiratory difficulty and failure.4 The severe group and the more severe group show a higher mortality rate, caused mostly by multiple organ function damage,5 so effective therapies for improving the survival of critical patients are necessary for current treatment.",

This novel coronavirus is thought to be the causative agent of the emerging pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 infection is a clustering onset and transmissive disease. Most patients infected had fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue.5 For the diagnosed severe group, rapidly progressing comorbidities, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and dysfunction of coagulation, were found.8 From experimental analysis, leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 \u00d7 109/l) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 \u00d7 109/l) are the most common phenomena, which are almost consistent with results in TEN. Some inflammatory markers in serum, like C-reactive protein and D dimer, are also consistently elevated in both diseases.9 Further comparison between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients showed that the concentrations of TNF\u03b1; interleukins-2, -7, and-10 (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10); granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and 1A (MCP1, MIP1A) in plasma were increased in ICU patients (always in severe group). These cytokines are probably leading to an activated T-helper-1 (Th1) and activated T-helper-2 cell response.5",

Besides, pulmonary dysfunction also was reported in patients with TEN, which also could lead to ARDS, shock, and electrolyte disturbances.

Besides, type II alveolar epithelial cells proliferated significantly, and some cells were shed. Viral inclusions can be identified in type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. There was vascular congestion and pulmonary edema with mononuclear and lymphocyte infiltration and intravascular hyaline thrombus in alveolar septal.

CD4+T cells in the epidermis and dermis also play a role as a stimulator for various immune cells, contributing to TNF\u03b1 and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Keratinocytes were activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and TNF\u03b1 were shown to undergo self-apoptosis. The historical results of COVID-19 severe patients suggested diffuse alveolar damage.

According to immunologic research, granulysin and TNF\u03b1 expression levels decreased significantly with increased Treg population in the etanercept group compared with the corticosteroid group.20 The pathology of severe group COVID-19 pneumonia revealed that immune cells, especially CD8+T cells and Th17, were connected with the pathogenesis of the disease. A study of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 showed that a majority of patients (58.0%) received intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 35.8% received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir). Besides, oxygen therapy was administered in 41.3%, which was applied more in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.21 Although previous routine treatments of COVID-19 pneumonia were antibiotic and antiviral drugs and oxygen therapy, the efficacy of antiviral treatments is controversial and the abuse of antibiotic drugs should be avoided.",

Treatments that restrain over-activated inflammatory responses may ideally reduce the progression of virus-mediated immune-pathogenesis. Although, up to now, use of etanercept in COVID-19 pneumonia lacks sufficient evidence, we believe it is imperative to report our assumption of a better attempt at treating severe group COVID-19 related disease. Compared with SARS and MERS, there are currently no specific drugs that can clear virus completely. Therefore, further experiments and efforts should be taken to identify therapeutic targets of etanercept by conducting a prospective, open-label, randomized comparison study of etanercept versus supportive care.",
