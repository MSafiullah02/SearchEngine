These disturbances might depend on a direct effect of the SARS-CoV-2, but also on well-known precipitating factors such as prolonged hospitalization, pain, constipation, urinary retention and a broad range of metabolic abnormalities that occur during the course of a severe infection. Delirium has previously been estimated to occur in up to 50% of hospitalized elderly patients and 80% of critically ill patients who receive mechanical ventilation [2] , and reported rates are likely to rise by the end of this ongoing pandemic. Although pathogenetic mechanisms of delirium are poorly understood, crucial contributing roles have been hypothesized for neurotransmitter imbalance, proinflammatory cytokines, tissue hypoxia and sleep deprivation.",
