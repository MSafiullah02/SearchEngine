            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a novel betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was isolated in late 2012 in Saudi Arabia [1]. The syndrome (MERS) is described as a viral infection that causes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath and to a lesser extent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea [2]. Severe disease from MERS-CoV infection can cause respiratory failure and organ failure, and cases can be fatal, especially in patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiac complications. However, the infection can be asymptomatic or mild in many cases [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries and infected more than 1900 humans with a mortality rate of 40% [2]. Dromedary camels, especially juveniles, contract the infection and shed the virus, without notable symptoms of disease; this is now known to have been occurring since the early 1980s [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The mechanism of camel to human transmission is still not clear, but several primary cases have been associated with camel contact, which is considered an important risk factor [14], [15], [16]. Therefore, camels are being considered an intermediate host and one of the sources of MERS-CoV infection [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Other livestock animals such as sheep, goats, cows, chicken, and horses have proved seronegative in many studies [17], [18], [19], [20]. Further, these animals did not productively contract MERS-CoV when they were inoculated experimentally [21], [22]. Therefore, to date, dromedary camels are the only confirmed animal reservoir. There is currently no approved vaccine against MERS\u2010CoV for camels or humans despite active vaccine research and development. A number of vaccine candidates have been developed using various platforms and regimens and have been tested in several animal models [23]. Viral vectors are potent platform technologies that have been utilised to develop vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, HIV, HCV, Ebola, and many viral pathogens. These vectors include adenoviruses, poxviruses, yellow fever viruses, and alphaviruses [24], [25], and they are preferred for their ability to induce cellular immune responses in addition to humoral immunity. Here, we report development of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates that are based on two different viral vectors: Chimpanzee Adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1) [26] and Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) [27], [28]. Each viral vector was developed by generating two alternative versions, resulting in four vaccine candidates that all encode the same complete MERS-CoV spike gene (S). The two ChAdOx1 based vaccines were produced with or without the signal peptide of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) at the N terminus. Previous studies have shown that encoding tPA upstream of recombinant antigens enhanced immunogencity, although results differed depending on the antigens employed. The tPA encoded upstream of influenza A virus nucleoprotein, in a DNA vector, enhanced both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice [29], [30], whereas the same leader sequence resulted in increased humoral sequences but decreased cellular responses to HIV Gag [30]. The two MVA based vaccines were produced with either the mH5 or F11 poxviral promoter driving antigen expression, both including the tPA sequence at the N terminus of MERS-CoV Spike protein. Previously, we reported the ability of the strong early F11 promoter to enhance cellular immunogenicity of vaccine antigen candidates for malaria and influenza, as compared to utilising p7.5 or mH5 early/late promoters which resulted in a lower level of gene expression immediately after virus infection of target cells, but higher levels at a later stage [31]. Here, we continue to assess the F11 promoter in enhancing cellular immunogenicity, and to investigate its ability to impact on humoral immune responses. The four vaccine candidates were evaluated in a number of different regimens in mouse models that showed a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS inducing higher cellular and humoral immunogenicity than a single dose of MVA MERS, or equivalent to two doses of MVA MERS. ChAdOx1 based vaccines have been tested in different animal models, including camels [32], and in human clinical trials and proved safe and immunogenic [33]. Therefore, based on our data, ChAdOx1 MERS can be readily developed for use as a MERS vaccine in humans. Furthermore, utilising ChAdOx1 MERS for camel vaccination can serve the one-health approach whereby blocking MERS-CoV transmission in camels is expected to prevent human infections.",

The S transgene was then cloned into four shuttle plasmid vectors following In-Fusion cloning (Clontech). Two plasmids contained the S transgene within the E1 homologous region of ChAdOx1, driven by the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV) that includes intron A. One of the ChAdOx1 shuttle plasmids was designed to include the tPA signal sequence upstream of the transgene sequence while the second plasmid did not contain the tPA. The ChAdOx1 shuttle plasmids contained the S transgene within Gateway\u00ae recombination cassettes. To construct MVA MERS, one of the shuttle plasmids for MVA was designed to have the upstream and downstream (flanks) of the F11L ORF as homologous sequence arms. Inserting the S transgene within these arms enabled the utilisation of the endogenous F11 promoter, which is part of the right homologous arm, while deleting the native F11L ORF. This resulted in the shuttle vector for generation of F11-MVA MERS (F11 shuttle vector). The mH5 promoter sequence was subcloned upstream of the S transgene; and this mH5-S transgene was then subcloned into the F11 shuttle vector. This resulted in the shuttle vector for generation of mH5-MVA MERS (F11/mH5 shuttle vector). mH5-MVA MERS contained the mH5 promoter at the F11L locus, however, the endogenous F11 promoter is intact and located upstream of the mH5 promoter. The endogenous F11 promoter could not be replaced with the mH5 since it is part of the essential upstream ORF.",

ChAdOx1 MERS genomes were then derived in HEK293A cell lines (Invitrogen, Cat. R705-07), the resultant viruses were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described [34]. The titres were determined on HEK293A cells using anti-hexon immunostaining assay based on the QuickTiter\u2122 Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay kit (Cell Biolabs Inc). For MVA MERS vaccines chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CEFs) were infected with MVA parental virus that encodes dsRed marker instead of the native F11L ORF and transfected with MVA shuttle plasmids containing MERS-CoV spike gene (explained above) to allow recombination with the MVA genome and deletion of dsRed marker whilst keeping the F11 promoter sequence. Recombinant MVA expressing MERS-CoV S protein was purified by plaque-picking and fluorescent selection using the sorting function of CyCLONE robotic module of a MoFlo Flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation, Denmark) as previously described [31]. F11-MVA MERS and mH5-MVA MERS were confirmed to lack the native F11L ORF (and the dsRed marker), and contain MERS-CoV S by PCR (identity and purity PCR screening). The sequence of the S transgene amplified from these vaccines was confirmed. The recombinant viruses (vaccines) were amplified in 1500 cm2 monolayers of CEFs cells, partially purified over sucrose cushions and titrated in CEFs cells according to standard practice, and purity and identity were again verified by PCR.",

Four recombinant viral vectors, two ChAdOx1 and two MVA, were derived as described in the materials and methods. ChAdOx1 based vaccine candidates were generated with or without the signal peptide of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA). The spike transgene expression in ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine candidates is under the control of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (CMV IE) that includes intron A. In MVA MERS vaccine candidates, the tPA was also inserted upstream of the spike transgene, which was under the control of either the ectopic mH5 promoter or the endogenous F11 promoter (Fig. 1A). All of our MERS-CoV vaccine candidates contain the same codon-optimized spike transgene. The expression of the newly synthesized transgene was first tested by transfection of an African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero cells) with the adenovirus shuttle vector, and immunofluorescence staining of the transfected cells (Fig. 1B and 1C). This was performed to confirm the expression of the codon optimized spike transgene in mammalian cells. The level of transgene expression from the four vaccine candidates was not evaluated in vitro.

All vaccine candidates focused on the spike antigen because it contains the receptor-binding domain used for cell entry by the virus, against which neutralising antibodies may be induced, and it is conserved. Therefore, the improvement of MERS-CoV vaccines focuses on platform and vaccination regimens rather than antigen selection and optimisation. Here, we focused on using the same antigen (transgene) to develop a vaccine against MERS-CoV, and to assess different vectors, different versions of each vector, and different vaccination regimens. We generated a number of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates based on the same codon optimized spike transgene and ensured its expression in vitro before we evaluated the humoral and cellular immunogenicity in a pre-clinical BALB/c mouse model. ChAdOx1 based vaccine candidates were produced with or without tPA. The tPA signal peptide was predicted to enhance the humoral immunogenicity of encoded vaccine antigens, based on previous reports [29]. Our data supported this hypothesis and showed a significant increase in the S1-specific antibody levels at 28 d.p.i. The level of neutralising antibodies was also increased when tPA was utilised. However, ChAdOx1 MERS without tPA was still a potent vaccine candidate, inducing a high level of both S1-specific binding antibodies and MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies. Neutralisation activity of mouse serum antibodies was assayed by using MERS-CoV pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp), an approach used by a number of researchers for other human pathogens such as HIV, Influenza, and HCV to overcome the necessity of handling BSL-3 viruses [40]. Additionally, we confirmed the ability of serum samples from vaccinated mice to neutralise live MERS virus. We therefore selected ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA (simply referred to ChAdOx1 MERS) for further evaluation.",

Modest effects on immunogenicity of different versions of the vaccines were noted, with the use of the tPA leader sequence in ChAdOx1, and the use of the F11 promoter in MVA producing small increases in immunogenicity compared to no leader sequence, or the mH5 promoter. The protective level of either antibodies or cellular immunity required to counter MERS-CoV infection in humans or in animal models is not yet defined, despite some efforts [48], [49], [50], [51]. The ideal vaccine would provide rapid onset of immunity and complete protective efficacy after a single dose, with a long duration of immunity. Complete protective efficacy of one dose of ChAdOx1 expressing the external glycoprotein of Rift Valley Fever Virus has been demonstrated in multiple species and it is already known that ChAdOx1 RVF is highly immunogenic in camels [32]. To date, the only vaccine against MERS to be tested in camels is an MVA vectored vaccine [41] which was protective in hDPP4 transgenic mice immunised with a homologous prime/boost regimen [37] but in camels required two doses given both intranasally and intramuscularly to provide partial protection and reduction of virus shedding [45]. Here we find that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS is as immunogenic as two doses of MVA MERS, suggesting that this regimen should be tested for protective efficacy in camels. However if this is not completely protective, administration of MVA MERS as a heterologous boost should be considered next. In our hands one dose of MVA resulted in an endpoint titre of 3 logs, two doses of MVA produced 4.7 logs, one dose of ChAdOx1 produced 5 logs, and ChAdOx1/MVA prime boost produced 5.9 logs. If a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERs is not protective and a two dose regimen is required, ChAdOx1/MVA would be more likely to provide complete protection than MVA/MVA.",
