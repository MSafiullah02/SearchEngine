Within a week of the initial case report in April 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent an expert team to Guinea. Within the following months, over 2,000 other CDC employees deployed in response to outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with many more working on the public health response from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.10 Other governmental agencies (e.g., United States Agency for International Development) from the United States (US) and many other countries, and more than 65 non-governmental agencies, most prominently, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)/ Doctors Without Borders and Partners In Health, also sent health care volunteers on medical missions to West Africa to respond to the epidemic and to provide care to patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD).11 It is estimated that ultimately thousands of health care workers from throughout the world voluntarily deployed to the West Africa Ebola epidemic.",

As of May, 2016, over 11,000 deaths were reported among the estimated 28,000 suspected, probable or confirmed cases of Ebola, (average case fatality rate =39%).13 According to a 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) report, infected health care providers had an even greater risk of mortality; during the epidemic, over 50% (418/814) of Ebola infected health care workers died, with the highest case fatality rates (68%) observed among nurses (193/285).14 The impact on the health care workforce in affected countries was sizeable. According to a Lancet report published in July 2015, Guinea lost 1.45% of their healthcare workforce, while Liberia and Sierra Leone lost 8.07% and 6.85%, respectively.15 It is important to note that in some of the areas severely affected by the Ebola epidemic, health care access was already severely limited, with roughly only one or two doctors per 100,000 people.16\n",

Although there is no mechanism currently in place to track this, an estimated 200,000 health care personnel from the US are believed to volunteer each year to underserved or disaster-affected areas around the world.17 Many volunteer through the more than 1000 non-governmental sponsor organizations, which may be faith-based, university-based, or sponsored by educational or corporate entities. These organizations recruit through their internet presence, word-of-mouth, or through targeted advertising. A recent survey of 177 voluntary health care organizations found that more than half accepted 75% or more of all health care applicants into their volunteer programs.17 The same survey also found a wide range of preparation provided to volunteers, ranging from simply providing an \u2018orientation packet\u2019 of materials to extensive, in-person training. For Ebola deployments, the CDC developed an intensive experiential training course for US health care workers deploying to West Africa; over 600 US workers eventually received this training.18 Similar courses were developed by MSF and WHO.19\n,\n20 Even with this extensive training in place, some experts, including leadership at numerous US academic medical centers, urged caution to staff and fellows considering voluntary deployment. This was due to concerns regarding the effectiveness and implementation of safety precautions, the high fatality rate, and the lack of effective treatments at that time.21\n",

Hands-on simulated training is essential for complex infection control practices that may be unfamiliar to most health care volunteers.

Specialized counseling at the pre-deployment stage should be targeted towards both volunteers and their families in order to help reduce fear, anxiety, and resentment of family members. Pre-deployment counseling might also help volunteers cope with other types of stressors they may commonly face during the deployment (fear, work-related problems, mental and physical exhaustion), as well as after the deployment (quarantine challenges, shunning, stigmatization, and sense of isolation). Volunteers must be provided with full disclosure of the procedures that will have to be followed upon return in terms of quarantine. This is especially important because the US does not have extensive experience or uniformity with regards to quarantine policies or procedures, and there was (and remains) a lack of standardized management of health care volunteers returning from highly contagious and lethal infectious disease deployments.33\n,\n34 Volunteers to hot zone missions need to know what to expect upon initial reentry into the US, and upon return to their particular home state and local jurisdiction, as quarantine laws vary considerably around the country.35 For large scale events, the CDC has an important role to play to help reduce stigmatization of returning volunteers and their families by launching general public information campaigns. These types of campaigns might better prepare communities to both send and receive returning volunteers.

We noted a striking similarity between post-deployment feelings reported in this study with those reported by returning war veterans.

Moral injury is believed to result when military personnel are confronted with ethical and moral challenges that transgress deeply held beliefs and morals.44\n,\n45 In our study, participants frequently witnessed suffering, undignified death, and limited ability to provide quality of care\u2014and these exposures may have resulted in moral injury as the symptoms commonly associated with moral injury (shame, guilt, remorse, and demoralization)45 were frequently reported by our study participants. While moral injury is different from post-deployment mental health problems such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), co-morbidities with this and other mental health disorders are not unusual.45 Since the short and long term mental health impact of hazardous medical mission deployments has not been well characterized in volunteers, additional studies on this are warranted.",

While volunteering for a medical mission during a health crisis can be very rewarding, both professionally and personally, it can also be very disruptive and impactful. All volunteers for high risk missions must be made fully aware of the risks they are going to face and the potential consequences, which may include illness, quarantine, and even death. The challenges of delivering care under extremely constrained conditions may be overwhelming for some people, and it is imperative that volunteers have realistic expectations of conditions in the field as well as a good understanding of how this deployment may affect their lives \u2013 before, during and after deployment.",
