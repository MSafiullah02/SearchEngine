Rhinoviruses can infect ciliated cells in the nasal epithelium but may also infect other nasal cells. ICAM-1 is the receptor that most rhinovirus serotypes use to gain entrance into human cells (Greve et al., 1989). A minority of rhinovirus serotypes use the LDH receptor and one rhinovirus serotype uses sialoprotein. Rhinoviruses belong to the Picornavirus family and are closely related to the enteroviruses. In contrast to enterovirus, however, rhinovirus is killed by gastric acid and does not cause gastrointestinal infection in normal individuals. Laboratory detection of infectious rhinovirus has been performed in human fibroblast monolayer cultures for many years. Recently, more sensitive methods for detection of rhinovirus RNA utilizing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology have provided new perspectives toward understanding the epidemiology of rhinovirus infection, and the clinical implications continue to be developed.",

Crowded places such as nursery and day care centers, schools, and military camps are ideal settings for high transmission rates of rhinovirus among young adults and children. Rhinovirus infections occur throughout all seasons, but the infection rate of rhinovirus colds seems to vary during the year due to the prevalence of other more seasonal respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus accounts for up to 80% of colds during the fall season in temperate areas of the United States, but occur less frequently during the winter and spring months when influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza types I\u2013III, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus are also present. In tropical areas, the respiratory virus season coincides with the rainy season from May through November. Recent new epidemiologic data of rhinovirus infection determined by RT-PCR suggest that the relative number of rhinovirus infections over the year is fairly constant. It is interesting to note that the frequency of rhinovirus infections may not be a result of the effects of temperature or humidity on rhinovirus survival in nature, but rather that climate alters human behavior. One hypothesis suggests that minor climate changes, such as cooler air or rainy days, will keep people indoors and thereby increase the risk of rhinovirus transmission.",

The number of rhinovirus particles required to infect nonimmune individuals is low; indeed, a tissue culture infectious dose50 less than 10 can cause infection. Rhinovirus deposited in the conjunctiva reach the nose by way of the tear duct to cause infection in the nose. The eye is not infected following deposit of rhinovirus. Inoculation of rhinovirus into the oral mucosa does not cause infection of the oral or tonsillar mucosa. Saliva may occasionally contain a small amount of rhinovirus, probably from diluted nasopharyngeal secretions, but in general transmission by coughing, sneezing, kissing, or drinking from the same glass is not likely to occur in otherwise healthy individuals. On the other hand, transmission of rhinovirus in nasal mucus from a person with a cold to a susceptible individual is likely either by touching shared environmental objects or by direct hand-to-hand contact (handshakes, holding hands, or high fives) followed by self-inoculation with a contaminated finger into the nose or eye. Rhinovirus can survive on environmental surfaces for at least 4 days. Adults with colds commonly contaminate environmental surfaces during normal daily activities. An individual is most contagious during the first several days of the cold, when the concentration of rhinovirus in nasal secretions is highest. Rhinovirus infection may also play an important role in dispersal of bacteria, such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), especially among children.",

A recent study demonstrated that preschool-age children have approximately six rhinovirus infections per year. These infections are caused by different rhinovirus serotypes. Each serotype is thought to give lifelong immunity, but with at least 100 different rhinovirus serotypes, it is no wonder that colds are common. Rhinovirus replicate in the nasal cells for up to 3 weeks until the humoral neutralizing antibodies terminate the infection. Following rhinovirus infection, most individuals develop neutralizing antibodies of 1:16 dilution or greater, and are resistant to reinfection with the same serotype. Rhinovirus infection causes lysis of the infected cells and a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance. However, the nasal lining remains intact, as observed by light and scanning electron microscopy (Figure 1\n), because only a limited number of cells are infected at one time. The symptoms of a rhinovirus infection are thought to be caused by the host response to the rhinovirus infection (Hendley, 1998) due to an elaboration of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and the influx of a high number of polymorphonuclear cells.",

            "text": "Several inflammatory pathways, including neurologic reflexes triggered by the infection, have been identified as playing a role in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus symptoms. Increased kinin levels are found in nasal secretions during rhinovirus infection and may be responsible in part for sore throat symptoms and contribute to rhinorrhea due to plasma transudation (Proud et al., 1990). Kinins are also thought to release histamine from mast cells, although most studies have not demonstrated elevated levels of histamine in nasal secretions during colds. Inflammatory events that occur during rhinovirus infection include stimulation of pain, cough, and sneeze reflexes, vasodilation, transudation of plasma, and increased glandular output of secretions from goblet cells and seromucous glands. The parasympathetic tone is increased during the early phase of a cold, resulting in an increase of secretions from the anterior serous gland on the nasal mucosa. Several pro-inflammatory mediators are increased (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1, -6 and -8). IL-8 is a chemoattractant for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and results in an influx of PMNs on days 1 and 2 during rhinovirus infection. The number of PMNs increases about 100-fold in nasal secretions and has been found to correlate well with symptom expression. Colored nasal discharge (yellow or green) occurs in about 50% of adults and correlates with the increased number of PMNs, but bacteria have not been shown to increase in the nasopharynx during uncomplicated colds.",

Accurate determination of symptoms is a challenge in children because symptoms are reported second-hand by parents trying to interpret what their child may feel. Two studies have evaluated the expression of cold symptoms in children who were brought to the doctor. A recent study evaluated cold symptoms in normal school-age children who actively participated with the parent in recording their symptoms (Winther, 2002). Cough, nasal congestion, and runny nose were present in roughly 60% of school-age children and continued for more than 10 days in uncomplicated colds. Feverishness was reported in 15% during the early phase. Rhinovirus was detected in 46% of these reported colds, and one or more bacterial pathogens were isolated in 29%. Symptom profiles for rhinovirus illnesses versus those with bacteria isolated were not different. In adults, 60% of those with colds report sore throat, sneezing, nasal discharge and obstruction, while cough and malaise are reported in approximately 40%. Fever is rare in uncomplicated colds, and feverishness is reported in less than 10% of adults with colds. Most cold symptoms in adults have diminished by day 7, with sneezing, congestion, and runny nose reported in less than 20%, whereas cough is still reported as present in roughly 40%.",

The reason for this is unknown, but a similar trend has been found in children. Roughly 30% of children may have a rhinovirus infection without the signs or symptoms of a cold.

Approximately 40% of young children have changes in middle ear pressure prior to the time when the parent or caretaker realizes that the child has a cold (Moody et al., 1998).

It has recently been shown that nose blowing can generate intranasal pressure sufficient to propel nasal secretions into the sinus cavity. The majority of the abnormalities observed by CT scans during colds are likely due to accumulation of sinus secretions rather than mucosal swelling. Stagnant secretions in the sinuses may be due to blockage in the ostiomeatal complex, a narrow opening from the sinus to the nose, or it may be due to decreased ciliary clearance in the sinuses.",

Over several days, newly produced rhinovirus is excreted into the nasal mucus and may be distributed to other areas of upper respiratory mucosa. Adults seem more prone to paranasal sinus involvement, whereas young children seem more prone to otitis media during colds. The paranasal sinuses are not fully developed until about age 12, but other factors may also influence these differences. Children are not good nose blowers and thus may be less likely to spread rhinovirus into the sinuses. On the other hand, children spend more time asleep, and a horizontal position may facilitate the spread of mucus (and thus rhinovirus) into the middle ear cavity. Rhinovirus has been demonstrated in fluid obtained from the maxillary sinus/ear cavity of 40\u201350% of patients with acute sinusitis and otitis media (Pitkaranta et al., 1997, Pitkaranta et al., 1998). Multiple rhinovirus infections may cause hypertrophic adenoids (lymphatic glands in the posterior oropharynx) in children with blockage of the nasal passages, and consecutive rhinovirus infections in children without a wellness period in between may create a clinical picture simulating the chronic sinusitis seen in adults (chronic nasal discharge for more than 6 weeks).",
