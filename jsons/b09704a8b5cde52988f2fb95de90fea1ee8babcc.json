Twenty-five of the counting methods were introduced to support indicators that measure an object of study's contribution to, participation in, or production in a research endeavor. RQ 1.3 (ongoing research): The first of Gingras' three criteria is whether an indicator is an adequate proxy for its purpose. Some of the methods used to determine the adequacy of a counting method imply circularity, which is not recommended by Gingras (Gingras, 2014, pp. 113-114) . An example of a circularity is to compare scores obtained by the new counting method to scores obtained by an existing counting method (Stallings et al., 2013, p . 9681) 1 . Both counting methods build on publication counts. Instead, an independent and already accepted measure should be used (Gingras, 2014, pp. 113-114) , for example, validate the scores of the new counting method for Nobel laureates versus other researchers (Aziz & Rozing, 2013, pp. 4-6) 1 . A difference in scores is expected due to the prestige of the laureates. Opposite to the counting method, prestige is not based on publication counts.",

The indicator should reflect the changes over time in the object the indicator is designed to measure (Gingras, 2014, p. 115) . It is well-documented that co-authorship is the norm in most research fields and that the number of co-authors per publication is increasing over time (Henriksen, 2016; Lindsey, 1980, p. 152; Wuchty et al., 2007) . Thus, I assess how well the counting methods adapt to a change in the numbers of co-authors per publication. Some of the 29 counting methods have formulas that refer to surveys among researchers about co-author practice (Lukovits & Vinkler, 1995, p. 94) 1 . Eventually, these surveys may become obsolete due to changes in co-author practices and the counting method does not meet the sensitivity criteria.",

For such indicators it is not immediately visible whether a change in the score is due to a change in the publication count, citation count, or both (Gingras, 2014, p. 116) . Some of the 29 counting methods do mix publication and citation counts (Shen & Barabasi, 2014, pp. 12325-12327) 1 . Many build on publication counts alone but add other elements such as parameters chosen by the bibliometrician (Kim & Diesner, 2014, pp . 591-593) 1 or separate formulas for groups of publications (Abramo et al., 2013, p. 201) 1 .

These preliminary results indicate that the internal validation of counting methods is complex.",

Other studies have systematically analyzed a few counting methods using well-defined frameworks. In the present study, I do both. I identify 29 counting methods, which are categorized according to their properties and analyzed with regard to internal and external validation. This study has the potential to give a solid foundation for the use of and discussion about counting methods as well as encourages more analyses to develop our knowledge about counting methods.",

RQ 1.1 is useful to understand the magnitude and timeliness of the RQ. \uf0b7 RQ 1.2: To what extent can the counting methods introduced into the bibliometric literature be categorized according to general properties? Based on the overview provided through RQ 1.1, RQ 1.2 explores whether the counting methods share properties. \uf0b7 RQ 1.3: To what extent are the counting methods introduced into the bibliometric literature validated internally? RQ 1.2 focuses on the development of categories and thereby general descriptions of counting methods. RQ 1.3 adds information about how the counting methods are validated internally by the studies that introduced the counting methods. \uf0b7 RQ 1.4: How many of the counting methods introduced into the bibliometric literature are used in research evaluations and to what extent does the use in research evaluations -and thereby external validation -comply with the properties and internal validation of the counting methods? Whereas RQ 1.3 concentrates on the internal validation of the counting methods, RQ 1.4 investigates the external validation of the counting methods by how they are used in research evaluations. I investigate whether the intentions in the studies that introduced the counting methods (RQs 1.2 and 1.3) comply with the subsequent use of the counting methods.",
