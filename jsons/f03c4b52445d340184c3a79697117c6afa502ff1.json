In our practice, some asymptomatic patients with above average risk patients, e.g. those with a personal history of breast cancer, may be scheduled as a diagnostic exam. Some of these women do not wish to postpone their exam and are relieved to know that their mammogram was normal. Also, we continue to perform all percutaneous -US, tomosynthesis, and MRI-guided breast biopsies as well as non-wire localizations. Further, our radiologists are prioritizing the reviews of outside films to expedite biopsies and pre-surgical evaluations of cancers. There is a shift to non-wire localization when possible so that patients can be rapidly rescheduled as OR availability opens up.

After the stay at home order was put in place by the Governor, diagnostic studies have diminished due to patient preference to reschedule.

To practice \"social distancing\" as much as possible, radiologists (attendings and fellows) are divided into cohorts, so that one cohort of radiologists would work in the clinic contiguously for a set number of days, then stay home to perform non-clinical work for a set number of days, alternating with the other cohort, all the while maintaining clinical coverage and containing potential exposure. This reduction of clinic staffing at any one time is possible given the decrease in volume associated with the re-scheduling of non-essential exams. As much as possible, this \"cohort-assignment\" is coordinated with technologists schedule as well. Radiology residents are considered \"non-essential\" during this time (and hence not serving in the clinic). Interactions between radiologist and technologist are taking place via phone (rather than in-person) as much as possible, and any one radiologist would use the same reading station each clinical day.
