These findings are not specific and may be seen in many other conditions.\nPulmonary function tests (PFTs) show increased DLCO; however, often these patients cannot participate in such testing.Bronchoscopy with BAL is the confirmatory diagnostic method. BAL shows progressive bloody return. Cytology with Prussian blue staining should show > 20 % hemosiderin-laden macrophages. This test is limited if alveolar hemorrhage occurred < 48\u201372 h before the procedure, as duration of time may be too short for red blood cells (RBC) phagocytosis by pulmonary macrophages.\nPathogenesis of DAHThere is no clear etiology for DAH post-HSCT. The development of DAH around the engraftment period suggests an inflammatory cascade involving the alveoli. Pre-HSCT conditioning regimens (including total body irradiation (TBI)) may initiate the inflammatory process.ManagementPatients with suspected DAH should be transferred to the medical intensive care unit, given that respiratory failure may develop rapidly. Some patients require high-flow oxygen and subsequent mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Supportive management and high-dose systemic steroids are the key elements of DAH treatment.\nMechanical ventilation should be tailored to each individual, reflecting the ARDS mechanical ventilation protocol/low tidal volume for management of acute lung injury. This practice has not been validated in DAH, but the pathological pattern of DAH is similar to acute lung injury/ARDS. Similarly, prone positioning may be of benefit in refractory cases.Immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose corticosteroids is the mainstay of therapy based on case reports and retrospective series. Doses of up to 1 g of methylprednisolone daily divided into 2\u20134 doses should be given daily for 3\u20135 days, followed by a slow taper over 1\u20133 months. Alternate dosing schedules have been suggested, beginning at 2 mg/kg daily in divided doses, tapering over a 2-month period.Correction of underlying coagulopathy by maintaining platelet count > 50,000/mm3 and INR < 2.BAL to rule out a concomitant infectious pathogen.Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven\u00ae) has been used; however, no benefit has been demonstrated.Aminocaproic acid (Amicar\u00ae) has been used less frequently with limited supporting data.\n\n",

Occasionally, chest X-ray does not show obvious infiltrates and CT scan of the chest is warranted. The criteria for diagnosis of IPS proposed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 1993 include:\nRadiologic imaging evidence of multilobar diffuse alveolar infiltrates.Hypoxia or elevated alveolar\u2013arterial gradient.Negative BAL for blood and cultures for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens.Negative infectious studies from the blood, specifically for CMV.\nPathogenesis of IPSEvaluation of BAL fluid from IPS patients shows elevated inflammatory cytokine markers compared to negative or healthy controls. IPS is likely a complex cytotoxic and immune-mediated attack of the lung.Management\nCorticosteroids should be started early in the disease course. Historically, patients who developed IPS around engraftment responded better to steroids. A reasonable starting dose is 2 mg/kg daily of methylprednisolone (or equivalent) for the first week followed by a slow taper over the course of 2\u20133 months.PCP and fungal prophylaxis are recommended.Etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae) 25 mg SQ twice weekly for 8 weeks has been used in conjunction with corticosteroids; however in small case series, no additional benefit was seen when compared with placebo.\n\n",

To make the diagnosis of BOS, these four criteria must be present along with active chronic GVHD in at least one organ other than the lung:\nFEV1 < 75 % of predicted normalEvidence of airway obstruction with a ratio of FEV1/FVC < 0.7Expiratory high-resolution chest CT that reveals air trapping, small airway thickening, or bronchiectasis or RV > 120 % of predicted normalAbsence of active infection or pathologic confirmation\ni.Lung biopsy typically shows cicatricial bronchial obliterans (i.e., obliteration of airways by dense fibrous scar tissues)\n\n3.Clinical findingsInsidious course manifested by nonproductive cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Early in BOS, pulmonary exam may be normal; however, later stages are manifested by wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase, and inspiratory crackles.4.Diagnostic tests\nChest imaging should be carried out in all patients undergoing workup for BOS. Chest X-rays may be normal early in BOS. As the disease progresses, hyperinflation may be present.High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is more specific (see Fig. 22.2). Inspiratory and expiratory phases should be included to evaluate for air trapping or \u201cmosaic lung appearance\u201d which indicates regional airflow obstruction during the expiratory phase.\nPFTs are obtained as part of every patient\u2019s pre-HSCT baseline evaluation.\ni.The definition of airflow obstruction includes FEV1 < 75 %, FEV1/FVC < 0.70, or a decline in FEV1 > 10 % in 1 year.ii.Also noted is air trapping or increased RV and RV to total lung capacity (RV:TLC) ratio.iii.DLCO is not expected to be reduced but is often low pre-transplant and/or after induction chemotherapy .\nBronchoscopy is not routinely performed during the workup of BOS unless imaging is suspicious for an infectious process.Transbronchial biopsy is often nondiagnostic as the disease process is patchy.Surgical lung biopsy has higher chance of demonstrating constrictive bronchiolitis, the pathology seen in BOS.\ni.With the introduction of HRCT, surgical lung biopsy is often not required to confirm a diagnosis of BOS.\n\n5.Pathogenesis of BOSBOS may be a manifestation of primarily chronic GVHD with the etiology related to recognition of disparate antigens present in the context of HLA class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. It begins with fibroproliferative disease of the small airways, which results in inflammation, epithelial metaplasia, and denudification. Submucosal/mucosal fibrosis then develops, resulting in obliteration of the airways. Allogenic inflammatory conditions such as viral infections may also contribute to the development of BOS.6.ManagementManagement of BOS mainly involves intensifying immunosuppressive therapy and supportive care. There are no specific recommendations associated with treatment of BOS. The management of BOS mimics that of chronic GVHD.\nResponse to bronchodilators is often minimal but nevertheless should be considered because of presence of airflow obstruction.Corticosteroids 1\u20131.5 mg/kg prednisone per day for 2\u20136 weeks, then tapered over 6\u201312 months if there is a response. This regimen is based on case series and expert opinions.Other immunosuppressive medications maybe effective as steroid-sparing agents, including calcineurin inhibitors . Tacrolimus may reduce the incidence of BOS as compared to cyclosporine.Macrolides have been used post-transplant to prevent BOS. Small case series have reported stabilization of FEV1. Azithromycin 250 mgpo three times each week is a suggested regimen.Leukotrienes have been reported to be elevated in BAL fluid of patients with BOS. Trials of montelukast (Singulair\u00ae), a leukotriene inhibitor, are underway.A small phase II trial etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae) in patients with subacute lung injury showed improvement in lung function with a 5-year overall survival of 67 %, and 90 % in patients who responded to therapy.Patients should be assessed for oxygen needs using 6-min walk test and/or nocturnal O2 monitor study.Echocardiogram can screen for pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction, both accompanied by dyspnea.Lung transplant may be considered for very selected patients with severe respiratory impairment.\n\n",
