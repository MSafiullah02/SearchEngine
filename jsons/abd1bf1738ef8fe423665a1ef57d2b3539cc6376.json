The treatment of patients with rectal cancer requires both a multidisciplinary approach and a significant amount of resources. It is therefore imperative to rethink how rectal cancer treatment can be aligned with the current COVID-19 pandemic paradigms.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, anecdotal reports and our own experience suggested disastrous complications in patients not recognized to have coronavirus who underwent seemingly routine operations. 1 Yet while the possibility of occult asymptomatic COVID-19 is a threat, the inability to receive necessary treatments in the course of routine cancer care puts patients at increased risk for cancer-related morbi di ty and complications. 2 It is therefore appropriate that rectal cancer care algorithms be rethought and recommendations adjusted in the setting of this pandemic. During these challenging times, a broader lens must be employed with careful attention to patient safety, caregiver safety, and resource utilization. In this review, we explore the resources necessary for the care of patients with rectal cancer and discuss recommendations for safely modifying rectal cancer treatment plans during this unprecedented time.",

Cancer patients were not only more likely to be infected but also suffered a more severe course, with an increased incidence of intensive care resource utilization, invasive ventilation, and mortality. While the data is still evolving, recent surgery (within 1 month of infection) appears to put cancer patients at even higher risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality, with 75% of patients suffering a severe course of COVID-19. Importantly, this increased morbidity may occur in asymptomatic patients, who were not known to be coronavirus carriers. Given that widespread coronavirus testing is limited and that the sensitivity in patients without symptoms remains poor, every rectal cancer patient must be assumed to be an asymptomatic carrier. 1 The Surgical Treatment of Rectal Cancer Requires Utilization of Critical Hospital Resources",

These procedures are generally much less resource-intensive than TME as they are typically performed on an outpatient basis and often without the need for general anesthesia. Patients with high-risk features (depth of submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and location in the lower third of the rectum) may undergo completion TME at a time considered safe from a COVID-19 perspective, or alternatively offered adjuvant chemoradiotherapy if they are unwilling to pursue TME. 18, 19 If operating room resources are such that there is a long delay to TME, such patients should be recommended chemoradiotherapy. Patients with low-risk T1 cancer may not require any further therapy. Patients with T2 rectal cancer have a 20-30% risk of lymph node metastasis and are thus typically recommended to undergo TME, given that local excision results in a 30-40% risk of recurrence. 20, 21 Stage II or III Patients with locally advanced, T3-T4 or N+ disease, are most often recommended a multimodality treatment approach, consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. 19 But similar oncologic outcomes can be achieved with numerous alternative treatment combinations.

While proponents of long-course radiotherapy promote its greater effects in terms of rectal tumor regression, multiple studies have demonstrated equivalence between short-course (25 Gy in 5 fractions once daily for 5 days) and long-course (1.8-2-Gy fractions 5 days per week for 5 weeks) radiation in terms of local control and disease-free survival. 22, 23 While oncologically similar, shortcourse therapy results in dramatically fewer encounters for patients (25 visits for long course versus 5 visits for short course), lowering risk of coronavirus exposure for both patients and clinicians. Furthermore, more patients may be treated if each patient requires fewer sessions. Therefore, shortcourse neoadjuvant radiotherapy is appropriately recommended. 24 Surgical dogma has often suggested that proctectomy should be performed 4-8 weeks following long-course radiotherapy and 1 week following short-course radiotherapy. However, recent analysis of the multicenter randomized Stockholm III trial demonstrated a better rate of pathologic complete response in patients treated with short-course radiotherapy with a 4-8-week delay before TME, than among those treated with traditional short course (followed by immediate surgery) or long course (followed by surgery 4-8 weeks later). 25 Therefore, delaying surgery up to 8 weeks following short-course radiotherapy appears safe and may be recommended during the current COVID-19 pandemic. If longcourse radiotherapy is chosen (or for patients currently in treatment), a delay of more than 8-10 weeks after completion of radiotherapy may result in worse outcomes. In the multicenter randomized GRECCAR-6 study, a delay beyond 11 weeks increased surgical morbidity and resulted in compromised surgical margins (complete TME 78.7% versus 90%; p = 0.0156) without increasing the pathologic complete response rate. 26, 27 Therefore, if long-course radiotherapy is in the treatment regimen, surgery is best not delayed past 8 weeks if possible.",

In the RAPIDO trial, patients were randomized to total neoadjuvant therapy consisting of shortcourse radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery versus neoadjuvant long-course radiation followed by surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Authors noted that all patients in the TNT arm received radiation and 84% of patients were able to complete at least 75% of the prescribed chemotherapy, compared with 94% completing radiation and only 57% completing recommended chemotherapy in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm. Forty-eight percent of patients in the TNT arm suffered treatment-related toxicity, versus 25% in the long-course arm. However, there was no difference in the surgical procedures performed or in perioperative morbidity between the two arms. Thus, it appears that TNT is a safe option for the optimal delivery of recommended therapies for rectal cancer. 30 Perhaps the most relevant trial is the Timing of Rectal Cancer Response to Chemoradiation Consortium trial, in which neoadjuvant radiotherapy was administered, followed by 0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6). 31 Authors found that a longer duration of chemotherapy achieved greater rates of pathologic complete response, but unlike the findings in the GRECCAR-6 study, increased time after radiation was not associated with surgical complications. One theory is that chemotherapy may suppress the inflammatory response which otherwise results within a few weeks after radiotherapy. While TNT appears safe and will delay surgery by over 4 months, this must be balanced by the fact that patients must travel to infusion centers biweekly for 3-4 months, potentially increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19.",

Patients who upon re-staging have not demonstrated a tumor response are unlikely to benefit from further delay and surgery is indicated. Meanwhile, patients with a considerable but incomplete response may benefit from a 10-12-week delay as they may ultimately demonstrate a complete or near-complete response. 32, 33 Patients who have a complete clinical response may be offered resection, or can be entered into a \"watch and wait\" trial protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02008656). 34, 35 Results thus far are promising, with a local recurrence rate of about 25% at 2 years, compared with rates of 10% or less after TME; patients with local recurrence are able to undergo curative salvage surgery. We recommend that patients with evidence of clinically complete response be considered for a \"watch and wait\" protocol and followed closely by physical exam, endoscopy, and imaging. When deciding how to proceed following a near-complete or complete response, it must be emphasized that \"watch and wait\" as a treatment modality is still unproven, is not considered standard of care, and should only be offered by providers who are familiar with the stringent surveillance regimen that is required to detect an early recurrence.",

If surgery is essential, either open or laparoscopic or robotic surgery may be considered based upon surgeon comfort and expertise. 6 Providers should take all possible precautions to prevent inadvertently exposing caregivers. These include minimizing the use of energy devices; using closed-circuit smoke evacuation devices; wearing enhanced PPE; and, during laparoscopy, insufflating to lower pressures and desufflating the abdomen with a closed smoke evacuation system. Postoperative patient encounters should be minimized and telehealth, virtual visits, or telephone calls should be used as much as possible. Additionally, earlier and more frequent postoperative virtual visits should be performed which would likely capture early complications, preventing emergency room visits and readmissions. Hospitals with experience and capacity for mobile application follow-up should utilize these resources to maximize virtual patient contact. 36, 37 Looking Ahead As our ability to test patients improves, it may be prudent to test all patients preoperatively and consider delaying surgery for any asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus to prevent inadvertently triggering occult disease postoperatively. Of course, our abilities to test for either active disease or immunity are quickly evolving, and available resources should be assessed regularly.",
