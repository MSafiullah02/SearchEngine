Stockpiling of oseltamivir and, to a lesser extent, zanamivir has been advocated in the context of pandemic preparedness (Sch\u00fcnemann et al., 2007), yet the recent isolation of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza virus mutants, even from untreated patients, warrants for continued caution (Lackenby et al., 2008, Van der Vries et al., 2008). Additional anti-influenza virus compounds should be urgently developed, having a novel antiviral target that is highly conserved amongst influenza virus (sub)types and, hence, less prone to genetic variation and resistance selection.",

            "text": "One of the attractive therapeutic strategies would be a blockade of the viral entry into the host cell. The cellular entry process of influenza viruses has been unraveled since many years (reviewed in Skehel and Wiley, 2000). A key role is being played by the viral envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which contains the receptor-binding site for initial attachment to the sialylated cellular receptors, and governs the receptor specificity of human versus avian influenza virus subtypes (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008, Nicholls et al., 2008). In addition, after cellular uptake of the virus by endocytosis, the HA mediates the low pH-induced fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, leading to release of the viral ribonucleoprotein in the cytosol. Although the HA has been extensively studied from a biochemical and epidemiological perspective, specific antiviral drugs blocking the HA-receptor interaction remain to be clinically developed. Several reports are available on the in vitro activity of small-molecule inhibitors of influenza virus fusion, which act by preventing the conformational change of the HA at low pH (Russell et al., 2008, Deshpande et al., 2001, Plotch et al., 1999). Unfortunately, their development has been slow due to their inferior activity against some human influenza virus (sub)types, rapid selection for resistance and/or unsatisfactory outcome in animal models (Yagi et al., 1999).",

Remarkably, some of these lipophilic glycopeptide compounds were found to have inhibitory activity against coronaviruses and HIV, the latter being ascribed to inhibition of the HIV entry process (Balzarini et al., 2003, Balzarini et al., 2006, Preobrazhenskaya and Olsufyeva, 2006).

It has been shown that introduction of hydrophobic substituents into glycopeptide antibiotics enhances their activity against glycopeptide-resistant bacteria (Cooper et al., 1996, Printsevskaya et al., 2002, Pace and Yang, 2006), but, unfortunately, these products have lower water-solubility. To improve solubility, the squaric acid amide ester 5 was reacted (Sztaricskai et al., 2007b) with d-glucosamine (6i) or d-galactosamine (6j), resulting in the asymmetric squaric diamides 8i and 8j, respectively. In these products, the carbohydrate moiety is linked to the aglycone in an unusual manner, i.e. through a cyclobutandione moiety, and not directly through one of the hydroxyl groups, as in the parent glycopeptide antibiotics.",

Their activity was 2- to 5-fold higher than that of the squaric acid amide ester of aglycoristocetin 5 (EC50: 2.4 \u03bcM; SI: 42). An intermediate activity (EC50: 5 \u03bcM) was observed for the triglycyl derivative 8b1 which, surprisingly, was comparably active as unsubstituted aglycoristocetin 2. The 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl derivative 8c and the d-galactosamine derivative 8j were active against two of the three influenza virus strains tested, and the derivatives containing carboxypentyl (8b) and d-glucosamine (8i) substituents had activity against only one virus strain. The compounds carrying 4-aminophenylpiperidine (8d), terphenyl (8g) and anthracene (8h) substituents were completely inactive. Thus, the intrinsic anti-influenza virus activity of aglycoristocetin is markedly increased by squaric acid amide coupling and addition of a hydrophobic side chain, with the phenylbenzyl group being the optimal substituent. The favorable effect of this side chain appears to depend on different factors, namely: neutral charge (the alcoholic aliphatic derivative 8a is clearly more active than the corresponding carboxypentyl compound 8b) and steric bulkiness (8e and 8f are active while the more bulky compounds 8g and 8h are not).",

A detailed analysis is currently ongoing to determine the effect of 8e on the virus-receptor interaction (i.e. binding of the viral HA to the sialic acid terminus of cell surface glycans), endocytosis or membrane fusion (i.e. fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane). Whatever the precise mode of action, the subtype-independent activity of 8e provides strong support that the interaction site of 8e is highly conserved amongst human influenza virus strains. This is consistent with our observation that influenza virus fully retained its sensitivity to 8e after eleven sequential virus passages in MDCK cells in the presence of 8e (at concentrations up to 25 \u03bcM). Within human influenza virus HA sequences, only few residues are fully conserved, in particular in the receptor-binding site and fusion peptide (Skehel and Wiley, 2000).",
