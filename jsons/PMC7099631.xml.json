This big Brazilian Amazonian state presents different risk of infection and transmission among different regions and cities [29]. Some patients were infected in their home cities whereas others while traveling to endemic regions. All subjects were diagnosed and treated in Bel\u00e9m at the Evandro Chagas Institute between 2007 and 2009. Sample and collection procedures were previously described [17]. Briefly, patients were clinically examined and received the standard treatment of 1500 mg of CQ associated with 210 mg of PQ in short regimen during a week (first day CQ 600 mg and PQ 30 mg, second and third days CQ 450 mg and PQ 30 mg, and last 4 days PQ 30 mg) as recommended by the Brazilian health authorities [30]. During the week treatment, patient response was daily accompanied by clinical examinations. Parasitemia and gametocytemia were daily estimated (density per microliter of blood by counting the number of parasites per 100 fields and double-checked blindly by two expert microscopists). Parasite counts were obtained before treatment and in the next 7 days of treatment. All subjects provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. Participants younger than 18 years (n = 17) had the informed consents signed by parents to participate in the study. The Ethics Committees of the Evandro Chagas Institute and Federal University of Par\u00e1 approved the study protocol (CEP/IEC-0035 and CEP-CCS/UFPA 061/07).",

Haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium were estimated with PHASE 2.1.1 [32]. The individual proportions of European, African and Amerindian genetic ancestry from the study population were estimated as previously described [33]. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) is a repeated measure analysis focused on average changes in response over time and the impact of covariates on these changes. This method models the mean response as a linear function of covariates of interest via transformation or link function and can be used in studies in which data are asymmetric or the data distribution is difficult to verify due to small sample size [34]. This analysis was performed to determine the genetic influence in parasitemia or gametocytemia clearance by treatment over time considering a Gaussian distribution with an identity link function and an exchangeable correlation matrix structure. Parasitemia and gametocytemia levels were log-transformed before analysis due to their skewed distribution, but back-transformed values are presented in the results as geometric means. Age, gender, co-medication, parasitemia baseline level, gametocytemia baseline level and African and Amerindian genetic ancestry entered in models as covariates based on conceptual analyses of the literature and/or by means of a statistical definition (association with the study factor and with the outcome at p \u2264 0.15). Based on previous investigations with the same sample, CYP2C8 genotypes were also used as a covariate in the gametocytemia analyses [17]. GEE analysis was performed with the SPSS18.0 (IBM Company, NY, USA) statistical package for Windows\u00ae. Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure (false discovery rate [FDR]) for multiple comparisons was performed to control for multiple testing and corrected p-values were presented. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p-value <0.05. To determine the effect sizes, Cohen's d test was calculated based on standardized differences between means [35].",

Due to intrinsic biological dissimilarities, extrapolation from P. falciparum may not reflect the true drug resistance mechanisms of P. vivax, thus limiting the number of parasite markers definitively identified in P. vivax [42]. Although how the interactions among CQ and PQ with OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP2B1 occur is not fully understood, the results of the present study suggest that polymorphisms in these transporters should alter the availability of both drugs in different tissues interfering with their action in a specific manner affecting the different sexual forms of P. vivax.

The present results showed that ABCB1 T/nonG/T haplotype carriers (3435C>T, 2677G>A/T and 1236C>T) showed a lower parasitemia clearance rate over treatment time when compared with wild-type haplotype CGC homozygotes; however, after the FDR procedure, this difference was no longer statistically significant.

First, we had no internal control to correct for any effect of time (e.g., regression to the mean) or expectancy bias because we did not have a placebo arm in this trial. Second, we did not control for parasite resistance. Nevertheless, CQ-resistant P. vivax has been estimated to vary from 4.4 to 10% in the Amazonian region [62] and all patients presented negative results after treatment. The role of transporter gene variability is associated with the rate of clearance and not with efficacy per se. Although it is not possible to exclude that the effects we observed were due to lack of adherence to treatment, there is no reason to expect a preferential compliance to CQ/PQ treatment according to transporter gene genotypes. This study design also did not allow to evaluate PQ effect in liver hypnozoites, or to evaluate the effect of transporter genes in relapses occurrence.",
