This approach represents a step-change in thinking. But as we are urged toward collective action,2 is it time to rethink our approach to research, especially in relation to climate change and infectious disease?",

In this approach, understanding the absence of a disease might be as important as identifying the specific factors driving disease emergence and transmission. Explorations of the collective disease burden across species might better explain the role and interaction of climate than the current focus on specific drivers and individual diseases. In this approach, assessments of risk, vulnerabilities, and interactions across these collective versus absent disease states could begin to forge a wider understanding of the role and effect (both present and future) of climate change on disease.",
