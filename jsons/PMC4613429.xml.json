The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Africa had eclipsed the news about this new virus. Now it is emerging from shadows of Ebola, and its potential to become a global health threat is being discussed. The virus was first isolated from a patient who died from severe respiratory illness in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and reported in June 20121. The new virus belongs to family of coronaviruses. It was named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), after its appearance in that Region.",

Severe cases may go into respiratory and/or other organs like kidney failure, requiring admission in ICU. About a third of patients complain of vomiting and diarrhoea. If untreated, one in three patients dies within 10-12 days from the onset of symptoms5. Symptoms are more severe in those who are immune-compromised, elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions like diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease. Not all who get infected develop full blown pneumonia, some have only mild flu-like symptoms or no symptomsat all6.
