Our patient was a young woman without any accompanying disease. She appeared to have more favorable prognostic factors compared with the patients presented in the previous reports. The only possible negative prognostic factor for our patient was her high neutrophil\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

However, large\u2010scale studies are needed to define or confirm the risk factors for the prognosis of COVID\u201019 in transplant patients. Patients who are immunocompromised can present with an atypical form of the disease. Hence, all transplant patients presenting with any respiratory tract signs or symptoms, even in very mild forms, or with high fever should be tested for COVID\u201019. Oligosymptomatic organ recipients as possible carriers can likewise be extremely dangerous for other transplant patients, they meet in transplant centers.
