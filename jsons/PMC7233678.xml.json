            "text": "As of 28th April 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 2.9 million worldwide, and the number of deaths due to the disease reached 200,000 [1]. In Sweden, diagnosed COVID-19 cases surpassed 18,000 and related deaths reached 2200 at the same date. Guidelines from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals aged 70 years and older or with an underlying medical condition such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, cancer, chronic obstructive pneumatic/pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and diabetes, are considered to be at high risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19, requiring in-hospital care [1, 2]. These recommendations are mainly based on studies from China and Italy, and generally show that once infected, individuals with at least one of these prognostic factors are more likely to generate severe disease, requiring hospitalization and a resulting higher risk of mortality [3\u20138]. Governments around the world have, therefore, recommended that individuals with at least one of these factors self-isolate for prolonged periods of time to not only reduce the risk contracting severe COVID-19, but also prevent any sudden increase in demand for critical care in hospitals, which could overwhelm health systems. If the pandemic developed to affect a large proportion of the population, then critical care capacity could become saturated. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 are to a large extent unknown in many countries. Knowledge of the distribution of individuals considered to be at high risk of severe COVID-19, coupled with the capacity of the health care system, would allow clear strategic planning.",

Many of these models are based on the assumption that disease severity increases with age, but they do not account for an increased risk of severe disease in individuals with underlying medical conditions. This is usually because age stratified burden of disease at a local level is rarely available. Even when this information is available, data from which it originates can be obtained from a sample of the population rather than from the whole population. If the sample is not representative of the population at large, results may be biased. In order to build clear robust models that will provide trustworthy estimates of the extent to which the infection will impact populations, we need reliable estimates on the underlying prevalence of medical conditions suggesting high risk of severe disease.",

However, previous studies suggest the specificity and sensitivity of diagnoses of specific cardiovascular diagnoses such as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and atrial fibrillation from the National Patient Registers are high [14]. The National Cancer Register reported that there were 214,000 individual tumors reported in 3 years prior to 31st December 2016, while we report 129, 155 individuals in our study population with at least one tumor in 3 years prior to 1st January 2016 [19]. The prevalence of COPD is estimated at around 4\u201310% in Sweden, which is higher than the 0.8% we calculated. However, only 30% of COPD cases are diagnosed by healthcare professionals, which are often the most severe cases. The low observed prevalence of COPD in our study may therefore be due to us only capturing severe disease that is recorded in the Patient Register, and we were unable to capture moderate and mild COPD diagnosed and treated exclusively in primary care [20\u201322]. We have also underestimated the prevalence of asthma in Sweden, which is known to be between 8 and 10%, as we were only able to identify severe cases that required hospital admission [14, 23, 24]. However, more severe asthma is likely to exacerbate more severe COVID-19, meaning we have identified those at the greatest risk. Finally, a study calculated a diabetes prevalence of 4.6% in Stockholm using survey data from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, which is slightly higher than our estimate of 4.0% [25]. However, a report from the National Diabetes Register suggests that 22.6% of diabetes cases do not require pharmaceutical therapies, and only can be identified from primary care or quality registers, for which we did not have access [26, 27].",

The Prescribed Drug Register could identify individuals with hypertension or high blood pressure as it includes information on individuals that dispensed a medication regularly used to treat these conditions (diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors etc.) [29]. However, the data we had available from the Prescribed Drug Register did not include information on these medications. Given hypertension and high blood pressure are precursors of clinical cardiovascular disease, it is likely that those with the most severe disease are captured in our cardiovascular disease estimates. Furthermore, other health agencies around the world (Center for Disease Control, United States; National Health Service, United Kingdom) have suggested additional prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, immunosuppression, and severe obesity. We decided to ground our choice of prognostic factors on recommendations from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to give an overview of factors deemed important by multinational organizations, and as these are likely the guidelines that individuals in Sweden and Europe are currently following.",

Our raw measure of cumulative number of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 may therefore not represent those at the highest risk if one factor contributes more to severe disease in comparison with the others. Data from the World Health organization-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease suggest that the case-fatality is highest in those with cardiovascular disease (13.2%) compared with cancer (7.6%), chronic respiratory disease (8.0%), diabetes (9.2%), and those with no comorbid conditions (1.4%) [30]. If this is similar in all populations, then the individual prevalence of each of the prognostic factors at national and county level in Sweden that we have also presented may give better information of the populations at highest risk of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, the current definitions of what constitutes a prognostic factor are broad. It is likely that severe forms of cardiovascular disease (e.g. acute myocardial infarction) contribute more to risk of severe COVID-19 compared with less severe cardiovascular disease (e.g. stable angina). As current evidence is scarce, we need a better understanding of the specific conditions that contribute to a poorer prognosis of COVID-19.",

We have also presented the same analyses when the look back period is changed to 1, 5 and 10 years. The primary look back period was defined as 3 years due to being a reasonable time frame to capture individuals with active disease. We believe this gives an accurate overview of the burden of disease in the population for all diseases apart from cancer. It has been suggested that only those with active cancer are truly at a high risk of severe COVID-19, and a definition of active cancer can take many forms [31]. For some types of cancer, 3 years can be considered a long time after cancer diagnosis, and if the individual has survived, it is likely they will be considered to no longer have active cancer at 3 years after diagnosis. Therefore, for cancer, the analysis with a 1 year look back period may be a better estimation of individuals with active disease. Furthermore, all calculations require just one occurrence of a diagnosis to be counted as a confirmed condition. It is possible to increase confidence that an individual has been truly diagnosed with certain specific conditions by requiring more than one record indicating that diagnosis. However, this is highly disease specific and would require further breakdown into the conditions that require more than one record of diagnosis to confirm disease, which is out of the scope of the current project.",
