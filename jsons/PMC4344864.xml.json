            "text": "Viral metagenomics characterizes the genetic composition of viral particles enriched from environmental or biological samples. Because of low viral nucleic acid concentrations, genetic characterization first requires non-specific nucleic acid amplification followed by DNA sequencing. Sequencing can be performed by plasmid subcloning and Sanger sequencing or using highly parallel sequencing technologies also known as next generation or deep sequencing (Allander et al., 2001, Capobianchi et al., 2013, Delwart, 2007, Delwart, 2013, Mokili et al., 2012, Tang and Chiu, 2010). Viral metagenomics or sequencing of nucleic acids from enriched viral particle preparations has been frequently applied for viral discovery (Chiu, 2013, Delwart, 2012, Lipkin and Firth, 2013), resulting in the genetic characterization of numerous human and animal viruses (Allander et al., 2005, Allander et al., 2007, De Vlaminck et al., 2013, Grard et al., 2012, Handley et al., 2012, Kapoor et al., 2009, Kapoor et al., 2013, Li et al., 2009, Li et al., 2011, Li et al., 2013a, Li et al., 2013b, Quan et al., 2010, Wylie et al., 2012) but its non-specific nature also endows it with potential as a universal virus detection assay. Viral metagenomics can also be used for detection of contaminating viruses in biological products such as human and animal vaccines (Farsang and Kulcsar, 2012, McClenahan et al., 2011, McClenahan et al., 2014, Onions et al., 2011, Victoria et al., 2010). The mutation profile and genetic stability of attenuated vaccine viruses such as oral polio vaccine and influenza vaccines can also be tracked by deep sequencing (Bidzhieva et al., 2014, Neverov and Chumakov, 2010).",

In this study, the impact of four steps used in viral metagenomic library preparations on the detection of different viruses and percentage of genome coverage were compared. A laboratory assembled biological reagent consisting of a mixture of 25 human viral pathogens was employed. This biological reagent, an important resource for the future comparisons of different viral detection methods, includes large and small viral particles with DNA or RNA viral genomes originating from cell culture supernatants or biological samples. The methodological steps compared were physical and enzymatic enrichment of viral particle-associated nucleic acids using filtration and nuclease digestion, nucleic acid extraction techniques, random RT-PCR pre-amplification, and different Illumina library preparation methods.",

The result with the NIBSC reagent may be due the possible retention of viruses or virus aggregate on the 0.45 \u03bcm filters or the release of nuclease-sensitive viral nucleic acids from virions in the reagent solution. Unlike the sample analyzed in this study, the use of filtration and nuclease treatment are considered useful to reduce background of host and bacterial DNA from biologically more complex clinical samples such as tissue, plasma, feces, and respiratory secretions (Allander et al., 2001, Delwart, 2007). The lower efficiency of the Trizol extraction method may be due to the loss of nucleic acids during the interphase collection and precipitation steps. The silica columns yielded the best results despite the known release of background nucleic acids from these columns (Lysholm et al., 2012, Naccache et al., 2013, Naccache et al., 2014). Pre-amplification, while increasing the number of viral reads actually decreased genome coverage and number of viruses detected. This observation is due to the generation of many similar reads over the same limited genome region reducing overall coverage. Thus, non-specific pre-amplification (prior to the PCR required to incorporate Illumina primers) is best avoided when the input DNA (from the initial RT and Klenow steps) is in sufficient quantity for direct library preparation using Illumina kits. Lastly the use of the ScriptSeq kits detected more viruses with greater genome coverage than the Nextera and TruSeq kits despite generating fewer viral reads. This result may also reflect the fewer PCR cycles used in the use of the TruSeq kit resulting in fewer duplicate reads covering the same genome region. The maximum number of viruses detected was 20 out of 25 (N225 and N226) when analyzing a normalized 150,000 reads or 22/25 (N226) viruses when all \u223c2 million usable reads were included (three and four reads for IFN A H3N2 and PIV3 respectively were detected with the complete dataset).",

It was shown that deep sequencing detected H1N1 at titers near the detection limit of specific RT-PCR particularly when samples were first treated with DNase prior to extraction, and the percentage of sequence reads was correlated with virus titer (Greninger et al., 2010). Here, all viruses quantifiable by qPCR with Ct <37 as well as 4 of the 6 viruses not detectable by qPCR were detected by deep sequencing. This result indicates that deep sequencing is a highly sensitive method with the added advantage of simultaneously detecting all known viruses. Further studies will be required to compare the sensitivity of viral metagenomics to that of highly optimized clinical PCRs. The sensitivity of viral metagenomics for any specific virus target will also be affected by the quantity of other remaining nucleic acids, both non-viral and from other viruses, which may vary widely between clinical samples.",
