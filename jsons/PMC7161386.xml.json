            "text": "The circumstance might be minor, requiring brief intervention. Or it could be a situation requiring the creation of new managerial protocols. That is, a program needs to be developed. The identification of these situations, their analysis after fact-finding, the organizing of an appropriate program, the appointing of a deputy to operate the new program, and its supervision and constant improvement are reasonable expectations. Three skills reflect the core competencies executive management expects from the senior security personnel:1.\nInitiating new programs. Organizations are never static. New issues require fresh responses. Assume that in 5 or 7 years the organization will be considerably different than it is today. Security management programs change in parallel with other activities in the workplace.2.\nOperating existing programs. The ability to initiate a successful program is a strategic skill, whereas the operation of existing programs is less challenging. Nonetheless, this is the basis of most daily work and includes opportunities for creativity and constant program improvement, much as what occurs in the initiating of such activities. Another core skill is the ability to collect information that is critical to the operation and assess the success of ongoing programs (see Box 2.1\n). The manager or director for such operations normally manages the budget for these activities (see Chapter 8).Box 2.1Collecting and measuring what\u2019s importantOnce goals are set, data are needed to evaluate how successfully aims are being reached. Relevant data collection can also point to other issues that require more attention than what was initially apparent. Managers believe that data \u2013 the metrics \u2013 are indispensable in creating a sensible program. Much of the burden of collecting systems inputs can be collected through automated systems. The data can then be analyzed, sometimes with the use of computer programs that can produce extensive reports, nuanced to the issues that are important. Analysis is improved. This is partially why security operations have provided greater measurable value over the years. Criminal incidents must be collected for legal and risk management purposes and also so that they can be measured for any relevant trend. Services performed by security personnel may be collected and measured for the same reasons. The following reflects the information a security department might collect to assess programmatic developments.\nNumber of criminal incidents, including:\n\u2022Robbery\u2022Aggravated assault\u2022Other assault\u2022Burglary\u2022Larceny (theft): employee\u2022Larceny: nonemployee\u2022Motor vehicle theft\u2022Forgery and counterfeiting\u2022Fraud and embezzlement within the facilities\u2022Vandalism on or near property\u2022Trespassing\u2022Other\n\nNetwork interfaces (computer crime), including:\n\u2022Virus and worm incidents\u2022Computer system crashes (utilities problems)\u2022Flooding or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\u2022Spoofing (appropriation of an authentic identity by nonauthentic users with the attempt to cause fraud or attack critical infrastructure)\u2022Intellectual property infringement\u2022Other\n\nNumber of noncriminal emergencies, including:\n\u2022Accidents (within the facility)\u2022Accidents (automotive)\u2022Accidents (in the proximate area)\u2022Dangerous behavior\u2022Fires and smoke conditions\u2022False alarms\u2022Losses of utilities\u2022Malfunctions of critical equipment\u2022Slips and falls\u2022Water and flood damage\u2022Wind damage\u2022Other\n\nNumber of service activities, including:\n\u2022Complaints and miscellaneous\u2022Compliance \u2013 regulatory\u2022Employee records checks\u2022Escort services\u2022Executive protection detail\u2022Information provided\u2022Investigations (internal)\u2022Investigations (personnel-related)\u2022Investigation (external)\u2022Key runs\u2022Lock or key service\u2022Lost and found\u2022Visit by inspectors or regulators\n3.\nHandling personnel administration. The recruiting, screening, hiring, training, supervising, promoting, disciplining, terminating, and conducting of other personnel-related activities are expectations of high-performance security operations (see Chapters 3\u2013734567).\n\n",

In 1972, LEAA created the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. This group undertook a number of detailed, analytical reviews of various issues connected with criminal justice. For each review a varied group of specialists was convened, supported by research and support staffs, and encouraged to look at a problem critically and prospectively. One such group was the Private Security Task Force (PSTF). Following a series of discussions and inquiries stretching over 18 months, the PSTF issued its comprehensive report in 1976.5\nDrafters and authors of the PSTF were individuals representing law enforcement officials, corporate security directors, and an executive of a major security services company. The report identified almost 80 goals and standards for private security. The list encompassed such areas as licensing, regulations, consumer services, personnel training, crime prevention systems, hourly compensation, and conduct and ethics. The Report of the Private Security Task Force was not intended as an impetus to achieve federal legislation to regulate aspects of the security industry; rather, its intention was to identify significant issues that would stimulate local and state laws and codes to be passed or strengthened. Also, it would serve as an industry guide to improvement in procedures. An outline of these standards and goals is included (Appendix C) because, despite the passage of these codes, so many of these modest proposals have yet to be enacted by states or the federal government.",

Yet the industry and the performance of security services \u2013 both proprietary and contract \u2013 have experienced steady growth from a period beginning at least since the end of World War II to the present. Why? Several reasons exist for the growth of private security. Senior executives do not accept their subordinates\u2019 recommendations for increased security expenditures \u2013 or any other kinds of financial allocation \u2013 without rational justification. Such asset allocations are generally predicated on defined needs that the organization has identified and that, therefore, make the existence of security expenditures an informed imperative, rather than a capricious decision.\n",

Notable among these was the Bank Security Act of 1968.\u00a7\nThis law was passed because bank crimes had grown steadily during the decade. The increased incidence of bank robberies, burglaries, and extortions prompted Congress to require all federally chartered banking institutions to undertake particular security measures to reduce the risk of successful criminal acts. In retrospect, the measure in itself did not reduce the growing pattern of violent and property crimes against financial institutions covered by the Act: in fact, they kept increasing for years after passage of the law.\u00b6\nThis Act was significantly modified years later to make requirements more reflective of changing circumstances. For example, the original law of 1968 produced regulations for Minimum Security Devices and Procedures (12CFR21). These included specific language related to antitheft technology, which became less relevant with the introduction of new and better cameras and recording media. By the 1990s, bankers possessed greater latitude with regards to designing security systems most appropriate for their needs. While the Bank Security Act is not directly associated with decreasing bank crime patterns, common sense argues that such institutions must implement reasonable security measures to protect employees and the public. Perhaps without the vigorous measures that were instituted by this law, bank crime would have increased. This act is an example of the federal government passing a measure that demands a distinctive private sector security response. In the process this law aided the role of security management to grow as a management practice in a particular sphere, in this case financial industries. Other federal measures would follow.",

Additionally United Airlines Flight 93, leaving Newark, New Jersey, heading for San Francisco, was skyjacked and then commandeered by passengers resulting in a crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing 44 including the terrorists.) In the situation within New York City, the startling reality is that perhaps 15,000 lives were saved by the prompt actions of alert, trained floor fire marshals and also by security officers \u2013 the true first responders \u2013 who personally assisted countless masses of terrified office workers rushing out of the Towers in a true life and death struggle. That day hit the contract security guard industry hard. Twenty-nine security officers from four providers died in the process. Other proprietary security personnel also were lost. This tragic event with response from security services missed the attention of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States where only a brief mention of private security is found in the commission\u2019s report.6\n",

            "text": "Personnel-based services may be divided into seven categories:1.\nSecurity guard services. This category absorbs a number of protection workers with varying responsibilities, including extensive public service contact (\u201cofficers\u201d), asset protection specialists (\u201cguards\u201d), receptionists, patrol officers, executive protection personnel, watchmen, timekeepers, and others. These personnel provide both the important \u201cvisible security\u201d presence required by many protective objectives and the less apparent, behind-the-scenes securing of physical assets by deterring, detecting, and reporting activity related to threats to people or property.2.\nCentral station services. The computing revolution has permitted organizations to monitor people, places, and events with efficiency and accuracy. Originally, central stations provided burglar alarm, fire notification, and messenger-requesting signals. Today, burglar and fire alarms remain the core of such services, but numerous other monitoring functions are also available, such as remote visual monitoring. Expenditures for such services have grown steadily in the past 25 years, and have surpassed, or are about equal to, the amount contracted out for security guard services.3.\nPrivate investigation services. In the past, investigators were linked to the resolution of specific losses. That\u2019s still true, but assignments faced by contemporary investigators are broader. Investigators today are much more likely to conduct evaluations to make sure that corporate policies are maintained, such as by assuring that licensing fees and payments are properly documented. Investigators are frequently integral in due diligence fact-finding (i.e., the vigilant care needed in a given situation) prior to acquiring an asset or related to litigation involving the organization. This category of contracted service continues to grow in importance for proprietary security programs.4.\nArmored car services. Ever since Washington Perry Brink started his transport business with a horse and a wagon in the nineteenth century, customers have turned to outside organizations to physically move assets. In addition to transporting cash, these services may provide activities such as the servicing of automated teller machines (ATMs) and the transporting of high-value noncash assets such as jewelry and computer tapes and documents. They also handle aspects of cash management for financial organizations removing such services from traditional bank services.5.\nConsultant and other services. When particular problems emerge, security operations managers often turn to consultants with special expertise in particular activities. Most major industries and most types of specific security concerns \u2013 for example, data protection and financial investigations \u2013 can retain the services of such persons or their organizations for a defined period of time to achieve the desired goals. Due to the shrinking of central staff management in the past 25 years, managerial resources were reduced and the use of outside consultants replaced in-house management capabilities on an as-needed basis. Meanwhile, other services are equally significant to organizations. For example, in the event of a loss of computer processing capability, an organization may turn to facilities that have compatible hardware that may be commandeered for immediate use.6.\nElectronic security equipment and systems. To provide more control at less cost, managers turn to electronic security equipment, which can augment, supplement, and verify the actions of security personnel. Though smaller than personnel-intensive services, capital outlay for such equipment is growing steadily. The ways these funds are allocated are given as follows:a.\nIntrusion detection equipment. These devices and systems indicate the unauthorized passage of individuals into a protected area.b.\nVehicle security systems. These products deter and detect the theft or removal of cars, trucks, vans, and other mobile conveyances.c.\nComputer security equipment. Because of the importance of data protection, systems to protect information assets are growing at a substantial rate and play an important role in loss deterrence for data systems.d.\nCC/IPTV equipment. Security operations increasingly use CC/IPTV systems to monitor, analyze, and record activities. (This is also called video surveillance technology.)e.\nFire detection equipment. Facilities are required to use fire detection systems by codes, standards, insurance requirements, or common sense.f.\nElectronic article surveillance (EAS) systems. These systems are primarily used to control the losses of retail merchandise. However, EAS systems also may be applied to broader applications of assets control.g.\nAccess control equipment. Systems to efficiently allow or deny entrance make an important contribution to operating a secure facility. This category is closely related technically to intrusion detection equipment.h.\nSecure telephone equipment. This equipment protects telephone and data transmissions from unauthorized interception.i.\nX-ray inspection equipment. X-ray impressions may identify the presence of weapons or contraband material hidden in packages or on persons.j.\nMetal detection equipment. These systems identify metal content hidden within packages or on persons. Wide applications are found at airport preboard screening and the checking of people and hand parcels entering at-risk locations.k.\nBiological, nuclear, and chemical detection. Still another way of identifying contraband is the use of technology to identify the chemical signatures of such materials. These may result in an alarm being sounded or in a security officer setting aside a suspicious object for further evaluation.\n7.\nMechanical security hardware. In addition to personnel and electronic devices, systems, and software, security operations often require the purchase and use of particular products and materials. Hence, any object or material that is not electronic is categorized as mechanical security hardware. This category also is substantial, and projected to grow along with construction needs. While electronic products and systems are in the spotlight, mechanical locks continue to have sufficient applications to assure their continuance. This category includes safes, vaults, glazing, and other products specifically marketed for their protective features. A door that is required to be intrusion-resistant would be included in this category; a normal door would not be. Locking devices including door locks, padlocks, deadbolts, latches, as well as security storage equipment such as safes and vaults and fire extinguishers, and related products are also included in this category.\n",

(These issues are discussed in greater detail in the final chapter of this book.) The following is a list of the top 26 security threats and management issues:\u2022\nComputer/communications security (e.g., Internet/intranet security). Protecting assets relating to attacks on information resources and misuse of information technology (IT) is a large task. It has grown in significance for managers and currently ranks highest among 26 concerns. Computer attacks against an organization can be on a scale from minimal to catastrophic.12\n\u2022\nBusiness continuity planning/organizational resilience. Emergencies in organizations can be due to nature-based, people-based, design-based, and technology-based factors, among others.13\nThe crisis or contingency manager seeks to avoid a crisis from occurring by establishing contingency plans.\u2022\nWorkplace violence prevention/response. For most people, the workplace is a safe place. But occasionally, violence intrudes into an otherwise nonviolent environment. Despite such events being uncommon, the issue cannot be dismissed by managers; indeed, it is at or near the top of any list of workplace concerns.14\nDiligent managers must take measures to make employees feel safe on the job, and at the same time deter disgruntled employees, terminated workers, enraged customers or clients, and others from untoward action.\u2022\nEmployee selection/screening. Security directors frequently are involved in directing, assessing, and improving ways by which new employees may be screened (vetted) before an offer of employment or a significant promotion is made (see Chapter 3).\u2022\nEnvironmental/social: privacy concerns. The word \u201cprivacy\u201d does not appear in the Constitution. However, invasion of one\u2019s personal information has grown to be a risk that can result in legal action if harm occurs that could have been avoided.\u2022\nProperty crime (e.g., external theft, vandalism). An omnipresent concern for security practitioners is minor and major larceny against the assets of the organization. Security operations seek to decrease the opportunity for such acts by instituting appropriate, cost-effective controls.\u2022\nGeneral employee theft. Despite the best efforts to screen-in the most productive and honest workers, experience shows that employees represent serious risks. Generally, employee deviance represents only a few within the workforce. However, due to their understanding of the security vulnerabilities, these few can cause substantial losses of assets.\u2022\nCrisis management and response: domestic terrorism. Risk exposures can occur at home and abroad. The security practitioner has the duty to qualify and manage threats and vulnerabilities.15\nOrganizations that operate in nations where there are risks to employees and assets require constant monitoring. Optimal security operations must seek to assess the risks in various nations. They must further stay abreast of any changing conditions that could lead to threats to employees or expropriations of assets. In the event of an emergency, security planners must attempt to remove employers safely from harm\u2019s way.\u2022\nUnethical business conduct. In many circumstances, one of the tasks for security operations is to play varying roles in drafting, monitoring, and enforcing an organizational code of ethical conduct.16\n\u2022\nIdentity theft. In a recent year almost 12 million persons were victimized by the effects from identity theft in the United States. The crime has no borders, so victims are found globally. Workplaces are impacted when merchandise is transported to perpetrators or their agents.17\n\u2022\nEnvironmental/social pandemics (e.g., Ebola virus). Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other viral attacks impact the workplace, although immediate risks are few. Typically, organizations plan on how to conduct operations as close to normal as possible in the unlike event that a pandemic hits close to home. In 2014, security directors of global organizations prepared contingency plans in the event that operations or supply chain activity was interrupted by the Ebola virus.\u2022\nCrisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disaster (evacuation potential). The supply chain can be shut down if a key material, part, or assembly cannot be delivered due to an interruption. Security practitioners have roles in assuring that, as far as possible, alternative resources are available. Similarly, some security programs have 24/7 active monitoring of global conditions where the organization operates.\u2022\nLitigation: inadequate security. The reality or fear of legal action for negligence is one of the driving features in security management today. Security program operators are involved in a variety of activities related to these risks, including instituting procedures and controls to reduce such risks and preparing actions or defenses for legal cases.18\n\u2022\nFraud/white-collar crime. The term \u201cwhite-collar crime\u201d was coined by the sociologist Edwin Sutherland, and signifies unlawful, nonviolent conduct committed by corporations and individuals. It includes theft, fraud, and other violations of trust, including embezzlement. Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted with its possession. Frequently, this crime is committed by someone with a fiduciary responsibility within the organization, which he or she then abuses. The investigation and prevention of fraud (i.e., false representation or intentional perversion of truth to induce another to part with something valuable) is an important task in any organization.\n\u2022\nLitigation: negligent hiring/supervision. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the employer may be held responsible for negligence by an employee. Training that informs workers on what they can and cannot do can mitigate claims. Risk analysis further lowers workplace vulnerability to lawsuits.19\n\u2022\nSubstance abuse (drugs/alcohol in the workplace). Employee drug testing is widely used in industry. Policies, procedures, consent forms, checklists, and training materials are needed for such programs.20\n\u2022\nBusiness espionage/theft of trade secrets. For many organizations, the loss of crucial information is of greater importance than the fraudulent disappearance of products or supplies. These transgressions include espionage or theft of trade secrets, including developmental procedures and know-how.\u2022\nEnvironmental/social robberies. Robberies are categorized as the third most significant crime in the hierarchy of the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports. Robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of someone. Force or threat of force of violence and putting the victim in fear is a characteristic of this crime. Robbery mitigation is likely to succeed when risk mitigation is put into place.\u2022\nIntellectual property/brand protection/product counterfeiting. The brand, product, and information of an organization are precious assets. Intellectual property can walk out the door or be accessed through a few keystrokes. Security practitioners are interested in preventing this loss and also investigating possible incursions early on to lessen the damage.21\n\u2022\nGlobal supply chain security. The stealing of goods that are being transported or stored is an ongoing concern for product manufacturers and distributors.22\nOutright theft requires prompt investigation and response. Broad transportation issues include container tracking and transit point security.\u2022\nExecutive protection (including travel security). The protection of senior officials from risk has become a highly evolved skill that draws upon management planning and analysis.23\nProtection choreography, advance security preparations, domestic and international travel assessment, and physical training are all involved in the process.\u2022\nInsurance/workers\u2019 compensation fraud. Organizations that provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance sometimes encounter abuse, which requires investigation and response. A security program is generally tasked with investigating other incidents concerning insurance claims.\u2022\nCrisis management and response: international terrorism. The bombings of the World Trade Center, the Boston Marathon, the Oklahoma City federal building, and public and private assets in various locales domestically and globally suggest the importance of measures to deter such attacks.24\nAs a global activity, security planners look at risks from unstable parts of the world, and political risks from groups such as ISIS (or ISIL) that could destabilize the world and affect conventional operations.\u2022\nBombings/bomb threats. Bombings in the workplace are rare. Bomb threats are frequent. Security practitioners devise strategies to analyze and deal with threats as they are received.\n\u2022\nLabor unrest. Currently, labor\u2013management relationships remain adversarial, as always, and as they are supposed to be. This does not necessarily lead to unrest. However, when issues flare, the matter becomes a security priority.\u2022\nCrisis management and response: kidnapping and extortion. Kidnapping (i.e., the forcible abduction of a person from his or her residence or business) for profit via ransom payment is rare in the United States. Extortion (i.e., obtaining property by threatening to injure or commit any other criminal offense) is more common and sometimes involves features of kidnapping. Organizations operating in kidnapping-for-profit countries make broad preparations to protect employees from victimization.\n",

Complaints of harassments by coworkers or others at the workplace have been recurrent in recent years. Similarly, alleged violations of the EEOC guarantees have affected security operations. Both types of allegations require investigation and response.\u2022\nProduct diversion. Sometimes, products are sold abroad at a lower price than what is charged to distributors and retailers in other markets. The manufacturer loses revenues when these products intended to be sold into the lower-priced market are surreptitiously sold back into the domestic distribution channels by a third party. Security operations must seek to prevent such transshipment and to investigate any suspected incidents that may be encountered.\u2022\nProduct tampering or sabotage. The integrity of a product is vital to its maker. Sometimes, however, products are intentionally adulterated. In extreme situations, this willful and malicious destruction of property can lead to injury and death. Additionally, the organization can have its valuable market position threatened by the results.\u2022\nOrganized crime. Criminal activity that is perpetuated by individuals who are systematized and concerted to common goals is defined as organized crime. It is not solely a law enforcement problem but also directly of importance to any organizations affected by it.\n",

These skills include program initiation, ongoing monitoring, and constant endeavors to improve performance. Corporate security endeavors are still new, having been the focus of independent research only in recent decades. Yet the reasons for the growth of such services involve diverse psychological, legal, social, and financial requisites. Politics and federal and state laws have helped shape security services. The horrific events of 9/11 and legislation passed since then have provided a reshaping of what the public sector expects from private security. The changing priorities of security practitioners in large corporations focus on workplace violence, crisis management, and executive protection, although the nature of those concerns differs according to the particular industry of the corporation.",
