At this time, 39 of SSA's 48 countries [excluding Burundi, Comoros, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Sao Tome and Principe] all reported confirmed cases of coronavirus and imported transmission as the major mode of spread. Despite aggressive response by SSA countries to stymie the outbreak, the number of reported new cases and deaths continue to increase. As of March 30, 2020, South Africa is the only country with more than 1,000 cases, and eight countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Ghana, Mauritius and Nigeria including South Africa account for 80% of SSA's COVID-19 disease outbreak ( Figure 1 ).",

In running Lasso, the dataset was split into two sample groups; Group 1 was training datasets we used to select our model, and Group 2 our testing datasets we used to test the prediction. We used Lasso because of its greater prediction accuracy and increased model interpretability. For the inferential statistics, we used the Cross-fit partialing out Lasso technique to estimate the coefficients, robust standard errors, p-values and confidence intervals of the specified variables of interest while the other covariates were selected as controls in the model.",

Overall, in figure 2a, the matrix graph showed that a majority, 82% (13/17) of the continuous variables indicated strong to moderate positive linear relationships, while two variables, Out-of-pocket expenditure and HIV incidence rate in children aged 0-14 years showed strong negative linear relationships. Prevalence of smoking was weakly correlated with coronavirus. Approximately 31% (12/39) of the SSA countries had missing information on smoking prevalence and this may have impacted on this variable as evident with the significant Chi-square goodness of fit \u03c72 (1) = 5.77, p= 0.016. All other variables included in the analysis had complete data for almost all countries, however, in few countries where data was missing, this was \u2264 5%.

Many countries are requesting individuals to stay at home in self-quarantine, closing borders and imposing lockdowns and curfews. Schools were ordered to close in the Nigerian Federal Capital Territory of Abuja after only eight cases were confirmed nationwide in the month of February 2020. South Africa banned visitors from high-risk countries, closed schools and quickly opened drive-through testing centers in Johannesburg. The steady decline in the ROC of coronavirus as indicated in our study from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 suggests that measures instituted by countries to stem the outbreak is showing signs of future success. This finding fits with a recent modeling study showing that a combination of multiple approaches (i.e. social distancing, home isolation of cases, augmented by school and university closures) has a substantial effect on slowing coronavirus transmission in a short term. On the other hand, the declining ROC may be attributed to low testing capacity in SSA. Marius Gilbert et al, in a modelling study highlighted differences in African countries capacity to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability 18 . So far in SSA only a handful of countries (i.e. South Africa, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria) have provided official figures on COVID-19 testing data. Spatial Autocorrelation analysis using the Global Moran's I statistics indicated that coronavirus was spreading randomly across SSA. A major limitation in this study was that geocoordinate data used for this analysis represents locations of SSA countries not necessarily where COVID-19 disease was detected, and this may have influenced results. At the time of this analysis, geocoordinates of counties, districts, and/or testing locations for coronavirus were not publicly available. The interpolated maps in our study show that coronavirus is increasing and spreading outwards per day to countries in central Africa and the virus appears to be severely confined in South Africa and in the west African region. The interpolated maps also suggest that countries in the west African region are most likely to repot increased number of deaths in the coming weeks compared to countries in central and Southern Africa.",

The lasso regression model indicated that new HIV infections among pediatrics, adolescents and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time, pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment could significantly predict coronavirus disease in SSA. This study can be repeated using more detailed patient-level granular data to provide more insight into the essential characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Our study suggests that experiences learned from the HIV epidemic can be applied to the fight against COVID-19. As in the AIDS response, governments should work with communities and civil society organizations to find local solutions, and health interventions delivered in an integrated manner. Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea are essential to accelerating global health efforts. Lessons learned from the HIV epidemics have shown that restrictive, stigmatizing and punitive measures can lead to significant human rights abuses, with disproportionate effects on already vulnerable communities. They can often undermine epidemic responses, sending people with symptoms underground and failing to address the underlying barriers that people face in attempting to protect their own health and that of their community. An approach that moves away from compulsory restrictions towards a focus on reaching and serving those who are most vulnerable, scaling up screening and testing for those most in need, empowering people with knowledge and tools to protect themselves and others (e.g. for COVID-19, increased social/spatial spacing) and the removal of barriers, mirrors the learnings from the HIV response.",
