Many patients with CRC may develop liver metastases at some point during the course of their disease [3]. Generally, colorectal cancer does not show any symptoms until advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, early diagnosis is very important to identify adenomatous tissue in pretumoral lesions to remove it before it becomes neoplastic tissue.",

Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing-1 (CTHRC1) and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 3 (NFE2L3) may be useful biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of CRC since they have shown an increase messenger RNA transcripts (mRNA) expression level in colorectal tumours when compared with normal tissues [9-12].",

It is highly expressed in cartilage, developing bones, and myofibroblasts during skin wound healing and its expression is increased in fibroblasts and chondrocytic cells in response to TGF-beta family members [13]. CTHRC1 inhibit TGF-beta signalling which can lead to a reduction in collagen type I deposition during vascular remodelling. In addition, it has been shown that CTHRC1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer [9-11]. In addition, CTHRC1 is implicated in breast cancer, suggesting that CTHRC1 expression in this type of tumour is associated with cancer tissue invasion and metastasis [14]. In recent studies it was suggested that CTHRC1 inhibition may represent a potential method for decreasing melanoma resistance to conventional chemotherapy [15].",

NFE2L3 has been described as a regulator of the antioxidant-response element (ARE) [17]. Also, recently, a high mRNA NFE2L3 expression has been detected in human placenta and it has been related to placental and developmental expression [18]. NFE2L3 was also expressed in relation to ovarian serous papillary carcinoma [19], solid tumour formation in stem cells [20], and testicular seminoma diagnosis [21]. NFE2L3 is up-regulated in colorectal cancer [12]. Recent studies showed the first in vivo function of NFE2L3 and its link to tumour development using a NFE2L3 - deficient mice. This study showed that the absence of NFE2L3 predisposes mice to lymphoma development, suggesting a protective role of this transcription factor in hematopoietic malignancies [22].",

Cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C until they reached mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.5). At that moment, expression of the CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 recombinant proteins were induced with the addition of L-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% w/v and incubated during three hours at 37\u00b0C. Then, cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mM Imidazol. Due to the insolubility of the proteins, an additional step was done consisting in a ClGn-6 M extraction and finally an additional purification step in a column prepacked with Ni Sepharose (His GraviTrap\u2122 from GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) was carried out.",

DELFIA technology can be useful for the CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 detection because it offers high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, stability, possibility of multiplexing, and reducing the amount of samples. The antibodies pairs selected for the assay were chosen to avoid as much background as possible. Chessboard reagent titration experiments were carried out to define optimal assay parameters. The assay was optimised as it was recommended by the Perkin Elmer DELFIA guide. The combination of antibodies pair chosen for the assay were MAbs CH21D7/CH24D7 for CTHRC1 detection and sFab E5/PAb for NFE2L3 detection. The chessboard reagent titrations showed that the optimal concentrations of antibodies were 0.06 \u03bcg/well MAb of CH21D7 and 0.5 \u03bcg/well of E5 as capture antibodies and a dilution 1:40000 of PAb and 1:500 of CH24D7 as detection antibodies. Washing condition was optimized to 6 washes after incubation with samples and detection antibodies to reduce background. The shaking speed was optimised to 125 rpm and the incubation time with enhancement solution to 15 min to increase the signal. The CTHRC1 readings were not affected by the presence of the anti-NFE2L3 reagents or NFE2L3 reading by the presence of anti-CTHRC1 reagents. The sensitivities of the assays for CH21D7 and NFE2L3 detection were 0.5 - 2.0 ng/ml.",

Already in 2006 [29], it was demonstrated with the patent EP2177628A2 that the CTHRC1 was related to CRC and could be used as marker for its diagnosis since CTHRC1 was over-expressed in CRC reaching mRNA level of 22-fold compared to normal cells. In another study, it was shown that the CTHRC1 expression was dramatically up-regulated in several cancer types including CRC [30]. In the same way, the relation of NFE2L3 to cancer was studied by other investigators, showing that 20 genes, including the gene encoding NFE2L3, were up-regulated in colorectal cancer cells [12] and in adenomas when compared with normal tissues [9-12]. Based on these investigations, it is clear that the information available indicates that CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins are useful candidates to determine the progress of CRC. For example, in our patent EP2008/010665, we described a method for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of colorectal tumour by NFE2L3 detection [31].",

Therefore, it is really important to have specific antibodies against these two biomarkers to facilitate further studies and make possible to set up immunological assays for CRC diagnosis. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to select PAb, MAbs, and sFab fragments against CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins and to develop immunoassays for CRC diagnosis. We obtained several specific antibodies against the two biomarkers which were analyzed carefully. However, we concentrated our efforts on analysing CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in cell lines since they are the most frequently used living systems in research and they can be used as model for biomarker detection [32-34]. In addition, leukocytes and lymphocytes were used for NFE2L3 detection since there is some information showing that NFE2L3 mRNA is highly expressed in B cell and monocyte lineage [16].",

Western blot showed a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in HT29 cells which corresponds to the theoretical size of 26.2 kDa according to Collagen triple helix repeat-containing protein 1 precursor from UniProtKB at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96CG8[35]. The CTHRC1 detection in CRC cells was proved by a DAS-ELISA DAS with the MAbs CH21D7 and CH24G2. Also, we were able to detect with the assay the CTHRC1 protein in HT29 and SW620 cell lines, but not in the negative control protein extract. This DAS-ELISA had a sensitivity of 2.0 ng/ml. In the same way, we showed the NFE2L3 protein expression in CRC cells. Several protein bands were detected by Western blot in CRC cell lines, leukocytes and lymphocytes corresponding to the molecular weight of 44-, 65-, and 77 kDa. The protein band pattern obtained in our result was formed probably due the processing of the native protein. In theory, the expected molecular weight of NFE2L3 should be 76.1 kDa according to Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3 from UniProtKB at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y4A8[36], however, in the practice the size of NFE2L3 can vary according to proteins glycosylation or proteolysis. There are some indications of multiple NFE2L3 formation shown mainly in the study of Zhang et al. Our results are partially in concordance with the NFE2L3 size shown in this study in which a synthesized protein of approximately 96-kDa was subsequently converted into isoforms of approximately 90, 80, and 70 kDa [37]. In addition of the bands mentioned above, their work showed two smaller bands, hypothesizing that they are created through either translation from two internal start codons at Met173 and Met211 or from the proteolytic cleavage occurring within a central region [37]. The native NFE2L3 detection was confirmed by DAS-ELISA with PAb, MAbs, and sFabs against NFE2L3 in CRC cells and leukocytes. Also, we were able to detect with this DAS-ELISA the NFE2L3 protein in HT29 and SW620 cell lines, but not in the negative control protein extract. The assays sensitivities were 0.5 - 5.0 ng/ml.",

When the two colorimetric DAS-ELISA were converted to DELFIA assays for single measurement, the sensitivity was increase to 3-fold. When two individual DELFIA assays were combined, the sensitivity decreased to range of the colorimetric DAS-ELISA. We were able to develop an assay to detect the two biomarkers simultaneously. The DELFIA assay was successfully developed. Even, when the sensitivity was not improved in this case with DELFIA several advantages have been incorporated to the original DAS-ELISA with this technology. Some of these advantages can be useful in medical diagnostic including cost-, time-, and samples- reduction and signal stability. The sensitivity of our DELFIA assay is in the process to be improved by replacing the pre-labelled secondary antibodies with primary lanthanide-labelled antibodies.",

The diagnostic/prognostic in the serum of patients can be limited by the presence of highly abundant albumin and immunoglobulins that constitute approximately 60-97% of the total serum proteins [38] or by other components. However, in our study we were not able to see any differences between the detection with and without serum, indicating that measurement of our biomarkers is unaffected by highly abundant proteins in serum (data not shown). We are in the process to improve the assay sensitivity and performance by labelling the PAb, MAb CH24D7 and MAb 41HF8 directly with Samarium and Europium.
