Among them, some appear like apoptotic bodies. Partial regional type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively, with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus. In some case, cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 2.3 ) . The alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies, mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining, around which a transparent halo is visible (Fig. 2.4 ) . Pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries, swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells, as well as widening of the latter, which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infi ltration, small vessel proliferation, and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes. Some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fi brinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components. In addition, some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage, compensatory emphysema, and small airway necrotizing infl ammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage. Patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fi broblast proliferation in alveolar septa, and individual cases demonstrate organization of fi brinous exudates from alveoli and fi broblast proliferation, which gives rise to glomeruloid structures, named \"glomeruloid organizing pneumonia\" (Fig. 2 .5 ). The bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation, scarce and exfoliated cilia, as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside. The bronchioli are detected with submucosal edema, infl ammatory cell infi ltration, and serous grandular hyperplasia with hyperactive secretion.",

All the three changes of infl ammation in early phase (degeneration, exudation, hyperplasia) are observable. The mechanism of acute lung injury induced by SARS may be ascribed to SARS coronavirus direct attack of alveolar epithelia and alveolar capillary epithelia or (and) indirect damage via lymphocyte, macrophage and effector cells, and lymphokine, cytokine, and infl ammatory mediator released by them. This suggests that besides viral direct infection, immune reactions are also involved in lung injury.

In the recovery phase, only some cases develop into pulmonary interstitial proliferation and then cause fi brotic changes. Pulmonary interstitial proliferation and fi brosis degree and outcome are associated with the extent of pulmonary involvement in peak phase, occurrence of complications, and treatment. Generally, if lesions on chest image are light in peak phase, there will be fewer pulmonary changes left in recovery phase. Contrarily, patients with diffusive lung interstitial thickening in recovery phase are often those suffering from relatively severe pulmonary injury in peak phase and involvement of the great mass of lungs, particularly patients with recurrent conditions, protracted course, and concurrent infections. Researches demonstrate that 7-8 % of SARS patients have pulmonary fi brosis of varying degrees and male patients display relatively more obvious pulmonary impairment than female patients. Primary manifestations are lung dysfunction, such as decrease of pulmonary diffusion capacity, lung capacity impairment, and change of total lung capacity particularly residual volume.",

Then there is the shrinkage of intrapulmonary patchy shadows with increase of density and gradual formation of high-density cord and honeycomb shadows inside lungs. Severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could diminish lung volume and compel the mediastinum to affected side. Besides, pulmonary interstitial proliferation could occur extensively inside lungs, predominated by lobular septum, intralobular interstitial thickening, and subpleural curvature shadows, as well as irregular high-density plaque and cord-like shadows at some regions. Honeycombshaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis are signs of pulmonary interstitial fi brosis. CT reveals cord, reticulate, and honeycomb-shaped shadows, and HRCT could better visualize the subtle abnormal changes of pulmonary interstitium, such as lobular septum thickening, intralobular interstitial thickening, subpleural curvature shadows, and honeycomb-shaped shadows. Whether the cord-like and reticulate changes visualized by CT are completely absorbed or induce persistent fi brosis still entails long-term follow-up observation ( Fig. 2.16 ).",

Its pathogenesis still remains not completely ascertained, and it may be ascribed to improper use of hormones and injury of sclerotin from SARS viruses, bacterial embolism, lipid embolism, or multiple mixed factors. The primary pathological change of aseptic necrosis of femoral head is degenerative alteration due to femoral head blood circulation disturbance, mainly characterized by limping and pain. The lower limb of the affected side is relatively shorter and presents with light fl exion and adduction, as well as with slightly limited abduction and intorsion.",

Gradually ensue the increase of density as a result of osteonecrosis, which meanwhile is interspersed with some transparent shadows. Femoral head may become fl at, fragmented, and irregular in contour from pressures. Typical femoral head necrosis appears in the shape of wedge, with the base toward articular surface and the top toward metaphysis. Since lesions are dominantly confi ned at the anterosuperior area of femoral head, lateral imaging of hip joints could clearly reproduce the extent of lesions. The necrotic area is encircled by a ring of transparent band. Hip articular cavity may become wider and irregular due to fl attening of the femur. Sometimes, there may be complication of dislocation. The fragments of femoral head may be shed off into the joint, giving rise to joint mouse. Normal femoral head is located at the acetabular center in the transverse CT image and may appear in the shape of sphere or hook on different layers, with delicate high-density bone cortex at the periphery. The high-density trabeculae inside femoral head are arranged in stelliform formation from the center continually to bone cortex, named as \"stelliform sign.\" CT manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head can be divided into early and advanced phase. In the early phase, the stelliform sign formed by the trabeculae of femoral head is deformed or absent, presenting spotted and patchy shadows of increased density inside femoral head and fasciculate changes or mutual fusion at its periphery. In the advanced phase, femoral head become ruptured and out of shape, and absorption of sclerotin between bone fragments appears as irregular low-density area, with stelliform sign disappeared.",

The T1 high signals of normal femoral head on T1-weighted image are detected with black linear low signals (representing demarcation between normal and ischemic bone tissues). On T2-weighted image, a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line, thus forming the typical double-line sign. The double-line sign could refl ect congestion and infl ammation of granula-tion tissues and proves specifi c to aseptic necrosis of femoral head. Severe infl ammation, congestion, fi brosis, and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head, which presents liquid-like signals on MRI, low signals on T1-weighted image, and high signals on T2-weighted images. Advanced cases are typical of fi brosis and sclerosis, and the affected area present with fi brotic MRI features, that is, low signals on T1-and T2-weighted and proton densityweighted imaging.
