Epidemiological analysis together with in\u2010depth environmental investigations often provides useful insights,1 and meta\u2010analysis may also be carried out for a particular disease. In this study, we proposed an alternative comparative analysis approach in which we studied outbreaks of different diseases in the same environment using the same approach, by examining differences in the spatial infection patterns. This approach could partly overcome the limitation of traditional individual outbreak analysis that outbreak cannot be repeatedly observed, because the comparative analysis of different diseases in the same environment is like that one disease happened several times. Our hypothesis is that the different transmission routes of infection lead to different spatial patterns of secondary cases. For example, close contact transmission always happens with 1\u20102 m of the source, which means that secondary cases infected via close contact route would be close to the index case(s). The airborne transmission may occur over long distance, and the secondary cases infected via airborne route would distribute uniformly in a space when the air is fully mixed.",

Understanding transmission routes in aircraft cabins is itself an important issue for not only onboard intervention, but also the worldwide infection transmission since air travel had been proved to be important in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak.2 Confined space, limited ventilation, recirculated air, and/or prolonged exposure times, which are common in air travel, are demonstrated risk factors for the transmission of infectious diseases,3 such as tuberculosis, influenza, common cold, SARS, and gastroenteritis.",

In addition, the surface\u2010touching behavior, which is necessary when building a surface contamination network, is expected to vary very significantly, but we assumed that the same behavior is applied uniformly both in time and for individuals during the entire flight. The surface contamination network may be improved as more behavior data become available. Furthermore, the distribution and the constraints for each parameter set that were used might also not be realistic. These assumptions may challenge the conclusion that the fomite route is the dominant one for norovirus. Secondly, only one outbreak was available for our analysis for each virus. Generalization of findings due to one outbreak is questionable.

The study by Teunis et al30 indicated that the infection probability of the droplet route (ie, close contact) and the aerosol route (ie, the airborne route) in a poorly ventilated room is approximately equal. But due to the high ventilation rate (25 per hour) and HEPA filter efficiency of ventilation system in the aircraft, and the close contact route is shown to be probably the most significant in in\u2010flight influenza transmission, the infection risk for passengers sitting close to the index case(s) is significantly high than others. In addition, a review study on human influenza transmission of Brankston et al31 concluded that transmission of influenza occurs at close range rather than over a long distance. Of the 5 in\u2010flight influenza A H1N1 outbreaks reviewed, with detailed distribution of the secondary cases included, 4 showed that the passenger sitting within the first 2 rows of the ill passenger(s) had a higher infection risk than others. The 2009 WHO guidance recommends the contact tracing of passengers seated within 2 rows of an infectious case of influenza during air travel.29 The air change rate and efficiency of the HEPA filter are relatively high in the aircraft ventilation system than other typical indoor environments, so that the airborne pathogens can be removed effectively. In most reported in\u2010flight influenza A H1N1 outbreaks, the attack rate is low (1%\u20105%), but in the seasonal influenza A outbreak in March 1977, when the air conditioning system of a commercial airliner was shut down due to a malfunctioning engine, the attack rate reached 72%.32\n",
