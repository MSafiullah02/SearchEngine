            "text": "Since an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan and related regions in Hubei province[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], an increasing number of exported cases have been confirmed in other provinces of China and multiple countries around the world[[6], [7], [8]]. As of March 10, 2020, more than 110 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 110 countries[9]. The most common clinical manifestation of the disease is fever, fatigue, and dry cough and some patients may present with nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea. In some cases, dyspnea usually occurs one week after the disease onset and some patients can rapidly progress to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation disorders[10, 11]. As the situation progressed over time, more and more asymptomatic individuals were identified due to increased surveillance and contact screening[12]. Those asymptomatic cases may play a role in the transmission and thus pose a significant infection control challenge. To best of our knowledge, so far, there is no special paper describing the features of these patients. Here we report the characteristics of asymptomatic patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Jinan infectious disease hospital, Shandong University. The hospital is the only one designated medical institution for the hospitalization of confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Jinan, capital of Shandong province, China. Furthermore, we compared the features between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases to determine whether there exist factors accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms.",

Compared with symptomatic patients, most of the laboratory test results were not statistically significant. It is worth noting that creatine kinase-MB was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group(P=0.020). Future research is needed to expand the sample to clarify that this indicator does indeed differ between the two groups. Although some asymptomatic patients\u2019 laboratory indicators were abnormal, the damage was minor and soon returned to normal. 7 asymptomatic patients (63.6%) were detected lung abnormalities on chest CT. Compared with symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients had fewer lung CT lesions (63.6% vs 83.3%), and there was also no statistical difference between the two groups. All of the laboratory test results and radiologic findings showed the patients experienced relatively mild illness, which was further evidenced by the short hospital stay of asymptomatic patients(P=0.004). All the patients\u2019 treatment regimen were produced according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. As of 24:00, March 10, 2020, 100%(36/36) symptomatic patients and 81.8% (9/11) asymptomatic patients have been discharged. 2 asymptomatic patients still hospitalized for nucleic acid positive.",

Initially, we hoped to find whether there existed factors accounting for the presence or absence of symptoms which could help us to screen the asymptomatic individuals, and further help to control the disease. In our study, we compared the characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and have not found effective indicators to meet our requirements. Therefore, the symptomatic patients should be given timely isolation and treatment, and relevant contacts should be tracked and quarantined as soon as possible. The timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment of these asymptomatic patients will help control the further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should investigate viral loads and viral dynamics of asymptomatic patients, and examine whether they are different from symptomatic patients. Such researches will enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of the new emerging virus and would help to control the disease early.",
