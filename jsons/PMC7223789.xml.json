            "text": "Since their development in the 1940s, antibacterial drugs have become lifesaving medicines that are integral to human health. Unfortunately, antibacterial drug resistance is widespread amongst pathogenic bacteria, which significantly reduces the medical effectiveness of currently marketed drugs. These drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria have been acknowledged by Governments and scientists as one of the world\u2019s most pressing health issues; however, the discovery and development of new antibiotics and antibiotic-alternatives to treat these infections is not straightforward. As a consequence, it is important to analyze the antibacterial development pipeline to capture a snapshot of what is happening today and compare it to previous years. This review provides an update to previous reviews in this series in 2015 [1], 2013 [2] and 2011 [3], which are complementary to recent reviews that describe the pre-clinical [4] and clinical pipeline [5\u201311]. There have also been several important reviews that analyze the lead discovery and development of antibiotics [12\u201322], antibiotic alternatives [23\u201325], \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors [26, 27], and antibiotic conjugate and prodrug strategies [28]. There has also been reviews that discuss issues with antibiotic stewardship, resistance and, the commercialization challenge [29\u201341].",

Small molecule antibacterials, BLI combinations, and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) that are being evaluated in phase-I, -II, or -III clinical trials and under pre-approval regulatory evaluation as of 31 October 2019 (Tables 2\u20135, Figs. 4\u201312) are reviewed highlighting their development status, mode of action, spectra of activity, historical discovery, and origin of the lead compound\u2019s pharmacophore. The clinical trial codes, which are predominantly from ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT), are listed in parentheses for each antibacterial, while non-registered trials are referenced at least by a Press Release or peer-reviewed publication. A list of on-line clinical trial databases can be found in the Supplementary information. Repurposed drugs that have not previously been approved as antibacterials have been included in this analysis. Pro-drugs are grouped together with their active metabolites, while ongoing trials of antibacterial drugs that already approved anywhere in the world are not discussed but are listed in Table S2. Compounds for which no development activity has been reported since 2017 are listed in Table 6. The antibacterials in clinical development have been further analyzed by phase and source derivation (Fig. 13) and to the previous 2011 [3], 2013 [2], and 2015 [1] reviews (Fig. 14). An analysis of new antibacterial pharmacophores (Table 7, Figs. 15 and 16) and administration routes (Figs. S1 and S2) has also been undertaken.",

Of the 38 new antibacterials, five were first-in-class: linezolid (oxazolidinone, S, 2000), daptomycin (lipopeptide, NP, 2003), retapamulin (pleuromutilin, NP-derived, 2007), fidaxomicin (tiacumicin, NP, 2011) and bedaquiline (diarylquinoline, S, 2012). These five antibacterials have Gram-positive (G+ve) activity only; however, bedaquiline is noteworthy as it was the first new drug class approved for tuberculosis (TB) since 1963 [44]. Although the approval of a new class of G-ve antibacterial is still elusive, there has been two new BLI classes launched (diazabicyclooctane (DBO)-BLI (avibactam, S, 2015) and boron-type BLI (vaborbactam (12), S, 2017)) that have activity in combination with \u03b2-lactams against G-ve bacteria. Two of the approved mAbs, raxibacumab [45] and obiltoxaximab [46], help reduce the effects of anthrax toxins but further work is required to fully establish their efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies [47]. Bezlotoxumab is a mAb that binds and neutralizes Clostridioides difficile (formally Clostridium difficile [48]) toxin B, which is approved to help reduce the occurrence of C. difficile infections (CDI) in patients undergoing antibacterial drug treatments [49, 50].",

The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) (New York, NY, USA) has been evaluating pretomanid (8) in three phase-III trials: in combination with linezolid and bedaquiline (NCT03086486), linezolid (NCT02333799), and linezolid, bedaquiline, moxifloxacin and clofazimine (NCT02589782). A phase-III in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide was completed in May 2018 (NCT02342886). Pretomanid (8) acts as prodrug that is reductively activated by the deazaflavin (cofactor F420)-dependent nitroreductase Rv3547 [93\u201395]. Pretomanid (8) inhibits cell wall growth in aerobic conditions by hindering mycolic acid formation, while its activity involves the induction of respiratory poisoning under anaerobic conditions [93\u201395]. A recent report has also implicated the production of methylglyoxal using an untargeted metabolomics approach [96].",

Interestingly, the R enantiomer of sulopenem caused unpleasant sulfurous odors when dosed in human volunteers and the racemate CP65,207 could not be used [136]. Pfizer re-started clinical development in 2003 using a more efficient production-scale synthesis procedure to help alleviate the cost issue [137, 138]. In late 2015, Iterum Therapeutics plc (Dublin, Ireland) licensed sulopenem (19) and its prodrug sulopenem etzadroxil (20) (PF-03709270) from Pfizer [139]. Iterum are now evaluating 19 using IV administration followed by oral dosing of 20 in phase-III studies for the treatment of cIAI (NCT03358576) and cUTI (NCT03357614) and oral 20 alone for uUTI (NCT03354598). In these trials, sulopenem etzadroxil (19) is administered along with probenecid (21) [140], which is a marketed drug for gout and hyperuricemia that increases uric acid production, that inhibits the tubular secretion of some \u03b2-lactams and leads to a longer drug half-life and higher serum concentrations [141] (Table 3, Figs. 6 and 7).",

Murepavadin (22) has a new mode of action through binding to the N-terminal of the \u03b2-barrel protein LptD (Imp/OstA) from P. aeruginosa [142, 145], which affects lipopolysaccharide transport to the cell surface and leads to bacterial death [146].

In March 2017, Infectex announced positive results from a phase-II/III trial for the treatment of MDR pulmonary TB [151, 152], but since then there has been no update. Results from a Sequella-sponsored phase-II trial evaluating high range oral doses of rifampicin, moxifloxacin and SQ109 (23) for treating TB (NCT01785186) has been published [153]. Although SQ109 (23) is structurally derived from ethambutol, SQ109 (23) has different modes of action and activity against other bacteria and parasites. Ethambutol targets arabinofuranosyl transferases EmbA and EmbB [154, 155], which are involved in cell wall synthesis, and was recently reported to show synergy with isoniazid targeting a transcriptional repressor of the inhA gene [156] and glutamate racemase (MurI) [157].

The Innovative Medicines for Tuberculosis (iM4TB) Foundation (Lausanne, Switzerland) is leading the development in the rest of the world and are currently evaluating oral dosing of macozinone (47) in a phase-I trial (NCT03776500). Macozinone (47) is a second generation BTZ043 (48; Fig. 8) analog, which had potent in vitro activity against TB but suboptimal in vivo efficacy, that has enhanced physico-chemical properties [267]; however, macozinone (47) still has relatively poor solubility, which could affect oral bioavailability [268]. The nitro group present BTZs is reduced in vivo and the reactive nitroso intermediate forms a covalent semi-mercaptal adduct with cysteine-387 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis decaprenylphosphoryl\u2010\u03b2\u2010D\u2010ribose (DPR) 2\u2032\u2010oxidase (DprE1), which is an essential enzyme used to cell wall synthesis [269\u2013271]. Macozinone (47) has activity against a range of Mycobacterium species but resistance can arise through amino acid polymorphism of cysteine-387 [271, 272]. It has been recently shown that macozinone (47) and BTZ043 (48) can be de-aromatized in vivo through formation of a Meisenheimer complex, which could also reduce their in vivo half-lives [273].",

The replacement of the 3-hydroxyoctanoate group with an acetate leads to a significant reduction in antibacterial activity, while maintaining Lipid A binding in a similar way to polymyxin nonapeptide; the combination of these effects leads to strong synergisms and enhanced G-ve activity of several antibacterials [290\u2013293].",

Clofazimine (64) has been used to treat leprosy since 1962 and has more recently been incorporated into short-course MDR-TB regimens [330, 331]; however, clofazimine (64) has suboptimal PK/PD that leads to tissue accumulation, which due to its red color causes skin discoloration that can take months to clear. TBI-166 (63) was designed to have improved PK/PD properties, while maintaining potent anti-TB activity with less skin discoloration [332, 333].",

The \u201cmacro\u201d mode of action classes (e.g., cell wall inhibitors) are further divided into structure classes (e.g., \u03b2-lactam), which and sometimes further into structure sub-classes (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams).

Fifteen of these compounds have new structure classes and/or new mode of action of the well-established \u201cmacro\u201d targets: cell wall (9), DNA (5) and protein synthesis inhibition (1). There are no new RNA synthesis inhibitors in clinical development. There are no new BLI classes in development after the recent approvals of the DBO (avibactam, 2015) and boronate classes (vaborbactam, (12), 2017). The ADC DSTA4637S (66) was not classified as a new pharmacophore as the payload is a rifamycin derivative; however, if approved, it would be a first antibacterial ADC alongside and would add to the three approved mAbs, raxibacumab, obiltoxaximab, and bezlotoxumab (Table 1).",

Oral administration is the most predominate route (27) with just under 50% (13) being 13 TB clinical candidates, for which oral administration route is almost mandatory. The second highest category is iv administration with 17, while there are six candidates that use iv/po; the iv/po switch strategy is used when patients move from iv administration in intensive care to oral afterwards. Eight of the 15 iv administered drugs are derived from NP lead, which is not unexpected due their physico-chemical properties [21, 380]. The po topical (5) administration route is used to treat for gastrointestinal infections, such as C. difficile and H. pylori. For po topical, the clinical candidates are taken orally as tablets, but are not significantly systemically absorbed; this contrasts with po administered compounds that are taken orally but pass through the gut and into blood for delivery throughout the body. Interestingly, one of the CDI clinical candidates, DNV-3837 (44) is being developed using iv administration, which differentiates it to the other five CDI clinical candidates in development and marketed drugs that use the po topical route. Finally, there are three topical delivered candidates that can be delivered as creams and eye drops.",

It is likely that this increase in phase-I candidates has been helped by increased funding and the development expertise offered by organizations like the Wellcome Trust (London, UK), BARDA (Washington DC, USA), GARDP (Geneva, Switzerland), CARB-X (Boston, MA, USA) and the Novo Holdings\u2019s REPAIR Impact Fund (Copenhagen, Denmark), as well as funding provided for the development of new anti-Mycobacterium drugs by organizations such as the TB Alliance (New York, NY, USA) and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Seattle, WA, USA). However, despite this increase, there are also some unmet medical needs that need to be addressed in the clinical pipeline: new antibacterials with activity against \u03b2-metallolactamases, orally administered that have broad spectrum G\u2212ve activity, and new treatments for MDR Acinetobacter and gonorrhea.
