In order to examine effects of an individual movement and spatial control measures on a disease outbreak, we developed a multiscale model and extended the semi-stochastic simulation method by linking individual movements to pathogen's diffusion, linking the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding/excretion at the individual level. Numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and, in particular, individuals' rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number R 0 , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak. It is interesting that a high level of aggregation the individuals' movement results in low new infections and a small final size of the infected population. Further, we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals, indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene. We found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy, and in particular, an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak, compared with local measures, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control.",

Moreover, between-host disease transmission is generally dependent on the within-host viral loads, and vice versa. Also, different enteroviral serotypes greatly influence the between-host transmission. A number of mathematical models of infectious diseases have been studied extensively by employing single-scale-based models at the immunological or epidemiological scales (Anderson and May 1991; Nowak and May 2000; Diekmnann and Heesterbeek 2000) . The immunological models focus on the within-host immune viral dynamics at the individual level, while the epidemiological models focus on the between-host transmission dynamics at the population level. Availability of big data at various levels and emergence of unanswered questions enable novel methods of mathematical models to connect within-host immune viral dynamics with the between-host epidemiological transmission of infectious diseases.",

Furthermore, the mechanisms and processes (transmission, replication, pathogen shedding, infection) for infectious disease systems can be modeled for each hierarchical level. These can then be coupled via bridges between the microscale and the macroscale, leading to similar categories of multiscale models which include individual-based multiscale models (IMSMs), nested multiscale models (NMSMs), embedded multiscale models (EMSMs) and hybrid multiscale models (HMSMs) (Garira 2017 (Garira , 2018 Feng et al. 2012; Murillo et al. 2013; Gandolfi et al. 2014; Yu and Bagheri 2016) . Agent(individual)-based models (ABMs or IBMs) are particularly well suited to characterize biological phenomena in a multiscale, multiclass manner. In particular, they can simulate ensembles of individual hosts in time and space, represent detailed information on epidemic states and contribute to our understanding of disease pathology and epidemiology (Sun et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 2009 ).",

Hence, stochastic simulation algorithms are used for the individuals' dynamics and numerical method for the deterministic PDE equation is then applied to the variation amongst the free-living pathogens.

The results reveal that the individuals' movement speed V 0 plays an important role in affecting the spread of infectious diseases. It shows that as the movement speed increases, the average R 0 will gradually increase. Note that when the moving speed is very low, for example V 0 = 0.01, the average R 0 is less than that for the classic SIR model without movement. That is because we assume that the infected individuals can only infect the susceptibles around them rather than all possible susceptibles. Thus, when the moving speed is very low, the neighborhood of infected people may not have a sufficient number of susceptibles. However, as the speed increases, i.e., the individuals' aggregation is so fast that more susceptible individuals could be within the radius of an infected individual, resulting in an increase in mean R 0 and eventually the reproduction number mediated by individuals' movement may be greater than that for the model without movement. Further, it follows from Table 1 that the higher the velocity V 0 is, the higher the final size, the higher the peak value and the earlier that the outbreak peaks. A relatively slow movement may result in multiple outbreaks, while quick movements lead to a single peak being more likely. Case B: Effect of the radius of spatial infection r on disease specifics Note that the cluster radius could influence the individual behavior during the movement. In the following, we investigate variation in disease specifics with r for fixed velocity V 0 = 0.05, and list outcomes in Table 2 . It follows that increasing the cluster radius r gradually decreases the average R 0 , while the impacts of r on the final size, peak time and peak value seem to be non-monotonic and exhibit more complex patterns, which reveals that small variations in the cluster radius could result in significant changes in those indicators.",

It follows that increasing the weight parameter \u03c3 greatly increases the average R 0 , while the impacts of \u03c3 on the final size, peak time and peak value exhibit non-monotonic and more complex patterns, indicating that small variations in parameter \u03c3 , associated with the level of following herd behavior, could result in significant changes in those indicators. This means that the lower the bandwagon effect is (i.e., the greater \u03c3 ) the more new infections there are, which is because more individuals move in their own ways such that the infected individuals move to the wider areas and may infect more other susceptibles.",

Note that here the total number of infected people may not reach the critical size I c for some simulations, and consequently control measures are not triggered at all. Another possible extreme case is that some infected individuals may not infect any susceptible individual during the whole simulation process, then we do not consider those extreme scenarios when we calculate the control reproduction number R c 0 . Figure 3 shows the effects of threshold level I c and initial data I 0 on the mean R c 0 and other epidemic specifics. It follows from Fig. 3a that for a given initial data I 0 , the R c 0 shows the decline trend as I c increases, which implies that the later the control strategy implements (greater value of I c ) the lower the number of new infections (the lesser R c 0 ). It seems unreasonable that early implementation of strategies induces more new infections. Bearing in mind that this isolation strategy does not only isolate the infected individuals but also the susceptibles who are within the cluster radius of the isolated infected individual. Then early implementation of control strategies usually brings about the clustering of outbreaks in local areas, and consequently induces more new infections, which was observed during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza (Tang et al. 2010 ) when the Fengxiao strategy was implemented. Further, it shows that the mean R c 0 in Case 4 is larger than that for Case 3 for all threshold levels I c , which implies that if the individuals in the isolation area can move slowly, then the mean reproduction number R c 0 is greater than that for the case in which the individual cannot move.",

In particular, Figs. 10, 11 and 12 in \"Appendix\" show that the spatial heterogeneity becomes stronger when more infected individuals are introduced, then the isolated areas are distributed more broadly, and consequently more new infections are obtained (meaning greater mean value of R c 0 ).

In this study, we develop an algorithm to simulate how individuals transmit infectious diseases to others and may release pathogens into the environment while moving, and vice versa these free-living pathogens can further infect individuals while dispersing, e.g., MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and MRAB (multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) transmissions in hospital infections (Wang et al. 2012 (Wang et al. , 2015 Wang and Tang 2017) . We link individual random movements to pathogen's continuous diffusion, link the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding/excretion at the individual level, in order to examine effects of the individuals' movements, pathogen's diffusion and spatial control measures on the disease outbreak. It is a systematic analysis of the effects of individual random walk in space, pathogen's diffusion, disease transmission (directly or indirectly via the pathogen) and threshold control policy on the transmission of infectious diseases.",

This indicates that the more the bandwagon effect is (i.e., the lower \u03c3 ) the fewer the new infections, which is because more individuals get together such that disease transmission becomes difficult due to lack of susceptibles.",

It seems reasonable that strengthening diffusion increases disease transmission and hence is harmful for disease control, as suggested by our results and by the recent work on SEIR-type model reaction-diffusion model (Song et al. 2019) . The disagreement on effect of diffusion on R 0 between our result and previous works is because individuals movement in our simulation has a kind of direction and is also mediated by population's movement direction, rather than random diffusion represented by the reaction-diffusion equations.",

This indicates that the earlier the control strategy is implemented (lower value of I c ) the more new infections there are (the more R c ), which is in agreement with results of Tang et al. (2010) in which an early Fengxiao strategy induced more local A/H1N1 cases. That is because this early local strategy may lead to aggregated outbreaks within the isolated areas. Moreover, the more the initial infected individuals are introduced (the greater I 0 ), the stronger the spatial heterogeneity is when control is implemented, and hence the more new infections there are. This indicates that high level of spatial heterogeneity of seeded infection is a risk factor that induces new infections and large outbreak.",

We found that either a high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance leads the total number of infected individuals to decline, which implies that air movement and frequent cleaning are beneficial for mitigating an outbreak. We further investigated the effect of a uniform isolation strategy on disease outbreaks and obtained that with frequent clearance of the environment a large size of the uniform isolation region results in a small final size, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of environment is beneficial for disease control. By comparing the local and uniform isolation strategies, we obtained that the uniform isolation strategy leads to lower values of IFN, and peaks, suggesting the advantages of the uniform isolation (or large-scale isolation) strategy.",

Some interesting and realistic conclusions, especially the efficacy of various control strategies on disease infection, were suggested. However, it is challenging to test the control measures by specific diseases due to lack of reliable data on the concentration of pathogen with/without diffusion, and we leave this for future work. We note also that our transmission simulation is based on a neighbor principle, that is, an infected individual can only infect susceptible individuals within a certain radius, which is a reasonable but ignoring contact network structure. Meanwhile we acknowledge that complex contact network structure greatly influences on disease infection (Sun et al. 2018; Xiao et al. 2011; Shirley and Rushton 2005) and we leave this for future research. We introduce the transition layer n + 1/2, there are two steps from n to n + 1: For the first step, from n to n +1/2, we use an implicit difference scheme in the x direction and an explicit difference scheme in the y direction.

For the diffusion term, we use the ADI (alternating-direction implicit) method to solve the diffusion equation. The ADI scheme provides a feasible method for solving the parabolic equations in 2-spatial dimensions by using tri-diagonal matrices. To do this, each time increment is executed in two steps.In order to solve the diffusive-bacteria model, we first mesh the region. Considering a two-dimensional square space L \u00d7 L, and the time is T .
