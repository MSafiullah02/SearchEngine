However, there has been no consensus on the nomenclature of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) from the perspective of traditional Chines Medicine (TCM) so far. Academician Tong Xiaolin suggested that the disease should be named as cold-dampness pestilence (\u5bd2\u6e7f\u75ab) [1] , and academician Wang Qi called the disease pulmonary pestilence (\u80ba\u761f) in the Manual for Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment of NCP [2] . In general, there is an agreement on the opinion that NCP belongs to the category of epidemic disease (\u75ab\u75c5) in TCM. As the special climate of Wuhan, where the local temperature in last winter was higher than that in previous winter, and the rainfall was more frequent than snowfall, the syndromes of NCP patients often presented the characteristics of dampness pathogen ( \u6e7f\u90aa) in TCM. Integrating the analysis resulted from Professor Liu Qingquan and Dr. Xiang Qiong [3, 4] , we consider that NCP should be defined as dampness toxin pestilence (\u6e7f\u6bd2\u75ab). Dampness toxin ( \u6e7f\u6bd2) runs through the comprehensive pathology of NCP.

Pestilent Qi is prone to encroaching specific organs and involving multiple organs failure, and commonly breaks out in populated large cities.

As NCP belongs to the category of epidemic disease, the pathogen is generally attributed to dampness toxin according to the main symptom characteristics of this disease. TCM believes that NCP locates in lung, and is closely related to spleen and stomach, and its pathological changes involve in heart, liver and kidney in the later stages. Dampness pathogen can change into cold-dampness (\u5bd2\u6e7f) pathogen following the Yin body constitution (\u9634\u6027\u4f53\u8d28), and also become the dampness-heat (\u6e7f\u70ed) pathogen following the Yang body constitution (\u9633\u6027\u4f53\u8d28). Clinical observation shows that dampness toxin can directly invade into middle energizer (\u4e2d\u7126) in partly NCP patients, and leads to the dysfunction of Qi movement. If the treatment method is appropriate and sufficient healthy Qi (\u6b63\u6c14) gradually recovers, the pathogen will be driven out, consequently the patient will enter into the recovery period. At the same time clinical manifestations appear some symptoms of Qi and Yin deficiency (\u6c14\u9634\u4e24\u865a\u8bc1). Thus, the pathological evolution of NCP in TCM can be summarized as dampness toxin invading defense exterior (\u536b\u8868) in early stage, and then enters the lungs and influences spleen function, eventually involves heart, liver and kidney, which causes Yang Qi collapse (\u9633\u6c14\u5916\u8131) by excess pathogen and Yin and Yang separates from each other (\u9634\u9633\u79bb\u51b3).

Some scholars have suggested that TCM pathogenesis of NCP is related to the \"lung-spleen-large intestine\" dysfunction [10, 16, 17] . It has been discovered that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharide (HCP), a Chinese herbal medicine extract from Houttuynia cordata Thunb. can keep the intestinal homeostasis in H1N1 virus-infected mice, and protect the intestinal wall barrier, inhibit IL-1\u03b2 production mediated by Toll receptors, and improve the expression of IL-10, suggesting that the effect of antiinflammatory damage is related to regulation of intestinal microbiota. As a main active ingredient of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and Coptis chinensis Franch., Berberine's bioavailability and in vivo metabolism are found to have close relationship with intestinal organic acids and microbiota [18, 19] . The doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair in TCM theory is similar to the Gut-lung axis in the theory of modern medicine. The most frequently used CMs for NCP patients in our study also suggests channel tropism (\u5f52\u7ecf) of numerous CMs belongs to lung, spleen, stomach and intestine. Therefore, CMs can achieve the purpose of relieving and curing lung diseases by adjusting the intestinal microenvironment balance. Moreover, it is not only one of the mechanisms of Chinese medicine treatment for NCP, but also one important approach to screen novel Chinese medicines for treating NCP in the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 893, "end": 897, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 898, "end": 901, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathological mechanism of anti-NCP TCM"}, {"text": "The network pharmacology results in this study indicated that the recommended formulas in five disease stages have both generality and individuality in the compound level, in which compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., all are involved in the treatment of multi-stages of the disease.
