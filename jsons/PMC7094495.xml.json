S is a type I transmembrane protein and can be described as having two functional regions: the N-terminal receptor binding region (S1) and the C-terminal membrane fusion region (S2).6 The receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)7 and the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 318\u2013510), located within S1, has been shown to be sufficient for ACE2 binding.8, 9 The X-ray crystal structure of the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex has been determined and the structure shows that within the RBD, a large loop, called the receptor binding motif (RBM, residues 424\u2013494), mediates all of the contacts with ACE2.10 In addition, the structure provides insight into the role played by RBD residues thought to be important in the cross-species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV.",

The structure reveals that the RBD surface recognized by F26G19 overlaps significantly with the surface recognized by ACE2. As such, the structure suggests a mechanism of neutralization in which antibody bound to the RBD blocks the binding of SARS-CoV to the host cell. Moreover, the complex provides further support for the continued development of the RBD as a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate.",

The RBD is composed of a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet core and the RBM, the extended ACE2-binding loop that includes a small two-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet and three short \u03b1-helices. As in the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex, RBD residues 318\u2013322 and 502\u2013510 are disordered and are not observed in the electron density maps. The RBD contains three disulfide-bonded pairs of cysteine residues: Cys323/Cys348, Cys366/Cys419, and Cys467/Cys474. Notably, the RBD fragment used in determining the X-ray crystal structure of the Fab m396\u2013RBD complex22 was composed of residues 317\u2013518 and that structure shows that Cys511, a residue not included in the 318\u2013510 fragment used here, forms a disulfide bond with Cys378. The additional disulfide bond serves to immobilize the C-terminus of the RBD, resulting in the completion of a short three-stranded \u03b2-sheet, and electron density for residues 502\u2013512 is observed in the Fab m396-RBD complex. The 318\u2013510 fragment was also used in determining the structure of the free RBD; in that structure the RBD was found to form a dimer in the crystal lattice.25 However, it should be noted that the native Cys378/Cys511 disulfide bond and the associated formation of the short three-stranded \u03b2-sheet is not structurally compatible with the observed dimer. We see no propensity for the 318\u2013510 fragment to form dimers as determined by gel\u2013filtration chromatography analysis at \u223c 10\u2013100 \u03bcM concentration.",

Both asparagine side chains point away from the RBD\u2013Fab interface (see Fig. 3), and we have shown that carbohydrate does not interfere with binding; the affinity of the F26G19 Fab for the glycosylated (K\nd\n = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M) and the deglycosylated RBD (K\nd\n = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M) is very similar, as measured by BIAcore analysis (data not shown).

It is the residue most deeply buried on complex formation (Fig. 2) and it is found near the centre of the interface. It sits in a pocket formed by the side chains of several VH residues and Tyr494 of the RBD. On complex formation, 114 \u00c52 of Ile489 is buried by CDR H1 Arg33, CDR H2 Tyr52, and CDR H3 Glu95/Ile97/Gln99. With the exception of this interaction, the only other side-chain interactions involving residues of the 486\u2013492 loop are the weak hydrogen bonds that Tyr491 and Gln492 make with CDR L1 Tyr32 (3.1 \u00c5) and CDR L3 Tyr94 (3.2 \u00c5), respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, hydrogen-bond interactions with the backbone of the loop appear to be much more important in complex formation. The backbone NH groups of loop residues 488\u2013490 each donate hydrogen bonds to functional groups on the Fab (Fig. 2). In addition, the carbonyl oxygen of loop residue Thr486 accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH of CDR L3 Tyr94. Also notable is loop residue Gly488, which along with Ile489 sits in a groove in the Fab that accommodates these two residues (Fig. 2). The C\u03b1 atom of Gly488 points into the surface of the Fab and mutation to any other residue type would be expected to disrupt the F26G19-RBD complex.",

In fact, the overlap between these two surfaces is accounted for entirely by residues 486\u2013491 and corresponds to 35% of the RBD surface buried by ACE2. In addition, nearly the entire volume of the VL domain in the antibody complex occupies the same volume occupied by ACE2 in the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex (Fig. 4\n). Thus, the ability of F26G19 to neutralize SARS-CoV infectivity likely stems from a direct competition between the antibody and ACE2 for binding to the RBD. Consistent with this suggestion is our BIAcore data, which show that the affinity of the F26G19 Fab for the RBD (K\nd\n = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M) is comparable to the affinity of ACE2 for S1 (K\nd\n = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u2212 9 M).23 Two other neutralizing antibody fragments, Fab m396 and scFv 80R, which have been shown to compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD,22, 23, 25 have also been shown to bind with high affinity (2.0 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M for the RBD and 3.2 \u00d7 10\u2212 8 M for S1, respectively). Remarkably, RBD residues 486\u2013491 were also found to be a key determinant of recognition by Fab m396.22 This antibody fragment, which exhibits a broad neutralizing activity for several different strains of SARS-CoV,31 was selected from a na\u00efve human library for its ability to bind to the RBD and was not elicited by an immune response to virus. In the Fab m396\u2013RBD complex, the loop is even more extensively buried with 10 residues (482\u2013491) constituting 51% of the total surface area buried by the antibody fragment. As shown in Fig. 4, the loop is also buried in the cleft formed between VH and VL in the Fab m396\u2013RBD complex; however, the antibody fragment is rotated approximately 180\u00b0 relative to that seen in the F26G19\u2013RBD complex. Nevertheless, even though the relative positions of the heavy and light chains of the Fabs are \u201cswapped\u201d in the two complexes, the volumes occupied by the Fabs are very similar (Fig. 4). The nonimmune 80R antibody was also isolated from a human library derived from unimmunized donors and it exhibits potent neutralizing activity against the Tor2 and Urbani strains of SARS-CoV.23, 31 The X-ray crystal structure of the 80R scFv in complex with the RBD25 shows that although the 486\u2013492 loop is not buried as extensively as it is in the F26G19 and m396 complexes, the Fab overlaps even more fully with the volume occupied by ACE2 in the RBD\u2013ACE2 complex (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "Antibody-mediated neutralization of enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV is likely explained by a multihit model in which many, if not all, of the spike proteins on the virus surface are bound by antibody.32, 33, 34, 35 In fact, it has been proposed that the only requirement for neutralization is that the virus surface be coated with antibody so as to sterically prevent host cell attachment and/or membrane fusion.32, 34 It follows then that high-affinity antibodies such as F26G19, which compete directly for receptor binding, should be the most potent. Experimental support for this suggestion stems from a study of three influenza virus neutralizing antibodies, which showed that the two antibodies that bound the viral hemagglutinin and blocked sialic acid binding required a lower antibody\u2013hemagglutinin ratio to block the virus\u2013host cell interaction.36, 37 Like F26G19, the antibody fragments m396 and 80R also compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD.22, 23, 25 This, coupled with the fact that they both bind the RBD with high affinity although they are from antibody libraries derived from unimmunized donors, presumably explains their ability to potently neutralize infectivity.22, 25 The observation that some SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies do not compete with ACE2 for RBD binding21, 38 nevertheless shows that direct competition is not necessarily required for antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Given that SARS-CoV binds the large (723 amino acids) globular domain of membrane-bound ACE2, it follows that the RBD is either relatively exposed on the viral surface or that it becomes exposed during the process of host cell binding. Support for the former is provided for by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of SARS-CoV39 and the SARS-CoV\u2013ACE2 complex,40 which show that the S1 region of the trimeric S protein is exposed like the blades of a propeller and that each monomer of the trimer binds to an ACE2 molecule. Since F26G19 and ACE2 occupy overlapping volumes when bound to the RBD (Fig. 4), it follows that antibodies such as F26G19 would be equally well accommodated by each monomer of the native trimer found on the viral membrane. Since these reconstructions also show that the ACE2 molecules point away from the viral membrane along the long axis of the trimer, antibodies bound to the RBD would be well disposed to sterically block interactions with the cell surface. Further support for the suggestion that the RBD is readily accessible on the viral surface stems from the fact that the neutralizing antibodies m396 and 80R are also presumably accommodated, although the way they interact with the RBD would place the Fc domain and the \u201cother\u201d Fab arm of the immunoglobulin in locations different from that of F26G19. The presumed exposure of the SARS RBD and its high affinity for the large ACE2 receptor have been the subject of previous discussion and it has been suggested that this may reflect a virus that has yet to evolve to evade the immune system or one that favors rapid transmission over immune escape.5, 41 Consistent with this suggestion is the critical role played by Ile89 in F26G19 binding. This surface-exposed residue is not involved in ACE2 binding and its mutation would presumably lead to escape from F26G19-like antibodies. The exposure of the RBD may also explain why the monomeric RBD is a good vaccine candidate even though the S protein is trimeric.19 Owing to the separation of the RBDs in the native trimer, antibody interactions presumably involve only one subunit (as with the ACE2 interaction) and, as such, the monomeric RBD would conceivably elicit the same neutralizing antibodies that it would in the context of the trimer. This property is to be contrasted with that seen for both the influenza virus hemagglutinin and HIV gp120/41, where the trimeric state of the viral fusion protein is critical for eliciting a good neutralizing antibody response.42, 43\n",

            "text": "Carbohydrate is another means by which viruses limit the exposure of their RBDs to protect themselves from eliciting receptor-blocking antibodies, although it seems that this strategy is not employed by SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV S protein possesses 23 N-linked oligosaccharide sites, 3 of which are in the RBD, and analysis shows that those in the RBD are clustered toward one end of the domain distant from the ACE2 binding site (see Fig. 3). As such, these carbohydrates would not be expected to affect ACE2 binding. Indeed, our BIAcore measurements show that F26G19 binds the glycosylated and the deglycosylated RBD with essentially the same affinity. The fact that the RBD does not possess carbohydrate in the immediate vicinity of the ACE2 binding site is in contrast with that found in other viruses. In the case of HIV gp120/41, for example, carbohydrate is found to ring the CD4 binding site,42, 44 thereby greatly reducing the likelihood of eliciting an antibody whose footprint partially overlaps with that of the receptor binding surface. Only 46% of the F26G19 footprint on the RBD overlaps with that of the ACE2 footprint and, as such, there is RBD surface area (54%) available for the acquisition of N-linked oligosaccharides that would block F26G19 antibody binding but not ACE2 binding. The fact that there is more than one type of neutralizing antibody (i.e., antibodies that do not compete with each other for RBD binding) that can compete with ACE2 binding21, 38 further suggests that multiple regions adjacent to the ACE2 binding site are accessible for antibody binding. The F26G19 Fab covers only 35% of the RBD surface buried by ACE2, and partial overlap would presumably be sufficient for other neutralizing antibodies that compete directly with ACE2 binding. That carbohydrate does not ring the ACE2 binding site on the RBD may well support the suggestion that the observed RBD\u2013ACE2 interaction, mediated as it is through the RBM, is a recent acquisition.5, 45 Nevertheless, it should be noted that the presence of carbohydrate on the RBD is not without consequence. The fully glycosylated RBD gives a higher neutralizing antibody titre than that of the deglycosylated form, an effect attributed to a reduction in antibodies directed against nonneutralizing epitopes.19\n",

The resulting pPA-TEV-RBD vector was linearized and HEK-293T cells grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/l aprotinin were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Stably transformed cell lines were selected and cloned using 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin. Protein production was scaled up in a Celligen 2.2-l New Brunswick bioreactor using the basket impeller containing 30 g of FibraCel disks (New Brunswick, M11769984). Once the culture was established, CHO-S-SFM-II medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum, 2.25 g/l glucose, 1\u00d7 nonessential amino acids, 1 mg/l aprotinin, and 1\u00d7 penicillin\u2013streptomycin was supplied in perfusion mode at \u223c 3\u20134 l/day for 15 days. The harvested medium was concentrated 10-fold and the protein A\u2013RBD fusion protein was purified by IgG Sepharose affinity chromatography. The fusion protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 3.0) and the protein A tag was removed by overnight TEV protease digestion at 4 \u00b0C using a TEV\u2013protein A-RBD ratio of 1:6 (w/w). The RBD was further purified by phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction and Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. N-linked oligosaccharides were removed by overnight peptide\u2013N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion at a PNGase F\u2013RBD ratio of 3:1(w/w) in 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 7% glycerol, 120 mM NaCl, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 \u00b0C. The deglycosylated RBD was further purified by Q-Sepharose ion-exchange and Superdex 200 gel-filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. Both the glycosylated and the PNGase F-treated RBD existed solely as monomers when analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography at concentrations between \u223c 10 and 100 \u03bcM.",
