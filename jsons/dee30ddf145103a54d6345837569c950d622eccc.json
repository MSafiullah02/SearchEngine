Rheumatology professionals care for patients with diseases that have a high risk of morbidity and mortality and manage rare dis eases; a global collaboration enables these professionals to collect enough data to inform clinical decisions. The sharing and dissemination of information about the diagnosis and management of rheumatic dis eases worldwide is important at all times, but is especially crucial during these uniquely uncharted times. Rheumatologists are managing a new threat, but the development of tools, such as telehealth platforms and opensource algorithms, can help inform strategies for global educa tion and communication within the rheumatology community beyond the COVID19 threat. We believe that the global community created in this dire time has the power and",

The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caught the attention of the medical community and the world at large. A local out break of a respiratory illness was first reported to WHO on Dec 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), and the resulting disease is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). 1 The virus spread quickly throughout China, and subsequently the world. At the time of the ACR session in November, 2019, noone could have imagined the global pandemic that is now unfolding.",

Few data on this possible risk exist to date; at the time of this Correspondence being published, there is a regis tered retrospective study in China for patients with rheumatic disease and a case series from the USA listing rheumatic disease as a preadmission comorbidity. 3 As studies regard ing treatments for and outcomes of COVID19 emerge, it seems pos sible that immunomodulation could alter the disease course of COVID19.",

The alliance was developed and publicised through social media, email listservs, and personal and professional networks. Within 48 h of inception, the COVID19 Global Rheumatology Alliance had engaged rheumatologists across six continents; support from non profit organisations promoting the health of patients with rheumatic diseases and major rheumatology journals followed soon after, with approximately 100 organisations endorsing the alliance at the time of this Correspondence. The COVID19 Alliance will obtain data on any patient with rheumatic disease who tests positive for SARSCoV2, capturing the range from mild to severe cases, with the goal of informing risk and best practice during the outbreak. With this novel pathogenic threat, there is much that is not yet known, and many ways this virus could impact the rheumatology community (panel). commitment to remain unified when the pandemic has passed.
