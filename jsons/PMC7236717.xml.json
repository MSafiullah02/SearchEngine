As a practicing Head and Neck Surgeon, and a teaching Faculty at a premium cancer centre in the southern part of India, looking into issues discussed in both the articles on a daily basis, I believe that the following discussion would be worthwhile.",

As we gained momentum after a major lockdown besides sending nasopharygeal swabs of the patients admitted for elective surgery for COVID -19 RT PCR , with a combination strategy of enhanced usage of HME perioperatively and HME incorporated stoma filters post operatively , appropriate levels of personal protection of health workers and sanitization measures we have been managing post laryngectomy follow ups effectively. On a personal basis, I had to attend to 3 voice prosthesis users in the outpatient department during the COVID-19 days, 2 post laryngectomy patients and 3 emergency post tracheostomy patients[3] in the ward. First voice prosthesis patient had come twice earlier within a period of 2 weeks to the casualty with a history of ingested voice prosthesis (Fig. 1\n). With the 2nd ingestion, a specially designed, adequately sized, voice prosthesis with combined tracheal and oesophageal large flanges was inserted. The second patient has a leakage through the prosthesis, and he is reassured with conservative measures to contain the leakage till his next visit. The 3rd patient who coughed out his voice prosthesis is now on a Nasogastric tube to occlude the Tracheo-Esophageal(TE) fistula, and he awaits a sized voice prosthesis insertion. Among the tracheostomised patients, both permanent and temporary one (a post salvage laryngectomy long term follow up patient) had to be given CPR for a cardiorespiratory arrest.",
