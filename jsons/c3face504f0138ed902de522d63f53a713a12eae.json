With regard to antiviral events, signalling pathways that control induction of antiviral cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN a/b) are induced, providing a first line of defence to viral infections. One way to counteract these responses is the expression of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) that suppresses the IFN response by both, interfering with signalling inducers and mediators (Garcia-Sastre, 2004; Wolff et al., 2008) , and by inhibiting processing of cellular pre-mRNA (reviewed in Krug et al., 2003) . Thereby, the IFNa/b and cytokine induction is kept in a tolerable limit (reviewed in Hale et al., 2008a) . Based on these functions A/NS1 is primarily known as a signalling blocker. Influenza B viruses also express an NS1 (B/NS1). While A/NS1 and B/NS1 share less than 20% sequence identity, they fulfil similar but not identical functions. B/NS1 also acts as an IFN antagonist (Talon et al., 2000; Garcia-Sastre, 2004 ) and inhibits the IFN inducible protein kinase R (Dauber et al., 2004; . In contrast to A/NS1, B/NS1 is not capable to inhibit polyadenylation, splicing and nuclear export of cellular mRNA (Wang and Krug, 1996) .",

            "text": "The family of PI3Ks comprises three main classes (class IA and IB, II and III) according to their lipid substrate specificity, in vitro (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001) . The class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes consisting of a regulatory (p85) and an enzymatic subunit (p110). These kinases exhibit both protein kinase and lipid kinase activity (Dhand et al., 1994) . In mammalian cells three class IA catalytic (p110 a, b and d) and five regulatory (p85a, p85b, p55g, p55a and p50a) subunits are known (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005) . The p85 regulatory subunits can function as stabilizer and inhibitor of the p110 subunits (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005) . PI3K is activated, for example, by binding of the regulatory subunit p85 to autophosphorylated tyrosine-kinase receptors or G-protein coupled receptors (reviewed in Wymann and Pirola, 1998) (Fig. 1) . The major role of the kinase is to phosphorylate membrane phospholipids. Upon PI3K activation phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) is generated by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate in the membrane, which in turn functions as a second messenger through interaction with pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins such as Akt/PKB and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1 (Neri et al., 2002) .",

Thr308 is phosphorylated by 3\u2032-PDK that itself is a PI3K effector. For phosphorlyation of Ser473, different kinases were discussed. Recently, the mTOR kinase associated with rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) and the small Gb-like protein GbL have been identified to build the mTORC2 complex that is responsible for phosphorylation at Ser473 (Sarbassov et al., 2005) . Although Akt is not phoshorylated directly by PI3K, these posttranslational modifications occur strictly dependent on PI3K activity. Therefore, detection of phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 is commonly used to monitor the activation state of PI3K.

In general, PI3K regulates various cellular events, such as cell metabolism, proliferation and survival (reviewed in Neri et al., 2002; Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005) . Here, only some regulatory key players involved in PI3K signalling are discussed (Fig. 1) . A vivid cross-talk between PI3K/ Akt-mTOR and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling is crucial to regulate cell differentiation and survival (Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008) . Regulation of endocytosis and vesicular trafficking via Rac1 activation are further functions described for PI3K that are required for ligand internalization (Saeed et al., 2008) . PDK1 activates, in addition to Akt, several other AGC protein kinase family members (cAMP, cGMP, Ca 2+ -dependent), such as p70 S6 kinase and protein kinase C to control vesicular transport and translation (Kikani et al., 2005) . Regulation of apoptosis is also an important function ascribed to PI3K/Akt. Activated Akt has been reported to inactivate proapoptotic factors such as BAD, caspase-9 and glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b) by phosphorylation. Akt also acts as a co-regulator of transcription factors, such as NF-kB, leading to the synthesis of antiviral acting proteins, such as IFN regulatory factor I and MHC class I proteins or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) (Cooray, 2004) .",

Among the phosphatases, PTEN (phosphatase of tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is likely to be the most important enzyme to control the PI3K pathway activity (Fig. 1 ). PTEN harbours protein as well as lipid phosphatase activities. It dephosphorylates phosphoinositides in position 3\u2032 of the inositol ring (Maehama and Dixon, 1998) . The levels of PTEN and its activity are positively and negatively regulated on transcriptional, as well as on post-translational level by phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, oxidation and acetylation (reviewed in Tamguney and Stokoe, 2007) . The most prominent PI3K/Akt-induced feedback regulator is the mTOR kinase, which forms complexes with raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) -mTORC1 (Hara et al., 2002) and rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) -mTORC2 (Sarbassov et al., 2004) . Hyperphosphorylation of mTORC1, for exmaple, by loss of PTEN, results in repression of PI3K whereas inhibition of mTORC1 leads to PI3K activation (Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008) .",

Thus, the role of PI3K was studied in the context of survival during chronic and latent infections (Cooray, 2004) . The viral LMP1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus regulates B-cell survival, the viral E5 protein of Papillomavirus functions as an apoptosis supressor in epithelial cells and the viral HBx protein of Hepatitis B viruses inhibits TGF-b-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells (Cooray, 2004) .

HCV belongs to the family of Flaviviridae. The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome with positive orientation (Lemon et al., 2007) . Initially, the non-structural protein 5 A (NS5A) of HCV was shown to induce p85 phosphorylation by complex-formation with Grb2-associated binder 1 (He et al., 2002) , a substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor. These results have been extended by observations that NS5A directly binds to the src homology (SH) 3 domain of p85. Binding is mediated by a prolinerich motif in the NS5A protein and results in activation of the kinase (Street et al., 2004) . Investigation of downstream factors of Akt indicated a NS5A-induced regulation of the Forkhead transcription factor FKHR and GSK-3b and accumulation of cellular beta-catenin. This results in stimulation of beta-catenin-responsive transcription, which is probably involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (Street et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the induction of the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signalling upon HCV infection was reported to control cell survival, and thereby also determines apoptosis (Mannova and Beretta, 2005) .",

First, RSV was shown to regulate NF-kB-transcriptional activity dependent on PI3K/Akt. In addition, RSV infection caused enhanced apoptosis upon PI3K inhibition (Thomas et al., 2002) . Recent investigations showed that RSV decreases p53 expression, thereby extending survival of the infected cells (Groskreutz et al., 2007) . P53 is a tumour suppressor and induces expression of pro-apoptotic factors. The murine double minute protein 2 is a p53 antagonist, which is phosphorylated by Akt upon RSV infection and leads to p53 degradation (Groskreutz et al., 2007) .

These results corresponded with earlier findings that PI3K is involved in phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 in response to TLR3 engagement upon double-stranded RNA stimulation (Sarkar et al., 2004) . Interestingly, this occurred independent of the IRF-3 kinases, Tank-binding-kinase-1 or IkB kinase epsilon. Thus, it was suggested that coactivation of IRF-3 most likely is mediated by phosphorylation of a different target phosphorylation site on IRF-3 (Sarkar et al., 2004) . Consequently, these observations indicate for an alternative PI3K-dependent signalling mechanism besides the canonical RIG-I/Tank-bindingkinase-1/IkB kinase epsilon/IRF-3 signalling module that is required for full activation of IRF-3 in influenza virusinfected cells.",

Initially, it was not clear which cellular or viral components activate PI3K late in the infection cycle. First evidence on the activating mechanism resulted from observations that PI3K is barely activated at later stages of infection in cells infected with the deltaNS1 virus, a virus mutant that lacks the IFN antagonistic A/NS1 protein (Ehrhardt et al., 2006) . This was a surprising finding, as signalling pathways usually were found to be hyperactivated upon infection with deltaNS1. Hence, it was suggested that the A/NS1 protein acts as an efficient and broad signalling suppressor. The absence of PI3K activation in deltaNS1-infected cells led to the intriguing conclusion that A/NS1 itself may induce PI3Kmediated signalling (Ehrhardt et al., 2006) . This hypothesis was subsequently verified by four independent studies, which showed that the A/NS1 protein is required and sufficient for activation of the kinase (Hale et al., 2006; Ehrhardt et al., 2007a; Shin et al., 2007a; Zhirnov and Klenk, 2007) . Furthermore, it was demonstrated by different technical approaches that A/NS1 is complexed with the regulatory subunit p85, an event that probably leads to activation of PI3K (Hale et al., 2006; Ehrhardt et al., 2007a; Shin et al., 2007a) .",

The A/NS1 protein harbours two well-characterized functional domains (reviewed in Hale et al., 2008a ). An RNA binding domain is located within the N-terminal 73 amino acids (aa) and a so-called effector domain is located between the RNA binding domain and the last 20-30 aa in the C-terminus of the protein (Hale et al., 2008a) . Furthermore, three characteristic motifs common to well-known binding consensus sequences have been identified. Two polyproline-rich sequences PXXP are located at aa 164-167 and 213-216, representing putative binding motifs for SH3 domain proteins. One YXXXM motif similar to tyrosine-bearing SH2 binding motifs (YXXM) is located at aa 89-92 (Hale et al., 2008a) (Fig. 3) . SH2 and SH3 domains are common protein-protein interaction modules of signalling proteins, and are also present in the regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K. P85 harbours one tandem SH2 domain (SH2N, SH2C), which flank the inter-SH2 domain and one N-terminal SH3 domain (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005) (Fig. 3) .",

The viruses mutated at position tyrosine 89 (Y89F) formed smaller plaques and showed reduced virus propagation (Hale et al., 2006) . Shin et al. (2007b) demonstrated by GST-pull down assays that besides the SH2 binding motif at Y89, also the A. Influenza A virus NS1 encompasses up to 237 aa, depending on the strain. The RNA binding domain is located within the first 73 aa and three putative binding motifs (bm) for SH domains have been identified (SH2-bm, SH3-bm-1, SH3-bm-2) (presumed motifs for A/NS1 interaction with p85b or Crk/CrkL are depicted). The asterisk indicates the binding sequence responsible for interaction with the inter-SH2 domain (iSH2) domain of p85b. B. The regulatory subunit p85b encompasses 724 aa and harbours one N-terminal SH3 domain, two SH2 domains flanking the iSH2, one BH (Bcr/Rac GAP homology) domain and two proline-rich motifs (triangle) (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005) . Interaction of the N-terminal SH3 domain of p85b with A/NS1 was shown to be stronger than with the C-terminal SH2 domain. Recently, the iSH2 domain has been identified as additional interaction site for A/NS1, whereby the Valine 573 seems to be the most important aa responsible for interaction. SH3 binding motif of NS1 is required for p85 binding. In a subsequent study recombinant virus strains with mutations in the SH3 motif of A/NS1 were generated. This included proline replacements in the first SH3 binding domain at aa 164 and 167 and/or in the second domain at aa 212, 213 and 216 of A/NS1 (Shin et al., 2007b) . The mutant viruses displayed decreased replication fitness, smaller plaque size and the lack of Akt activation in the case of the aa 164-167 mutant (Shin et al., 2007b) . Further studies showed that the interaction is mainly mediated by the first SH3 motif in the A/NS1 protein (Shin et al., 2007a) .",

The kinase fulfils several functions in the infected cell (summarized in Fig. 2 ). An early and transient peak of activity is observed during viral attachment to cells. Later in the infection cycle the kinase is activated in a more persistent manner due to expression of the viral A/NS1 protein. With regard to the virus supportive function of PI3K, there is an early requirement of the kinase for efficient viral entry. Similar mechanisms have already been observed for Ebola virus infection (Saeed et al., 2008) . At later stages, PI3K seems to suppress premature apoptosis, most likely mediated by binding to the A/NS1 protein. Finally, the kinase also exhibits antiviral functions by regulating the IRF-3 transcription factor during type I IFN induction.",

The currently proposed model of A/NS1-induced PI3K activity suggests a complex-formation of p110/p85b-A/NS1, whereby A/NS1 disrupts the inhibiting interaction interface of p110 and p85b (Hale et al., 2008b; Li et al., 2008) . Nonetheless, the different interaction sites from A/NS1 and p85b described above (Fig. 3) are involved in PI3K induction, too (Hale et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2007a; .",

It may be hypothesized that PI3K is one of the factors that are activated by the virus-infected cell in a vRNA-dependent fashion to fight the invader, but is redirected by the pathogen to support replication via its A/NS1 protein. This may include uncoupling of PI3K from the antiviral RNA signalling response by keeping the kinase under control of a viral protein.",

A/NS1 is located predominantly in the nucleus and only accumulates in the cytoplasm at very late stages of the infection cycle. Nevertheless, cytoplasmic activities of A/NS1 have been described, including inhibition of the RNA sensor RIG-I or binding to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (Hale et al., 2008a) . In this context it is Influenza virus induced PI3K signalling 869 crucial to elucidate the sorting mechanisms of A/NS1. Other analysis may comprise additional interaction partners of A/NS1, such as Crk/CrkL and their regulation. A major challenge is also to unravel the activation mechanism and function of PI3K during virus entry. These approaches may help to expand our knowledge regarding the delicate balance between replication enhancing and host cell defence mechanisms.",
