The first PEDV whole-genome sequence was completed for the prototype strain CV777 in 2001 [1]. Since then, several PEDV strains have been sequenced and now over 170 whole-genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the whole-genome sequence, PEDV has been classified into two Genogroups\u20141 and 2\u2014which the variant and classical strains of US PEDV belong to, respectively [2].",

It was built using the standard database containing all Ref Seq bacteria and virus genomes along with all complete swine enteric coronavirus disease (SECD) genomes available at NCBI and a pig genome.Raw reads are run through an in-house custom shell script. In brief, 18 complete genomes from NCBI representing the 4 SECD virus species (TGEV, PRCV, PEDV, and PDCoV) are used as references to align raw reads. A function is looped 3\u00d7. This function aligns and removes duplicates, creates a VCF, updates reference with VCF information, and performs a BLAST search against the nt database using the updated reference. Eighteen complete genomes are used to start the initial loop. From this first loop the top hit returned is used as the reference for the next loop. A total of three loops are performed to find the best reference.After the best reference has been found, alignment metrics including read counts, mean depth of coverage, and percent of genome with coverage are collected.Reports summarizing the alignment metrics (Fig. 1) along with Kraken identification interactive Krona HTML file, a FASTA of assembled genome, and depth of coverage profile graph (Fig. 2) are e-mailed to concerned individuals.\n\nThe assembled FASTA file can be visually verified in IGV using the BAM and VCF output from the script.

File size and read counts for each fastq file are shown. Provided by Kraken, 223,955 virus reads were identified. \u201cReference used\u201d is the closest finding in the NCBI nt database. The read count shows the number of raw reads shown to match the reference. \u201cPercent cov\u201d shows the percent of reference having coverage. A coverage of 98.36 % for PEDV indicates a true find relative to the sporadic <51 % coverage seen from PRCV, although in this case, the presence of PRCV cannot be ruled out. There were no reads matching TGEV and PDCoV, which were not shown. Because of the high percent of genome coverage, the completed reference-guided assembly for PEDV was BLAST against the nt database to provide mismatches, e-value, and bit score against the most closely related publicly available genome",
