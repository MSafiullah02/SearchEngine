Current therapeutic strategies for CDI are insufficient, as they do not address the key role of the microbiome in preventing C. difficile spore germination into toxin-producing vegetative bacteria, which leads to symptomatic disease. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appears to reduce the risk of recurrent CDI through microbiome restoration. However, a wide range of efficacy rates have been reported, and few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, limiting our understanding of FMT efficacy and safety. We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting. We provide specific recommendations for future trial designs of FMT to provide improved quality of the clinical evidence to better inform treatment guidelines.",

C. difficile has a 2-phase life cycle with dormant spores germinating into toxinproducing vegetative bacteria, which leads to colitis [7] . Although the factors that initiate germination are incompletely understood, bile acids play an important role [6] . Primary bile acids, which are synthesized in the liver and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract, set up favorable conditions for germination. By contrast, secondary bile acids, the metabolic product of key commensal bacteria, inhibit vegetative bacterial growth [5] . These and other key microbe-derived metabolites are reduced when antibiotics kill innocent bystander bacteria, which are critical to these metabolic processes. For example, a relative increase of primary to secondary bile acid concentrations facilitates spore germination and vegetative outgrowth, leading to recurrence. Furthermore, CDItargeted antibiotics maintain and exacerbate this low-diversity microbiome (ie, dysbiosis) [8] . Thus, antibiotics are a main driver of compositional and functional microbiome changes and are insufficient as a sole therapeutic strategy, as microbiome recovery is essential for durable clinical resolution. Other potential mechanisms that inhibit C. difficile include niche exclusion, competition for nutrients, and bacteriocins [6] .",

CDI experts have hailed this trial as arguably the most rigorous in the field to examine the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention for acute CDI [34, 35] .
