            "text": "Since 1990 (Ellington and Szostak, 1990, Tuerk and Gold, 1990), it has been well-known that nucleic acid aptamers selected from a large pool of random sequences, instead of expensive antibodies produced from the sacrifice of small animals, can bind specifically to target molecules in a sample collected from human (Bock et al., 1992, Phan et al., 2005), food (Cruz-Aguado and Penner, 2008), and nature (Ueyama et al., 2002). For example, 15 nt thrombin aptamer (TBA, 5\u2032-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3\u2032) was developed to inhibit thrombin activity capable of converting fibrinogen into clottable fibrin in the hemostasis process (Bock et al., 1992). Studies with circular dichroism (CD) spectra (Pasternak et al., 2011), NMR (Kelly et al., 1996), and X-ray (Kelly et al., 1996, Padmanabhan et al., 1993) were confirmed that the shape of TBA bound with two anion binding recognition exosites of thrombin is G-quadruplex as shown in\nFig. 1(a). G-quadruplex was formed with two square planar structures. The square planar structure called a guanine tetrad was formed through hydrogen bonding between four guanines as shown in Fig. 1(b). A number of anti-parallel or parallel G-quadruplex aptamers were developed to bind and quantify a wide variety of target molecules such as ATP (Huizenga and Szostak, 1995), hemin (Travascio et al., 1998), HIVs (Phan et al., 2005), insulin (Yoshida et al., 2009), ochratoxin (Cruz-Aguado and Penner, 2008), potassium ions (Ueyama et al., 2002), Sars-CoV helicase (Shum and Tanner, 2008), and selerostin (Shum et al., 2011) in a sample. Using the characteristics of G-quadruplex DNA aptamers, currently, various types of aptasensors with chemiluminescence (Bi et al., 2010, Freeman et al., 2011, Freeman et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2012), colorimeter (Zhang et al., 2011), electrochemical (Yuan et al., 2011), or fluorescence (Yuanboonlim et al., 2012) detection have been developed.",

Based on the principle of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) as shown in Fig. 1(c), FITC excited by dim chemiluminescence generated from the reaction between G-rich single strand DNA and TMPG emitted bright green light (Yamasuji et al., 2011).

As shown in\nFig. 2(a), TBA-conjugated 6-FAM as well as TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of GO emit strong and glow chemiluminescent light with the addition of TPA and TMPG. Fig. 2(a) shows that the ratio between relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of GO was dependent on the measuring time of emission. The ratio determined with 100 s measurement was the smallest. The results shown in Fig. 2(a) indicate that G-rich TBAs immobilized on the surface of GO began to slowly react with TMPG. G-rich TBAs reacted with TMPG, which are not DNA aptamers, rapidly detached from GO. Then, they emitted strong CL emission through the chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) from a high-energy intermediate, formed from the reaction between guanine of TBA and TMPG, to 6-FAM (see Fig. S1). The possible CRET mechanism in guanine chemiluminescence reaction may be similar to chemically initiated electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) mechanism of peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence (Lee et al., 2002a, Lee et al., 2002b, Maruyama et al., 2013, Park et al., 2011).

The reaction of guanine chemiluminescence in the presence of 20 mM TPA was faster than those in the presence of other TPA concentrations.

Relative CL intensity and quenching ratio in 5% human serum were smaller than those in water. Also, the linear dynamic range (0.5\u20138 \u00b5g/ml) in 5% human serum was slightly narrow than that (0.25\u20138 \u00b5g/ml) in water as shown in Fig. 5(b). This is because 5% human serum contains interferences capable of reducing the sensitivity of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor. Normal range of thrombin in human blood is 50\u2013100 \u00b5g/ml (2.5\u20135 \u00b5g/ml in 5% human blood). Thus, we expected that G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor developed in this research can be applied to quantify thrombin in human blood. The limit of detection (LOD=background+3\u00d7 standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor to quantify thrombin in 5% human serum was 0.4 \u00b5g/ml (12.3 nM). The background of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor was the reciprocal of relative CL intensity measured in the absence of thrombin. LOD of G-quadruplex. TBA aptasensor developed in this research was similar to or lower than those of more complicated aptasensors (Goda and Miyahara, 2013, Jalit et al., 2012, Li et al., 2013) reported recently as shown in Table S2. Accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection were studied with three different samples in 5% human serum at room temperature. As shown in Table S3 the results were good within the acceptable error range.",

Based on the concept, we developed a cost-effective, rapid and simple G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with highly sensitive guanine chemiluminescence detection without expensive and intractable nanoparticles, including magnetic Fe3O4 GO nanoparticles, and complicated procedures. In conclusion, the results observed in this research indicate that various types of G-quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable of specifically sensing a target molecule such as ATP, HIV, ochratoxin, potassium ions, and thrombin can be developed. Thus, G-quadruplex DNA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection can be applied in various research areas such as bio-analytical chemistry, clinical chemistry, food safety, and toxicology.",
