In order to study the complexity of proteome, various proteomic techniques, including protein microarrays, have emerged during the past few years. A protein microarray provides a multiplex platform for high throughput (HT) studies. Two different strategies have been used for protein microarrays 1: (i) abundance based, where specific capture molecules such as antibodies and aptamers are spotted on the array or RP protein blots, where complex mixtures such as cell lysates are spotted and abundance of biomolecules are measured by antibodies; and (ii) function based, where purified proteins or proteins generated from cell\u2010free expression system are spotted on the array (Fig. 1). Protein microarrays have been successfully applied for protein\u2013protein interactions 2, cytokine detection 3, protein\u2013DNA interactions 4, kinase target identification 5, detection of various antigens and antibodies 6 as well as for biomarker discovery 7.",

Dynamic range, real\u2010time monitoring, multiplexing and HT capability, widespread applicability and data handling are other key determining factors 10, 11. In protein microarray experiments, signals can be detected by label\u2010based or label\u2010free strategies. Both the approaches have their merits and demerits. The label\u2010based detection methods require labelling of query molecules with fluorescent dyes, radioisotopes or epitope tags. Label\u2010based detection is widely used in protein microarrays due to the common availability of reagents and simple instrument requirements. However, these labelling strategies often alter surface characteristics and natural activities of the query molecule. Moreover, the labelling procedure is laborious, lengthy and limits the number and types of query molecules that can be studied 12. In contrast to the label\u2010based techniques, the label\u2010free detection methods depend on the measurement of an inherent property of the query itself, such as mass and dielectric property. Label\u2010free techniques avoid interference due to the tagging molecules, and determine reaction kinetics of biomolecular interactions in real\u2010time 6, 13.",

Quantum dots have been successfully introduced in biochemical and clinical research due to its ability to conjugate with different biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and antibodies 14, 15.
