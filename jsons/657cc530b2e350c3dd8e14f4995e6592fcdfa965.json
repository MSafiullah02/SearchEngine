The SARS-CoV rep gene comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome and incorporates a ribosomal slippage site [5, 6, 8] . Translation without ribosomal frameshifting generates the Orf1a protein and the (\u22121) frameshift results in translation of the extended Orf1ab polyprotein [8] . These products are then auto-cleaved by the main proteinase (3CL pro ), which is encoded within the 5 -proximal region of the rep gene [9] , to generate several nonstructural proteins including the main proteinase (3CL pro ), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the RNA helicase. The structural proteins S, E, M and N are common to all known coronaviruses [5] . They function during host cell entry and viron morphogenesis and release [10, 11] . During viron assembly, N binds to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid. M is localized at intracellular membrane structures. The interaction between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids results in budding through the membrane. The S protein is a membranous glycoprotein and is important for viral entry and might define host range, tissue tropism and virulence [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Antisense technology has become a widely used research tool for the specific inhibition of gene expression. It has attracted considerable attention as a potential therapeutic strategy [14, 15] . Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), usually 18-21 nucleotides in length, could sequence-specifically hybridize to the target mRNA through Watson-Crick base pairing to form an mRNA/DNA duplex, which is then degraded by RNAse H, a ubiquitously expressed endonuclease which hydrolyses the RNA strand of the heteroduplex. The antisense ODNs might also physically block mRNA function (e.g. translation) or gene transcription [14] . Therefore, treatment based on an antisense technique only demands knowledge of the DNA sequence of the gene and not of the function of the protein. Antisense ODNs play potential roles in the treatment of many diseases, such as cancer, influenza, AIDS and other diseases [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The problems of nuclease sensitivity and lower cellular uptake limit antisense oligonucleotides in in vivo applications [22] . More stable oligonucleotide derivatives, such as methylphosphonates [23] , phosphorothioates [24] , and phosphoramidites [25] , have been designed. Among these derivatives, phosphorothioate oligonucleotide seems to be a potential antiviral therapeutic agent. In this study, we selected antisense phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide (antisense PS-ODN, 20mer) complementary to 20-base segments within the transcripts of SARS-CoV structural proteins E, M and N.",

These structural proteins were attractive targets for the development of an anti-SARS agent. Among these proteins, we selected E, M, and N as the targets of antisense oligos. A characteristic of RNA viruses is the high rate of genetic mutation, which leads to evolution of new viral strains and is a mechanism by which viruses escape host defenses. The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, was crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism [27] . China confirmed a new case of SARS on January 5, 2004. It is the country's first new case since the outbreak last year. The results of genetic sequencing of samples from the latest patient with SARS show that variation of the S gene existed in this SARS-CoV strain [28] . Since the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations [29] . Therefore, we have not chosen the S protein as a target of antisense oligos. In this work, we have evaluated the down-regulation effects of 26 antisense PS-ODNs targeting different sites along the open reading frames (ORFs) of E, M, and N proteins and obtained 12 antisense oligos which could reduce target gene expression by over 50% in Vero E6 cells at the concentration of 50 \u00b5M in the culture medium. Therefore, we could have many choices when one target site is mutated.",

Therefore, we used high concentrations of the free antisense PS-ODNs in the cell culture medium to increase the intracellular concentrations of the PS-ODNs. In experiments with FAM-labeled antisense oligos in concentrations of 50 \u00b5M, we observed that most Vero E6 cells internalized antisense oligos in the cytoplasm and about 5% of the Vero E6 cells showed nuclear uptake of the oligo. The FAM-labeled PS-ODN also showed high stability in Vero E6 cells. In accordance with this, we obtained a long antisense downregulation effect in Vero E6 cells. As antisense PS-ODNs may not work well in in vivo treatment of diseases because of a fast breakdown and of possible toxicity, more suitable antisense oligonucleotide derivatives have been developed for therapeutic use, for example, NeuGenes antisense compounds (AVI Biopharma [34]) and locked oligonucleotides. They displayed advantageous pharmaceutical properties in stability, specificity, efficacy, delivery and safety. However, the PS-ODNs can play an important role in further studies of pathological functions of SARS genes in the Vero E6 cell model for a future treatment and cure.",

Our present results indicate a sequencespecific down-regulation effect of antisense PS-ODN (20mer) in Vero E6 cells, and we found an effective range of concentrations, where the antisense oligo inhibited expression of the E, M, and N genes of SARS-CoV in a concentration-dependent manner. The antisense PS-ODNs can be developed into effective anti-SARS agents. Besides being a potential therapeutic tool, antisense oligonucleotides provide a highly selective means to study the pathological functions of SARS-CoV genes.",

The cell cultures were washed with fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS 24 h post-transfection to remove the FAMlabeled PS-ODN. Microscopic examination of the green fluorescence was performed on days 1, 3, and 5 posttransfection (Figure 1). Fluorescence signals were mainly distributed in the cytoplasms after 24 h (Figures 1A and 1B). A nuclear accumulation of PS-ODN was observed in about 5% of the Vero E6 cells. Three and 5 days posttransfection, fluorescence signals could still be observed in the same pattern of distribution (Figures 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F). These results indicated that the antisense PS-ODN at a high concentration of 50 \u00b5M in the culture medium could be taken up by Vero E6 cells and could remain stably in the cytoplasm and the nucleus for a long time. Screening the antisense oligos that can highly inhibit the expression of the E, M and N genes of SARS-CoV To study antisense downregulation of the E, M or N gene expression, Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with constructs containing the exon of the E, M or N gene cloned in the pCDNA3.1 vector. The antisense PS-ODNs were added to the medium after 2 h at a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M. The cells were examined 24 h post-transfection for expression of the E, M or N gene by RT-PCR (Figure 2). Six antisense PS-ODNs could reduce target gene expression by over 90% at the concentration of 50 \u00b5M (",

Microscopic examination of the green fluorescence revealed that the No.2 and No.4 antisense PS-ODNs could reduce the expression of the E-EGFP fusion protein in the cells. However, the No.13 and No.20 antisense PS-ODNs, which could reduce the expression of M-EGFP and N-EGFP, respectively, had no effect on E-EGFP expression (Figures 5A and 5D).
