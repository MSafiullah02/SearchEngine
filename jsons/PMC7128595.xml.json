At that time, little was known about SARS. The aetiologic agent, mode of infection, incubation period or infectivity were not known. Decisions had to be made quickly, and in the absence of directives from the Hospital Authority, departments decided for themselves. On March 14th, we decided to suspend all term deliveries at the Prince of Wales Hospital and transfer services to the nearby Alice Ho Mui Ling Nethersole Hospital, which had a midwife based low risk delivery unit. Because there was no possibility of transferring the neonatal intensive care unit, preterm deliveries remained at the Prince of Wales Hospital.",

Despite it being a Sunday, nursing staff were called in and contacted all antenatal patients to inform them of the change. There was concern that we may have been over-reacting, but the uncertainty about whether the infection would spread to other parts of the Prince of Wales Hospital made this action prudent. We not only contacted patients, but also moved essential equipment from the delivery suite to the Alice Ho Mui Ling Nethersole Hospital, re-rostered medical, nursing and clerical staff and liaised with hospital administration at both hospitals. The press was informed and notices about the changes to the service and also what was required in terms of infection control measures were prominently displayed in all areas of the hospital. These were updated as more became known about how the virus could be transmitted.",

If large numbers of women had developed SARS, they would have been nursed in a separate ward in the Prince of Wales Hospital, and such a ward was kept vacant for this purpose. Infected women would have been cared for in a separate area of the delivery suite, and as in the medical wards, there would have been designated \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018dirty\u2019 teams of medical and nursing staff. On the general medical wards, it often took some days to determine whether individuals admitted with a fever actually had SARS, during which time, it was inevitable that SARS and non-SARS patients would mix. Fortunately, this did not occur in the obstetric and gynaecological wards.",

All other emergency gynaecology cases were transferred to other cluster hospitals. Outpatient gynaecology services were drastically reduced. Instead of routine gynaecology clinics, staff were rostered to review the case notes for each clinic and to set up a priority list for calling patients back when clinics resumed. A mechanism was set in place for renewal of prescriptions. Initially, this attracted some unfavourable press coverage, but those patients whose treatment was delayed voiced remarkably little discontent. As the magnitude of the crisis became apparent, both patients and the public avoided the Prince of Wales Hospital altogether, and the hospital became relatively deserted within a week. Limited outpatient services such as colposcopy and postmenopausal bleeding clinics resumed after eight weeks.",

This included some women who had already commenced ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilisation. It was felt inappropriate to assist couples to achieve a pregnancy when the mother was at risk of contracting SARS and needing possibly teratogenic antiviral agents. Secondly, although it had been years since an in vitro fertilisation patient needed admission to the intensive care unit for treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, we could not risk this occurrence as our patient would then have been in close proximity to SARS patients and also healthcare workers.",

In fact, some healthcare workers continued to report to work even when they had felt ill or had a slight fever, and some of these were subsequently confirmed to have SARS.

Interaction between staff and patients was minimised. Confinement became a high risk procedure, necessitating protection equivalent to or greater than that previously instituted for HIV infected patients.

It is difficult to resume normal outpatient services with too few staff to accommodate the backlog.
