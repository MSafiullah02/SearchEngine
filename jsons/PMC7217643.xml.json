An increasing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, and patients with severe disease tend to have a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal liver function. However, results have been inconsistent, with high heterogeneity among studies, and the exact magnitude of gastrointestinal and liver involvement is uncertain. Detailed pooled estimates of the prevalence of gastrointestinal and liver involvement in COVID-19 are needed. Whether this unique group of patients has a poor disease course remains unclear. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and WHO databases of publications, The Lancet COVID-19 Resource Centre, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, Gastroenterology, Gut, American Journal of Gastroenterology, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19-related publications, published between Jan 1 and April 10, 2020, using the keywords \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cnCoV\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, and \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. Eligible studies reporting the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients were included, and preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials and small case reports (<10 cases) were excluded.\nAdded value of this study\nWe have provided a pooled estimate of the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we did subgroup analyses of patients with severe versus non-severe disease, patients in Hubei province versus outside of Hubei, and paediatric versus adult patients. Features of patients with pre-existing digestive diseases and those initially presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were summarised. The disease course of patients with digestive system involvement was further analysed. We included the first subgroup analyses of patients in Hubei province versus outside of Hubei, and paediatric versus adult patients.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nDigestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19. Compared with patients with non-severe disease, patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury. Children with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms as did adults with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in Hubei had a higher prevalence of abnormal liver functions than those outside of Hubei. Approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 might present with gastrointestinal symptoms only, without respiratory symptoms. Patients with digestive system involvement as initial symptoms have delayed diagnosis of COVID-19, and those with digestive involvement have a tendency to progress to severe or critical disease and a poor disease course. Increased attention should be paid to the early identification of these patients.\n",

Compared with adult patients, paediatric patients (aged <18 years) seem to have clinically milder symptoms and show less severe alterations in radiological and laboratory testing parameters.8 Whether paediatric patients have a lower risk of gastrointestinal and liver involvement remains unclear. Moreover, several studies have provided information on the epidemiology and clinical manifestation of the disease outside of Hubei province, China. Whether gastrointestinal manifestations and liver injury in patients in Hubei differ from those outside Hubei has seldom been investigated.9, 10\n",

In one study,11 the rate of severe or critical disease was also markedly increased in patients with COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms compared with in those without gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms had significantly higher rates of complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and liver injury than did those without these symptoms.11 Pan and colleagues12 also showed that as the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.",

Odds ratios (OR) were used to describe the ratio of the probability of events occurring in patients with severe versus non-severe COVID-19. Owing to heterogeneity within and between studies, a random-effects model was used to estimate the average effect and its precision, which would give a more conservative estimate of the 95% CI. We used the I\n2 statistic and Cochran's Q test to assess statistical heterogeneity. A meta-analysis was planned to assess the association of gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury with demographic data, outcomes, and disease characteristics. The meta-analysis was done with the metaprop command of the meta package in R (version 3.2.0) for pooling single-armed rates. We used Stata (version 12.1) with the command metareg (for meta-regression) for the assessment of publication bias, and Review Manager (version 5.3) for all other analyses.",

Studies have shown that patients had varying degrees of liver function abnormalities\u2014the incidence ranged from 1% to 53%\u2014mainly indicated by abnormal ALT and AST concentrations, accompanied by slightly increased bilirubin concentrations. Albumin was decreased in severe cases (around 26\u00b73\u201330\u00b79 g/L).32 Our findings indicate that one in five patients will develop liver function abnormalities, especially in patients with severe disease, thus close attention should be paid to liver dysfunction when treating patients with COVID-19 over the hospitalisation period. Liver injury was characterised by slight increases in hepatocyte-related enzymes, including ALT and AST. Cholangiocyte-related enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, were also reported to be slightly increased in a few patients.65 Studies on the exact mechanism of COVID-19-related liver injury are scarce. Liver abnormalities of patients with COVID-19 may be due to viral infection in liver cells or other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation.66 A post-mortem biopsy study in a patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, indicating that the injury could have been caused by either COVID-19 or drug-induced liver injury.67, 68 Similar to the situation in patients with SARS, drugs such as antivirals might cause liver injury in patients with COVID-19.69 However, one study reported that no significant difference in the prevalence of liver injury existed between patients on medication versus those who were not, when stratified by pre-hospital medications, including antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol.68 Further studies are warranted in this setting.",

In a multicentre study, Pan and colleagues12 investigated the prevalence and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with digestive symptoms. In 99 patients who presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint, a longer time from onset to admission was observed compared with patients without digestive symptoms (9\u00b70 days vs 7\u00b73 days). As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more numerous. Patients without digestive symptoms were more likely to be cured and discharged than were patients with digestive symptoms (60% vs 34%).12 This finding was consistent with the study from Wang and colleagues,33 who found that patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have abdominal pain and loss of appetite compared with non-ICU patients.33 We did subgroup analyses to investigate the difference in gastrointestinal symptoms between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. We found a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, including loss of appetite, and abdominal pain in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe disease. Cai and colleagues37 showed that liver injury occurred more frequently in patients with severe disease than in patients with non-severe disease. We also found a significantly higher risk of liver function abnormalities in those with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease. In patients with COVID-19 who died, the incidence of liver injury might reach as high as 58%70 or 78%.71 One study reported that serum ALT increased up to 7590 U/L and AST up to 1445 U/L in a patient with severe COVID-19.32\n",

We found that patients presenting with initial gastrointestinal symptoms only had longer duration from illness onset to hospital admission. The rate of severe or critical illness was markedly increased in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms than in those without. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms also had an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. No significant difference was seen when considering pooled rates of discharge, length of hospital stay, and rates of death between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. This finding might be due to the somewhat low incidence of each event. Moreover, the risk of severe disease was not increased among patients with COVID-19 with existing gastrointestinal or liver-related comorbidities compared with patients without such comorbidities. Thus, newly presenting gastrointestinal symptoms rather the existing digestive comorbidities were predictive of severe disease course. Altogether, our findings support the importance of early inclusion of symptoms such as diarrhoea in the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

An early study including 80 cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu province showed that patients with COVID-19 exhibited milder or more moderate symptoms and a lower proportion of liver dysfunction compared with patients in Wuhan.38 Our subgroup analysis suggested that no difference existed in the rate of overall gastrointestinal symptoms between patients within Hubei and those outside. Patients in Hubei had a higher risk of presenting with abnormal liver function than did those outside of Hubei. One explanation is that Hubei might have had more patients with severe disease compared with outside of Hubei, which might result in the higher percentage of patients with abnormal liver function in Hubei. However, the studies included in our analysis did not show significant differences in the proportion of patients with severe disease between Hubei and outside of Hubei (data not shown). Thus this geographic difference needs to be further investigated in future studies.",

In an investigation8 of ten paediatric patients, eight (80%) persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal tests became negative.8 Our pooled estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA positivity in faecal samples was 54% (95% CI 44\u201364). Viral positivity can persist for as long as 47 days after symptom onset (appendix p 6).61 Data from Wu and colleagues60 suggest the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces, for nearly 5 weeks after the patients' respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the clinical implications of prolonged viral excretion in faeces, including the association with disease course, severity, and even recurrence of COVID-19, remains unclear. More studies are needed to show the virus' replication competence, abundance in stool, and stability in the environment.72, 73\n",

First, an assessment of the methodological quality showed deficiencies in the studies assessed\u2014all 35 studies included were considered to be of low quality. Second, because of insufficient data reported in the original publications, we could not assess the effects of other factors, such as sex, age, and comorbidities, on the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms at diagnosis and risk of liver injury. Third, the criteria for severe COVID-19 differed among studies, which might have contributed to the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis. Last, significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed in our study for estimating the prevalence of digestive system symptoms. After reviewing each study, the non-specific symptom of appetite loss and two studies40, 49 that were focused on patients with gastrointestinal symptoms contributed to most of the heterogeneity. When these studies were excluded from the analysis, the pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was with modest heterogeneity. The pooled rates of the other three symptoms (nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain) were similar to our original results, with only mild or modest heterogeneity.",

Patients in Hubei had a similar risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms but higher risk of liver injury than did those outside of Hubei. Children with COVID-19 had a similar risk of gastrointestinal symptoms to that of adult patients. A tenth of patients with COVID-19 might present only with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms; such patients could have delayed diagnosis. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms have a tendency to develop severe or critical disease and have a poor disease course.
