However, in view of the high incidence of polyarthritis and heart lesions, vaccination within the first few weeks of life is not recommended. The incidence of immunity was less in calves vaccinated when aged from 5-9 months old, among which detectable reactions to inoculation (tail swellings and CF titre) had also been fewer.",

This supremacy has been enhanced by the new formulations now available as the direct result of considerable scientific investigation that showed the important part played by particle size and purity of the phenothiazine. Gordon (1956) demonstrated the necessity for a fine particle size and Forsyth (1961) showed that a product of high purity is r q h d for maximum etlkhcy. Forsyth concluded that a RakrimmR purity of 85% is I~C~BEsary to obtain amsistestly Boofi anthelmintic results, ptulictdady in t&e control of Ostertagia and Tricho*mgylus speaks. In spite of the anthelmintic s u p i u d t y sbown by phenothiazine there is ample mom for improvement as regards its action on maay of the nematode parasites of sheep. Resistance by the worms has been demonstrated in the U S A . (Drudge cz d. (1957) (a, b) ) and is suspected to exist in Australia. A further cause for concern is the occasional reports of losses following its use received by the N.S.W. Department of Agriculture.",
