            "text": "Wild birds represent a sentinel reservoir for a wide range of viral and bacterial pathogens, with the potential to infect domestic birds and disseminate over long distances in a short time [1]. Therefore, wild birds play a crucial role in the introduction, maintenance, and dissemination of pathogens globally, including zoonotics [2,3,4]. Several studies have indicated the transmission of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria from sewage, manure, contaminated water, and feeds from domestic birds as well as other animal and human sources to wild birds. These populations can then become reservoirs, recombination melting pots, and potential long-distance spreaders of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes [5,6,7,8]. Furthermore, wild birds, especially waterfowl, represent the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses (IAV), which mostly present in the low pathogenic (LPAI) forms, including the H5 and H7 subtypes that were transmitted and maintained in domestic birds, to convert to high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) [9,10]. However, wild birds could also be a direct source of HPAI as in the case of the introduction of H5N1 and H5N8 to Egypt [11]. The other way around has been reported in outbreaks of HPAI-H5N1 in Asia, where HPAI subtypes have spilled over into wild bird populations from domestic birds in live bird markets (LBM) [12]. ",

Notably, both HPAI-H5N1 and H5N8 were first detected in wild birds from a wetland in the Damietta Governorate in northern Egypt shortly before spreading to domestic birds [13,14,15]. In contrast, LPAI-H9N2 was first detected in domestic birds in Giza [16]. However, recent evidence of H9N2 reassortment with Eurasian AIVs circulating in wild birds was detected in pigeons, presumably due to co-infection with viruses from poultry and migratory waterfowl [17]. Wild migratory birds land in wetland areas in Egypt that are close to human activities including backyard and commercial farming, especially on the northern coast. These areas are where most of the cases have been confirmed [11].",

BLAST analysis showed a close relationship (> 98% nucleotide homology) to a recent wild bird virus from China (A/wild bird/Wuhan/CDHN09/2015 (H6N2) and water wildfowl virus from Korea (A/water wildfowl/Korea/M129/2014(H6N1) and Egyptian H6N2 (A/Eurasian-teal/Egypt/P2-29/2017). This is suggestive of a Eurasian wild bird origin. Genome analysis revealed that the H6N2 viruses are low pathogenic to chickens with a monobasic cleavage site (PQIETR/GLF).The presence of Q226 and G228 (H3 numbering) on HA indicated a preference of avian (\u03b12,3-linked sialic acid receptors). Using NetNGlyc 1.0 server six potential, N-linked glycosylation sites in HA were identified. ",

Only 10 Northern shoveler birds were positive for type A influenza virus as evidenced by real-time PCR. The Northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata) is considered an important AIV reservoir and is known to have high rates of AIV prevalence [25,26]. To our knowledge, 12 different AIV subtypes have been recovered from Northern shoveler in Egypt and these include H1N1, H2N8, H5N2, H6N2, H7N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H10N1, H10N4, H10N7, and H10N9 [20,26,27,28,29]. All of them present in low pathogenic forms. Alternatively, in the present study, HPAI-H5N8, LPAI-H9N2, and LPAI-H6N2 subtypes have been recovered from 4, 4, and 1birds, respectively. Hemagglutinin gene sequencing and phylogentic analysis showed higher similarity and clustering with currently circulating H5N8, H9N2, and H6N2 genotypes in domestic fowl. The same findings were previously reported in Egypt [26], where H5N1 and H9N2 viruses were detected in migratory mallards and were genetically closely related to AIV circulating in domestic poultry. In the same context, HPAI has been occasionally reported in wild birds near to affected poultry flocks, but these bird have played a minor or no role in the dissemination of the virus [30]. We believe that Northern shoveler acquire enzootic influenza infection via direct contact with domestic birds in LBM with the absence of clinical signs, which was previously reported [26]. Furthermore, we reported that all positive birds sampled on the same day from the same market had influenza with very high similarity to enzootic viruses, and this scenario suggests a single source of infection. In contrast, the pandemic H5N1 and H5N8 introduced to Egypt in late 2005 and 2016, respectively, were first detected in a Eurasian green-winged teal (Anas crecca) which was found dead in the same area [13,31]. In this case, viruses spread to domestic birds where they evolved and became markedly diverged from the original virus introduced via wild birds. Altogether, it is unlikely that captured infected wild birds can play a role in the dissemination of the virus to other destinations. However, it is worth mentioning that it is still a considerable risk factor of exporting enzootic H5N8 and H9N2 via migration. Further, wild birds in LBM could act as mixing vessels for different influenza subtypes that may lead to reassortment. Different surveillances strategies should be developed to find out whether the enzootic viruses are able to disseminate to wild birds from LBM or in their free habitat as well. Environmental sampling should include fresh fecal sampling and onsite birds sampling is required for insight analysis of the ability of domestic birds to disseminate enzootic viruses to wild birds in their habitat.

Potentially, a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. has been recovered in this study with a prevalence of 20.2% (n=30/148), when comparing to previous studies [35,36,37]. Furthermore, a high prevalence of both E.coli and Salmonella were detected in waterfowl, especially in the Northern Shoveler, where 38.2% and 32.4% of tested samples were positive for E.coli and Salmonella, respectively, with highly diversified E. coli and salmonella serovars, demonstrating the possible particular importance of the Northern shoveler in the dissemination of bacterial pathogens of human and veterinary importance as well as AIV in Egypt.",

Both cities are located atthe north-eastern corner of the Nile delta. Damietta is located between the Damietta branch of the river Nile and Lake Manzala on the northern coast of Egypt. Gamasais located on the northeast coast toward the west of Damietta branch. This area hosts significant numbers of overwintering waterfowl each year andis frequented by poultry from surrounding households and commercial poultry farming. Furthermore, this area had positive influenza cases in domestic birds just before the sampling period, as confirmed by the Reference Laboratory for Veterinary Quality Control on Poultry Production (RLQP). The sample size was limited to the agreement of fishermen or bird sellers. However, to guide field researchers and ensure effective sampling, only live migratory birds that were caged or tied close to a live bird and offered for sale in LBM were sampled. Representative images of sampled birds and their clinical signs were reported. Two cloacal swabs were collected from each bird, the first of which was placed individually in cryovials containing viral transport medium for IAV detection. The second swab was kept in non-selective media for bacterial isolation and identification. Samples were stored on ice once collected and were transported rapidly to RLQP for laboratory processing. The sampling plan and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by RLQP Scientific and Ethics committee (Agreement No. 2429), in accordance with guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation and the Ministry of the Environment, Egypt.",

However, it is still not fully confirmed whether wild birds acquired enzootic AIV and CIA resistance from other domestic birds in the LBM or through the intake of polluted water or food contaminated with human or animal waste in their habitat or from backyard birds near to their habitat. On that basis, further epidemiological studies include environmental samples from wild birds\u2019 habitat, onsite wild birds sampling, plus samples from surrounding domestic birds in backyards, LBM, and from sellers using appropriate sanitation measures. This is necessary to understand the mode of transmission of resistant bacteria and enzootic AIV to wild birds and their ability to maintain and disseminate infection into the environment. Further, the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and presence of diversified E. coli serotypes, Salmonella pathotypes, and AIV in some species, such as Northern shoveler, which is considered a very common migratory bird that lands in Egypt for about four months per year, highlights the importance of providing a list of the number and species of the sampled birds in all future studies [11] and strengthens the importance of the directed surveillance in particular important wild birds.
