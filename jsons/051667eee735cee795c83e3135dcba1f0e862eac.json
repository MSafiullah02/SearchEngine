As an outgrowth of this call, researchers in the field have made evolutionary theory and hypothesis testing a priority over descriptive and typological studies. Biological anthropologists have also attempted to integrate study goals with researchers in related fields, such as human genetics, psychology, and organismal biology. Despite these efforts, theoretical developments in these other fields continue to advance at a fast pace, but biological anthropology fails to incorporate those developments into its overall research program. Moreover, our integration with these disciplines, as well as our sibling subdisciplines within anthropology, has been inconstant and inconsistent among biological anthropologists. Without correcting these trends, bioanthropological research might ultimately be courting obsolescence.",

            "text": "This symposium seeks to address these issues with three goals for guiding the future of biological anthropology: 1) ensuring biological anthropology research is based on current knowledge and theoretical developments in associated fields (especially evolutionary biology); 2) reducing the balkanization among anthropological disciplines-even within biological anthropology-and improving interdisciplinary communication with other fields of research; and 3) making ethics and the incorporation of cultural knowledge a centerpiece to the practical application of biological anthropology studies. Using their research as examples, participants will discuss solutions and practical steps toward achieving these goals. Research on the mechanical properties of primate foods was initiated by the late Dr. Warren Kinzey in the 1970's, but received further impetus in the 1990's from the introduction of portable mechanical devices such as the Darvell HKU tester. Data from these studies have been directed to research questions on topics asdiverse as dietary selection, cranio-dental morphology, and social behavior. The results have indicated the mechanical diversity of foods that primates consume and demonstrated how important quantification is for answering these questions. In this symposium, we bring together researchers who have both developed and used some of these methods to try to understand the relationship between the diet, morphology and socioecology of primates. We conclude the symposium with a meta-analysis of the current dataset in relation to primate cranio-dental variation. Such a synthesis is essential for better understanding of the functional significance of variation in cranio-dental morphology within the hominid lineage. 14 Hominin hard object feeding as inferred from dental chipping analysis.

Richard Jantz has been a teacher, mentor, and colleague at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for over 40 years, and has recently retired. His numerous contributions to understanding human variation (anthropometric, dermatoglyphic, and osteometric) have greatly impacted many facets of biological anthropology. He also oversaw the establishment and preservation of databases including skeletal observations from modern Americans (the Forensic Data Bank), anthropometrics from Native Americans (from Franz Boas), and worldwide dermatoglyphic observations (from Heinz Brehme), which have and will continue to benefit many anthropologists. Most recently he was a litigant in the Kennewick Man case, highlighting his contributions to understanding the earliest Americans.

            "text": "A foundational and widely supported concept in evolutionary biology is that female reproductive success is limited by access to resources while male reproductive success is limited primarily by access to mates. Thus, research programs have emphasized the substantial costs of female reproductive effort but have tended to focus on variation in the benefits obtained by males. However, the processes necessary to achieve reproductive success may carry a high price for males, and the ability to sustain these costs may determine the success of some males and the failure of others. The nature and extent of these costs is expected to vary by mating system and ecological context and can have far-reaching consequences for social behavior and demographic composition of populations. This symposium highlights studies on costs of male reproductive effort in a variety of primate species, including humans. Our contributors will present new research on male behavior, physiology, life history, demography and health in the context of male mating effort and competition. A key emphasis for discussion will be the theorized trade-off between reproductive effort and survival, and whether some males can maintain high reproductive effort despite the costs throughout their lifespan. periods and demonstrate considerable variation from Lower Nubian mortuary contexts. Innovative and theoretically informed bioarchaeological research is advancing our understanding of colonialism, social practices including dental ablation and sacrifice, and the health consequences of conflict and illnesses arising from infectious diseases (e.g., brucellosis) and metabolic conditions (e.g., scurvy). This symposium aims to bring together for the first time researchers working on Upper Nubian and central Sudanese samples to share findings on aspects of health, identity, and mortuary practices. Discussion of these issues and the similarities and differences encountered in various locations and between Upper and Lower Nubian groups will stimulate further research and collaborations within these regions. This symposium brings together experts in both the field of morphometrics and that of physical anthropology to carry on the work begun over a decade ago, at the 2002 AAPA special session, Modern Morphometrics in Physical Anthropology. We argue that there continues to be a great and immediate need to develop new techniques and to make steady improvements upon our preexisting methods in order to resolve the complex biological questions that are emerging within the present data-driven, genomic, and computationally intensive age. The mathematically tractable, highly adaptable, and efficient methods of geometric morphometrics are playing a critical role in ongoing efforts to increase our explanatory power. The goal of this symposium is to reflect upon the current state of the art: to present the latest theoretical advancements and methodological improvements, to highlight the key innovations in scholarship, and to demonstrate how the synergy between these two fields can continue to open up new avenues of research of interest to theoreticians and practitioners alike. The topics of discussion will cover such diverse areas as primatology, paleoanthropology, biological and forensic anthropology, while also adopting a variety of methodological perspectives and addressing the utility of these approaches to many different research ends.",

Sokal, who contributed much to biostatistics, systematics, anthropology, morphometrics, and many other fields. It is to his memory that this symposium is dedicated. Following postdoctoral work, his career has been spent in a department of orthodontics. However, his research in dental morphology, metrics, development, and variation has always been anthropological. This research, along with Edward's support, insights, editorship, and camaraderie, has influenced at least two generations of anthropologists.

One potential adverse impact of stress at both the individual and the population level is decreased health.

            "text": "The posters in this symposium include a survey of current ethnoprimatological studies and highlight new theoretical approaches to ethnoprimatology. Topics include: the use of geographic information systems and GPS in ethnoprimatology; overlapping resource use between humans and non-human primates; the effect of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and/or tourism on non-human primate behavior, stress and parasite load; disease transmission between humans and non-human primates; conflict dynamics between humans and non-human primates (e.g., crop-damage, hunting) and the place of nonhuman primates in local cultures. The goal of this symposium is to facilitate collaboration between researchers utilizing approaches from different disciplines to examine human and non-human primate interactions. As humans and human-modified habitats will play an increasingly larger role in studies of non-human primates in the near future, the results of ethnoprimatological research are especially important and relevant. During the 2012 AAPA Open Forum, \"The Ethics of Practice and the Practice of Ethics: an open dialogue among bioanthropologists\", it became clear that many researchers felt that the available ethical training and resources do not adequately address the unique needs of researchers in biological anthropology. Participants identified several areas of focus as deserving attention within our community, including the ethics inherent in field work, common challenges in working with skeletal remains, and the need for intradisciplinary conversation concerning professional relationships within our field. This symposium aims to address these identified needs, as well as other ethical challenges in our field. The symposium offers perspectives both on the application of ethics to procedural topics such as repatriation, field site management, and gaining family consent, and to emerging ethical topics that necessitate discussion, such as the Open Access movement. It is our sincere hope that by extending the current discourse on ethics, we can work to address the unique ethical challenges and questions that biological anthropologists engage during their research. Anthropologists have long documented illnesses, disease, and stress among the remains of past peoples. Bioarchaeologists, those studying ancient human biocultural interactions, have long diagnosed and described illnesses, identified the physically handicapped and sought to understand the evolution and ecology of ancient diseases. Increasingly, anthropology has pointed out the ways that health afflictions, injuries, and disabilities also have social lives. Through contextualized, careful archaeological research, bioarchaeologists have advocated placing health and disease data in cultural, regional, and temporal contexts to comprehend the social experience of disease and disability. Papers in this session build on this work to understand the symbolic, social and political dimensions of illness in the past using the concept of disease ideologies. Disease ideologies refer to communities' understandings of illness or disability phenotypes. These etiologies include cultural comprehension of disease causation, moralization of the ill or an illness, and the ways social metaphors make sense of sickness. By using the concept of disease ideologies, we explicitly draw on theories commonly used in medical anthropology. In doing so, papers in this session seek to initiate greater dialogue between medical and cultural anthropologists, bioarchaeologists, and paleopathologists in order to bring their expertise to bear in unraveling the social and biological complexities of illness, disease, and disability in the past.

He has also played a central role in the establishment and development of bioarchaeology, now a highly influential and interdisciplinary field within anthropology. His scholarly accomplishments are surpassed only by his commitment to mentorship and collaboration. In that spirit, this symposium brings together research from his several generations of grad students as well as others who trained under him. The posters reflect the interdisciplinary and biocultural frameworks that he pioneered, and the cross-and inter-generational collaborations that he fostered",

Session 37: Concepts and Realities -Humans in Time and Space: Papers in Honor of Fred Hines Smith. Invited Poster Symposium. Organizers: James Ahern and Ivor Jankovic. 200DE.Fred Hines Smith, former AAPA president, has had a lasting influence on various fields of research on human origins and evolution. His conceptual ideas and models, his meticulous studies of fossils, his involvement in the development of the field of paleoanthropology in Croatia, his influence on generations of students, many of which are now scholars of human origins themselves, are just some among many contributions that he had over the years. This year's AAPA meetings are held in Fred's home state and in the place where he first held an academic position. Furthermore, the sequel to one of Fred's most influential works (edited with Frank Spencer), Origins of Modern Humans: A World Survey of the Fossil Evidence is in publication. Thus, it is now appropriate to honor Fred's many contributions. This symposium brings together an array of papers that all share a common theme that has been central to Fred's work: conceptual understanding built upon detailed analyses of human biology in time and space. Reflecting Fred's own body of work, many of the contributions are on later human evolution, while some focus on variation and evolution of more recent populations.12:30-1:30 pm Poster set-up. 5:00-5:30 pm Poster take-down. 4:30-5:00 pm Discussion.

Organizers: Brenda Baker and Tina Jakob. 200DE. the twentieth century, a biocultural approach to the study of human remains from ancient Nubia was developed as large numbers of cemeteries were excavated during archaeological rescue projects south of Aswan, Egypt. Our understanding of ancient Nubia is based mainly on sites between the First and Dal Cataracts (southern Egypt to northernmost Sudan) because few skeletal samples from Upper Nubia and central Sudan (Third Cataract to the south of the Sixth Cataract of the Nile River) existed prior to the 2000s. Recent bioarchaeological fieldwork and research on human remains from sites south of the Dal Cataract have added significantly to our understanding of ancient Nubian societies from the Paleolithic to Christian (medieval)",
