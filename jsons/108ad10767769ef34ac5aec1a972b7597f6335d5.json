We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

The survey was promoted via email to MQ's supporter network and via social media. In total, 2198 people completed the survey, submitting 4350 concerns about the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and 1987 responses about what has helped to maintain mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. A thematic analysis of the full dataset was done. Third, two questions were asked on Ipsos MORI's online Omnibus survey to collect data on people's concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on mental wellbeing and what is helping people's mental wellbeing at this time. In total, 1099 interviews were completed with adults aged between 16 and 75 years from across England, Wales, and Scotland. Quotas were set and data were weighted to the offline population to ensure a nationally representative sample by gender, age, and region. Statistical analysis was done and any subgroup differences included are statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval unless stated otherwise. A summary report of the findings of both surveys and further methodological details can be found online. 4 The Ipsos MORI tabular data can be found on its website. 5 Finally, the manuscript was peer-reviewed by a reviewer with lived experience of a mental health issue. We acknowledge the limitations of our surveys, including the representativeness of the MQ sample, the short timescale for input, and the representativeness of online populations.

Although worries and uncertainties about a pandemic are common, for some they can cause undue distress and impairment to social and occupational functioning. 14,59,60 Across society, a sense of loss can stem from losing direct social contacts, and also range from loss of loved ones, to loss of employment, educational opportunities, recreation, freedoms, and supports. Existing evidence suggests some measures taken to control the pandemic might have a disproportionate effect on those most vulnerable (panel 2). Vulnerable groups include those with pre-existing mental or physical health issues (including those with severe mental illnesses), recovered individuals, and those who become mentally unwell (eg, in response to anxiety and loneliness surrounding the pandemic; panel 2). 14,61,62 Therefore, loss of access to mental health support, alongside loss of positive activities, might increase vulnerability during COVID-19 lockdown. Increased feelings of anxiety and depression in response to the outbreak have been highlighted already. 63 Health workers who come in close contact with the virus and are exposed to traumatic events, such as death and dying, while making highly challenging decisions, are particularly at risk of stress responses. 15 The pandemic intersects with rising mental health issues in childhood and adolescence. 2, 64, 65 Ascertaining and mitigating the effects of school closures for youth seeking care is urgent and essential, given that school is often the first place children and adolescents seek help, 64,66 as is considering vulnerabilities, such as special educational needs and developmental disorders, and finding therapeutic levers. 67 For the older population, promoting good mental health is important during self-isolation, which can be compounded by lifestyle restrictions, exacerbated loneliness, comorbidities (such as dementia), and feelings of worry and guilt for using resources. 68 There is an acute need to identify, in consultation with people with lived experience, remotely delivered interventions that support those at risk of abuse. 69, 70 The immediate research priorities are to reduce mental health issues and support wellbeing in vulnerable groups in particular. A coordinating mechanism for pandemic mental health interventions is required for the agile identification of interventions that can be repurposed, alongside the identification of intervention gaps that will require bespoke de novo design, and the evaluation and roll-out of remotely delivered interventions.
