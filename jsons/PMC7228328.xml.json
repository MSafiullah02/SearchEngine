That letter was also included in this review. The initial search was complemented by a further Medline search on March 19, 2020 by the author. This focused on 2019\u2010nCoV, but this did not yield any additional studies (Appendix S1). This means that the current review was based on 45 scientific papers and letters. Most of the studies originated from China and it was notable that there were very few reports on children from Italy, Iran or South Korea, despite the large number of patients with diagnosed COVID\u201019 in those countries.
