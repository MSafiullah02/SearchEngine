One of the finding is that the aggressive imposing the most significant measures followed by equally aggressive reducing them when the spread diminishes will effectively reduce the number of new infections to zero. We use the asymptotic periodicity of Bessel functions, which readily provides the required; but the epidemic may resume. Practically: the hesitation before enabling some protection measures must be at least doubled before disabling them. Also, the square root of the intensity of hard measures is inversely proportional to the epidemic duration, which works surprisingly well practically; a couple of examples is given.",

In this note, we propose a system of differential equations describing the effects of momentum management of epidemics , which can be defined as a system of measures of any nature aimed at reducing the epidemic spread by regulating the rate of change of these measures on the basis of the latest absolute or average numbers of infections. The usage of the absolute numbers here is combined with \"hard measures\" like detection and prompt isolation of infected people and closing the places where the spread is the most likely. We demonstrate mathematically that the epidemic will end under such management, but this may lead to its recurrence. To prevent the return of the epidemic, the reduction of hard measures must be at significantly slower pace comparing with that when these measures were imposed initially. Our model shows a strong trend toward the \u2020 April 16, 2020.",

For instance, we prove within our model that the square root of the intensity of hard measures is inversely proportional to the duration of the epidemic; a couple of examples of the practical usage of our formula for the duration of the epidemic is provided: Switzerland and the USA.

The simplest equation for the spread of communicable diseases results in exponential growth of the number of infections, which is mostly applicable to the initial stages of epidemics.

The equally classical logistic equations for the spread, as well as the SIR and SID models, assume the saturation of the number of infections. Such saturation and related herd immunity are not what we address. The saturation of this kind was not really the case with the epidemics we faced during the last 100 years, even when the numbers of infections were big. This is obviously due to better disease control worldwide. Though the viruses attacked humans during this period were possibly not of extraordinary-aggressive type ... from historic perspective.",

The \"megaproblem\" of understanding and managing epidemics is very ramified and interdisciplinary; significant assumptions are inevitable in any models. Making our justifications more \"rigorous\" is a challenge, but we think that the experimental confirmation is the key. We are of course fully aware of the statistical nature of the problem. The usage of random processes, like Bessel processes, is reasonable here to address the randomness around epidemics. Also, connections with usual SIR and SID models are of importance, though they are of different nature.",

Then the square root of their intensity will be inversely proportional to the duration of the epidemic.
