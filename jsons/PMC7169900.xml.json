Kirkby and Mackenzie discussed the potential of lungs low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia treatment and suggested the re-examination of this forgotten therapeutic approach [2]. There are tempting reports from the early twentieth century which observed high efficacy of this method to treat pneumonia by X-Ray [3], [4]. This may open a new horizon in COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. However, some points should be taken into account to enhance the further clinical trials\u2019 outcome.",

Thus, the cost and benefit ratio for inhibition of inflammation at COVID-19 patients should be evaluated. Critically ill patients would be the first target for any possible clinical trials. Inflammatory cytokine storm affects a substantial number of these patients [7]. The LDRT is currently used for the decrease of limited inflammations in particular diseases like osteoarthritis and not a cytokine storm [8]. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of LDRT may not be very effective in controlling this storm in COVID-19. On the other hand, the most important concern about utilizing anti-inflammatory medications for controlling systemic inflammation is the suppression of immune response against infectious agents [9]. So, LDRT anti-inflammatory effects may disrupt immune system fighting against COVID-19 virus and delay virus elimination. Also, the window time of anti-inflammatory treatment is very important. According to reports, fatal COVID-19 cases are usually fast progressive and deteriorate under two weeks after onset. Therefore, prompt initiation of the anti-inflammatory therapy at this extremely short golden window time is determinative in the treatment outcome [10].",

It should be mentioned that LDRT anti-inflammatory effects aren\u2019t limited to the irradiated site and LDRT exhibits systemic effects [5], [6].
