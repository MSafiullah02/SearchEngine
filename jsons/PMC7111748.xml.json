            "text": "Over the last few decades an increasing number of pathogenic microorganisms have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics. This poses problems in the clinical management of infections, especially in immuno-compromised individuals but also increasingly, at the community level. During the same period, more worryingly, the development of new antibiotics has decreased. Selective pressures caused by the overuse of conventional antibiotics in the healthcare setting, as well as unprecedented increases both in global transport systems and migration has led to a situation of previously isolated forms of resistance being widespread. The ability of mobile genetic elements of bacterial plasmids to spread through a population is increasing the rate of resistance (Kumarasamy et al., 2010). While the media portrayal of an imminent crisis of untreatable infections is misguided, the position in reality is rather more complex. Although treatment options for some pathogens have undoubtedly decreased, for others the position has actually reversed (Livermore et al., 2009). A major problem in modern antibiotic drug development is designing agents that are not easily susceptible to resistance and therefore a new approach to drug development is required (Jenssen et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent an ancient defence mechanism that transverses the evolutionary spectrum and remains an effective strategy against invading pathogens. Because of their selectivity for prokaryotic membranes and their membrane-disruptive mechanisms for which microbes have little natural resistance, the spotlight in recent years has turned towards the development of novel antibiotics from these peptides (Zasloff, 2002). Previous attempts to develop AMPs into the clinical setting have proven frustrating, with a number of peptides being rejected during the latter stages of clinical trials (Gordon et al., 2005). However a recent commentary (Fox, 2013) examined these failures and provided optimism for future AMP development; in this light, a number of these previous attempts are discussed below. For example, pexiganan (Lamb and Wiseman, 1998), a 22 residue peptide developed for the treatment of foot ulcers was stopped because of manufacturing difficulties and changes in the clinical trial design, leading to a non-approval letter been issued (1999) due to deficiencies with US Chemistry Manufacturing & Controls. The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) also indicated that pexiganan was no more effective in treating foot ulcers than conventional antibiotics. Similarly plectasin (NZ2114) (Mygind et al., 2005) developed by Novozymes for the treatment of Gram positive infections and licenced (2008) to Sanofi-Aventis was abandoned because of commercial rather than scientific reasons. In another example, omiganan (Sader et al., 2004), which had good efficacy in inhibiting catheter associated infections, was rejected on the grounds of cost when it was demonstrated to show no clinical statistical difference when compared to the widely used povidone iodine.",

However recent acceptance of the lipopeptide, Daptomycin (2003) and the vancomycin derived Telavancin (2007), which have relatively low therapeutic indices compared with conventional \u03b2-lactams, would suggest a possible change in regulation. In this changing climate, pexiganan is re-entering clinical trials, as Locilex (Fox, 2013).",

Scorpion venom AMPs are positively charged amphipathic peptides and can be conveniently divided into three structural categories: (1) cysteine containing peptides with disulfide bridges; (2) peptides with an amphipathic \u03b1-helix but lacking cysteine residues and (3) peptides rich in certain amino acids such as proline and glycine. This review aims to provide an examination of AMPs from scorpion venom (Table 1\n; Fig. 1\n), with discussions on structure, biological activity and proposed mechanisms of action, together with a final discussion of recent and future strategies for mining new bioactive molecules.",

Haemolytic activity was observed at 30 \u03bcM.

            "text": "Studies on two antimicrobial peptides isolated from Pandinus imperator (Corzo et al., 2001) have shed further light on the contribution of the two \u03b1-helical regions discussed above, to biological function. Pandinin 1 (Pin1) has two \u03b1-helical regions between residues 3\u201318 and 20\u201339, separated by a random coil region containing a Pro-19 kink. In contrast, NMR analysis of pandinin 2 (Pin2) in a 60% TFE solvent containing DPC micelles, showed that this second peptide had a singular helical structure between residues 2\u201318 with no significant kink at the equivalent proline residue (Pro-14) (Nomura et al., 2005). The structural differences found between these two peptides are significant. While the antimicrobial activity of Pin 1and Pin 2 against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was broadly similar, it is the haemolytic studies on eukaryotic membranes that are of most interest. Pin2 lysed 51% of sheep erythrocytes at 22 \u03bcM whilst Pin1 only lysed 1.4% at the same concentration (Corzo et al., 2001). The authors suggest that the ability of Pin 2 to lyse both eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes may be related more to the venom toxicity, in a similar manner to the bee venom peptide melittin, than a specific antimicrobial action. In contrast, the activity of Pin1 is more in keeping with magainin1, the prototype AMP isolated from the skin of the South American toad, Xenopus. A flexible hinge region is also important in successful AMP design. Replacing (structurally rigid) Pro-14 in Pin2 with a (flexible) GVG tripeptide reduces the haemolytic activity of Pin2 without altering its antimicrobial activity (Rodriguez et al., 2011). This substitution creates a more flexible region while retaining the essential amphipathic nature of Pin 2 which is more in tune with the dual helical structure of Corzo, Nakajima and colleagues have subsequently demonstrated that the haemolytic activity of Pin1, Pin2 and other cationic amphipathic peptides (e.g. IsCt1, see Section 3.3) depends on the animal species studied (guinea pig > pig > sheep) and this is turn is related to the phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin ratio in the different erythrocyte membranes (Belokoneva et al., 2003).",

            "text": "With such contrasting effects on prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes, a comparison of the mechanisms of action of these two peptides is of particular interest and it is instructive to consider these mechanisms in greater detail. On examination of the effects of Pin2 on phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid vesicles using a calcian dye release assay, it was seen that the dose response curve for dye efflux was sigmoidal, suggesting peptide oligomerisation during the time course of the experiment. The effects of Pin2 were seen at very low peptide: phospholipid concentrations (Belokoneva et al., 2004). When phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), known to promote negative membrane curvature (Matsuzaki et al., 1998), was incorporated into the PC vesicles, no change in Pin2 activity was observed, supporting the hypothesis of a barrel-stave mechanism of pore formation (see Fig. 2\nfor a background explanation to current hypotheses for the mechanism of action of AMPs). Dextran-loaded liposome assays also showed great variability in the size (1.8\u20135 nm) of the membrane pores generated by Pin2, dependent on peptide: phospholipid ratios (Belokoneva et al., 2004). Based on NMR studies of Pin2, Nomura and colleagues (Nomura et al., 2005) proposed a pore forming mechanism of action, as a consequence of Pin2 inducing clustering of hydrophobic residues which allows further incursion into the membrane hydrophobic core and interaction with the inner membrane. This process can be conveniently visualized in a step-wise fashion as shown in Fig. 3\n. Pin2 inserts into the membrane at a 45\u00b0 angle however is seen to be only at a 25\u00b0 angle around the Leu 12 residue. This causes a slight kink in the peptide when in the membrane, and is a phenomena seen in other pore forming AMPs, thus thought to be essential for activity. After insertion, oligomerisation occurs between the Pin2 monomers and then pore oligomerisation is seen leading to membrane being trapped between these pores to be \u2018pinched off\u2019. Thus Pin2 induces a 2 fold attack on the target with loss of intracellular constituents through the pore lumen and loss of membrane through pore association.",

This can also be conveniently visualised (Fig. 4\n). The Pin1 N-terminal helices are tilted at a 30\u00b0 angle with respect to the horizontal bilayer plane and the C-terminal helices.

In CD studies, vejovine adopted an \u03b1-helical secondary structure in 60% TFE although it remained unordered in aqueous solution. In contrast, Vm36 peptide adopted an \u03b1-helical structure in aqueous solution which may indicate that the increased flexibility of vejovine is a key factor in promoting antimicrobial activity.

Although meucin-24 can be considered amphipathic, the hydrophobic face of the molecule contains only six residues; this reduction in hydrophobicity has been postulated to be responsible for the lack of antibacterial activity (Gao et al., 2010). The charged residues in this amphipathic molecule are unusually, predominantly anionic and therefore not thought to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The authors provide an excellent structural comparison to the classical AMP, magainin 2, which has a larger hydrophobic face and a predominantly cationic hydrophilic domain (Fig. 5\n).",

However in 50% TFE, the proportion of \u03b1-helical structure increased to 56%; in contrast, the proportion of \u03b2-sheet was reduced to 21%. Molecular modelling of meucin-25 was ambiguous, suggesting that meucin-25 may be able to fold in more than one way.

Only meucin \u221224 showed any cytotoxicity (17% reduction viability of GC-2 cells at 50 mM).

A sequence comparison (Fig. 6\n) between the two peptides shows differences at Phe-2 (Leu), Ala-4 (Lys) and Asn-7 (Gln) (IsCT2 residues in brackets). Helical wheel analysis demonstrates that these differences cause changes within the hydrophilic face of IsCT2, although there is no overall change in charge; this suggests that both overall ionic charge and amphipathic nature, as distinct from specific amino acid residues, are critical for AMP function. Mutation studies on IsCT (Lee et al., 2004) showed the importance of the hydrophobic residue at position 6. Substitution of Trp6 for Ala6 resulted in a remarkable decrease in both antimicrobial and haemolytic activities. Dai and colleagues (Dai et al., 2002) also identified two other peptides in the crude venom, analogous to IsCT and IsCT2 (IsCTf and IsCT2f, respectively). These latter two peptides are thought to be proteolytic products of the parent molecules devoid of the two penultimate amino acids (Leu and Phe-NH2).

Secondary structure predictions suggest that both BmKb1 and BmKn2 have \u03b1-helical regions (amino acids 2\u201316 and 2\u201311 respectively) flanked by two random coils; helical wheel projections demonstrate their amphipathic natures. The shorter and more highly charged BmKn2 is considerably more active than BmKb1 (MICs for Gram-positive organisms were typically 0.4\u20136 \u03bcM for BmKn2 as compared with 9\u201345 \u03bcM for BmKb1; MICs for Gram-negative organisms were typically 1\u201315 \u03bcM for BmKn2, as compared with 10\u201350 \u03bcM for BmKb1). The activity of BmKn2 against 18 strains of multidrug resistant N.gonorrhoeae has recently been analysed via an MTT assay with these strains having an MIC50 value of between 6.9 and 27.6 \u03bcM (Arpornsuwan et al., In Press). This study also noted the C-terminally amidated residue was critical for function with a dramatic decrease in activity observed upon deletion.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed rapid lyses of bacterial cells after mucroporin or mucroporin-M1 treatment, suggesting a membrane disruptive mechanism. Mucroporin M1 has been shown to specifically inhibit RNA viruses, including SARS-corona virus, influenza and measles viruses, presumably by targeting the viral membrane (Li et al., 2011). DNA viruses were not inhibited. The same groups have more recently shown (Zhao et al., 2012) that the peptide inhibits hepatitis B virus replication, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which resulted in the down-regulation of the nuclear hormone transcription factor, HNF4\u03b1.",

The antimicrobial activity profile of imcroporin was very similar to mucroporin; growth of Gram-negative organisms was weakly inhibited (MICs typically >57 \u03bcM) whereas Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin- and penicillin- resistant strains of clinical isolates of S. aureus were more sensitive to the peptide (MICs typically 11\u201330 \u03bcM).

The peptide (single dose, 60 \u03bcg/g, given one hour after intraperitoneal infection with S. aureus) was as effective as vancomycin (60 \u03bcg/g) in curing mice; all mice survived, seven days after treatment. However imcroporin also exhibited significant cytolytic properties against mammalian cell lines and red blood cells, as evidenced by MTT assays and haemolysis assays respectively. Imcroporin (57 \u03bcM) killed between 25 and 100% of kidney and hepatoma cells and haemolysed 70% of human erythrocytes. Kill kinetics and enzyme activity assays of cell supernatants revealed, as with mucroporin, a rapid membrane disruptive mechanism of action.",

The Asian scorpion, Scorpiops tibetanus is one such example and Cao, Li and colleagues (Yuan et al., 2010) have cloned a new antimicrobial peptide gene (StCT1) from S. tibetanus by screening a venom gland cDNA library with IsCT primers. The precursor of StCT1 is characterized by a signal peptide (24 amino acids) followed by a putative mature peptide of 14 residues and finally, an unusual 37-amino acid acidic propeptide at the C-terminus, suggesting that the mature peptide is C-terminally amidated. A synthetic amidated peptide corresponding to the putative mature peptide of StCT1 showed preferential activity towards S. aureus with weak activity towards Gram-negative organisms, in a similar manner to mucroporin and imcroporin. MIC values against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains ranged between 85 and 135 \u03bcM whilst penicillin-resistant strains were more sensitive (MIC 34 \u03bcM). It is interesting to note that although the amidated StC1 peptide has approx 40% homology with IsCT, the latter peptide (in contrast to StC1) has activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.Using the same approach, a StCT2 gene has also been cloned (Cao et al., 2012). A synthetic, amidated 14 amino acid StCT2 peptide, corresponding to the predicted mature peptide, also showed potent activity against S. aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MICs values 3\u201313 \u03bcM). Both StCT1 and StC2 peptides belong to the NDBP -5 family (see Table 1).",

Whole cell patch clamp experiments identified a sharp decrease in ion currents followed by a rapid, partial recovery, when rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells were exposed to either peptide. These electrophysiological experiments were supported by morphological studies, when the surface of DRG cells was transformed from a smooth to a rough state after incubation with peptides.

Both peptides belong to group 5 (Table 1). Meucin-13 has an amidated C-terminal in contrast to meucin-18 which does not. Extensive structural studies have been carried out on both peptides using CD spectroscopy and NMR spectrometry. The CD spectrum of meucin-13 in 50% TFE characterized the peptide as being primarily \u03b1-helical. This was confirmed by NMR, which identified an \u03b1-helical structure between residues 5\u201313 with an unordered N-terminus. Meucin-18 showed similar results to meucin-13, although NMR revealed a more ordered N-terminal structure (Fig. 7\n). This is thought to be due to the presence of alanine at position 6 (meucin-13) instead of phenylalanine (meucin-18). A structurally ordered N-terminus is postulated to be important for biological activity. Gao and colleagues have also suggested that differences in biological potency might be related to differences in the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance between the two meucins due to the more balanced amphipathicity of meucin-18. The C-terminal extension of meucin-18 with a free (charged) carboxy terminus means that overall, meucin-13 is more hydrophobic. This relative increase in hydrophobicity may reduce the biological activity of the latter due to its increased self-association in aqueous solution (see Jiang et al., 2008 for a useful summary of this proposal). Gao and colleagues also noted that meucin-18 has a positively-charged region (adjacent Lys-6 and Lys-11 residues) that could prove crucial for increased interaction with negatively-charged prokaryotic membranes.",

Ctriporin is a 19 amino acid peptide (net charge: +2) with, like many other previously described peptides, an amidated C-terminus that is produced by the post translational cleavage of a 34-residue acidic propeptide.

The first 35 residues of opistoscorpine 1 were noted to have similarity to the cecropins, a family of linear AMP's from the insect Hyalophora cecropia, which have antimicrobial activity and remarkably low haemolytic activity (Holak et al., 1988, Hu et al., 2013). This idea (Zhu and Tytgat, 2004) is supported by the alignment (Fig. 8\n) of cecropin A with the N-terminal regions of 3 other scorpine family peptides (heteroscorpine, panscorpine and opistoscorpine-1). These regions also align well with the two helices of cecropin A determined by NMR (Holak et al., 1988). Mechanistic studies of cysteine constrained peptides such as the scorpines are limited, compared with that of their non-cysteine containing counterparts. To date, no comparable haemolytic or cytolytic studies of the N-terminal regions of scorpines have been published. Because of their noted similarity and low haemolytic activity this should be an attractive and profitable area to revisit.",

There is also high conservation within the hinge region (Fig. 9B). Solid state NMR data of Pin 1 interaction with phospholipid bilayers suggested that the two alpha-helical regions of the peptide cause lipid bilayers to adopt a cubic phase (Nomura et al., 2005). Since the long chain peptides identified in Fig. 9 also have two distinct alpha helices, then it is a likely proposition that these other peptides also promote a cubic phase in lipid bilayers. Taken together, these alignments may provide us with an insight sight into a general mechanism of action of this class of AMP; however studies comparable to that of Pin 1 clearly need to be undertaken before any firm conclusions can be made. Although these long peptides undoubtedly cause membrane disruption, it is very unlikely that they do so by forming pores, simply on the basis of their size. We are therefore left at present with the carpet like model to describe their mechanism of action.",

This has led to the proposal of a new interfacial model for AMP action (Wimley, 2010, Marks et al., 2011), which is a hybrid between the classical carpet model and the more recent toroidal model. The interfacial model consists of three main processes that take place consecutively: (i) an initial electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged bacterial membrane driven by the polar face; (ii) an interaction with the membrane hydrophobic core driven by the peptide hydrophobic face, causing the peptide to insert into the membrane, and (iii) the polar pocket interacts with the phospholipid head groups on the inner membrane leaflet causing negative curvature of this inner membrane (Marks et al., 2011, Bobone et al., 2012).",

However it is well documented that C-terminal amidation increases the biological activity of these short chain cationic peptides and it has been proposed that this is a consequence of an increase in net positive charge (Strandberg et al., 2007). If the helical wheel structures of these peptides are examined (Fig. 10\n), it can be clearly seen that amidation of the negatively charged C-terminal carboxy group lies within the hydrophobic section of the peptide, thus changing the charge distribution of the peptide. However, the slightly longer peptides (e.g imcroporin, mucroporin, ctriporin and BmKb1) have C-terminal amidated residues that lie within the hydrophilic face of the peptide thus changes in charge distribution are less pronounced (Fig. 11\n). This 'rebalancing' of charge between the amphipathic facets of the peptide clearly has implications for biological activity and it poses an interesting question as to what the precise role of this amidation site has on scorpion AMP mechanism of action.",

A LIPS motif found within Pin 2 (Leu-12 to Ser-15), thought important for biological activity, is also found in all four peptides with the exception of a Ser\u2192Ala replacement in Ctriporin (Fig. 12C). Finally, another interesting separate alignment of Pin 2 and meucin-18 revealed the same motif as part of a conserved K(L/I)IPSLF sequence (Fig. 12 D). At present there is little biophysical experimental data to verify whether these identified sequence alignments have any structural importance (and therefore biological significance).

These techniques have also been extensively used to analyse the venoms of various scorpions (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2014). Recent studies have highlighted the abundance of AMP-like molecules within the transcriptomes of numerous scorpion venoms. 25% of all expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from transcripts of the venom gland of Tityus Stigmurus, were related to AMPs (Almeida et al., 2012). Similar results were obtained from an analysis of the venom gland glands of the Egyptian scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013) and the Chinese scorpion, Lychas mucronatus (Ruiming et al., 2010). In this latter study, scorpions were collected from two different and geographically-isolated areas (Yunnan province and Hainan Island) and the data revealed that the relative abundance of ESTs corresponding to AMPs from scorpions collected on Hainan Island (24% total EST population) were double that of scorpions found in Yunnan. This phenomenon has been highlighted previously in mass spectrometry studies where geographical distribution, climate, age and sex have all been integral to the determination of venom components of a number of different scorpion species (e.g. Newton et al., 2007, Abdel-Rahman et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2009).",

Three short chain \u03b1-helical peptides (UyCT1, UyCT3 and UyCT5) were characterized, with amidated C-terminii and sharing 43\u201377% sequence homology with IsCT. Although all three peptides were equally potent against a range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (MICs typically 1\u201325 \u03bcM), they were also cytolytic (50 \u03bcM peptides causing > 81% haemolysis of human erythrocytes). Interestingly, when the N-terminal Gly was removed from either UyCT1 or UyCT2, the hemolytic activity dramatically declined to 7%, although the range of MICs increased in concert. Two scorpine-like peptides and another with homology to Pin-1 were also identified, but no antimicrobial assays have been carried out to date.",

Although no studies have been directed toward decreasing the immunogenicity of AMPs in particular, various general strategies have been examined and could provide useful areas for further AMP research. For example PEGaylation is an approved non-toxic and non-immunogenic procedure by interfering with antibody and/or HLA epitope binding (Jevsevar et al., 2010). Similarly peptide glycosylation also results in decreased immunogenicity through a similar mechanism (von Delwig et al., 2006). PEGaylation has also been shown to increase the stability of AMPs in the presence of proteases (Falciani et al., 2014) as well as decrease toxicity and increase biocompatibility (Morris et al., 2012). Conjugation of peptides to IgG has also been carried out to successfully evade the adult immune system (Zambidas and Scott 1996) and is a strategy employed within clinical practise for the delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally modification of a peptide sequence to delete potential T-cell epitopes have also been examined (De Groot 2007). Therefore while a number of different strategies are available to improve stability and reduce immunogenicity, it is important to emphasize that the central goal of any strategy should be to maintain beneficial biological activity.",

Another attractive strategy would be to use AMP cocktail therapy (Luna-Ramirez et al., 2014). These authors increased the therapeutic index of several UyCT scorpion venom peptides.

In terms of both speed and scope of peptide identification through MS/MS techniques and the establishment of dedicated databases of fragmentation patterns, to the prediction of biological activity via bioinformatics, it is certainly an approach to be given serious consideration. However when one considers the many hundreds (over a thousand?) of antimicrobial peptides characterised in the last twenty years, the lack of any really new therapeutic anti-microbial agents is singularly depressing. We must therefore recognize that the approach of the \u201cgatherers\u201d, presently in vogue, has one crucial intellectual limitation- you only get what you are looking for and is in essence a recipe for identifying more of the same. The alternative approach of the \u201chunter\u201d may be more time consuming but one can argue that an investment in functional assays is the only way to identify truly novel compounds. One particular striking example of this is the identification of the bactridines (Diaz et al., 2009) whose proposed mechanism of action is far removed from membrane active AMPs, indeed would not be considered a conventional target in other streams of antibiotic development. Such serendipitous breakthroughs should be a lesson to us all.",

Such experimental methods, taken together with molecular techniques to determine potential intracellular targets (e.g. Brogden, 2005) and not forgetting that AMPs also have antiviral activities (e.g. Zhao et al., 2012), are crucial if our ultimate goal of using antimicrobial peptides as next generation therapeutics is to be realised.",
