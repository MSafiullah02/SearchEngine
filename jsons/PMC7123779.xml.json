The influenza virus belongs to the genera Orthomyxoviridae and causes an acute respiratory tract illness in children and adults. Influenza undergoes frequent and extensive genetic changes, allowing for a yearly seasonal pattern of recurrent infections along with the development of novel subtypes that have the potential to create larger pandemics. More recently, avian subtypes have begun to cause disease in humans who have had direct contact with infected birds. Unfortunately, resistance to antiviral agents has emerged over the last few years. Influenza is one of the most influential viruses in history, and will undoubtedly continue to affect public health and challenge clinicians and policymakers in the future.",

Influenza C causes rare human disease, mostly in children. Influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome. The eight RNA segments of the genome encode for 11 viral proteins, including the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2), matrix proteins (M1, M2), and the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuroaminidase (NA) (Table 1). Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of the HA and NA glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified and are found in 144 different combinations (e.g., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) (Table 1) [1, 2].\n\n",

The NA glycoprotein allows the spread of the virus by cleaving the glycosidic linkages to sialic acid on the host cells and the surface of the virus. The virus is then spread via bodily fluids or through direct contact with secretions. Viral synthesis and release occurs for approximately 12\u201324 h, and then eventual cell death occurs due to cessation of host protein synthesis and cell-mediated apoptosis driven by the influenza infection [2].",

Like other RNA viruses, the Influenza A viruses lack proofreading ability and are therefore subject to point mutations. These individual mutations in the viral genome cause minor changes in the antigenic character of the virus, with amino acid changes in HA and NA of principal importance. This drift occurs as the virus travels and replicates through a susceptible population. Subsequent disease caused by a new strain created from antigenic drift is less severe than with a novel strain, as partial immunity within the population often remains, but the extent of the seasonal epidemic varies yearly [2\u20134].",

The three major pandemics that have occurred in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, and 1968 H3N2) have been associated with reassortment. As Influenza A is host-specific, a less specific host, or \u201cmixing vessel,\u201d that is more susceptible to all subtypes is required. Pigs, which possess receptors for both the human and avian subtypes, are a traditional \u201cmixing vessel,\u201d but any species, including humans and wildlife, can potentially play a similar role. In the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) pandemics, a pig was implicated as the intermediate host for viral \u201cmixing\u201d of two strains. Recent infections of humans with avian subtypes of Influenza A (e.g., H5N1) have heightened concerns that humans can function as a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d after direct infection from birds [2\u20134].",

The virulence factors responsible for severe disease outbreaks are becoming better understood. First, the binding location may determine the extent of local inflammation and severity of disease. Human virus subtypes H1, H2, and H3 bind to \u03b1-2,6 linkages found in human upper respiratory epithelium. Humans also have a smaller number of \u03b1-2,3 linkages, mostly located in their lower respiratory tract and conjunctivae; these are the preferred binding sites of the avian subtypes. Thus, binding of an avian subtype is more likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract and thus presents as pneumonia rather than as upper respiratory symptoms (Table 2) [5]. Second, local and systemic cytokine release varies with subtypes. In a mouse model of an engineered 1918 H1N1, significantly higher levels of specific cytokines, most notably IL-2, IL-6, and TNF were found locally and systemically [1, 5]. Additionally, the NS1 protein, which antagonizes host cell interferon, appears to have had increased activity. These characteristics of the deadly 1918 virus have also been found with the most recent severe human infections with influenza caused by the avian subtype H5N1 [1]. Finally, influenza viral replication is usually limited largely to the respiratory tract, but in some subtypes (e.g., H5N1) viremia has been detected, adding to the burden of disease [5].\n\n",

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as any influenza that causes severe disease or death in domestic poultry. HPAI viruses, with very few exceptions, are of the H5 or H7 subtype, but not all H5 and H7 subtypes are HPAI viruses. The potential pathogenicity of H5 and H7 subtypes can be evaluated by sequencing the HA gene, since pathogenicity is associated with the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site (Table 2). A change from a low pathogenic H5 or H7 subtype to a highly pathogenic form may occur upon introduction into poultry and is thought to occur primarily as a result of insertion of basic amino acids in the HA cleavage site. Molecular studies have shown that the 1918 human pandemic H1N1 subtype originated as a low pathogenic avian virus. In contrast, current human cases of H5N1 worldwide are the result of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.",

This leads to extensive local inflammation with neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the sub-epithelium of the respiratory tract. Particularly with avian subtypes, this leads to a hemophagocytic syndrome and severe diffuse alveolar damage, causing the clinical findings of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Within the alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes, MHC I upregulation leads to antigen presentation of the hemagglutinin and other subcapsular proteins. This eventually leads to natural killer cell destruction of infected cells and the development of neutralizing antibodies (largely against HA) by day 14 of infection. When compared to human subtypes H1 and H3, infection with avian subtype H5N1 appears to infect lower respiratory tract cells, inhibit NK cell function, deplete lymphocytes, inhibit MHC class I upregulation, and inhibit cell apoptosis [2].",

Only a few cases of self-limiting conjunctivitis were reported in patients in each country, at the time of a poultry outbreak. The patients had each had contact with a sick bird without the appropriate protective equipment. Then, in 1997, a large-scale HPAI H5N1 outbreak occurred among poultry in Hong Kong farms and markets, and direct human disease occurred, with 18 documented human cases and 6 fatalities. Two subsequent poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1999 and 2003 with HPAI H5N1 occurred without human cases until 2003, when two members of a family in Hong Kong contracted HPAI H5N1. In December of 2003, HPAI H5N1 surfaced in poultry in Korea and China, and from 2003 to 2006 the poultry outbreak spread worldwide.

Two cases of conjunctivitis caused by subtype H7N3, a low pathogenicity strain, occurred among poultry workers during a Canadian outbreak in 2004. Finally, in 1999 and again in 2003, Influenza A subtype H9N2 caused a mild, self-limiting respiratory infection in children during a poultry outbreak.

Thus far, human-to-human transmission has occurred in a few cases and with poor efficiency. During the 1997 HPAI H5N1 Hong Kong outbreak, one household contact of an ill poultry worker became infected.

During the 2003 worldwide HPAI H5N1 outbreak, two family clusters were suspected, and in 2004 one case of daughter to mother transmission was confirmed in Thailand. An additional family cluster from Indonesia with eight infections from a single source was also suspected in 2007 [1]. Three subsequent studies of health-care workers in Thailand, Vietnam, and China all showed not nosocomial transmission. Finally, in 2003 during the H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands, three cases of household contacts with minimal disease were reported [1, 6].",

Primary influenza pneumonia occurs when influenza directly infects the lower respiratory tract, with the disease usually being relatively severe. Those with cardiac and underlying pulmonary disease, such as obstructive lung disease, are the most susceptible to primary pneumonia. Secondary pneumonia, which is more common than primary pneumonia, occurs when bacteria invade and infect the lower respiratory tract after loss of the upper respiratory tract cilia\u2019s natural clearance mechanism. The most common complicating bacterial pathogens are Pneumococcus, Haemophilis influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Over the past few years, methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has become an increasing factor. Clinically, patients with a secondary bacterial pneumonia often improve from their initial influenza and then subsequently worsen, as the secondary bacterial pneumonia worsens. Bacterial pneumonia following an influenza infection accounts for over 25% of all influenza-related deaths. Other complications of influenza include myositis, rhabdomylitis, encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [2, 7].",

However, due to the low levels, no adjustment for renal dysfunction is required. In clinical studies with zanamivir administered twice daily for 5 days, the median time to alleviation of influenza symptoms was 1 day shorter compared to placebo [12, 13]. This occurred for both Influenza A and B but was dependent on time of administration. Benefit was seen when zanamivir was given within 30 h of the onset of symptoms. No benefit was demonstrated if administered after 30 h. Studies in immunocompromised hosts and in patients with severe cases of influenza were not performed, so in those settings where viral shedding and disease may last beyond 48 h, zanamivir may have some theoretical benefit. In high-risk patients, the development of influenza complications, especially asthma and bacterial pneumonia, was also diminished. The major side effect of zanamivir was asthma and bronchospasm and thus the drug should be used with caution in those with underlying lung disease.",

The reduction of symptoms appeared to be greater in laboratory-confirmed Influenza A when compared to Influenza B. Complications, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis media, were lowered by as much as 50% in adults and children. Antibiotic use also was reduced in the oseltamivir group. As with zanamivir, oseltamivir is well tolerated, with only 15% of patients reporting nausea. In the past few years, particularly in pediatric cases from Japan, delirium and self-injury, including suicide, have been reported [8, 10].

In fact, the CDC currently does not recommend the use of the adamantanes unless susceptibility is known, such as in a focal outbreak. Resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine occurs through a single point mutation, leading to high-level resistance that confers to the entire class. Initially, resistance sometimes developed during therapy, starting as early as day 2\u20133 of drug administration. However, most recently, the CDC reported that 92% of Influenza A (H3N2) isolates in 2006 were resistant to adamantanes [10, 11]. All of the resistant isolates had a substitution at codon 31 of the M2 protein. This widespread resistance has developed from adamantane overuse in the clinical settings as well as use in poultry outbreaks over the years, thus nearly rendering this class useless [14, 15].",

Resistance occurs with amino acid substitutions at either the NA or HA site. With NA mutations, a substitution of glutamine to glycine at position 119 in Influenza A and 117 in Influenza B results in decreased binding affinity at the NA active site. Cross-resistance is variable with this mutation, as resistance to oseltamivir was not conferred to zanamivir; when conferred, it has led to tenfold increase in the inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this mutation has yielded decreased viral infectivity and binding ability that was subsequently demonstrated in animal models [15]. Changes in the HA at or near the sialic acid binding site alter the viral binding and decrease the viral dependence on the NA. This change confers class resistance, as HA mutations to oseltamivir during treatment lead to a tenfold increase in the inhibitory concentrations of zanamivir. The development of resistance appears to be related to prolonged viral replication and shedding. In a few cases in high-risk patients (bone marrow transplant), therapy with oseltamivir led to resistance after receipt of the drug for 2 weeks, with two NA mutations and an M2 mutation conferring a 1,000-fold increase in zanamivir inhibitor concentrations. After therapy was terminated, the NA mutation disappeared but the M2 change persisted. Thus, therapy with prolonged viral shedding in certain hosts (e.g., immunocompromised) may lead to multiple mutations at the NA and HA sites, increasing resistance. However, thus far, there is no evidence that these mutations persist in the community [14, 15].",

Both the World Health Organization and the CDC estimate the strains available for vaccine development. Two major types of vaccines currently exist: an inactivated compound (TIV) and a live attenuated virus (LAIV). Both types of vaccines are trivalent, in that they contain the HA and NA for two Influenza A strains (H1N1, H3N2) and one Influenza B strain. The inactivated vaccine contains either whole virus or subvirion products, which are designed to ensure the presentation of a relevant HA and NA to the immune system. Inactivated influenza vaccine is given intramuscularly. The live attenuated virus is different as it is developed from a cold-adapted attenuated virus that contains the reassorted HA and NA of the selected strains. The LIV is administered by nasal mist spray and subsequently leads to replication of the virus in the distal upper respiratory tract (cold adaptation area). Thus, immunity develops through infection and subsequent antigen presentation [16, 17].",

Mortality reduction in the elderly was not demonstrated in an individual study, but a meta-analysis suggested a slight reduction in the vaccination group [19]. Other at-risk groups, including patients with HIV infection or other chronic underlying diseases, receiving, immunosuppression, or experiencing pregnancy, have not been well studied in randomized trials and vaccine efficacy is more difficult to determine.

In household contacts, influenza significantly reduced the rates of influenza (4% vs. 16%) when compared to placebo.

Complications and death are highest in the elderly, children under 6 months, and high-risk individuals.Due to genetic changes, new strains of influenza emerge constantly, thus creating the possibility of a pandemic. Additional changes in the last two decades include the increased infection in humans by avian subtypes with high morbidity and mortality.Treatment of influenza is supportive, and if given early, antiviral treatment can reduce symptom time and complications. Due to recent emergence of widespread resistance to adamantanes, only the neuraminidase inhibitor class is currently recommended for treatment.Vaccination against influenza is the mainstay for prevention, with the elderly, children, and high-risk groups recommended for vaccination. Both inactivated and live attenuated virus vaccines are available. Prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors can provide protection in high-risk groups.\n",
