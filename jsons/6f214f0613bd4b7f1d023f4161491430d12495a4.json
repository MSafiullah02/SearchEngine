The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM-SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country's response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed $",

            "text": "The world population is being rapidly infected by the SARS-COV-2 virus pandemic, also known as Covid-19 [1] . This virus has spread very fast throughout the countries, with a very high contagion rate, reaching all continents in just over three months since the first confirmed case in Asia [2] . The numbers have grown exponentially reaching, approximately, more than 3.7 million cases and more than a quarter of a million deaths. Distancing and social isolation rules have been used as the only alternative in order to contain the progress of the disease. The flattening of the virus spreading curve that can be modeled according to several approaches [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is the first goal strictly related to the rules mentioned. If this does not happen, the number of deaths would skyrocket, as it was recently experimented in countries such as the US, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK. Several warnings about this have been spread in the literature, for example, in the beginning of March 2020, Fanelli [3] explained that: \"In Italy and in other countries that will be facing the epidemic surge soon, this is quite possibly only achievable through a cooperative and disciplined effort of the population as a whole\". Successful example of curve flattening have already been seen in Portugal, Germany and South Korea, among others. Other countries, such as New Zealand, managed to limit the spread by completely closing their borders and imposing a complete lock-down to their people. In these countries, the counter-measures provide a certain breath to governments in order to allow the health systems of each country to meet local needs, or to be able to wait for other solutions, such as the development of vaccines (not yet existing so far for the SARS-CoV-2 virus). The medical solutions to minimize or stop the pandemic include in-silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [8] , aiming to study its weaknesses in an attempt to better understanding it and to develop treatments and vaccines.",

We argue that a data driven technique can be used to infer the pandemic dynamics from raw data, including future events such as the date of the peak, number of cases and deaths, and the end of the pandemic. Based on this initial assumption, this work tests and validates the possibility of using artificial intelligence tools, mainly the ones based on deep learning, to create models of dissemination and to predict the numbers in different regions, which can be used alternatively or in addition to traditional models [5, 7, 6] . We discuss our results in comparison to those obtained with traditional methods and found that they work at least with the same precision in predicting the pandemics events. A preliminary study was carried out in Italy, based on China data with satisfactory results, but with space for improvement [9, 13] . An approach based on LSTM has been initially tested by our team in Brazil, and demonstrated problems that are discussed in Section 2.2.",

The MAE, which demonstrated better results than the preliminary LSTM approach, is chosen and reported as our working model for predicting data from Brazilian states, working at www.natalnet.br/covid. In order to overcome problems as data non-linearity and lack of data due to under notification, we propose an initial clustering of the different countries data, based on Early Mortality, Days until 10x, and Early Acceleration features. Then, different prediction networks are trained within each cluster, using countries that have a more advanced stage of the pandemic than Brazil, e.g. China, Italy, Spain, and the United States. Each networks is then used to make predictions on the Brazilian states belonging to the cluster on which it was trained. We do not have a way to do comparison with traditional approaches, because the pandemics is still in a growing situation in Brazil.

These dynamics can vary across different regions as they depend on parameters such as pollution, demographic density, average age of the population, among others. Analyzing the actions taken to fight the virus, in both the social and economic spheres, there is a need for more realistic epidemiological data. Indeed, the use of local models, taking into account the reality of each region, state or municipality, can allow the authorities to take coherent decisions. Therefore, it is assumed that the spread of the virus follows some statistical model, which parameters can be tuned to represent different situations.",

In these approaches, the phase transitions of the disease are modeled as instantaneous rates in differential equations or as probabilities of transition in discrete time differences or matrix equations. These models provide accurate estimates of the position of the equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of the time an individual spends at each stage; therefore, they do not accurately capture the transitory dynamics of epidemics. Actually, the SEIR model has been tested at Italy [6] to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. It has been shown to underestimate peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and to substantially overestimate the persistence of the epidemic after the peak has passed [5] .",

Despite somehow representing the Covid-19 dynamics, some of these traditional models (SIR, SEIR, SEITR, SEIRD) must be improved so that they can be applied with higher precision to the study of the new virus, as they have been shown to present some issues on the recent works cited above. In this work, besides discussing the main advances of the contributions in this direction, these traditional models are compared to ours, which is a data driven approach. Some preliminary studies on the above methods have been conducted for better understanding of the Covid-19 dynamics. In fact, we verified that it is a virus that cannot be model perfectly with any specific traditional model because of the influence of several factors on its dissemination speed. Mainly, it is difficult to model its behavior because of the non-linearity of infection data caused by under-notifications and also the lack of effective and constant counter measures, which changes all the time as the infection spreads. For these reasons, it seems appealing to apply AI-based methods. As a first test, we start by implementing an LSTM, one of the default neural network models for analyzing time series data, in the next section.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a family of architectures containing recurring feedback connections, which define an internal state, or short-term memory. This memory makes them suitable for modeling sequential or time series data [17] . To this end, a standard RNN keeps a vector of activation parameters at each time step, especially when short-term dependencies are included in the input data. However, when trained with gradient descent algorithms, learning the long-term dependencies that are encoded in data becomes difficult due to the vanishing gradient problem. This is solved using a specialized neuron for long-term memory that keeps a constant reverse flow in the error signal, allowing it to learn long-term dependencies.

In order to overcome this problem, other RNN architectures based on LSTM have been created. We tested two approaches proposed by Sagheer: DLSTM [19] and LSTM-SAE [17] , early responses. In this way, smaller specialized networks can be trained for each cluster, and we hope that, by learning on more consistent data, our models could generalize better without overfitting to the training data.

This picture is shown in Figure 7 , also available from their website (http://astro.dfte.ufrn.br/html/Cliente/COVID19.php).

Generally, states from cluster 1 presents a steep peak with an elevated number of daily cases, meaning that the transmission dynamics is happening much faster than cluster 0.

There are some explanations for this lower performance. The first issue is related to data non-linearity caused by under sampling (every other day and then every day for example) and under notifications (numbers under real values), which have also been problematic for other countries than Brazil. Several countries are under-testing their population, making the number of reported cases below reality. Even for the countries that are doing massive testing, there are often delays between the real occurrences and notification. Another potential source of error is the randomization of the weights, which can be solved with LSTM-SAE [17] , however the first issue still remains a problem here (non-linearity problem). Yet, instability has been acknowledged during training. Several attempts had to be done in order to get a more stable model by manually tuning a fixed initialization seed.",

In particular, an LSTM creates an embedding that transforms the function into a linear we conjecture that the input data can be considered quasi-linear (somehow between nonlinear and linear) and that it obeys a certain pattern, otherwise no model could approximate it. The limited latent space is also a problem, even more for the long sequences as it is the case here. Besides modeling well the long-term memories, it fails in regularizing for other sequences with different properties [27] . That is to say that if a certain situation (lock-down or distancing) is kept, thus it could perform better. Besides, the problem of learning long-term dependencies remains as one of the main challenges in deep learning [27] . A last problem with LSTM is that the time series has to be stationary and with stable mean, an assumption that does not hold with the data that we analyzed in this paper.",

Then, we used the deep learning MAE approach to train a neural network guided by this clustering. This approach worked better, verified at the end by fitting approximating curves to the dynamics of each Brazilian state, in order to verify or ratify the peaks.",

Data Processing Lets consider the epidemic curve a time-series that models the advance of an epidemic by measuring the number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on a daily basis. Hence, we first apply a moving average filter of size 3 to deal with the variability of data related to the amount of tests available and delays in reporting between other problems. We compute the input examples by dividing the whole epidemic curve in overlapped segments of 8 days, shifted one day from each other, with the 9th day being the value to be forecast by the MAE. Each example is normalized by dividing its values by its maximum value. A set of 10 examples is taken from the most advanced places in each cluster to form a batch of examples.",

In fact, it is argued that the shape of a normal distribution is a histogram that is a transformation of probability density against values of a single variable while the Covid-19 contagion curve is a transformation of the values of one variable (confirmed cases) according to a second variable (time). So the curve is not a distributions in the sense usually meant in probability and statistics. Nonetheless, one can visually notice that the curve of daily confirmed cases \u00d7 time (day) looks like a distorted Gaussian, and can actually be approximated by some distributions such as the normal (rarely), pearson, logistic, logNormal, and gamma, among others.
