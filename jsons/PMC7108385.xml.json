The United States alone generates eight million search queries for health-related information daily [11]. The analysis of digital data, such as Google search queries, has been used to monitor communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as mental health, illegal drug use, health policy impact, and behaviours with potential health implications [11]. In addition, social media is an easily approachable, highly cost-effective and interoperable system, that provides real-time online data with high geographical resolution that can be systematically mined, aggregated and analysed to inform public health agents [13].",

Event-based Internet biosurveillance systems are systems that use information on events impacting human health or the economy from Internet sources, instantaneously incorporating diverse streams of data [14]. They contain the event-based component described above, but with the Internet as the means for data sources, processes, and dissemination and analysis of health information stored digitally. The data reported is aggregated and visualised in real-time, which enables immediate feedback to the users, the public, and officials [15]. Several surveillance systems use non-structured, event-based, digital data, such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Health Network (GPHIN), which detected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) more than two months before the first publications by the World Health Organization (WHO) [11].",

News aggregates collect articles and news from sources, aggregates them, either by location or topic, and filters them. The result is provided as an Rich Site Summary (RSS) feed. Automatic systems further advance systems like news aggregators by adding a series of steps of analysis [9]. Non-moderated systems can search the web and display new articles without time delay in an unbiased manner than moderated systems [16]. Often, the data is not structured or collated, and therefore epidemiologists must spend more time and energy determining their relevance to a specific situation of interest [9]. Moderated systems rely on some component of human input or analysis, either solely, or after data is first processed automatically [9]. Moderated systems offer a chance of screening for relevance by public health practitioners before it is disseminated [9]. Thereby, moderated systems might show less irrelevant news items, fewer false positives than the non-moderated systems, but are subject to moderator bias [16]. Systems without human moderation often focus on data sources that already have been validated and, therefore, do not help aid those interested in the early warning and alert potential for unknown or new outbreaks or diseases [9].",
