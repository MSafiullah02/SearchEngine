Selection of these triggers is often based on anecdotal observations based on historical incidence or monitoring of local or regional influenza activity. Practical challenges to implementing seasonal policies may provide motivation for healthcare sites to decrease the duration of these periods as soon as possible while still controlling infection spread. Increased personal protective equipment is expensive and often unpopular among healthcare workers, patients, and visitors, which can be found documented in the personal protective equipment compliance literature.6 Efficient selection of the intervention periods would be financially savvy for hospitals and clinics while maximizing patient protection. Increased numbers of patients during respiratory season drive the need for hospitals to add additional staff (traveling nurses) to be able to provide safe care. Administration has the challenge of when to bring in temporary support and how long to retain them each year. Predicting the increase in seasonal respiratory illness season would enable them to limit the time for the contract and potentially decrease the expense.",

Other research has used thresholds in order to characterize influenza incidence into low, moderate, and high categories using a \u201cMoving Epidemic Method\u201d, which uses maximum accumulated rates percentage (MAP) based on incidence rates per 100 000 inhabitants, or consultations.15, 16 This approach characterizes the intensity of influenza epidemics and can also trigger enhanced protective interventions, but is intended to be used on a larger scale than that available at even the largest hospital sites. The most common algorithms that are designed to trigger interventions during an outbreak are CUSUM\u2010based methods and their variants,17, 18 the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA),19, 20 and the space\u2010time permutation scan statistic model.21, 22 All of these methods involve detections of deviations from expected values, or threshold values, based on historical data.

This prevents an ALERT period from being prematurely terminated by early season fluctuations around the trigger threshold. Additionally, to account for reporting delays and possible delays in implementation of any policies, the user may specify a lag period: a number of time periods between the reporting date associated with the trigger and the date the ALERT period becomes effective. For instance, lag periods may be helpful in tuning ALERT to accommodate a municipal or state health department wanting to implement an increased upper respiratory protection program that needs to wait for reporting from area hospital or requires time to distribute or set up the intervention.

The ALERT period would have covered 5.7% more patients over an equivalent median D\ns, and saved the hospital a total of 10.4 weeks of intervention time. Furthermore, ALERT would have triggered during the onset of the H1N1 epidemic in 2009, demonstrating that it provides useful information both in seasonal outbreaks settings as well as anomalous pandemic scenarios. Neither \u03c4s=6 or \u03c4s=21 offered a clear benefit over the periods that were implemented in reality. When \u03c4s=6, the median X\ns was 95%, but with a concomitant increase in median D\ns by 3.5 weeks.

The CUSUM method was calibrated on the training dataset to produce a median intervention period of 19 weeks, similar to the ALERT and observational methods. In both the training and testing datasets, CUSUM did not capture as many cases as the other two methods, however, in the training dataset CUSUM captured the smallest number of low weeks.

Multiple peaks during a season are common in data of mixed upper respiratory disease incidences, or even for data containing multiple strains of the same disease, where peak timing can vary. The respective heights of the peaks do not affect which one triggers the ALERT period. If a season contains two or more separate peaks, the first peak will trigger the ALERT period if the peak incidence exceeds the threshold value. If the threshold selected by the user is too high, the second peak may be missed if the nadir incidence drops below the trigger before the onset of the second peak. As ALERT was intended to apply to seasonal infectious diseases, users should proceed with caution if their data contains regular patterns of multiple peaks that they wish to capture. Likewise, users should consider recalculating potential thresholds yearly as their training dataset grows, which should help to refine the best target threshold value for their specific application.",

While many large healthcare facilities track incidences of lab\u2010confirmed infectious diseases, smaller facilities may not currently have the capacity for multiyear incidence recordkeeping. While there is some evidence from performance on the influenza A, influenza B, and RSV combined dataset that ALERT may be used on symptom based rather than lab\u2010confirmed illness, this has not been studied directly to date. If only a few years of historical data is available for a site, the reliability of ALERT's triggers may be in doubt and the threshold trigger should be recalibrated by repeated ALERT runs as additional data becomes available. Likewise, in real data, as opposed to simulated data, we should expect that seasonality parameters may vary over time. Some of the inter\u2010season variability we observed may be due to temporal differences in these parameters. ALERT was intended for use with strongly seasonal datasets but can accommodate some variability in these parameters. Our observations in this paper show that inconsistency resulting in occasional multiple peaks may be problematic. Likewise, differences in simulation parameters between the training and testing seasons in the simulated data would likely result in reduced ALERT performance, which is why we recommend recalibrating the chosen threshold to new data when it becomes available. The duration of recorded historical data needed to derive useful trigger thresholds will likely vary based on seasonality and randomness characteristics of the historical data. ALERT relies on the assumption that past respiratory illness seasons will be similar to the future, which is why it performs well on seasonal data. We can observe in the more random and less seasonal simulations and in 2009 of the real data that violations of this assumption will impact ALERT's performance. ALERT will stop with an error message if the data is not a good fit for the program, either due to unclear peak patterns or increasing or decreasing baseline. Future studies should compare the performance of ALERT to the other threshold\u2010based methodologies for outbreak detection.",
