Paradoxically, the exponential increase in the number of articles over years led to an asymptotic evolution that rarely reaches the implementation of telemedicine in daily practice and policy [1] . The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for health practice faced several challenges explaining why many telemedicine projects fail to scale-up, despite the technical advances made since the term \"telemedicine\" was coined about 50 years ago. Then, will this pandemic trigger a deep implementation of telemedicine never seen earlier?",

Over time, the digitalization in telecommunications and the progressively wider access to the Internet offered an opportunity to reorganize healthcare services. The increase of data transmission and storage capacity, as well as the evolution of mHealth with the development of wireless communications, provided us a broad range of easy-to-use devices adaptable to many aspects of our practice remotely. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial intelligence and Big data to analyze massive volumes of information could potentially improve healthcare systems to facilitate tailored medicine.",

Moreover, the efficacy of telemedicine on health outcomes is inconsistent across different programs used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and their value is difficult to establish when only few economic data are available.",

As other disasters, the pandemic leads to a surge in demand for healthcare services, which directly and indirectly could collapse health systems. To solve this problem, telemedicine offers two main advantages. On the one hand, the classical benefit of providing healthcare at a distance may serve to start-up efficient triage services without exposure to SARS-CoV2 [2] . On the other hand, components like tele-education and telemonitoring that provide action plans can promote patients\u00b4 empowerment and self-management. The combination of these two benefits could alleviate our previously overwhelmed healthcare capabilities not only during the pandemic, but also in our daily practice. In this sense, our research group developed a web-based platform called TECCU (\"Telemonitorizaci\u00f3n de la Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa\" or Telemonitoring of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). In a previous pilot trial, TECCU showed to be a safe strategy to improve health outcomes of complex IBD patients [3] , with a high probability of being more cost-effective in the short term compared to standard care and telephone care [4] . In view of these results, a new project in collaboration with other hospitals and investigators from the Spanish Working Group on Crohn\u00b4s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU) and the confederation of associations for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis of Spain (ACCU) is currently underway (Image 1).",

Second, those organizations that previously investigated the value of telemedical innovations should lead this revolution [6] , with the collaboration between centers and regions to develop the European health strategies. Third, institutions lacking telemedicine programs can outsource these services, but the provision of remote health safely also requires a uniform legal framework regarding medical liability.

It is possible to use telephone to perform triage and clinical appointments.Many centers count on telephone and email helplines, ideally attended by specialized nurses, to answer patients\u00b4 queries regarding treatment, the risk of infection or the IBD itself. In centers that previously implemented mature telemedicine programs, these new tools may offer personalized follow-up and multidisciplinary advice, even using automated algorithms (with the providers\u00b4 support) to standardize practice patterns. If accessible, new systems can include point of care (PoC) fecal calprotectin testing in combination with validated patient reported outcomes.IBD represents a heterogeneous group of disorders mostly affecting young individuals in their optimal period of personal and professional development. The use of ICTs is a to manage these patients, but telemedicine mainly focused on other chronic conditions such as depression, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases. The development of more sophisticated telemedicine programs and PoC testing over the last years provides additional value to remote follow-up in the IBD context, improving the ability to cover different patients\u00b4 profiles more objectively.",
