            "text": "Carbonaceous and carbon-based nanomaterials have been attracting a significant research interest because of their exclusive characteristics, including good biocompatibility, non-toxicity, high mechanical/thermal properties, and relative ease of functionalization (Iravani 2011; Iravani and Varma 2019a, b; Mohammadinejad et al. 2016 Mohammadinejad et al. , 2019 Varma 2012 Varma , 2014a Varma , b, 2016 Varma , 2019 . Carbon dots are referred to as fluorescent carbon due to their strong characteristics which up on comparison with the traditional fluorescent dyes exhibit superior fluorescence including photostability, resistance to photobleaching and non-blinking (Xu et al. 2004 ). Additionally, carbon dots have promising characteristics, including water solubility, low toxicity, high chemical stability, easy derivatization. Due to all these unique traits, carbon dots have found important and widespread applications in biotechnology, energy, catalysis, biological labeling, bioimaging, and gene/drug delivery ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) (Baker and Baker 2010; Shen et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2013b) . For instance, thermally reduced carbon dot-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor was fabricated for sensitive, costeffective, simple, and selective determination of vitamin B12 (~ 1-12 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ) in aqueous solutions ). Additionally, uniform oxygen and sulfur co-doped graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots were produced with significant blue photoluminescence, and good stability which can be applied for cellular imaging with acceptable biocompatibility, and exhibited potential as fluorescent probe for bioimaging and biosensing purposes (Lu et al. 2015) .",

Surface passivation is usually attained by the production of a thin insulating layer of oligomeric polyethylene glycol on an acid-treated carbon dot surface; high fluorescence intensities and high quantum yield of carbon dots can be achieved with an effective surface passivation (Lim et al. 2015) . For instance, carbon quantum dots were prepared with quantum yields as high as 60% via passivation with polyethylene glycol 1500N . Additionally, polyethylenimine , boronic acid (Shen and Xia 2014) , NH 2 -polyethylene-glycol and N-acetyllcysteine (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2010 ) have been applied for functionalizing carbon dots for application in gene delivery and bioimaging, blood sugar sensing and Hg(II) sensing .",

Additionally, the other preparative strategies have been suggested, including plasma treatment (Jiang et al. 2009 ), supported synthesis (Bourlinos et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Zong et al. 2011) , solution chemistry approaches (Wang et al. 2011a; Hamilton et al. 2011; Mueller et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011) , and cage-opening of fullerenes (Lu et al. 2011 ). The produced carbon dots, regardless of their (Feng et al. 2015a) production techniques, have a mix of sizes, which needs complex separation techniques to obtain mono-dispersed carbon dots. Some of the explored post-synthesis separation techniques include dialysis (Liu et al. 2007 ), chromatography (Li et al. 2010a; Vinci et al. 2012) , gel electrophoresis (Tao et al. 2012) , and ultra-filtration (Zheng et al. 2013) . In this critical review, eco-friendly and sustainable fabrication of carbon and graphene quantum dots as well as their important biomedical and biotechnological applications are highlighted. The pros and cons and critical issues pertaining to the deployment of sustainable and eco-friendly strategies for manufacturing these quantum dots, with inherent advantages including non-toxicity, environmental friendliness, novelty, simplicity, greenness and cost-effectiveness, are discussed.",

Both carbon and graphene quantum dots are effective in photon-harvesting in short-wavelength region because of \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of C = C bonds. They typically exhibit strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region (~ 260-320 nm), with a tail extending into the visible range. The absorption located in 230-270 nm is typically attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of C = C bonds, and the peak/shoulder located around 300-390 nm is ascribed to n-\u03c0* transition of C = O bonds. Generally, carbon quantum dots are relatively more efficient in absorption of long wavelengths and have low quantum yield, thus requiring a surface passivation layer for improvement of their brightness. In comparison, graphene quantum dots usually offer higher quantum yield compared to carbon dots because of their layered structure and better crystallinity Zhu et al. 2015) . Differently colored carbon dots have been synthesized, ranging from ultraviolet to red, and most commonly, blue and Sharma and Das (2019) green. Undesirable for multi-color imaging, most of these carbon dots display broad emission spectra because of the large heterogeneity (in size and chemical composition) originating from poorly controllable synthesis processes .",

Furthermore, alterations in fluorescence of carbon quantum dots were applied for detecting various numbers of inorganic molecules (Pooja et al. 2017) . As an example, the detection of NO 2 gas was achieved by using quantum dot-functionalized aerogels as the sensing probes wherein they revealed significant fluorescence activities in the solid state.

For instance, in vitro studies have revealed the low cytotoxicity of graphene quantum dots, which was credited to their significant oxygen content and ultra-small size. Additional in vivo biodistribution assay using mice showed no graphene quantum dots accumulations in the main organs and fast clearance of graphene quantum dot via kidney. Notably, injections with graphene quantum dot and graphene oxide showed that graphene quantum dots had no noticeable influences on mice; differently, the graphene oxide revealed some toxicity, even initiating death because of the in vivo aggregations of graphene oxide. In another study, the effect of functional groups on the cytotoxicity of graphene quantum dots was ascertained by comparing their ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Consequently, it was revealed that ketonic carbonyl groups had noticeable effect on reactive oxygen species formation ability of graphene quantum dots. Thus, removing oxygen functional groups on graphene quantum dots could improve the photostability and reduce the cytotoxicity, which provided molecular level indication for the better design of biocompatible graphene quantum dots. Because of their remarkable biocompatibility, graphene quantum dots with a large number of oxygencontaining groups were effectively applied as operative nano-radio-sensitizer for radiotherapy.",

The resulting fluorescent intensity change produced a signal for target microRNA detection with satisfied discrimination abilities in a wide detection range from 0.1 to 200 nM, offering an approach for detection of microRNA based on graphene quantum dots ).

These results provide a notion to help develop carbon quantum dot-containing hybrid semiconductors for resolving toxic issues during the water splitting process. In addition to bioimaging and biosensor applications, carbon quantum dots have been investigated for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and also for photodynamic therapy applications. In view of the increasing biomedical and clinical applications of carbon quantum dots, a better understanding of their safety when exposed to blood stream is the need of the hour. Determination of hemolytic properties is one of the fundamental tests in studies of nanoparticles' interaction with blood components and cardiovascular system. Hemolysis may occur when the red blood cell membrane is ruptured and releases hemoglobin into blood plasma which may lead to anemia, hypertension, and renal toxicity. It is therefore imperative to study the hemotoxicity of all nanoparticles that would be administered intravenously. Recently, a special chemical cleavage of layered N-doped carbon materials, carbon nitride quantum dots, was proposed (Cao et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2013b) .",

These protocols have disadvantages namely involvement of sophisticated instruments, strong acids for selfpassivation and tedious procedures. Recently, synthesis of self-passivated fluorescent carbon quantum dots by hydrothermal carbonization of materials has been reported in a single step using various biomass namely deploying ascorbic acid, gelatin, citric acid, egg albumin, bovine serum albumin, orange juice, honey, chitosan, cow milk, soy milk, banana, coffee seeds, watermelon peels, pomelo peel, grass, cellulose, starch, food caramels, and paper ash as carbon source (Cao et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2013b ). These carbon quantum dots display characteristic fluorescence depending upon the functionalities present on the surface. Moreover, hydrothermal carbonization is a greener approach with the use of renewable biomass as a carbon source and at low reaction temperatures; both carbonization and functionalization can be achievable in a single step (Cao et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2013b ).",

Carbon dot-based fluorescence turn-on sensors were instructed for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) monitoring in aqueous solutions through a photo-induced electron transfer mechanism where the sensor showed good selectivity, and sensitivity with a detection limit of 84 nM . In another study, N, S-co-doped fluorescent carbon nano-dots have been synthesized by applying thermal treatment of ammonium persulfate, ethylenediamine and glucose. They displayed bright blue emission with a remarkable fluorescent quantum yield of 21.6%, approved water solubility, uniform morphology, and significant chemical stability as compared to pure carbon dots. The fluorescence of the produced carbon nano-dots could be remarkably quenched by methotrexate through fluorescence resonance energy transfer between carbon nano-dots and methotrexate, and has been applied for highly selective and sensitive identification of methotrexate (more than 50.0 \u03bcM) with a low detection limit of 0.33 nM; it can be useful for hands-on finding of methotrexate in human serum (Wang et al. 2015b ). Amino-functionalized fluorescent carbon dots have also been prepared by hydrothermal treatment of glucosamine and the ensued carbon dots exhibited stabilized green emission fluorescence at various excitation wavelengths and pH environments; they can be used to produce biosensors and for selective detection of hyaluronidase (Liu et al. 2015b ).",

Carbon dots passivated with PPEI-EI for two-photon luminescence microscopy were used to image human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Cao et al. 2007 ); carbon dots showed bright photoluminescence both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm after 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C wherein the cellular uptake of carbon dots was temperature-dependent with no internationalization observed at 4 \u00b0C.

These findings inspired researchers to substitute presently applied antiviral agents (such as ribavirin and interferons), recognized to have major side effects, including short-term memory loss, deficits in decision-making functions, confusion, and extrapyramidal influences.

The carbon dot adsorption could destruct the bacterial cell surface, as these carbon dots changed the charge balance of the bacterial surface and were inserted into the bacterial surface through the long alkyl chains leading to the bacterial inactivation.

This selective fluorosensor showed high sensitivity toward Hg 2+ with a detection limit of 8.6 nM and was practically used for the effective detection of Hg 2+ in riverwater samples ).

Drug delivery systems based on arginine-glycine-aspartic acidconjugated graphene quantum dots were applied in load of doxorubicin (an antitumor drug) for targeted imaging and drug delivery. Indeed the characteristic stable fluorescence of graphene quantum dots permitted the real-time analyses of the cellular uptake from the produced nanoassembly and the following doxorubicin drug release. The doxorubicin releasement showed significant pH dependence and implied hydrogen-bonding interaction between graphene quantum dots and doxorubicin; the graphene quantum dots can be served as pH-sensitive drug carriers (Dong et al. 2018 ). Compared to free doxorubicin, the prepared conjugates revealed remarkable cytotoxicity effects to U251 glioma cells within diverse range of doxorubicin concentrations. Findings form the cellular uptake of these conjugates demonstrated that doxorubicin and some graphene quantum dots have entered into cell nuclei after incubation (~ 16 h). These combinational enhancements with suitable nuclear delivery enhanced the doxorubicin cytotoxicity effects, noticeably (Dong et al. 2018) . Additionally, the prepared folic acid-conjugated graphene quantum dots could be applied for loading of doxorubicin, real-time evaluating of cellular uptake and the consequent drug release. This prepared nanoassembly was precisely internalized promptly by HeLa cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas doxorubicin release and accumulations were sustained.

Considerable important variations exist with significant results on the carbon-based sensors functions and their related biocompatibility. Because, the fluorescence characteristics and quantum yields are associated with the inclusive composition and the existence of remaining chemical groups on the carbon and graphene quantum dots surfaces, this standardization is significantly essential. Optimized synthetic strategies are crucial for scaling up the processes, and in this context, applying simple, greener, environmentally friendly and cost-effective techniques are very critical. Using synthetic approaches that rely on renewable starting materials is remarkably interesting and requires investigations for commercial and scale-up production. On the other hand, applying synthetic methods at lower temperatures (low-energy input) using earth-abundant starting ingredients is still an important challenge for researchers in the field. Photoluminescence is one of the extremely attractive characteristics of carbon and graphene quantum dots, but these properties are highly dependent on the raw materials deployed in fabrication and the presence of surface functionalities on these particles which are noticeable in the case of carbon quantum dots from organic molecules and biomass. Most importantly, one of the lingering challenges has been to improve and develop the quantum yield of carbon quantum dots while taking full advantage of their intrinsic characteristics and to fine-tune their emission spectrum; the improvement in carbon quantum dots with strong fluorescence emission is crucial for biomedical imaging without harmful effects (Liu et al. 2017b; Wang et al. 2016b; Murugan et al. 2019; Halder et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; de Menezes et al. 2019; Barras et al. 2016; Nekoueian et al. 2019; Li et al. 2015; Mei et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2014) .",
