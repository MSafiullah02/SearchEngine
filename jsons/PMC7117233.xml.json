For these reasons, this factor was named cytotoxic necrotising factor or CNF (Caprioli et al., 1983) and CNF-producing E. coli were later called necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC) (Gonzales and Blanco, 1989). Two different types of CNF have actually been reported (De Rycke et al., 1987, De Rycke et al., 1990a): type-1 is similar to the one described by Caprioli et al. (1983), with formation of rounded multinucleated cells, whereas type-2, identical to the Vir toxin (Smith, 1974) causes the formation of elongated multinucleated cells. However, CNF1 and CNF2 are closely related antigenically and genetically (De Rycke et al., 1987, Oswald et al., 1994a). The cnf2 gene is located on the Vir plasmid (Smith, 1974, Oswald et al., 1994a), whereas the cnf1 gene is located on the chromosome (Falbo et al., 1992).",

In vitro, data originate from studies on cell cultures. Although purified CNF toxins cause the formation of multinucleated cells, the effect of the interaction between NTEC2 strains and HeLa cells is characterised by the production of giant mononucleated cells with the appearance of actin stress fibres and a block in the G2/M phase of the division (De Rycke et al., 1996). The actin cytoskeleton reorganisation with the appearance of stress fibres is mediated by the CNF2 toxin, which causes hyperactivation of a small GTP binding Rho protein (Oswald et al., 1994a). The cell cycle block in the G2/M phase is caused by a more recently described toxin, the cytolethal distending toxin type-3 (CDTIII toxin), which prevents the activation of the cdc2 protein kinase (Comayras et al., 1997, Peres et al., 1997).",

NTEC1 strains have been isolated from cases of enteritis in ruminants, pigs, dogs, rabbits and horses, from septicaemia in pigs, from urinary tract infections, and from other extra-intestinal infections in dogs, cats and humans. De Rycke and Plassiart (1990b) investigated the effect in young lambs of intravenous injection of a partially purified preparation of CNF1. All the lambs developed severe clinical signs starting 6 h after inoculation, which consisted mainly in neurological signs and mucoid diarrhoea. Orally-inoculated NTEC1 strains also cause enterocolitis and bacterial colonisation of the lungs in piglets (Wray et al., 1993; Clement et al., results not published).",

NTEC2 may thus, represent opportunistic pathogens waiting for favourable circumstances (like newborn), a consideration which in no way diminishes their virulence potential once the circumstances are present. Similar observations were made recently in piglets with NTEC1 (Clement et al., results not published).",

Precise interaction between NTEC2 and mutants strains and the intestinal epithelium may also be investigated in more details using intestinal explants (Baehler and Moxley, 2000).",
