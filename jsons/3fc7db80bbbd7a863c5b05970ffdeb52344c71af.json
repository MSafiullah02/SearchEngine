She did not have a family history of hereditary 35 angioedema, and she was not on any medication. In March 2020, she presented with 36 symptoms of odynophagia and dry cough, with rapid onset of fever. The day after the 37 symptoms appeared, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper-airway secretions (by 38 nasopharyngeal swab) was performed, revealing Severe acute respiratory syndrome 39 coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. With this positive result, she was instructed to remain in 40 strict home isolation. She evolved satisfactorily, with 4 days of fever and dry cough, followed 41 by 5 days of total anosmia and ageusia from which she completely recovered. On day +11 of 42 disease evolution, after resolution of the previous symptoms, rapidly spreading wheals 43 developed in various locations on her body: face, trunk, abdomen and limbs. In few hours, face 44 wheals promptly converted to facial angioedema (figure 1), with preferential involvement of 45 periocular region and mild edema of the lips, without compromise of the tongue, uvula, vocal 46 cords, or the airway. No other symptoms were noted. The appearance of the lesions was not 47 related to food intake (she had not eaten nuts). She had not taken non-steroidal inflammatory 48 drugs (NSAIDs) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors the previous fifteen days. 49",

This recently 66 published work was carried out in a hospital of Lombardy region, in Italy, and studied 88 67 patients affected of coronavirus infection who had not taken any new drug in the previous 15 68 days. Out of these 88 patients, 18 patients (20.4%) developed cutaneous manifestations. These 69 were erythematous rash (14 patients, 16%), widespread urticaria (3 patients, 3,4%) and 70 chickenpox-like vesicles (1 patient, 1,1%) (4) . Unfortunately, no pictures were performed 71 because of the high-risk to infect other patients with the use of a photographic device. 72 We report a new case of acute urticaria in the setting of Covid-19, including both wheals and 73 angioedema and provide, for the first time, clinical images of skin manifestations of covid-19. 74 permeability; some authors have proposed a cross reaction between viral IgM and IgG with 84 mast cell IgE favoring mast cell degranulation (6) , while other groups defend that circulating 85 immune complexes stimulate the production of vasoactive amines by basophils and activate 86 complement (7) . Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of coronavirus) is 87 primarily attacked by immune cells, including mast cells, which are located in the submucosa 88 of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity, and represent a barrier of protection against 89 microorganisms. Viral activated mast cells release inflammatory chemical compounds 90 including protease, interleukins (IL) as such as IL-1, IL-6 or IL-33, and histamine (8) . This 91 histamine release may lead to urticaria and angioedema, as occurred in this case. However, 92 the exact role of this infection in the development of urticaria is not clear and will need further 93 studies. 94",
