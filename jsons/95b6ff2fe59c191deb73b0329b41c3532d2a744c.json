The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed infection and death from France as well as their initial spatial distribution. First, the system of partial differential equations is studied, then the basic reproduction number, R 0 is derived. Second, numerical simulations, based on a combination of level-set and finite differences, shown the spatial spread of COVID-19 from March 16 to June 16. Finally, scenarios of unlockdown are compared according to variation of distancing, or partially spatial lockdown.",

COVID-19 belongs to the Coronaviridae family. A family of coronaviruses that cause diseases in humans and animals, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases. Although only seven coronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans, three of these, COVID-19 included, can cause severe infection, and sometimes fatal to humans.",

We focus our study on six components of the epidemic flow (Figure 1 ), i.e. the densities of Susceptible individual (S), Exposed individual (E), symptomatic Infected individual (I s ), asymptomatic Infected individual (I a ), Under treatment individual (U ) and Removed individual (R). To simplify the readings, treatments are not distinguished between quarantine, hospitalization or medicine. To build the mathematical model, we followed the standard strategy developed in the literature concerning SIR model (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Brauer and Castillo-Chavez, 2012; Arcede et al., 2020) . We assumed that susceptible can be infected by exposed and by infected individuals. We suppose that only susceptible, exposed and asymptotic individuals are moving.
