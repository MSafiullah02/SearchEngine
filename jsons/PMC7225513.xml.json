            "text": "Perceiving information and extracting business insights and knowledge from data is one of the major challenges in smart manufacturing [1]. In this sense, advanced data analytics is a crucial enabler of Industry 4.0 [2]. More specifically, among the major challenges for smart manufacturing are: (deep) machine learning, prescriptive analytics in industrial plants, and analytics-based decision support in manufacturing operations [3]. The wide adoption of IoT devices, sensors and actuators in manufacturing environments has fostered an increasing research interest on real-time data analytics. However, these approaches face several challenges in real-life scenarios: (i) They require a large amount of sensor data that already have experienced events (e.g. failures of -ideally- all possible causes); (ii) They require an enormous computational capacity that cannot be supported by existing computational infrastructure of factories; (iii) In most cases, the sensor data involve only a few components of a production line, or a small number of parameters related to each component (e.g. temperature, pressure, vibration), making impossible to capture the whole picture of the factory shop floor and the possible correlations among all the machines; (iv) The cold-start problem is rarely investigated. On the other hand, there is a huge treasure of legacy, enterprise and operational systems data remaining untouched. Manufacturers are sitting on a goldmine of unexplored historical, legacy and operational data from their Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP), etc. and they cannot afford to miss out on its unexplored potential. However, only 20\u201330% of the value from such available data-at-rest is currently accrued [4].",

Therefore, legacy data analytics have the credentials to move beyond KPIs calculations of business reports (e.g. OEE, uptime, etc.), towards providing an all-around view of manufacturing operations on the shopfloor in a proactive manner. In this direction, the recent advancements of machine learning can have a substantial contribution in performing predictive and prescriptive analytics on the basis of enterprise and operational data aiming at supporting the operator on the shopfloor and at extracting meaningful insights. Combining predictive and prescriptive analytics is essential for smarter decisions in manufacturing [2]. In addition mobile computing (with the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets) can significantly enable timely, comfortable, non-intrusive and reliable interaction with the operator on the shopfloor [6], e.g. for generating alerts, guiding their work, etc. through dedicated mobile apps.",

It is supported today by many software tools and data warehouses, and it is known by the name \u201cdescriptive analytics\u201d. A step further, however, is to use the same data to feed models that can make predictions with similar or better accuracy than a human expert. In the framework of smart manufacturing, prognostics related to machines\u2019 health status is a critical research domain that often leverages machine learning methods and data mining tools. In most of the cases, this is related to the analysis of streaming sensor data mainly for health monitoring [7\u20139], but also for failure prediction [10\u201312] as part of a predictive maintenance strategy. However, in all of these approaches, the prediction is produced only minutes or even seconds before the actual failure, which, is not often a realistic and practical solution for a real industrial case. The factory managers need to have this information hours or days before the event, so that there is enough time for them to act proactively and prevent it. One way to achieve this is to perform data mining on maintenance and operational data that capture the daily life-cycle of the shop floor in order to make more high-level predictions [13\u201315].",

RL shows an increasing trend in research literature as a tool for optimal policies in manufacturing problems (e.g. [20, 21]). In RL, the problem is represented by an environment consisting of states and actions and learning agents with a defined goal state. The agents aim to reach the goal state while maximizing the rewards by selecting actions and moving to different states. In Interactive RL, there is the additional capability of incorporating evaluative feedback by a human observer so that the RL agent learns from both human feedback and environmental reward [22]. Another extension is Multi-Objective RL (MORL), which is a sequential decision making problem with multiple objectives. MORL requires a learning agent to obtain action policies that can optimize multiple objectives at the same time [23].",

As in most neural network algorithms, LSTM networks are able to seamlessly model non-linear problems with multiple input variables through the iterative training of their parameters (weights). Since the predictive analytics model deals with time-series, the LSTM model is trained using supervised learning on a set of training sequences assigned to a known output value. Therefore, an analyst feeds the model with a set of daily features for a given machine (e.g. the factors that produce the OEE) and use as outcome the number of days until the next failure. This number is known since historical data can hold this information. Nevertheless, when the model is finally built and put in operation, it will use new input data and will have to estimate the new outcome.",

To do this, it implements the policy shaping algorithm [25], a Bayesian approach that attempts to maximize the information gained from human feedback by utilizing it as direct labels on the policy.

In the milling station, there is one pair of back up rolls and one pair of work rolls. The deformation takes place through force of the rolls supported by adjustable strip tension in both coilers and de-coilers. Over the life of the roll some wear will occur due to normal processing, and some wear will occur due to extraneous conditions.

A multivariate time series model was designed, as several input features were used in order to predict one output feature. To this direction, the first time series analysis performed in order to predict when the next interruption will occur (\u2018When do we expect the next interruption?\u2019). A new feature named \u2018Days from next breakdown event\u2019 was created, and the model was trained. The input features selected for this prediction were: Availability, Performance, Minutes of Breakdown, Minutes of Interruptions, Real Gross Production and the date. After preprocessing the data, the appropriate sequences were extracted that would allow for several timesteps to be selected and tested for the analysis. In our case, timestep represented the last \u201cn\u201d days that the model will use. The LSTM model was then created by testing several layers, optimizers, neurons, batch sizes and epochs until the best performing model was designed. The final result ended being a sequential model with a first LSTM layer of 32 neurons, a second LSTM layer of 16 neurons, a dropout layer with rate 0.1, and finally a dense layer. The model was then trained using data from 2017, 2018 and six months of 2019; with an rmsprop optimizer, a batch size of 1, a timestep of 1, an epochs value of 300, and an early stopping that reached the best performance around 100 epochs. Predictions deal with the last six months of 2019, and the result can be seen in Fig. 4. The blue line represents the actual values and the orange line represents the predicted values.

The generated policies are then integrated into a single policy taking into account the consistency (C = 0.7) and likelihood (L = 0.8) values.

The potential of the proposed approach is high, especially in traditional industries that have not benefit from the advancements of Industry 4.0 and that have just started investigating the potential of data analytics and machine learning for the optimization of their production processes. The traditional manufacturing sectors (e.g. textile, furniture, packaging, steel processing) have usually older factories with limited capacity on investing in modern production technologies. Since the neural networks are inherently adaptive, the proposed approach could be applied to similar production lines (e.g. at a newly established factory of the same type) overcoming the cold-start problem, due to which other techniques usually fail. It also exploits both the \u201cvoice of data\u201d and the \u201cvoice of experts\u201d. Regarding future work, we plan to evaluate our proposed approach in additional use cases, with different requirements, as well as to investigate approaches and algorithms for fusion of the outcomes derived from real-time data analytics and operational data analytics that represent different levels of information.",
