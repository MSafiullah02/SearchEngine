Using countrylevel data, we modeled the early growth in the number of cases for over 480 cities in all Brazilian states. As the main findings, we found that the percentage of people respecting social distancing protocols was the main explanatory factor for the observed growth rate of COVID-19. Those cities that presented the highest spread of the new coronavirus were also those that had lower averages of social distancing. We also underline that total population of cities and connectivity, represented by the city-level importance to the air transportation of people across the country, plays important roles in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Climate and socioeconomic predictors had little contribution to the big-picture scenario. Our results show that different States had high variability in their growth rates, mostly due to quite different public health strategies to retain the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of all limitations of such a large-scale approach, our results underline that climatic conditions are likely weak limiting factors for the spread of the new coronavirus, and the circulation of people in the city-and country-level are the most responsible factors for the early outbreak of COVID-19 in",

This sequential sub-modelling approach intended to assess whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak across Brazil was related to each one of our predictors along the early spread of the disease, considering cities at different stages of the dissemination wave. All predictors were checked and only total population required log transformation to approximate a normal distribution. Before statistical analyses, we checked the multicollinearity of predictors, by computing the variance inflation factors (VIF), and removed those that the variance of a regression coefficient was inflated in the presence of other explanatory variables (i.e. VIF > 5; (Borcard et al., 2018) ). In this case, HDI and average income showed collinearity, so we kept the later in our analyses because of its larger variation. In addition, we used Moran's I correlograms (Legendre and Legendre, 2012) to check if the control for spatial autocorrelation bias was required, which could somehow inflate the significance of each predictor. A summary of all the predictors used to fit the regression models is provided in Fig 2. Finally, we fitted independent linear models to each State to investigate potential regional trends in the COVID-19 growth, using the most important predictors identified in the previous steps, separately. For this procedure, we used only those states that had at least five cities with at least five confirmed cases. For inference, we then plotted the log-transformed total number of confirmed cases against the standardized slopes of the models, which portrays the state-dependent context of growth in COVID-19 cases.

These outcomes underline that the direct and indirect contact among individuals was the most responsible for the rapid spread of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Brazil. Contrary to initial perspectives, the ability of COVID-19 to spread, estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) statistic, seems to be higher than the WHO estimated . Moreover, substantial transmission before symptom onset facilitates the rapid dissemination of the novel coronavirus (Hellewell et al., 2020) . As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing certainly reduce transmission rates (Anderson et al., 2020) . For this reason, keeping people apart from each other, whenever feasible, should be the primary goal of public health programs to prevent human-to-human transmission. We found evidences that the tools adopted by states and municipalities, including the closure of schools and commercial buildings, lock down of restaurants and malls, and prohibitions of mass gatherings had a negative impact on the expansion of COVID-19 in Brazil. Most importantly, this result somehow evidences that the combination of ignoring social distance especially in large and well connected cities will have catastrophic consequences.",

However, the example of the sanitary action conducted in Great China was fundamental when the contagious boundaries were discrete. In Brazil's context, there are cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other capitals such as Fortaleza and Manaus that likely act as superspreaders of SARS-CoV-2. In a network context, these cities maximize their influence on COVID-19 spread by exporting many cases to cities nearby (Madotto and Liu, 2016) . This fact highlights that these centers should be of foremost concern, especially because some of them are near (e.g. Cear\u00e1 and Rio de Janeiro) or have already saturated (e.g., Manaus) their health system carrying capacity, given that the number of cases is growing very fast (Crokidakis, 2020) . Therefore, the multiple potential Wuhan-alike regions in Brazil require government-level actions towards the necessity of multiplicative movement restrictions and social distancing. Moreover, there are speculations that the number of documented Brazilian cases is likely more than ten times lower than the real number (Bastos and Cajueiro, 2020) , considering that tests are being conducted mostly only in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Although the coefficients were quite weak, this suggests that high temperatures and precipitation are not limiting factors for the spread of the virus. Conversely, a scenario of extreme concern is emerging, since the Winter season approaches, so temperatures will drop dramatically across many areas, especially in the South region.

While evacuating cities is not reasonable at this point, the easiest and the most feasible way to decelerate the COVID-19 spread is to avoid people transportation among them. This is fundamental within cities. While the virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is remarkably high and we are not able to tear houses or buildings apart, the only way to allow for the healthcare systems to treat ill people effectively is performing social distancing. In the absence of any effective treatment and vaccine, we support that social distancing is still the only feasible way to avoid the collapse of our national health system. Specially in Brazil, a '3rd world country', we have few hospitals and clinics with beds and respirators that are autonomous for treating SARS, which means that if we allow it to grow fast by not maintaining restrictions in movement between cities/states and social distancing within cities, we may certainly hope for the best but expect for the worst. We assume that the indicator for the efficiency of social distancing is a conundrum because the response about its effectiveness might come only weeks after the execution of any plans. In fact, people tend to underrate social isolation because the more effective it is, the less needed it seems to be. We also admit that any delayed action can be catastrophic, both for the health and economy of any country.",

Moreover, total population and social distancing shared similar slices of explained variance (i.e., similar color in Figures 4a,c), such as in Amazonas (AM) and Maranh\u00e3o (MA). Where the number of cases were the highest in Brazil, such as S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Cear\u00e1 (CE), and Pernambuco (PE), both population size and social distancing shared nearly similar contributions for their observed condition of the spread of COVID-19. Particularly, the situation of Pernambuco (PE) can be considered as the fairest tradeoff between population size and distance of citizens (i.e., similar circle colors). By contrast, those states where the social distancing and the effect of total population were combined to produce the mildest scenarios of COVID-19 spread were Esp\u00edrito Santo (ES), Goi\u00e1s (GO), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Paran\u00e1 (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC), compared to other federal units.",
