These four regions are organized as follows (Fig. 1B): (i) a flexible N terminus forming the major part of contacts with nsp10 (cyan), followed by (ii) the exonuclease domain (orange), (iii) a flexible hinge region formed by a loop and three strands (gray) (Fig. 1C), and (iv) a C terminus N7-MTase domain (pink). The surface defined by the C terminus end of the ExoN domain (i.e., hinge, N7-MTase domain) is reminiscent of a saddle, which may accommodate a protein partner (discussed below). The nsp14 structure compared with the one published (31) presents insightful modifications. Despite identical topology compared with the other available structure, nsp14 presents a high level of flexibility. Hence, overall nsp14 chain-to-chain superimposition presents significant root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) drifting from 1.13 to 4.10 \u00c5. Moreover, we also observe significant mobility between the two domains of nsp14 (discussed in The Hinge Region Allows Large Movements Between the ExoN and N7-MTase Domains), while the structure of nsp10 remains essentially unchanged with rmsds ranging from 0.68 to 0.95 \u00c5, relative to published structures of nsp10 alone (32, 33) or in complex with nsp14 (31) or nsp16 (34, 35).",

Despite a pronounced twist of the central sheet, the fold is reminiscent of that of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily (36) (Fig. 2B). A Protein Data Bank fold search on the SARS-CoV ExoN domain retrieves the structures of the human 3\u2032-5\u2032 ExoN (37) and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ribonuclease T (38), both with an rmsd of 1.2 \u00c5.

Here, the N terminus of nsp10 is stabilized by the first 25 residues of nsp14, forming a clamp that accommodates the first 10 residues of nsp10. The interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is figuratively similar to a hand (nsp14) over fist (nsp10). Fingers are formed by the whole flexible N terminus region of nsp14 (residues 1\u201350), \u03b21 (residues 51\u201355), and an antiparallel \u03b2-strand budding out from the ExoN domain (residues 122\u2013138), while the palm is constituted by top and side (residues 55\u201369 and 195\u2013202) of the ExoN domain (Fig. 1).

Indeed, the nsp10/nsp14 interaction surface is of 7,798 \u00c52 versus 3,225 \u00c52 for nsp10/nsp16.",

In the presence of nsp10, residues of the ExoN active site are correctly positioned and form a highly active ExoN, as judged by the observed distance between catalytic residues. In the absence of nsp10, using SAXS (SI Text and Fig. S2), we observed large conformational changes in the N terminus of nsp14, which impact the overall shape of the exonuclease fold (Fig. S3). Without the fist (nsp10), the fingers of the hand fold onto the palm; by doing so, they distort the cavity containing the ExoN catalytic residues. This cavity is located in the back of the palm, by moving up the \u03b1-helix (residues 147\u2013159) forming the top of the RNA-binding path, with distant residues (residues 110\u2013117) repositioning the \u03b2-sheet. This distortion indicates that the ExoN catalytic pocket partially collapses in the absence of nsp10, accounting for the weak ExoN activity of nsp14 alone (30).",

The hinge, which can be seen as an extension of the N7-MTase domain, is composed of a flexible interdomain loop (residues F286\u2013G300) (Fig. 1C) wrapping around a three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b218, \u03b217, and \u03b216, including residues L406\u2013A430) jutting out of the N7-MTase domain (Fig. 3 A and B). Sequence analyses show that amino acids forming the flexible hinge are conserved across Coronavirinae, suggesting that they play a critical and functional role in regulation of the nsp14 hinge region movement. Indeed, this particular structure allows lateral and rotational movements of the C-terminal domain with respect to the N-terminal domain, such that an \u223c13 \u00c5 deviation is observed from one peptide chain to the other (crystallography and SAXS analysis in Fig. S3).",

The fold presents a central five-stranded \u03b2-sheet made up of four parallel strands (\u03b212, \u03b211, \u03b214, and \u03b215) and one antiparallel strand (\u03b222). The central \u03b2-sheet is sandwiched between a single \u03b1-helix (\u03b17) and three long loops punctuated by two small helices (\u03b18 and \u03b73). The central sheet is surrounded by two strands (\u03b213 and \u03b219), which are perpendicular but not fully aligned with the central sheet. Between \u03b215 and the second turn, \u03b73 is inserted into the \u03b2-sheet of the hinge (discussed above), which forms a lid above the active site. Following the turn is a long flexible extension drifting almost away from the \u03b2-sheet, which ends with a \u03b2-strand (\u03b220) involved in a parallel \u03b2-sheet with another strand (\u03b221). A long, disordered region (residues 453\u2013465) not built in our structural model separates the two strands, and we postulate that it may serve as a binding platform for other partners (39). The strand is followed by a long helix (\u03b19). Between the tip of strand \u03b221 and the bottom of helix \u03b19, a third zinc-binding site is found. It is formed by residues Cys452, Cys477, Cys484, and His487. This zinc finger constrains the structure locally and orients \u03b19 toward the center of the structure, making \u03b19 and \u03b17 cross each other and positioning the C terminus of the helix just above the \u03b2-sheet, allowing strand \u03b222 to complete the central \u03b2-sheet. The C terminus of nsp14 ends with a helix (\u03b110) which is at almost 90\u00b0 from strand \u03b222 and, together with \u03b19, sandwiches the parallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b220\u2013\u03b221). The molecular mechanism of the RNA cap guanine N7-methylation has been described previously (31, 40).",

The Rossmann fold, defined as a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 structure, is one of the five most common structural motifs widely distributed and considered as remnants of most ancient protein architectures (42) (Fig. 3C). Briefly, the Rossmann fold can be described as a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet with at least three parallel \u03b1-helices on each side (\u03b1/\u03b2 fold). Some variations of the fold have been observed among structures of dinucleotide-binding domains: Variations include the number of \u03b2-strands in the complete \u03b2-sheet that forms the Rossmann fold, as well as the length and number of secondary structures of the segment that connects the second and third \u03b2-strands (43). Two landmarks of the Rossmann fold family are the first structural feature, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2, and the motif sequence G-x-G-(x)n-G, which both constitute the NTP-binding site. It is the conservation of the canonical \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold motif in these enzymes that ascertains a common evolutionary origin of these proteins.",

However, the structural basis of the interaction of nsp14 with nsp12-RdRp is still unresolved. Based on our nsp14 structure, we defined three nsp14 domains and showed that not only the ExoN domain but also the N7-MTase domain of nsp14 interacts with nsp12-RdRp and that the first 71 amino acids of nsp14 are not essential for interaction with the polymerase (Fig. S4).",

Based on both the amino acids exposed to the surface of the saddle and sequence conservation across Coronavirinae, 14 mutants in the nsp14 N7-MTase domain were generated (Y296A, P297A, N306A, R310A, V466K, L468K, K469A, C473A, T475A, L479A, H487A, L495A, Y498A, and N499A). As a control, the nsp14-ExoN catalytic site mutant (D90A/E92A) was also included in the study. The propensity of these nsp14 mutants to interact with nsp12-RdRp and their respective ExoN and N7-MTase activities were determined as previously described (18, 30, 44). As shown in Table S2, three nsp14 substitutions (R310A, H487A, and L495A) significantly alter N7-MTase activity (1% \u00b1 0.1, 14% \u00b1 2.5, and 26% \u00b1 0.7, respectively). The critical role of the R310 residue in cap methylation has already been demonstrated as an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding residue (40). Interestingly, seven residues in the nsp14 N7-MTase domain (Y296, P297, C473, T475, H487, L495, and Y498) are essential for ExoN activity (Fig. S5). These mutants are correctly folded since they retain either interaction with nsp12-RdRp (Fig. S6) or N7-MTase activity (Table S2) (except nsp14 H487A, which is altered for all three properties tested, as discussed below). Finally, two nsp14 residues (H487 and Y498) are critical for the interaction with nsp12-RdRp in vitro (Fig. S6). His487 is located in zinc finger 3 of the N7-MTase domain (Fig. S5). Whereas the nsp14 Y498A mutant conserves an N7-MTase activity in the same range as nsp14 wt (95% \u00b1 6), the nsp14 H487A mutant exhibits a substantially reduced N7-MTase activity (14% \u00b1 2.5). The nsp14 H487 residue may be involved in charge-mediated protein/protein interactions since the nsp14 H487R mutant fully conserved N7-MTase activity (31), consistent with the nsp14/nsp12 interaction site proposed here.",

For this purpose, we used a primer/template bearing an A:A mismatch (Fig. 5A), which is both poorly generated (Fig. S7) and poorly extended by the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Fig. 5B, lane b). We asked if the RNA polymerase may be able to resume polymerization starting from this primer/template, after proofreading by the 3\u2032-5\u2032 ExoN. After addition of nsp10 and nsp14, an extension product is readily detected (Fig. 5B, lanes e and f). We sequenced the resulting RNA products after conversion to cDNA by RT-PCR, using a specific and selective RT primer (Materials and Methods). With the polymerase complex alone, 100% of the clones (eight of eight) carry the initial A base. The presence of nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN promotes A-to-U repair of \u223c90% of sequenced clones (43 of 49 clones) (Fig. 5C), whereas that of nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN(\u2212) leaves \u223c94% of sequenced clones (33 of 35 clones) unrepaired (P < 0.001). In line with reverse genetics findings (28), these results provide a molecular basis for RNA synthesis proofreading by the SARS-CoV replicase.",

Is the nsp12-RdRp permissive to nucleotide analog incorporation into RNA? If yes, could the analog be excised by the associated ExoN activity? We first examined if Rbv-TP could serve as a nucleotide substrate of the SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Fig. 6A). Rbv 5\u2032-monophosphate (Rbv) is incorporated into RNA, preferentially opposite template pyrimidines (UMP or CMP) (Fig. 6A), around 100-fold less efficiently than a regular Watson\u2013Crick base pair (Fig. 6B). To determine if ExoN activity could excise Rbv from the 3\u2032-end of a primer, we used a synthetic RNA primer exhibiting an Rbv monophosphate at its 3\u2032 end (named LS2-Rbv) annealed to the RNA template LS15, resulting in Rbv opposite CMP (Table S3). This RNA substrate was first tested with a high concentration of nsp14 alone: A rapid disappearance of the Rbv-terminated primer is observed over time (Fig. 6C), confirming that an intact ribose, rather than the base, is a strong determinant of nsp14 substrate selectivity (30). The addition of increasing concentrations of nsp10 stimulates the excision rate of the terminal Rbv (Fig. 6C). The rate of nsp10/nsp14-mediated Rbv excision is about fourfold faster than that of an A:A mismatch (Fig. 6D), which are data that can be extended to any erroneous nucleotide incorporation. Indeed, it was shown that single mismatches of any type are removed by the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity with a similar efficacy (30).",

We demonstrate here, at the molecular level, that CoVs have indeed acquired an enzyme able to enhance the overall fidelity, and that this event might have directly promoted the jump in size of CoV genomes.

The SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14 structure was previously described as reminiscent (31) or deviant (48) of the Rossmann fold. However, based on our analysis, SARS-CoV nsp14 does not present the signature of a Rossmann fold: It lacks the defining motif \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 (Fig. 3) and presents the structural constraint of a zinc-binding site stacking a long helix (\u03b19) structuring the \u03b2-sheet. Moreover, a sequence analysis of SARS-CoV N7-MTase with a distant homology search only retrieves CoV sequences. Altogether, these findings indicate that the nsp14 N7-MTase domain has appeared during evolution independent from Rossmann fold MTases. It would seem logical that the nsp14 N7-MTases had appeared before Rossmann fold MTases, because the latter had successfully evolved to N7-methylate mRNA caps of all species that use the RNA cap to initiate their mRNA translations.",

When binding to the amino terminus of nsp14, nsp10 allows the exonuclease active site to adopt a stably closed conformation, allowing efficient hydrolysis of dsRNA. Conversely, in the absence of nsp10, large conformational changes in the N terminus of nsp14 occur, as shown by SAXS, leading to a weak ExoN activity (30). The potent nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity may be involved in the degradation of immune stimulatory dsRNA, as was shown in vivo for the nsp14 of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a prototypic Alphacoronavirus (49). In contrast, the much lower ExoN activity of nsp14 on its own may be associated with a proofreading mechanism.",

These large movements may allow different functions and interactions with protein partners. The latter property is reminiscent of intrinsically disordered proteins, which have evolved binding platforms to perform sequential activities. Furthermore, the hinge may act as a molecular switch. Indeed, nsp14 is directly involved in at least two processes that use two different kinds of RNA substrates. During replication, newly synthesized dsRNA with a mismatch should be translocated from the RNA polymerase to the ExoN catalytic cavity of nsp14. During transcription, a nascent 5\u2032-cap mRNA should go into the N7-MTase catalytic tunnel of nsp14 (Fig. 7). It was shown previously that the ExoN domain is closely involved in the activity of the N7-MTase (40). In the present study, we establish the reciprocity with the nsp14 N7-MTase domain that is essential for the ExoN activity. These results could be explained by alteration of the nsp14 flexibility. In fact, two conserved residues (Y296 and P297) located in the hinge of nsp14 and involved in the flexibility are essential for the ExoN activity. Altogether, these structural data combining structure and flexibility strengthen the unique feature of CoV nsp14.",

            "text": "In summary, we have reconstituted a functional pathway demonstrating that misincorporated nucleotides can be excised from the nascent viral genome. The conservation of nsp10, nsp12, and nsp14 across the CoV genus suggests that our finding may well apply to many members of the Coronaviridae family. Hence, a direct consequence of the CoV RNA proofreading system is its potential impact on antiviral strategies using nucleoside analogs, as illustrated by the excision of Rbv. Interestingly, the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN activity is inactive on dsRNA substrates bearing 3\u2032-end ribose modifications (30). These results make the design of nonexcisable chain terminators a rational strategy for anti-CoV. Accordingly, Gilead\u2019s GS-5734 1\u2032-cyano\u2013substituted nucleoside ribose analog was reported active against, at least, the MERS-CoV with an EC50 value of 0.34 \u03bcM (50). Very recently, the GS-5734 spectrum of action was extended to SARS-CoV, bat CoVs, and circulating human CoVs, making this nucleotide prodrug an effective pan-CoV inhibitor candidate (51). It will be interesting to assess if the ribose 1\u2032-cyanyl group is also a determinant of resistance to ExoN activity.",

Crystals were cryoprotected with a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% PEG 200, prior to being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline Proxima1 at the Soleil synchrotron. The MAD data were collected to 3.5 \u00c5 resolution at the peak (\u03bb = 1.28242 \u00c5) and inflection (\u03bb = 1.28282 \u00c5) wavelengths for zinc. Higher resolution (3.38 \u00c5) data were collected from a single crystal of the native complex (\u03bb = 1.28348 \u00c5). Datasets were processed and analyzed with the autoPROC toolbox (52), and the structure was solved by the MAD method using the anomalous scattering signal of zinc, with autoSHARP (53). Twenty zinc positions from the anomalous difference map helped calculate an initial electron density map and align the sequence identifying the key residues of zinc-binding sites. Auto-building with Buccaneer (54) was useful to extend the model, which was further manually built with Coot (55) and refined with BUSTER (56). The model was further refined with ROSETTA-PHENIX (57) to 3.38 \u00c5, using the higher resolution native dataset. The final model has Rwork = 19.6% and Rfree = 23.4% and was confirmed to have good stereochemistry according to MOLPROBITY (58). Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table S1.
