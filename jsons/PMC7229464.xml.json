To date, there have been five different species of CoV identified which naturally infect pigs (Wang et al., 2019). These include three alphacoronaviruses: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) together with its variant porcine respiratory virus (PRCV) (Pensaert et al., 1986), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) (Pan et al., 2017); one betacoronavirus: porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Greig et al., 1962); and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Woo et al., 2012). TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV and SeACoV cause swine enteric coronavirus disease (SECD), characterized by acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets leading to moderate or high mortality and significant economic losses for the pork industry, in Asia since 2010 (Pan et al., 2012) and North America since 2013 (Huang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2019).",

            "text": "SeACoV was discovered in Guangdong province, China in 2017. Initially, outbreaks of severe diarrhea of suckling piglets occurred in four swine herds in a mountainous area of northern Guangdong (Fig. 1\n). Our laboratory was the first group to isolate and characterize this new virus in Vero cells, and determined its genome to be closely related to the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 in the subgenus Rhinacovirus (Pan et al., 2017). We also demonstrated that SeACoV was able to infect pigs orally (Pan et al., 2017). SeACoV is known by other names, such as porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) (Gong et al., 2017), or swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)-CoV (Zhou et al., 2018b). The latter nomenclature is attractive, likely due to name similarity to SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV of humans) which may make it easier to gain media attention. However, since the actual pathogenicity of this new virus is still controversial based on current evidence (see main text below), the presumed name \u201cSADS\u201d (also easily confused with \u201cSARS\u201d) may not be appropriate in the future in our opinion. Therefore, SeACoV is the name we will use to refer to this new virus in this review.",

SeACoV particles are round with a diameter of 100-120 nm (Fig. 2\nA), and are covered with dimly visible trimers of S protein (Fig. 2A and B). Bat enteric alphacoronavirus HKU2 strains were first reported from Guangdong province and Hong Kong in 2004 and 2006 during the search for the source of SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2007). The prototype SeACoV (CH/GD-01/2017 strain) shares 94.9% nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with the four bat HKU2 strains (Pan et al., 2017). The SeACoV genome is 27,155 nt long with a 5\u02b9 cap and a 3\u02b9 polyadenylated tail, and contains a 5\u02b9 untranslated region (UTR) followed by nine open reading frames (ORFs) and a 3\u02b9 UTR (Fig. 2C). RNA synthesis in SeACoV is carried out by a replicase-transcriptase composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b, which are located in the 5\u02b9 two-thirds of the genome (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b). The 3\u02b9 third harbors ORFs that encode four structural proteins [S; envelope (E); membrane (M); nucleocapsid (N)], an accessory ORF3 between S and E, and two overlapping ORFs (NS7a and NS7b) following the N gene (Yang et al., 2019a; Zhou et al., 2018b) (Fig. 2B and C). These structural and accessory genes are expressed from six subgenomic mRNAs including a bicistronic mRNA containing the accessory NS7a and NS7b genes (Fig. 2D), which have been experimentally confirmed in SeACoV-infected cells (Yang et al., 2019a). The leader-body junction sequences of these subgenomic mRNAs are identical to the leader core sequence AACTAAA (Yang et al., 2019a).",

            "text": "Among the four viral structural proteins, the S glycoprotein of SeACoV is the major protein involved in the viral entry via cellular receptor binding, and it induces host immune responses through the induction of neutralizing antibodies. The SeACoV S protein shares 86.4% amino acid (aa) identity with the bat HKU2/GD430 strain, supporting a common ancestry (Pan et al., 2017). Interestingly, SeACoV and HKU2 possess unique S genes that are closely related to the betacoronaviruses (Lau et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2017). Most recently, Yu et al reported cryo-EM structures for HKU2 and SeACoV S protein trimers, which are available in the open access preprint repository (Yu et al., 2020). The trimeric structures of HKU2 and SeACoV S proteins (resolutions of 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5, respectively) are very similar, with differences mainly found in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, which is responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. Both the HKU2 and SeACoV S protein carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) structures have a single-layer core consisting of a twisted, five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet similar to the betacoronaviruses (Yu et al., 2020). This suggests recombination between alpha- and betacoronavirus S glycoproteins, and reflects the evolutionary origin of the HKU2/SeACoV S protein at a structural level. Although the S2 subunit (which mediates membrane fusion) is also conserved, the conformation of the region after the fusion peptide of the HKU2-CoV and SeACoV S2 subunits are different from other CoVs. These results provide structural evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between HKU2-related CoV and betacoronavirus S proteins, and provide new insights into CoV evolution and cross-species transmission (Yu et al., 2020).",

            "text": "M and E proteins are major components of the viral envelope and are required for the viral assembly process (de Haan et al., 2000). Apart from that, the N protein is the most highly conserved structural protein among CoVs, and plays an important role in the packaging of virus particles via binding to the viral genomic RNA (Nelson et al., 2000). Specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are usually generated based on viral structural proteins, and immunofluorescence assay using pAbs against N, M and S1 proteins have been used to detect SeACoV infection in cultured cells. Anti-N and anti-M pAbs have also been used for specific detection of SeACoV infection with expected molecular size (42- and 25-KDa, respectively) by western blot (Yang et al., 2019a) or immunohistochemistry (Yang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2018b). In addition, rabbit antiserum against SeACoV Nsp3 acidic domain has been validated for use in the time course analysis of viral protein expression using confocal images, which detected the Nsp3 expression as early as 4 h post-infection in SeACoV-infected cells (Yang et al., 2019a). Accessory proteins play an important role in the immune modulation and viral pathogenesis of CoVs (Liu et al., 2014). Three accessory proteins (ORF3, NS7a and NS7b) have been identified within the SeACoV genome based on analysis of leader-body junctions in specific subgenomic mRNAs, though their functions remain to be confirmed experimentally (Yang et al., 2019a). Similar to the other CoVs like PEDV and TGEV (Ji et al., 2018; Ortego et al., 2003), ORF3 is dispensable for SeACoV infection in vitro since replacement with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in this position does not affect recovery of the recombinant virus (unpublished data).",

Twenty-one of the 24 tested cell lines showed significant susceptibility to SeACoV infection, defined by efficient viral antigen expression and increased viral RNA titers (Yang et al., 2019b). Notably, SeACoV infects both primary and passaged cell lines of rodent origin, suggesting that rodents may be susceptible to SeACoV infection. In most cases, exogenous trypsin enhanced the propagation of SeACoV in susceptible cell lines. HeLa cells showed the highest susceptibility based on viral load detected in culture supernatants by quantitative RT-PCR (Yang et al., 2019b). This study revealed a remarkably broad spectrum of SeACoV tropism in vitro, and suggested exogenous trypsin treatment and endogenous protease on the cell membrane may activate the fusion of SeACoV S protein for efficient cell entry and release (Yang et al., 2019b).",

Recently, our lab developed a DNA-launched reverse genetics system for SeACoV (the infectious clone \u201cpSEA\u201d) (Yang et al., 2019a). The full-length consensus cDNA sequence of SeACoV (27,155 nt) was assembled and inserted into a modified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) backbone plasmid that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter, a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence and terminator. In addition, two silent mutations (A24222 T and G24223C) in ORF3 were introduced in pSEA as a genetic marker to differentiate the parental virus. The recombinant SeACoV with the genetic marker can be recovered by direct transfection of cells with pSEA and a helper plasmid expressing the N gene, with similar growth kinetics to the parental virus (Yang et al., 2019a). This plasmid-based system was applied to determine whether a SeACoV non-susceptible cell line, MDCK (canine kidney cells), could confer SeACoV replication competency by transfection of pSEA (Yang et al., 2019b). By introducing desired mutations into viral structural and nonstructural genes, the SeACoV reverse genetics system will facilitate functional analysis of replication and packaging signals, and can be exploited to engineer recombinant SeACoV for design of attenuated vaccines. Most recently, a reporter virus expressing GFP by replacement of ORF3 was generated to track SeACoV in cell culture based on this system in our lab (unpublished data), which will also allow for high-throughout screening of antivirals in the future.",

Thus, it is necessary to track the evolution of the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 in order to better understand its epidemiology and prevent further outbreaks and spread in China.

SeACoV interfered with the activity of IPS-1 and RIG-I to inhibit the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 to block IFN-\u03b2 production (Zhou et al., 2019b). In addition, SeACoV can induce apoptosis via caspase-dependent FasL and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways (Zhang et al., 2020). These studies provide insights into the comprehensive understanding of the interactions between SeACoV and susceptible hosts. A mouse infection model has been established for SeACoV with active viral replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SeACoV may be susceptible to rodents (Yang et al., 2019b). In this study, mice exhibited only subclinical infection, and seem to be more susceptible by the intraperitoneal route, with modest replication in intestinal tissues and titers declining around 3 days post-infection (Yang et al., 2019b).",

Initially, it was believed that SeACoV causes enteric disease with a mortality rate over 35% in piglets less than 10 days old (Zhou et al., 2018b). Its clinical symptoms were similar to PEDV and TGEV, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b). Although the viruses isolated from different groups were able to infect piglets by the oral route, they each caused mild or severe diarrhea symptom (Pan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018b). In a challenge experiment on 4-day-old piglets using a cell culture strain GDS04-P12, clinical signs developed gradually and the virus was shed in the feces throughout the experimental period (Xu et al., 2019). All piglets (n = 10) challenged with the virus died from 5 to 12 days post-infection (dpi). Examination of the affected pigs revealed that the small intestine had accumulated a large amount of yellow liquid in the colon and the cecum, the intestine was inflated, and the intestinal wall was thin and transparent. SeACoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the challenged piglets by immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathology revealed that the intestinal villi of the duodenum, jejunum, and other places had varying degrees of atrophy, and the intestinal epithelium also showed necrosis (Xu et al., 2019). These results indicated that GDS04-P12 is highly pathogenic to the newborn piglets. A pathogenesis study using the cell culture strain CN/GDWT/2017 from the group that designated the virus \u201cSADS-CoV\u201d also showed high mortality (3/6) in the inoculated 3-day-old piglets (Zhou et al., 2018b). However, immunohistochemical analysis displayed only a few jejunal epithelial cells that were stained with viral antigen in challenged piglets, which may not be in line with the 50% mortality (Zhou et al., 2018b). We have conducted a couple of experimental infection of neonatal piglets with a moderate or high dose of purified SeACoV (isolate CH/GD-01/2017), and they resulted only in mild-moderate diarrheal signs or subclinical infection compared to the first outbreaks in pig herds [(Pan et al., 2017) and unpublished data], implying a lower pathogenicity of SeACoV.",

Rather, a couple of HKU2-like CoV sequences, designated SADSr-CoV (Fig. 3), were determined in several species of horseshoe bats such as Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus sinicus, and Rhinolophus rex from seven different locations in Guangdong province between 2013 and 2016 (Zhou et al., 2018b). The S proteins of two SADSr-CoVs identified from Rhinolophus affinis were more closely related to that of SeACoV (\u223c98% aa sequence identity), indicating that horseshoe bats are reservoirs of HKU2-like CoVs. The phylogenetic, haplotype network and recombination analyses suggested that SeACoV had probably been introduced from these HKU2-like CoVs independently, and that some strains might have undergone further intragenotypic recombination (Zhou et al., 2018b). However, it is still not clear how the virus was transmitted from bats to pigs.

According to our onsite observation in 2017, rodents were frequently visible in these pig farms. Notably, bat HKU2-like CoVs are clustered with rat CoVs in the genus Alphacoronavirus (Fig. 3). As we found that SeACoV infects different cell lines originating from rodents, and mice may be susceptible to SeACoV experimental infection (Yang et al., 2019b), we hypothesize that in such field conditions, rodents (especially wild rats) in the farms may eat pig feed contaminated by bat feces, becoming carriers of SeACoV (Fig. 4). Alternatively, if pigs became infected and shed SeACoV-positive feces, the virus could begin circulating in pig facilities. Contamination of pig feed, pig feces and water supplies by rodents could accumulate and develop into outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal piglets (Fig. 4). Future studies on identifying HKU2-like CoV positive samples in rodents near pig farms are warranted to test this hypothesis.",

After the complete genome of SeACoV was determined, multiple rapid PCR detection methods were subsequently developed (Table 1). Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and real-time RT-PCR assays were established for the detection of SeACoV (Wang et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018a). Real-time RT-PCR is more powerful than RT-LAMP, with greater sensitivity and reproducibility for better quantification of pathogen. SYBR green-based and TaqMan-based methods have been developed for several SeACoV isolates (Ma et al., 2018). Since the S gene is more prone to mutation and recombination, PCR-based methods mainly target the relatively conserved N and M gene. In addition there is a multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of swine enteric PEDV, PDCoV (both targeting the M gene), TGEV and SeACoV (both targeting the N gene) (Huang et al., 2019).",

The ELISA uses a luciferase immunoprecipitation system based on the S1 protein, and has been used to investigate possible zoonotic transmission (Zhou et al., 2018b). In addition, there is a virion-based ELISA detection method designed for sample detection in mouse model experiments, which can also be used for pig serum samples (Yang et al., 2019b).",

Although the virus reemerged in Fujian in 2018 and Guangdong in 2019, there have not been large-scale losses reported, which is positive news for its prevention and control. However, it is strange that SeACoV has not resulted in a large-scale epidemic in the pig industry in Guangdong in recent years, similar to the way SARS-CoV emerged in 2003 and then basically disappeared (Ksiazek et al., 2003) until the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 (Zhou et al., 2020). This outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and current pandemic also requires strict control to ensure the health of people around the world. Since all CoVs have the capability for recombination, no CoV epidemic can be taken lightly, even those in pigs (Opriessnig and Huang, 2020). To prevent future outbreaks, unified detection methods are needed to establish better surveillance of SeACoV, including virological and serological methods.",

The presumed name \u201cSADS-CoV\u201d may not be appropriate since the available pathogenicity studies have not provided strong evidence of high virulence. The reverse genetic system for SeACoV has been established successfully in our lab (Yang et al., 2019a), which will facilitate future studies exploring the molecular mechanisms of SeACoV replication and pathogenicity. With the structural analysis of SeACoV and HKU2 S glycoproteins, it is also important to identify the primary receptor and study the mechanism of receptor binding. It is clear now more than ever that CoV-induced diseases not only pose a huge threat to the pig industry but also to human health. If HKU2-related CoVs emerge again, causing unknown damage to the pig industry, such basic research on SeACoV will be necessary to prevent and control future epidemics.",
