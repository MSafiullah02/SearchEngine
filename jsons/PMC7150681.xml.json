            "text": "The causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belongs to group III Coronaviruses of family Coronaviridae. IBV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kb. Four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)) were reported to be encoded by the IBV genome [2]. The glycosylated S protein is posttranslationally cleaved by cellular proteases into S1, which forms the spike bulb, and S2, which anchors S1 to the virion membrane. The S1 and S2 subunits have been shown to mediate viral attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. Virus neutralizing epitopes are located in the first and third quarters of the S1 glycoprotein [2, 3]. Three hypervariable regions (HVR)-1, 2, and 3 were reported to be located in the S1 subunit between amino acids 38 to 67, 91 to 141, and 274 to 387, respectively [4]. Genetic variability of these HVRs due to mutations and/or recombination was incriminated in the continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes/genotypes [5]. In this regard, substitution of 10 to 15 amino acids (2-3%) in the S1 subunit has been shown to result in generation of a new serotype [6].",

Vaccination is the primary measure used to control IBV infection, but caution must be taken when choosing a vaccine strain(s) that should be homologous with the circulating IBV serotype(s). Vaccination-challenge studies have shown that protection by heterologous vaccines ranges between very poor to moderate depending on the criteria used. Poor cross protection may be induced by as little as a 5% difference in the S1 amino acid sequence, while most IBV serotypes differ from each other by 20\u201325% and up to 50% [6]. Accordingly, S1 nucleotide sequence similarity and genotyping approaches have been used successfully to predict cross-protection and circulating serotypes, with some exceptions [8, 9]. Recently, IBV was genotyped based on S1 sequences into 6 major genotypes (Genotype I (GI) to GVI] containing 32 lineages [10].",

The 4/91 IBV serotype (GI-13 lineage) was detected in Saudi Arabia in 2000 [12]. Vaccine strains belonging to this serotype and the Mass serotype (GI-1 lineage), such as H120 and Ma5, are in use to control IB occurrence; however, IB still occurs due to the CH/CK/LDL/97I (GI-16) lineage, the Middle East (GI-23) lineage (IS/720/99 and IS/Variant2/98), and D274 (GI-12) lineage [13, 14]. Strains similar to those circulating in Egypt, India, China, and Italy have also been reported in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia [15]. In the present study, we report the IBV lineages circulating in 115 broiler chicken flocks in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia.",

Tissue samples, such as trachea, lung, spleen, kidney, and bursa of Fabricius, were collected from birds showing signs of respiratory illness. Although not always successful, attempts were made to collect various organs and a complete history from the sampled flocks. For each flock, each organ was pooled together from all sampled birds. Tissue samples were collected in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing gentamicin and nystatin (50 \u03bcg of each/ml). The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being homogenized. Homogenization was performed using the Omni International Ceramic bead kit and the BioSpecMini-Beadbeater-16 instrument. For each organ, viral nucleic acids were extracted from homogenized tissues with the IQEasy Plus Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (Cat #17153, iNtRON Biotechnology, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being tested by RT-PCR.

A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method with bootstrap values of 1000 replicates. Twenty-nine IBV reference sequences were included (Figure 1). The overall mean distance was used as an indicator of sequence divergence for the Saudi isolates and was shown as the number of different bases per sequence from averaged overall sequence pairs.

This finding was not surprising because the original CK/CH/LDL/97I strain was isolated from an H120-vaccinated flock. Likewise, a vaccination-challenge experiment showed that heterologous vaccines did not provide sufficient protection against CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV. In contrast, complete protection was provided by a homologous vaccine derived from the same type and attenuated by passaging in embryonated hen eggs [34]. In Saudi Arabia, the high prevalence of this lineage in broiler chickens appears to be facilitated by an immunity gap created by use of only heterologous vaccines. A similar scenario was suggested for spread of the IT-02 IBV strain in Spanish 4/91-vaccinated flocks [9].",

Conversely, four of these nine flocks received only the Mass vaccine, and the vaccination history was not available for the ninth flock. Keeping in mind that approximately 70% of the 4/91-like sequences were vaccine-identical, and this lineage contains some isolates that displayed relatively high sequence divergence (Table 3). Heavy vaccine application may contribute to such divergence, as previously suggested by Lee and Jackwood [35]. In contrast, the CK/CH/LDL/97I lineage showed the lowest divergence, which could further support our justification of the low immune pressure exerted by the used vaccines on CK/CH/LDL/97I lineage viruses.",

On the contrary, two out of the eight Mass isolates showed incomplete identity with Mass vaccines (SA/IH20/13 and SA/IC79/13). SA/IH20/13 showed 99.6% nucleotide identity with the Mass vaccine sequence and was recovered from a Mass-vaccinated flock (Table 2).

Nucleotide mutations and subsequent amino acid substitutions may affect vaccine protectivity or even lead to vaccine reversion.

Likewise, other lineages were reported in surrounding countries but not in Saudi Arabia or vice versa; for example, the QX (or GI-19) lineage was detected at rates of 7% and 8% in Iran and 9% in Iraq [29\u201331]. Similarly, Ganapathy and colleagues (2015) detected the D274 (or GI-12) lineage at a frequency of once out of 236 samples during the period from 2009 to 2014, whereas we did not detect this lineage at the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia during the period from 2012 to 2014. Similarly, the CK/CH/LDL/97I lineage was prevalent in Saudi Arabia but not in surrounding countries. Several factors may contribute to this inconsistency, including but not limited to the following: (1) differences in the sampled population, such as those that arise from sampling different birds (broilers, layers, breeders etc.); (2) serotype(s) of the used vaccines, frequency of their application, and the protection they provide against the circulating genotypes; (3) the effect of migratory birds and localization of the sampled flocks on the migration route [40, 41]; (4) applied biosecurity measures; and (5) exchange of poultry products between countries and regions [13]. Additionally, testing different tissues would also contribute to variation in the detection rates. IBV vaccine and field viruses, or their genome/antigen, were detected in variety of tissues [42\u201344] and reported to persist in some viscera, particularly cecal tonsils [18, 45\u201348]. Consequently, testing the latter tissue would increase the detection rate on the one hand and increase the fraction contributed by vaccine viruses, on the other hand, as previously speculated by Callison and others [49].",

Since being introduced, this method has been frequently used for IBV genotyping [14, 29, 50\u201352]. Advantages and disadvantages of full and partial sequencing of IBV-S1 gene was previously reported [53]. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the partial (HVR-3) S1 gene sequences published by Valastro et al. [10], all of the lineages involved in the present study (G1-1, -13, -16, and -23) formed distinct and well-supported clusters (Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa-like test support values of \u22650.93). Indeed, Valastro et al. specify 8 lineages (GI-5, -7, -10, -18, -22, -24, -25, and -27) that loss their unity in phylogeny when using the partial 342 nt. encoding the HVR3 [10]. However, the main limitation of the current work is the partial sequence of the S1 gene that was used for phylogenetic analysis. Full S1 gene sequence would provide more accurate analysis especially for differentiation between field and vaccine viruses.",
