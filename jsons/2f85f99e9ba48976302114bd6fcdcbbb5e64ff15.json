It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties. Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making them effective against diseases. Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile. The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders. These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis. Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.",

The respiratory system, comprising of the nose, nasal cavities and the lung, is the sole internal system that is exposed to the external environment. Hence, it is easily susceptible to environmental agents (such as bacterial or viral infections, smoking, air pollution or cold weather [2] ), that can cause respiratory diseases. Importantly, chronic respiratory diseases are a great cause of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f concern as approximately one billion people suffer from them while four million succumb to these illnesses prematurely every year [2] . The Forum of International Respiratory societies identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, acute respiratory infections, and lung cancer as the top few respiratory diseases that heavily burden society [2] . In brief, COPD is an obstructive lung disease characterized by long term breathing issues and poor airflow. It affects 200 million people and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [3] . It is currently being treated using inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids [4] . Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow and swell, and is accompanied by increased mucus production. It affects 300 million people worldwide [5] . The cause of asthma is still unknown, and it is furthermore uncurable. Treatment is limited to symptom relief using inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators [5] . Acute respiratory infections include pneumonia and viral respiratory infections. Annually, respiratory tract infections like influenza kill 250,000 to 500,000 people and cost billions of dollars. In addition, it occasionally causes epidemics that threaten the health of the global population [6] . Lung cancer is a malignant lung tumour that is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissues, and this growth can spread to other parts of the body, causing death. It has the highest fatality rate amongst the major cancers, killing more than 1.4 million people a year [7] . Patients are diagnosed and their disease is classified into different stages where earlier-stage patients are treated with surgery to remove the lung tumour, while late-stage patients are treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy but often succumb to the disease [2] . Currently, the global approach to managing respiratory diseases is to provide better healthcare, reduce environmental pollution, and to create public awareness of the prevalence and risks of such diseases. Research in this field explores the causes of these respiratory diseases, prognostic markers to better diagnose patients and new therapies that can maintain and contain the disease [2] . Nonetheless, a lot more work will need to be done to find safer and more effective treatment methods.",

It is isolated from the leafy parts of Artemisia annua, a herb and medicinal plant that has been used for the treatment of chills and fever for centuries [13] . In the 1960s, the search for new anti-malarial drugs began in lieu of the increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine. Artemisinin, also known as Qinghaosu, was first isolated. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was subsequently the first generation of derivatives, made by modifying the carbonyl groups into hydroxyl groups [12] . Others like the more water-soluble artesunate and more oil-soluble artemether and arteether followed [14] . These derivatives were ten times more potent than artemisinin [12] , with artesunate having a more favourable pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic profile [15] . They are also more easily produced [12] (Table 1) . Artemisinins and its derivates are selectively taken up by parasites-infected erythrocytes and later localized in the parasite membranes, including that of the mitochondria, digestive vacuole and the parasite limiting membrane [12, 14] . All forms of the drug contain an endoperoxide bridge (C-O-O-C) that is crucial for its antimalarial activity, where the compound itself is catalyzed by heme or iron to form free radicals. These free radicals then alkylate malaria membrane-associated proteins, killing the parasite [14] . Artemisinin and its derivatives are found to be effective against different severities of malaria, especially those resistant to traditional gold standard drugs. They are highly efficacious, requiring only nanomolar concentrations in vitro [14] . They are also fast-acting, showing therapeutic potential as early as 20 hours after administration. Moreover, artemisinins display a relatively safe toxicity profile, with the LD50 being 4223 mg/kg. In addition, whilst there was some evidence for neurotoxicity in neuronal cells and animals at high dosages, this was never reported in humans despite the wide usage of the drug [12, 14] .",

Artesunate displayed anti-inflammatory properties, as seen by its attenuation of the production of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1-stimulated rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA FLS) via the regulation of NF-\u03baB and phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathways [18] . It also displayed anti-viral properties where artemisinin inhibited the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) through a reduction in the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB and Sp1, and subsequently downstream activities of Akt1 and p70S6K. [19] . Many of these pathophysiological processes are also present in respiratory diseases.

BEAS-2B cells Artemisinin-daumone hybrid 15 (ARTD) was able to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of A549 cells, coupled with downregulation of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), and upregulation of tumour-suppressive activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) [58] .

            "text": "Multiple studies have shown that artemisinin and its derivatives could chemosensitize other drugs. 10 \u00b5g/ml of DHA and 10 \u00b5g/ml of doxorubicin was found to be the most optimal concentrations that could reduce A549 cell viability [59] . DHA promoted the cytotoxic and apoptotic levels of carboplatin in LLC cells via the phosphorylation of p38 [36] . DHA together with ABT-263 could activate Bax-dependent apoptosis in NSCLC cells. This was because DHA induced downregulation of survivin and an upregulation of Bim, contributing to cotreatment-induced cytotoxicity. Also, DHA downregulated Mcl-1 expression which is responsible for drug resistance to ABT-263. This anti-tumour effect was also observed in vivo on H1975 xenograft growth in nude mice [48] . Similarly, DHA also upregulated Bax expression in the presence of gefitinib in H1975 cells, alongside an attenuation of p-Akt, p-mTOR, psignal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and Bcl-2 to prevent migration and invasion [38] . Surprisingly, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 synergistically promoted DHA-induced cell apoptosis in A549 and ASTC-a-1 cells by activating Bax translocation, mitochondrial membrane depolarisation, cytochrome c release and caspase 3 and 9, unlike its usual anti-apoptotic function that suppresses c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bax [60] . DHA also interestingly promoted dictamine-induced apoptosis via a caspase 3-mediated pathway in A549 cells, even though dictamine alone induces S phase cell cycle arrest at low concentrations and cell apoptosis at higher concentrations without the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f involvement of caspases or mitochondria [61] . DHA and cisplatin ablated cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both A549 and cisplatin-insensitive A549/DDP cells [56] . DHA could also reverse the high resistance of A549 cells to arsenic trioxide to reduce cell viability and promote cell death via higher levels of ROS and DNA damage, with no adverse effects on normal human bronchial epithelial cells [62] . On the contrary, apoptosis triggered by a combination of DHA and gemcitabine in A549 cells was not associated with additional generation of ROS as compared to either treatments alone. Instead, the combination strongly activated both the Bak-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway as well as the Fascaspase 8-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway [63] . Moreover, DHA can enhance radiosensitization in GLC-82 lung cancer cells, inducing apoptosis with heightened expressions of p53 and p21, and lowered expression of Bcl-2 [37] . DHA coupled with a low dose of ionizing radiation led to irreparable G2/M phase cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis due to ROS generation and the activation of caspases 3 and 8 [39] . In SCLC, pre-treatment with transferrin sensitized the multi-resistant H69VP phenotype to artemisinin as they had double the number of transferrin receptors. This combination induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis [64] . Treating A549 cells with chloroquine prior to artesunate treatment synergistically promoted cell death, where an increase in the sub-G1 population of cells was observed, and the build-up of acidic vacuoles and ROS resulted in cytochrome c release followed by caspase 3mediated apoptosis [33] . Conversely, artesunate did not induce A549 cell apoptosis when administered alone or in the presence of local radiotherapy. Instead, it induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, with heightened NO protein, and lessened cyclin B1 and cdc2 mRNA expression [40] . All these studies show that various therapies can be used in conjunction with artemisinins to promote its therapeutic effectiveness.",

Artemisitene reduced bleomycin-induced acute inflammatory responses through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, as seen by a reduction in the total number of inflammatory cells, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, together with lower IL-4, IL-6, tumomur growth factor (TGF)\u03b2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expressions [66] . Artesunate treatment attenuated lung injury in paraquat-intoxicated rats via reductions in TGF\u03b21, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 [70] . 30 mg/kg of artesunate suppressed total, eosinophil and neutrophil inflammatory cell counts as well in an OVAinduced model of allergic asthma [68] . It also reduced IL-8 levels and total inflammatory and neutrophil cell counts that were increased in a 40 days cigarette smoke-induced lung oxidative damage mouse model. IL-8 levels were similarly lowered by artesunate in 16HBE cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract [69] . Interestingly, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was dependent on pulmonary ROS generation accompanied by higher ASC and caspase 1 levels [53].

DHA was observed to display poor water solubility and short plasma halflife. Dai and colleagues connected DHA with a multiarm polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce PEG-DHA and found that it was 82 to 163 times more water-soluble and its blood circulation half-time was 5.75 to 16.75 times that of DHA, all while retaining or improving its anti-cancer efficacy [92] . Sun and colleagues encapsulated DHA with gelatin or hyaluronan nanoparticles using an electrostatic field system and observed that it inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of A549 cells better than DHA [93] . DHA loaded with nanostructured lipid carriers (DHA-NLC) resided more greatly in organs such as the lung, liver, spleen, brain, and muscle, and less in the heart and kidneys, promoting sustained-release and better drug-targeted effects, therefore allowing for lower dosages and systemic toxic side effects [94] . A C-10 acetal artemisinin synthesized using the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction displayed higher growth inhibition of A549 cells compared to artemisinin. However, it only had moderate effects on other cancer cell lines such as breast, prostate, and neuroblastoma [95] . Lastly,",

DHA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and GLC-82 human lung cancer cells, with a reduction in the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases[36,37]. Chen and colleagues reported that DHA inhibited A549 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner after 96 hours of treatment, with an increase in the number of G0 and G1 cells. The population doubling time in DHA-treated cells also lengthened as compared to the control group (38.5 vs 21.3 hours)[24]. On the other hand, DHA induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in NCI-H1975 human lung adenocarcinoma cells with a marked reduction in the protein expressions of cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1[38]. Together with 24 hours of ionizing radiation treatment, DHA induced a G2/M phase arrest that disappeared 36 hours after treatment[39].Similarly, artesunate enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549 cells with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, with lower cyclin B1 mRNA levels and a heightened nitric oxide (NO) production[40]. G2/M phase arrest was also induced with artesunate in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, and this effect was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f synergistic with cisplatin, with a reduction in phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4EBP1[41]. Artesunate treatment reduced cell numbers in A549, HCT116, and MCF7 cells but did not reduce cell viability in A549 and MCF7 cells, suggesting a cytostatic effect. Interestingly, the sub-G1 population increased in HCT116 cells but there were no significant changes in the cell cycle phases in A549 and MCF7 cells, suggesting a simultaneous blockade at all cell cycle phases[42].

Artesunate was found to promote ROS-mediated apoptosis in A549 and ASTC-a-1 cells in a time-and concentration-dependent fashion with a loss of mitochondrial potential and release of Smac and AIF[44]. In both A549 and ASTC-a-1 cells, treatment triggered apoptosis through an increase in ROS levels, with the activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9 without the cleavage of Bid[26,27, 45].",

Non-canonical apoptotic pathways were also found to be involved in the action of artemisinins. DHAinduced PC-14 lung cancer cell apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium ion levels ([Ca 2+ ]i) and activation of p38 [25]. DHA also downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of survivin in SPC-A-1 lung cancer cells to induce apoptosis but did not affect caspase 4 expression [47]. DHA attenuated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation, resulting in the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin levels in ABT-263 NSCLC cells possessing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or RAS mutations [48].

Similarly, pre-treatment of A549 cells with artesunate saw a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 and IL-8 generation, with no effect on cell viability[52]. Artesunate mitigated hypoxia/reoxygenation-mediated increase in ROS levels in alveolar macrophages, together with reductions in NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) protein abundance, caspase 1 activity and production, and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 mRNA and protein levels [53]. 3.5 Inhibition of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis Angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis are processes by which cancer cells spread. Artesunate impaired matrigel invasion of six NSCLC cell lines via the inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), MMP2 and MMP7 promoter or enhancer activities, mRNA and protein expressions, with corresponding reductions in activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-\u03baB [54]. Another group also observed that artesunate inhibited invasion of A549 cells using the transwell chamber invasion assay [30]. Similarly, a low concentration of DHA blocked in vitro migration and invasion of NSCLC cells through the downregulation of NF-\u03baB levels that inhibited GLUT translocation and the Warburg effect J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [55]. DHA also enhanced the suppression of vascularisation-related proteins hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and VEGF by cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo [56]. Artemisinin pre-treatment ablated IL-1\u03b2-induced p38 activation and VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression in LLC cells, factors associated with cancer and lymphangiogenesis. This effect was similar to that observed with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, suggesting the role of p38 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine-inducer of VEGF-C [57].",

DHA treatment increased lung tissue mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as compared to rats stimulated with intratracheal administration of bleomycin over 14 days. This was with heightened levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), and suppressed levels of malondialdehyde (MDA)[65]. Bleomycininduced lung damage in mice was significantly inhibited by i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg artemisitene through its activation of Nrf2 and subsequently an increase in the mRNA expression of its downstream genes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and HO-1[66]. Artesunate treatment led to a furtherincrement in LPS-induced increase in Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions in LPS-induced ALI [52]. Artesunate and biotinylated dihydroartesunate (BDHA) increased nuclear Nrf2 levels in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells via direct molecular interaction with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) to free Nrf2 for transcriptional activity [67]. Similarly, artesunate promoted nuclear levels of Nrf2 in asthmatic mouse lung tissues sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), and TNF-\u03b1 stimulated BEAS-2B cells. Surprisingly, HO-1 expression was reduced by artesunate in this mouse model of allergic asthma. Artesunate also reduced the expressions of oxidative damage markers 8-isoprostane, 8-hydroxy-2deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and the gene expression of regulatory subunitsof NADPH oxidase (NOX)2, NOX4, p22phox, and p67phox. Expressions of SOD, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and NOX1-4 were also reduced while that of catalase increased with artesunate treatment[68]. In cigarette smoke-induced lung oxidative damage in mice, artesunate also stimulated Nrf2 expression while reducing SOD activity, 3-NT and MDA[69]. In both allergic asthma and cigarette smoke-induced lung oxidative damage, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were consistently unaffected by artesunate treatment[68,69]. In COPD animal models, artesunate dose-dependentlyablated the expression of 8-isoprostane, 8OHdG and 3-NT in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), promoted catalase activity and reduced NOX2 protein expression in the mice lungs [51]. 4.2 Inhibition of inflammation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

In asthma, artesunate dose-dependently suppressed airway inflammation as observed in acute mouse models of allergic asthma. 30 mg/kg of artesunate attenuated total inflammatory and eosinophil counts when house dust mites were used as the allergen, while total inflammatory and eosinophil cell counts, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin in BALF were found to be attenuated when OVA was used[74]. Luo and colleagues also noted similar reductions in total and differential cell counts, IL-4, IL-8, IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1, accompanied by reductions in p110\u03b4PI3K and p-Akt1, suggesting the involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway[50]. Likewise, the same dose of DHA, although J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f administered intragastrically, also attenuated airway inflammation by reducing the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IgE levels. This was accompanied by reductions in p-ERK, p-p38, (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB alpha) I\u03baB\u03b1 and p-NF-\u03baB p65 protein abundance[75]. DHA and artesunate were also found to ablate the mRNA levels of molecules involved in promoting airway inflammation and remodelling, including chitinase 3-like protein 4 (Ym2)[75], chitinase-like glycoprotein (YKL-40), iNOS, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin[74]. Zhu and colleagues found that DHA significantly relieved airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and mucus secretion in OVA-stimulated mice by reducing the percentage of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. This was through the abolishment of IL-6 and STAT3 expression, which was due to a reduction in the transcriptional levels of miR-183-5p, miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p, and an increase in transcriptional and translational expression of forkhead box O1 (Foxo1)[76]. Lastly, artemisinin with or without neurectomy of pterygoid canal reduced the levels of histamine, IgE, TNF, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10, and raised the proportion of regulatory T (Treg) cells in OVAinduced allergic rhinitis in mice[77].",

These include inhibition of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and promotion of oxidative stress. In vivo studies additionally examined the effects of artemisinins in structural changes and functional assays. To date, a large proportion of studies have been conducted in lung cancer, with not much done in other respiratory diseases. Yet, many of the physiological processes that occur in lung cancer are observed in other respiratory diseases. This includes, but is not limited to, cell proliferation and inflammatory events. Therefore, there is potential for artemisinins to be used to mitigate other respiratory diseases and that needs to be explored.Fig. 2summarizes the different ranges of concentrations of artemisinins used in the in vitro studies of different processes involved in the respiratory diseases explored. It is interesting to observe that larger and higher ranges of concentrations were used in cell proliferation and apoptosis studies, which could possibly be attributed to the higher concentrations needed to produce a cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. A moderate range of artemisinin concentrations was applied in studies looking at inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, whilst lowest concentrations were used in airway wall remodelling (AWR) and lung function studies. This could indicate that different concentrations, and even drug formulation, could be pegged according to the disease type and process to reduce the potential side effects. It is also interesting to note that a large proportion of studies have been conducted in vitro, especially for studying the mechanisms affecting cell/tumour proliferation and apoptosis. More of these could be studied in vivo as the dosages of artemisinins are known and welltolerated in animals. Nonetheless, given that artemisinins are already approved for use in clinics and many clinical studies conducted in malaria have shown that the drug is well-tolerated, artemisinins would make a strong drug candidate that can be repurposed as therapy for a wide spectrum of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respiratory diseases, and could potentially be an option for the urgent treatment for the COVIDof Education's Academic Research Fund Tier 1 (T1-2014 Apr-03) to Thai Tran.",
