These include viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and prions. Strictly defined, not all infectious diseases common to animals and humans are zoonotic, and they can contract pathogens from the same sources, i.e., soil, water, plants, and invertebrates. For instance, acquisition of common human pathogens [Escherichia coli, Enterococci spp.] from animal food source with multiple antimicrobial resistance profile due to the liberal usage of antibiotics in animal feed may not be considered as zoonoses. Zoonotic diseases are due to transmissible infectious agents that affect more than one animal species, including humans, and cause clinical or subclinical infections. The resurgence of zoonotic infectious diseases in the past two decades globally is of major concern. These diseases have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality on a large segment of the global human population, with over a billion afflicted resulting in millions of annual deaths [1] . Moreover, outbreaks of zoonoses have had adverse impact on regional economies as a result of huge financial burden on the affected communities, but also indirectly affecting commerce or trade with more affluent consumer countries from the fear of spreading the affliction to their population. A systematic survey in 2007 estimated that in 1399 species of human pathogens, 87 of which were first reported in humans since 1980, most were viruses of animal reservoirs [1] . The World Organization for Animal Health estimates that 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from domestic or wild animals, appealing for collaboration between animal health and human public health organizations and authorities [www.oie.int/int/edito/en-avr09.htm]. A new strategy to incorporate animal health data to assist public health authorities was adopted by the European Union under the One Health concept [2] . The socioecology of zoonoses is complex and dynamic, and the epidemiology and resurgence of these diseases are influenced by various conditions that can be classified as human related, pathogen related, animal/host related, and climate/environment related [3] .

Direct contact with animals or carcasses can result in transmission of disease by a few different ways, most commonly by oral ingestion as in foodborne zoonoses, or accidentally from handling pets without proper hand sanitization. Transmission of disease by animal bites, scratches, or mucosal exposure to infected secretions occurs relatively infrequently, such as in rabies and animal-related wound infections. Exposure to animal pathogens can be through inhalation of droplets of infected secretions, as believed to have occurred in China with local outbreaks of avian influenza arising from exposures to infected fowls or ducks in open markets.

Estimates of foodborne infections are even more difficult to derive in developing countries, where there are inadequate facilities and healthcare infrastructure and the global burden of foodborne zoonoses is the greatest. It is estimated that each year at least one-third of world's population is afflicted with foodborne infections and a large fraction from animal pathogens. International collaboration spearheaded by the World Health Organization [WHO] launched surveillance programs since 2000 to determine the burden of foodborne diseases in resource-poor countries and globally [6] . Previous estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in 2011 determined that 31 major pathogens acquired in the US caused at least 9.4 million episode of foodborne illness each year, but could be >48 million cases [7] . Common animal-derived pathogens such as nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Toxoplasma gondii were the leading causes of hospitalization [58%].

Infection may result from eating raw or undercooked animal products, or contaminated vegetables and fruits, or drinking contaminated water or milk [9] . Moreover, infections and outbreaks can occur from prepared food contaminated by an ill person or asymptomatic carrier. It is often difficult to trace animal-mediated infectious diseases from non-meat products as shown by recent experiences. This is exemplified by the outbreak in Europe of a novel Shiga toxin-producing E. coli 0104:H4 from contaminated sprouts originating in Germany, resulting in 50 deaths, and the outbreak in the US with Listeria-contaminated cantaloupes which killed 29 people [10] [11] [12] .

Although the majority of outbreaks of these bacterial zoonoses are related to \"high-risk\" foods commonly associated with illness, for instance, pink hamburger, raw oysters, unpasteurized milk or milk products [cheese], runny eggs, and alfalfa sprouts [15] , outbreaks have occurred with vegetables, fruits, peanut butter, and raw nuts [16] . The majority of resulting illnesses are usually self-limited gastroenteritis, but chronic complications may include irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis/ spondylitis, and rarely Guillain-Barre syndrome. These bacteria are widespread in nature and often colonize the intestines of many domestic and wild animals, i.e., poultry, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. Hence, raw meat from these animals are frequently contaminated with pathogenic bacteria during the preparation of carcasses for wholesale or retail in broilers and supermarkets, with poultry more frequently colonized with disease-producing bacteria than pork or beef. The European Food Safety Authority reported that poultry meats from broilers were contaminated by Campylobacter in 75.8% and by Salmonella in 15.6% [17] . However, even higher rates were reported in China with the presence of Campylobacter in carcasses of chicken in 94%, duck in 96%, rabbit in 97%, pork in 31%, and beef in 35% [18] . Salmonella contamination of meats for retail in the marketplace of China was somewhat less, with rates in chicken of 54%, in pork of 31%, in lamb of 20%, and in beef of 17% [19] . Recent reports in the US ranked the disease burden of food source infections and listed ten pathogen-food combinations, which included five pathogens [Campylobacter, Salmonella, norovirus, Listeria monocytogenes, and T. gondii], detected mainly from eight food categories, poultry, pork, deli meats, dairy, beef, eggs, farm produce and complex foods. Poultry was ranked as the number one cause of significant disease burden [mainly Campylobacter and Salmonella], followed by complex foods [83% caused by norovirus], and thirdly by pork [largely from T. gondii]. The five pathogens listed account for more than 50% of the total foodrelated illnesses due to 14 pathogens, responsible for $8 billion overall cost and 36,000 quality-adjusted life years [20] .

Listeria poses special risk in current trend of culinary habits, as 1-10% of ready-to-eat food may be contaminated with Listeria [22] ; and the bacteria can survive and grow at low temperatures, high salt level, and low pH used in food processing [23] . Contaminated food products with Listeria more commonly include unpasteurized milk and dairy products [soft and feta cheese] and meat from ruminants and sometimes poultry [24] . Listeriosis has a variable incubation period of 2-70 days and the food source is often difficult to ascertain. The Active Surveillance Network in the US reported 762 listeriosis cases over a 6-year period [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] , with an overall fatality rate of 18% [25] . However, most cases are unreported, and it is estimated that as many as 1600 cases of invasive listeriosis and 260 related deaths occur each year in the US [7] . In China L. monocytogenes had been recovered from about 4% of various types of prepared food samples and 6.28% of raw meat [26] . Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [STEC] is a foodborne zoonosis transmitted to humans from contaminated food and water or contact with infected animals or persons. Infections are caused predominantly by E. coli serotype 0157:H7, but novel serotypes are emerging that produces the toxin, as exemplified by the outbreak in Europe with E. coli 0104:H4 [10, 11] . Infections can result in acute uncomplicated diarrhea or with severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome with acute renal failure and death [mainly children under 10 years of age], and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [mostly in adults]. These severe complications occur in about 10% of infected subjects [27] . Infections with STEC are estimated to occur in about 265,630 persons with 31 deaths annually in the US [7] . Outbreaks of STEC infections occur worldwide but the global burden of disease is unknown. There are over 100 STEC serotypes, but most outbreaks and sporadic diseases are attributed to the 0157 serotype. The diagnosis is probably frequently missed as many laboratories only test for the 0157 STEC, without a test to detect Shiga toxin as recommended [28] . Shiga toxins [STXs] or verotoxins are potent cytotoxins, found mainly in zoonotic pathogenic E. coli, and are produced through lysogenic bacteriophages inserted into the chromosomes to encode the genes for six or more STXs [27] . Most STEC disease is the result of STX1 or STX2. Transmission of STEC readily occurs as the infectious dose is low [10-100 colonyforming units], and the bacteria are resistant to gastric acid [27] . The STECs are mainly found in cattle, sheep, and goats, but other animals can be carriers; and infection in humans mainly results from ingestion of undercooked beef or contaminated milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese and rarely from salads, vegetables, and apple juice [27] . The prevalence of STEC in cattle bowels ranges from 0.1 to 16%, and shedding of the pathogen in the excreta is intermittent [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 302, "end": 306, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 438, "end": 442, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 945, "end": 951, "text": "[2004]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 952, "end": 958, "text": "[2005]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 959, "end": 965, "text": "[2006]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 966, "end": 972, "text": "[2007]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 973, "end": 979, "text": "[2008]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 980, "end": 986, "text": "[2009]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1322, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1704, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1708, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2037, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2146, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2498, "end": 2502, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2524, "text": "[STXs]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2732, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2931, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3204, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3331, "end": 3335, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bacterial Foodborne Zoonoses"}, {"text": "The large outbreak of the hypervirulent STEC 0104:H4 that started in northern Germany and spread to 15 European countries in 2011 is unique.

However, this strain possessed several genes and virulence plasmids typical for enteroaggregative E. coli, carried primarily by humans [10] .

T. gondii is the most widespread parasitic infection in the world and infects half a billion people or onethird of the global population [27, 29] . The parasite infects a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, and nearly all warm-bloodied animals can be infected. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis varies greatly in different countries, which may be related to culinary habits and hygienic standards. Although toxoplasmosis can be transmitted from contamination of the hands while changing cat [kitten] liter from sporulated oocysts, most infection results from ingestion of raw or undercooked meat with tissue cysts. The prevalence of infection in cat ranges between 10 and 80%, and oocysts are shed only in the first 14 days of primary infection [36] . Consumption of raw or undercooked pork and lamb is most commonly implicated in the transmission of toxoplasmosis, less commonly from beef due to a short developmental stage in cattle, but infection can occur from eating raw/undercooked liver, caribou, and seal meat and rarely from drinking contaminated water [36] .

Consumption of undercooked infected meat and fish poses a major health risk to people of Asia and other tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Foodborne parasitic zoonoses are estimated to affect about 150 million people in China alone [31] . National surveys in China between 2001 and 2004 indicated that the number of people affected with clonorchiasis, trichinellosis, paragonimiasis, and angiostrongyloidiasis had increased compared to previous surveys in 1988-1992 and are of public health concern [31, 37] . Clonorchis sinensis is a trematode that can be asymptomatic or cause liver/biliary tract disease in all Asian countries from consumption of raw freshwater fish or shrimps; and it is estimated to that 35 million people who are infected globally, with 15 million residing in China [31] . The cycle of the liver fluke is perpetuated by fecal contamination of freshwater by animal hosts [humans, pigs, cats, and rats], with ingestion of larvae by snails and release of cercariae to infect fish. Eradication and control has been difficult as rice paddies, swamps, ponds, and streams commonly have infected fish [mainly carps], which is a main source of food supply. In some provinces of China, about 17% of freshwater fish are infected with C. sinensis, and rates of infection in the population vary from 4.75% to 31.6% [31, 38] . Despite the common practice of eating raw fish [sushi] in Japan, clonorchiasis is very rare, as the fish is mainly from the sea. The bulk of the infected people with clonorchiasis are asymptomatic, but heavy burden of infection for many years can result in gallbladder and liver disease, cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. Viral zoonoses transmitted by food are few in number and include mainly hepatitis E and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] which are reviewed in separate chapters. Prion, a transmissible altered protein, was first recognized to cause disease in sheep [scrapie] for more than 50 years, but more recent transmission to humans from consumption of beef from cattle with bovine encephalopathy [\"mad cow disease\"] had arisen in Britain and spread to Europe almost two decades ago.

Ancient Egyptian writings in the Kahun Papyri [1900 BC] acknowledged the recognition of animal diseases; and ancient Mesopotamians passed laws [Eshuna Code of 2300] for containment of rabid dogs [39] . The number of households or the proportion of families in the world with pets is unknown but this is quite substantial. In affluent countries pet ownership is increasing, not only for cats and dogs but also for more exotic animals. Companion animals can cause infectious diseases by several means of transmission such as by direct contact, bites scratches, incidentally by fecal-oral route, and indirectly by vectors, i.e., fleas, ticks, sandflies, and mosquitoes. Pet ownership rarely results in disease transmission overall, and most infections that result are usually asymptomatic or subclinical [e.g., toxoplasmosis from handling infected cat litter]. The majority of zoonoses reported from pets are related to dogs and cats, but there is a wide variety of animals and pathogens that can be involved such as reptiles/amphibians, birds, rodents, monkeys, and even pet-household pigs. The risk of infection of potential zoonoses depends on the animal, local zoonoses endemic in the region, hygienic practice, laws governing animal vaccinations and license, and restrictions of exotic animals in households. The major pet-associated zoonoses are shown in Tables 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. In most developed countries, pet-associated clinically recognized infections are usually secondary to accidental bites, scratches, or contact of open wounds with saliva of cats or dogs. Dog bites most commonly affect children, and in the US 4.7 million people a year suffer from dog bites, with 368,345 persons requiring emergency room treatment for dog-bite injuries [40] . Rabies, a fatal zoonosis transmitted by dog or cat bite, is rare in North America and most well-developed countries, and most cases occur in Africa and Asia with 55,000 deaths globally each year [41] . The majority of cases result from dog bites [99%] and most frequently from freeroaming animals. In North America rabies is mainly associated with bats in human cases. Animal rabies has declined in all domestic vertebrates in the US since 2010, with only 69 affected dogs but 303 infected cats, 63% of all domestic animals [42] .

The most important disease globally in this category is visceral leishmaniasis which is caused by Leishmania infantum [L. chagasi], transmitted by sandflies from the major reservoir of domestic dogs [39] . The disease is endemic in many countries of southern Europe, South and Central America, northern Africa, and Asia; and a high proportion of dogs in these areas are infected. It was estimated by the WHO in 2007 that about 12 million people were infected worldwide and 2 million new cases occurred annually; also there was increased risk of severe disease in the HIV-infected population [46] . Control of leishmaniasis in the endemic areas is a great challenge and extension to non-endemic regions is of great concern, due to increasing travel access of pets across borders. Control measures instituted in Brazil consisted of serologically testing dogs and culling positive animals [47] , and vaccination of dogs with a commercial vaccine [Leishmune] has resulted in decreased prevalence in canine and human leishmaniasis from reduced transmission [48] . Cat scratch disease is the most common zoonotic infection caused by Bartonella bacteria. It is of worldwide distribution but more common in temperate zones where pets are kept indoors. The cat although asymptomatic is a large reservoir for human infections with Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, and Bartonella koehlerae. Cat scratch disease occurs mainly in children and is transmitted by the infected flea feces via the claws of kittens from scratching. Thus it is a vector-borne infection transmitted from cats with bacteremia to other cats and humans by fleas. Dogs can be infected with various Bartonella species, but their role in human disease is unclear [49] . The infection is usually manifested by fever and regional lymphadenopathy, but rare severe complications can occur such as encephalitis, granulomatous hepatitis, retinitis, choroiditis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis [27] . In patients with AIDS, Bartonella henselae can rarely cause a rash of bacillary angiomatosis with secondary lesions in the liver [bacillary peliosis], spleen, and lymph nodes.

Infections in the pets as diagnosed by a veterinarian may be used as a sentinel for monitoring the risk of disease in the community of an endemic area [50] . Dog ticks can transmit rickettsia infection to humans, and dog ownership is a risk factor for acquiring rickettsiosis in endemic regions. Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF] is endemic in many states of the US, greatest in the mid-south Atlantic states and west south-central region than the Rocky Mountain States, but also present in Central America [Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama] and northern South America [Columbia and Brazil] [27, 51] . The main vector for RMSF is the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, in the Eastern US, but in the Western US, it is the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni. Only the adult ticks accidentally feed on humans, but all stages of the tick are infected and the organism is transmitted to the offspring transovarially [51] . The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is the vector for RMSF in Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, and Brazil [52, 53] . Field mice, other rodents in the wild, rabbits, and their ticks are the natural reservoir for R. Rickettsiae, and the dog is an incidental host. Mediterranean spotted fever [MSF], caused by Rickettsia conorii, is also transmitted by the brown dog tick from bites or from mucus membrane contact with crushed tick [53] . The endemic areas are found across southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Asia. Dogs are subclinically infected and are important biological hosts. The prevalence of MSF in dogs in endemic areas can be high, 26-60%, and the cycle of the rickettsia is maintained between rodents, ticks, and dogs, with humans as accidental hosts. The disease often starts with an eschar at the site of bite; then progresses to maculopapular, erythematous rash with fever; and usually lasts for about 10 days [27] .

There is concern that dog tapeworm disease [echinococcosis] is reemerging in some countries of Europe and that toxocariasis, from cat and dog roundworms, is still persisting in large endemic areas [56] . Echinococcosis is a cystic [hydatid] disease produced by tapeworms of canids and humans become accidentally infected by ingestion of fertile eggs or proglottids. Echinococcus granulosus causes cystic hydatid disease which is a global zoonosis transmitted within a dog-sheep cycle in sheep-rearing pastoral regions. Echinococcus multilocularis is a less common infection but produces a more invasive and aggressive disease, alveolar echinococcosis, and the red or arctic fox is the natural final host [36] . E. granulosus infection is fairly common in the Mediterranean basin and is reemerging in southern Europe endemic areas [57] . The sheep strain of E. granulosus prevalence in farm or shepherd dogs in Italy and Spain varies from 0% to 31%, in Lithuania 14.2%, and in Wales it increased from 0% in 1993 to 10.6% in 2008 [56] .

Many emerging zoonoses occur as a result of increasing exposures of domestic animals and humans to wildlife. Predicting the emergence of novel zoonoses will require tracking the general trends of emerging infectious diseases, analyzing the risk factors for their emergence, and examining the environmental changes that are influential [76] . Wolfe et al. [77] estimated that the three main factors that govern the emergence of new wildlife zoonoses are the diversity of wildlife pathogens in a region, the zoonotic pool; environmental changes that affect the presence of pathogens in the wildlife population; and the frequency of contacts of domestic animals and humans with wildlife harboring potential zoonoses. Emergence of a new infectious disease usually results from a change in ecology of the hosts or pathogens or both [76] .

This may have occurred in the US where new road construction caused dispersal of the white-footed mouse [Peromyscus leucopus] which is a reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi and resulted in expansion of Lyme disease to new areas [78] . Hunting of wildlife is an ancient tradition that increases the risk of exposure to multiple zoonotic pathogens. Hunting for bushmeat involves contact with potential infectious pathogens at several stages: tracking, capturing and handling the animals, then butchering and transporting the carcass, and trading and consumption of the meat. Moreover, there is increased exposure to potential infected vectors while hunting. Africa poses the greatest risk for emergence of novel wildlife zoonoses which may threaten the health of the global population, by adaptation and transmission from humans to humans. Bushmeat trade and consumption and demand in West and Central Africa appear to be highest in the world, four times greater than in the Amazon basin, with about 4.5 million tons of bushmeat marketed for consumption annually or >287 g per person per day [79, 80] . Furthermore, the practice of hunting primates for bushmeat is still a common practice in Africa, which is associated with a particular high risk for crossover infection to humans, especially chimpanzees which are phylogenetically the closest to humans [77] . This is commonly believed to be a major factor in the emergence of HIV and Ebola virus from Africa. Other factors driving the emergence of novel zoonoses from Africa may include the ecologically diverse wildlife in large areas of tropical rainforests, new and changing patterns of land utilization, and the increased demand for bushmeat in urban communities [77] . The reverse pattern of transmission of domestic animal pathogens to wildlife to maintain a large natural reservoir of zoonoses is also possible, but transmission to humans would still be more likely to occur from contact with domestic livestock. Table 2 .7 shows some of the major zoonoses associated with wildlife.
