Whether the whole lung can be covered within one breath-hold with 1 mm collimation width depends on the speed of data acquisition. While a four-slice CT scanner still needed more than 25 s to cover a chest length of 30 cm, a 16-slice scanner provided already the technical base to cover the thorax (30 cm length) in less than 15 s when a table feed of 1.5 mm was used. A 64-slice scanner allowed for a scan time below 10 s. The most modern scanners (128-slice scanners and beyond) allow for coverage of the chest in less than 3 s while acquiring data with isotropic submillimeter resolution. Thus, speed of data acquisition within one breath-hold does not represent a limitation anymore.",

            "text": "The ability of HRCT to provide high morphological detail of normal and abnormal lung parenchyma is based on high-quality examinations. With optimal scan technique, the spatial resolution is as low as 0.5 mm. Due to the high contrast within the lung parenchyma, even structures as small as 0.2 mm can be visualized (Murata et al. 1989 ). Thus, pulmonary artery branches down to the 16th and bronchi down to the 8th generation can be depicted. Since partial volume averaging effects on the margins of such small structures are minimized, HRCT provides a very accurate image of their true size. This represents the base for CT-based quantifi cation, e.g., of bronchial wall thickness and airway lumen in COPD patients. Since this high resolution is available isotropically, meaning in all three directions, diameters of vessels, lung nodules, or obliquely oriented bronchi are accurately refl ected, irrespective of their location in or near the scan plane or even perpendicular to the scan plane (Fig. 2 ) . Isotropic resolution in all three dimensions allows for axial, coronal, and sagittal reconstructions with equally high detail resolution. While pattern analysis is done on axial slices, the multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) nicely demonstrate the subpleural and craniocaudal distribution of disease in this patient with systemic sclerosis Spatial resolution is increased by the application of a high-spatial-frequency reconstruction algorithm (Mayo et al. 1987 ) . Standard algorithms lead to smoothening of the image in respect that visible image noise is reduced and contrast resolution increased. Sharp, high-spatialfrequency, or high-resolution algorithms, on the other hand, reduce image smoothening and increase spatial resolution. Anatomic margins and tissue interfaces, such as the fi ssure, pleura, or septa, appear sharper. Small vessels and bronchi are seen superiorly compared to a standard algorithm.",

However, with this approach, the spatial resolution will be limited by the intrinsic resolution of the detectors and whether it will gain diagnostic information will largely depend on personal preferences. There is no literature reference that generally recommends this approach, not even for certain indications.

Since 1 mm thin sections need to have a certain signal-to-noise level to provide acceptable diagnostic image quality, it was inevitable that volumetric data acquisition would deliver a higher dose to the patient. 3D dose modulation -automatically adapting the delivered dose in the transverse plane ( xyaxis) and along patient length ( z -axis) -is an effective means to reduce dose by about 30 % and is strongly recommended (Kubo et al. 2014 ) ( Table 1 ). The abovementioned survey in 2013 confi rmed that 90 % of the respondents indeed apply it. Additional options are to adapt the protocol to patient weight, patient age, or scan indication. Principally a tube voltage of 120 kV is recommended, but in young patients or patients of lower body weight, a tube voltage of 100 kV can be applied, further contributing to dose saving. The tube current is mostly set around 100 mAs. Ultimately a dose between 1.5 and 4 mSv should be aimed for (Fig. 3 ).",

            "text": "There is a multitude of publications evaluating low-dose protocols (40-60 mAs), most of them for the detection of nodules or within a screening setting. Those results cannot be directly transferred to the diagnostic workup of DILD, in which detection of ground-glass opacities and fi ne septal thickenings is required. Christe A et al. systematically evaluated the effi ciency of a low-dose protocol for the detection of common patterns of pulmonary diseases evaluating 1 mm slices, reconstructed with fi ltered back projection (FBP) and a high reconstruction kernel. They concluded that a 120 kVp/40 mAs protocol was feasible for detecting solid nodules, air space consolidations, and airway and pleural diseases; however, pathologies consisting of ground-glass opacities and interstitial opacities required higher tube current or iterative noise reconstruction (Christe et al. 2013 ) . New iterative reconstruction algorithms (IR) allow for greater noise reduction than standard fi ltered back projection (FBP) and subsequently more effective dose reduction. While increased spatial resolution is directly correlated with increase of image noise in standard fi ltered back projection, iterative reconstruction allows for decoupling of spatial resolution and image noise to a certain extent. Once an image has been reconstructed from measured projections, this image itself is used as \"scan object\" in a simulated CT measurement of the same projection, resulting in an image of calculated projections. The differences between the measured and calculated projections result in correction projections which are subsequently used to update the originally measured projections. This process is repeated until the difference between the calculated projections and measured projections is smaller than a predefi ned limit. With each update to the original image, image-processing algorithms enhance spatial resolution in higher contrast areas of the image and reduce noise in low contrast areas. While the fi rst generations of IR produced images of lower noise, they were criticized for modifying the visual appearance of images, either being smoothed or pixelated especially with increased weighting of iterative noise reconstruction (Pontana et al. 2011 ; Prakash et al. 2010 ) (Fig. 4 ) . The second generation of socalled model-based IR -active in the raw data space -aims for reducing noise and maintaining image sharpness, thus having less impact on the visual image impression.",

The rationale behind this is the potential value of air trapping for the differential diagnosis that can be appreciated on an expiratory scan, even in the absence of inspiratory scan abnormalities and the fact that the functional cause of respiratory disability is not always known, especially during the initial diagnostic phase. Within the context of management of interstitial lung disease, the British Thoracic Society suggest that after a diagnosis has been set, additional expiratory CT acquisitions should only be performed to evaluate inconclusive fi ndings on inspiratory CT. Because of dose considerations, most investigators obtain some expiratory scans on predetermined levels or discontinuous clusters (Prosch et al. 2013 ). There are various ways how to plan these scans: either in areas of pathology seen in inspiration or on specifi c predefi ned levels following anatomic landmarks (e.g., carina, aortic arch) in order to facilitate reproducibility in follow-up scans. How many levels need to be covered is unclear and ranges from 2 to 5. Alternatively also the expiratory scan can be obtained with volumetric data acquisition. It has the advantage of decreasing the risk of motion artifacts frequently seen in discontinuous expiratory scans, allows for quantifi cation on a 3D basis, and allows for more precise, levelmatched follow-up. Since the only purpose of these scans is the detection, localization, and quantifi cation of air trapping, these scans can be obtained with a drastically reduced dose. Multiple studies have shown that tube current levels as low as 40 mAs are suffi cient for the diagnostic purpose intended. Bankier et al. carried out a systematic comparison of expiratory CT scans obtained with 120 kV, 80 mAs, and simulated 60, 40, and 20 mAs scans and found that -though diagnostic confi dence went down with decreasing acquisition dose and interreader variability went up -diagnostic accuracy was not affected (Bankier et al. 2007 ) .

Dynamic scans were fi rstly introduced using an electron beam CT; however, it can also be performed with any MDCT scanner with a gantry rotation time of 1 s or less. Because images can be reconstructed at any time point during the scan, the temporal resolution is even higher than with the electron beam CT. Mostly continuous imaging is performed on a single axial level for 6-8 s as the patient expires rapidly. Acquisition dose is drastically reduced (usually 40 mAs). Lucidarme et al.

Firstly, the disease extent was differentiated into minimal or severe (less or more than 20 % involved lung area). For the subgroup of patients in which the disease extent was not readily classifi able on HRCT (so-called indeterminate), the distinction between limited and extensive was based on FVC threshold values below or beyond 70 % predicted (FVC = forced expiratory vital capacity).

            "text": "There has been an increasing interest for the use of automatic CT quantifi cation as imaging biomarker to document disease response to treatment, disease progression, and eventually prognosis. Such a biomarker should be measurable but also reproducible and linked to relevant clinical outcome parameters (Goldin 2013 ) . To meet the fi rst two demands, rigorous standardization of imaging protocols over several sites and time points is needed, including centralized scanner and image quality checks. The underlying technique of automatic, texture analysis-based CT quantifi cation is beyond the scope of this book chapter. There has been a number of studies evaluating the use of a computer-derived quantitative lung fi brosis score (QLF) for assessment of baseline disease extent and changes over time in patients with IPF (Kim 2015 ) and scleroderma patients treated with cyclophosphamide (Kim 2011 ) . While this algorithm focuses solely on fi brotic changes, a different approach is used by the so-called CALIPER software (computer-aided lung informatics for pathology evaluation and rating), which associates a certain group of neighboring voxels to one of the basic patterns (normal, emphysema, ground glass, honeycombing, and reticular) for the complete lung volume (Bartholmai 2013 ) . A recently published position paper by the Fleischner society (Hansell et al. 2015 ) acknowledges that CT has not only the potential to select the most appropriate patients to be included in treatment trials but also to represent a study end point in conjunction with other markers. This recent development has been fueled by the increasing precision with which image-processing software can quantify diffuse lung diseases.",

Most recent developments of detector and reconstruction technology have made up for the disadvantage of continuous versus discontinuous data acquisition of the past, allowing for substantial dose savings. All these arguments have led to the fact that HRCT is routinely based on volumetric data acquisition. Today basically each chest CT offers the spatial resolution of a HRCT in all three dimensions, and it depends on the indication of the examination (e.g., malignancy versus diffuse parenchymal disease) whether contrast media is injected and which slice thickness and reconstruction techniques (e.g., MIP and MinIP) are applied.",
