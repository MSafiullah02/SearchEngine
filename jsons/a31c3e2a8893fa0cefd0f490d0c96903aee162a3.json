Two models developed in the early phases were discarded when they lost statistical validity, The third, current, model is a 3 rd -degree polynomial that has remained stable over the last 30 days (since Apr 8), with R 2 > 0.998 consistently. This model is used to forecast Total Covid cases, after cautionary discussion of triggers that would invalidate the model. The purpose of all forecasts in the study is to provide a comparator to evaluate policy initiatives to control the pandemic -the forecasts are not objectives by themselves. Actual observations less than forecasts mean successful policy interventions. Figures of Doubling Time, Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate used by authorities are questioned. Elongation of doubling rates is inherent in the model, and worthy of mention only when the time actually exceeds what the model predicts. The popular Fatality Rate and Recovery Rate metrics are shown to be illogical.",

It is known that the effects of such events show up in observed Total Cases with a lag of 1 to 2 weeks. The change in the nature of progression should show up in the output of the mathematical model as well. This does not happen automatically -what happens is that estimates thrown-up by the model begin deviating significantly from observed data. This is the signal that the underlying pattern has changed, and so the model must be revised to reflect the new underlying pattern. Thus, over the life of this pandemic, we expect to see different models in different phases, as the real-life nature of progression changes.",

For the graph remaining unchanged, the current doubling time of 12 days, would automatically increase to 16 days by the end of May, and to 19 days by mid-June. This reiterates one of the most important arguments of this studythat a mathematical model is a comparator, and successes occur only when the outcomes are lower than forecasts by the model.

Based on the stability of the model, while elaborating the events that would cause the model to change, the study has extrapolated Total Cases, Total Deaths and Active cases till Sept 15 th . In doing so, the study has argued that the current publicly-reported Fatality and Recovery Rates are flawed, and derived more realistic estimates of these parameters. The forecasted numbers provide a basis for comparison with the results of planned policy interventions -if the actual observed data is less than the forecasts, we are doing well. This is the more important reason to use the forecasts, rather than as astrological predictions of the shape of things to come! While exploring the number of Active Cases forecasted by the model, the study has found that Indian healthcare infrastructure has the capacity to deal with number of cases projected, more or less. In that sense, the Indian curve is flat enough. However, the current curve of Covid19 cases is NOT flat enough with respect to expected fatalities, which by the current growth curve would reach 100,000 by Sept 15 th . The study set an arbitrary limit of 50000 Total Deaths by Sep 15, and retro-fitted a mathematical model that was acceptably flat. The key parameters of this desired curve -Total Cases, Total Deaths and Active Cases -have been tabulated fortnightly, as also done for the current model.",
