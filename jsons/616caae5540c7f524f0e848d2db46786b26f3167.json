Unexpectedly, we found 25 that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I/III IFN 26 treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan/NTU01/2020 isolate. The 27 type I/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 28 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute 29 neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum 30 could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the 31 interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may 32 provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the major receptor for virus entry 3-5 .

Two SARS-CoV-2-infected patients admitted to our unit showed distinct clinical 62 virology and serology progresses (Table 1) . Both patients showed normal complete blood 63 count (CBC) initially with mild thrombocytopenia. Although days taken for seroconversion 64 highly varied between the two patients, the immunoglobulin levels including total IgM, IgG 65 and IgA were comparable (Table 1) (Table 1) 15 . Therefore, it is likely that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 innate immunity was not 69 sufficiently induced in time to confront SARS-CoV-2 infections in Patient NTU1. We then 70 isolated viruses from both patients, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 (GeneBank: 71 MT066175.1) and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 (GeneBank: MT066176.1), and 72 assessed how these isolates may induce and response to host innate immunity in cell cultures. 73 We then performed many assays in cell culture, where only the innate immunity of the 74 infected host cells are involved, to rule out the variations among infected individuals and to 75 characterize the virology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RNA sequencing results determined that 76 SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 represented clade B with the L84S (28144T>C) 77 polymorphism in ORF8, and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 was highly related to 78 the Wuhan prototype strain (Table 2) . We hypothesize that the induction levels of type I and 79 type III IFNs may be low during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this may be due to the lack of 80 PRR recognition and/or a strong suppression of type I/III IFN expressions by the viral 81 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. To address these questions, we utilized two of our clinical isolates 82 4 of SARS-CoV-2 to infect Huh7, A549, and Calu3 cells, and monitored their inductions and 83 responses to type I/III interferons during SARS-CoV-2 infections. 84 We first monitored the intracellular vRNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 hepatoma cells, infected Huh7 cells (Fig 1A) . For both isolates, the vRNA levels was higher at 24 h.p.i than 94 those at 48 h.p.i, suggesting that the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 is none or very 95 minimal (Fig. 1A) . Also, NTU1 and NTU2 showed comparable intracellular vRNA levels in 96 the infected Huh7 cells (Fig. 1A) . Compared to the wildtype Huh7 cells, we did not observe 97 any significant differences at the intracellular vRNA levels in the SARS-CoV-2 infected 98 MAVS K/D huh7 cells (Fig. 1B) . The loss of MAVS-dependent antiviral innate immunity did 99 not further support replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that the ",

The detail mechanism remained to 229 be further studied. (Table 1) , was able to effectively neutralize NTU1 246 virions at >1:160 dilution in the PRNT assay ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . However, both serum 247 collected from Patient NTU1 before and after seroconversion did not well-neutralize the 248 virion isolated from the same patient (NTU1) The PRNT50 for NTU1 is about 1:80 before 249 seroconversion and 1:160 after seroconversion (Fig. 4) . These results together indicated that 250 although the total IgM, IgG, and IgA amount between both patients were at the comparable 251 or ever higher levels (Table 1) (Fig 3, E-F) . Intriguingly, a recent report showed that among the top 50 genes 273 which were co-expressed with ACE2, an entry receptor for SARS-CoV2, many of them were 274 ISGs or genes that are involved in the regulation innate immunity, including ASS1, OAS1, 275 MX1, and etc. 22 . In our study, we found that pretreatment of TBK1 inhibitor prior go SARS- Fig. 3B and Fig. 1B) . We examined the mRNA levels of ACE2 in our 279 samples and found that the expression of ACE2 was increased after of IFN\u03b2 and/or IFN\u03bb1 report showed that ACE2 may be an ISG in human epithelial cells 23 . Our study together with 284 recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize certain ISGs to benefit its own life cycle.",

Conversely, although the 141 intracellular levels of SARS-CoV-2 vRNA were readily amplified at 24 h.p.i, the induction of 142 IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 mRNA expressions in Calu-3 remained undetectable at 24 h.p.i (Fig. 2, B & 143 D), indicating either that the intracellular vRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 are poor ligands for RNA 144 recognition by the PRRs to induce type I/III IFNs or certain viral products of SARS-CoV2 145 could strongly suppress the induction of antiviral innate immunity.

Nevertheless, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, 149 the attitude of the induction of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 mRNA expression was not correlated to the 150 intracellular vRNA levels. The initial induction of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 mRNA expression was 151 weak at 24 h.p.i during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2, D and E) At 48 hours post SARS-152 CoV-2 infection, along with the elevated amount of intracellular vRNA (Fig. 2B), both the 153 mRNA levels of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 were drastically increased, 154and the expressions of ISGs, including IFIT and IFITM3 were also elevated(Fig. 2D). As 155 previously mentioned that the expression of IFITM3 is under the control of ISRE, these 156 results suggested that in Calu-3 cells, the production of type I/III IFNs was not impaired during SARS-CoV-2 infection(Fig. 2D).

We 171 then assessed whether the intracellular vRNA of SARS-CoV-2 could serve as the ligands of 172 the cytoplasmic foreign RNA receptors, RIG-I and MDA5. Total RNA extracted from the 173 NTU-1-or NTU-2-infected Calu-3 cells were transfected into mouse embryonic fibroblasts 174 (MEFs) treated with cycloheximide to monitor their abilities to induce type I IFN expression 175 by measuring the mRNA levels of Ifnb in the absence of any newly-translated proteins (Fig. 176 3B). As negative and positive controls, total Calu-3 intracellular from mock-infected 177 (mcRNA) or Sendai virus-infected (SenV-icRNA) cells were also transfected into MEFs 178 respectively (Fig. 3B). The transfection of mcRNA into MEFs did not induce any expression 179 of Ifnb in MEFs. The Ifnb mRNA levels were greatly increased in MEFs transfected with 180 total intracellular RNA harvested from SenV-infected cells (Fig. 3B). We then pretreated the 181 SenV-icRNA samples with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase prior to transfection to reduce 182 8 RIG-I recognition of SenV-icRNA, and as expected, the Ifnb mRNA levels induced by CIP-183 treated SenV-icRNA transfection was drastically reduced (Fig. 3B). We found that MEFs 184 transfected with the total RNAs extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (NTU1-185 and NTU2-icRNAs) were able to induce slight expression of Ifnb mRNA when compared to 186 that transfected with SenV-icRNA (Fig. 3B), and the phosphatase pretreatment of the total 187 RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells prior to RNA transfection could barely 188 reduce the induction of Ifnb mRNA, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be 189 recognized mostly through PRRs other than RIG-I (Fig. 3B).190 Based on these results, it is suggested that although the replication intermediates of 191 SARS-CoV-2 is an inducer for type I IFN expression, SARS-CoV-2 may encode some viral 192 products as strong type I IFN induction suppressors, which together contribute the poor 193 induction of type I/III IFNs (Figs. 2D and 3B). Therefore, we next assessed whether the 194 complementarity by exogenous source of type I or type III IFNs in the culture medium may 195 facilitate the cells to establish the antiviral states to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication. Huh7 196 and Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolates at the indicated m.o.i. for 24 hours 197 and then treated with either 100 IU/mL of IFN\u03b2 or 100 ng/ mL of IFN\u03bb1 for 24 hours. The 198 intracellular RNA from these cells were then extracted by trizol and reverse-transcribed into 199 cDNA for quantitative PCR. The mRNA levels of several ISGs, including IFIT1 and IFITM3, 200 were first determined to validate that the treatment of IFN\u03b2 and/or IFN\u03bb1 indeed turned on 201 the expression of ISGs (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of ISGs post-interferon treatments 202were at comparable levels among the mock-, NTU1-, and NTU2-infected cells, suggesting 203 that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not block the response to type I IFN in Huh7 cells(Fig. 3C).204In Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce the expression of type I/III expression at 205 48 h.p.i.(Fig. 2D), and responses to both type I and type III IFN post-treatments during 206 SARS-CoV-2 further elevated the mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 and IFITM3(Fig. 3D).",

Calu-3 cells pretreated with type I and/or type III IFNs were also able to 211 restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication (Supplementary Fig. 3A). However, in all cells which were 212 post-treated with either type I and/or type III IFNs after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we did not 213 observe any antiviral effects in these cells as the vRNA levels sustained after the treatment of 214 type I/III IFNs(Fig. 3E). The vRNA levels of NTU2 remained unchanged upon type I IFN 215 treatment in Huh7 and A549 cells(Fig. 3E), but however, the vRNA levels of NTU1 were 216 predominantly enhanced after the treatment of type I IFN(Fig. 3E).
