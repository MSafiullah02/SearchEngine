The concept of nuclear families in recent decades already threatens the mental well-being of children, where parental duties in hospitals and subsequent quarantine of their parents make them feel deserted. Although doctors know that children are probably the least physically affected group, a fear of transmitting the virus to their children is lurking in their minds which may prevent them from interacting with their children.2 Children of less than 3 years of age who are dependent on their mothers for breast milk and other activities of daily living pass their lives in torment. Although, as a positive effect of lockdown, most children are getting more time to mingle with their parents, the story of children of frontline COVID-19 warriors is different.3 Young children may not understand why their parents are not returning. Older children and adolescents with more mature thinking may offer respect towards their parents for being involved in the fight against the deadly COVID-19. Incidences of eviction from homes or discrimination against their medical professional parents4 will create a sense of insecurity, fear, and vulnerability among children\u2014this may lead to long term consequences of anger, aggressiveness and disrespect towards society at large.",
