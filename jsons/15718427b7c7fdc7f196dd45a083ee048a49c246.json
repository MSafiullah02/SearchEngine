Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza type 11, and coronaviruses were the most common identified pathogens. Minor and colleagues 27 found in a population of older asthmatics a similar occurrence of wheezing during acute viral illness. Rhinovirus of several different scrotypes and influenza A were temporally associated with wheezing in this study. Henderson and coworkers 14 in a study of a general practice population showed that age and time of year were important variables in the occurrence of wheezing associated with respiratory infection. RSV was the predominant organism in infants and toddlers with a persistent but decreasing importance in older children. Rhinovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were of increasing frequency in school-age children. There was a seasonal peak of wheezing with RSV in the mid-winter months in children less than 2 years of age and in October and November with M. pneumoniae in children over 5. The fall epidemic of wheezing in older children is significant in that it coincides with reports of peak admissions and emergency room visits for asthma noted during these months. 3 These data demonstrate that wheezing associated with respiratory infection occurs in all pediatric populations, regardless of whether severe hospitalized asthmatic children or children from a general practice are studied. Data suggesting that increased airway reactivity occur in adult individuals during viral respiratory infections, both \"normal\" adult as well as those with asthma and/or a history of atopy, will be reviewed below. No correlation has been found between the occurrence of wheezing and acute bacterial infections in either adult or pediatric populations.14. 18.27 A question that frequently arises is whether the association between wheezing and acute respiratory illness might be explained by the fact that people with recurrent wheezing or asthma are more prone to infection. Minor and investigators 26 reported that individuals who had histories of wheezing demonstrated an increased incidence of viral infection when compared to their nonwheezing siblings. This increased rate of infection was related exclusively to the recovery of rhinoviruses. Tarlo and co-workers36 in a study of asthmatics and their nonwheezing spouses found an increased number of symptomatic colds in the asthmatic population but a higher viral isolation rate and increased serological changes in the nonasthmatic spouses. Stempel and colleagues 34 found that the infection rate was the same for both the wheezing and nonwheezing population. The data of the latter two studies suggest that the incidence of infection may not be significantly different in individuals with a history of wheezing compared to those without.",

            "text": "Airway flow resistance is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fourth power. It has been suggested that the enhanced response to chemical agonists reflects the relatively large contribution of small but critical challenges in airway caliber induced by the noxious insult-e.g., viral infection. 33 Whether the reduction in airway diameter is a function of increased bronchomotor tone or intraluminal mucus and cellular debris is unclear and may vary with the insult. Virus infection conceivably may reduce cross-sectional diameter by either mechanism. For example, several lines of evidence suggest that the airway lumen, particularly in the smaller airways, may become occluded during or as a consequence of viral infections. First, histopathologic studies of virus infections in humans have shown extensive cytopathic changes in airway epithelium resulting in desquamation of the damaged and destroyed epithelial cells into the airway lumen. 24 Second, epithelial cell damage results in a loss of functioning ciliated cells, perhaps contributing to decreased clearance ofintraluminal products. 29 \u2022 38 Finally, the depth of the so-called \"sol\" layer, the liquid layer in which the cilia beat, appears important in the regulation of mucociliary clearance rates. 21 The volume and composition of the layer is regulated by active ion transport mechanisms located in airway epithelium. Although the nature of the transport mechanism varies among species and within airway regions in the lung, it appears that in the major bronchi sodium chloride and water are absorbed across the airway wall and that an intact epithelium is necessary for normal maintenance of this function. 6 Destruction of the epithelium barrier by virus agent would limit the generation of micro-osmolar gradients across this barrier that promote liquid absorption, raising intraluminal liquid volume, and depressing mucociliary clearance rates.",

For example, direct recordings of vagal afferent activity from dogs has shown that cholinergic agents, in contrast to histamine, do not induce irritant receptor activity. Since methacholine has been one of the traditional chemical agonists employed to demonstrate enhanced airway constriction in virus-infected individuals, it appears likely that this agonist must be working by other mechanisms than stimulating sensitized vagal afferent fibers. In addition, respiratory viruses have not demonstrated a tropism for neural structures in vivo or in vitro, nor have immunofluorescent studies shown virus antigens in regions of neural afferent receptors. 32 However, indirect effects on neural afferents induced by soluble mediators released in response to virus infection cannot be ruled out without more direct neurophysiological data.",

I6 Respiratory viruses demonstrate a tropism for epithelial cells and produce cellular damage and destruction. Recent studies by Richardson et al. 32 have shown that movement of large molecules across the epithelial barrier is greatly increased consequent to a virus-enhanced disruption of the epithelium. In addition, these studies showed with ultrastructural techniques that afferent neural fibers in the epithelium appeared to be intact at the peak of virus infection but directly exposed to the airway lumen. Therefore, because of this finding, it appears possible that enhanced airway reactivity associated with virus infection, as demonstrated by inhaled histamine or methacholine challenge, may reflect the increased flow of these agonists across the airway mucosal surface to exposed vagal afferents and/or smooth muscle.",

In addition, the lack of specificity of pharmacologic agents as well as experimental limitations hinders the interpretation of data obtained from studies of human subjects with respect to this or other hypotheses.

Frick and co-workers l have specifically suggested that virus infections trigger the manifestations of atopy. They studied a group of children with strong family histories of atopy. They looked for the development of IgE antibody before, during, and after documented virus infection. They noted that upper respiratory infections occurred in most of these children one to two months prior to the onset of allergic sensitization. Although the normal incidence of viral infection in children may account for this association, this observation generates speculation as the role of infection in subsequent allergic sensitization.",

            "text": "As noted above, Richardson and colleagues demonstrated severe disruption of airway epithelium in a chicken model in response to an infection with an avian virus. 32 Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a marker of protein permeability, they demonstrated an increased How of HRP across airway surfaces after either virus infection or challenge with a chemical irritant (methacholine) as compared to control. Circulating anti-HRP titers over a 20-day interval were measured in all three groups. Enhanced anti-HRP production as compared to control was associated with the increased HRP entry induced by methacholine exposure. However, the relatively larger increase in rate of HRP entry into plasma associated with the virus infection was associated with depressed anti-HRP titers. Therefore, whereas a viral infection in this model appears to depress circulating antibody response to an exogenous antigen, the relevance of these observations to virus-induced development of allergy in human subjects remains unclear. Repeat studies in a mammalian species, measurements of homocytrophic antibody responses, and antibody responses over longer time int~rvals will be required to more fully explore this relationship.",

Acute virus infections cause wheezing illnesses in both children and adults. Changes in peripheral airway function during infection with similar organisms are observed in other subjects, usually normal adults. The pathogenesis of these responses is unclear. Pathologic data do show that infection with these pathogens damages the airway epithelium. These changes appear to increase permeability of the respiratory epithelium to protein antigens and consequently may contribute to increased frequency of attacks in asthmatic subjects. In addition, increased mucosal permeability may enhance delivery of inhaled drugs to effector sites in airway walls to induce exaggerated bronchoconstrictor responses in clinical challenge situations. Whether changes in the epithelium during infection, inducing greater antigen entry into the interstitium, results in subsequent development of specific allergy is not known and requires further-study.",
