            "text": "The global emergency of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV features a large positive-stranded RNA genome that harbors open-reading frames (ORFs) encoding a large polyprotein required for virus replication, four structural proteins (spike, S; envelop, E; membrane, M; and nucleocapsid, N), and eight additional polypeptides of unknown function (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). SARS-CoV infection can trigger humoral and cellular immune responses against viral proteins in humans. The high rate of recovery from acute illness of SARS in the absence of effective medical therapy and the low rate of re-infection by SARS-CoV suggest that protective immunity is achievable. Recent studies have demonstrated that sera from convalescent-phase SARS patients contain high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV (Nie et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004). The S protein of SARS-CoV, like those of other coronaviruses, has been shown to be a major antigenic determinant that induces neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity (Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). A DNA vaccine encoding the S protein induced SARS-CoV neutralization and protective immunity in mice (Yang et al., 2004). Depletion of T cells and antibody transfer experiments revealed that protection was mediated by neutralizing antibodies (Subbarao et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004), and protection can be achieved by sole administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for S protein (Traggiai et al., 2004). Furthermore, vaccination of animals with recombinant viruses, such as attenuated vaccinia virus (MVA) and parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3), that express S protein can elicit neutralizing antibodies to protect animals against SARS-CoV challenge (Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004). Infection by pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV S protein can be effectively neutralized by convalescent sera from SARS patients (Nie et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004). These data suggest that the S protein of SARS-CoV is a promising candidate for developing SARS vaccines.",

A 193-amino acid small fragment (residues 318\u2013510) in the S1 region was characterized as the minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). RBD mediates S protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV on susceptible cells (Dimitrov, 2003, Li et al., 2003, Prabakaran et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2004). Most recently, we demonstrated that the recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV S protein could induce potent neutralizing antibodies (He et al., 2004a, He et al., 2004b). In this report, we showed that the RBD of S protein is a critical neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV in SARS patients and SARS-CoV-immunized rabbits. We further identified two neutralization epitopes in the RBD by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV.",

All the sera were positive for SARS-CoV as detected by ELISA with commercially available diagnostic kits, in which the mixture of proteins purified from viral lysates of SARS-CoV was used as coating antigen (data not shown). To determine antibodies specific for the RBD of S protein in the SARS convalescent sera, we used recombinant RBD-C9 as a coating antigen in ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1\n, all of the 40 convalescent sera from SARS patients reacted significantly with RBD-C9, whereas none of the sera from healthy blood donors was reactive to this antigen, suggesting that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein is highly immunogenic during virus infection.",

The efficiencies of depletion and recovery of the RBD-specific antibodies were monitored by measuring the reactivity of the starting human sera, the corresponding flowthroughs, and eluted antibody fractions by ELISA against the RBD-C9 and S1-C9. As shown in Fig. 2A, the reactivity of anti-RBD in the sera of SARS patients was efficiently removed by RBD-Fc affinity column. The eluted anti-RBD antibodies could significantly react with RBD-C9. All samples corresponding to the starting sera, flowthroughs (anti-RBD depleted), and eluates (anti-RBD antibodies) were reactive to the S1-C9 in ELISA (Fig. 2B).

It is interesting to know whether the RBD of S protein can mediate antibody responses responsible for virus neutralization in infected SARS patients. Therefore, the neutralizing activity of the samples of the starting sera, flowthroughs, and eluates was determined using SARS pseudovirus. Strikingly, the neutralizing activity of patient sera was significantly reduced after depletion of anti-RBD antibodies. The anti-RBD antibodies in the eluates possessed higher potency than the antibodies in the flowthroughs to neutralize SARS pseudovirus (Fig. 3\nand Table 1\n), suggesting that more than 50% neutralizing activity in the convalescent sera of SARS patients was contributed by the RBD-specific antibodies. In contrast, the serum samples including the starting sera, flowthroughs, and eluates from the healthy blood donor had no neutralizing activities to same pseudovirus (data not shown).

However, none of these domains modeled by linear peptides were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies (He et al., 2004c).

However, caution should be taken in using the inactivated SARS-CoV as vaccine since it contains a number of viral components that may induce harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses (Enserink, 2004, He et al., 2004c, Oba, 2003, Wang and Lu, 2004). It was recently reported that an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine triggered an autoimmune response against the carbohydrate moieties in an abundant human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid (Wang et al., 2004). Recombinant viruses or DNA vaccines that express full-length S protein have also been considered as SARS vaccine candidates (Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). However, the full-length S protein also contains several linear immunodominant domains that induce a high titer of non-neutralizing antibodies (He et al., 2004c). It is unclear whether or not these non-neutralizing antibodies may enhance SARS-CoV infection or mediate harmful immune responses. It was reported that vaccination of ferrets with vaccinia virus-based SARS vaccine expressing full-length S protein aggravated liver damage caused by SARS-CoV infection (Enserink, 2004, Weingartl et al., 2004). It has been demonstrated that the S protein of feline coronavirus (FIPV) expressed by recombinant vaccinia can cause antibody-dependant enhancement of disease if the vaccinated animals are subsequently infected with wild-type virus (Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1993, Vennema et al., 1990).",
