Success stories include acyclovir and its prodrug for herpes simplex virus (HSV), two neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza, five antiviral drugs for hepatitis B (HBV), and almost two-dozen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs. Despite these significant advances, however, many common viral infections still do not have safe and effective treatments. For example, there are no antiviral drugs for either the Dengue virus, which causes 50\u2013100 million cases of Dengue fever a year (Morens and Fauci, 2008), or the oncogenic human papillomaviruses, which cause cervical cancer and have a prevalence of 26.8% in U.S. women (Dunne et al., 2007).",

The drawback to this approach is that, unless viruses are closely related, separate drug discovery and development efforts are required for each virus. In some cases, multiple inhibitors are needed in combination to combat the rapid development of resistance. This is clearly the case with HIV, and it is expected to be the case with hepatitis C (HCV) (Grunberger et al., 2008). Inhibiting pathogen targets still has great value and will clearly continue to yield beneficial new drugs, but use of host targets in antiviral therapy is growing. For example, one of the newest classes of HIV inhibitors, the CCR5 antagonists, targets the cell surface receptors and blocks entry of the virus (Schlect et al., 2008).",

This is particularly attractive for emerging infections, such as the 2002\u20132003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. In such cases, a broad-spectrum agent could allow for effective treatment without the lead time necessary to develop a virus-specific therapy. A broad-spectrum inhibitor would also be welcome in the treatment of niche indications, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by uncontrolled JC virus infection in the central nervous system of immune-compromised patients. In such cases, medical need is acute, but the patient population is not large enough to provide an economic incentive for development of a virus-specific drug.",

The median effect concentration (K) was 7.5 nM and the maximum inhibition (I\nmax) was 88%. In this case interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that growth of the host Vero cells is also inhibited with a similar median effect concentration (K) of 12 nM. The maximum inhibition of cell growth (I\nmax), however, was only 37%, which is significantly lower than that for viral replication. The difference in I\nmax values between the antiviral and growth effects suggests that GSK983 has an antiviral effect distinct from the effect on cell growth. To address this issue, we calculated the ratio of SV40 DNA to MTS activity of the infected Vero cells. This ratio is proportional to viral DNA per cell and as seen in Fig. 3, falls with increasing GSK983 concentration. The median effect concentration (K) for reduction of the ratio is 12 \u00b1 2 nM, and the maximum inhibition (I\nmax) is 79 \u00b1 2%. This result suggests that GSK983 does reduce SV40 replication, but because of the different forms of the dose\u2013response curves for inhibition of the viral yield and inhibition of growth of the host Vero cells we are unable to calculate a selectivity index. There was no system available to study SV40 infection of primary cells, limiting our ability to calculate a true selectivity index.",

The median effect concentration determined using the hybrid capture assay is 5 nM, the maximum inhibition (I\nmax) of HPV levels by GSK983 is greater than 95% of the control, and the I\nmax value is reached at concentrations below 100 nM (Fig. 5\nand Table 3\n). As in the case of the Vero cells above, however, GSK983 has effects on the growth of the W12 cells. The K values for the compound's effects on viral DNA and growth are similar, but there is a difference in the I\nmax values (Table 3). In the case of W12 growth inhibition, I\nmax does not approach 100%, but rather is asymptotic at 60% of control. When the ratio of HPV DNA to MTS activity is calculated, the resulting dose\u2013response curve is not significantly different from that for inhibition of total HPV DNA (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Since this ratio is proportional to viral DNA copy number per cell, it suggests GSK983 reduces HPV viral copy number independent of the effect on the W12 cells\u2019 functioning. The reduction in copy number was confirmed by measurement of HPV and cellular actin DNA by quantitative PCR (Table 3). Similar values of K were observed, and the I\nmax values were only slightly lower. Calculation of gene numbers from these data showed that at 100 nM GSK983, the copy number, expressed as HPV genomes per actin gene, was reduced from 460 to 150.",

None of the primary cell types tested was significantly inhibited by GSK983 at concentrations below 1 \u03bcM, and 50% inhibition was seen in the range of 10\u2013100 \u03bcM. Unlike the viral assays, in which GSK983 was clearly more potent than its enantiomer GSK984, in the primary cells, similar CC50 values were observed for both enantiomers (data not shown).

These results indicate induction of cytostasis by GSK983, consistent with the asymptotic dose\u2013response curves for these cells. Similar studies with Vero cells (data not shown) also indicated cytostasis, consistent with the dose response. In contrast, the growth rate of the IM9 cells becomes negative at higher concentrations of GSK983. This indicates cell death, consistent with the observed dose response with I\nmax approaching 100%.",

As noted in Section 3, we used the ratio of viral DNA to MTS activity as an indicator of the level of viral DNA per cell, and that analysis demonstrates a significant reduction of viral DNA (Fig. 3).

Cell growth was also inhibited with similar K values, and we showed for W12 cells that the inhibition was cytostatic. As a result, the maximum inhibition is significantly less than 100%. In our first analysis, we looked at the ratio of HPV DNA to MTS activity, which is reduced by GSK983, indicating a drop in viral copy number per cell which was confirmed by qPCR. This suggests a selective antiviral effect. In a second approach to studying selectivity, we measured the effect of GSK983 on primary human keratinocytes, the uninfected cells most closely related to the W12 line, and found a difference of K values of over 8000-fold (Fig. 5 and Table 3).

All of these lines have two things in common. First, their growth is dependent on the virus. Second, their growth is inhibited at similar median effect concentrations (K), and these K values for growth are also similar to the median effect concentrations for inhibition of viral yield. As we consider the mechanism, we can envision three possible explanations for GSK983's role in the observed activity. First, GSK983 could inhibit the viral replication, and that inhibition could lead to cytostasis, since growth of the cell line is dependent on the virus. If this is the case, the observed inhibition should be dependent on copy number, and it is not. The W12 cell line has approximately 1000 episomal copies of HPV (Stanley et al., 1989), the HKC/HPV16 line has 60\u201380 episomal copies (Lee et al., 2004), and the integrated line has even fewer copies, but all of these lines have similar growth rates (data not shown) and K values for inhibition (Table 3). Furthermore, we observed similar effects on growth in both episomal lines, where the copy number can decrease, and the integrated lines, where copy number is fixed (Table 3, Table 4). The second possible explanation is that reduction of viral copy number is a simple consequence of the induction of cytostasis by GSK983. This is also unlikely, since cytostasis is not induced in uninfected keratinocytes, but clearly requires the presence of the virus (Table 3). Consequently, the third explanation seems to be the most likely: reduction of viral copy number and cell growth rate are parallel consequences of the effects of GSK983 on a single target.",

Comparing the potent inhibition of the viral-immortalized cell lines with the lack of effect on related primary cells gives a selectivity index of approximately 1000. As above, this is an imperfect comparison, since the genetic lineages of the primary and immortalized cells are not identical, but it is very suggestive of a selective effect and clearly shows that GSK983 does not cause apoptosis in the primary cells, even when they are activated. We also note that the number of cell line passages since the viral immortalization event does not influence the outcome of the assay. The freshly immortalized 5/2/1 B-LCLs behave in the same fashion as the much older IM9 cell line. This suggests that the viral immortalization is the key to the cell line's susceptibility, not other events that may have occurred during subsequent rounds of replication.",

This suggests that the mechanism could involve induction of a gene or set of genes in the host cell. Further studies comparing gene expression in the HPV W12 system and primary keratinocytes revealed that a subset of interferon-stimulated genes is up-regulated in the W12 cells, but not the primary keratinocytes. That result is not confined to the HPV W12 system, but was confirmed in a second cell line immortalized by an adenovirus (Fig. 9). Also notable is the negative result: the interferons themselves are not up-regulated.",

It is possible that the multiple activities described above result from the action of GSK983 with similar potency on multiple targets. For instance, the current data do not rule out the scenario in which the antiviral effect on adenovirus-5 replication in primary cells is due to inhibition of a viral target, and all of the effects observed in immortalized and transformed cell lines are due to a separate mechanism with a cellular target. If this is the case, the mechanisms of GSK983 are still of interest, because of both the compound's potent inhibition of adenovirus, and its clear selectivity for immortalized cells over primary cells.",

The effects of GSK983, which all manifest in a relatively narrow concentration range, could result from the action of the compound on a single cellular target. If this is the case, the cell lines and viral replications that are susceptible to GSK983 must have in common some feature not shared with the primary cells and the viral replications that are not susceptible. All of the susceptible cell lines, whether immortalized by viral infection, integration of viral genes or by other non-viral means, have abnormal cellular DNA replication and loss of normal cell cycle control. By definition, the primary cell types do not have these features. Furthermore, we showed that two viruses that actively turn on cellular DNA replication during their productive replication are susceptible to GSK983. Ad-5, SV40 and HPV share this property (Knipe and Howley, 2007). Ad-5 and SV40 were inhibited by GSK983 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), but we were unable to study productive replication of HPV due to lack of a suitable experimental system. The viruses we studied that are not susceptible to GSK983 either do not actively promote cellular DNA replication, as in the case of HIV, or they actively block it, as in the case of lytic replication of the herpesviruses EBV (Kudoh et al., 2006) and HSV (Song et al., 2000). Thus, the susceptibility to GSK983 correlates with loss of normal cell cycle control.",

In order to continue viral replication or immortalization, these defenses must be inactivated.

This mechanism could at the same time produce both the direct anti-viral effect and the cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis that we have observed (reviewed in Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). This proposed mechanism would also explain the lack of observed activity of GSK983 against the primary cell types studied.
