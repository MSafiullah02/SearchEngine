Specifically, adenoviral vaccines encoding target antigen transgenes are the subject of extensive preclinical studies due to their established capacity for generating immune responses (Kim et al., 2016; Zaric et al., 2019). The skin is an ideal vaccination site containing an innate immune network that is exquisitely responsive to environmental stimuli and capable of inducing a proinflammatory microenvironment, favoring the generation of strong and long-lasting adaptive immunity (Kabashima et al., 2019; Kashem et al., 2017). To exploit the readily accessible cutaneous immune network, vaccine delivery technologies, such as microneedle arrays (MNAs), have been developed to precisely and reproducibly target immunologically active cargos to skin microenvironments (Kim et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Traditional vaccines, though often effective in inducing antibody responses, frequently fail to generate robust cytotoxic-T-cell (CTL) responses, which are essential to prevent or treat many cancers or infectious diseases. Currently, induction of antigen specific cellular immunity is a point of emphasis in the vaccine field, as evidenced by recent efforts to generate \u201cuniversal vaccines\u201d for mutable infectious agents (e.g., influenza, HIV, and Coronaviruses). These target infected cells expressing functionally essential viral antigens, instead of, or in addition to, more traditional viral surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies but are highly mutable (Herolds et al., 2020). Successful integration of adenovector vaccines onto coated, or into dissolvable, MNAs has been shown to induce efficacious and durable antigen-specific responses in preclinical studies (DeMuth et al., 2013; Vrdoljak et al., 2012; Bachy et al., 2013). Despite these promising results, clinical translation of adenovector vaccines has been hampered by limited efficacy, thereby defining an unmet need to enhance the immune responses induced by adenovirus vaccines. Here, we generated a three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent skin-targeted vaccine platform, combining an adenovirus-encoded antigen with an adjuvant to induce stronger cellular immune responses. Specifically, we developed dissolving MNAs to simultaneously co-deliver adenovectors encoding the transgene for the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) together with Poly(I:C), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-triggering double-stranded RNA molecule, to the cutaneous microenvironment, with the primary goal of enhancing antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Dissolvable MNAs are designed to mechanically penetrate the superficial cutaneous layers, rapidly dissolve upon insertion into the skin, and deliver uniform quantities of biocargo to a defined 3D space within the skin (Korkmaz et al., 2015). They enable localized delivery of low amounts of drugs or vaccines to achieve high concentrations in a specific skin microenvironment.",

            "text": "Innate cell-signaling pathways (e.g., downstream of TLRs) are well-studied targets for the rational design of vaccine adjuvants for protein subunit vaccines (Schijns et al., 2006); however, they have yet to be comprehensively evaluated in the context of recombinant viral vectored vaccines due to significant mechanistic differences, including differences in the kinetics and amount of antigen expression. Among TLR family members, TLR3 signaling imparts unique responses, such as secretion of immunostimulatory IFN-\u03b2 and CXCL10, due to its distinct downstream pathways. While other TLRs signal through adaptor protein MyD88, TLR3 uses the TIR-domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) adapter protein, with subsequent activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (Boehme et al., 2004; Schijns et al., 2006). Here, using in vivo mouse models, we demonstrate that MNA delivery of the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) with antigen-encoding adenovectors results in proinflammatory changes in the targeted skin microenvironment that correlate with robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses. For these studies, mice were used at 8-10 weeks of age, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols and guidelines.",

Thus, adding Poly(I:C) to this MNA-delivered adenovirus vaccine significantly improved antigen-specific cellular immunity while maintaining strong antibody responses.

In particular, statistical analyses showed that the addition of Poly(I:C) significantly increased IFNB1 (\nFigure 2\nd\n) and CXCL10 (Figure 2e) expression at 6 hr, with respect to blank (empty) MNAs or MNA-Ad alone, which suggests that Poly(I:C) plays a distinctive role during early skin immunomodulation. Furthermore, the inclusion of Poly(I:C) continued to significantly enhance the expression of CXCL10 (Figure 2e) at later time points (24 hr and 48 hr) compared to blank MNA and MNA-Ad alone groups, consistent with a sustained chemoattractant effect of Poly(I:C). Importantly, these pro-inflammatory effects of Poly(I:C) correlate with enhanced systemic CTL responses. Expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which can be induced by a broad range of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), was elevated in MNA-immunized skin microenvironments at early time points (6 hr) regardless of vaccine components (Figure 2f, g), likely as a result of the mechanical stress of microneedle application. Interestingly, at later time points (48 hr and 72 hr), after resolution of the transient mechanical stress generated by microneedles, both Adenovirus and/or Poly (I:C) evoked significant increases in IL-1B expression in the skin microenvironment, and the combination of Ad.OVA and Poly(I:C) sustained elevated levels of IL-6 through 48h.",

Specifically, our results demonstrate that Poly(I:C) adjuvanted MNA adenovirus vaccines elicit significantly improved CTL responses compared to adenovirus alone, while generating antibody responses at least as good as adenovirus alone. MNA-delivered vaccines have the potential to offer advantages of ease of fabrication, application, and storage compared to other vaccine delivery platforms. Our results suggest that multicomponent MNA vaccine platforms, uniquely enabling delivery of both adjuvant and antigen-encoding viral vectors to the same skin microenvironment, result in improved immunogenicity including cellular immune responses, thereby contributing to efforts to develop universal vaccines and improve global immunization capabilities.",

Images of MNAs (a) before and (b) after application were obtained using optical stereomicroscopy. Scale bars = 500 \u03bcm. In vivo multicomponent vaccine delivery performance of MNAs was evaluated by fluorescent live animal imaging following application of MNAs incorporating Alexa488-labeled Poly(I:C) and Alexa555-labeled Ad.OVA to the right ears of mice. Mice were imaged using the IVIS 200 system with filters corresponding to (c) Alexa488 and (d) Alexa555 to demonstrate simultaneous co-delivery of Ad.OVA and Poly (I:C).
