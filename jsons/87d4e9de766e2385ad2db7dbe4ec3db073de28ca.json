Towards On February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached as high as 75,993 in China. Among these cases, 2239 died, and most of the deaths occurred in elderly patients with certain underlying illnesses. [6] [7] [8] To confront this terrible epidemic, China took restrictive measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Restricting the population movement, shutting down of schools and factories, building up new shelter hospitals, and many other measures were carried out. In addition to ordinary measures, the lockdown of Wuhan since January 23, 2020, a city with more than 10 million people, was a unique and unusual method. At the same time, many provinces and cities in China initiated a level I public health event response. To further control the epidemic, from February 5th, 2020, all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients and close contacts in Wuhan were asked to quarantine at assembly sites instead of home quarantine.

The external linear correlation suggests that the number of new deaths in the coming week will decline rapidly, leading to the conclusion that the epidemic would terminate soon. [9] However, there are many other different opinions. The University of Lancaster, the University of Florida, and the Centre for Viral Research at the University of Glasgow carried out modeling analysis based on the data before January 21, 2020. They estimated that the number of infected individuals may be as high as 14464 cases on January 22, 2020 in Wuhan. If there were no effective measures, the total number of infection cases would reach as high as 105077 on January 29, 2020. [10] A team of researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China and York University in Canada worked together to build a more realistic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, and the novel coronavirus infection could reach an inflection point on March 10, 2020. [11] Big gaps existed between different predictions. Which one is identical with the actual situation?",
