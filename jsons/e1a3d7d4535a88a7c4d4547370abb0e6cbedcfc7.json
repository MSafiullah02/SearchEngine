These include protocols pertinent to safety, in-office Rhinologic procedures, the substitution of imaging for endoscopy, and understanding the appropriate role of telemedicine.

There have been reports that during a transsphenoidal resection performed in China, all 14 individuals in the operating room, ranging from the surgeons to ancillary staff, contracted COVID-19 despite some of them using N95 masks and other PPE. They have posited this may be due to viral particles becoming aerosolized during epithelial disruption, and that these viral particles may stay in the surrounding air for 3 hours or longer. Similarly, COVID-19 cases were contracted following other endoscopic endonasal cases. Surgeon and staff COVID-19 infections anecdotally appear to be eliminated with the use of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs). In addition to these communications, the Stanford group suggests COVID-19 testing for all surgical patients, if possible two tests due to the prospects of a false negative especially in those groups that had previously tested positive.",

Providers can take this opportunity to triage who needs nasal endoscopy, but this requires guidelines to be developed on this for the future. In our practices, we feel that this involves several categories of patients. Patients with unilateral sinonasal symptoms warrant a repeat in-person visit after telemedicine for nasal endoscopy, as well as patients with imaging demonstrating unilateral disease. High-risk patients such as immunocompromised patients present a quandary, particularly during these COVID-19 times. These are the individuals who you would want to stay home, and that would certainly be appropriate during the initial telemedicine visit. Nonetheless, there should be a low threshold for considering nasal endoscopy on them if they are having troublesome new onset symptoms such as severe pain, fevers, and other systemic symptoms. Patients with a known tumor history need appropriate surveillance and are not amenable to simply a telemedicine visit without nasal endoscopy, however depending on the severity of the previous lesion, perhaps some of these routine surveillance visits can be performed remotely with imaging replacing endoscopy for surveillance. Finally, while many epistaxis patients can be seen remotely and instructed on conservative measures for minimizing epistaxis, this is not always possible, particularly in this day and age characterized by an expanding repertoire of blood-thinning medications.",

            "text": "In the current litigious environment that characterizes the practice of medicine, the medicolegal risks of not performing nasal endoscopy need to be further determined. Malpractice litigation has had an impact on the practice of all aspects of Otolaryngology, including sinonasal disease and endoscopic skull base surgery [10] [11] [12] [13] . As the pandemic continues and as there are risks for subsequent \"waves\" this fall and winter, guidelines for when imaging can be considered in lieu of nasal endoscopy can be a helpful resource on which to fall back. In addition to surgical misadventure, missed diagnoses have been demonstrated to play a role in pursuing litigation. Therefore, in patients in whom we decide to perform imaging for the purposes of facilitating telehealth visits and follow ups, we need to still maintain a low threshold for inperson consultation when there are findings in imaging warranting follow-up. Communication with patients is key in this regard, as perceived inadequacies in informed consent play a large role in medicolegal litigation. We need to be clear that in these cases, CT imaging is a valuable tool that we are using as an alternative to nasal endoscopy to minimize in-person visits and risk.",

Those serving on the front lines, including those working in hospital settings, the emergency department, and critical care units, are at greatest risk. Otolaryngologists harbor unique risks due to the viral particles residing in the nasopharynx and nose. This makes nasal endoscopy and other in-office rhinologic procedures a concern for the Otolaryngologist with increased risk for infection. Rhinologists need to develop standardized guidelines with an eye to both the present and the future due to the troubling potential for additional \"waves\" of the pandemic, and what the Rhinologist needs to do as they get back to work both in the office and the OR. These include protocols pertinent to safety, the substitution of imaging for endoscopy when appropriate, and importantly, understanding the role of telemedicine. Additionally, it is important for Rhinologists to be prepared with practical information about the differences between various types of telemedicine and how to bill appropriately.",
