As part of the program, a clinical decision support tool was Abstract Introduction: The dissemination of quality improvement (QI) interventions to a broader range of healthcare settings requires a proactive assessment of local work systems and processes. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a survey-based work system assessment (WSA) tool to facilitate the dissemination of a program for optimizing blood culture (BC) use. Methods: Informed by findings from an onsite, interview-based WSA at 2 hospitals, a 50-item WSA survey was devised and administrated to 15 hospitals participating in a QI collaborative. WSA survey data were summarized, shared, and discussed with individual hospitals to inform the adaptation and implementation of the BC program. Physician champions leading the local QI team assessed the use of the WSA survey by completing an 8-item survey. Results: A total of 347 clinicians completed the WSA survey, and physician champions at 12 hospitals evaluated the use of the WSA survey. Both the WSA survey data and the evaluation of the WSA survey showed that the survey-based WSA tool could help participating hospitals understand their current BC ordering practices and identify potential barriers to implementing the program from the perspectives of different clinicians. Conclusions: We demonstrated how a survey-based tool could be used to facilitate WSA in the dissemination of a program for improving BC use to a multisite collaborative. A survey-based WSA tool can be used to facilitate future large-scale intervention dissemination efforts. (Pediatr Qual Saf 2020;2:e288; doi: 10.1097/pq9.0000000000000288; Published online April 9, 2020.) developed to guide clinicians to consider possible sources of infection, evaluate noninfectious sources of fever, and carefully review risk factors of patients for bloodstream infections. The implementation of the program resulted in a reduction in the total number of BCs collected by 46%. 7 Two additional hospitals then decided to adopt the program. The research team performed a WSA by interviewing different stakeholders (eg, physicians and nurses) during a 2-day trip to each hospital. 6 Informed by findings of the WSA, the 2 hospitals adapted the program to their context and achieved a 21%\u221237% reduction in BC use. 8 Given the initial success of the program, a multisite collaborative called Bright STAR was created to scale-up the program and assess its broader impact on BC use and patient safety. The Bright STAR collaborative includes 15 hospitals across 14 states whose PICUs vary in size and patient volume. Each participating hospital convened a local QI team, led by 2 physician champions, and involving many other stakeholders. The research team routinely communicated with the local QI teams through various avenues, including an initial individual site call, monthly individual site calls, monthly all-site calls, and individual and group emails. Because of the number and geographic span of the participating hospitals, the research team could not visit each hospital and conduct in-person interviews. With limited capabilities and resources, the local QI teams could also not easily conduct their own WSA. Therefore, the research team adapted the onsite, interview-based WSA to a survey-based WSA. In this article, we examine the feasibility of using the survey-based WSA for large-scale dissemination.",

A few hospitals indicated that certain aspects of the BC ordering process were not included in the WSA survey, which could be an intrinsic disadvantage of any survey tool. Trade-offs regarding the content of the survey always have to be made. Based on our experience, the in-depth qualitative interviews were necessary to inform the design of the WSA survey.",

As shown by the WSA survey data, different clinicians had different opinions about the current and ideal BC ordering practices. The survey-based WSA ensured the consideration and integration of these different opinions and boosted the early engagement of different clinicians in the dissemination process. During the evaluation of the WSA survey, a few hospitals reflected the drawbacks of not surveying pediatric specialists who played a critical role in BC ordering. Future efforts using survey-based WSA need to identify all key stakeholders to be surveyed carefully. The survey-based WSA itself can also be a tool to help identify relevant stakeholders.",

The research team played an essential role in summarizing, sharing, reviewing, and discussing the WSA survey data with the participating hospitals. Although the involvement of researchers is not a necessary condition for the successful use of the survey-based WSA, someone has to take the responsibility to coordinate and manage the entire process, including the design and administration of the WSA survey, and the analysis and sharing of the survey-based WSA data.",
