Morphological and functional anomalies of the airway causing (partial) obstruction, particularly midfacial hypoplasia and airway malacia [19], alongside immunological variations including reduced leukocytes, particularly T- and B-cell subpopulations [20\u201323], increase susceptibility to and severity of respiratory infections. Increased admissions may also be due to uncertainty regarding speed of deterioration or oxygen requirements, and many admissions may be precautionary, also reflected by the higher prescribing rates in children with DS. In this context, parents have reported that some doctors seem \u2018afraid\u2019 of children with DS [24]. It will be important to identify whether the high rates of admission are related to severity of the infection, time at presentation, time and type of antibiotics prescribed, or other factors. Further research should determine why more than 70% of RTI-related hospitalisations were not preceded by a recorded GP consultation as this may represent an opportunity to avert admission through timely community-based treatment. Regional analyses may be helpful, comparing Clinical Commissioning Groups with high and low rates of RTI-related health utilisation, to highlight areas of best practice and whether local community initiatives exist that can avert unnecessary attendances.",

Although not explored by this study, further research may also want to examine prescribing rates for antivirals for influenza in children with DS. These are rarely prescribed for children without DS, despite recommendations to do so [27, 28].
