The continuation and proper dose or target of ISD is still matter of debate.1 Moreover, no proven effective therapeutic intervention other than supportive care is now available. The scale of the outbreak and the considerable severity of the disease in many cases have prompted several pharmacologic interventions. Laboratory research has identified more than 30 agents that may have potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.2\u20134 Drugs that have been and are being tested in humans include (hydroxy)chloroquine, darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/COB) or DRV/ritonavir (DRV/r), favipiravir, interferon (IFN), lopinavir/r (LPV/r), ribavirin, remdesivir (manufactured by Gilead, Foster City, CA), and tocilizumab (manufactured by Roche, Basel, Switzerland, and Chugai, Tokyo, Japan), the last 2 being available for compassionate use or for clinical trials). There is no consensus on which pharmacotherapeutic strategy to follow.

Furthermore, COVID-19 patients may exhibit features of systemic hyperinflammation (designated as \u201ccytokine storm\u201d), which can be associated with so-called \u201cphenoconversion,\u201d a phenomenon whereby extensive metabolizers transiently exhibit drug metabolizing enzyme activity at a comparable level as that of poor metabolizers.6,7 Commonly, ISDs are characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and wide PK variability, requiring close monitoring of the blood concentrations. Also, the metabolic pathways involved in clearance of ISDs make these drugs extremely susceptible for drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs). Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, their oral bioavailability is poor, erratic and also limited by the fact that they are substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp or ABCB1).8 Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a prodrug that is converted in vivo into mycophenolic acid (MPA). The metabolism of MPA mainly involves glucuronidation by the uridine 5\u2032-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme superfamily.9 MPA is subjected to entero-hepatic recirculation, which extends its terminal half-life. Hepatic excretion of MPA glucuronide (MPAG) is driven by uptake from the portal vein through OATP1B3 and, to a lesser extent, OATP1B1. MPAG is then excreted in the bile actively through ABCC2.10",

It acts by inhibiting the action of heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, thereby blocking the formation of hemozoin from heme which is released by the digestion of hemoglobin.11 Chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, have since then been repurposed for the treatment of a number of other conditions including viral infections, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine is an analogue of chloroquine in which one of the N-ethyl substituents of chloroquine is \u03b2-hydroxylated. Generally, hydroxychloroquine is preferred when high doses are required because of its lower level of toxicity and higher therapeutic index.12 Moreover, hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 \u03bcmoles/L) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 \u03bcmoles/L) in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.13 A recent clinical trial in France reported that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load.14 However, this study has limitations, including bias in its design that renders the interpretation of these results delicate. Other preliminary results obtained from patients are conflicting.15 The relevance of (hydroxy)chloroquine for treating COVID-19 is now being evaluated in larger, more controlled, multicenter randomized clinical trials.16",

As these symptoms can occur as a result of COVID-19, they might be wrongly attributed to the viral infection itself instead of drug-associated cardiac toxicity. Consequently, we recommend that these drugs should only be administered when cardiac monitoring is available.CsA blood concentrations should be closely monitored as an increase in CsA exposure is expected and the dose may need to be decreased.The same may be anticipated with Tac, EVR, and sirolimus (SRL) due to a potential competitive inhibition through CYP3A4/5.Analytical solutions exist for monitoring (hydroxy)chloroquine drug concentrations.31\u201333 Regarding efficacy, interpretation of such TDM data is difficult because of the lack of data on target concentrations, timing of measurement, and drug adjustment strategy in the context of COVID-19 treatment. Avoiding toxic exposure is even more important considering the long half-life of (hydroxy)chloroquine; hence, monitoring (hydroxy)chloroquine concentrations is suggested for this purpose. However, so far, there are no data to identify the threshold concentration for increased toxicity. Based on in vitro data and physiologically based PK modeling, it has been recently suggested that a plasma concentration of 0.1 mcg/mL (0.3\u20130.5 mcg/mL in whole blood) might be sufficient to generate a lung concentration far above the EC50 for SARS-CoV-2.13",

Cotreatment with boosted PI regimens is thus inherently challenging because of their complex spectrum of DDIs. DRV, LPV and their boosters, either RTV or COB, inhibit (and sometimes induce) various cytochromes and transporters, thereby affecting also other therapies like ISD. Indeed, DRV is a substrate for CYP3A, ABCB1, ABCC2, OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3,41 with the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, ABBC2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. LPV is metabolized primarily through CYP3A hepatic metabolism and transported by ABCB1 and ABCB2. LPV has been reported to induce its own metabolism (ie, CYP3A) but also other CYP (eg, CYP2B6) through PXR activation42 and constitutes a potent inhibitor of ABCC2.43,44 Meanwhile, the boosters, RTV and COB, exert slightly different effects: both are capable of inhibiting CYP3A, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, while RTV may also induce other CYP isoforms.45\u201347 RTV also increases the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by glucuronidation catalyzed by UGT, although the clinical relevance of this effect is not clear. Through their inhibition on ABCB1 and CYP3A, it is expected that those drugs influence CNIs and mTORi PK while by their inhibitor activity on OATP and ABCC2 as well as induction of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 through PXR activation,48 they can interfere with MPA entero-hepatic recirculation and exposure.49",

Given the large interindividual variability of ISD PKs, predicting exposure during drug interaction appears very hazardous. The main concern when using PI with CNIs is not only an increase in area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) but also the potential reshaping of the PK profile of the IS agent resulting in a more flattened curve.58 The underlying assumption for CNI monitoring using a single sample is that this correlates with the AUC, which is considered the best measure of drug exposure. The total drug exposure is indeed increased, as reflected by the higher AUC, but the curve is smoothed. Consequently, some patients may exhibit a flat PK profile and the anticipated relationship, for example, the C0/AUC ratio, may therefore change.59 For CsA, it was demonstrated that the concentration at 4 hours correlated better with AUC than C0 or C2. The best single time-point to monitor thus appears to have shifted from 2 hours (usual case) to at least 4 hours when coadministered with a PI. Similar trends as with CNIs were seen with transplant subjects on SRL53 and EVR. Drastic reduction in SRL dosing has been reported in patients on HIV PIs.56,57",

            "text": "When considering boosted PI therapy, we recommend that ISD dose be significantly reduced and also dosing intervals should be increased to once a week or twice a week.For Tac and CsA, data suggest that dosing regimens of 0.5\u20131 mg once weekly for Tac and 25 mg every 1\u20132 days for CsA are appropriate when coadministered with boosted PI regimens. Solutions of microdosing might also be useful if further dose reduction is needed (eg, tacrolimus granules for oral suspension 0.2 mg, 2 or 3 times per week).60In addition to drastic dose reduction, TDM should be conducted from day 1 of the coadministration thereafter, on a daily basis until stable (target) concentrations are reached.Characterizing the full exposure (AUC) could be a valuable option when a PK reshaping is suspected as was proposed for Tac in the recent IATDMCT consensus on Tac TDM.61In the intensive care unit (ICU), the presence of a central arterial line facilitates multiple sampling to determine the AUC. However, the measures of isolation of COVID-19 patients in the hospital might restrict the entry to their rooms. Limited sampling strategy (LSS) with Bayesian estimation of AUC can be proposed as an alternative.62\u201364 Noninvasive sampling technique such as dried blood spot analysis is another possibility but seems more appropriate for transplant patients with mild complaints who are in quarantine at home.62,63,65,66o For Tac, a target AUC0\u201312h of 100\u2013190 ng\u00b7h/mL ng.h/mL for twice daily regimen and AUC0\u201324h of 180\u2013350 ng\u00b7h/mL for once daily is proposed. These values correspond to a C0 target between 5 and 10 ng/mL.61,67 If lower/higher C0 are aimed for, the AUC target should be lowered/increased accordingly.61o For CsA, in kidney transplant, it is recommended to target a AUC0\u201312 of 3250 ng\u00b7h/mL at 1 year after transplantation.68,69 Alternatively, exposure during the first 4 hours (AUC0\u20134h) is normally a reliable estimate of total drug exposure.69\u201371 However, caution should be taken for AUC0\u20134 interpretation because of the possible reshaping of the PK curves observed with PIs coadministration (see above).For other ISDs, the pharmacokinetics of which is greatly influenced by CYP activity, such as mTORi an important shift in drug exposure with boosted PIs is expected although less-well defined than for CNIs. Because of the long half-life of SRL (62 hours in stable renal transplant recipients) and EVR (\u223c30 hours), it is recommended that the dosing frequency of SRL and EVR when coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be extended to achieve target trough concentrations.72 However, for practical reasons, greater dose reductions with weekly dosing intervals appear more practical when PI and mTORi are coadministered. With LPV/r coadministration, it has been suggested to decrease the SRL maintenance dose to 0.2 mg/wk57",

This information is of importance as the hepatic uptake of MPAG and subsequent biliary excretion is a prerequisite for MPA entero-hepatic recirculation, which is estimated to account for up to 61% of total MPA exposure.73 However, no data are currently available to support an important PK interaction between boosted PI regimens and MPA.",

This decision is reinforced by the fact that it seems that MMF reduces the seroresponse of transplanted patients, as observed during the H1N1 pandemic.75,76 However, if it is decided that MMF should be continued, we recommend caution and MPA monitoring with possible MMF dosage adjustment in COVID-19\u2013positive transplant patients. There is difficulty in defining which time point to measure for MPA monitoring. MPA C0 cannot be considered as a good surrogate for total exposure but is the most practical if a single time point is to be used.77 Ideally, AUC0\u201312h should be obtained from samples collected during the whole dose interval as it is considered as the most robust PK marker. However, the blood collection schedules for AUC0\u201312h measurement are not practically sustainable in a crisis situation where access to COVID-19 dedicated rooms is restricted because of a high risk of medical staff infection. Alternatively, LSS have been proposed with at least 3 time points, commonly within 3 hours after drug intake. Further TDM strategies recommend to include an additional time point later than 4 hours to catch the second peak due to enterohepatic recycling (preferably around 8 or 9 hours after MMF dosing).77 Extending the LSS this way could also compensate for the increased uncertainty of PK models which have not been validated in patients with this combination of interfering drugs.",

What happens at the cellular level is a high production of GM-CSF and others inflammatory cytokines by CD4+ T cells with further activation of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes to produce interleukin-6 (IL-6). It was postulated that blocking GM-CSF or IL-6 receptor would potentially reduce immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2.86 Tocilizumab is a humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody, which can specifically bind soluble or membrane type IL-6 receptors. To date, it has been widely used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis87 and large vessel vasculitis.88 Since in most of severe SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected patients significantly higher serum levels of inflammatory mediators are found than in stable ones, a beneficial impact of this drug has been postulated in severe cases. A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial is under way to examine the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029765), administered as compassionate use off label for this new pathology.",

However, it would be prudent to consider this interaction for ISD that are metabolized by CYP3A4 due to altered proinflammatory cytokines concentrations in severe COVID-19 cases (cytokine storm).",

On the one hand, complete or partial (with only glucocorticoids monotherapy) treatment, discontinuation of other ISD might help infection recovery and has been proposed by some authors in kidney transplant patients with severe pneumonia including case reports on COVID-19 infections,92\u201394 but exposed patients to graft rejection. In case of severe pneumonia, discontinuation of MPA has also been proposed as a first step due to its low viral safety profile, while mTORi can lead to interstitial pneumonia which cannot be easily distinguished from SARS-CoV-2\u2013induced lung disease.95 On the other hand, optimizing ISD exposure during this highly variable phase requires pharmacological considerations and a close monitoring of the patients. Practical details to consider are the drug formulation (eg, administration of medications through feeding tubes can be opted). However, this may lead to reduced absorption of Tac, in particular when the drug is administered with enteral nutrition. Moreover, diarrhea and other changes in gastrointestinal motility can lead to an increase in Tac exposure.96 Also, the inflammatory state of the patient is important to consider. It has been demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines may downregulate cytochrome P450 expression (phenoconversion).97 Even without any consideration for DDI with COVID-19 treatment, a particular look should be given to biological inflammation parameters prompting clinicians to decrease dosages of ISDs particularly for substrates of CYP3A4/5 (ie, Tac, CsA, EVR, SRL) and, if the drugs are administered through feeding tubes, whether they are administered apart from enteral nutrition. It also appears reasonable to target the lowest acceptable ISD blood exposure (eg, up to a trough concentration of 3\u20135 ng/mL or preferably an AUC0\u201312 of 75\u2013100 ng.h/mL for Tac) when monitoring patients during COVID-19 infections. In the ICU setting, due to the large PK variability observed in critical care patients, the frequent and close monitoring of ISD drugs is mandatory to optimize patient's management.",

Not only is this population more at risk of infection but, as described throughout this manuscript, management of ISD therapy is a real challenge. Little evidence exists to guide clinicians. Initiation of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy can throw the established ISD response off balance either from a PD or from a PK point of view. We provide here some considerations and recommendations aiming at helping clinicians in managing investigational COVID-19 treatments in ISD-treated transplant patients. Caution and careful monitoring should be the rule when experimental COVID-19 treatments are being initiated in ISD-treated transplant recipients irrespective of the drug combination. These considerations are made in the context of hospitalized transplant recipient suffering from COVID-19. For those patients who are in quarantine at home, dried blood spot\u2013based home blood collection and TDM appear as appropriate solutions to avoid potential exposure of these patients during travel and at clinics, doctor's, or phlebotomist's offices. Finally, an additional attention and extension of careful TDM measures should be envisaged when stopping drugs coadministration because of possible reversion of the phenotypic consequences.",
