Analytical sensitivity was determined using ten-fold serially diluted standard RNA ranging from 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 0 copies/\u03bcL, stored at \u221230\u00b0C until required. High-speed RT-qPCR amplification using GeneSoC \u00ae (Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was performed using SpeedSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and real-time detection of the amplification product was simultaneously monitored by the measurement of emission. The detailed composition of reaction reagents, together with the primers and probe targeting the specific sequence of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 are listed in Table 1 [6]. Finally, 5 \u03bcL of the RNA template was added to the amplification mixture, and distilled water was added to a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. Amplification conditions were as follows: 42\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by 50 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 4 s and 58\u00b0C for 8 s. Amplification results were considered positive if an exponential amplification curve was generated that could be distinguished from that of the negative control. All reactions were performed in duplicate. ",

RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples is still a core technology for determining the need for the hospitalization and 7 isolation of patients with COVID-19, but this method generates false negatives and is time consuming [8] . A history of exposure to patients with COVID-19 along with the characteristic CT findings of viral pneumonia strongly suggest COVID-19 and can provide a basis for patient management, even if a sample is negative by RT-qPCR [9, 10] . However, CT images are not specific to COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of RT-qPCR with extremely high diagnostic specificity for comprehensive diagnosis. The GeneSoC \u00ae assay, which requires a short test period and is not labor-intensive, can contribute to the diagnosis and management of patients and thereby to the prevention of hospital-acquired infections.",

The main advantages of the platform are its simplicity and portability, its capacity for high-speed and real-time monitoring, and the use of a single disposable tip per analysis. GeneSoC \u00ae can be easily transported and does not require highly equipped laboratories. However, it has some disadvantages. First, the analytical sensitivity was lower than that of the conventional RT-qPCR assay used as a reference. Second, the results could be influenced by the sampling procedure and timing, similar to conventional RT-qPCR.",

            "text": "For a preliminary evaluation of the reactivity of GeneSoc in clinical practice, we evaluated clinical samples. A total of 66 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection based on clinical findings. In addition, 12 nasopharyngeal swab samples positive for influenza A, as detected by RT-PCR, collected from Japanese patients in December 2019 were included as a negative control group. Viral RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each swab was suspended in 700 \u03bcL of AVL buffer with 5.6 \u03bcL of carrier RNA and RNA was finally eluted in 60 \u03bcL of AVE buffer. Extracts were amplified by conventional RT-qPCR with at least two technical repeats. Simultaneously, clinical validation of high-speed RT-qPCR using the GeneSoC \u00ae system was performed. Conventional RT-qPCR for the specific amplification of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using TaqMan-based QuantStudio TM 5 Real-Time PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with the same primers and probe used for the GeneSoC \u00ae assay. The final reaction volume was 50 \u00b5L, including 5 \u00b5L of RNA template, 500 nM forward primer, 700 nM reverse primer, and 200 nM probe. Each reaction was performed using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cycling conditions consisted of reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min; initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min; and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 60 s. This study was approved by the Saitama Medical University Hospital Research Ethics Committee (reference 19136).ResultsFigure 2shows the real-time amplification plots obtained using GeneSoC \u00ae . The minimum detectable amount of RNA was 1.0 \u00d7 10 1 copies/reaction. With this protocol, real-time amplification could be performed in less than 15 min.Of the 25 samples that were positive by conventional RT-qPCR, 23 (92.0%) were also identified as positive by GeneSoC \u00ae and the results for two samples were difficult to interpret as positive or negative due to weak signals. The median Ct value obtained by conventional RT-qPCR for 25 positive samples was 30.4 (range, 17.2-37.0) and specific amplification was not observed for the samples with the low Ct value (36.7, 36.8). In all 41 samples that were negative by conventional RT-qPCR and 12 RNA specimens derived from patients with influenza A, no amplification was observed using GeneSoC \u00ae . With respect to the turnaround time, we obtained results within 1 h from RNA purification.",
