After primary infection, the virus typically remains latent with no systemic signs or symptoms of reactivation. However, in the transplant recipient, the effects of CMV are myriad, including a viral syndrome with fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia that may be compounded by immunosuppressive medications, and also tissue-invasive disease, potentially involving the transplanted organ as well as the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract and, rarely, the retina.11 CMV also has been associated with several indirect effects in solid organ tranplant patients, including increased risk of rejection, reduced long-term survival, increased risk of other opportunistic infections, bacterial infections, and allograft dysfunction.12\n",

This approach may be preferable in patients in whom close monitoring for CMV disease is not possible or practical. Although numerous approaches (including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and CMV immunoglobulin) have been associated with a reduction in CMV disease, ganciclovir has been the mainstay of both CMV treatment and prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients after studies showed improved efficacy over acyclovir in this population.13, 14, 15 The intravenous form of ganciclovir has given way to oral formulations at many centers due to ease of administration. Oral ganciclovir has a significantly lower bioavailability than the intravenous form, but at doses of 1 gram three times a day it has proven efficacy in reducing the incidence of CMV disease.16 The valine ester prodrug of ganciclovir, valganciclovir, has improved bioavailability compared to oral ganciclovir, and at doses of 900 mg daily has been shown to be equally efficacious in renal transplant patients,17 with a slightly increased incidence of neutropenia compared to ganciclovir (8.2% vs. 3.2%). Valganciclovir is not indicated for patients undergoing combined liver and kidney transplantation due to reports of breakthrough CMV disease in liver transplant recipients receiving valganciclovir prophylaxis.18\n",

Blood CMV DNA or RNA levels or CMV antigenemia assays can be utilized at weekly intervals for the initial post-transplantation phase, and then at longer intervals as immunosuppression is reduced. Culture techniques, including shell vials, have fallen out of favor due to long turnaround times or poor sensitivity. A randomized trial of prophylactic or preemptive oral valganciclovir was published in 2006, comparing prophyloctic valganciclavir 900 mg daily for 100 days posttransplant and preemptive valganciclovir 900 mg twice a day for 21 days; the trial measured whether CMV DNA levels rose above 2000 copies/mL in blood samples assessed weekly for the first 16 weeks and then at 5, 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplant.

Now that many centers use prophylaxis for the first 3 months after transplant, CMV disease typically occurs later after transplantation, most often at a median of 5 months post-transplant in donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative patients.20, 21 Unfortunately, extension of prophylaxis beyond 3 months raises concerns of drug toxicity or the development of drug resistance, although a study of 301 high-risk solid organ transplant patients who received 100 days of valganciclovir prophylaxis failed to show the development of drug resistance.22 Monitoring immune markers of CMV also does not appear to be predictive of the development of CMV disease, as a recent study by LaRosa and colleagues23 suggests. This study examined interferon gamma release from T cells at biweekly intervals between 4 and 6 months after transplant. No association was found between presence or absence of T-cell response and development of CMV disease.23 However, the failure to develop IgG antibodies at 6 months\u2014 post-transplant in patients seronegative at the time of transplant may be predictive of late-onset CMV disease (10% developed disease vs. 1.3% of patients with CMV IgG by 6 months).24\n",

Unfortunately, ganciclovir-resistant CMV has emerged as an uncommon but growing problem in the solid organ transplant population, perhaps due to prolonged use of oral ganciclovir prophylaxis and more potent immunosuppression regimens.25 Although this has not been commonly reported in recipients of kidney transplants alone, it may occur more frequently in pancreas transplant recipients; a major risk factor for this is prolonged exposure to low-dose ganciclovir during periods of asymptomatic infection. Resistance can be detected via phenotypic or genotypic testing, but usually requires additional time. Failure to respond to adequate dosing of ganciclovir should raise a suspicion of ganciclovir resistance, and substitution of another antiviral agent may be warranted. Options for the treatment of resistant CMV include foscarnet with or without ganciclovir and cidofovir, both of which may be highly nephrotoxic, especially when used in the context of calcineurin inhibitors. Adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (CMV specific or nonspecific) has been used for treatment of refractory CMV disease, although there are no large-scale trials or specific guidelines for its use.11\n",

EBV is a member of the Gammaherpesvirus family along with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)/Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). EBV infection in the immunocompetent host may be asymptomatic if acquired during childhood or may result in infectious mononucleosis in young adults. More than 90% of the population is seropositive by adulthood. In the transplant recipient, EBV is associated with PTLD, a group of disorders involving varying degrees of abnormal B-cell and T-cell proliferation. Patients at highest risk for PTLD are seronegative recipients who acquire primary infection after transplantation, making pediatric patients especially vulnerable. The virus is efficiently transmitted via saliva and other body fluids, but may also be transmitted by lymphocytes in the transplanted allograft. The risk of PTLD varies by the organ transplanted, with small-bowel transplant recipients at highest risk; lung, heart, pancreas, and liver patients at moderate risk; and renal transplant recipients at lowest risk (approximately 1%).26, 27, 28 Other risk factors include the type and duration of immunosuppression, including OKT3 and polyclonal antibody use. A recent analysis of the French Registry of PTLD in renal transplant recipients demonstrated an incidence of 1.18% after 5 years, with a 61% survival rate at 5 years after diagnosis.29 Infection with hepatitis B or C was also noted to be a risk factor for patient death, in addition to the more commonly recognized risk factors.",

A low viral load has good negative predictive value, but a high viral load is nonspecific, and certain subtypes of PTLD are EBV-negative.30, 31 Studies are currently underway examining different EBV antigens as markers for patients at risk for developing PTLD and possibly also as surrogate markers for global immunosuppression levels.",

A variety of other treatment modalities are under investigation, including anti-interleukin-6, interferon alfa, and adoptive immunotherapy using the patient's own lymphocytes activated ex vivo.27 Late-onset or EBV-negative PTLD typically does not respond as well to reduction of immunosuppression and thus requires more aggressive therapeutic measures, so early consultation with an oncologist is prudent in these patients.",

Although the response of transplant patients is lower than that of healthy immunocompetent individuals, sufficient levels of protection are likely to occur in most individuals. Early concerns about an increased risk of graft rejection as a result of the immune response to vaccination have not been supported by the literature, and a recent multicenter retrospective analysis of rejection in more than 3000 heart transplant recipients found no association between influenza vaccination and episodes of rejection.50 If infection is suspected, rapid treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom development concurrently with a diagnostic test such as nucleic acid detection. Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir) have become the mainstay of therapy because they are efficacious against both A and B strains of influenza; however, studies specifically evaluating their efficacy in transplant recipients have yet to be conducted.48 Treatment dosing of oseltamivir is 75 mg orally twice a day for 5 days (zanamivir is only available as an inhaled agent). Prophylaxis with oseltamivir may also be beneficial within 48 hours in cases of known or suspected exposure to influenza at a dose of 75 mg orally once a day for a minimum of 10 days. The use of amantidine or rimantidine has fallen out of favor due to the lack of efficacy against influenza B and the recent reports of resistance of influenza A during the 2006 influenza season.51\n",

Widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine was adopted in 1982, further reducing the incidence of hepatitis B acquisition.52 Vaccination of all patients with compensated renal disease well in advance of dialysis dependence should be encouraged using a four-dose vaccine schedule (0, 1, 2, and 6 months), and yearly monitoring of HBsAb titers should be conducted, with booster vaccination given as needed.53 Currently the prevalence among hemodialysis patients is approximately 1.6%. Among dialysis patients who seroconvert, 80% may develop chronic hepatitis B, and a subset of patients who undergo transplantation after becoming HBsAg-negative will reactivate after the transplant.54 Patients who receive a transplant when HBsAg-positive have a poorer prognosis with high rates of chronic hepatitis by 10 years (85%) and also an increased likelihood of sepsis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the posttransplant period.54 A high risk of HBV transmission exists when grafting an HBsAg-positive organ into a seronegative recipient, so this circumstance should be avoided. Transplantation of a hepatitis BsAg-negative/cAb-positive kidney may be undertaken in a seronegative recipient if the recipient is fully vaccinated and the donor is HBV DNA-negative; although the recipient may seroconvert based on the presence of new HBcAb, this did not affect patient survival or graft function.55 Close follow-up of these recipients with monitoring for transmission of hepatitis B is important; the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and pharmacotherapy may be warranted in this situation.",

Treatment with lamivudine typically results in a large reduction in HBV DNA, but resistance may develop with prolonged use of the drug (>1 to 2 years).56 This approach is advocated before transplantation to suppress the viral load and should be continued after transplantation in nonhepatic recipients with chronic hepatitis B. Tenofovir and adefovir have both been associated with nephrotoxicity in patients who are not transplant recipients, raising concerns about their safety in renal transplant recipients. Recent data regarding the use of long-term (up to 5 years) adefovir in chronic hepatitis B patients was recently published, suggesting that this agent is well tolerated, with a small risk of renal insufficiency at 1 to 3 years and a low risk of development of resistance after 5 years.57 A smaller analysis of renal transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B resistant to lamivudine was reported that showed a significant reduction in hepatitis B DNA with no evidence of adefovir-related renal toxicity after a median of 15 months of treatment, although several patients required phosphorus supplementation.58 Pretransplant treatment with interferon-alfa to reduce viral load and promote seroconversion has been investigated in renal transplant recipients, but specific guidelines regarding its use have not been published; this approach is not currently recommended.",

Plasma viral loads greater than 104 copies/mL and urine viral loads greater than 107 copies/mL are suggestive of underlying BK virus nephropathy (BKVN).77 The diagnosis and staging of BKVN requires renal biopsy, and the incidence of BKVN appears to range between 1% and 10% of renal transplant recipients. Recent research has examined the utility of nucleic acid-based detection techniques as screening tools for the development of BK viruria, viremia, and nephropathy.78 Both the level of BK viremia and the presence of recurrent viremia have been correlated with the presence of BKVN.75, 79\n",

Unfortunately many patients with severe renal disease may be anergic, rendering the test unreliable if negative. The recent release of a blood test for interferon-gamma release from patient's sensitized lymphocytes after exposure to purified protein derivative (QuantiFERON test) is promising, but as yet is not indicated for use in immunosuppressed individuals.102 Chest radiographs may be useful for finding evidence of prior or active disease that would warrant further evaluation, especially if no prior treatment or prophylaxis was given. In patients in whom latent TB infection is suggested, treatment with 300 mg of isoniazid daily for 9 months is recommended after evaluation for underlying liver disease. Ideally, prophylaxis should be completed before transplantation and the onset of more severe immunosuppression; however, if the donor had risk factors for latent TB infection, the recipient should receive prophylaxis after transplantation to reduce the risk of transmission of disease.101 Liver function tests should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks of therapy, then monthly, looking for elevations of transaminases greater than 4 times normal.",

Substitution with rifabutin or a quinolone such as levofloxacin is a common approach to eliminate this problem, although rifabutin is still associated with significant drug interactions.101 Once susceptibility of the isolate to isoniazid and rifampin is confirmed, therapy should continue for a minimum of 6 months, if isoniazid and rifampin or rifabutin are used, and longer with other regimens or more severe disease.",
