            "text": "The human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 in respiratory secretions of children suffering from clinical symptoms of viral respiratory infections [1]. Since then the virus has been clinically associated with respiratory infections worldwide and cannot be distinguished from other respiratory viruses on clinical observations alone. The situation becomes more complicated as the virus is frequently detected as one of two or more pathogens and thus it remains unclear if a distinct clinical course is indeed caused by HBoV or whether HBoV is only a bystander [2], [3], [4]\n. This latter statement must in full consequence lead to the conclusion that also other viruses that are detected in concert with other pathogens are only blind passengers rather than true pathogens, but for HBoV the modified Koch\u2019s postulates have not been formally fulfilled due to the lack of an animal model [2], [3], [4]. The co-detections originate on the one hand from the fact that modern diagnostics more and more rely on rapid multiplex assays which detect more pathogens in parallel than ever before. Thus the more questions are being asked, the more answers are produced by a single assay, and in earlier times the multiple infections have simply not been detected due to technical limitations [5], [6], [7], [8], Second, we and others have previously shown that HBoV is likely to persist and therefore could be shed even without being the leading pathogen in an acute infection setting [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

Earlier, our group described the clinical case of a young adult cancer patient suffering from a severe HBoV pneumonia [26]. Also in this earlier patient a severe pneumonia was observed, which is in line with the current observations, and haematological malignancies with immunosuppression appear to be a serious risk factor for HBoV pneumonia. We have also described two cases in which in parallel to HBoV a human herpesvirus was detected, which led us to the hypothesis that HBoV replication can be triggered or influenced by helperviruses of the herpesvirus family [27], [28]. HBoV detections in the BAL of adult patients are frequent [21] but in none of the previous cases the virus was found in the iliac crest. In an earlier study we have analysed the DNA extracted from bone marrow of 20 MDS patients and none of those samples was positive for HBoV DNA. However, the most surprising fact is that in the present case an archived tissue sample, i.e. an FFPE biopsy of a rectal adenoma, was available, that was tested positive for HBoV. This on the one hand confirms our earlier assumptions that the virus may be able to trigger tumour development or could replicate in the growing (micro-) environment of the tumour or its precursors.",

First, it shows that the virus can occur in iliac crest of MDS patients suffering from HBoV associated pneumonia, an observation that to the best of our knowledge was not yet described. It remains, however, to be investigated if HBoV displays any effects on this tissue; earlier observations of our group in contrast have shown that the virus is not generally present in the bone marrow of MDS patients, thus this detection could be a hint for active replication although a viremia was absent. Anyway, it has to be noted that in this earlier study none of the MDS patients suffered from an acute pneumonia as the current patient.",

Due to our restrictive laboratory procedures we can exclude any cross-contamination of the samples with HBoV DNA, and all negative controls and also further patients' samples that were routinely screened in parallel for HBoV DNA were negative. However, the copy numbers in the tissue and the BAL appear low, on the one hand putatively indicating the persistence of the viral DNA in the tissues, on the other hand being accounted to the fact that HBoV replicates in foci [29] and those replikative foci have not been explicitly isolated from the tissue samples nor were exclusively covered by the BAL sampling, which cannot differentiate between healthy tissue and replicative foci.",
