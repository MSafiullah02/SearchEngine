Such Venetian prowess blossomed through the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries\u2014yet was hampered by the recurring arrival of the plague throughout this time span (Lanaro 2006).",

Most victims of the disease died within a matter of days after showing symptoms, which typically included the swelling of lymph nodes into painful and black masses (or buboes) along the body (Boccaccio 1351). Disease control efforts in the earliest stages of the plague were archaic and based largely on superstition (such as a belief in the negative influences of the alignment of certain planets) or even bunk science (the fear of miasmas, or bad airs, in their ability to spontaneously initiate disease). A lack of understanding of modern germ theory prevented medieval governments from instituting top-down plans to manage contagions\u2014leaving populated cities such as Venice exposed to the damage to come.",

Along with a sudden and massive depopulation of various cities, the disease unsettled Medieval social and economic life by grinding trade to a halt, bringing huge swathes of farmland to fallow, and driving religious zealotry to promote flagellants (or those who practiced acts of public self-mutilation to appease what they thought was an angry God), riots, and other forms of civil unrest (Bean 1982; Ziegler 2013). From a perspective of societal resilience, the disease essentially exposed vulnerable societal, economic, and public health assets in Venice and other medieval cities\u2014leading to millions dead and a society permanently changed (Herlihy and Cohn 1997). While risk management could be a helpful method to mitigate the harms wrought by known or well-understood events, such internationally consequential events as the Black Death and subsequent plague outbreaks with unknown or dramatically misperceived causes, transmission, and treatment leave traditional risk assessment incapable of adequately protecting society or alleviating social and economic hazards (Cohn 2009). This is where resilience thinking comes into play, as such a mindset is primarily focused on peering into the unknown and preparing various systems, societies, and elements of infrastructure to withstand hazards of various risk scenarios (Baum 2015).",

Over time, the Venetian government came to fashion some of the earliest verifiable forms of resilience thinking to guide disease control efforts (Cohn 2002). Specifically, these include the appointment of three government agents (or guardians of public health) to govern disease control efforts, along with the eventual construction of formal quarantine zones to hold those suspected of contact with plague. These efforts were a direct attempt to strengthen societal and economic activities in the midst of a catastrophic threat by limiting potential exposure to risk while offering safeguards to prevent disease-driven disruptions of Venetian daily life. It is important to understand that while such measures may seem like common sense today, these efforts at disease control were quite revolutionary for medieval Europe, and in many cases flew in the face of conventional wisdom as prescribed by medieval scholars and healers.",

Where doctors began to take notice of the debilitating skin lesions and strong odor of illness from the plague victims, treatment of such patients became to reduce physical contact between physicians and patients by having medical personnel don long coats and gloves, and making use of a rod or cane to conduct medical examinations if at all possible. Such efforts gave rise to various costumes and images typical of the era (particularly with the plague doctor visage which consisted of a long-beaked mask which contained a reservoir of vinegar or curative herbs in the belief that malodorous air was responsible for the spread of disease), yet they did at least begin to offer some layer of protection to those seeking to offer medical care yet fearful of contracting the virulent disease themselves. Slow but steady success in reducing plague incidence by following these basic guidelines, which despite occasional failures to prevent all disease outbreaks, did over time help reduce most widespread plague outbreaks in Venice. Using protective clothing and offering guidance on how to treat those suspected of carrying plague, Venetian plague guardians and officials helped to disrupt the physical networks of plague propagation at a municipal level.",

They also knew that those who docked along Venice\u2019s ports proceeded further into the old city, through storehouses, and eventually to further maritime trade routes.

For plague management, Venetian lazarettos were generally established on islands (the first, Lazaretto Nuovo Island, gave the practice its name) outside but adjacent to the old city. To further combat the recurring threat of bubonic plague, officials conducted interdiction exercises with incoming ships along the lagoon\u2019s outer islands while the ship\u2019s occupants and cargo were assessed for potential threats.",

This period eventually grew to 40 days, hence the medieval Venetian quaranta giorni becoming the norm for the interdiction of foreign travelers and goods prior to approved city entry (Gensini et al. 2004). However, it was not until the formal adoption of quarantine as a disease control mechanism by Venice that the practice became more structured and universally accepted. The evolution of quarantine in Venice and other cities throughout Europe serves as one of the first physical manifestations of resilience thinking, as the quarantine dynamic of isolating potential unknown and little understood dangers until they are identified or are proven inert inherently breaks the mold of traditional risk management in favor of countering emerging threats.",

Specifically, this includes the construction of a $7 billion flood barrier, which is designed to prevent flooding and help control surges in water level due to storms and tidal surge (Singh 2014). In spite of this proactive effort, some risk analysts have noted their concerns regarding the barrier\u2019s extended efficiency and capability to withstand extreme climate and flood events well into the future (Poggioli 2009). From a resilience perspective, these concerns are not unfounded, as the multi-billion dollar flood barrier project serves as an example of resilience thinking that accounts for the physical domain yet neglects a thorough consideration of others. Along with considerations of global climate uncertainty and the models used to predict significant climactic trends, this flood barrier project does not fully account for uncertainty regarding the potential impacts that a rise in sea level may have upon social, economic, and cognitive functions within Venice and beyond. To rectify this situation, further consideration of the physical, information, social, and cognitive domains are crucial to uphold Venetian society, commerce, and culture in the face of high uncertainty and potentially devastating ecological risk (Fletcher and Spencer 2005).",

An additional challenge to traditional disease control efforts is the heightened level of risk faced by health workers, who are by nature of their positions required to come into close contact with infectious bodily fluids. Particularly during 2014, healthcare workers were estimated to contribute to 10% of confirmed cases of Ebola, greatly complicating ongoing disease monitoring and treatment efforts.

For Ebola, this includes a mixture of adaptive governance to quickly scale medical response to future outbreaks along with shifting protocols to better protect medical personnel and reduce incidence between the infected and the healthy. One specific example includes adaptive measures at air traffic control, airport security, and passenger biocontainment, which sought to prevent the spread of Ebola within and across affected countries and to neighboring countries. The Center for Disease Control released Guidance on Air Medical Transport (AMT) for patients with active Ebola virus that utilizes a variety of measures to scale against the transmission of the disease to other plane passengers (physicians, nurses, crew, etc.) as well as upon arrival within a new jurisdiction (CDC 2015). Similarly, Massaro et al. (2018) indicate how at-risk populations may be modeled via network science approaches in order to quantify the likely path and virulence of a contagion as well as the various policy mechanisms available to stem its spread. Massaro et al. (2018) conclude that, while a risk-based approach such as the total shutdown of transport within and between affected countries might seem a logical conclusion during an Ebola outbreak, more flexible containment schemes and mitigation policies that seek to mitigate the disruption posed by endemic disease are socially, medically, and economically preferred.",

Virtually every country is connected in a continually growing web of international air travel, which increases the capabilities for new and emerging disease epidemics to jump political borders in a matter of hours. From the perspective of resilience, those managing air traffic are required to maintain anticipated air transportation as much as possible while still preventing the spread of disease. This challenge requires a variety of disease screening at airports along with judgment calls with regard to temporarily shutting down routes into disease heavy regions. Many nations generally responded well to air traffic concerns in West Africa although establishing best practice standards and offering resilient yet efficient measures at the onset of a future outbreak will make disease control efforts all the more effective.",

Such improvements in the physical domain in terms of infrastructure for medical triage and border security will also help frame future improvements to the social, information, and decision-making domains, where a robust physical domain will signal to the general population that the government will take a direct and decisive action in meeting the challenges of the disease and bringing their population back to normalcy.",

In other words, by taking an active stance in offering improvements to the information domain of Ebola resilience, affected countries may help improve the social and cognitive domains by developing trust with the local population and reducing social uncertainty and unfounded fear during the disease recovery process. Without this parallel action, attempts to secure the borders and provide medical treatment will be undermined by distrustful citizen who look for clandestine transportation routes and alternative healing that can actually extend the duration and spread of the epidemic. This is a lengthy process that will require years for those in countries that have experienced a lifetime of war, corruption, and extreme poverty, yet moving in the direction of transparency and effectiveness in disease control may at least begin to reduce disease incidence throughout West and Sub-Saharan Africa.",
