Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time-averaged value and are based on population-level processes. Because many pathogens exhibit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within-host processes to FOI is needed. Specifically, within-host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short-lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual-level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simulations and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population-level FOI signal can be recovered from individual-level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual-level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross-scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual-based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood processes such as secondary infections, in population-level dynamics of disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Wildlife species are a major source of emerging infectious disease (Jones et al. 2008 ) yet our understanding of disease dynamics in wildlife host populations is limited (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ).

Depending on contact rates and susceptibility of other hosts, infectious hosts transmit pathogens to susceptible hosts. Accordingly, recent work addressing the role of within-host dynamics on between-host transmission has revealed the importance of cross-scale insights for understanding and predicting epidemiological outcomes (Handel & Rohani 2015) . Consideration of both scales in the same framework has elucidated how pathogens can circulate persistently under conditions where a single-scale analysis would predict extinction (Kramer-Schadt et al. 2009 ). Multiscale analyses have also improved understanding of phenotypic trade-offs across scales and how they ultimately determine the evolutionary ecology of pathogens (Alizon & van Baalen 2005; Mideo et al. 2008; Handel et al. 2013) ; understanding of the spread of drug-resistant (Handel et al. 2007 ) and viral immune escape mutations Volkov et al. 2010; Park et al. 2013; Schreiber et al. 2016) ; and prediction of how individual-level control methods (e.g. drug regimens) impact epidemic dynamics (Pepin et al. 2013 ).

We summarise and critically evaluate existing methods for estimating FOI and propose a general cross-scale framework that transcends many of the limitations of other methods. For wildlife systems, our proposed method overcomes the following limitations of conventional methods: fine-scaled age data are not required, time-varying FOI can be inferred from short time series of serosurveillance data, rapidly decaying antibody levels are acceptable and effects of individual-level processes in disease dynamics can be examined. We demonstrate using simulations that our individual-level approach can capture populationlevel FOI well from cross-sectional serosurveillance data, even when challenged by substantial individual-level variation and differences in process behaviour, such as antibody decay rate. We also demonstrate the value of individual-level inference in advancing disease ecology practice by applying our approach to a case study of influenza A data collected longitudinally in captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and cross-sectionally in a population of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens). Last, we illustrate how our framework can be applied to additional host-pathogen systems, with complex ecological processes such as variation in route of exposure (e.g. Yersinia pestis in coyotes), and multiple exposures of individuals (e.g. influenza A in mallards).

Ageseroprevalence methods are inappropriate in wildlife-host systems where the host is short-lived (not practical to distinguish ages), where age data are coarse and imprecise (not enough information to fit the age-seroprevalence curve), or where antibodies decay quickly (no signature of increased seroprevalence with age).

A flexible method that relaxes these potentially problematic assumptions (i.e. necessity for age data, reasonably long-lived hosts, slow antibody decay, serial surveillance sampling, or constant FOI over time) remains to be developed and may improve inference of disease dynamics in wildlife systems that often violate one or more assumptions of conventional methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 311, "text": "(Muench 1934", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 312, "end": 326, "text": "(Muench , 1959", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 327, "end": 343, "text": "Farrington 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 344, "end": 361, "text": "Hens et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 889, "end": 914, "text": "(Grenfell & Anderson 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 925, "end": 943, "text": "Heisey et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 371, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 764, "end": 773, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Age-seroprevalence methods"}, {"text": "Age-seroprevalence methods utilise presence/absence data, but the assays used to detect antibodies (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA) typically produce quantitative data.

By considering the underlying quantitative antibody information, the dependence on age data and long-term antibody circulation for inference of FOI can be relaxed. In effect, the historical perspective provided by age data can be replaced with antibody response curves because the decay from peak antibody levels becomes a source of information rather than a nuisance. The main concept is that pathogen-specific antibody kinetics exhibit robust, reproducible patterns, as long as individual-level heterogeneities in antibody response are accounted for appropriately (Simonsen et al. 2009; Teunis et al. 2012 Teunis et al. , 2013 , and thus can be used to infer the time since infection (TSI) for individuals and population incidence (Teunis et al. 2002 (Teunis et al. , 2012 de Melker et al. 2006; Simonsen et al. 2009; Kretzschmar et al. 2010; Borremans et al. 2016) or FOI (Fig. 1b) .

We also compared results using two separate distributions of TSI: Poisson as in Box 1, and negative binomial to allow more flexibility in TSI. The two approaches predicted the same timing of peak FOI, but the geese experimental data predicted FOI with lower precision and the mallard/geese experimental data predicted a slower rise to peak FOI under the negative binomial distribution of mean TSI (Fig. 6 , bottom). We estimated peak seroprevalence in the snow goose population to be c. 0.65 (Fig. 6) . Peak daily incidence was estimated to be c. 0.05-0.18 and peak daily FOI c. 0.09-0.25 (depending on assumptions about the distribution of TSI -Poisson vs. negative binomial, Fig. 6 ), which is consistent with seroconversion rates estimated with the same dataset (Samuel et al. 2015) . The fact that the shape of the epidemic curve differed substantially depending on assumptions about the error structure of the TSI distribution (Poisson vs. negative binomial), suggests future theoretical work may be helpful for refining the general framework we present here. Nonetheless, regardless of the assumption about the error structure underlying the TSI distribution, a similar time of peak FOI was estimated. The quantitative antibody approach suggests an initial rise in FOI towards the end of the nesting period, with peak FOI occuring at the end of the hatching period. The presence of a rise in FOI to an epidemic peak most new offspring are available is consistent with previous studies showing that avian influenza A viruses overwinter on waterfowl breeding grounds in northern latitudes, leading to viral transmission during the breeding season (Ito et al. 1995; Farnsworth et al. 2012; Hill et al. 2016) . Furthermore, snow geese are highly gregarious colony nesting birds, which may promote the transmission and maintenance of density-dependent pathogens (Samuel et al. 2015) such as influenza A viruses and Pasteurella bacteria (Samuel et al. 1999) . Rather than providing a single snapshot of seroprevalence, the quantitative antibody approach infers transmission dynamics throughout the nesting, hatching, and early raising of young phases of the breeding season, demonstrating how quantitative antibody approaches can be applied to advance our understanding of breeding-season transmission dynamics.

The existence of a multitude of factors affecting individual-level variation presents potential challenges in extracting FOI from quantitative serosurveillance data (Gilbert et al. 2013) . To investigate this potential challenge, we generated antibody kinetic and serosurveillance data under different levels of variation in decay rates (Supporting Information 2, and 6). We compared cases where antibody kinetic data had either low, medium or high individual response variation while holding individual variation in serosurveillance data constant at low, medium or high levels and vice versa to produce all combinations of variation for both data types (Supporting Information 6). In our analysis, plots along the diagonal match the model assumption that individual-level variation is similar in both data streams while plots outside the diagonal do not match this assumption. In general, the model performed better under equal levels of variation for both data streams (Fig. 7) , but this was not consistent (e.g. low variation in antibody kinetic data and medium variation in serosurveillance data performed equally well as matching levels of variation; Fig. 7 , top middle). Violation of the equal variation assumption biased results when one of the data streams had high individual-level variation (Fig. 7 , bottom row and right column). In addition, even when the assumption of equal variation was satisfied, high individual-level variation underestimated the timing of peak FOI, although the magnitude was still captured well (Fig. 7 , bottom right). When individual-level variation in the antibody kinetic data was higher than that in serosurveillance data, the model overestimated the timing and magnitude of peak FOI substantially (Fig. 7 bottom, left and middle). Alternatively, when variation in serosurveillance data was substantially higher than that of antibody kinetic data, the timing of peak FOI was underestimated substantially (Fig. 7 , right top and right middle). Overall, our results show that extreme levels of individuallevel variation can lead to poor performance of the model as formulated; especially if the assumption of equal variation between the data streams is not satisfied. Nonetheless, the model performed very well under medium levels of variation that were similar to those quantified in the mallard data, suggesting it is capable of recovering the epidemic signal under realistic conditions.

Previous work has shown that experimental information on assay sensitivity and specificity can be incorporated into models of serosurveillance data, decreasing bias in estimates of prevalence (McClintock et al. 2010) . Likewise, the modelling framework we present is amenable for incorporation of this source of error by modelling it explicitly as a factor affecting the threshold of detection (y*) and/or parameters of the antibody kinetic function, depending on the type of error produced by the assay (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 420, "text": "(Gilbert et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 516, "end": 539, "text": "(Mansfield et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 661, "end": 681, "text": "(Troyer et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 948, "end": 965, "text": "(Bean et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1098, "text": "Plowright et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1317, "text": "(McClintock et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 275, "end": 284, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1614, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Detection"}, {"text": "Epidemiologists studying human diseases have long recognised the importance of accounting for sampling error, often referred to as 'underreporting' or variation in reporting rates (CDC 1996) . Likewise, mechanistic descriptions of sampling error have been deemed important for inference of wildlife disease parameters such as prevalence (McClintock et al. 2010; Bailey et al. 2014) or FOI (Conn et al. 2012) , which were motivated by ecological work accounting for sampling error to provide better inference for unobserved ecological quantities (Williams et al. 2002; Hooten et al. 2007; Royle & Dorazio 2008; Hobbs & Hooten 2015) . Recent work also emphasises that, in addition to sample size and independence between sampled individuals, sampling design should consider underlying seasonality in demographic and disease dynamics to obtain the most accurate estimates of disease transmission parameters (Vinh & Boni 2015) . In systems with seasonality in disease transmission, it is useful to collect the surveillance data over a time scale that captures cycling and make inference over system-specific time intervals (i.e. interval no larger than longevity of antibody response) to decipher temporal heterogeneity in the FOI (Simonsen et al. 2009; Vinh & Boni 2015) . Provided that surveillance is conducted at intervals that capture epidemic cycling and at least some individuals with antibody titres are found, issues from small sample sizes can be attenuated by aggregating data from several sampling events (Blackwood et al. 2013 ). In addition, because each sample generates an individual's epidemiological status (susceptible, newly infected, seropositive for each day of interest in the past), more data can be used for calculating FOI at previous time steps as the sampling period increases, which could increase accuracy of the estimates (e.g. temporal quantitative antibody model we present in Supporting Information 4).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 190, "text": "(CDC 1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 337, "end": 361, "text": "(McClintock et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 362, "end": 381, "text": "Bailey et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 389, "end": 407, "text": "(Conn et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 545, "end": 567, "text": "(Williams et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 568, "end": 587, "text": "Hooten et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 588, "end": 609, "text": "Royle & Dorazio 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 610, "end": 630, "text": "Hobbs & Hooten 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 904, "end": 922, "text": "(Vinh & Boni 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1249, "text": "(Simonsen et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1267, "text": "Vinh & Boni 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1535, "text": "(Blackwood et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Detection"}, {"text": "We considered the situation where a pathogen invades a completely susceptible population, generating a single epidemic peak. Combined with a brief period of sampling, this led to the assumption that expected TSI has the same mean for all individuals, which is inappropriate when there are multiple epidemic peaks or more complicated dynamics occurring within the time frame of the analysis. In the systematic sampling model (Fig. 5, Supporting Information 4) , we relax the equal-mean assumption by allowing mean TSI to vary over time depending on recent antibody levels, which improves inference for samples collected over longer time periods and is important for adapting this framework for systems with endemic dynamics. One important application of our method could be to better understand transmission dynamics in wildlife species, where disease may be inapparent but where knowledge of FOI could inform spillover hazard to other hosts (e.g. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in dromedary camels). Using our framework, inference of timevarying FOI can be made using relatively short-term crosssectional sampling allowing for a more rapid understanding (relative to conventional methods that require long-term sampling to infer time-varying FOI) of the link between recent changes in FOI and spillover hazard. In ongoing work, we are investigating the ability of the model to infer FOI beyond a single epidemic curve to further evaluate the breadth of epidemiological behaviour for which this approach is appropriate. Preliminary findings suggest that allowing more flexibility in the distribution of TSI and/or incorporating longitudinal serosurveillance data may be important for modelling endemic dynamics (Table 1 ; Borremans et al. 2016 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1735, "end": 1756, "text": "Borremans et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 458, "text": "(Fig. 5, Supporting Information 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1732, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Endemic dynamics"}, {"text": "Several pathogens have complex strain structure and cause multiple infections over longer periods of time.

The importance of multiple strains and cross-reaction has been recognised in the study of human influenza A for many years as original antigenic sin (Francis 1960) , the observation that after a vaccination or natural infection during later life, an individual's antibody boost against their first infection may be as strong or stronger than the boost to the current strain. This concept has been revised as antigenic seniority to indicate that second and subsequent early infections may also be important (Lessler et al. 2012) , and incorporated into a life course model of antibody responses to multiple infections in which the number and timing of infections can be inferred (Kucharski et al. 2015) . To account for cross-immunity issues in quantitative antibody methods, it will be important to experimentally measure antibody kinetics for multiple target strains in particular host-pathogen systems, which is a substantial investment of time and money.

While this may be an appropriate approximation in the case of gregarious goose populations congregating at breeding sites, most populations involve some degree of heterogeneity in host contact structure. In general, heterogeneity decreases populationlevel FOI because not all susceptible individuals are in contact with all infectious individuals (as with homogenous mixing). Thus, when applying our framework to populations with heterogeneous contact structure, estimates of FOI could be biased depending on how the population is sampled relative to its contact structure. For example, if only high-degree nodes are sampled, our model may have low bias because this situation is similar to homogenous mixing. Alternatively, if only low degree nodes are sampled our model would underestimate FOI because we would overestimate the number of susceptible individuals that are available for contact with newly infected hosts. Note that bias from contact structure would not affect estimates of incidence in our model because incidence does not rely on estimates of the number of susceptible individuals. Thus, it is safest to infer incidence rather than FOI in highly structured populations where contact structure is unknown.

Recent theoretical advances, extended by the framework presented here, highlight that time-varying estimates of disease incidence or FOI can be obtained by relaxing these requirements, thus providing an inferential tool for epidemic dynamics and other epidemiological situations where conventional methods (i.e. age-seroprevalence methods) are inappropriate. In addition to FOI, quantitative antibody methods can estimate other important quantities of interest, such as the proportion of susceptible hosts, proportion of seropositive hosts and incidence.

Depending on the host response, experimental animals need to be monitored regularly for a potentially long duration (3 months or more) to capture the long-term antibody response profile, which can be expensive and difficult for pathogens that require high level biosecurity. However, a single well-designed experimental study can be used for inference with many serosurveillance datasets and thus is a worthwhile investment. Such studies are specific to the particular hostpathogen system being modelled, thus, for quantitative antibody methods to be broadly applicable, experimental datasets need to be available for a range of host-pathogen systems. An informal survey of the literature revealed that these datasets have been collected in some systems, but the data are rarely presented in a manner that could be used by our model, highlighting a gap for future research.
