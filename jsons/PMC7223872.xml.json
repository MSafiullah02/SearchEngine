Although the first approach to \u201cintensive care\u201d was delivered by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War, and thereafter primarily reserved for postoperative patients or wounded soldiers, the birth of the Intensive Therapy Units began during the polio epidemic in Copenhagen in 1952 [2]. Although polio is now on the brink of eradication thanks to vaccines [3], intensive care medicine has since flourished. Deadly diseases such as smallpox have been completely eradicated or almost, but there are still too many unnecessary deaths due to tetanus, especially neonatal tetanus, in resource-limited countries [4]. Unfortunately, the global proportion of children with adequate vaccination coverage remains insufficient and has not improved in last decade [5].",

A single-centre study in a Chinese paediatric ICU showed that 9.3% of all admissions were due to vaccine-preventable infections [7]. Vaccines are not only highly effective in preventing disease, but are also highly cost-effective and may be cost saving [8]. Implementing vaccines has direct societal benefits, as illustrated by the expansion of a nationwide vaccination program in China which led to drastic decreases in vaccine-preventable diseases in the last 50 years [9]. By decreasing disease incidence, vaccination programmes indirectly lead to decreases in ICU admissions and/or complications, and it is safe to assume that any breach in vaccination programmes indirectly leads to increases in ICU admissions/complications.",

In the pre-vaccination era, Hib was among the leading cause of serious bacterial infection such as meningitis in children and epiglottitis in adolescents, with a 40\u201390% case fatality rate, and a very high proportion (30\u201340%) of neurological sequelae among survivors [14, 15]. Since the Hib conjugated vaccine was introduced in routine immunization schedules in the 1990s, the incidence of Hib infections has dramatically decreased (Fig. 1) [16]. Most of today\u2019s junior paediatricians practicing in high-income countries (HICs) have not seen a case of epiglottitis or Hib meningitis and its sequelae (deafness, death, etc.). Hib was also among the leading causes of invasive infections such as pneumonia, arthritis, sepsis and periorbital cellulitis, which are all rarer nowadays. Remarkably, the overall burden of invasive diseases resulting from non-type b or non-capsulated H. influenzae has remained low and active population-based surveillance has not reported any significant serotype shift following Hib vaccination [15]. Although the uptake of the Hib vaccine was slow in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), all the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) countries have now introduced Hib-containing vaccines in their program through to the Hib Initiative [17], and a significant impact on paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission is expected worldwide.",

            "text": "Following the success of glycoconjugate vaccines against Hib, the same approach was applied to S. pneumoniae. A large observational study on recurrent community-acquired pneumonia has shown that the best predictor of pneumococcal pneumonia is the absence of vaccination, emphasizing its critical importance for prevention [22]. The impact of vaccinating children against S. pneumoniae has exceeded expectations, with a subsequent positive collateral effect on adults\u2019 infection rate and mortality [23]. However, it has induced a shift in the incidence of non-vaccine circulating strains [24]. Thus, it is important to understand the difference between the two currently available types of vaccines: the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) versus the conjugate vaccines (PCVs) [25]. The PPSV23 (Pneumovax23\u00ae, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, US) is composed of purified capsular polysaccharides. Therefore, it induces a mostly non-follicular B cell response with the short-term production of anti-capsular opsonizing immunoglobulins, but no B nor T-cell response; hence, immune memory is not elicited and hyporesponsiveness may be observed after repeat administrations [26]. The PCVs (Synflorix\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK; Prevenar\u00ae, Pfizer, New York, NY, US) were developed subsequently, essentially to protect infants who do not respond to polysaccharides. The pneumococcal polysaccharides are conjugated to a protein carrier, acquiring the capacity to induce both T follicular helper and B-cell responses, thus enabling the development of germinal centre responses, long-lived antibody-secreting cells and memory cells. Another advantage of PCVs is that they induce sufficiently high antibody titres to reduce pneumococcal carriage in vaccinees; unvaccinated contacts are thus indirectly protected from S. pneumoniae transmission and invasive pneumococcal disease through the reduction of circulating invasive serotypes, a brilliant example of community protection [23].",

            "text": "PPSV23 was traditionally recommended for all adults over 65 years, and for individuals older than 2 years with a high-risk medical condition, whereas PCVs are primarily recommended for children aged < 5 years. Despite the fact that PPSV23 induces protection against a larger number of serotypes, experts are less keen to recommend it nowadays, given the absence of memory response and the hyporesponsiveness observed after repeated administrations [26]. Given the superior immunogenicity of PCVs compared to PPSV23, it has been proposed to extend their indication to high-risk adult populations (65 years or older, immunosuppression, chronic diseases). Clinical trials have reported that PCVs elicit equivalent, or even superior, seroresponses than PPSV23 in adults [27, 28], including in immunocompromised hosts [29, 30]. A randomized clinical trial confirmed the protective efficacy of PCV against pneumococcal pneumonia in senior citizens [31]. Recommendations for PCV administration in high-risk adults vary across the world, although they are endorsed by several medical guidelines [29, 32, 33]. Their usefulness depends largely upon the vaccine coverage reached in infants, i.e. the remaining circulation of PCV-serotype in the community.",

The historical differences in yellow fever vaccination (YFV) strategies among African countries have proven at least twice that YFV can eliminate epidemics. A vaccine is available since the 1930s, enabling mass vaccination campaigns in the former French West African colonies, subsequently leading to adequate control of the disease. Routine recommendations for YFV was thus stopped in the 1980s. In the meantime, YF remained endemic in neighbouring former English-speaking African colonies that did not practice vaccination. In 2005, in response to increasing outbreaks in West Africa, the Yellow Fever Initiative was launched to reintroduce YFV into routine child immunization programmes in affected countries, in mass prevention and outbreak-control emergency campaigns. Consequently, epidemics were prevented in West Africa, whilst outbreaks still occurred in central and eastern African countries. An extended YFV strategy was launched in 2016 to improve control of YF all over Africa and worldwide [35]. This resulted into vaccine shortage, fortunately leading to the demonstration that one-fifth of the current vaccine dose could be used in outbreak control [36]. However, YF outbreaks are far from being controlled, vaccine shortages are a real threat and changes in travel patterns, habitations and global warming extend the territories at risk of YF\u2014and thus of an ICU having to admit a patient with YF.",

The first meningococcal vaccine against serogroup C was introduced in the UK in 1999, rapidly demonstrating its highly beneficial impact among infants and toddlers [38]. In 2013, a Men W strain emerged in the UK and subsequently required the introduction of a quadrivalent vaccine (Men A\u2013C\u2013W\u2013Y) in teenagers. In Africa, mass vaccination campaigns started in 2010 against Men A, leading to the control and near elimination of this deadly disease in 26 African countries of the so-called \u201cmeningitis belt\u201d [39]. However, Men W and X persisted, and Men C emerged. Routine immunization with multivalent meningococcal conjugated vaccines could be the answer, would they be produced at an affordable price [40]. In parallel in the UK, a first innovative vaccine against Men B was introduced in infants. After having been shown to be safe [41] and effective in this age group [42], it is now licensed in several countries, but its recommendation varies greatly. Used in 2013 to manage Men B outbreaks in two US universities, it demonstrated the ability to quickly achieve high immunity rates, curbing the outbreak as no new cases occurred among vaccinees [43]. Thus, the development of meningococcal conjugate vaccines has had a significant impact on the incidence of these rare but severe diseases always requiring ICU admission, in which a more widespread use of Men B vaccines could reduce further.",

It remains a serious threat in many LMICs, with large epidemics and up to 50% fatality rate in the absence of effective therapy including aggressive fluid replacement [44]. Parenterally administered killed whole-cell vaccines may be used in HICs, but are not recommended by WHO for global use due to their limited efficacy and short duration of protection [45]. Yet cholera vaccines are game-changers in the fight against epidemics, explaining why the Global Task Force on Cholera Control included them in its eradication strategy [46]. Rapidly effective, oral cholera vaccines also induce a measurable community protection effect for non-vaccinated individuals [47]. Modelling studies suggest that vaccinating 50% of a population may result in a greater than 90% reduction in the incidence of cholera [48]; even a lower coverage of 30% may result in a 76% reduction in the disease incidence. Thus, the use of cholera vaccines in epidemic areas is predicted to be both life-saving and cost-effective [49].",

First identified in the 1970s, Ebola viruses are responsible for a frequently-fatal haemorrhagic fever disease. Their spread from Central to Western Africa led to a devastating outbreak between 2013 and 2016 [50]. Although initially delayed, the response strategy of the health community-integrated Phase I vaccination trials at an unprecedented pace. As a result, Phase I [51] and Phase II/III [52] trials of a new vectored Ebola virus vaccine candidate (rVSV-ZEBOV) were initiated only 5 months apart. The phase III African trial used an innovative design of ring vaccination strategy. Clusters (rings) of adults who were contacts (or contacts of contacts) of an Ebola disease index case were randomized 1:1 to vaccination, either immediately or 3 weeks later. After preliminary analysis by an independent safety monitoring board, randomization was stopped and immediate vaccination offered to all eligible: vaccine efficacy was 100% and the epidemic, which was already declining, was rapidly brought under control. This successful experience demonstrated how research can be accelerated in short delays when adequately supported/funded and appropriately championed. It also showed that clinical trials can be rapidly performed during outbreaks and could play a critical role in ending ongoing epidemics [50]. However, the use of rVSV-ZEBOV in response to a new epidemic that emerged in Democratic Republic of Congo at the end of 2017 and is not yet under control in September 2019 reminds us that even the most potent vaccines (> 97% estimated efficacy) must be administered timely to be effective [53].",

However, as protection requires complete coverage of all contacts, cocooning is difficult to implement effectively. Antenatal maternal vaccination (first introduced in the UK in 2013) is the most efficient strategy against infant death from pertussis and has proven safe [58]. As maternofoetal antibody transfer requires high antibody concentration in the mothers and an active transfer across the placenta, maternal vaccination during the second trimester of pregnancy optimally protects infants during the highest risk period [59, 60]. Regrettably, aP vaccines are currently cost-prohibitive for many LMICs [61], although initiatives are ongoing to develop affordable aP vaccines for use during pregnancy.",

The disease typically presents as a painful unilateral vesicular dermatomal rash and results from the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus located in sensory ganglia, usually decades after primary infection. To prevent post-herpetic neuralgia, which can significantly impact the quality of life for years, a first live-attenuated zoster vaccine was licensed for use in senior citizens in 2006 (Zostavax\u00ae, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, US). The vaccine is significantly more potent that the one licensed to prevent chickenpox and, therefore, boosts T-cell-mediated immunity, which is essential to prevent viral reactivation. As this vaccine is contra-indicated in immunosuppressed patients, it is mostly not useful in ICU. However, recently, a novel glycoprotein-based adjuvanted vaccine (Shingrix\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) has proven to be extremely effective and safe even in older adults [62, 63]. Several ongoing studies are currently assessing its immunogenicity in various groups of immunosuppressed patients. Should its efficacy be maintained, it could become a cornerstone of the patient preparation prior to any elective ICU admission (i.e. prior to surgery) to prevent shingles.",

As their large-scale use resulted into a > 99% decline in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, a growing number of people are questioning their safety as well as the need for vaccination. Initially limited to small numbers of individuals with mostly philosophical or religious-based convictions, vaccine hesitancy (defined as \u201ca delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services\u201d), is gaining ground and threatening community protection. Reasons underlying this tendency, and ways to respond to it, have been nicely reviewed recently [13]. Causes of increasing mistrust in vaccination are multiple. Given their high effectiveness, vaccine-preventable diseases progressively disappear from the community and collective history. The benefits of vaccination have become less obvious, whereas the smallest risks remain observable (Fig. 2). Other factors include fear or mistrust of Big Pharma and medical/government authorities, growing interest in \u201cnatural medicine\u201d, fear of injections, and false perceptions such as the risk of overloading the infants\u2019 immune system. The Internet and social networks have facilitated this movement, anti-vaccine materials being more easily accessible/diffused than scientific vulgarized information [13].",

These are more frequent in infants, adolescents, adults, and among immune-suppressed individuals in whom measles-attributable fatality rate is up to 70% [66]. Importantly, measles induces general immunosuppression, including lymphopenia, suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (e.g. tuberculin challenge test), impairment of both dendritic cells functions and lymphocytes proliferative responses to new antigens [67, 68], as well as a decreased accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils into the spleen, resulting in a lower ability to clear secondary bacterial infections [69]. It leads to a high frequency of secondary infections which all together are responsible for a high disease burden in LMICs [65, 70].

In the 1990s, investigators from the UK suggested that measles-mumps-rubella vaccination could lead to inflammatory bowel disease and autism [11]. All subsequent studies were unable to replicate these findings [76], and well-conducted epidemiologic studies failed to demonstrate such associations [77]. In the 2010s, an investigative review found that the UK medical records had been purposefully incorrectly abstracted to falsely implicate the vaccine [78], leading the editors to subsequently retract the original article [79]. The principal investigator [11] lost his license to practise medicine but is still leading an anti-vaccine movement. Although all the evidence refutes the hypothesis that measles-containing vaccines contribute to inflammatory bowel disease and autism, this initial suspicion has a sustained dramatic effect on the population\u2019s beliefs and subsequent vaccination coverage worldwide [80]. Consequently, intensive care physicians should remain alert to the eventuality of having to admit a patient with measles, a diagnosis which may be missed or delayed as disease incidence declines. Furthermore, lack of recognition or appropriate infection control measures -airborne precautions- might lead to subsequent nosocomial transmission among both patients and caregivers.",

As influenza viruses undergo recurrent genetic and surface antigens antigenic changes, the influenza vaccine needs to be continually adapted to the circulating strains and vaccination repeated annually to ensure protection. With a vaccine efficacy ranging from 8 to 91%, influenza vaccines do not meet the expectations of vaccinologists, health authorities nor healthcare workers (HCWs). Nevertheless, annual vaccination campaigns of subjects at risks of complications or transmission are still considered as the most efficient preventive strategy against seasonal epidemics, and occasional pandemics, both associated with significant disease burden and costs [81].",

HCWs are at increased risk of influenza exposure/infection and play an important role in spreading the virus during hospital outbreaks, as transmission can occur before symptoms. The number (of HCWs) needed to vaccinate to ensure a benefit to one patient ranges from 3 to 50 [83]. This benefit is most obvious in long-term care facilities hosting high-risk elderly patients. It is estimated that 60% of infections could be prevented if all HCWs in these settings were vaccinated [83]. However, acceptance of annual influenza vaccination is challenging. A systematic review showed that the strongest motivation for HCWs to get vaccinated was to protect themselves (or their families), and not their patients [83]; the strongest barriers against vaccination were lack of confidence about disease severity or vaccine effectiveness, concerns about vaccine safety, and lack of professional or ethical obligation to get vaccinated. A high level of misinformation on influenza disease and vaccination exists [84]. As a result, influenza vaccine coverage remains alarmingly low among HCWs in nearly all European countries but is generally high in Canada, US, Japan, and Australia\u2014wherever institutional pressure is applied [85]. As HCWs should be role models in promoting vaccination, their hesitancy impacts the beliefs of the rest of the population. Correcting misinformation and strongly recommending the vaccines is essential, as is free and easy access to the vaccine. Mandatory vaccination remains the most successful intervention to increase vaccine uptake but is frequently not acceptable or feasible. \u201cSoft-mandate\u201d including opt-out programs, such as requiring mask use during the whole flu season for those who decline vaccination, may be an acceptable alternative [83].",

Guidelines also include recommendations for vaccination of household members of immunocompromised patients. Improvement in patient care could result from simply informing a patient and anticipating a personalised administration schedule, which can be pointed out on the discharge letter, and updating vaccinations should be the matter of all. Discharge from critical care is probably an appropriate timing for immunization since near-death/life-threatening experience increases the awareness of disease-risk and acceptance of preventive interventions, such as vaccination. Although altered immune function, including lymphocyte depletion, is well-documented after septic injury [90\u201392] and reduces vaccine-responses in mice [93], the nature and magnitude of this \u201cimmunoparalysis\u201d differ over time and between patients [94] and its impact on vaccine responses is unknown.

Vaccine recommendations differ according to lymphocyte count (CD4 counts of \u2265 or < 200 cells/mm3 in adults and \u2265 or < 15% CD4 T-lymphocyte percentage). CTX: during chemotherapy. After CTX: 3 months after chemotherapy or 6 months after anti-B-cell antibodies, patients should be vaccinated according to the routine vaccination schedule. Vaccines administered during cancer chemotherapy should not be considered valid doses unless there is documentation of a protective antibody level. Before HSCT: before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, candidate should be updated with their vaccination according to routine schedule. Live-attenuated vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks and inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks before starting the conditioning regimen. After HSCT: after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients should be fully re-immunized with more vaccine doses than for immunocompetent. Before SOT: before solid organ transplantation, candidate should be updated with their vaccination according to routine schedule. Live-attenuated vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks before transplantation. After SOT: after solid organ transplantation, recipient should be updated with inactivated vaccine according to routine schedule. Live-attenuated vaccines could be used with caution if patient is seronegative, clinically stable on low immunosuppression, after assessment of risk and benefits, with close follow-up and appropriate education of the patient and its primary care physician [115]. Inflammatory diseases: vaccine recommendations for patients with inflammatory diseases depend on the level of immunosuppression, whether it is planned, low-level or high-level. Low-level immunosuppression includes treatment with prednisone < 2 mg/kg with a maximum of \u2264 20 mg/day; methotrexate \u2264 0.4 mg/kg/week; azathioprine \u2264 3 mg/kg/day; or 6-mercaptopurine \u2264 1.5 mg/kg/day. High-level immunosuppression regimens include treatment with doses higher than those listed for low-dose immunosuppression and biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor antagonists or rituximab. Asplenia or SCD: patients with asplenia or sickle cell disease should be continuously vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria. Influenza vaccination is essential given the high risk of pneumococcal infection following influenza. Cochlear implants or CSF leak: patients with profound hearing loss have or are scheduled to receive a cochlear implant, have an inner ear-cerebrospinal fluid communication or other sort of cerebrospinal fluid leak should be vaccinated against pneumococcus C recommended in certain conditions (see Rubin et al. [89] for details, and Suresh et al. [115] for the latest recommendation on MMR and VZV after SOT), CSF cerebrospinal fluid, CTX chemotherapy, DTP diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, H highly recommended, some patients will require more doses and/or higher dosage than immunocompetent person, HAV hepatitis A vaccine, HBV hepatitis B vaccine, Hib Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; HIV human immunodeficiency virus, HPV human papillomavirus vaccine, HSCT hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, IIV inactivated influenza vaccine, IPV inactivated poliovirus vaccine, LAIV live-attenuated influenza vaccine, MEN meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MMR measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, MMRV measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella\u2013varicella vaccine, NO not recommended, PCV pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PPSV pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, R highly recommended (patient is at increased risk), ROT rotavirus vaccine, SCD sickle cell disease, SOT solid organ transplantation, U recommended as usually (in routine vaccination of immunocompetent person), VZV varicella vaccine, ZV zoster vaccine",
