It is a fact that the typical de novo drug discovery program takes 10\u201315 years [3,4] from the identification of lead molecule to market the drug and the probability of success rate is less than 10% [5]. Over five years, the number of new drugs approved by FDA has been around 40 per year, although billions of US dollars spent by various pharma industries on the research and development [[6], [7], [8]]. The success rate is less than 6% of new drug discovery and development, which is far away from addressing an unmet clinical need for disease treatments. Because, the effective therapeutics for complex diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), cardiovascular diseases, and neglected diseases are still lacking. This outcome strongly suggests that new strategies, approaches, and technologies are needed to accelerate drug discovery to advance the success rate of drug development.",

It is a drug discovery program, which is faster and safer to develop medications against diseases/disorders for which no potential treatment is available. In recent years, the success rate of drug repurposing approach accounts for approximately 30% of the newly FDA approved drugs, and vaccines. This is one of the main reasons for pharmaceutical companies to show their interest in drug repurposing approach. This approach does not require the initial six to 10 years typically needed for the development of new drugs. Additionally, many phases of de novo drug discovery and development can be by-passed, since clinical and pre-clinical studies of the re-purposed candidates are already being documented in the original indication(s). Thus, it reduces the time and cost needed to reach the market and risk intrinsic to any research and development program. Moreover, the risk of clinical failure is also low. As an added advantage, this approach gives a possibility to widen the market and to prolong the application of the patent life of a drug. There are mainly two ways to proceed drug-repositioning approach such as experimental strategies and computational strategies.",

These approaches are proven economic in discovering novel therapeutic ligands.

Therefore, targeting tyrosinase has been recognized as a potential approach for controlling the abnormal production of melanin. Tyrosinase is also an important target in the food industry as inhibition of tyrosinase can prevent the enzymatic browning of fruits and vegetables. Besides, it essential for wound healing process and immune responses in many plants, sponges and some invertebrates. Abnormal activities of tyrosinase have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's [19] and Huntington's diseases [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]].",

For example, ethionamide (2), a second-line antituberculosis drug used for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, shares a chemical similarity that led to the discovery of a new mushroom tyrosinase inhibitor with an IC50 value of 4.0 \u03bcM. Other commercially available analogs of 2 including, prothionamide (3), thioisonicotinamide (4), pyridine-3-carbothiomide (5), pyridine-2-carbothiomide (6), and thiobenzamide (7) were identified as potent tyrosinase inhibitors. In particular, compound 7 had a strong inhibitory activity than other molecules, which suggests that the pyridine ring in compound 2 can be replaced by other aromatic moieties, including a benzene ring. However, the poor inhibitory activity of isoniazid (8), a first-line antituberculosis drug, suggests that carbothiomide group was crucial for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Moreover, comparing the inhibitory activities of drugs 2 and 3 implies that the additional aliphatic tail was not required for inhibiting the tyrosinase. Inhibitory kinetic studies suggest that drug 2, and its analogs 3\u20137 were reversible and non-competitive. In cellular assay, drugs 6 and 7 markedly decreased the melanin content in B16 cells to the values of 44% and 37%, respectively, without inducing any cytotoxicity up to 50 \u03bcM concentration. Further studies suggest that the drug 7 had strong inhibition of mammalian tyrosinase. However, the inhibition exhibited by drug 2, and its analogs were weaker than those obtained by PTU observed in enzyme, and melanin content assays.",

Thioacetazone (9) (also called as thiacetazone) is an anti-tuberculosis drug [31]. Ambazone (10) is an oral antiseptic drug used in Europe [32]. The other five molecules (11\u201315) are antithyroid drugs [33]. These drugs, except 12, exhibited remarkable inhibitory activities against mushroom tyrosinase (see IC50 values of each in Fig. 1), although they were comparatively weaker than 1 (1 \u03bcM). Kinetics studies of tyrosinase inhibition assigned these thiourea-containing drugs as non-competitive inhibitors. In cellular assay, using B16 cells, drug 10 among other thioureas, significantly decreased the melanin content by 20% without inducing any cytotoxicity up to 20 \u03bcM. Further, enzymatic studies with cell extracts of B16F10 cells confirmed that thiourea-containing drugs affected the function of mammalian tyrosinase.",

It inhibited tyrosinase activity with a Ki value of 52 \u03bcM. In addition to that, two other thiopurine drugs such as mercaptopurine (17) and azathioprine (18) were discovered as tyrosinase inhibitors, and among them, drug 17 showed stronger Ki value (Ki 52 \u03bcM) than the drug 16. Azathioprine (18) exhibited a poor tyrosinase inhibition. These results suggest that the sulfur atom possibly plays an important role in the interaction of tyrosinase. Interestingly, thioinosine (19), a metabolic product of mercaptopurine through the attachment of sugar moiety exhibited an excellent tyrosinase inhibitory activity with a Ki value of 8.0 \u03bcM. Further, kinetics studies classified the drugs 16, 17, and 19 as competitive inhibitors. In the cellular assay, these drugs inhibited the melanin content without cytotoxicity up to 50 \u03bcM.

For the first time, Gasic and co-workers reported the possible role of aspirin in cancer therapy. They discovered that the antiplatelet activity of 20 in tumor-bearing mice was associated with a 50% reduction in lung metastasis [40]. A recent study also indicated that the daily intake of the drug 20 (75 mg) produced a significant beneficial effect against gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic, brain, prostate, and lung cancer [41]. The mode of action aspirin is reported to modulate numerous molecules, which are associated with the tumorigenesis process [42]. Preclinical studies revealed that the anticancer activity of drug 20 has been attributed by its inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that promotes carcinogenesis through the synthesis of prostaglandins (PG), including PGE2 [43]. Besides, drug 20 was reported to inhibit the activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is critical to regulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis [44]. In a study reported by Li Ling et al. compound 20 not only inhibited proliferations and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells, but also delayed and overcame acquired resistance to targeted therapy. The underlying mechanism could be attributed to enhanced cancer stemness and activated NF-kB signaling in acquired resistant tumors were suppressed by aspirin and rendered resistant tumors more sensitive to aspirin than parental, sensitive cells in terms of proliferation, apoptosis and cancer stemness. On the contrary, aspirin has no effects on normal lung and mammary epithelial cell proliferation at concentrations used on lung and breast cancer cells. Hence, aspirin could be a potential candidate for combination therapy for lung and breast cancers [45]. Other studies suggest that the anticancer property of aspirin (20) has been linked to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. While numerous studies suggest the potent anticancer activities of drug 20, the overall benefit is limited as it is associated with serious side effects including the gastrointestinal and renal toxicities. Therefore, there is no clear recommendation to take 20 for population-wide use. On the other hand, as a primary cancer prevention tool, many reports revealed using 20 would have a greater benefit in the population at age 40\u201385. Thus, U.S. preventive services task force recommendation statement (USPSTF), recommended for daily intake of 20 for patients above 40 years with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer.",

The molecular mechanism of metformin involves the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-induced protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme regulating cellular metabolism. Rapamycin (mTOR), a gene that is involved in the survival of cancer cells is negatively regulated by AMPK. Metformin is also able to reduce the signals of mTOR by inhibiting Rag-mediated activation of mTOR [58]. In general, diabetic patients have an increased risk of several cancer types; especially diabetic women have a 20% risk of developing breast cancer. Several studies suggested the anticancer property of drug 24. The drug 24 at the dose of 250\u2013500 mg/day has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer as well as its daily dose reduces the incidence of gastrological cancer in patients with diabetes [59,60]. Several reviews and meta-analysis suggests that taking drug 24 was associated with reduced risk of all cancer mortality in patients with diabetes [61]. In a recent meta-analysis of several anti-diabetic drugs, it was found that the patients using drug 24 had an overall reduced risk of cancer and decreased mortality rate by 14 and 30%, respectively. Whereas, the use of insulin was associated with an increased risk of cancer and mortality. The recent phase 3 clinical trial studies using the occurrence of colorectal adenomas as a biomarker for cancer as a primary endpoint at 1 year after intervention revealed that metformin reduced both occurrence and number of adenomas/polyps in the patients at low dosage level.",

However, relatively high doses of statins are required to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, increasing the risk of myopathy, the most common adverse efect associated with statins. This makes it desirable to identify drugs which reduce the dose of pitavastatin necessary to treat cancer. A drug-repositioning strategy was employed to identify suitable candidates. Screening a custom library of 100 of-patent drugs for synergistic activity with pitavastatin identifed prednisolone (35) as the most prominent hit. Prednisolone potentiated the activity of pitavastatin in several assays measuring the growth, survival or apoptosis in several ovarian cancer cells lines. Prednisolone, alone or in some cases in combination with pitavastatin, reduced the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, providing a mechanistic explanation for the synergy pitavastatin inhibited the growth of tested cell lines with an IC50 ranging from 1.1 to 4.8 \u03bcM. Therefore, clinical trials of prednisolone with pitavastatin in patients with ovarian cancer may be highly warranted.",

However, no drugs targeting the Wnt pathway exist on the market nor in advanced clinical trials. Very recently, Ahmed et al. have provided a comprehensive body of preclinical evidence that an anti-leprotic drug clofazimine (36) is effective against TNBC [85]. Clofazimine specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in a panel of TNBC cells in vitro. For example, an IC50 of 6 \u03bcM and 7 \u03bcM was exhibited in HEK293T and BT-20 cells respectively. In several mouse xenograft models of TNBC, clofazimine efficiently suppresses tumor growth, correlating with in vivo inhibition of the Wnt pathway in the tumors. Clofazimine is well compatible with doxorubicin, exerting additive effects on tumor growth suppression, producing no adverse effects. Its excellent and well-characterized pharmacokinetics profile, lack of serious adverse effects at moderate (yet therapeutically effective) doses, its combinability with cytotoxic therapeutics, and the novel mechanistic mode of action make clofazimine a prime candidate for the repositioning clinical trials. Our work may bring forward the anti-Wnt targeted therapy, desperately needed for thousands of patients currently lacking targeted treatments.",

This MM is associated with a variety of genetic and epigenetic events (namely aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and phosphorylation, actin, and non-coding RNA expression) as well as deregulation of various signaling pathways that regulate DNA repair, RNA editing, protein homeostasis. These epigenetic events have been associated with abnormal signaling by dysregulation of critical pathways controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and drug resistance. Catalano, Raffaella, et al. recently reported anti-tumor activity of hydroxychloroquine (37), derivative of chloroquine and an anti-malarial agent also known as autophagy inhibitor). They demonstrated that 37 inhibits the allosteric binding of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to catalytic subunit (EED) within the lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) binding pocket and thereby antagonizing the PRC2 catalytic activity [86].",

They all were able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV in the low micromolar range. In addition to that, all four drugs inhibited SARS-CoV as well as human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, which suggests that they could be used for broad-spectral anti-viral activity. As a mode of action, drug 39 inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 3.0 \u03bcM through the blockade of the virus at a very early stage. Chloroquine was previously reported as an effective anti-viral agent against flavivirus, influenza virus, HIV [99], Ebola virus [100], and Nipha-Hendra virus [101]. Chlorpromazine (40) was another hit compound resulted from the screening and inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC50 of 4.9 \u03bcM. It is the first antipsychotic drug developed for the treatment of schizophrenia [102], and mechanistically it inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It has also been reported to inhibit the replication of hepatic C virus (HCV) [103], alphavirus [104], mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2) [105], and another coronavirus SARS-CoV [106]. The mechanistic study of drug 40 on MERS-CoV indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage, suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism. Loperamide (41), an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist, which reduces the intestinal motility [107], inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV. Additionally, it inhibited the other two coronaviruses in low micromolar range (4\u20136 \u03bcM). Lopinavir (42) is an anti-HIV protease inhibitor, which also inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC50 of 8.0 \u03bcM. It was previously reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro) [108], and therefore, it was presumed that it might also target the Mpro of MERS-CoV.",

Although the results showed that they were safe in patients with acute dengue, drugs failed to meet prior\u2013defined trial endpoints [[112], [113], [114], [115], [116]]. Besides, two clinical trials conducted in Thailand and Singapore involving ivermectin (54) and ketotifen (55), the preliminary result was quite promising as phase 2 study of the drug 54 suggested a reduction in serum NS1 levels and body temperature [117].",

They both significantly prolonged atrioventricular conduction time in Langendorff-isolated rat hearts, and showed inhibitory activity of Ba2+ current through Cav1.2 channels. Compound 75 showed interesting activity against PfPMT, which could be an important starting point for the identification of more potent inhibitors active against both sexual and asexual stages of the parasite.",

Moreover, docking profile and pharmacogenomics evaluations depicted that out of 36 only five drugs were most active and showed good results compared to other drugs. The MD simulation results exposed that these five drugs (Risperidone, Domperidone, Verapamil, Tamsulosin and Cinitapride) showed better profiles with respect to their RMSD, RMSF, SASA and Rg evaluations graphs and steady stable behavior in all docking complexes. In-vitro AChE inhibition assay of the above best-screened drugs were performed by spectrophotometric method using acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate. The enzyme inhibition and kinetic mechanism of these drugs showed that Cinitapride (79) has good therapeutic potential with respect to standard and other drugs. It is well known that, Cintapride (79) is a gastroprokinetic agent and antiulcer agent of the benzamide class [142]. It is an agonist of 5-HT1 and 5-HT4 receptors and as an antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptors [143]. Based on aforementioned results, it is justified that Cinitapride has better repositioning profile which may be used in the treatment of AD after clinical assessment.",

However, there is an unfortunate disconnect between in vivo and clinical studies, as no formal studies to provide direct clinical evidence have so far been conducted on any of the most promising candidates.",

Most of the drugs in this class have good blood-brain barrier penetration and induces cerebral vasodilatation, increased cerebral blood flow in animals and humans [153]. In vitro studies have revealed that certain CCBs reduce A\u03b2 production, oligomerization, and accumulation, rescue A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity, and improve cell survival in the presence of A\u03b2 [[154], [155], [156]]. CCBs have also been shown to reduce glutamate-induced cell death and levels of intracellular calcium [157]. The ability of CCBs to prevent A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 production was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) by Paris et al. and Iwasaki et al. In that study, amlodipine (86) and nilvadipine (87) (Fig. 7) were identified as the only agents that inhibited A\u03b2 production [158]. However, the concentrations studied were several-fold higher than can be achieved therapeutically.",

This was confirmed in an AbO-induced mouse model, where the AbO-mediated memory impairment was abolished by a its pretreatment. Although AbOs induce memory impairment through glial activation, assessing the anti-inflammatory action of 96, we found that in both the AbO-treated and APP/PS1 mice, the memory recovery was associated with a lower neuroinflammation.

Further, potential mechanism of action of retinoids may include the upregulation of enzymes involved in amyloid clearance such as insulin-degrading enzyme [172] and components of the APOE pathway [170]. Retinoids may also induce potentially beneficial changes related to insulin signaling and increased neurogenesis and promote neuronal differentiation of progenitor cells [173,174]. Retinoids also act as antioxidants (by regulating SOD and inhibiting glutathione depletion to reduce mitochondrial damage) as well as anti-inflammatory agents (by reducing the production of IL-6) in vitro. Both of these activities have potential importance in AD pathology [175,176]. Therefore, there was a strong mechanistic rationale for the potential benefit of retinoid therapies beyond amyloid modulation, but there is a need to further clarify the impact of treatment on these pathways through in vivo studies. Overall, studies in the literature indicate that retinoids have strong potential mechanistic plausibility as therapies for AD owing to their effects on APP processing, A\u03b2 clearance, insulin signaling, and neurogenesis. Out of the approved drugs, data for bexarotene have provided proof of concept as potential candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as noted above, whereas acitretin (93, Fig. 7), which is known to penetrate tissues including brain may also be a promising candidate for AD [177].",

As of 2015, PD affected 6.2 million individuals, of which 117400 people died. It usually occurs people over the age of 60, of whom about one percent are affected. In addition to the classic motor symptoms caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons, Parkinson's disease encompasses a wide range of nonmotor symptoms. Although novel disease-modifying medications that slow or stop Parkinson's disease progression are being developed, drug repurposing, which is the use of existing drugs that have passed numerous toxicity and clinical safety tests for new indications, can be used to identify treatment compounds. This strategy has revealed that tetracyclines (96) are promising candidates for the treatment of Parkinson's disease [178]. Tetracyclines, which are neuroprotective, inhibit proinflammatory molecule production, matrix metalloproteinase activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding/aggregation, and microglial activation. Two commonly used semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline derivatives, minocycline.",

In addition, we examine the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory activities of tetracyclines regulate inflammasome signaling.

This drug 88 came into medical use in the year 1989. Epidemiological data support that calcium channel blockers may have the potential to reduce the risk of developing PD. Among dihydropyridines, drug 88 has attracted very much as it inhibits the subtype Cav1 Ca2+ channels Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, which are most likely mediate the risk in PD. Moreover, the good brain bioavailability of drug 88 has made it the most promising candidate for repurposing [178,179]. Studies have shown that drug 88 dose repentantly protect the dopaminergic neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced toxicity by reverting dopaminergic neurons to a latent juvenile pacemaking mechanism independent of calcium [180,181]. An open-label, dose-escalation study assessing safety (STEADY-PD) of drug 88 controlled release 5\u201320 mg/day in patients with early PD suggested that the acceptable tolerability at doses of \u226410 mg per day; however at higher doses caused leg edema and dizziness [182]. Isradipine (88) with 10 mg being the highest dosage was again confirmed in another STEADY-PD-II, a randomized, double-blinded trial, which was undertaken in 99 subjects with early PD not requiring dopaminergic therapy [183]. Results suggest that the most common adverse effect was peripheral edema, which occurred in 34% of patients receiving drug 88 (10 mg). Placebo-controlled phase III clinical study to assess the efficacy of drug 88 (10 mg daily) as a disease-modifying agent in early PD was completed in November 2018 [184]. The study recruited 336 patients with early PD not requiring dopaminergic therapy and followed them prospectively for 36 months, with the primary outcome designated as a change in the unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I-III score as measured in the ON state. The results are expected in the middle of 2019. In animal models, drug 88 reported with neuroprotection effect in a dose-dependent manner, higher doses confirmed better protection.",

It has been shown to have neuroprotective roles by elevating the level of serum urate, a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenging property with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis. Many studies suggest that individuals with increased levels of urate in serum have a reduced risk of developing PD, as well as in patients with PD are associated with a reduced rate of disease progression. Moreover, in toxin-based models of PD, increased urate levels have conferred protection against dopaminergic cell death stimulated by MPTP, 6-OHDA, and rotenone. Akt-GSK-3B signaling and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-like 2 (Nrf2) were thought to involve in these effects. Therefore, given the data supporting a neuroprotective role of urate, inosine has been repurposed in the pathogenesis of PD. The ability to raise urate level of drug 88 in serum was demonstrated in SURE-PD, a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled in 75 patients with early PD not yet requiring any medication. The results showed that inosine raised the mild urate level (6.1\u20137.0 mg/dl) or moderate urate elevation (7.1\u20138.0 mg/dl) after 25 months and well-tolerated with favorable progression rate in UPDRS score, which amounted to \u223c1 point per year on the total UPDRS scale. On the other hand, the elevated level of urate in serum have the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke over the long term. These side effects are potentially limiting its utility in older patients with PD. However, in patients of Asian origin with PD, inosine elevated urate levels (6.1\u20137.0 mg/dl) without side effects after 1 year of treatment was reported. The multicenter SURE-PD3 trial, which involves a large number of patients (240 patients), is currently underway intending to elevate the urate level to 7.1\u20138.0 mg/dl. The result of the study will be expected in the year 2020.",

            "text": "\nNilotinib (95, Fig. 7) is a selective c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Accumulating evidence suggests that c-Abl activation has been linked in the pathogenesis of PD and other synucleinopathies. Activated (phosphorylated) c-Abl has been found in a high level in post-mortem studies of patients with PD [193,194]. It was also reported that activation of c-Abl in mice induces neurodegeneration in the hippocampal and striatal brain areas [195]. Continuous work has demonstrated that c-Abl phosphorylation occurs as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress [196], which can promote the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in through effects on autophagy mechanisms [195] and can further promote phosphorylation of parkin, causing inhibition of its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal death [194]. All the above evidences propose that c-Abl may be a promising therapeutic target in the management of PD. The CNS penetration of nilotinib over other Abl inhibitors has favored it to fetch more data in PD related studies. Indeed, in preclinical models of PD, drug 92 has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and reduces c-Abl activity, ameliorating autophagic clearance of \u03b1-synuclein in transgenic and lentiviral gene-transfer models [195]. More importantly, these effects were seen at doses far lower (1\u201310 mg/kg/day) than those used to treat CML, which is considered as the key characteristics for potential drug repurposing. Furthermore, nilotinib prevented dopaminergic cell loss and motor impairments induced by MPTP in mice, which were associated with inhibition of parkin phosphorylation and reduced accumulation of parkin substrate PARIS, thus hinting at another potential mechanism of action [197,198]. Based on these preclinical data, a small, open-label proof-of-concept study was recently conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nilotinib in 12 patients with PD dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies followed-up for 24 weeks, followed by a final assessment 12 weeks later [199]. The necessary lowest choice of dose for the clinical study was taken as 150\u2013300 mg. The authors reported that nilotinib was well tolerated, though one patient receiving 300 mg was diagnosed with myocardial infarction, and two had transient QTc prolongations. There was also evidence of CNS penetration with nilotinib CSF plasma ratio of 12 and 15% with 300 and 150 mg, respectively. Due to numerous methodological limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution [200]. Due to unwanted off-target nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibition; side effects of nilotinib at doses used to treat CML include cardiac conduction abnormalities. Therefore, claims of tolerability should be interpreted with caution. Indeed, the effects on efficacy was also highly impossible to be concluded. Besides, it was also reported in the CSF, none of the markers used were validated as biomarkers in PD; they can also vary greatly between patients and track poorly with disease stage and progression. This situation again raises questions about the optimum dose of nilotinib, its brain penetrance, assessments of cardiovascular effects in patients.",

Sex specific treatment options may thus be proposed, with non-feminizing agents (raloxifene, DHEA, progesterone, dutasteride) for men. Indeed, the SERMs, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors and DHEA are alternatives to estrogens and could be used for both men and women. In the current trend to develop personalized medicine, estrogens could be used in priority for women. Because a variety of estrogens and progestins are available and clinically used, additional studies are needed to optimize the formulation of these agents, timing of initiation and duration of treatment to provide a beneficial therapeutic approach on PD risk and symptoms management [201].",

Unlike NCEs, all re-purposed molecules possess all required safety, preclinical and efficacy data enables the investigator to make an informed decision at much earlier stage of drug development substantially reduces the costs, time and efforts required for successfully bringing a repositioned drug to the market.

It is still a big hurdle/uphill task in utilizing repurposed drug candidates for human use. In general, a repurposing candidate carries a potential time risk because it has failed previously for a pre-intended indication. Hence, it is advisable to design a branched development program, in which the lead compound is evaluated for several indications simultaneously. Drug repurposing requires thorough comprehension of biological and molecular pathways that a drug can modulate as well as its interactions with endogenous bio-molecules in order for a successful repurposing of that drug molecule. When repurposing a drug for rare and neglected diseases, there is no assurance that the economic returns will be substantial as expected for a pharmaceutical company. Lack of financial incentives and research funding is another challenge for pharmaceutical companies. Problems in clinical trials: chance of failure of proof of studies for new indications as well as limited availability of volunteers for large clinical studies in case of rare diseases due to scarcity of patients. Intellectual property related issues hinder the commercialization of repositioned molecule.",

The drugs listed above are only a few of plenty drugs that can be repurposed in various therapies. The drugs discussed in the perspective are summarized in Table 1\nand compared to the previous uses of each drug with the repurposed use. The opportunities for drug repurposing are diverse, but a lot still has to be done for its exploration. Drug repurposing or drug repositioning offers a new strategy to academic centers, research council programs, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug development. The main advantage of drug repurposing is the established safety of the known candidate compounds when compared to that of the development of novel therapeutic compounds. The time and cost required to advance a candidate into clinical trials can be substantially reduced because in vitro and in vivo screening, chemical optimization, toxicity studies, bulk manufacturing, and formulation development have already been completed in many cases, and can, therefore, be bypassed. Moreover, these drugs have been on the market for many years, and consequently, the side effects are already known, and safety is therefore very high. For medicinal chemists, the repurposing of drugs on cancer is a rewarding job for the global healthcare system and possibly a step forward for people to get cheaper and safer medicines rather than afford for cancer therapy. However, time and minimum investment have to be spent to conduct further studies to improve the safety and success of the repurposed drugs.",
