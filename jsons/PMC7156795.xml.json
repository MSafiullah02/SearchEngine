On December 31, 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country office was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. An initial evaluation of these cases was undertaken. Four lower respiratory tract samples, including broncho-alveolarlavage (BAL) fluid, were collected from patients in Wuhan and compared with seven samples collected from patients in Beijing who had pneumonias of known cause [2]. More than 20,000 viral reads from individual specimens were obtained and most matched the genome from lineage B of the genus beta-Coronavirus showing greater than 85% identity with a bat SARS-like CoV.",

On January 11th and 12th of 2020, the Chinese National Health Commission identified the source of exposures at a seafood market in Wuhan City (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) (Fig. 1). A cohort of forty-one cases caused by SARS-Cov-2 was reported by Huang et al. [1]. A majority (30[73%]) were men with a median age of 49.0 years (IQR 41.0\u201358.0). Common initial symptoms included fever (40[98%]), cough (31[76%]) and myalgias or fatigue (18[44%]). All 41 patients had bilateral, multi-lobar pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Most patients were both leukopenic (low white blood cell count) and lymphopenic (< 1.0 \u00d7 109/L) on hospital admission. D-dimer levels were elevated, particularly among patients that required intensive care unit (ICU)-level care (median D-dimer level 2.4 mg/L vs 0.5 mg/L). A majority of patients had normal procalcitonin levels (< 0.1 ng/ml).",

The available information obtained by cryo-electron microscopy shows that only one receptor-binding domain binds ACE2 and adopts an upward conformation [13] (Fig. 2). Moreover, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor binding domain of S1 and promotes the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers. Soluble complexes can bind to host cell unoccupied ACE2 receptors. The available data suggest that the combinant receptor binding domain (RBD) portion of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has evolved to effectively target ACE2. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is so effective at binding human cells that the scientific community has concluded it is the result of natural selection [14\u201316]. The same is true of its backbone and overall molecular structure [17].",

Although the L type (~ 70%) is more prevalent than the S type (~ 30%), the S type is believed to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly [16, 18].",

A pragmatic trial design will be employed. When a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 is deemed eligible, the physician can enter the patient\u2019s data into a WHO website, including co-morbid conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or HIV infection. The participant has to sign an informed consent form that is scanned and sent to WHO electronically. After the physician states which drugs are available at his or her hospital, the website will randomize the patient to one of the drugs available or to the local standard care for COVID-19. A global data safety monitoring board will perform an interim analyses at regular intervals and determine whether any of the drugs has a clear beneficial effect, or whether one or more drugs can be dropped because they do not offer benefit. The first patients have recently been enrolled. Other drugs could be tested employing the SOLIDARITY trial network (www.who.int).",

The randomised, open-label, multi-center studies will assess the safety and efficacy of the drug in nearly 1000 patients. A five-day and ten-day dosing regimen of an intravenous formulation of remdesivir will be tested. The trials will mainly be conducted at sites in Asian countries, however, sites from other countries will likely be added. One of the trials will enroll approximately 400 patients with severe COVID-19, while the second trial will include approximately 600 patients with moderate severity COVID-19. Clinical improvement will be the primary outcome measure. In the first trial, normalization of temperature and oxygen saturation will be the focus. The second trial will record these measures based on the proportion of patients discharged by day 14. With the addition of the two phase III clinical trials, there are currently five trials of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. Results from at least one of the trials initiated in China is expected in the coming weeks.",
