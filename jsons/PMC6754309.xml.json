Some targets, such as IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), are protected from ubiquitin\u2010mediated proteasomal degradation.22 It has also been shown that viral proteins, including HIV\u20101 Gag, can be ISGylated.23 Durfee and colleagues21 propose that during an infection a small subset of viral structural proteins are ISGylated to disrupt the repeating structures found in viral capsids. Influenza B has evolved a mechanism to directly neutralize ISG15 with its NS1 protein24 and coronaviruses have a papain\u2010like protease that has deISGylase activity as a strategy to overcome ISG15,25, 26 indicating the importance of ISG15 in the antiviral response.",

Macrophages play an important role in this process and can act as mediators of inflammation.33, 34 We recently reported that HIV\u20101 replication in macrophages requires activity of STAT1, a protein usually associated with antiviral responses.35 The role of STAT1 was in postintegration expression of HIV\u20101 mRNA from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. This paradoxical mechanism where HIV\u20101 usurps antiviral pathways as a means of driving its own replication suggests that a complex host\u2013pathogen interplay ultimately determines if HIV\u20101 can efficiently replicate in macrophages. In general, the role of macrophages in the HIV\u20101 life cycle is important because eliminating persistently infected macrophages in addition to latently infected T cells will be necessary for a sterilizing cure to be achieved. Thus, it is critical that we understand the host\u2013pathogen dynamics that regulate HIV\u20101 replication in macrophages and understand how HIV\u20101 subverts the innate immune response including the potent antiviral T1 IFN response.",

The goal of this study was to determine the role of USP18 in HIV\u20101 infection/replication and determine if the IFNAR\u2010blocking effect of USP18 benefits HIV\u20101. We hypothesized that USP18 suppresses antiviral pathways that would normally restrict HIV\u20101 and that perturbing USP18 would restore and enhance these pathways leading to better control of the virus. To test this, we have utilized a novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR\u2010associated protein 9 (Cas9) knockout induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)\u2010derived macrophage model. Our data show that experimental depletion of USP18 in human macrophage models does restrict HIV\u20101 replication due to an enhanced cellular antiviral response and increased sensitivity to the effects of T1 IFN. Thus, USP18 benefits HIV\u20101 replication by striking a balance between weak IFN signals required for viral replication and strong IFN signals that would halt viral replication.",
