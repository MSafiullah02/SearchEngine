The health hazards and microbiological problems associated with various types of commercial buildings are often unique to the type of facility. The problem of air quality is paramount in commercial office buildings while the problem of biocontamination is of the highest concern in the food industry. Other types of buildings have their own microbial concerns and even their own standards. The pharmaceutical industry has the highest aerobiological air quality standards (and lowest airborne microbial levels) while the other extreme, the agricultural industry, has the highest airborne microbial levels and unique aerobiological concerns. The individual problems of these facilities are addressed in the following sections, and industry experience relating to UV applications are discussed, along with recommendations for how UV systems can be applied. The specific types of UVGI systems are described in previous chapters and these should be referred to for detailed information on such applications.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Commercial buildings are the single largest and most common type of building in the United States today, in terms of total floor area. Many common respiratory infections are regularly transmitted inside these structures due to daily occupancy and the extensive interaction of people within office buildings. Proximity and duration of exposure are major factors in the transmission of respiratory infections between office workers (Lidwell and Williams 1961) . The risk of catching the common cold is increased by shared office space (Jaakkola and Heinonen 1995) . Tuberculosis has also been show to transmit in office buildings between co-workers (Kenyon et al. 2000 ). An association between respiratory tract symptoms in office workers and exposure to fungal and house dust mite aeroallergens was established by Menzies et al. (1998) . The recent appearance of SARS virus highlights the susceptibility of office workers to the spread of airborne viruses (Yu et al. 2004) . Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), often referred to as Building Related Illness (BRI) is a general category for a number of ailments, allergies, and complaints that are due to low levels of pollutants, synthetic irritants, fungi, bacteria or other factors that cause reactions in a certain fraction of building occupants (Lundin 1991) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 457, "text": "(Lidwell and Williams 1961)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 533, "end": 561, "text": "(Jaakkola and Heinonen 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 647, "end": 666, "text": "(Kenyon et al. 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 814, "end": 835, "text": "Menzies et al.

The aerobiology of office buildings can depend on both indoor sources (i.e. occupancy and cleanliness) as well as the composition and concentration of microbes in the outdoor air. Environmental microbes can enter via the ventilation system, via occupants (i.e. on clothes and shoes), and infiltration, especially from high-traffic lobbies that are under high negative pressure. Office buildings provide an environment that sustains microorganisms long enough for them to transmit infections to new hosts, or sometimes allows them to persist indefinitely, as in the case of fungal spores (Kowalski 2006) . The indoor airborne concentrations of bacteria and fungi increase with the presence of occupants, due to the fact that people release bacteria continuously and also because human activity stirs up dust that may contain fungi and bacteria.

A suitable alternative to replacing filters is to add UV systems in the ductwork, which will not necessarily have any impact on airflow or pressure drop (see Fig. 18 .1).

There are many types of occupational diseases, including asthma, and allergic reactions or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which are not necessarily due to microbiological causes.

Occupational asthma occurs in 2-6% of the asthmatic population and respiratory infection can be a predisposing factor for occupational asthma (Bardana 2003) . Workers who clean or enter rarely-used rodent infested structures may be at increased risk of exposure to rodentborne viruses such as hantavirus (Armstrong et al. 1995) .

Foodborne pathogens are generally transmitted by the oral route and almost exclusively cause stomach or intestinal diseases but some foodborne pathogens may be airborne at various stages of processing, storage, cooking, or consumption. The processing and handling of foods may also create opportunities for airborne mold spores to germinate and grow, resulting in secondary inhalation hazards. Applications for UVGI in the food industry include both air and surface disinfection, including surface disinfection of packaging materials and food handling equipment. UV has been used for air and surface disinfection in cheese plants, bakeries, breweries, meat plants, for food preservation, and for the decontamination of conveyor surfaces, and packaging containers (Koutchma 2008).

In general, these do not present inhalation hazards, only ingestion hazards. However, some of these microbes can become airborne during processing and settle on foods, thereby becoming amenable to control by UV air and surface disinfection systems. Modern foodborne pathogens are often uniquely virulent and hazardous, like Salmonella and Shigella, which are contagious and depend on either on excretion in feces or vomiting to facilitate epidemic spread. Some agents of food poisoning, like Staphylococcus and Clostridium, are opportunistic or incidental contaminants of foods. Many molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium are common contaminants of the outdoor and indoor air that can grow on food and although they are not food pathogens they are potential inhalation hazards for food industry workers. Foodborne pathogens are predominantly bacteria but one virus has recently emerged and joined this class, Norwalk virus. Norwalk virus is a waterborne pathogen and has caused outbreaks on cruise ships (Marks et al. 2000) . Food spoilage microbes are less of a health hazard than they are a nuisance in the food industry because of the damage they can cause to processed food (Samson et al. 2000) . A wide variety of yeasts may also be causes of spoilage. Table 18 .1 lists the most common foodborne and waterborne pathogens in the food industry along with the type of hazard they present -pathogenic, toxic, allergenic, or spoilage. Many of the species listed in Table 18 .1 have UV rate constants as given in Appendices A, B, and C. Virtually all of the fungal spores listed in Appendix C are potential contaminants in the food industry. Toxins produced by microbes may be endotoxins, exotoxins, or mycotoxins, and these will grow only if the conditions (moisture, temperature, etc.) are right. The key to controlling these toxins is to control microbial growth and to control the concentration of microbes in the surrounding areas. Ambient microbial levels can be controlled by food plant sanitation, adequate ventilation, and by various UV air disinfection technologies. Most common food spoilage microbes have the capacity to transport in the air and therefore they are controllable to some degree by ventilation and by UV air disinfection systems. Evidence exists to suggest Listeria monocytogenes, a cause of many recent outbreaks, can settle on foodstuffs via the airborne route ( 1998) . Studies indicate that Salmonella can survive in air for hours (Stersky et al. 1972 ). If air is recirculated through plant ventilation systems, organic material may accumulate inside ductwork and on air handling equipment, where fungi and bacteria may grow ( 1998). Air filtration can go along way towards controlling the amount of organic debris that accumulates, but UV is an ideal technology for use in controlling microbial and fungal growth inside air handling units, ductwork, and on cooling coils.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1136, "end": 1155, "text": "(Marks et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1330, "text": "(Samson et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2528, "text": "( 1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2613, "text": "(Stersky et al. 1972", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1390, "end": 1398, "text": "Table 18", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1606, "text": "Table 18", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Food Industries"}, {"text": "Concerns about the breakage of bare UV lamps and mercury hazards has led to new lamps that are sealed in an unbreakable plastic coating, such as shown in Fig. 18 .2.

Animal facilities may also include non-agricultural buildings used to house or service animals such as pet shelters and zoos.

The microorganisms of greatest concern are those that can become airborne in animal facilities and these are often respiratory pathogens and allergens.
