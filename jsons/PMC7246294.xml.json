Critically ill patients are generally at risk for instability during transfer [4]. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, patient inter- or intra-hospital transfer is indicated in many situations involving multiple sites (wards, emergency department, intensive care unit, radiology suites and from non-COVID hospitals to COVID hospitals in some countries). Critically ill COVID-19 also pose the challenge of controlling viral transmission. Careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to minimize nosocomial spread to other patients and HCWs during their management [5]. Conducting COVID-19 patient transport safely is therefore important. Haphazard transportation can compromise the safety of patients, staff members and bystanders [6]. Efforts to avoid potential breaches in infection control should therefore be based on pre-defined protocols and guidelines for patient transport.",

Transfer of patients with confirmed disease from non-COVID centers to COVID centers represents a major challenge. Management of the environment after transporting an infected patient (e.g. equipment, ambulance) represents another such challenge. The department of Anesthesia and critical care-Al Adan hospital in Kuwait, developed a transportation protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients (Table 1) to ensure safe patient transport. During the current worldwide crisis, we hope that our protocol will assist others in managing safe transportation of COVID-19 patients.",
