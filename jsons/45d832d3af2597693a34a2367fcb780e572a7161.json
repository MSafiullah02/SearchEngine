As noted above, more people are living longer in most societies. However, 'age does not come by itself'; therefore, there are morbidity threats such as dementia or obesity that society must tackle. But this situation is arising as the state increasingly seeks to withdraw, or is being forced to withdraw, from the expense of welfare support for older people; therefore, governance and institutions must be examined in order to determine whether these remain, or can become 'fit for purpose' in different countries. In our chosen sample, for most of the people facing an emergency, they are most likely to require state support via the emergency services or the public health service (Wankhade 2011 (Wankhade , 2012 . It might be helpful to think about the national variations in performance of the emergency services and health providers on account of the variations in the co-production or social networks within countries/regions (see Andrews and Wankhade, forthcoming for a study of social capital and the UK ambulance service performance; Andrews and Brewer (2010) for social capital and fire service performance in the USA). A recent study (Timmons and Vernon-Evans 2013) has reported that community first responding has been quite successful in the health and pre-hospital care sector with clear implications for other voluntary organisations. But in a time of fiscal constraint, how is this provision being met, and what are the limitations of service provision? Finally, our sense of optimism is born from the growing evidence that 'community', however defined, can help to plug this gap in provision (Putnam 1993 (Putnam , 1995a (Putnam , b, 2000 Tavits 2006) . Who are the activists, what are their traditions, and how can they be nurtured given that current fiscal constraints affect community groups too, not just state providers.",

Improving public health and wellbeing is a high profile feature of government policies. The realms of public health have become broader in recognising the factors in people's social, economic, and physical environment that have a profound impact on their health and can create inequalities (Orme et al. 2007, p. 8) . It now involves a more diverse public health workforce and partnerships between organisations in the public, private, voluntary, and the third sector. Reducing disparities in health as a consequence of social and economic differences is a key government priority across the world (Griffiths and Hunter 2007) .

            "text": "In this exploration, we have decided to use the case study approach to different countries, as used by Cook and Halsall (2011) , and have selected the following eight countries to analyse: Firstly, the UK is selected because it is our home base and has the National Health Service (NHS) as its major health provider. The concept of aging and the 'Big Society' and the impact on the NHS are discussed in a previous publication in Halsall (2011) plus Halsall et al. (2013a, b) . The US context requires a deeper exploration being the biggest economy in the world plus a society that is highly polarised in terms of an often vicious debate concerning the state role in public sector health (Cook and Halsall 2011) . China offers quite a contrast to both these countries, representing not only a one-party dominated government and strong state, but one which since the reform period began in 1978 has moved towards market solutions to its social and economic problems. Again, this country is studied in Cook and Halsall (2011) . India is selected because of its pre-eminent position in the South Asian peninsula having a population of more than a billion people along with the familiarity of two authors (Cook and Wankhade) . Community governance in the UK and India has also been recently explored by the three authors (Halsall et al. 2013) . South Africa is chosen because of the experience gained in researching this fascinating country for Cook and Halsall (2011) and also because of the role of older people as carers in the light of the HIV/AIDS crisis that the country has faced. Bangladesh is a new choice, chosen in part because of Halsall's experience of this country plus complementary knowledge of the other two authors. Japan is selected because it was also in Cook and Halsall's previous book and because the country is the leading 'flying goose' in East Asia. The Netherlands provide a good European case study since the chosen themes are fairly well developed in Dutch society; while in addition is the availability of the academic resources in the English language. The following sections will focus on sociability, social capital, and community development.",

            "text": "As Cook and Norcup (2011) illustrate, the concept of sociability comes from the Russian social anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his book Mutual Aid, published in 1902. Peter Kropotkin was a fascinating figure, being born into the Russian aristocracy as a prince giving up the privileges of his noble birth due to his growing awareness of the poverty that was endemic to Russian society in the nineteenth century (Cook 1990 ). He joined a Cossack regiment rather than an elite one and spent time with them stationed in Siberia. Whilst there, he observed the poor levels of governance of the exile communities as well as anarchist ideas from the exiled poet Mikhailov. Despite grinding poverty and deprivation, he was impressed by the spirit of the exiles and the way in which they came together to survive and in some cases, prosper. He also observed this community spirit in animal species in this vast region. Many years later, by which time he was himself in exile from the Russian authorities and had become the 'leading' anarchist of his day, he drew together his observations of different societies, partly to counter the growing tendency towards Social Darwinism that was leading many thinkers at the time towards the doctrine of survival of the fittest and the eventual horrors of fascism. Cook (1994) has previously summarised Kropotkin's views of altruism and sociability in one of a series of public lectures at the University of Durham in celebration of Kropotkin's sesquicentenary in 1992, and what follows draws heavily on this source. As Cook (1994, p. 22 ) explains:",

This was in flat contradistinction to the prevailing orthodoxy of the Victorian era with its stress on competition and the bastardisation of Darwinian ideas towards 'Survival of the Fittest' at any cost. While Kropotkin admitted that there was 'an immense amount of warfare and extermination going on amidst various species\u2026there is at the same time, as much, or perhaps even more, of mutual support, mutual aid, and mutual defence amidst animals belonging to the same species, or, at least, to the same society. Sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle' (Kropotkin 1902 , p. 5, cited in Cook 1994 . In his field observations with the zoologist Poliakov, despite the fact that they were influenced by Darwin's Origin of Species to actively seek out instances of intraspecies competition, rather than co-operation, they searched in vain. Instead, they found that a whole range of species such as ants, bees, birds, antelopes, and even carnivores all depend on each other for support and survival. Indeed:",

Noting that Kropotkin did not seek to duck the issue of the individualistic competitiveness, which is also a feature of human affairs, and that the contemporary dominance of Thatcherism and Reaganism meant that, similar to the Victorians, there was a strong individualist competitive ethos, underpinned by the laissez-faire writings of Friedman, Hayek and others; nevertheless, it was essential to consider Kropotkin's alternative view that we are mutually supportive and cooperative as a species. This serves to remind us that there is another way of looking at human affairs and that we can search for and seek to develop further, the mutual aid dimension of human society. (Cook 1994, p. 24) Such a view was recently reflected, for example, in the fact that the United Nations declared 2012 as the International Year of Co-operatives, a milestone that marks an important recognition within the international community of the role of co-operatives in promoting the 'fullest possible participation in the economic and social development of all people', including women and peoples of all ages, creeds, ethnicities and disabilities. (Webster et al. (2011, p. 1) The volume from which this quote is taken, The Hidden Alternative: Co-operative Values, Past, Present and Future, provides examples of co-operative practice across the globe, over time and space, and several will be referred to below within this book where they have a public health dimension. Within that volume, MacPherson explores the relationships between individualism on the one hand and what he calls 'Communitarianism' on the other and presents a diagram reproduced here as Fig. 1.1 .",

Rowland (2009 p. 63 ) takes Battilani's definition further by drawing upon the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of social capital as 'networks, together with shared norms, values and understandings which facilitate cooperation within or among groups'. Such networks and relationships become an important community resource as social capital, for example in the process of population migration which can have an important impact on patterns of aging around the globe, either because of the loss of young people to other countries, or the more recent phenomenon of migration of older people themselves, either to their original home country or to warmer climes (see Cook and Halsall 2011 for a fuller discussion).",

Putnam (1995b, p. 67 ) defines social capital as 'features of social life-networks, norms, and trust-that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives' referring to the then social connections and the attendant norms and trust. Putnam (2000, p. 290) later argued in his American study that 'social capital makes us smarter, healthier, safer, richer and better able to govern a just and stable democracy' underlining the social and economic resources embodied in social networks.",

In the social policy field, social capital is seen as having the potential to reduce expenditure on social problems, encourage cooperation and trust and enhance quality of life. It assists in explaining why communities with similar resources may diverge in terms of social cohesion, initiative, mutual support, and adaptability to change. Although causal links are difficult to confirm, social capital in the form of social and civic engagement and cooperation appears to bestow advantages of wellbeing and resilience on communities, as well as on individuals.

This has been witnessed in several of the chosen case studies except in India, for example, where public spending has not been cut drastically. However, within our sample cases, circumstances involving either welfare budget cuts or improving citizen participation have necessitated a bigger role by the social networks in the co-production of the services. The concept of social capital, sometimes considered an ambiguous concept, has been drawing attention of political scientists; policy makers and commentators help explain the role and importance of social networks and community groups in improving the public service provision. Robert Putnam (2000) in his classic work, 'Bowling Alone' identified how the American society has increasingly become disconnected from one another and the various social structures such as church, political parties have disintegrated signifying a significant social change and a decline of generalised reciprocity (Putnam 2000, p. 505) . Field (2003 p. 1) argues that social capital can be summed up in two words: 'relationships matter. ' Skidmore et al. (2006, p. 8) have noted that there are strong connections 'between the properties of social capital and effectiveness of governance.' Hence the promotion and practice of social capital means better governance (Putnam 1993) .",

Bauman (2001, p. 1) has noted that 'company or society can be bad; but not the community. Community, we feel, is always a good thing.' It has become apparent when things go wrong in society; governments want to know why this happened. Furthermore, it has become common practise for governments to examine what went wrong and how problems can be solved. In this sense, a government tends to examine a community when that community is doing well (Campbell and Jovchelovitch 2000) .

            "text": "One area in which sociability, social capital, and community development is so important is with regard to the health and wellbeing of older people, who are increasing rapidly in number across the globe (e.g., Cook and Halsall 2011; Rowland 2009 ). Here, we utilise parts of two of Rowland's tables to highlight the numbers involved, both now and as this century unfolds. Table 1 .1 shows the top five countries in terms of percentage of people aged over 65 (10 % and 1 million cut-offs) from 1950 to 2050 (based on United Nations data). Not only do the top five countries change over time as other nations increase in longevity, but the percentages increase dramatically over time. And so, for example, France leads the way with 11.4 % in 1950 but slips out of the top five by 1975 and is replaced by Italy, with 18.1 %. By 2050, it is anticipated that Spain will lead the way with a massive 37.6 % of its population aged 65 or over. One caveat must be, however, that the current high rates of unemployment and indebtedness that Spain is suffering may have a negative impact on these projections, as may also be the case for Greece and, possibly, for Italy. Table 1 .2 provides the top five countries in terms of numbers rather than percentages; so unsurprisingly, China leads the way throughout, but the numbers increase from 25 million aged 65 or over in 1950 through to 332 million in 2050. In similar vein, India increases its numbers from 12 million in 1950 to 233 million projected by 2050. In all, as Cook and Halsall (2011, p. 5) note:",

Globally, it was estimated that in 2010, 35.6 million people suffer from this disease, rising to 65.7 million by 2030 (Rogers 2013, p. 260) . The cost of this to society was estimated at US$ 604 billion in 2010, with the 'baby-boomers' of the late 1940s/ early 1950s being at particular risk. Threats such as this worry decision-makers across the planet, particularly given that, currently, the cause of this disease is unknown (Rogers 2013) . However, there does seem to be remedial action that can be taken in terms of such factors as exercise, lifestyle, or 'resistance training' (Rogers 2013, p. 261 ) that can ameliorate or reduce some of the worst consequences of this dreadful disease. One aspect of our study of community action in different countries will be to discover to what extent community involvement can reduce the risk factors and improve the quality of life for dementia sufferers.",

            "text": "It is useful to briefly summarise some demographic and economic features of our sample countries to facilitate comparisons. Table 1 .3 accordingly presents key recent data for the sample. In terms of gross national income per head, therefore, the USA is the wealthiest country in the sample with a gross national income per capita (GNIpc) of US$ 50,120 in 2012, closely followed by the Netherlands at US$ 48,250 and Japan with US$ 47,870 and then the UK at US$ 38,250. There is then a marked jump to South Africa, and then the other three countries, with Bangladesh by far the poorest at US$ 840 GNIpc in 2012. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between GNIpc and the number of population per physician, and to a lesser extent with the population per hospital bed, but South Africa is a strange anomaly with a very low number of people per physician and per hospital bed, far lower than what would be expected in terms of national income. Perhaps this reflects the impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis that has had such a devastating impact on the country. In terms of population, China and India are of course by far the most populous countries, but China does better in terms of a number of criteria, including population per physician and per hospital bed plus life expectancy (72.4 for men in China in 2009 compared to 63.9 for Indian men in 2011 and 76.6 for women in China in 2009 contrasting with 67.1 for Indian women in 2011). This confirms the analysis of Dummer and Cook (2008) who found that China's health record was better than India's on a number of counts. India still has a high rate of infectious and parasitic diseases, for example, whereas China is now more likely to suffer from diseases associated with developed countries, such as cancers or heart diseases for instance. Japan is the longest-lived country in terms of life expectancy, at 79.9 for men and 86.4 for women, both for 2012, but it is South Africa rather than India or Bangladesh that comes out lowest on this data with 54.9 years for men and 59.1 years for women, both in 2011. Further, as Cook and Halsall (2011) have shown, there is a marked discrepancy between rates by ethnicity with Whites outliving Blacks in South Africa by a significant margin. These are the sorts of contrasts that will be discussed further in the country chapters below.",
