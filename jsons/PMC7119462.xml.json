The cause of MS is unknown, but it has been postulated that myelin damage is immune-mediated, possibly as an autoimmune process (Lovett-Racke et al., 1998). Epidemiological studies suggested that MS might be associated with viral triggers similar to other examples of autoimmune diseases (Allen and Brankin, 1993). Animal models of virus-induced demyelination provide useful tools for studying potential mechanisms that link demyelination with viral infections (Lavi et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a single-stranded enveloped RNA murine coronavirus member of the Nidovirales order, is one of the most extensively studied laboratory models for viral-induced chronic demyelinating disease in rodents Lavi et al., 1984b, Perlman et al., 1990, Stohlman and Weiner, 1981, Wege et al., 1982, Weiner, 1973. The immune system plays a major role in MHV pathogenesis. Macrophages and T lymphocytes play an important role in the recovery from MHV-induced viral infection (Wijburg et al., 1996). Antiviral antibodies or CD8+ T lymphocytes may protect infected animals from lethal encephalitis, but both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are required for effective viral clearance. CD4+ and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a pivotal role in protection against MHV-A59 infection (Heemskerk et al., 1995). Both CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and the CD4+ helper T cells can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system (Yamaguchi et al., 1991). While the pathogenesis of MHV-induced demyelination is still poorly understood, it may be due to a proinflammatory T cell-mediated pathology, as in MS (Martin and McFarland, 1996). However, it is not certain whether the immune system causes demyelination by direct cytotoxic response against infected oligodendrocytes, or if demyelination is the result of an indirect \u201cbystander\u201d autoimmune phenomenon through molecular mimicry or antigenic spreading. It has been shown that T cells are required and can modify the course of demyelination in JHM\u2013MHV-induced demyelination; however, the role of T cells in MHV-induced demyelination is still not clear. Although neither T cells nor B cells are absolutely required for MHV-induced demyelination (Matthews et al., 2002), the role of CD4 and CD8 cells is redundant but not identical in MHV-induced demyelination (Wu et al., 2000). It has been proposed that CD8 cells serve as initiators of a \u201cbystander\u201d effect that triggers demyelination (Haring et al., 2002).",

            "text": "T cell activation requires two signals. The first signal is triggered by the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen. This interaction produces both the antigen-specific components of the immune response as well as genetic (MHC) restriction. The second signal, termed costimulation, is triggered by the interaction of an accessory receptor on the T cell with its ligand on the antigen-presenting cell. The presence or absence of costimulation determines the outcome of TCR engagement Boise et al., 1995, Gimmi et al., 1993, Harding et al., 1992, Schwartz, 1990. Several receptor\u2013ligand interactions are capable of producing costimulation. However, the primary signal appears to be through the interaction of T cell CD28 with its ligand, either B7.1 (CD80) or B7.2 (CD86) Arima et al., 1996, Edmead et al., 1997, Karandikar et al., 1996. Studies with CD28 knockout (CD28\u2212/\u2212) mice have demonstrated the importance of CD28 in T cell-mediated immune responses (Bachmaier et al., 1996). The inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disorder experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats, a CD4+ T cell-mediated disease that serves as a prototypic model for MS, critically requires the costimulatory B7/CD28 pathway early in the disease. Some immune responses have an absolute requirement for CD28. For example, CD28\u2212/\u2212 mice do not produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) when challenged with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and do not develop fatal toxic shock syndrome (Saha et al., 1996). However, other immune responses remain either partially or completely intact, suggesting that other costimulatory pathways, through other receptors, may play a significant role (Lucas et al., 1995). To investigate whether CD28-costimulatory signal is required for induction of MHV-induced demyelination in vivo, we studied infection in CD28 knockout mice with a demyelinating strain, MHV-A59.",

Previous studies demonstrated a requirement for B7-mediated costimulation for the initiation of the encephalitogenic immune response. For example, blockade of B7.1 and B7.2 with the soluble receptor CTLA4 Ig ameliorates EAE following immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP), and suppresses the ability of MBP-reactive T cells to transfer EAE to naive synergic recipients Arima et al., 1996, Hurwitz et al., 1997. Therefore, we had anticipated that the absence of CD28 signaling would result in a diminished or absent immune response and less demyelination following MHV-A59 infection of CD28\u2212/\u2212 mice. This hypothesis, however, can only be indirectly investigated since mice susceptible to MHV-A59 (B6) are resistant to EAE, and mice susceptible to EAE (SJL) are resistant to MHV-A59. The induction of MHV-A59-induced demyelination is therefore performed in a different mouse strain than EAE. Nevertheless, our studies showed that unlike EAE, CD28 costimulation is not required for MHV-A59-induced demyelination, and both sets of animals develop demyelination in 100% of the mice. We therefore suggest that MHV-induced demyelination may use different cellular and molecular immune-mediated mechanisms than the ones used in EAE.",
