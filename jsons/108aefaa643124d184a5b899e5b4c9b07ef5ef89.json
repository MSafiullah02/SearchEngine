Disease control has rehed upon quarantine and movement controls, and eradication has been achieved by slaughtering of all birds on infected farms. There are currently no commercially applicable vaccines available for the control of AL Recombinant FPV expressing the HA subtype H5 and the nucleoprotein (NP) of Al have been evaluated in poultry for vaccine efficacy.^^\"^^ The HA H5 subtype expressed by FPV provided very good protection against Al disease in chickens and turkeys. In some but not all challenge situations Al virus replication and shedding was also substantially reduced. Protection -was subtype specific -with FPV-H5 recombinants protecting against H5 subtype viruses but not against H7 subtype virus. Immunization with a rFPV expressing the cross-reactive NP antigen did not provide protective immunity against Al. The results sliow that vaccination protection against Al is mediated by antibodies directed against the HA. Protection is provided against disease, but substantial virus replication and shedding can occur in the vaccinated and challenged bird. The failure of the NP to induce protection in poultry, in spite of its cross-reactivity across subtypes, reinforces the observations made in the mouse influenza model, where vaccinia virus NP recombinants failed to provide protection against disease and infection even though they were able to induce cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes \"\u00b0 \"\" [28] [29] [30] Marek's disease vaccine All of the currently available vaccines against MDV, with the exception of those based on the related HVT, are delivered as cellassociated viruses requiring storage and transport on liquid nitrogen.

Vaccines applied at this age face two significant problems. The immunological immaturity of the day old birds reduces vaccine efficacy and maternally derived antibodies adsorbed via the yolk sac have the potential to interfere with active immunization at this early age. Some disease control strategies deliberately endeavour to maximize maternally derived antibodies by hyperimmunization of the laying hen to protect the newly hatched bird during the first 3-5 weeks of age. Vaccination is then carried out when maternally derived antibodies have waned sufficiently to no longer interfere with active immunization. In practice the proper timing of this vaccination is difficult since waning maternally derived protection can lead to a period in which many birds in a fiock are susceptible to infection prior to protection being conferred by active immunization.",

Cotton rats receiving hyperimmune serum to RSV glycoproteins prior to vaccination with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing RSV glycoproteins had suppressed antibody responses and were more susceptible to infection than control animals. Suppression was both qualitative and quantita-tive with the total antibody responses to the glycoproteins being suppressed and the suppression was selective for epitopes involved in induction of neutralizing antibodies.'^''\"^'* Passively acquired antibodies to the vector may also lead to suppression of immune responses to the vector and co-expressed antigen.-'^ This immunosuppression appears to operate on both the B and T cell responses and may extend beyond the time after which residual maternally derived antibodies are no longer detectable.^^ Since application of poultry vaccines to 1 day old chickens is crucial to the successful control of disease in many cases, the impact of maternally derived antibodies upon vaccine efficacy warrants further detailed investigation.",

Some, such as Al, may provide a vaccine where none has existed before and others, such as MDV, may be significantly cheaper to produce and deliver. Where routes of inoculation have been compared, the most efficacious has been by wing web inoculation.^^ This has the disadvantages of being labour intensive, costly and best applied at 1 day of age. Mass vaccination strategies (e.g. via drinking water or aerosol) do not appear to be applicable to rFPV unless suitable FPV parent strains can be found. Vaccination and challenge experiments have shown that rFPV can induce protection against overt clinical disease. Their efficacy has not been directly compared with conventional vaccines and the longevity of responses has not been determined. With many poultry diseases, protection against disease alone is not sufficient to prevent production losses as infection without overt clinical disease may still lead to very significant production losses. Recombinant FPV may find a useful role in poultry disease control when used in conjunction with conventional vaccines. In the case of FPV-NDV recombinants the combined use of conventional and rFPV vaccines generated better immune responses than either alone.'^T he issue of whether rFPV or other vector based vaccines can circumvent the problems of vaccination in the face of high maternally derived antibodies is yet to be resolved but it remains a central issue in the application of vector based vaccines for poultry disease control. Other vector viruses (e.g. adenoviruses and herpesviruses) may be more suitable for mass administration in the face of maternally derived antibodies.
