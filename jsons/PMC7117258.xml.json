The causative agent of this disease is feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, transmembrane (M) protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein (Olsen, 1993), and is classified into types I and II according to S protein properties (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Motokawa et al., 1995, Motokawa et al., 1996). Each of these types consists of two viruses: FIP-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FIPV and FECV of the same type cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats.",

            "text": "In the early stage of experimental FIPV infection, general symptoms such as fever, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea occur. The development of pathological states after systemic viral dissemination is considered to depend largely on the immune state of the host, particularly the presence or absence of the induction of cell-mediated immunity (TH1 activity): its strong induction inhibits the development of FIP (Pedersen et al., 1984). In cats with overt FIP, the counts of peripheral blood T cells, including CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells, are markedly decreased (De Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005). The induction of humoral immunity (TH2 activity) is considered to be ineffective or rather to aggravate the condition. In the ascitic fluid cells of FIP cats, the production of IL-6, a cytokine involved in the induction of B cell differentiation, is increased (Goitsuka et al., 1990). Antibody production induces immune complexes formation and deposition and a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Recently, Kiss et al. (2004) suggested that immunity against FIP progress is associated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma response imbalance, with high TNF-alpha/low IFN-gamma mRNA response favouring disease and low TNF-alpha/high IFN-gamma mRNA responses being indicative of immunity.",

On the contrary, lymphocyte depletion and the presence of apoptotic cells were reported to be detected in the T-cell region of mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen of FIP cats (Haagmans et al., 1996). Dean et al. (2003) reported that the FIPV antigen, TNF-alpha expression, and lymphocyte depletion were colocalized in the lymphoid tissues of FIP cats. Haagmans et al. (1996) reported that anti-human TNF-alpha did not inhibit apoptosis induced by ascitic fluid from FIPV-infected cats. Thus, the detailed mechanism of apoptosis induction in the lymphoid tissue of FIP cats remains unclear. As described above, FIP cats show a marked reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Since FIPV does not replicate in peripheral blood lymphocytes, it is difficult to consider this lymphopenia to be due to direct destruction by virus infection of lymphocytes, leaving the causes unknown. Since the development of FIP is closely related to the immune function of the host, clarification of the mechanism of lymphopenia is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of FIP.",

In this study, we showed that: (1) the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA expression was increased in the PEC and PBMC of FIP cats, (2) the PEC culture supernatant and plasma of FIP cats showed cytotoxic activity against TNF-alpha-sensitive WEHI-164 cells, and (3) the ability of the ascitic fluid and PEC culture supernatant of FIP cats to induce apoptosis in the PBMC of SPF cats was inhibited by caspase-3, caspase-8, and p38-MAPK inhibitors, suggesting that apoptosis in the lymphocytes of FIP cats is mainly induced by TNF-alpha. These results support the report of Dean et al. (2003) that lymphocyte depletion and TNF-alpha expression were colocalized in the lymphoid tissues of FIP cats. However, Haagmans et al.

These adherent cells had the morphology of macrophages, and the FIPV gene was detected in them by RT-PCR. The macrophage is one of the target cells of FIPV, and FIPV infection of macrophages is considered to be an important factor in the progression of FIP (Rottier et al., 2005, Stoddart and Scott, 1989). Thus, we speculate that FIPV-infected macrophages produce TNF-alpha, which induces apoptosis in lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells.

            "text": "TNF-alpha binds to TNFR to induce an apoptotic signal in cells (Herbein and O\u2019Brien, 2000). Two types of TNFR are known to exist: TNFR1 has a death domain, and is directly involved in the induction of apoptosis (Herbein and O\u2019Brien, 2000), whereas TNFR2 has no death domain, but assists in apoptosis-inducing signal transduction (Chan and Lenardo, 2000, Fotin-Mleczek et al., 2002). In this study, we showed that the levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA expression were increased in the PBMC of FIP cats and the PBMC of SPF cats that had been cultured in the presence of the PEC culture supernatant, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis in the lymphocytes of FIP cats is closely associated with TNF-alpha. In particular, in CD8+ cells, the levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA expression were increased, suggesting that CD8+ cells are more susceptible to apoptosis induction by TNF-alpha than other subsets of lymphocytes. The rate of apoptosis induction in CD21+ cells (B cells) by specimens from FIP cats was lower than those in CD8+ and CD4+ cells. Goitsuka et al. (1990) reported that IL-6 activity was increased in the ascitic fluid and PEC culture supernatant of FIP cats. IL-6 is known to be involved in the differentiation and proliferation of B cells and the inhibition of apoptosis (Dolcetti and Boiocchi, 1996, Liu et al., 1994, Moreno et al., 2001, Tumang et al., 2002). Therefore, the low rate of apoptosis induction in CD21+ cells suggests the influence of IL-6 contained in specimens from FIP cats. In CD21+ cells cultured in the presence of the PEC culture supernatant, the levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA expression remained unchanged, also suggesting that IL-6 is involved in the rate of apoptosis induction by TNF-alpha. At present, it is not clear why the levels of TNFR mRNA expression increase in CD8+ and CD4+ cells cultured in the presence of the PEC culture supernatant. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between T-cell apoptosis induction and TNFR in FIP cats.",
