Accordingly, high troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19.

The latter occurs in approximately 3-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, depending on the cohort. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Analyzing the first reports from China, a considerable proportion of patients (12-28%) presented elevated cardiac troponin levels. 1, 6, 8, 9 Compared with patients with normal levels, those with elevated troponins were older and had significantly higher rates of comorbidities including hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes. 6 Notably, patients with higher troponin levels were more likely to be admitted to intensive care 1, 5 and showed higher in-hospital mortality. [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] Acute respiratory infections as well as sepsis are often associated with a troponin rise, which can be used as a marker of disease severity and predicts future cardiovascular events. 14-16 Hypotheses on COVID-19-associated myocardial injury are consistent with previous observations relating to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Several mechanisms have been proposed, which are summarized in Figure 1 . In the following paragraphs we provide an overview of the available evidence regarding the possible mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19.",

            "text": "Myocarditis is defined as an inflammatory disease of the myocardium diagnosed by established histological, immunological and immunohistochemical criteria. 17 Many viruses are cardiotropic, meaning they bind directly on molecular targets in the myocardium. Myocardial damage may be due to different mechanisms. In the initial phase of viral myocarditis, direct virus-mediated lysis of cardiomyocytes occurs. 18 This is usually followed by a robust T-cell response that can lead to further heart injury and ventricular dysfunction. 19, 20 In COVID-19, particular attention has been given to the role of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. 21 ACE2 is highly expressed in pericytes of adult human hearts, which indicates an intrinsic susceptibility of heart to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 22 SARS-CoV-2 appears to not only gain initial entry through ACE2 but also to subsequently downregulate ACE2 expression, resulting in reduced conversion of Angiotensin II (Ang-II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-1-7). The latter physiologically mediates protective cardiovascular effects in target organs. 23, 24 In autopsies of patients who died from the SARS outbreak in 2002, 35% of heart samples showed the presence of viral RNA in the myocardium, which in turn was associated with reduced ACE2 protein expression. 25 SARS-CoV-2 may share the same mechanism with the first SARS-coronavirus because the two viruses are highly homologous in genome. 6, 26, 27 The consequences of ACE2 downregulation on the cardiovascular system is further expanded upon below.",

A clinical trial testing recombinant human ACE2 as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 is currently ongoing (NCT04335136). This drug may play a double role, both by acting as a decoy and competitively reducing viral cell entry, and by restoring ACE2 activity and its beneficial role. 36 Endothelial dysfunction, cytokine storm, oxidative stress, and Ang-II upregulation may explain the coagulopathy frequently seen in severe coronavirus disease. 37 A postmortem study from Singapore 38 on patients with SARS reported that 4 patients out of 8 had pulmonary thromboembolic lesions and 3 patients had deep vein thrombosis. To date, there is only one described case of COVID-19-associated pulmonary embolism, 39 but around half of patients with COVID-19 present high levels of D-dimer, 3 which is associated to disease severity and higher mortality. 40 This marked elevation in D-dimer may be due to intense inflammation stimulating intrinsic fibrinolysis in the lungs with spillover into the bloodstream. 41 Another factor that may contribute to microangiopathy is vasculitis. Several studies have linked coronavirus infection with Kawasaki disease, especially in children. [42] [43] [44] Furthermore, a case series of three deceased SARS patients in 2003 described findings of systemic vasculitis, including edema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles. 45 It has been suggested that, in patients with COVID-19, microvascular damage occurring in the heart causes perfusion defects, vessel hyperpermeability and vasospasm, leading to myocardial injury. 46, 47 Notably, a considerable proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 present with acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with worse prognosis. 8, 48 The mechanism may be the same, with microangiopathy of renal vessels, but there is no strong supporting evidence to date. Worsening of troponin clearance in patients with AKI could also contribute to the elevated levels in those patients.",

Moreover, hypoxemia also leads to excessive intracellular calcium with consequent cardiac myocyte apoptosis. 47 By definition, a type 2 MI can occur with or without underlying CAD.

Thus, downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, with a consequent reduction in Ang-1-7 levels, may magnify the cytokine storm resulting in an overwhelming inflammatory response. 6, 57 Cytokines have been extensively studied in patients with heart failure due to their role in inflammatory modulation, myocyte stress/stretch, myocyte injury and apoptosis, fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling. 58 In the study by Guo et al., plasma troponin levels had a significant positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis during the progress of disease. 6 In addition to their direct effects on cardiomyocytes, high levels of circulating cytokines also lead to functional reprogramming of endothelial cells, endothelial dysfunction, and atherogenesis. 6, 59, 60 In fact, endothelial cells are thought to play a primary role in the inflammatory response in viral infections. 61 Thus, systemic inflammatory response with cytokine storm is a plausible cause of myocardial injury in the late phases of disease, usually associated with ARDS, multi-organ failure and mortality. Overall, high cytokine levels may represent the key player of myocardial injury in COVID-19, being related to direct myocardial injury, endothelial dysfunction, destabilization of coronary plaque, and microthrombogenesis.",
