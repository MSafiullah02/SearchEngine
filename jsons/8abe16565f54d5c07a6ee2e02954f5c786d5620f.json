Hence, it is pertinent that NP interacts with a multitude of host proteins to modulate their functions for the benefit of the virus. To identify host proteins that interact with NP and other viral proteins of IAV, two technologies have been extensively used: the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system [4, 5] and biochemical purification/MS [6] . The recently developed RNA interference (RNAi) based screening technique is being widely used to deduce the host cellular pathways and host factors involved in the IAV replication [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In the present study, using the Y2H system, we identified human a-actinin-4 (referred to subsequently as actinin-4) as a novel interacting partner of IAV NP. Actinin-4 is a ubiquitously present, non-muscle isoform of a-actinin that cross-links F-actin together with other proteins and keeps the cytoskeleton intact [12] . Out of the four isoforms of human a-actinin, actinin-1 and actinin-4 are reported to be present in cell protrusions and cell adhesions of numerous cell types.

In agreement with this concept, several studies have shown that influenza NP interacts with a number of host cell proteins, including actin, CRM-1, BAT1/UAP56, importin a1 and NF-90 [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Y2H screening analysis is a traditional method of choice for exploring the interacting partners of critical proteins. Y2H has been validated, modified and improved, making its utility more far-reaching. Compared to the conventional method of Y2H, the newlyintroduced RNAi screens are only beginning to be employed for mapping cellular interactomes of important proteins. Using high-throughput RNAi screens, 1449 human genes have been identified as potential host factors involved in influenza virus replication [22] . However, most of these interactions between viral and host proteins have not been validated under conditions of infection, nor has their physiological relevance been unravelled. By contrast, Y2H screens with NP as a bait protein have revealed Hsp40 [4] , karyopherinalpha [23] and clusterin [24] as unique host-interacting partners, and the functional significance of each of these interactions has been well-documented. Using the Y2H system, we identified actinin-4 as an interacting partner of NP. For the first time, the present study provides evidence that actinin-4, a key cytoskeletal component, interacts with NP, facilitates its intercompartmental localization and promotes viral replication. We validated this interaction in a cell-free translation system, by transfection of mammalian cells, as well as in IAVinfected cells. We found that this interaction was well conserved across different subtypes of influenza viruses, ranging from seasonal viruses to the current pandemic H1N1 strain, signifying that the interaction between NP and actinin-4 is very important, irrespective of the IAV strain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 402, "end": 406, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 920, "end": 924, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1203, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is well established that viruses manipulate the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate viral entry, endocytosis, replication, egress and cell-to-cell spread, and thus depend on molecular interactions with host cytoskeletal proteins [25, 26] .

The clone identified by Y2H screening contained a 770-911 amino acid region of human a actinin-4 that corresponds to the spectrin repeat region-4 in the full-length protein, emphasizing the significance of these repeats not only for regulating the host cytoskeleton, but also for host-viral crosstalk. Recently, actinin-4 was also shown to function as a coactivator in the regulation of transcription networks to control cell growth [31] .

Upon IAV infection, actinin-4 was observed to accumulate increasingly around the nucleus (white arrows) compared to the uninfected cell (yellow arrows) (Fig. 6E,F) . Based on this observation, it can be hypothesized that the increase in the expression of actinin-4 may be attributed to the transport of NP across the nucleus. Because we observed co-localization of these two proteins in the cytoplasm, we examined changes in the localization of NP in the absence of actinin-4. Notably, NP was retained in the cytoplasm with reduced transport to the nucleus. In support of this observation, actinin-4 is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is imported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex in an import-independent manner [32]. Therefore, our data suggest that actinin-4 might be involved in facilitating shuttling of NP/viral ribonucleoproteins across subcellular compartments to promote virus replication. Because actinin-4 is known to interact with actin within the cytoskeletal framework, it is possible that the shuttling of NP between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments may involve the formation of a ternary complex of NP, actinin-4 and actin. The retention of NP inside the nucleus as a result of the migration of actinin-4 from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus on treating the cells with wortmannin furthered our hypothesis. These possibilities remain to be examined more carefully. Interestingly, the virus dose as well as the duration of infection elevates the expression of actinin-4, which is consistent with observations showing that viral infection alters the expression of host cell proteins involved in protein synthesis, transcriptional regulation and signaling [33] [34] [35] .

The reduction in replicase activity of the polymerase in actinin-4 depleted cells further strengthens our hypothesis that actinin-4 plays a direct or indirect role in the replication of influenza life cycle.
