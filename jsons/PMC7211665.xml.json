            "text": "Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 emerged initially in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and since then has rapidly spread worldwide. The epidemic has resulted in a total of 82,758 confirmed cases and 4,632 death cases in China as of February 24th, 2020 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202004/b504a02486834baf8ed8149701a4175b.shtml). Although about 80% of the confirmed patients are mild cases, mortality of critical cases reaches 49% in some areas [1]. How SARS-CoV-2-infected patients progress to critical disease is a key issue in clinical practice. Only a few case reports of pulmonary pathology about Covid-19 have been published to date [2, 3]. Given the lack of more histopathological evidence, pathophysiological alterations underlying Covid-19 progression remain largely unknown. Here, we report about a 65-year-old patient who died of Covid-19. We analyzed his lung tissue and determined the potential correlation between lung pathological alterations and disease progression.",

He was confirmed as Covid-19 positive in February 2nd by qPCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2RNA of samples collected by nasopharyngeal swabs. At the same day, chest CT scan revealed diffuse ground-glass shadows in the bilateral lungs (Fig.1A-B\n). He developed to type 1 respiratory failure (PO2 47.6 mmHg and PCO2 24.8 mmHg) on February 4th. Two days later, the patient received methylprednisolone 40 mg every 12h and antibiotic (biapenem) treatment due to high temperature (39.2\u00b0C), and enlarged pulmonary lesions were visible by chest CT. On February 11th, the patient progressed to type II respiratory failure (PO2 56 mmHg and PCO2 49.4 mmHg). X-Ray showed multiple plaque shadows in bilateral lungs, in particular, in the right side (Fig 1 C). To reduce edema of respiratory tracts, the dose of methylprednisolone was increased to 80 mg every 12h. Unfortunately, pneumonia was further exacerbated (Fig 1 D).",

High magnification microscopy highlighted extensive areas of acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophils and some lymphoid cells and alveolar macrophages (Fig2B).

The alveoli collapsed and fused along with the widened alveolar septum. Proliferating fibroblasts surrounded by neutrophils were observed in the alveolar septum (Fig3C). In distinct alveolar septa, pulmonary capillaries were dilated by microthrombi (arrow in Fig3D). Alongside with alveolar septa, hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells was seen (Fig4A\n).

The first two times showed virus positivity (January 28th and February 2nd). Since February 6th, four times SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing by nasopharyngeal swabs were negative (Table 1). Consistent with nasopharyngeal swabs tests, we did not detect positive SARS-CoV-2 N protein by immunohistochemical staining in lung tissue after biospy. These results suggest that infected SARS-CoV-2 might have been cleared at least on February 6th, two weeks after presenting in hospital. Scrutinizing dynamically altered clinical parameters shown in Table 1, the following time points were critical for clarifying the disease progress: (1) February 2nd: CT scan confirmed bilateral pneumonia; (2) February 5th: type 1 respiratory failure; (3) February 8th: kidney injury; (4) February 11th: type 2 respiratory failure and cardiac insufficiency; (5) February 13th: heart failure and septic shock; (6) February 14th: liver failure and death. In addition to the time points reflecting disease progression, it should also be paid attention to the time this patient received steroid and antibiotics therapy. As shown in Table 1, the patient received steroid therapy from February 5th to February 14th (death), whereas antibiotic treatment was starting on February 6th. Based on these analyses, the patient suffered from SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia at least on February 2nd. The virus was inhibited and cleared between February 2nd and February 6th. Unfortunately, he developed into type 1 respiratory failure on February 5th. The deteriorating respiratory disease was not connected to SARS-CoV virus infection anymore, because the virus was undetectable from this time point. Based on his lung histological alterations, such as multiple phlegm plugs in the alveolar spaces, a secondary bacterium infection might have occurred in this patient. Unfortunately, respiratory and blood cultures for bacteria and other organisms were not performed. It has been reported that severe Covid-19 patients were often superimposed on bacterial or fungal infection [6]. Hence, two patient managements might have worsened the disease: steroid therapy [7, 8] and a too late start of the antibiotics therapy [9, 10]. Although steroid therapy is useful to prevent a cytokine storm, it inhibits immune responses to pathogen infections (as might have occurred). As shown in Table 1, lymphocyte numbers in the patient were impressively less, in particular since initiation of steroid therapy. In addition, high dosage of methylprednisolone treatment led to deleterious pneumonia. Given the missed diagnosis of the potential bacterial infection, antibiotics treatment was started too later in this patient, which might have resulted in multi-organ failure due to a septic shock.",
