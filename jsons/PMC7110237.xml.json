The same data in the daily reports provide the basis for daily updates to the World Health Organization. The daily reports included details of the treating hospital, sex, age, and chronic disease history for each individual SARS case who died. Furthermore, the sex and age distribution of all SARS cases was obtained after personal communication with the Hong Kong Department of Health in September 2003. The current analysis is based on all SARS mortality data from early March to September 22, 2003. Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding all health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis. Age and sex distribution was available for the first 374 infected health care workers (5), and the number of infected health care workers in each age- and sex-specific stratum as of September 22, 2003, was estimated from this information.",

The respective age- and sex-adjusted case fatality rates for the three age groups were 2.8 percent, 21.4 percent, and 63.6 percent for females compared with 6.4 percent, 30.9 percent, and 64.7 percent for males. On the basis of a logistic regression model with mortality as the dependent measure and sex and age as the independent measures, both sex and age were found to be significant (p = 0.004 and p < 0.0001, respectively), while the interaction term between sex and age was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). The adjusted relative risk for males compared with females was 1.62 (95 percent CI: 1.21, 2.16). Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis (table 1). We found that the overall crude relative risk of mortality was 1.41 (95 percent CI: 1.15, 1.73), while the adjusted relative risk was 1.48 (95 percent CI: 1.10, 2.00).",

            "text": " So far, there have been no known reports, based on larger samples, of a gender difference in SARS case fatality rates. In this short study, we found that the overall case fatality rate was 17.0 percent among the cumulated 1,755 probable SARS cases in Hong Kong. Males had a significantly (p < 0.0001) higher case fatality rate than females did, 21.9 percent versus 13.2 percent; the relative risk was 1.66 (95 percent CI: 1.35, 2.05), and it was 1.62 (95 percent CI: 1.21, 2.16) after adjustment for age. A logistic regression model revealed that sex and age were both significantly related to the case fatality rate. However, the analysis also showed that the gender difference could not be explained by a significantly higher age distribution among the males compared with the females. Regarding the age of SARS cases, all females were significantly younger than males, which is explained by the relatively high number of infected hospital staff (22 percent) among all SARS patients, especially nurses (5); 60 percent of all infected health care workers (n = 384) were females less than age 45 years (5). However, this \u201cselected\u201d health care patient population is unlikely to have biased the gender difference observed in the mortality rate, since the vast majority, or 85.3 percent, of the deaths occurred among patients over 44 years of age, and subgroup analysis excluding all health care workers showed a significant sex difference in the mortality rate.",

            "text": " This observation may indicate that males are more severely affected than females by the SARS coronavirus (8). Our results show that the SARS mortality gender difference was highest for younger patients (0\u201344 years of age), with a relative risk of about 2 (also after excluding health care workers from the analysis). This gender difference was also observed for patients aged 45\u201374 years (relative risk = 1.45) but not for elderly patients, those aged 75 years or older. The diminishing gender-specific SARS mortality rate with increasing age may be due to the generally age-dependent trend of the health of a population, that is, that age becomes much more important than any possible gender difference. This possibility is suggested by the fact that the overall SARS mortality rates were 4.3 percent, 25.7 percent, and 64.2 percent for the three age groups, respectively. However, the exact mechanism regarding how the SARS coronavirus infects and manifests itself in humans has yet to be elucidated. Before making any wider interpretation, we would be interested to see whether our findings are confirmed from data collected in other regions with a high SARS prevalence. In this short study, we did not analyze other factors that might influence the case fatality rate, such as time since the onset of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, the hospital involved in treating the SARS patients, or treatment regimens.",
