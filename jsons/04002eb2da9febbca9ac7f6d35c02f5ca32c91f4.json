It is important to describe the clinical characteristics of low severity patients to provide information for early clinical recognition of COVID-19 and to prompt rapid self-quarantine for people with presumed symptoms who are not sick enough to warrant hospitalization. Moreover, mild patients can facilitate rapid dissemination of COVID-19 by unwittingly spreading the virus in the outpatient setting; this group appears to be a major driver of the pandemic (13) . Because COVID-19 testing has largely focused on patients with respiratory symptoms-not digestive symptoms-it is possible that there is a large cohort of undiagnosed patients with low severity illness but with digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, who unknowingly spread the virus. In this study, we sought to better understand the prevalence and clinical characteristics of this important COVID-19 subgroup with digestive symptoms and mild disease.",

We began by reviewing the clinical records of 850 consecutively hospitalized patients admitted between February 13, 2020, and February 29, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens (5) . From this group, we included patients who met the criteria for mild disease severity, defined as patients without dyspnea, without clinical evidence of respiratory distress and were able to maintain blood oxygen saturation above 93% in resting condition (14) . Of note, these patients were admitted to the hospital despite mild symptoms to monitor clinically and to maintain in quarantine during the peak of the Wuhan outbreak until they had 2 sequential negative respiratory tract specimens collected $24 hours apart according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control guidance (4). We excluded patients from this study who were unable to provide a history of presenting illness and/or did not have complete clinical data available for extraction. We also excluded patients who had not yet achieved viral clearance of COVID-19 and thus were not yet discharged at the time of this analysis. From this group, we systematically evaluated the symptoms recorded on the admission intake, supported by direct patient interviews using a standardized questionnaire and by telephone interview into the patient's room when necessary (because of extreme isolation precautions), to identify a cohort of patients with one or more digestive symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.",

The average hospital stay was 23.7 days while awaiting symptom resolution and objective evidence of viral clearance. Patients with digestive symptoms had a longer period between initial symptom onset and hospital admission than patients with only respiratory symptoms (Table 1 and Figure 2a ; 16.0 6 7.7 vs 11.6 6 5.1 days, P , 0.001).

We found that compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms, those with digestive symptoms tend to have a longer course between symptom onset and viral clearance and are more likely to test positive for COVID-19 viral RNA in the stool, suggesting (but not confirming) direct infectivity of the virus on the intestinal tract. In addition, patients with digestive symptoms took longer to report for medical care, a finding observed in other research from Wuhan, China (7), suggesting that COVID-19 was not initially recognized in these patients leading to delayed diagnosis. The longer disease course in patients with digestive symptoms might reflect a higher viral burden in these patients in comparison to those with only respiratory symptoms. Because the intestinal wall is invaded by COVID-19, there may be Figure 2 . Illness duration (in days), including days before admission, total time in hospital before evidence of viral clearance, and total duration between symptom onset and viral clearance. Panel A provides data across the full study cohort. Panel B compares data between those with vs without diarrhea, demonstrating a longer disease course in those with diarrhea. Panel C focuses on those with digestive symptoms only and compares those with vs without diarrhea on presentation (no differences noted).

These patients are more likely to test positive in stool RNA for COVID-19, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with respiratory symptoms. In some cases, the digestive symptom, particularly diarrhea, can be the initial presentation of COVID-19 and may only later (or never) present with respiratory symptoms. These data emphasize that patients with new-onset diarrhea after a possible COVID-19 contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or even fever. These patients should self-quarantine and seek medical care if not already under evaluation. Optimally, testing for COVID-19 should be performed using both respiratory and stool samples, if available.",
