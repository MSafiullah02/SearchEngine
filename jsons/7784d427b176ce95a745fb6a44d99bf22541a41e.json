A length of about 3-4 cm incision was located in the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the right axillary midline. The thoracoscope was always located at the back of the incision. Thoracoscopic surgery was performed according to modularity: (1) The mediastinal pleura above the azygos vein arch was incised to expose the right vagus nerve. We separated retrogradely along the right vagus nerve to reveal the origin of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve. Then the right recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph nodes were dissected (Fig. 1a) . After that, we separated the upper esophagus from the spinal side of the esophagus and protected the thoracic duct. (2) We used double joint forceps to separate the azygos vein arch and then used hemlock to clamp the proximal and distal ends of the azygos vein arch (Fig. 1b) . (3) The spinal side of the esophagus was separated from the azygos vein arch to the esophageal hiatus, and then the anterior part of the esophagus was free to the bifurcation of the tracheobronchial tract. (4) The esophagus was suspended with purse-string at the level of azygos vein arch (Fig. 2a) . The lymph nodes around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve were dissected by esophageal mesangial suspension. (Fig. 2b) . The upper esophagus was completely dissociated to the pleura. (5) The esophagus was drawn to the anterior part of the thorax with silk thread, and the silk thread was drawn out from the incision to remove the subcarinal lymph nodes (Fig. 3a) .

The incision was located at the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the midaxillary line, where there were few muscles and was not prone to bleeding. The incision at this site caused less muscle and nerve damage than the posterior axillary incision and had less impact on the patient's sensation and movement after surgery. When performing uniportal thoracoscopy, the thoracoscopic lens was directly aligned to the surgical field of view. As a result, the depth of vision made it easier for surgeons to determine the operating Fig. 1 a Dissection of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph nodes. b The arch of the azygos vein was severed Fig. 2 a The esophagus was drawn with a purse-string at the level of the azygos arch. b Removal of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph nodes distance, which made the surgical field of vision and mode of operation closer to the traditional thoracotomy.

            "text": "Our initial experience was as follows. Firstly, the esophagus and lymph nodes were dissected according to the fixed pattern, so that the operation process was more smoothly and the surgeon and assistant could cooperate more tacitly. Secondly, we applied various methods to free the esophagus during operation. For example, after complete dissociation of the middle and lower esophagus, a purse-string was inserted through the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the medial margin of scapula to tract the esophagus and so as to facilitate the dissociation of the upper esophagus and the clearance of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph nodes. When the tumor volume was relatively large, we used ribbon gauze to pull the normal esophagus at the upper and lower ends of the tumor, or we cut the esophagus with a cutting suture device to facilitate exposure and dissociation. Thirdly, the traditional instruments were improved during the operation. We used cotton thread to knot at the end of the elbow suction apparatus, which increased the friction between the suction apparatus and the esophageal tissues and facilitated the use of the suction apparatus to separate the esophagus. Fourthly, it was better to use a single-lumen tube and occluder in anesthesia, because the double-lumen tracheal intubation is thicker in diameter and harder in texture, which is not conducive to dissect the left recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node.",

            "text": "However, there are many limitations in single-port thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Firstly, it is more difficult to expose and free esophagus and mediastinal lymph nodes by single-hole thoracoscopic esophagectomy than by multi-hole thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Multiple instruments can easily interfere with each other in one incision. Secondly, the thoracic esophagus is located in the posterior mediastinum and begins at the top of the pleura and ends in the hiatus, which increases the difficulty of the operation. Thirdly, single-hole thoracoscopic esophagectomy may require a longer learning curve, which needs stricter risk prevention and control measures. Fourthly, single-hole thoracoscopic surgery should not be forced to perform for large tumors involving the adventitia of the esophagus. Therefore, we suggested that the early cases should be selected by uniportal thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Uniportal thoracoscopic esophagectomy is a more thorough and minimally invasive esophageal surgery. We believed that, with the development of endoscopic techniques and the accumulation of experience, more patients are expected to benefit from it.",
