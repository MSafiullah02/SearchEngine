Recent, unexpected outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, a member of the coronavirus family, and scares that an avian form of Influenza virus may become a pandemic threat, strengthen the opinion that members of any virus family can in principle turn into a life\u2010 and population\u2010threatening pathogen. Viruses are different from many other pathogens in that they fully depend on host cellular machineries for their replication and spread. The life cycle of a virus is therefore intricately intertwined with host cell biological processes at all stages, and these processes should not be seen separate from each other.",

It is clear that besides virus\u2010receptor binding, virus envelope fusion or capsid membrane penetration, and viral genome replication, not much else can be predicted with classical models of viruses. The fact that viruses of similar families can enter via completely different pathways, or that viruses from different families can enter via similar pathways, can only be understood and predicted if information is available from systematic and comprehensive studies on the cell biology behind virus entry. We predict that this will be a very important focus of future virology research, as it will allow us to formulate new ways of classifying viruses, namely according to the entry pathways and host machineries that they hijack, and to focus on a new type of antiviral treatments that target crucial host cellular components instead of viral components. The latter may not only lead to broad\u2010spectrum antiviral compounds, inhibiting the infectious entry of a range of ontologically different viruses that all rely on a similar entry route, but may also be less hampered by the development of viral resistance. Ideally, such research might in the future prepare us against all viruses by generating an arsenal of drugs that can inhibit all the potential entry routes. A quick analysis of the host genetic profile of a new emerging virus will immediately tell us which pathway is hijacked and which drug to take for antiviral treatment.",

The first steps towards digital imaging and image analysis were then taken by tracking the receptor mobility of univalent and multivalent fluorescent particles on the cell surface: LDL that binds to a well\u2010defined receptor, and influenza virus particles that bind to heterogenous sialic acid containing receptors. Analysis of the intensities of individual fluorescent spots permitted accurate determination of the particle position to within \u00b1 25 nm, revealing that LDL and influenza virus receptors displayed directed motion as well as motion restricted to a domain on the surface of dermal fibroblasts at 4\u00b0C (Anderson et al., 1992).",

By this technique, so\u2010called transient confinement zones (TCZ) were resolved in the plasma membrane of cells, zones of \u223c200\u2013300 nm in diameter in which particles, preferentially those attached to GPI\u2010anchored proteins and the glycosphingolipid GM1 were trapped for \u223c5\u201310 s (Simson et al., 1995; 1998; Sheets et al., 1997). On the basis of SPT, several groups have postulated that actin filaments on the cytosolic surface partition the plasma membrane into subcompartments, allowing rapid local diffusion of proteins and lipids within them but suppressing intercompartmental movement (Sheetz et al., 1980; Edidin et al., 1991; Sako and Kusumi, 1994).",

First, they were dependent on appropriate levels of cholesterol. Second, the tendency to reside in TCZs depended on the membrane molecule investigated: the GPI\u2010anchored protein Thy\u20101 and the glycosphingolipid GM1 had a significantly higher tendency to reside in TCZs as compared with non\u2010raft phospholipid analogues. Third, the mobility of particles was reduced as it entered a TCZ, likely caused by the diffusional restriction that the liquid\u2010ordered, cholesterol\u2010enriched phase imposed on them (Dietrich et al., 2002). Based on the finding that TCZs encompass cholesterol\u2010dependent liquid ordered regions of \u223c200 nm in dimension, a model has evolved in which the membrane\u2010apposed cytoskeleton provides a cytoskeletal barrier with transmembrane proteins linked to the underlying cytoskeleton constituting a picket (\u2018picket model\u2019). This barrier restricts the diffusion of GPI\u2010APs residing in the outer monolayer of the plasma membrane (Sheets et al., 1997). One alternative scenario involves the partitioning of the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane by the apposed actin filaments either actively through actin\u2010 and lipid\u2010binding proteins or passively by forming a grid on the inside surface of the plasma membrane, and thus preventing free diffusion of bulky proteins and complexes (\u2018fence\u2019 or \u2018corral\u2019 model) (Sako and Kusumi, 1994; Kusumi et al., 2005). Indeed, cytoskeletal components including actin, annexin and filamin were found associated with rafts and/or caveolae (Oliferenko et al., 1999; Stahlhut and van Deurs, 2000; Rodgers and Zavzavadjian, 2001).",

A combination of TIRF microscopy and single fluorescent particle tracking revealed different modes of motion of individual murine polyoma virus\u2010like particles (VLPs). Immediately after binding, the VLP\u2010receptor complex displayed 5\u201310 s of rapid, random diffusion, followed by its confinement to areas of 30\u201360 nm in diameter. Consistent with the \u2018picket\u2019 or the \u2018fence\u2019 model outlined above, this process was strictly dependent on a functional actin\u2010filament cytoskeleton. Thus, particle trajectories can provide information about the lateral mobility of membrane components and about constraints imposed on them by cytoskeletal elements, cholesterol\u2010rich microdomains or other structures that entail heterogeneity to the plasma membrane (Edidin et al., 1991; Sako and Kusumi, 1994; Dietrich et al., 2002; Ewers et al., 2005). However, it should be noted that viruses have multivalent binding sites and it is currently not understood how the valency of ligands influences their lateral mobility with respect to their partitioning properties into cholesterol\u2010rich microdomains.",

As such, digital time\u2010lapse fluorescence microscopy was used to simultaneously track individual influenza viruses and endocytic structures in living cells. Tracking of individual viruses and single clathrin\u2010coated pits (CCP) showed that the fraction of influenza viruses that exploited the clathrin\u2010mediated pathway was internalized through de novo formation of CCPs, which formed around the viruses 2\u20133 min after viral binding. Notably, the CCP formation rate was much higher at the sites of bound viruses than elsewhere on the cell surface, suggesting that the formation of CCP or the stabilization of tiny undetectable clathrin patches which may be randomly initiated, was a virus\u2010induced mechanism (Rust et al., 2004).",

A proportion of clathrin nucleation events were found to be short\u2010lived and collapsed unless they were stabilized as a consequence of cargo capture. Upon cargo capture, the intensity of a cargo\u2010loaded clathrin\u2010cluster grew at a steady state, and its size and the time required to complete clathrin assembly was determined by the size of the cargo (Ehrlich et al., 2004).",

However, the mechanism for transport from one endosomal compartment to another is still unsolved. Here, the vesicular transport model opposes the compartment maturation model in which the membrane composition of the cargo\u2010enclosing membrane progressively changes its composition (Griffiths and Gruenberg, 1991; Murphy, 1991; Schekman and Orci, 1996). Rink et al. combined fast live cell imaging techniques with new software tools to visualize and quantify the dynamics of membrane bound rab5 and rab7 during the transport of LDL from rab5\u2010positive early to rab7\u2010positive late endosomes. By tracking early endosomes over long periods of time and combining high\u2010speed 4D imaging with novel tracking algorithms the conversion from rab5 to rab7 was found to be the key mechanism for the remodelling of membrane identity and cargo progression between early and late endosomes. At the same time, degradative cargo became enriched in larger endosomes by repetitive fusion events that migrated from the cell periphery to the centre (Rink et al., 2005). However, in another study addressing the sorting of Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) from early to late endosomes using triple\u2010colour, video\u2010enhanced fluorescence microscopy in live cells, SFV progressed from rab5\u2010positive early endosomes to a population of early endosomes that contained rab5 and rab7. Sequestration of SFV in the rab7\u2010positive domain and subsequent detachment of the virus\u2010loaded rab7\u2010positive carrier vesicle targeted the cargo to late endosomes, favouring the vesicular transport model (Vonderheit and Helenius, 2005). More recently, Zhuang and colleagues proposed another model in which early endosomes are not comprised of a uniform pool of endocytic vesicles but instead constitute two populations that are characterized by distinct mobility and maturation kinetics. By a pre\u2010early endosome sorting mechanism at the plasma membrane, ligands destined for degradation are preferentially targeted to the smaller population of dynamic rapidly maturing early endosomes whereas ligands of the recycling pathway are non\u2010selectively targeted to all endosomes and effectively enriched in the larger population of static, slowly maturing early endosomes (Lakadamyali et al., 2006).",

Greber and colleagues were the first to show that SPT is a powerful technique to investigate the nuclear trafficking of fluorophore\u2010tagged virus particles in living cells by time\u2010lapse microscopy. They showed that after penetration of the endosomal membrane, Adenovirus particles engaged plus\u2010 and minus end\u2010directed motor activities that supported alternating minus\u2010 and plus end\u2010directed movements along microtubules, finally resulting in Ad2 accumulation near the microtubule\u2010organizing centre (MTOC) (Suomalainen et al., 1999). By a similar mechanism, the reverse transcription complex of HIV particles remained its interaction with microtubules after capsid dissociation and ultimately reached the MTOC from where it then could enter through nuclear pore complexes and integrate into the host DNA (McDonald et al., 2002).",

Association with a bidirectional transport apparatus allows them to travel either to sensory ganglia in order to establish latency or to peripheral tissue for reactivation from latency. A collection of recombinant pseudorabies viruses, an alphaherpesvirus of swine, expressing mRFP fused to a capsid protein, and GFP fused to one of five different viral tegument proteins, was tracked in axons of primary sensory neurons. The correlated motion between red and green fluorescence revealed that distinct composition of the capsid\u2010transport complex during entry and egress phases of infection controlled bidirectional capsid transport in axons. The tegument proteins VP1/2 and UL37 remained associated with capsids as they traveled toward the nucleus and may be responsible for the interaction with the host\u2019s transport machinery. Three other tegument proteins, VP16, VP13/14 and VP22 were found to be removed from the capsid surface before retrograde transport and their association with progeny capsids may direct viral egress to the periphery late in infection (Luxton et al., 2005). In another recent study an in vitro assay was developed that allows the analysis of the direct interaction between the viral capsid of herpes simplex virus type I with microtubules. This study showed that capsids exposing inner tegument proteins can recruit dynein and dynactin whereas capsids covered by outer tegument proteins or capsids devoid of tegument do not provide good substrates for transport along microtubules (Wolfstein et al., 2006).",

The time trajectories revealed that single influenza vRNPs were transported by diffusion, both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and directly interacted with the nuclear envelope via nuclear pore complexes, with dissociation rate constants ranging from 0.01 to 1 s\u22121. In the late stage of infection, when the regulatory influenza M1 protein is expressed, the interactions between the vRNPs and the nuclear envelope were significantly inhibited, suggesting that M1 downregulated the nuclear import of vRNPs by directly inhibiting its binding to NPCs (Babcock et al., 2004).",

Our next challenge will be to analyse the collective behaviour of all virus particles, and not just a few as has been done until now, and to identify the host components that govern the emerging physical properties of virus entry.

By comparing the involvement of the human complement of protein, lipid and carbohydrate kinases (the kinome) in the infectious entry of SV40 and VSV, we could reveal the host complexity behind these two entry routes. A remarkable finding was the limited overlap of kinases controlling both pathways. A unique set of 92 kinases specifically regulated VSV infectious entry, while a set of 80 kinases specifically regulated SV40 infectious entry. Moreover, of the 36 kinases that are involved in both infectious entry pathways, 23 (two\u2010third) have opposite effects, being required for one pathway, while suppressing another. We knew from previous studies that these viruses hijack different endocytic routes to enter their host cells (Pelkmans et al., 2001; Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003), but not to what extent the regulatory circuitry of the two routes would be different. Therefore, these observations not only strengthen our view of the existence of multiple endocytic routes operating in parallel, but also indicate that these routes are linked to very different physiological processes.",

It should be noted that the annotation of the human genome is currently very poor. Most human genes (approx. 70%) have no known function, while a few genes have been studied extensively, resulting in conflicting functional annotations for those genes. Nevertheless, we asked the question whether a group of kinases acting together in a particular signalling system, would have a similar effect on the activity of a particular virus entry pathway. Surprisingly, such links did indeed emerge from the large data sets. For instance, nutrient sensing specifically controls clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, and thus infectious entry of VSV, while cell adhesion signalling specifically controls caveolae/raft\u2010mediated endocytosis, and thus infectious entry of SV40. The systems of Ca2+\u2010signalling and the assembly/disassembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton were found to act oppositely on the two entry pathways. Cell cycle signalling mainly regulated clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis and VSV infectious entry, with little effect on caveolae/raft\u2010mediated endocytosis. See Pelkmans et al. (Pelkmans et al., 2005), for detailed information. In summary, this was the first time that a systems level view on the regulation of endocytosis and infectious virus entry was obtained, and illustrated how intricately these pathways are linked to various specific cellular processes.",

This becomes particularly interesting if the assays measure the infectious virus entry of a set of different viruses. Viruses with similar functional host genetic profiles are namely relying on the same host machineries and entry pathways. Because there is good evidence to suggest that a mammalian cell has a limited number of entry pathways, especially for viruses depending on endocytosis, it could become extremely useful to have a systematic approach to group viruses according to the pathway they hijack. Nowadays, it is relatively easy to group viruses according to their ontology by sequencing the genome of a virus, and is a standard diagnostic tool. However, as mentioned previously, the real complexity of infectious virus entry comes from the host components and machineries that are hijacked, which cannot be predicted from viral ontology. Setting up a system to group viruses according to \u2018host requirement ontology\u2019 would reveal which viruses hijack which entry pathways, and might be able to reveal the total number of virus entry pathways existing in mammalian cells. Furthermore, those host genes that are similarly involved in the infectious entry of all viruses of one group can be expected to represent the core machinery of the entry pathway, while those host genes that are uniquely or differently involved in the infectious entry of this group represent upstream and downstream variations of the commonly hijacked pathway. Upstream variations may represent virus receptors and specific signalling downstream from these receptors, while downstream variations might represent virus\u2010specific post\u2010entry mechanisms. It is clear that this will allow new types of analysis, and generate systems\u2010level views on endocytosis and virus entry.

For such viruses, it may be beneficial to determine the functional HOST genetic profile for infectious virus entry in several different cell types to determine those components that are commonly used. For instance, we observed that SV40 infectious entry in cells devoid of caveolin\u20101, which occurs via a caveolae\u2010independent endocytic route (Damm et al., 2005), is equally regulated by a same subset of kinases as in cells expressing caveolin\u20101 (Pelkmans et al., 2005). It may well be that while entry routes in different cell types do seem to differ in the dependence on some proteins or in their kinetics, they might actually not be that different when examined on a more global, or genome\u2010wide scale.",

All viruses, ontologically related or not, that enter via that pathway will be inhibited in their infectious entry using such a drug. Even more, if sets of drugs can be developed that can target all the possible entry pathways, we will be prepared in the rare case a virus can hijack an alternative route or is able to mutate drastically enough. And, we will be prepared for any new emerging virus. Once the functional host genetic profile of that virus is determined, and this can become a routine diagnostic approach in the future, we know which entry pathway it takes, and thus which antiviral drug to use.",

            "text": "In recent years, many technologies that were originally developed in other disciplines have found their way into research on the cell biology of virus entry. Several of them were discussed here, quantitative light microscopy and SPT, and functional genomics based on RNAi. These technologies, combined with computational image processing and analysis (Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005), bioinformatics, network biology (Ideker et al., 2001) and mathematical modelling (Dinh et al., 2006), are also the most promising to make cell biology a systems discipline. This is where the main challenges lie for the future. We can automatically track some virus particles, and obtain some quantitative parameters from their movement, but we are far from monitoring collective behaviour, and even further away from discovering the physical or mathematical principles that underlie collective behaviour. The same holds true for the collective behaviour of cellular membrane domains, vesicles and organelles (Dinh et al., 2006), which we need to understand in order to know the behaviour of virus particles that hijack these systems. In addition, we must obtain a comprehensive understanding of all the influences to which a system of moving particles and vesicles is exposed. Knowing the proteins, and understanding the molecular machineries, and their interactions to form functional modules (e.g. membrane microdomains, vesicle coats, organelle subdomains), will be a major step forward. Ultimately however, this understanding must be translated into the physical properties of the systems observed. A systematic annotation of the components with particular physical characteristics of a virus entry pathway will be very helpful to reach that goal, requiring a full integration of the main technologies that we have described here.",

Depicted is a schematic overview on the key processes in the multistep entry pathway of typical animal viruses. After attachment to receptors on the surface of their host cells, virus\u2010receptor complexes can undergo lateral movement. Often, a signal is activated that triggers the endocytic process leading to internalization of the virus. After internalization, viruses are passengers of intracellular trafficking pathways that deliver them to endosomes or caveosomes, where membrane penetration or vesicular sorting can take place. Microtubule\u2010mediated transport finally targets the virus particle or viral RNPs to the nuclear pore complex where the viral genome can be released into the nucleus. Single\u2010particle tracking combined with computational analysis and modelling has now emerged as a powerful tool to study most of these processes in quantitative terms.",

The specific components of a typical virus entry pathway (middle) are identified by comparative RNAi screens, which quantify infection efficiency of viruses that hijack different routes (left). Hierarchical clustering is used to statistically correlate different viruses according to the phenotypic RNAi profiles of all genes silenced. The more HOST genes are equally important for the infectious entry of a set of viruses, the more likely it is that these hijack similar entry routes. Thus, clustered \u2018functional host genetic profiles\u2019 generates groups of viruses that hijack similar pathways, according to \u2018host requirement ontology\u2019. Secondary RNAi screens of the identified components with quantitative light microscopy\u2010based assays are used to map the pathway in detail (right). The assays measure a series of physical parameters of the pathway, which generate quantitative information for the RNAi phenotype of each gene. Hierarchical clustering can also be used to statistically correlate different genes according to how their RNAi phenotype changes the different physical parameters. The more the combined changes across the whole series of physical parameters are similar between a set of genes, the more likely it is that these genes function together as so\u2010called \u2018functional modules\u2019. These functional modules will reflect machineries and signal cascades that underlie and control different parameters such as entry, membrane traffic, or membrane penetration.",
