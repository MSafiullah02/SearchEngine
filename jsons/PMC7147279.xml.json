The \u03b2-genus comprises OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV),[7] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).[8] Coronavirus has gradually become a popular topic of research in the field of virology because of the outbreak of SARSr-CoV in 2003 and MERSr-CoV in 2012.[9] The current outbreak is due to a novel coronavirus in the \u03b2-genus, which was isolated from the lower respiratory tract in patients with unexplained pneumonia, in Wuhan, China.[10,11] Currently, the source and pathogenesis of the COVID-19 remain unclear, and there are no uniform diagnostic and treatment standards. Unfortunately, in certain patients, the disease progresses rapidly, and respiratory failure can occur within a short time, even leading to death. Therefore, we investigated the disease outcomes and factors affecting the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan to provide a basis for improving hospitals\u2019 efforts to effectively treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

The median age of the patients was 38 (33, 57) years, which suggest that middle-aged people are susceptible to COVID-19. Also, the age of patients in the progression group was significantly higher than that in the improvement/stabilization group, and multivariate logistic analysis indicated that higher age was a risk factor for disease progression. Elderly individuals are physically frail and are likely to have several comorbidities, which not only increases the risk of pneumonia,[12] but also affects their prognosis.[13] The assessment of comorbidities is an essential component in determining the prognosis of several diseases, especially pneumonia.[14] Probably because of the small sample size, there was no significant difference in any comorbidity including hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cancer, and others between the two groups. The potential impact of comorbidities on the disease outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requires further observation and research. The proportion of patients with a history of smoking was significantly higher in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group, suggesting that smoking is associated with disease progression.",

Albumin is the most intuitive index of the nutritional status of the body. When albumin decreases, the body loses resistance to the virus, leading to disease progression.[16] Elevated C-reactive protein is an important inflammatory index in addition to abnormal blood coagulation function. Close monitoring of dynamic changes in these indices has a significant proactive effect on understanding changes in the patient's condition. In addition, studies have shown that lymphocytes are the main target cells of viral infections.[17] Viral infections in the human body primarily involve damage to the immune system, which presents as decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes.[18] The present study did not find these indices significant for assessing the outcome of COVID-19 patients, and their correlation requires further investigation. This study included CT scan characteristics of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for analysis and suggested that the extent and characteristics of the lesion had no statistical significance on disease outcomes. However, the use of CT scans at earlier stages for disease assessment is still of great significance for early detection, early diagnosis, and improved prognosis.",

Whether viral pneumonia should be treated with glucocorticoids has been controversial. Some researchers believe that the use of glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia can easily aggravate the disease and increase the risk of secondary infections, leading to an increase in mortality, thus advocating against the use of glucocorticoids.[20] Other studies have suggested that the use of an appropriate dose of glucocorticoids at early stages could inhibit the elevated secretion of inflammatory cytokines due to excessive activation of immune cells because of the viral infection, thereby preventing continued exacerbation of lung injury.[21] We found that the combination of anti-virals, anti-bacterials, and glucocorticoids had the highest use rate in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, other researchers have suggested using thymosin and gamma globulin during the early stages of infection to improve patient immunity. In addition, relevant ongoing studies suggest that COVID-19 and HIV have structural similarities. Thus, certain researchers have proposed that the anti-HIV drug, lopinavir, may play a role in inhibiting COVID-19. In this study, a comparison of efficacy of anti-virals/anti-bacterials, anti-virals/anti-bacterials + glucocorticoids, anti-virals/anti-bacterials + gamma globulin, anti-virals/anti-bacterial + thymosins, and anti-virals/anti-bacterials + lopinavir was performed. The results did not suggest that drug protocols affected disease outcomes. Therefore, further studies should include more drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by an acute onset and rapid progression. Therefore, the early use of glucocorticoids with proactive anti-viral and anti-bacterial treatment after comprehensive evaluation may block the inflammatory cascade caused by severe viral infections and prevent acute inflammation. The lung damage caused by such infections can further progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory support is an essential treatment for patients with severe viral infections. The present study revealed that all patients with COVID-19 were treated with respiratory support, and the majority of patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen and continuous positive air pressure. The progression group was significantly more likely to receive higher levels of respiratory support. No patients in this study were treated with invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to the refusal of the patients\u2019 family. When treating patients with severe viral pneumonia, timely application of glucocorticoids and respiratory support therapy is essential, in combination with personalized treatment specific to each patient.",
