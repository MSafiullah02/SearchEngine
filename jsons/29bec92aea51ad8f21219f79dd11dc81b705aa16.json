However, the implementation aspect of strategy has attracted relatively less scholarly interest than strategic planning despite its critical role in achieving performance outcomes. Consequently, it is timely to provide an in-depth analysis of the strategy implementation literature. This is particularly the case in hospitality and tourism management where comprehensive literature reviews of strategy implementation have been lacking. To address the knowledge gap, the authors conduct a systematic literature review of 139 articles that appeared in 42 journals over the period 1988-2019. The items were grouped into six topic clusters with a view to generating novel research questions that have the potential to advance the field. We identify four main gaps that should be addressed and suggest prospective research directions.",

A different though comparable challenge involves how strategies can be executed across whole organizations. The dependence of successful strategizing on the effectiveness of implementation is rather self-evident (Hrebiniak, 2006) . Organizations across all economic sectors face the challenge of achieving consistent strategy formulation, and without effective implementation will struggle to reach their intended targets (Brenes et al., 2008) . Superior performance will only be achieved when strategies are effectively implemented. While strategic planning has been one of the most commonplace tools in management (Wolf & Floyd, 2017) , implementation related problems (Verweire, 2014) have frequently impeded its effectiveness Although strategy implementation occupies a critical space between strategic planning and performance outcomes, its scholarly appeal has been overshadowed by the formulation aspect of strategy. While researchers have proposed abundant theories and techniques about how to plan effectively, they have devoted less attention to the relationship between strategy implementation and performance outputs (Hrebiniak, 2006) .",

However, challenges remain despite this considerable scholarly output. Strategy implementation is multi-faceted and encompasses a multitude of activities that are undertaken by different levels of management (Noble, 1999) . The multi-dimensional nature of the implementation concept has opened up alternative paths of investigation and has led to a fragmentation of the research domain (Yang et al., 2010) . In parallel to the developing literature, practitioners have been embracing new approaches to strategy implementation, thereby adding complexity and indiscipline to the existing knowledge base (Vaara & Whittington, 2012) . As the body of knowledge has continued to grow, there has been an increasing need to consolidate and organize the sum of scholarly insights Noting the combined growth of interest in and around the topic and a fragmentation in the research area, we believe that it is timely to consolidate and integrate the strategy implementation literature in hospitality and tourism management. We propose a \"state-of-the-art\" evaluation of the strategy implementation literature in hospitality and tourism with a view to advancing debate and asking the following meaningful questions that can be considered by future researchers: 1) What are the key features and trends of the strategy implementation literature in hospitality and tourism management?",

Through such means, review studies play a critical role in guiding future research (Cropanzano, 2009) . Furthermore, an increasing number of scholars have drawn attention to the importance of literature reviews to management which acknowledgment which acknowledges a base of evidence (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008; Rynes & Bartunek, 2017) . Briner, Denyer & Rousseau (2009) have noted that systematic literature reviews are particularly valuable forms of evidence-based knowledge which can inform policy makers and practitioners. In this regard, our study makes several prospective contributions to hospitality and tourism knowledge. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the only literature review conducted over the past two decades on the subject of strategy implementation in hospitality and tourism. Given the crucial role of strategy implementation in achieving performance outcomes (Hrebiniak, 2006; Brenes et al., 2008) , examining how the literature has developed over an extended timespan has important scholarly and managerial implications.

Along similar lines Schaap (2006) , defined strategy implementation as 'those senior-level leadership behaviors and activities that will transform a working plan into a concrete reality' (p.14). Other studies have attempted to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f provide a more comprehensive view of strategy implementation, notably as the 'post-authorization phase of a strategic decision' (Anchor & Aldehayyat, 2016, p. 649) . Another proposed definition has considered the whole organization as follows: 'the communication, interpretation, adoption, and enactment of strategic plans' (Noble, 1999) . Most conventional approaches have adopted a temporal sequencing approach towards the three elements of strategic planning, formulation and implementation. Following this approach strategy is first formulated and then implemented.",

On the other hand, Zott and Amit (2008) claim that performance is influenced by the fit between strategy and the prevailing business model. Another key managerial consideration is how to measure and evaluate performance during and after strategy implementation. The control function evidently occupies a critical position. Henri (2006) examined the relationship between management control systems J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and implementation success and suggests that an interactive use of performance measurement systems is significant in translating strategy into organizational performance.",

The stakeholder theory perspective views a company as a set of relationships amongst groups that have a stake in that business (Jones, 1995) . Stakeholder theory asserts the critical importance of managing these relationships for the creation and distribution of value (Freeman, 1984) . It views stakeholders as playing a significant role as influencers of strategic decisions (Rodgers & Gago, 2004; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008) . From these observations, it is evident that stakeholder theory provides a useful lens for examining strategy implementation issues from a relational perspective. Most of the articles in our sample that used stakeholder theory are focused on the implementation of tourism and/or destination management strategies. One explanation for the popularity of stakeholder relationships as a topic in strategy implementation research is the necessity of assembling the collective efforts of various bodies to implement such plans. Comparatively speaking, stakeholder J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f theory has not been a popular framework in mainstream strategic management studies and scholarly interest has only increased recently (Laplume et al., 2008; Bridoux & Stoelhorst, 2014) .",

At best, it may be concluded that hospitality and tourism articles provided provisional theoretical contributions.",

Then minimal research on the governance of strategy implementation consists of two articles on balanced scorecard applications and a single article on corporate boards.

This approach provided a useful tool for the authors to place hospitality and tourism studies within the wider field of strategic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f management research. According to this framework, research articles fit into one of three phases: nascent, intermediate or mature. The following section presents the characteristics of the various phases and how our sample fits into theEdmondson & McManus's (2007) framework.",

            "text": "The second gap concerns theoretical perspectives. The current literature has deployed a narrow range of theoretical frameworks to address a limited range of important topics. Future studies may use new theoretical frameworks such as resource dependence theory or new institutional theory to shed light on implementation related topics. For example, resource dependence theory may prove useful when examining how hospitality businesses implement strategies to manage their resource dependencies with the external environment. Meanwhile, institutional theory may add new insights about how strategy implementation practices are influenced by different institutional arrangements in various contexts. On the other hand, future studies can also apply previously used theories to new topics. For example, agency theory may be deployed to examine the principal-agent relationships between company headquarters and foreign branches in hotel chains.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThe third gap relates to methodology. Most of the studies which provide explicit expression of their preferred methods use single case studies. More variation is needed in terms of research methods if relevant issues are to be addressed accurately. Where case studies are used they should extend multiple cases in order to enable comparison within samples. Secondly, our overall findings about the research life cycle have shown that strategy implementation research in hospitality and tourism remains immature. More testing of theory is needed to move this research area towards maturity. It was also striking that explorative studies have been used intensively, though no suggestive theory has been produced for the area. Those conducting future explorative studies should aim to make a stronger theoretical contribution. We also observed that hybrid data were only used in a small number of studies. The deployment of mixed research methods might enable researchers to provide more significant theoretical contributions. To date, even theory testing studies did not express their theoretical approach explicitly or state the theories that were being tested. Future studies should give greater prominence to the refinement of methodologies and clearer articulation of research aims.The fourth type of gap in the literature pertains to research content. Strategy implementation studies should address emerging trends that are likely to affect the future of strategy implementation. Advances in information technologies, artificial intelligence and big data are among the top trends that will cause long-lasting changes to the implementation of strategy in hospitality and tourism. Such topics evidently offer fruitful research avenues for the future.Another under-researched subject is the organizational governance of strategy implementation.Governance related articles in the literature generally focused on relationships with external stakeholders. However, governance mechanisms for strategy implementation inside the organization did not receive the attention that they deserved. Future researchers should address overlooked issues such as control mechanisms, implementation tools, corporate politics and powerJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relations among related actors. A largely neglected area of content was the assessment of implementation performance. Measuring implementation performance serves an important function in strategy evaluation and therefore deserves more interest from future researchers. A final research domain for potential contributions is the development of new strategy implementation frameworks for hospitality organizations. The topic clusters and the research life cycle framework offer novel insights about optimal research directions. The four types of gap in the literature and possible future research questions are presented in",
