Here, we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes. Previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations; two explanations for this pattern are that (1) migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats (i.e., migratory escape), and (2) long-distance migration weeds out infected animals (i.e., migratory culling). We combined field-sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms. Analysis of within-breeding-season variation in eastern North America showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape. Prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity, as indexed by larval density. Among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway, parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in Mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period. Collectively, these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations, with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations.",

Despite the pervasiveness of animal migrations and their often spectacular nature, their dynamical consequences for host-parasite interactions remain largely unknown. Long-distance movements could facilitate the geographic spread of pathogens (Henien and Merriam 1990, Riley 2007) , including those with human health impacts such as SARS-related coronaviruses in bats (Dobson 2005 , Li et al. 2005 ) and avian influenza viruses in waterfowl and shorebirds (Kilpatrick et al. 2006, Garamszegi and M\u00f8ller 2007) . Some modeling studies indicate that host dispersal could facilitate widespread epidemics (Busvine 1993 , Hess 1996 , whereas others show that host movements can prevent population extinction in the face of a debilitating pathogen and allow host resistance genes to spread (Carlsson-Graner and Thrall 2002, Gog et al. 2002) . However, most theory on migration and infectious disease dynamics has focused on undirected, short-distance dispersal, rather than on regular, directed movements that characterize seasonal migration.",

Two mechanisms could cause this association. First, if parasites accumulate in the hosts' environment over time, migration could allow animals to escape from contaminated habitats (''migratory escape''; Loehle 1995) . This mechanism predicts that prolonged use of habitats allows parasite transmission stages to build up in the environment over time, such that migrating animals might therefore leave behind contaminated habitats. Unfavorable environmental conditions, combined with a lack of hosts, could represent a bottleneck for remaining parasites, and hosts returning to these habitats after an extended absence could encounter largely disease-free conditions (Loehle 1995) .",

Monarchs occur worldwide and populations vary widely in migratory behaviors. Here we focus on the eastern North American monarch population, which migrates annually to Mexico. Because this migration is similar in timing, duration, and distance to that of many other migratory animals, this host-pathogen system represents a relevant model to ask how seasonal migration impacts infectious disease dynamics. We test the following predictions: (1) Parasite prevalence increases from early to late in the breeding season, possibly as a result of increasing parasite transmission associated with sequential host generations on the same breeding grounds, consistent with the migratory escape hypothesis. (2) Parasite prevalence decreases as monarchs progress southward during their fall migration, with the lowest prevalence expected at Mexican overwintering sites as compared to breeding areas, consistent with the migratory culling hypothesis.",

Parasites can be transferred vertically, from infected adults to their progeny, and horizontally, when butterflies scatter spores that are ingested by unrelated larvae (Altizer et al. 2004 , De Roode et al. 2009 ).

Gulf coastal regions of southern Florida, Louisiana, and Texas below 308 N latitude were not included in our analyses, as monarchs in these locations could breed year-round and thus may be nonmigratory. We further classified observations into three time intervals within each year, hereafter called breeding phases: early (15 April-30 June), middle (1 July-14 August), and late (15 August-31 October). Within each phase and region, we estimated average parasite prevalence from MH data, and calculated average weekly monarch density (number of larvae reported/ milkweed stalks examined) from MLMP data (SAS Institute 2004; PROC SQL). Because MH samples were collected from adults and MLMP density estimates were based on observations of larvae, we corrected for the time lag in host development by adding two weeks to the date of larval density estimates before assigning breeding-phase classifications (assuming that monarchs require approximately 14 days to develop from mid-or late-instar larvae to adults under average summer temperatures; Zalucki 1982) .",

To be conservative, our response variable was average weekly density for each regionphase combination, and we weighted models by sample size to account for variation in the number of MLMP volunteers reporting data from each region-phase combination. To examine how changes in parasite prevalence covaried with host density, we used a generalized linear model with binomial errors and a built-in temporal autocorrelation function combining data from MH and MLMP data sets (SAS, PROC GLIMMIX). Specifically, we assumed that both prevalence and density estimates followed a time-decaying covariance process, so that correlations within each variable decreased linearly over time by using the RANDOM statement with a first-order autoregressive process. Lastly, we fit linear regressions to the relationship between parasite prevalence (MH) and host density (MLMP) within each region separately.

Thus, larvae could ingest spores deposited by their own parents, or by unrelated adults. Moreover, OE spores can persist for years in a laboratory environment (S. M. Altizer, unpublished data), and ingestion of even a single spore can cause heavy infections in adult butterflies (De Roode et al. 2007 ). These factors could cause rapid increases in infection among monarchs that use the same milkweed patches in multiple overlapping generations. Consistent with this idea, field-collected milkweed host plants from and monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) larval density (right-hand panels) both increase over time across three breeding-season phases (described in Methods) in three geographic regions (Midwest, Northeast, and South; Appendix B) for eastern North American migratory monarchs from 2006 to 2009.

Sample sizes for parasite prevalence are the number of adult monarchs sampled; sample sizes for larval density are the number of sites sampled with milkweeds. Parasite prevalence was determined as the proportion of heavily infected adult monarchs (those having .100 spores), based on Project Monarch Health (MH) citizen science data. Larval density was measured from MLMP data as described in Methods. For general linear models, estimates of host density were log-transformed but are shown here as untransformed values.",

One possible, but untested, explanation for the lack of association between larval density and parasite prevalence in the South is host plant distribution. Because density is reported on a per-milkweed-stalk basis, it is possible that areas with less abundant milkweed could have high numbers of larvae per stalk, independent of the region-wide abundance of monarchs. Whether or not variation in host plant distribution and the resulting density of monarchs on individual plants could cause regional differences in monarch density-parasite prevalence associations requires further investigation, and we recently modified MLMP data reporting protocols to allow future studies on this topic. Support for migratory escape has been provided by work on other host-parasite systems, including sea lice infesting Pacific salmon (Krko\u0161ek et al. 2005 (Krko\u0161ek et al. , 2006 , where human interference with the salmons' natural migration has exposed wild juvenile fish to high concentrations of parasites (Costello 2006 , Krko\u0161ek et al. 2007 ).

Because OE infection causes reduced adult body size, shorter adult life span (De Roode et al. 2007 , and reduced flight performance (Bradley and Altizer 2005) , we expect that a high proportion of heavily infected monarchs will be removed from the population during long-distance migrations. Our results here showed that parasite prevalence decreased as monarchs moved southward along the east coast during their annual fall migrations, consistent with the idea that infected animals were less able to reach the southernmost sites. Moreover, prevalence among eastern adults sampled at the end of the breeding season was greater than for overwintering monarchs sampled after they successfully reached Mexico. It is important to note that at overwintering sites, little to no population recruitment occurs, and hence no vertical transmission. Instead, parasite prevalence can decline further as a result of mortality of infected hosts (Altizer et al. 2000) . Previous work detected differences in the prevalence of heavily infected adults during breeding, migration, and overwintering periods in western, but not in eastern, North America (Altizer et al. 2000) . Here, we provide a more detailed analysis of a longer-term and more spatially complete data set for eastern migratory monarchs.",

Simmons and Rogers (1991) demonstrated that armyworms infected by an ectoparasitic nematode had compromised migratory ability, such that males recolonizing sites as they return north contained few or no nematodes. Recent work on Bewick's Swans also showed that low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses delayed migration and reduced travel distances (van Gils et al. 2007 ). Because migration is energetically demanding or stressful (Alerstam et al. 2003) , long-distance movements have been proposed to increase susceptibility to parasites through immunosuppression. Evidence includes increased susceptibility to low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses (Garamzegi and M\u00f8ller 2007, Weber and Stilianakis 2007) and relapses of Lyme disease spirochetes (Gylfe et al. 2000) in migratory birds. In cases where hosts harbor latent infections and the physiological stress of migration causes those infections to erupt, this could ultimately remove infected hosts and lower the prevalence of disease, as animals with severe infections most likely do not migrate successfully.",

Collectively, these have caused the monarchs' annual migration to be considered a ''threatened phenomenon'' (Brower and Malcolm 1991) . At the same time, local pockets of winterbreeding monarchs have appeared sporadically along the Gulf coast and the southern Atlantic coast in recent years (Howard et al., in press) , possibly owing to mild climates and the planting of tropical milkweeds that produce vegetation year-round. Ultimately, if the large eastern migratory population declines and year-round breeding monarchs expand, this could lead to greater disease prevalence and reductions in overall population health.",

            "text": "Declines in movement or interruption of migratory patterns could have enormous impacts on many migratory species. For example, migratory insects account for more total moving biomass than the largest groups of migratory mammals or birds (Holland et al. 2006) , and contribute to crucial ecosystem services such as crop pollination, nutrient cycling, and pest control (Wilcove and Wikelski 2008) . Migratory vertebrates such as birds, salmon, and antelope (Wilcove and Wikelski 2008) have all suffered severe and often sustained population declines and reductions in movement. It is possible that the ''fading glory'' of animal migrations (Wilcove and Wikelski 2008) will affect hostparasite interactions across a broad range of taxa, in some cases presenting additional risks for migratory populations. Pathogen-driven wildlife declines and extinction are increasingly evident (for a comprehensive review, see de Castro and Bolker 2005). Thus, understanding how human activities that alter host migratory patterns (either by breaking migration pathways or through the loss of breeding or wintering sites) influence parasite dynamics in wild animal populations will help guide conservation and management of migratory species and the ecological processes associated with these movement patterns.",
