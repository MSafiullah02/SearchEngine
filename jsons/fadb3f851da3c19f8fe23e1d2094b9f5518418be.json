During this time of social and economic despair, global healthcare systems are under critical strain due to severe shortages of hospital beds and medical equipment. Patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( Fig. 1) , are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a fraction will require high-level respiratory support to survive [2] . Additionally, significant strain has been placed on personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies required to protect the healthcare workers helping to treat critically ill patients during this pandemic. At the time of writing, there are active disruptions of medical supply chains throughout Europe and in the United States at the hospital level, particularly in the states of New York and Washington.",

Crucially, venturi valves, key components of such respiratory support equipment [3] proved difficult to reproduce or substitute in the setting of these shortages. While venturi valve design is subject to copyright and patent covers, certain emergencies resulting in life-or-death decisions may justify full use regardless of intellectual property, in the appropriate clinical setting. This critical demand has resulted in the 3D printing community of physicians and engineers at a local Italian startup Isinnova successfully developing methods for manufacturing these valves to bolster local supply [4] . Additional methods of bolstering local ventilator supply include the use of a single ventilator for multiple patients with a 3D printed ventilator splitter. Fortunately, the US FDA does not object to the creation and use of certain devices such as the T-connector that meet specifications described in the instructions provided to the FDA for use in placing more than one patient on mechanical ventilation when the number of patients who need invasive mechanical ventilation exceeds the supply of available ventilators and the usual medical standards of care have been changed to crisis care in the interest of preserving life. The FDA's \"no objection\" policy in this regard applies during the duration of the declared COVID-19 emergency.",

The reverse-engineered 3D printable model of the Isinnova valve is not widely available at the time of writing, with the authors maintaining the position that such resources should be adequately evaluated and used only when such equipment is not available from the original manufacturers. Ongoing efforts by the engineers at Isinnova are focusing on developing creative adaptations of existing products for respiratory support, for example by adapting a snorkelling mask into a non-invasive ventilator [5] . Most recently, non-adjustable venturi valve designs were developed and made available by the GrabCAD user Filip Kober [6]. These valve designs achieve specific levels of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) at set rates of supplemental oxygen supply (Fig. 2) . Model porosity may inadvertently alter intended FiO 2 levels, requiring the use of printing technologies that ensure airtight parts.",

While sourcing ventilators and ventilator parts from existing manufacturers is the clearly preferred option when feasible, the supply of these crucial devices is inadequate in many areas. A solution currently being applied to this challenge in Europe and the United States is the creation of 3D printed ventilator splitters and adjustable flow control valves, such as the no2covid-ONE valve, to be able to adapt a single ventilator for use with multiple patients who have different oxygen requirements [7]. We anticipate new creative solutions for such increasingly complex challenges from emerging international open source design efforts such as the Montreal General Hospital Foundation Code Life Ventilator Challenge [8] as the COVID-19 health crisis emerges.",

This mask can be printed with Polyactic Acid (PLA) filament as a flat piece, and is intended to be subsequently manually assembled into its final three-dimensional configuration after heating to a temperature of 55-60\u00b0C (131-140\u00b0F) via forced hot air (e.g. a hairdryer) or by submerging it in hot water (Fig. 3) . Crucially, all seams must be manually sealed to ensure an airtight fit. The mask includes a simple air intake port into which two reusable filters may be inserted, with a screw-in cover to hold the filters in place. This design Fig. 2 Open-source non-adjustable Venturi valve design for an FiO2 of 33% at supplemental oxygen flow rate of 10 l per minute. The cross-sectional view (above) demonstrates the inner structure of this device with a small oxygen port (light blue) and a larger air intake (left) has several drawbacks. Due to the flat design, only one mask can be printed at a time on most desktop printers, limiting throughput. Practically, our initial tests demonstrate difficulties folding these masks created using conventional PLA filament, with significant gaps along the seams that are difficult to mitigate. If successfully sealed, the mask may provide limited airflow for some users and a second breathing port, achievable by mirrorimaging the port-bearing half of the mask, may need to be added. As a result of multiple limitations, this mask is currently undergoing revisions by the original designer.",

A similar design has been proposed by the Chinese company Creality [12], with a different configuration of the filter holder, intended for insertion of layers of folded fabric or filters (Fig. 5) . The Creality goggles require separately sourcing transparent plastic inserts, which may be obtained from repurposed household items. As with all masks, judicious testing for seal adequacy and experimentation with sizing and materials are required for implementation. The Lowell Makes mask is a variant of the replaceable front filter design which offers the benefit of printing without supports or adhesion [13] (Fig. 6) . The mask is intended to be lined with a foam padding on the inside. While addition of elements such as foam padding to reusable PPE like the Lowell Makes mask improves user comfort, this may impact the selection of sterilization approaches and must be considered carefully.",

Initial testing of the preferred/available disinfection mode may be conducted prior to scaling up manufacture, in consultation with local hospital policies and consideration of disinfection material availability. Ensuring compatibility with widely available common household chlorine-based or hydrogen peroxide-based compounds may be prudent for individual users. In all cases, consultation with local hospital guidelines regarding the frequency, nature, and acceptability of disinfection and sterilization of reusable equipment should be followed. For devices requiring sterilization, manufacturer specifications for printing materials should be consulted. For example, 3D printed nasal swabs needed to expand testing in the US must not only be safe and provide adequate sample, but also must be sterilized and packaged appropriately for testing and eventual clinical use. Where available, limited physical impact methods such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma or ionizing radiation may be the preferred means of sterilization, since alternative methods such as autoclaving may deform the printed parts.",
