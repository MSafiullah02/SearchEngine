This report is the outcome of result of collaboration between the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, STOPAIDS, and Global Justice Now and Just Treatment. The report identifies gaps of the current health innovation system and sets principles for a new model. It proposes concrete policy actions that can be taken in the long term to actively shape and co-create a health system that delivers real public value. The report is structured into two sections. The first is \"diagnosis\" with chapters on \"Problems with the current health innovation system\" and \"Principles for a health innovation model that delivers public value.\" The second section, \"remedies,\" includes chapters on \"Immediate policy actions: Getting better prices today\" and \"Transformative proposals: Re-imagining our health innovation system to deliver public value.\" The report focuses on the unethical and unacceptable current global scenario for health innovation, highly inefficient, with a pharmaceutical industry that makes billions in profits without providing the affordable products that people need. The report examines all those problems, and then it sets out some key principles of how a \"healthy\" innovation model for health would work, based on an analysis of case studies from different countries and different contexts, looking at where innovation has been done well.

Another example are the tests using hybrid flagelins also in malaria vaccines. Adjuvants have emerged thus as an alternative route for vaccine development with enormous potential in the global market (Mbow et al. 2010) . The development of new, powerful, and safe adjuvants is therefore a key component of vaccine research. We present in Table 14 .3 some of licensed vaccine adjuvants, with company and class. Figure 14 .2 indicates the countries concentrating patent deposits for adjuvants to vaccine compositions and the diseases related to them (Zika, dengue, HIV/AIDS, influenza), China (34%), the USA (24%), South Korea (9%), and the UK (8%), with these three countries accounting for nearly 75% of all patent deposits. It is also observed that chikungunya had no deposit in the period from 2000 to 2018, as indicated the Espacenet base.

It also indicates that most of these adjuvant deposits are concentrated in vaccine compositions related to just two diseases, influenza (80%) and HIV/AIDS (15.6%), while Zika, followed by dengue, is more neglected. The increasing risk of a pandemic of influenza, rapidly affecting all continents, might explain the concentration of R&D efforts on vaccine compositions and adjuvants for this disease.
