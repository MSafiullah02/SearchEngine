Early detection of a viral etiology of a LRTI in a febrile transplant recipient can theoretically reduce the use of antibiotics, trigger modification of immunosuppression and prompt appropriate isolation procedures to reduce nosocomial infections. We retrospectively evaluated pediatric abdominal organ transplant recipients hospitalized with respiratory illnesses to determine the viral pathogens identified by various methods including multiplex RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates. Among 30 symptomatic subjects (median age, 2.5 yr) evaluated using this methodology, 25 (83%) were positive for at least one virus. Rhinovirus was the most frequently identified virus (14 subjects).
