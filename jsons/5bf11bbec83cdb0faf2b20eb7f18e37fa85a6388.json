Although many respiratory tract infections are nonlife-threatening, they are associated with a significant level of morbidity. The oral cavity acts as a portal of entry and as a reservoir for many bacterial, viral and fungal species. Here these microorganisms gain access to interlinked airways, composed of mucosal epithelia, which collectively comprise the respiratory tract. This large mucosal surface area acts as a reservoir for infectious particles that are inhaled. There is good evidence to show that improved oral hygiene and frequent professional healthcare can reduce the progression or occurrence of respiratory diseases, especially amongst high-risk patient groups (4) .",

Organisms must first negotiate the nonspecific mechanisms in the upper respiratory tract, which include a mechanical washing mechanism, the cough response, anatomic barriers and the mucociliary tree. Additional barriers in the lower respiratory tract include the frequent branching of the pulmonary tree (to effect aerodynamic filtration) and the restrictive size (0. 3-5. 0 lm) of the alveolus opening. Once microorganisms reach the alveolus they must resist the activity of phagocytes, immune response cells and other antimicrobial defence factors. If these microorganisms can overcome or subvert the innate host defences, such as the mucociliary system, bronchoconstriction, cough reflex or acquired immunity (mucosal immunoglobulin A), then the infectious process can begin. Infections may be acute or chronic, and lower respiratory tract infections may be limited to the bronchial tree (bronchitis) or the lung alveoli (pneumonia), or involve both (broncho-pneumonia).",

Optochin sensitivity distinguishes S. pneumoniae from possible viridans group streptococci. Serotyping is conducted using coagglutination methods (94) . In addition to these methods, multilocus sequence typing can be conducted for enhanced surveillance of the relationships between sequence types and serotypes of pneumococci (114) .",

Of the six capsular antigenic types of H. influenzae, capsulate strain type b is responsible for more than 90% of human infections and is an important cause of pneumonia and meningitis, although many nonencapsulated strains also cause disease. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, Chile and The Gambia, deaths from H. influenzae pneumonia greatly outnumber deaths from meningitis. The disease burden of H. influenzae is estimated at 3,000,000 serious illnesses per year and 386,000 deaths (111) . The majority of victims are less than 5 years of age, and following the decline of maternal antibodies, children 4-18 months of age are most vulnerable. Epidemiologic studies have documented that H. influenzae nasopharyngeal colonization rates vary between 25 and 80% in humans (103), with higher rates for children than for adults. Anticapsular antibodies are good opsonins, allowing bacteria to be phagocytosed and killed. These antibodies are T-cell independent and are not produced until the child is 2-3 years of age.",

These two surface antigens undergo gradual, progressive antigenic variation as a result of spontaneous mutation, with minor changes in the hemagglutinin (antigenic drift) that allows the viruses to escape host immunity and cause further outbreaks, typically of mild disease in the winter months. Pandemics involve the emergence of new influenza A subtypes in the human population, caused by major genetic re-assortment of the RNA segment that codes for the viral surface hemagglutinin (antigenic shift), creating a new virus to which human populations have little or no protection (49) .",

There have subsequently been cases of A \u2044 H5N1 influenza across South-East Asia, Russia, Europe, Africa, India and the Middle East. The total number of human cases of A \u2044 H5N1 to date is low, because the current strain is not efficiently transmitted from human to human. By October 2007, the World Health Organization had confirmed 331 cases from 12 countries, of which 109 were in Indonesia and 100 were in Vietnam. Of these 331 cases, 202 patients died, a case fatality rate of 61%. Thus, human disease caused by H5N1 follows an aggressive course, in which primary viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure are common. Furthermore, most cases to date have been in previously healthy children and adults. Therefore, the concern is for major mortality globally if, through genetic reassortment, a strain emerges that is readily transmitted between humans, resulting in a pandemic. The combination of vaccines (20, 57) and the anti-viral drugs oseltamivir and zanamir (21) will be utilized in an attempt to reduce the impact of a pandemic, but case numbers and deaths are still expected to be extremely high, with massive social and societal impact.",

            "text": "Aspergillus are opportunistic, filament-forming molds from a genus comprising over 180 spp, of which A. fumigatus is responsible for the majority of human Aspergillus infections (53) . Aspergillus spp are universally distributed and are found in soil and other organic matter. Four other Aspergillus spp cause most of the remaining cases of aspergillosis, namely Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus nidulans. A. terreus is associated with high mortality. A. flavus may cause sinusitis more commonly. A. niger is a more frequent colonizing species and is commonly associated with external otitis. A. nidulans is particularly associated with infection in chronic granulomatous disease (5) . A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus with a worldwide distribution, which is a result, in part, of the production of small spores called conidia that have an average size of 2-3.5 lm. These are easily dispersed into the air and remain in the atmosphere for prolonged periods of time, but are dependent upon the external environment, such as temperature, humidity and seasonal variations (108) . The spores of A. fumigatus have a hydrophobic protein-coat layer, which may enable them to withstand host defences and harsh environments. In addition, their very small size enables penetration deep into the lung, particularly A. fumigatus. All Aspergillus spp also form hyphae, which are septate and hyaline. This is one of the key virulence factors of Aspergillus and is required for tissue invasion. A. fumigatus grows the most rapidly, is extremely thermotolerant, and binds laminin and fibrinogen more efficiently than other species of Aspergillus, making it a-well adapted pathogen. The morphology and colour of the conidiophores vary between species (59).",

The presence of acute dichotomous branching septate filamentous forms invading tissue combined with a pure culture is diagnostic (115) . Chest radiographic features are also important, but not in the early stages of disease. Signs include bronchopneumonia, consolidation, segmental pneumonia, multiple nodules, masses, cavitary lesions and pleural effusion. Computed tomography scans of the chest reveal multiple nodules and the characteristic halo sign. Culture from bronchoalveloar lavage often provides a useful indicator of infection and adjunct to other diagnostic tests (5) . More recent advances have seen the use of galactomannan detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Galactomannan is a cell wall polysaccharide that can be detected in blood at levels as low as 0.5 ng \u2044 ml, and prior to the development of clinical signs. However, although it provides a high negative predictor of infection, it is limited by a poor positive predictive value as a result of cross-reactivity with other species and \u2044 or foodstuffs. Beta-D-glucan is another recent antigenic detection test that appears a promising addition to the diagnostic arsenal. Prospective clinical trials are necessary to evaluate this technology further. The PCR is a further test that is currently under development, which may offer both high specificity and sensitivity (53) . However, distinguishing infection from colonization, and optimizing specimen collection, are problematic.",

Aspergilloma may be treated surgically, but this has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. For an aspergilloma, percutaneous administration with amphotericin B may be performed, but some studies show no apparent benefit. Conversely, itraconazole shows limited success because of its high tissue penetration. In terms of invasive aspergillosis (IA), amphotericin B has been the first-line therapy for aspergillosis for many years, but is associated with serious side effects, such as nephrotoxicity. However, liposomal formulations of these have been introduced that have fewer side effects (29) . Voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole, has recently been approved for the treatment of IA because it has more favourable outcomes than amphotericin B and fewer side effects. Other azoles include posaconazole, which may be used as salvage therapy when conventional antifungals fail. The echinocandins such as caspofungin, which are cell wall inhibitors, have been introduced and used for salvage therapy (32) .",

It is initially inhaled prior to causing the disease coccoccosis, affecting immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS, immune deficiencies, cancer, steroid use and diabetes (88) . It possesses a characteristic polysaccharide capsule of variable thickness (up to 30 lm) that surrounds the yeasts. Within the environment the capsule is thinner and the yeast smaller, while thicker capsules tend to be found in infected tissues. The polysaccharide capsule, the phenoloxidase enzyme and the organism\u00d5s ability to grow at 37\u00b0C, are its major virulence factors (78) . Respiratory manifestations of the disease can be both acute and chronic. Acute forms of the disease are rare, occurring in patients with AIDS and presenting as severe acute respiratory distress. Chronic pulmonary forms are associated with the production of nodules or masses (usually in the upper lobes), cavities, segmental pneumonia, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy. Histologically, these infections appear with inflammation of a gelatinous appearance (88) . This is composed of yeast cells that become granulomatous. Diagnoses can be made directly through visualization of the yeast cells in biopsy samples or from isolation.

In tuberculosis, there is global concern about antibiotic resistance, particularly among those strains known as XDR TB, which are virtually impossible to treat with chemotherapeutic agents. The influenza virus H5N1A is causing widespread concern, because of the potential for a pandemic if a strain develops that can transmit readily between humans. On a more positive note, improved understanding of the genetics and epidemiology of two important bacterial pathogens, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, have resulted in significant advances in prevention, through improved vaccine availability and effectiveness. Respiratory tract infections will continue to be prevalent in all human populations and provide an ongoing challenge for modern medicine.",
