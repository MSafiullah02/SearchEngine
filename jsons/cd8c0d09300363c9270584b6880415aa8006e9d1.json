Intramuscular betamethasone 12 mg once daily for 2 doses was also given due to the potential need for preterm delivery. COVID-19 laboratory values (Table 1) were drawn and were significant for elevated aspartate aminotransferase at 62 IU/L, total creatine phosphokinase at 531 IU/L, c-reactive protein at 14.7 mg/dL and decreased absolute lymphocytes at 0.13 K/uL (0.13 mm 3 ). Upon arrival at the intensive care unit she was intubated for increased work of breathing and profound hypoxia with a partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 75.6 mmHg on arterial blood gas. Her initial ventilator settings ( Table 2 ) were the following: tidal volume at 400 mL, respiratory rate at 16 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cm H2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100%. A discussion with the patient's durable power of attorney designee was completed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f regarding indications for delivery and potential need for emergency cesarean delivery based on both maternal and fetal status. A decision was made to conduct fetal heart rate monitoring 3 times daily for 20 minutes to assess fetal status and allow for delivery in case of significant fetal compromise. The patient had central and arterial lines inserted; of note, the arterial line required replacement multiple times due to thrombosis despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneously daily.
