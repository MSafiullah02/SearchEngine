HFNO, compared with conventional oxygen devices, maintains FiO2 at a constant level, reduces dead space, generates positive pressure that redistributes intra-alveolar fluid, and promotes alveolar recruitment 12 . The next step is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which is administered under spontaneous breathing, so patients require very little sedation, or none at all 13 . The penultimate step is invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). In this case, volume control mode is usually used, and the patient must be intubated 10 .

            "text": "current pandemic of COVID-19 cases requires infection control precautions to be maximised. Nebulizers generate aerosol particles of between 1 and 5 \u03bcm that can carry bacteria and viruses to the lung. The risk of transmitting infection larger particles can stimulate coughing in patients and passers-by, thereby increasing the risk of disease spread. Nebulizer therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection has the potential to transmit potentially viable COVID-19 to susceptible subjects. Some hospitals have recently replaced nebulizers with metered-dose inhalers (MDI) with spacers or valved-holding chambers (VHC). Inhaled therapy shouldpreferably be administered with an MDI with a VHC; however, it is important to note that patients with acute respiratory failure will have difficulties using these devices.Nebulizer therapy should only be used in the following situations:2. Patients that are unable to cooperate or cannot follow the instructions required for an MDI with VHC. 3. Poor responders to MDI + VHC therapy.Despite the large body of evidence showing their lack of superiority, or inferiority, to MDI + VHC, \"open\" nebulizers are still widely used in hospital settings.In order to reduce the risk of in-hospital transmission of infectious respiratory diseases in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we encourage all healthcare professionals to seriously consider avoiding the use of open nebulizers in spontaneously breathing patients if the aforementioned inhalers are not available. Patient and staff safety must be our top priority.",
