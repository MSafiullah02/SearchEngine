Although we think of rabies as being primarily associated with canines such as dogs and other mammals such as skunks and raccoons, and these animals do serve as important reservoirs for rabies that enter the human population, bats are also an important reservoir. In fact, in the United States over the last few years the majority of human cases of rabies have been bat-associated rabies. In some of these cases of bat rabies in humans, exposure to bats is documented and the bite of infected bats is known to have transmitted the virus, but in other cases there is no known contact with bats, leading to the suggestion that inhaling aspirated droplets containing rabies may be the cause of the infection.",

This has resulted in campaigns to indiscriminately slaughter bats using a variety of methods, including poison and the destruction of roosts and caves with explosives. Although these campaigns have resulted in enormous numbers of bats being killed, these campaigns have had no effect on the spread of rabies. Thus, reduction of bat numbers is not effective in the control of rabies but does destroy ecologically important animals.",

            "text": "In September of 1994, a number of cases of severe respiratory illness occurred in racehorses near Brisbane, Australia. The first horse to become ill was a pregnant mare that was pastured in a field, which was then moved into a stable with 23 other thoroughbreds. The disease spread among the horses in this stable and to an adjoining stable and ultimately 17 horses became ill, of which 13 died. Of the four horses that survived, two were left with mild neurological sequelae. Three other horses were infected but did not suffer symptoms. Two humans that nursed the horses became ill with a severe respiratory disease, of whom one died of respiratory and kidney failure. Spread of the disease required close contact, and imposition of quarantine measures contained the outbreak. A previously unknown virus was isolated from the sick animals that was found to be a paramyxovirus and it was initially named equine morbillivirus. Sequencing of the genome showed that it was not closely related to the morbilliviruses; however, and the virus was assigned to a new genus called Megamyxovirus because of the large size of the genome. Subsequent studies established that the virus was a bat virus and widespread in flying foxes in eastern Australia. The virus was renamed Hendra virus after the Brisbane suburb where the outbreak occurred and the genus was renamed Henipavirus. Analysis of sera from healthy humans and horses in the area failed to detect the presence of antibody, and analysis of more than 5000 sera from a variety of wild animals trapped in the areas also failed to detect antibody in any animal other than flying foxes. Flying foxes can be readily infected experimentally with the virus but do not suffer illness upon infection.",

Two horses died and the owner of the horses became mildly ill with neurological symptoms from which he appeared to recover. However, in October of 1995 the owner suffered a relapse and died of encephalitis. At this point an investigation showed that Hendra virus was to blame for the illness of the horses and the death of the owner. In January 1999, a fatal case of Hendra infection occurred in a horse near Cairns, Australia, and in 2004 a horse died of Hendra infection in Townsville.

            "text": "A related virus, 83% identical to Hendra virus at the amino acid level, emerged in 1998 that represents a much more serious threat to human health. From September 1998 to April 1999, an outbreak of 258 cases of human encephalitis occurred in Malaysia and Singapore that had a 40% mortality rate. Clinical symptoms included fever, headache, myalgia (muscle aches), drowsiness, and disorientation that sometimes progressed to coma within 48 hours. The disease was associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs with or without neurological symptoms, and humans infected with the disease were pig farmers or others closely associated with pig farming. It was first thought that the outbreak was due to infection by Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (see Chapter 3 on the importance of pigs as amplifying hosts for this virus) and the Malaysian government vaccinated 2.4 million pigs against JE virus. When this did not slow the epidemic, 1.1 million pigs were culled in an attempt to reduce the incidence of disease. In March 1999, with the assistance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus responsible for the epidemic was identified as a Hendra-like virus, a virus related to but distinct from Hendra virus. Retrospective studies suggested that the virus had been responsible for disease in pigs in Malaysia for several years and it seems clear that the human cases were contracted from pigs. There is no evidence for human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. The virus responsible has been called Nipah virus, after the village in Malaysia where the disease first appeared, and it is classified as a second member of the genus Henipavirus (which gets its name from Hendra and Nipah viruses).",

It has been suggested that the outbreak occurred in part because the destruction of the natural habitat of the flying foxes caused by deforestation and consequent food shortage led the bats to forage in nearby orchards located very near piggeries. There, half-eaten fruit or regurgitated fruit that was contaminated with virus-containing saliva from the bats could be eaten by pigs, causing them to become infected.",

No evidence for the intermediate infection of an animal, as occurred in the Malaysian epidemic, has been seen in these epidemics. Furthermore, in the 2004 epidemic evidence was obtained that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred. It is likely that the disease was transmitted directly from bats to humans, possibly by human consumption of partially eaten fruit that was contaminated with bat saliva containing the virus, followed by person-to-person transmission. It is known in Bangladesh, for example, that during the fruiting season young boys climb trees to pick fruit. If this fruit was partially eaten by bats, the fruit could be contaminated with the virus from the bat. The fatality rate in these epidemics was as high as 75%. In nearby India, an epidemic of Nipah occurred in 2001. Flying foxes are widely distributed throughout this area (Fig. 8.1) and Nipah virus has been isolated from them in both Malaysia and Bangladash. The virus has also been isolated from flying foxes in Cambodia although human infection has not been documented to date.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that the SARS virus, a coronavirus, had to adapt to human receptors in order to cause severe illness. Infection by the bat virus or the civet virus appears to cause only mild illness. As stated before, merchants who were infected did not develop illness, and some persons who work with wildlife were found to be seropositive for SARS but suffered no illness. However, several changes are present in the virulent SARS virus isolated from humans. There is a deletion of 29 nucleotides upstream of the start codon for the N protein and there are four amino acid changes in the spike protein. It is believed that the crucial changes are two amino acid changes in the spike protein that allow the virus to bind to the human receptor called ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) 1000-fold more avidly than does the civet strain or the bat strain. This is perhaps the reason why the virus has not to date reappeared in the human population, together with extensive culling of animals in the food markets in China. If occasional human cases occur they are likely to be mild unless the virus has the opportunity to mutate in humans to form the virulent strain of the virus. However, this did happen in 2002 and may happen again in the future. There is need to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments for the virus, as well as to maintain the Chinese food markets in a way that does not encourage the spread of the virus.",

In view of the fact that to become virulent the virus must mutate to bind more strongly to the human form of the ACE2 protein, it is interesting that there is a second receptor for SARS virus, the protein called CD209L or L-SIGN. Why this second receptor cannot compensate for the failure of unmodified SARS to infect humans efficiently is unknown. It may be significant that another human coronavirus, NL63, only recently discovered, also uses ACE2 as its receptor. Other coronaviruses use different receptors, including aminopeptidase N (also called CD13) by the human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritus virus of swine, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, and carcinoembryonic antigens by mouse hepatitis virus.",

The cause was a virus subsequently named Marburg that was present in African green monkeys imported from Uganda whose kidneys were being processed for cell culture production (for use in preparing poliovirus vaccine). Twenty-five laboratory workers were infected and six secondary cases resulted; of these 31 infected people, 7 died. The monkeys in the shipment, which originated in Uganda, also died. Subsequent studies with the virus isolated during the outbreak showed that it caused lethal illness in African green monkeys following experimental infection. There were 3 cases of Marburg in South Africa in 1975 (the source of infection was probably Zimbabwe) with one death, 2 cases in Kenya in 1980 (infection probably in Uganda), 1 case in Kenya in 1987, an outbreak of 149 cases with 123 deaths in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1998\u20132000, and an outbreak of 374 cases with 329 deaths in northern Angola in 2005. The number of cases is surely underreported since many people in remote areas do not seek medical assistance when ill, and counting of new graves in such locations indicates that the death toll is higher than officially reported. The locations of these outbreaks are shown on the map in Fig. 8.3\n. The reported fatality rate in the larger outbreaks was 80\u201390%.",

During this epidemic, the more than 600 cases resulted in 430 deaths and asymptomatic infection appeared to be rare. One case of Ebola occurred in 1977, and in 1979 there were 34 cases with 22 deaths in the Sudan. In this latter epidemic, an index case was brought to the hospital and the virus spread to four people there, who then spread it to their families. After this, Ebola disease in Africa disappeared until 1994. In late 1994, a Swiss ethologist working in the Ivory Coast performed necropsies on chimps. She contracted Ebola but survived, and a new strain of Ebola was isolated from her blood. Then, in May 1995, there was an epidemic in Kikwit, Zaire, that resulted in at least 315 cases with >75% mortality. This was followed by several deaths in western Africa that resulted from consumption of a monkey that had died of Ebola. Then there was a prolonged series of smaller outbreaks in Gabon from 1995 through 1997. In 2000, Ebola appeared in Uganda for the first time and caused an epidemic of more than 425 cases. There have been further outbreaks in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 in various countries including Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sudan. A map showing these various filoviral outbreaks is shown in Fig. 8.3. Three strains or species of African Ebola viruses are now recognized which differ in their virulence. Zaire ebolavirus is the most virulent with a case fatality rate approaching 90%, Sudan ebolavirus is less virulent, and Ivory Coast ebolavirus is the least virulent.",

Significant numbers of Hypsignathus monstrosus (4 of 17 tested), Epomops franqueti (8 of 117), and Myonycteris torquata (4 of 58) were found to have antibodies to Ebola virus, and viral nucleic acid was detected in liver or spleen of other bats of these three species (4 of 21, 5 of 117, and 4 of 41, respectively). No viral RNA was found in any other animal species tested, which included 222 birds and 129 small vertebrates, among others.

Some human epidemics get started when monkeys dying of the disease are butchered for food, but in other epidemics monkeys are not implicated and how the epidemic starts is not known. Again, perhaps consumption of partially eaten fruit is to blame. The recent large die-offs of apes and chimpanzees in some areas together with the increasing frequency of human infection indicates that the virus is spreading more widely. Whether this is due to a new strain of virus that is more easily spread to humans and nonhuman primates, or to the recent introduction of the virus from a source outside the areas now experiencing epidemics, or to human alterations of the environment leading to more contact between humans and nonhuman primates with the bats that carry the virus is not known.",

This epidemic occurred in Reston, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in 1989. The deaths were at first attributed to simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), but investigation by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that both SHFV and Ebola virus were present in the monkeys. Believing that the community was at risk for Ebola, made even the more alarming because the epidemic was occurring in the neighborhood of the central government of the United States, the army team quickly decided to euthanize the monkeys and decontaminate the facility. Follow-up studies showed that four animal handlers at the facility had been infected by the virus but had suffered no illness. Thus the strain of Ebola present in the Reston monkeys, called Reston ebolavirus, seems to be nonpathogenic for humans although it remains pathogenic for monkeys. The story of the Reston incident was recounted in a book called The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. Since this first epidemic of Reston ebolavirus, a new outbreak has occurred in Reston, two outbreaks have occurred in an animal facility in Alice, Texas, and an outbreak took place in Sienna, Italy. All outbreaks occurred in monkeys imported from the Philippines and it seems probable that the virus is native to the Philippines. No serious illness in humans has occurred in any of these outbreaks. Nucleotide sequencing has shown that Reston ebolavirus is closely related to the African ebolaviruses. The reason it is attenuated in humans is still unexplained, and high containment is used for studies of Reston ebolavirus in the laboratory.",

With the end of the mosquito season the epidemic died out, but the virus had become established. Over the next 6 years the virus rapidly spread across the United States and north into Canada as well as south into Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. The march of the virus across the United States is illustrated in Figs. 8.4\nand 8.5\n. The rapid spread of this virus into a new ecological area requiring adaptation to new mosquito vectors as well as new vertebrate hosts is extraordinary. In the process, more than 20,000 Americans became ill from WN virus infection and more than 800 died of neurological complications (Fig. 8.6\n). Figures 8.5 and 8.6 illustrate an interesting and not well understood phenomenon. After the front passes through an area, there are many fewer human cases of disease in the following years. Yet only a minority of humans in any area had been infected and are therefore immune to the virus, and the virus continues to be present.

A second possibility is that the virus arrived in a viremic bird being imported legally or illegally, although there is no evidence for such an event. It seems highly unlikely that a migratory bird that was off course introduced the virus because West Nile first appeared near a major international airport. The favored hypothesis is that the virus arrived in an infected mosquito that came along for the ride in a jet aircraft. Introduction of the virus was almost certainly a singular event.",

Many horses died of WN disease, and a vaccine has now been introduced in order to protect horses. The effect upon bird populations has been particularly dramatic. Crows, jays, and raptors (hawks and owls) are particularly sensitive to the virus. Almost all crows die after infection, for example, and in many parts of the country the crow population crashed with the arrival of the virus, although there are recent signs that the population is at least partially recovering. Many raptors prey upon small rodents and are\nimportant in controlling their numbers, and a crash in their numbers results in an increase in rodent populations. As an example of the sensitivity of some owls to WN virus, there was an outbreak of WN disease in North American owls in a rehabilitation facility in Ontario in 2002, associated with the die-off of corvids in the area. Large owls with a northern breeding range were particularly susceptible. Snowy owls, northern hawk owls, great gray owls, and boreal owls experienced 100% mortality, and northern saw-whet owls experienced 92% mortality.",

It is possible that the interruption of its transmission cycle described above is due to extensive die-off of susceptible species of birds that serve as its major amplifying vectors. If so, the resurgence of the crow population and the populations of other amplifying species could lead to renewed outbreaks similar to those that occurred with the first appearance and spread of the virus. One encouraging finding relating to the potential of the virus to cause future epidemics of disease is the appearance of an attenuated variant of WN virus in Texas in 2003. In a mouse model, this variant is attenuated in neurovirulence. The emergence of WN virus was associated with the appearance in Europe and the Middle East of a more virulent strain of virus, perhaps enabling it to spread more easily. It seems possible that once the virus becomes endemic, attenuated strains may become dominant.",

These birds undergo seasonal migrations over large distances, and episodes of dead and dying migratory birds have been associated with the appearance of the virus in new areas. The virus is continuing to evolve. Unlike most avian influenza viruses, it is highly pathogenic in chickens and many strains are also pathogenic in ducks, both domestic and wild.

If H5N1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person, and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated, it could cause a devastating pandemic. Efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, supported by the U.S. government and other governments. Promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials, and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises. This effort is complicated by the fact that H5N1 influenza, like all influenzas, continues to evolve, and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain. Nevertheless, there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus. As described in Chapter 4, new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried, including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza A strain, but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced. Efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza. Unfortunately, most H5N1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds, antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available. It is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by Chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza, thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses. This effect may be moderating, however, as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine. Inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against H5N1 virus, but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective. Production of these compounds is limiting at present, but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic erupts.",

Forest cycles of dengue have been documented in Africa and Southeast Asia in which the vertebrate reservoir is monkeys and various species of Aedes mosquitoes maintain the virus. Recent sequencing studies have now shown that the sylvatic monkey viruses evolved in monkeys into four serotypes. This evolution from a common ancestor occurred in the African/Southeast Asian region at some time in the distant past. These different dengue viruses then jumped independently into humans to become human dengue viruses. A dendrogram of dengue viruses of monkeys (sylvatic strains) and humans (endemic/epidemic strains) is shown in Fig. 8.7\n. Notice, for example, that the monkey dengue-4 virus groups with human dengue-4 but forms a distinct lineage from that of the other dengue viruses. Similarly, monkey dengue-1 and dengue-2 group with the respective human viruses but form distinct lineages. Sequencing of sylvatic dengue-3 has not yet been done but it will presumably group in the same way. From the extent of the divergence in sequences between the monkey viruses and the human viruses, it is estimated that the jump to humans occurred on the order of 200 years ago for DEN-1, 600 years ago for DEN-4, and 1000 years ago for DEN-2. It is further estimated that the African and Malaysian sylvatic viruses diverged about 800 years ago. Such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty but are probably valid to within a factor of two. Since human dengue virus is an exclusively human virus that is epidemic in nature and induces lifelong immunity, it could not have existed until human populations were large enough to support the continued existence of such a virus. This topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 4 when discussing measles virus, but sufficiently large human populations arose only within the last thousand years or so in the regions in which dengue viruses first arose and flourished.",

The viruses may have caused large epidemics in the Americas, including the United States, in the 1800s and into the early 1900s. However, it is impossible to determine with certainty from descriptions of the disease written at the time whether dengue was the causative agent of these epidemics or whether other viruses that cause similar illnesses might have been responsible. In any event, dengue almost died out in the Americas following World War II because of efforts to control Aedes aegypti, the urban vector of the virus. With the discovery of DDT in the mid 1900s, a serious effort was made in the Americas to eradicate Ae. aegypti from large regions, in order to control viral diseases spread by these mosquitoes, which include not only dengue but also yellow fever and other arboviruses. These efforts succeeded in eliminating the mosquito from large areas of Central and South America, as illustrated in Fig. 8.8A\n. However, in 1970 these efforts were abandoned because of the expense involved and the detrimental effects of DDT on the environment, and by 2000 the mosquito had reestablished itself over most of the region (Fig. 8.8A). The reintroduction of multiple dengue strains into the Americas from foci in Asia after the reestablishment of Ae. aegypti resulted in the outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever associated with huge epidemics of dengue fever (Fig. 8.8B). The history of the increasing infection rate is illustrated in Fig. 8.9\nby data from Brazil. Before 1993, epidemics of dengue were sporadic, occurring every few years and then dying out. After this, however, epidemics have occurred every year and the total number of cases has increased dramatically (notice the difference in scales).",

This DEN-2 strain grows more vigorously than the native American strain, which is not associated with DHF, and led to the DHF epidemic. Then in 1994 the Southeast Asian strain of DEN-3 responsible for the DHF epidemic in Sri Lanka described in Chapter 3 reached the Americas. The result of all these introductions has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in the Americas.

Following a human infection, it may have smoldered in a small number of people but then died out. When the viruses crossed the species barrier and became firmly established in the human population as HIV-1 is not clear. HIV-1 has been isolated from serum collected in 1959 in Zaire and antibodies to HIV have been found in serum collected in 1963 in Burkina Faso, so HIV-1 has been in the human population at least that long. From sequencing studies of the glycoprotein gene and examination of the rate of divergence, one estimate is that the virus might have entered the human population about 70 years ago, although estimates of divergence rates are controversial. Recent changes in human behavior, including more extensive travel by truck, bus, and plane, changes in sexual practices, and the use of injectable drugs, as well as the increase in the human population, could have allowed the virus to reach major population centers and spread more extensively than in the past, becoming epidemic worldwide. The spread of the virus could also have been aided by the appearance of mutants that were more easily transmissible from person to person. The large increase in population during the last century has certainly resulted in more opportunities for the introduction and spread of the virus in humans, and therefore for the selection of such transmissible mutants.",

            "text": "It has been found recently that the multiple introductions of SIV into humans that became HIV-1 and -2 do not represent the only human infections by monkey retroviruses. Studies of bush meat hunters in Cameroon showed that at least six retroviruses have crossed from monkeys into humans who were exposed to fresh bush meat. These include two previously unknown retroviruses, HTLV-3 (PTLV-3) and HTLV-4 (PTLV-4). Thus, infection of humans by simian retroviruses has not been a rare event. A book called The River by Edward Hooper claimed that the HIV epidemic started because an early version of polio vaccine was contaminated by HIV (or its progenitor). No evidence for such contamination exists, and recent analysis of lots of this vaccine that had been stored for 40 years by three different laboratories failed to find any trace of SIV/HIV in the vaccine. Further, given that monkey viruses have repeatedly entered the human population, it is unnecessary to postulate human vaccine activity for the origin of HIV. Rumors based upon this claim, however, have led to suspension of vaccination for polio in some African nations, resulting in a resurgence of poliomyelitis in Africa that has spread to other areas previously free of polio (see Chapter 3).",

            "text": "Hantaviruses are associated with rodents and infect humans through aerosols containing virus from rodent excreta. The first hantavirus to come to medical attention was Hantaan virus which caused more than 3000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in U.S. troops during the Korean War. Since then, many hantaviruses have been identified in both the Old World and in the Americas that cause serious human illness. They are examples of emerging viruses because as the number of humans increases and as they invade more habitat occupied by rodents carrying hantaviruses, the incidence of infection in humans has risen. Very interesting in this regard was the isolation, in May 1993, of a new hantavirus that causes acute respiratory distress in humans that can lead to rapid death, a syndrome now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and originally called acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). The virus was isolated by the CDC in collaboration with local health authorities following an epidemic in the Four Corners area of the southwestern United States that resulted in approximately 25 deaths. The virus is associated with the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus. It is thought that the epidemic may have resulted from an abundance of pine nuts in the area during a good growing year, leading the local people to harvest larger amounts of these than usual and store them in their homes when their normal storage areas became full. With abundant food available, the rodent population exploded and invaded homes to get to the pine nuts, and it is thought that this more intimate contact between humans and rodents may have led to the epidemic. The hantavirus responsible for this epidemic is now called Sin Nombre virus, which is Spanish for \u201cwithout a name.\u201d Early suggestions that it be called Four Corners virus or Muerto Canyon virus (after a geographical feature in the area) drew objections from local residents who did not want this major tourist area identified with a fatal disease. Eventually the CDC simply named it Sin Nombre (there is a small creek in the area called the Sin Nombre River that serves as justification for the choice of name).",

These viruses are associated with other rodents in the order Sigmodontinae and have been given names of local features in order to distinguish them. These include New York, Monongahela, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal viruses, all of which have caused HPS in the United States (see Fig. 4.26). Related viruses are also found in Latin America. In fact, studies have now shown that hantaviruses are present in virtually all states within the United States and into Latin America, and that fatalities due to infection by the virus have occurred in most states. Retrospective studies of stored sera collected from patients who died of ARDS in the past have identified earlier cases of HPS. Thus these viruses are widespread and have caused many fatal cases of human disease over the years.",
