Adequate CMV in obstructive lung disease represents a challenge. High tidal volumes and minute ventilation are required implying high peak pressures, risk of air leaks, and an almost universal use of muscular paralysis [6]. The use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has been described in a few cases [7\u201310] as a rescue intervention to improve severe hypoxemic respiratory failure while CO2 elimination was yet achieved. In this report, we aim to describe the time course of HFOV in RSV proven infection with predominantly hypercapnic respiratory failure as an effective alternative to conventional mechanical respiratory support.",

Four cases were excluded from analysis (two with congenital pulmonary malformation, two with unrepaired congenital cardiac disease). Three infants, transferred after intubation from another unit or hospital were treated with HFOV as first intention. Six infants, intubated in our ICU, were put on HFOV after a median (25\u201375%) period of CMV of 3.5 (1\u201332.5) h. The relevant demographic data, initial lung pattern and clinical course are described in Table 1. All infants attested of lung overexpansion on chest X-ray [12] while none fulfilled the criteria for an ARDS type of RSV infection [11]. Bacterial co-infection was diagnosed in five infants (56%). Before initiating HFOV in the six cases under CMV, mean (SD) pH was 7.27 (0.15) units and PaCO2 72 (22) mmHg with a mean peak inspiratory pressure of 26 (5) cmH2O and a PEEP of 6.5 (1) cmH2O. Changes in ventilatory settings, blood gases, infants own respiratory rates, heart rates and mean arterial pressures, doses of medication given during the various periods of ventilation are summarized in Table 2. No infant was paralyzed. Hemodynamically, two infants were treated with dopamine. One infant had developed a bilateral pneumothorax under CMV which resolved with drainage and HFOV. Five infants were extubated to CPAP, the other to simple supplemental oxygen and all survived.\n\n",

Our report documents that HFOV can be used as an elective alternative to CMV to support spontaneous respiration and improve gas exchanges in infants with predominantly obstructive and hypercapnic respiratory failure from small airway disease. Indeed, despite bacterial co-infection in half of them, either by scoring the chest X-ray [12] or plotting the individual alveolo\u2013arterial oxygen difference against meanaw pressure [11], all infants showed a predominantly overexpanded lung pattern [15].",

It obviates the need for infant ventilator synchrony and allows muscular paralysis to be avoided. PaCO2 can be controlled by adjusting peak to peak pressure while the infant continues actively to contribute to expiration under usual sedation. We consistently observed that the infant\u2019s respiratory rate slowly increased as pressure amplitudes were decreased (see Fig. 1). A bilateral pneumothorax observed under CMV resolved during HFOV and no new air-leak occurred but the number of infants is too small to draw conclusions. Hemodynamically, a few infants did require adrenergic support but renal function was well preserved as suggested by the physiological metabolic compensation of the respiratory acidosis that occurred over time. The mean duration of HFOV was either similar [11, 16] or slightly shorter to that reported in infants with obstructive bronchiolitis using CMV [6, 15] and all patients could be extubated directly to CPAP or supplemental Oxygen.\n",

Such settings seem at first poorly adapted to the ventilation of obstructive lung disease. However, with HFOV, the transmission of pressures and volumes delivered by the ventilator is exquisitely sensitive to the mechanical properties of the respiratory system and the endotracheal tube [19]. Thus, the requirement of high peak to peak pressure can be explained by the dampening that occur through the small endotracheal tube and down the highly resistive airway of these infants, reducing pressure swings and effective tidal volume [19, 20]. A low frequency can thus be advocated to maintain an adequate tidal volume once high amplitude has been set.",

            "text": "The high meanaw pressure required at the airway opening is a hallmark of all cases reported with HFOV in small airway disease [9, 10, 13] and represents the most intriguing setting. It is partly attributed to the pressure drop occurring through the flow dependant resistance of the endotracheal tube which is accentuated when using an I:E of 0.33 generating higher inspiratory than expiratory flows [19]. More importantly, this high meanaw pressure is considered necessary to generate a sufficient pressure to open and stent the collapsed small airway, allowing pressure swings to be transmitted peripherally and alveolar ventilation to resume in obstructed lung units. In this concept termed the \u2018\u2018open airway\u2019\u2019 concept, meanaw pressure becomes a major determinant of CO2 elimination [9, 10, 13, 14]. The optimal pressure required to open the peripheral airway without causing alveolar overdistention and adverse cardiovascular effects must lie in a narrow range. It still requires an experimental set- up to be approximated scientifically [20].",
