Only essential sectors like healthcare have been permitted to operate. Many G20 countries-imposed curfew, mandatory stay-in-home orders and lockdown of cities and countries. Among all these close down scenarios and locked down industries, utility companies and energy distribution sector were operational 24/7 round the clock providing uninterrupted power supply for a comfortable lockdown \"stay in home\". The success of Fighting COVID-19 and shutdowns is highly dependent upon uninterrupted power supply and power consumption by the building residents. This paper reviews the various actions taken by G20 member countries towards electricity consumption while in COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This research work is an analysis of actions taken by governments under their jurisdictions towards building energy consumers. The outcome of this paper are energy policy recommendations that are based on the different governments responses and actions taken towards energy consumption in buildings.",

It has touched the lives of everyone on the planet in one or the other way. Complete cities and countries amid lockdown scenarios have come to a deadlock, the industries and manufacturing sectors have taken a complete halt. The countries and the government bodies that have imposed a complete mandatory \"Stay in house\", which would be successful only if uninterrupted supply of electrical power or energy would be provided to them. Without providing round the clock uninterrupted supply of energy the \"Stay in house\" would fail because residents seek out of homes to satisfy their basic energy needs. The domestic utilities must be continuously kept alive round the clock without switching off. It is a challenging time for the local administration to keep alive; operations and distribution of electricity because the cost of running administration and energy distribution without any revenues.",

It is explicit, that the economic activities of all households have come to an full stop around the world in COVID-19 period. Most of the people are confined to houses and locked down without work leading to loss of income. Additionally, staying in homes in pandemic time has increased the electricity bill. The situation of loss in income and rising electricity bills makes a huge economic and financial burden on households. The wavering or suspension of utility bills by the governments in pandemic times alleviates the financial burden on household. Therefore it is much needed policy plan by the current governments to tackle economically the COVID-19 pandemic situation . The flowchart in Fig 3 explains the pandemic situation in detail.",

These G20 Member countries contribute to 85% of global economic output, 80% of primary electricity consumption and they have 66% of the world's population [1] . Any minor economic or financial imbalance of these G20 countries have a huge impact on the world's economy. This imbalance has the potential to create an economic catastrophe globally. Therefor amid the COVID-19 emergency it is necessary to revisit the government policies and actions towards Energy consumption in buildings. The energy literature for G20 countries is rare [1] . This paper investigates the action taken by G20 countries towards domestic energy consumption while corona virus pandemic outbreak. The enerdata global energy statistics handbook of 2019 reports; for the year 2018 the total domestic electricity consumption was globally was 22968Twh and for G20 countries it was 21056Twh as depicted in Fig 4. One of the motivations for writing this paper is; COVID-19 pandemic being considered as a healthcare emergency is also a Public, Financial and economic emergency globally. Electricity plays a major role in shaping the economy of a country [2] . Although many factors have been found responsible for energy consumption in buildings for residential sector [3] . But, to assess the economic impact, the electricity sector government policies should also be analyzed. This paper analyses the policies taken by administrative governments to address electricity sector in G20 countries.",

It is because without electricity distribution sector none of the healthcare and Military would operate to their full extent in Fighting COVID-19 outbreak. No.2 There should be uninterrupted and reliable supply of electricity to everybody without discriminating residential, commercial, essential and emergency services. No. 3 There should be at least a minimum of 15% discount to all domestic and residential energy users in electricity bills in this time of COVID-19 emergency. This is to negate the extra surge in electricity consumption caused due to lockdowns. This will alleviate the phycological burden of high utility bills in residential sectors and provide financial relief to the locked down residents in buildings. No. 4 The commercial sector that has incurred a loss of business and revenue due to COVID-19 lockdown should be provided a 100% discount in electricity bills for at least a period of lockdown in that specific area. No. 5 To review the economy of the country through industrialization, All new industries and establishments coming up after COVID-19 pandemic period should be provided a free electricity at least for a period of one year so that the business could establish and could help in the review of economy of the country. No.6 All residential and domestic Building energy consumers should be provided with an energy conservation guide by the respective local administration or local utility company or electricity distributor; Guiding how to conserve energy in buildings in the time of lockdown and pandemic outbreak. No.7 Any utility bill payments should not be penalized at least for a period; until the pandemic is existent in the community. No.11 An online and social media energy awareness camping should be conducted frequently to involve, motivate and encourage the lockdown community to participate in conservation of energy in buildings. This is to impart a responsible energy behavioural change among the end users of energy and to make them \"intelligent users of energy\" in their dwelling habitats. ",
