For the purposes of training students and novice researchers, epidemiology instructors from many disciplines are collaborating with simulation researchers to recreate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and to improve our understanding of the efficacies of public health policies (Huang et al, 2005a; Hsieh et al, 2006). However, computational epidemiology researchers and instructors are still addressing individual problems involving movement and contact patterns among millions of people of different ages and with different professions, educational levels, marital/partner statuses, and levels of epidemiological resistance (Boccara and Cheong, 1993; Barrett et al, 2003; Huang et al, 2004, 2005b).",

Public health policies executed by health authorities also directly and indirectly affect epidemic dynamics and spreading situations (Hsieh et al, 2005). Furthermore, improper implementation and the inappropriate timing of public health policy activation occasionally produces such secondary impacts as disease concealment and social discrimination against infected patients and the health care employees who work with them (Huang et al, 2004). In spite of these factors, most students and novice researchers in public health and related disciplines still use questionnaires or field investigation techniques when studying epidemic outbreaks\u2014a process that prevents many from gaining a macro view of epidemic dynamics or from assessing the potential efficacies of public health policies for prevention and control.",

In previous studies we have applied our social network simulation experiences to the transmission dynamics of HIV, SARS, and influenza in Taiwan (Huang et al, 2004, 2005b; Hsieh et al, 2005, 2006; Sumodhee et al, 2005). In this paper we will explain our proposal for a four-category framework based on demographic and geographic properties, discuss ways of applying network-based simulation approaches to undergraduate students and novice researchers, and describe our experiences simulating the transmission dynamics of two infectious disease scenarios in Taiwan (HIV and influenza). In doing so, we hope to clearly illustrate existing challenges to building network-based epidemic simulations. We hope that our pre-analysis framework and two application examples will assist epidemiology students and novice researchers in their efforts to predict the transmission dynamics of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as to improve current public health policies and immunization strategies.",

Constructivists believe that learners draw upon prior knowledge when forming new schema via discovery learning (Bruner and Lufburrow, 1963). When confronted with a new stimulus, learners apply their own knowledge bases to accommodate new information and to alter their existing schema (Piaget, 1978). When constructive learning processes are embedded in epidemic simulations, students can learn by doing, have more and better opportunities for discovering interesting primary and secondary epidemic issues, and gain hands-on experience for dealing with real-world public health issues.",

Originally developed for medical education in the early 1970s, problem-based learning is now considered a core teaching model in over 60 medical schools (Savery and Duffy, 1995). The use of simulations for learning and teaching has two characteristics that make it compatible with the theoretical foundations of problem-based learning:Engagement. Students often request epidemic simulations to assist with learning and to gain a sense of engagement with real-world epidemiology problems. This allows for the introduction of related concepts to the learning process. There is no \u2018perfect\u2019 simulation, but simulations can still support meaningful learning experiences as long as scenario limitations are taken into account (Aldrich, 2004).Interaction flexibility. Epidemic simulations can be used with interaction and feedback methods to illustrate how infectious diseases are spread under different conditions and circumstances (Aldrich, 2004). Epidemiology problems are usually complicated and rarely have single \u2018correct\u2019 answers, which encourages learners to repeatedly manipulate parameters. With sufficient practice, learners or novice researchers can learn how to transfer their new knowledge to real-world infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Learning through epidemic simulations has at least three potential benefits:Operational. Epidemiology problems often require examinations of the influences of various public health policies in specific environments. Using the SARS outbreak of 2003 as an example, epidemiologists may want to measure the potential impacts of public health policies, but it is impossible to do so when running real-world experiments. Epidemiology instructors and students can examine the influences of different public health policies in different regions, and execute \u2018what-if\u2019 experiments to study the emerging behaviours of infections when irrelevant health policies are temporarily removed. In short, simulations can be optimized for learning (Bertsche et al, 1996).Observational. Users can take epidemic simulation processes and adjust their scales for observation purposes, slow them down, or speed them up (Sumodhee et al, 2005). Epidemic simulations not only allow novice researchers to practice professional skills without having to invest large amounts of resources, but are also recognized as an efficient approach to reviewing or proving epidemiological concepts. This protects them from having to jump into high-risk situations for learning purposes. In classrooms, post-simulation reports allow teachers to determine which concepts their students have mastered (Levy et al, 1995; Hargrave and Kenton, 2000; Klein et al, 2004).Construction. Epidemic simulations can be used to create or explore environments. Using public health policy assessments as an example, learners can practice predicting developments that might result from different combinations of public health policies. In classrooms, epidemiology instructors can exert relatively precise control over knowledge construction and accumulation (Hargrave and Kenton, 2000).",

Teacher preparation time will vary depending on the required epidemiology background, scenario construction requirements, and instruction needed to help learners formulate problem statements, collect data, run simulations, and create reports.

The social mirror identities that connect the two layers establish CASMIM as a small-world social network and preserve the properties of individuals who interact with their neighbours within two-dimensional geographic spaces.

            "text": "The four properties considered most important for building network-based epidemic simulations are:Time scale. In the case of HIV diffusion via heterosexual intercourse, frequency distributions of sexual behaviours over 1 month or 1 year show power-law distribution features (Schneeberger et al, 2004), but the same is not true when the time scale is reduced to 1 day or 1 week. It is also important to remember that different diseases have different incubation periods (5 days for SARS versus 6 months to 20 years for HIV) and immunization periods.Geographic scale. Care must be taken when selecting this scale. Whereas CASMIM can be applied to simulate SARS outbreaks in modern cities such as Taipei or Singapore, simulating multi-region epidemic dynamics requires additional demographic data. One possible solution is building a separate CASMIM for each city and measuring transportation flow between paired cities. For example, a new form of influenza tends to be expressed as a large-scale epidemic, therefore models for countries that have multiple regions require the consideration of cross-border transportation networks. Building a social network for any modern city with an established mass transportation system must assume a strong and varied mix of human movement, which can affect considerations of inter-regional transportation.Data dependency. Data granularity determines the best method for building a network model. Using homosexual HIV diffusion as an example, a situation in which data are limited to frequency distributions of sexual contact restricts modellers to using abstract von Neumann and Moore neighbourhood concepts (Huang et al, 2005b). However, if movement within a high-risk contact group can be traced, modellers can create simulations capable of predicting further development.Extendability. Due to the diversity of data collected for epidemiology issues, simulations of specific infectious diseases often require modifications to existing network models. For example, the homogeneous mixing hypothesis used in random networks assumes that all members of a group are well-mixed (ie equal probabilities exist for contact between any two members), but data on sexual contact or needle sharing do not support this hypothesis. Therefore, extendibility is a major concern when applying an existing network model to new epidemic simulations.",

Results from a logistic regression produced 17.2, 34.0, and 46.7 odds ratios for sharing heroin diluent, sharing syringes, or sharing both diluent and syringes, respectively.

In contrast, note that our SARS simulation CASMIM incorporated the effect of local spreading, meaning that SARS could still spread to any other location via transmission between local neighbours in the absence of social mirror identities or shortcuts.

Despite these weaknesses, we used our multi-region influenza model to simulate the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza and to assess the efficacy of a vaccine policy and related public health policies under different conditions and in different regions.",

By comparing different policies at this level, public health experts can identify the best public health policy. The second indicator (Equation 2), cost-efficacy, was used to evaluate the prevention effect per unit cost; it was given a positive value to achieve better prevention effects (when the value=0, the policy has no preventive effect). Public health experts can use the same benchmark to make decisions for the best timing of public health policies in response to a novel influenza.\n",

The five public health policies and corresponding objects were (a) give the vaccine to randomly chosen individuals, (b) track and inoculate individuals coming into contact with infected individuals, (c) strongly encourage hand washing and mask-wearing by the general public during the influenza season, (d) enforce home quarantines for infected individuals until they recover and for individuals who have come into contact with them for a minimum of 8 days, and (e) give anti-virus medicine in advance to all individuals. As shown in Table 4, the two best public health policies were giving vaccines to randomly chosen individuals and the use of anti-virus medicines; encouraging hand washing and mask-wearing was the third best. All three policies were more effective when activated as early as possible, with little difference in effect between activating the policies in late October and late November. Our main conclusions derived from the simulation results were (a) hand washing and mask-wearing by the general public during the influenza season is the most cost-effective policy, and (b) using anti-virus medicine in advance is more cost-effective than buying and using a mix of vaccines and anti-virus medicines (Table 4).",

Each participant pair was asked to conduct three instructional experiments.

Layer 1 addresses population contact within the same age group, with Susceptible, Exposed, Infective and Removed (S-E-I-R) statuses used as governing equations to simulate disease transmission. The Susceptible-to-Exposed transmission process begins with the initial transmission of a very small number of pathogens. During the early part of the Exposed stage, pathogens reproduce but remain below a threshold for active transmission to other Susceptible individuals. After a certain period in which individuals move from Exposed to Infective status, the number of pathogens becomes sufficiently large for transmission to other Susceptible hosts. Eventually the host enters the Removed stage in which it achieves a state of immunity or dies.",

This would allow for the testing of social distance measures such as school closures. Layer 2 can be used to evaluate quarantine strategies by changing contact rates among different age groups, Layer 3 can be used to evaluate travel restrictions by changing regional contact rates among cities, and Layer 4 can be used for the same purpose by changing the structure of the commuting network.

We also described two sample cases to discuss applications of network-based epidemic simulations. Our experiences in teaching epidemiological modelling and simulations have allowed us to identify three challenges for instructors: choice of a suitable network model, preparation for instruction-based teaching, and evaluating student understanding. Network-based simulations for solving epidemiology issues require more demographic and geographic data support and larger amounts of initial domain knowledge. In other words, most epidemiology issues require collaborations among computer scientists, sociologists, epidemiologists, and policy decision-makers.",
