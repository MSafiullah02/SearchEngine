One of these is the continuous dengue epidemic in Ecuador and other countries in 2019-2020. This period comprises a further increase in cases and one of the largest dengue outbreaks in the region with nearly 3 million cases, 8416 of them in Ecuador [2, 3] . COVID-19 cases in Ecuador reached 1595 confirmed cases with 36 deaths nationwide (March 27, 2020) [4], while dengue, reached 3549 cases.",

Its climatic characteristics and deficiencies in public services have led to the high endemicepidemic transmission of dengue.

Galapagos has neither ICU rooms nor beds, and Amazonia only 10 and 19, respectively. The Coast, has the fewest number of ICU units and beds (139 rooms and 534 beds), the Sierra with 240 and 1219 respectively. Additionally, we will have a high probability of co-infections of both viruses, with mixing symptoms, which can worsen the epidemiological situation of diagnostic, control and treatment in Latin America, unlike in Europe and the USA and not reported in Asia due to the winter period. These data suggest that the health system on the coast could be simultaneously affected by both epidemics, and the number of seriously ill patients will exceed the availability of units and beds if mitigation measures are not carried out rigorously, and immediately.",

However, most of the febrile dengue cases will overlap in health centres along with cases of COVID-19, sharing clinical features. If we add the possibility of some false positives by rapid dengue tests, the failure to consider COVID-19 due to this result will have serious implications not only for the patient but also for the public health. Hence, the importance of developing rapid and reliable tests for SARS-CoV-2/Dengue in the immediate future. Likewise, the differentiated supply of drugs such as ibuprofen, with different severity-COVID19 in Italy [6] , and aspirin (contraindicated for dengue) will increase the complexity of medical care in the simultaneous epidemics. On April 5, 2020, time of proofs correction, there were 3,646 cases of COVID-19 in Ecuador. ",
