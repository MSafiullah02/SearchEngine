A total of 93, 090 patients with COVID-19 had occurred globally by March 5, 2020 [1] . Accurate and fast diagnosis of the causative SARS-CoV-2 is important to isolate the patients with COVID-19 timely and stop the epidemics, as well as save people's lives. Viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, which has been developed and used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly, remains the standard diagnosis of COVID-19 [2] . While a large number of the \"suspected\" cases with typical clinical COVID-19 features and/or identical specific computed tomography (CT) scan were not diagnosed [3, 4] . Moreover, RT-PCR assay which was time consuming and laborious needed special equipment resulted to limit its usage especially in remote areas. The human antibody response which is crucial for the clearance of the initial virus infection has been widely used to help diagnosis virus infection. Compared to RT-PCR assays, the detection of antibody assays are often faster, less expensive, easy-to-use and accessible to staff without laboratory training. Here, we detected dynamics characteristics and magnitude of antibody response in patients with COVID-19, and evaluated serodiagnostic value of ELISA-based IgM, IgG tests for COVID-19 pneumonia. The sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for detection of IgM and IgG were presented and the clinical application of these antibody assays for serodiagnosis of COVID-19 was discussed.",

Diagnostic value of serological test was evaluated in patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. Depending on patients whose disease course (>=13 days from the disease onset), specificity and positive predictive value of IgM antibody were very high up to 100%, which indicated that the IgM can be used as a good mark for diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the sensitivity, negative predictive value and consistency rate of IgM were 73.2%, 80.0% and 88.1%, respectively, indicating that acute infection may still be missed based on seronegative IgM. The specificity negative predictive value and consistency rate of IgG were 95.0%, 94.8% and 88.9%, respectively. That means patients can be diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia base on seropositive IgG. Both seropositive antibodies demonstrate outstanding specificity and PPV, it suggest that seropositve IgM and/or IgG can help to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in patients with a long course. To avoid misdiagnosis, patients with early seronegative antibodies should be retested after 10 days of onset. The data acquired from patients with suspected diagnosis demonstrate that the serological tests are reliable as they show high specifity, of which IgM tests were up to 100% and IgG tests were 95.0%. Those testing results were in accordance with physician's judgments of the symptoms. There were 3 controls out of 60 were positive in IgG tests. These 3 controls (one was weak positive) were healthcare providers, they didn't serve patients who diagnosed as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at that time.

The specific circulating antibody can be uniformly detected, therefore avoiding false-negative results due to sampling or potential absence of viruses in the respiratory system. As an emerging infection disease, the current population is generally susceptible to it and the background levels of serum specific antibodies are low. Therefore, COVID-19 pneumonia can be diagnosed base on seropositive of specific antibodies as an alterative to viral nucleic acid detection with clear advantages. ",

For patients with suspected COVID-19, diagnostic power of serological antibodies was as follows: the specificities, sensitivity PPV, NPV and consistency rate of IgM is 87.5% (21/24), 100% (60/60), 100% [21/(21+0)] , 95.2% [60/(3+60)], and 96.4% [(21+60)/(21+3+0+60)], while those of IgG is 70.8% (17/24), 96.6% (57/60), 85.0% [17/(17+3)] 89.1% [57/(7+57)], and 88.1% [(17+57)/(17+7+3+57)] respectively. 11 DISCUSSION COVID-19 pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December, 2019, followed by an outbreak across Hubei Province and other parts of China [5, 6]. An accurate, rapid and cost-effective laboratory etiologicmethod was urgently needed for the diagnosis of the disease. Serological test is anticipated to work as a compliment approach for diagnosis. Data from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic show that serological responses, including viral-specific IgM and IgG, are valid for serologic diagnosis [7, 8]. Our study characterized the dynamics of serum IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as evaluated the diagnostics potential about this serological test. The results showed that IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the middle and later stage of the disease and ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests for serodiagnosis of COVID-19 have great specificity for diagnosis of COVID-19.",
