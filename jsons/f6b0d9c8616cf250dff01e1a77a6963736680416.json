Consistent with our study, RSV is observed more frequently in winter months in many studies from different regions. 14 RSV and HMPV were usually seen in children under five years of age as the cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In our study, the age relation was significant for RSV and HMPV which were detected in 89% (260 of 292) and 81% (84 of 104) of children under 5 years, respectively.

Coinfections with rhinovirus or RSV were seen in almost half of the samples. These infections were detected in almost all months except June and August. It was reported that coronavirus infections peaked mainly in winter without any significant difference between the four subtypes in terms of seasonality and origin (community or hospital-acquired) of the infection. 28, 29 Bordetella spp is an agent that can be mistaken as viral infection since can lead to prolonged cough and severe infections in infants, and young children. There were only 28 patients with Bordetella infections in our study which were seen in patients less than 3-months old, except for one. Although can be seen at any age, pertussis is more frequent and cause more severe disease in children younger than 3-months-old because of lack of primary vaccination. 30 High vaccine coverage (at least 95%) is necessary to protect children against vaccine-preventable diseases with the herd immunity.

The prevalence decreased significantly at the \u2265 5 years of age (P < 0.05). The most common viruses detected in coinfections were RV/EV and RSV. Clinical importance of the viral coinfections is not clear as several studies detected no effect on the severity of the disease.32,33 The main limitation of this study is its retrospective design. It was not possible to evaluate the effect of multiplex PCR assay on patient management since the clinical data were limited. However, the increasing number of test orders over the years suggests that test results were supportive of the clinical decisions. Also, the 8-yearlong study period allowed a better assessment of the factors affecting respiratory virus prevalence such as age and season. Some of the agents such as bocavirus, HCoV, PIV-4, and Bordetella spp. could only be detected by one of the two tests used during the study, therefore, evaluated only for the years related commercial kit was used.In conclusion, the RV/EV group, namely rhinovirus, was the most common virus for all age groups during the study period. The second commonly detected virus was RSV for children younger than 2 years of age, influenza A/B for children older than 5 years of age. Theseasonal cycle of influenza virus is well known. The same relation was also seen for RSV and metapneumovirus. Virological diagnosis of the pathogen was important since these three viruses caused infections in the same season. Surveillance and monitoring of the annual/ seasonal characteristics of the respiratory viruses are critical in predicting and detecting epidemics and pandemics. In this way, it would be possible to diagnose the correct pathogen and prevent inappropriate antimicrobial treatment.F I G U R E 3 A, Distribution of rhinovirus/enterovirus and adenovirus according to the month.
