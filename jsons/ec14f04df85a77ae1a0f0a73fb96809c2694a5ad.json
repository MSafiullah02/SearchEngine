            "text": "Ongoing internationalization processes have resulted in significant changes on the supply side in many fields of the economy and specifically in tourism. Although the scientific discourse is working hard to keep pace with these rapid changes, there is nevertheless a considerable deficit in research on the problems and risks as well as the potential and opportunities associated with intensifying processes of internationalization. This paper focuses on the internationalization process of small and medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) in the Middle East, specifically in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which continues to be a tourist destination for Westerners in spite of major political and other crises. Internationalization of SMTEs is a complex process, and studies that take a more holistic view of this phenomenon are needed. This paper will therefore attempt to investigate the internationalization process in Jordan from a problem-centred perspective and to critically examine and discuss it on the basis of comments made by leading actors in the Jordanian tourism business. The thus gained insights should help to reduce the still existing theoretical deficits in the study of the internationalization process. Particularly, the impact of the Arab Spring on the Jordanian tourism market must be included in a critical assessment.",

            "text": "Ongoing internationalization processes have led to considerable changes on the supply side in tourism, like in other industries. The academic discourse attempts to keep pace with the changes, but nevertheless, a large deficit remains in research on the problems and risks and also the opportunities and potentials for tourism businesses associated with intensified internationalization (Ateljevic and Doorne, 2000) . A great deal of the conventional literature on internationalization still concentrates primarily on the manufacturing sector and cannot be applied directly to the tourism sector. So far, the conspicuous lack of secondary literature and reliable empirical data has tended to limit research in this area (Castellacci, 2008; Carlsson, 2006) . This holds particularly for the Near and Middle East, which continue to be among the most popular destinations for tourists from Western countries and whose tourism businesses are highly affected by the changes occurring in connection with the political events in the region (Daher, 2007) . Nevertheless, despite its increasing international significance as a destination (UNWTO, 2012) , the region is still often neglected by the scientific community. This neglect has intensified since the onset of the Arab Spring, which has led to a noticeable drop in demand (Al-Hamarneh, 2013) . The concrete example for this paper will be the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, where the tourism industry has experienced a strong international expansion in recent years after decades in which domestic tourism played the most important role (Berriane, 1992; Coles and Scherle, 2006; Pillmayer and Scherle, 2012) . Tourism is still a relatively recent phenomenon in Jordan. Only after the signing of the peace treaty with Israel was it possible for a tourism sector that Westerners would consider professional to develop. In particular, Jordan's geostrategic location between various trouble spots such as Israel, Iraq and recently, Syria and its diversified range of outstanding tourist products make it a very interesting research area (Gray, 2002) .",

In this context, internationalization is understood to be a processual phenomenon that is associated with a qualitative increase in issues and challenges facing the relevant actors (Coles et al., 2009) . Going international is usually a complex process for companies, one that develops out of traditional national business activities. Partially driven by the intensification of international competition and changes in demand patterns, partially attracted by the opportunities afforded by converging markets, companies have developed and employed numerous types of international engagement in the past years. These reach from non-contractual connections, such as loose agreements, over contractual ties or licences, to equity participation, such as cross-investments or holdings (Oviatt and McDougall, 2005) .",

Hence, not only supply and demand are internationalized to the greatest possible extent, but the services provided are per se increasingly based on the overcoming of boundaries (here, innovative technologies in transport and communication play an essential role because they cause space and time to shrink). Nevertheless, the academic discourse on strategies for internationalization or market entry is still in its infancy. This paper will introduce the main internationalization theories. It will then present the empirical results of a qualitative study, which should provide insights into the actual internationalization practices of the investigated Jordanian tourism enterprises.",

            "text": "International tourism has attracted more public attention than most other industries. One of the most important reasons for this is that tourism is a leading sector in many economies (McKercher and Lew, 2005; Meethan, 2001) , and the numbers speak for themselves. To mention only one example, the receipts from the tourism industry worldwide are estimated at $US1,030 billion in 2011, compared with $US928 billion in 2010 (+3.9%). International arrivals rose by 4.6% from 940 million in 2010 to 983 million (UNWTO, 2012). However, it would be much too one-sided to reduce the phenomenon of tourism exclusively to economic indicators. As Hall et al. (2005: 3) pointed out: 'At the very beginning of the twenty-first century, tourism as an industry had probably achieved a higher profile in the public consciousness of the developed world than ever before. There has, of course, been a steady growth in the number of tourists over several decades, but the critical reasons were the impacts on international tourism (1) the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, (2) the American-led invasion of Iraq, (3) airline financial failures, and (4) government and traveller responses to the SARS virus. Destinations and tourism-related businesses around the world experienced a profound shift in consumer confidence and travel behaviour. Arguably, these impacts, and their subsequent media reporting, gave the tourism industry an unprecedented high-policy profile as government and governance at all levels wrestled with travel and security issues, and resultant shifts in the economic and employment impacts of tourism'. Irrespective of the complexity of the phenomenon, which has increased considerably with advancing globalization, tourism research in the past tended to devote itself to aspects on the demand side. In comparison, definitely less attention was paid to the supply side, as relevant assessments attest (Fletcher, 2008; Greenley and Matcham, 2007; Moskowitz, 2008; Turunen, 2009) . It is undisputed that in the international scientific community, there is still a considerable deficit in research on internationalization and tourism, when we consider the detailed research on incoming tourism. Debbage and Ioannides (2005: 99) , for instance, point out this fact in their paper 'The Cultural Turn? Toward a More Critical Economic Geography of Tourism': 'The study of tourism has been handicapped by inattention of the supply side, and we long argued that comprehending tourism requires improved understanding of how the tourism production system manipulates and shapes tourist places and destinations'. This paper addresses precisely this deficit. It focuses explicitly on the supply side. The emphasis lies on the internationalization processes of two of the chief actors on the supply side, hotels and incoming agencies, they being fundamental components of the secondary range of tourism products. In contrast to other tourism studies, which dealt with the internationalization processes on the supply side (in particular Lessmeister, 2008; Mosedale, 2007; Scherle, 2006) and whose scientific interest lay exclusively on incoming agencies, this study also included hotels. One main reason for this was that in Jordan, most incoming agencies simultaneously serve as hotel operators so that there is a strong interdependence between the two types of tourism enterprise (Abu Aliqah and Al-Rfou, 2010) . Likewise, in contrast to the just mentioned studies, the focus was not on the internationalization of operations but on the internationalization of markets because the scientific community has devoted relatively little attention to this topic (Freeman and Sandwell, 2008) . A further motive for this approach was related to the aftermath of the so-called Arab Spring, which caused the demand to drop precipitously in many of the most important European source markets (UNWTO, 2012) . This inevitably meant that the Jordanian entrepreneurs had to tap new international source markets in an attempt to at least partially compensate for the drop in demand (Al-Hamarneh, 2013) .",

First, one specific kind of internationalization, namely, foreign direct investment, is not included. The reason for this is that the so-called Investment Promotion Law of the Jordan Investment Board of 1995 Board of (2000 continues to set strict limits to investors' say in affairs and decision-making powers (Jordan Investment Board, 2000) . Second, a great deal of the conventional literature on internationalization still concentrates primarily on the manufacturing sector, and its applicability to a service sector like tourism is limited (Clancy, 1998; Greenley and Matcham, 2007) . In particular, the conspicuous lack of secondary literature and reliable statistics meant that in this research project, a distinctly qualitative approach was applied.",

It is of crucial relevance for both the investigated subject and the design of the research project. For the subjects of the study, i.e. the incoming agencies and hotels, intercultural activities always take place in a situation of overlapping cultures. In the process, they, with their accustomed, culturally imprinted behaviour, mentalities 330 M. Pillmayer and N. Scherle and emotions, meet up with partners who are influenced by a foreign culture. Intercultural activity is always embedded into a triangle of forces composed of the determinants 'cultural differences' (caused by different orientation systems), 'individual differences' (caused by personality traits and life history) and the existing 'intercultural knowledge and experience' (Leclerc and Martin, 2004; Thomas and Hagemann, 1996) . This definitely requires the study subjects to develop intercultural competence, as demonstrated by such papers as those by Coles and Scherle (2006) and Morrison and Teixeira (2004) . Moreover, a researcher must constantly bear in mind that most theoretical approaches are western inspired and can by no means be applied directly to this research area, quite apart from the fact that in this context, a meta-narrative or strand of explanation of internationalization is out of the question.",

A businessman who wants to meet the challenges can less and less afford to pursue a business policy that focuses exclusively on the domestic market. In these circumstances, internationalization is neither an end in itself nor an exodus but rather a constitutive moment in the framework for action of a gradually rising number of companies. Where until well into the 1990s, it was chiefly multinational and transnational concerns that internationalized their activities; today, it is largely undisputed that to a considerable degree, it is small-sized and medium-sized enterprises that are internationalizing, particularly in tourism (Shaw, 2005; Smeral, 1998) . In the process, the most important effect of increasing internationalization, from a company's perspective, namely, the intensification and spatial expansion of competition due to increasingly interconnected markets, puts enormous pressure especially on small and mediumsized tourism enterprises in emerging and developing countries and can, in the worst case, lead to the loss of the company's independence: 'More specifically, the independence of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including hotels and tour operators, is at risk, when compared with the multinationals. While globalization of tourism and hospitality will certainly create jobs and boost investment, many developing countries are facing the prospects of a huge growth in leakage of foreign exchange earnings in a sector that has long prided itself on being the biggest foreign exchange generator. (\u2026) The critical issue that does emerge, however, is the impact of globalization on leakage of foreign exchange and on small and mediumsized enterprises, essentially the family-owned companies facing the same pressures as in Europe and North America. While the total sell-out of a company leaves the owner with no further financial risk, the primary downside is the large outflow of income from tourism'. (Knowles et al., 2004: 12) .",

At least from a post-modern perspective, this fact should not be deplored because we are increasingly abandoning the modern age's universalistic attempts at explanation, those famous meta-narratives, and are utilizing the fruitful heterogeneity of competing paradigms and methods. From a post-modern perspective, the consequences are clear: the chief concern of the post-modern age, to abandon obsolete claims to unity and universality, means that companies that operate internationally must not suppress the plurality and inconsistencies of reality but recognize and utilize them positively. Due to the radical changes in the environmental conditions, the static dichotomy between differentiation and unification, global and local, integration and responsiveness, is overcome through the simultaneity of different strategic orientations in different company divisions, business segments, regions and stages of internationalization. The success of internationally operating companies thus depends less on making a correct decision between supposedly fundamental alternatives but rather on the capacity to simultaneously pursue complementary strategies. This requires companies and employees in equal measure a high tolerance of ambiguity and the capability to think integratively because only thus can they counter the disastrous tendency,",

On the basis of various assumptions, analytical levels and explanatory factors they provide more or less partial approaches to the internalization behaviour of companies, although, especially in the case of classical theories, only few offer the actors clear aids to decision making (Buckley and Casson, 1988; Weiermair and Peters, 1998) .",

For a company, going international is usually a process that develops out of established national activities. To do justice to the complexity of the internationalization process, however, a multidimensional approach should be chosen. Several studies have shown that the activities of small-sized and medium-sized enterprises in international markets have gradually increased in the last years, especially in the service sector (Coviello and Martin, 1999; Freeman and Sandwell, 2008; Greenley and Matcham, 2007) . The driving force behind the increased participation of SMTEs in the world markets is the intensifying competition on the one hand and the rapid development of information and communication technologies on the other. Since the late 1980s, the internationalization of SMTEs has therefore attracted increasing attention in various academic disciplines (Clark and Rajaratnam, 1999; Furrer and Sollberger, 2007; Javalgi et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, many unanswered questions still exist in connection with this phenomenon (Axinn and Matthyssens, 2002) . The fact is that the internationalization of SMTEs is a complex process that requires a holistic perspective if we are to do justice to the phenomenon. In this paper, the following theoretical reference frame, based on Ojala (2008) , was employed. It refers explicitly to three theoretical approaches to be able to better grasp and analyse the complex process of internationalization:",

A company internationalizes by going through different stages. The model postulates that as a company's market expertise increases, it becomes more involved in the market; this again leads to an increase in decisions and again to activities in the market. The focus is on organizational learning processes in which the factor knowledge, i.e. international experience, plays a crucial role. The consequence is that internationalization patterns do not exclusively embody the result of a conscious strategy aimed at optimizing resource allocation, but rather are the result of an incremental adaptation process to environmental changes. A knowledge deficit at the beginning of the internationalization process implies that initially the company must gradually feel its way so that it can increase its involvement over the course of time as it gains experience. It is expected that companies will first internationalize in markets that are characterized by a similar language, culture, political system, level of education, stage of economic development, etc. Once a company has acquired sufficient knowledge to operate internationally it gradually begins to develop more remote markets.",

            "text": "(2) Network model of internationalization (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988 ): the network model of internationalization applies when a company begins to develop relationships to companies that belong to a network in a foreign country. These relationships may have already existed for a long time and only later have been taken advantage of. Relationships between the companies in different countries function as a bridge to new markets (Johanson and Vahlne, 1990 ). In the model, one company depends on the resources of another company that controls these resources. The first company can, however, gain access to these resources by developing new relationships in the aforesaid network (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988) . In this network, companies share interests, which motivate them to develop and cultivate relationships from which they again have a mutual benefit (Johanson and Vahlne, 2003) . Thus, a company can maintain international relationships with many kinds of actors, e.g. business and private customers, agencies, distributors, representatives, suppliers, competitors, non-profit organizations, public administration, etc. (3) International new venture (INV) theory (Oviatt and McDougall, 1994) : the theory is based on the idea that international new ventures, i.e. global start-ups, focus on international markets when they are founded without striving for incremental internationalization or falling back on an already existing network. Such a company attempts, as Oviatt and McDougall (1994: 49) put it, '\u2026to derive significant competitive advantage from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries'. This approach postulates that such companies are per se internationalized from the beginning because of their resource commitments in other markets. 'International from the inception' signifies in this context that from the beginning their founders recognized the potential of international markets and already made decisions pointing in this direction before actually founding the company. Furthermore, they stress that the company does not need to own its resources itself but must be capable of accessing alternative resources in international markets.",

The model of the Helsinki school, which was developed in the late 1970s, attempted to explain the slow internationalization process of multinational companies. Because the development of the Helsinki modellike its predecessor, the Uppsala modelfocussed on large multinational firms, it was criticized strongly, particularly by representatives of the international entrepreneurship (Oviatt and McDougall, 2005) . Especially as SMEs with in-depth knowledge, or rather companies from the service sector, became more and more present in international markets, the model proved to be insufficient. As a result, several studies emerged in which the network model was considered more suitable for discussing the internationalization process (Moen et al., 2003; Ojala, 2009 ). The network model developed by Johanson and Mattsson in the late 1980s shifts the focus to the fact that most companies use various networks to facilitate and boost their international activities. The INV theory of the early 1990s was ultimately postulated by Oviatt and McDougall to explain why the internationalization behaviour of some companies did not follow the traditional theories of internationalization, as for instance, the Helsinki model.",

For this purpose, so-called problem-centred interviews after Witzel (1985) and Witzel and Reiter (2012) were employed. This type of interview is based essentially on three principles. The first principle is the problem focus. This means that the researcher starts from socially relevant issues whose most important aspects he or she has already explored prior to the interview phase, although the interviewee is always free to develop the concept. Where in a narrative interview, the procedure is strictly inductive and not predetermined by the researcher, a problem-centred interview involves a combination of induction and deduction that gives the researcher the option of modifying the theoretical concept. The second principle, the subject focus, is directed against the frequent practice of developing elaborate research methods independent of the subject or applying ones that are 'established procedure' and tacitly implying that they are appropriate for the subject in question. The third principle, the process focus, involves a flexible analysis of the issue at hand, gradually collecting and testing the empirical material. In the process, the nature of the individual elements and the connection between them emerge only slowly as the researchers constantly reflect on their methods. In accordance with the methodological principles of qualitative interviews, the problem-centred interview employs open-ended questions. The starting point is a The Tourism Industry and the Process of Internationalization 333 relatively loosely defined theoretical concept relating to the main issues of the investigation. However, no explicit ex ante hypothesis is formulated so that no system of a priori categories limits the empirically gained knowledge. In this manner, the research process focuses explicitly on the subjects' perspective to gradually develop an adequate understanding of the interviewees' view of the issue. The semi-structured interview guide employed in the interviews was primarily intended as a guide or memory aid for the interviewer and helped to encourage the interviewees to express their views and to differentiate between narrative sequences. In the interview guide, all aspects of the subject were formulated in the form of individual headings with questions relating to each of the aspects. The main purpose of the questions under each heading was to help the interviewer focus on the issue, but they were by no means to be imposed onto the interviewees. The questions in the interview guide referred not only to internationalizationmeaning strictly the outbound perspective of the Jordanian intervieweesbut also included other closely related issues such as 'finance and investment', 'referral marketing and reputation management' and 'innovation under the influence of internationalization'. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and subsequently processed using the software programme MAXQDA.",

It is a question of the relationship between the individual parts of the whole and the whole itself. Understanding is only possible if the whole is understood; the whole can only be understood, however, if the parts are understood. Hence, the circle contains a paradox. A phenomenon that we wish to understand must 'somehow' be understood beforehand. However, if we look more closely, there is always a circular structure in effect even in details, and in the end, this leads to progress and hence actually should be described as a 'spiral'. Several factors are involved in understanding that can affect both the subject and the object. It is always a question of 'meaning' that is already 'expected' and is then verified. With this, researchers are again dealing with a 'circle'. Past understanding and expected meaning both influence understanding. To put it more precisely, they influence each other mutually, and just as past understanding influences understanding, gradually progressing understanding changes the expected meaning (Paterson and Higgs, 2005) .",

CONCLUSION In this paper, the attempt was made to discuss the internationalization process taking place in the tourism industry of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Using various approaches the authors have shown that a single theoretical approach is by no means sufficient to illuminate this rather complex issue. A holistic point of view requires a multidimensional approach if the scientific community is to even begin to comprehend the internationalization process. This is perhaps understandable, especially when dealing with an increasingly complex environment that a single approach is simply inadequate to cover. The selected comments by leading representatives of the Jordanian tourism industry demonstrate that not one single, but rather several, partially overlapping internationalization processes are underway and that they are occurring truly pragmatically, with companies seizing opportunities to operate in an international market where they arise.

No one wants to make a deal with you if they do not meet you personally; that is the first point. The second point, I go through the Internet. There we can develop our product and try to catch some new companies in different markets. Via the Internet I catch ten percent of my market, of my business. The first step is to send an email to introduce the company, show your profile. I send them an e-brochure so they can see what I do, they can see through the e-brochure the quality of services I offer. For sure we do contact dozens of companies but if only one or two of them answer and we come together, this is a big success for me'.",

It is all the more urgent for the companies to develop international markets and to react to specific exigencies, be it by specializing on selected tourism segments, which are always closely connected with innovative products. Only with innovative products will it be possible to gain competitive advantages and remain internationally present, particularly in such a volatile region. In this situation, it would be useful to develop an appropriate process model that comprises the individual determinants of the internationalization processes representing the specific regional component, some of which arise spontaneously and without control. This cannot be done here because of the limited scope of the paper. Nevertheless, it is perhaps a first step in the right direction.",
