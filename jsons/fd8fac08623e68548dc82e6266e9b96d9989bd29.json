The main effects have been detected on: mobility, environment, social media and people flows. While in this first report only mobility, transport and environment are reported. The analysis performed identified a strong reduction of the mobility and transport activities, and in the pollutants. The mobility reduction has been assessed to be quite coherent with respect to what has been described by Google Global mobility report. On the other hand, in this paper a number of additional aspects have been put in evidence providing detailed aspects on mobility and parking that allowed us to better analyze the impact of the reopening on an eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. For the pollutant aspects, a relevant reduction on most of them has been measured and rationales are reported.",

To this end, the Italian govern implemented a number of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPIs), aiming at full lockdown, previously in specific regions and then in the whole country acting on reducing mobility, social interaction on school and university, social distancing, banning social events, closing public events, services and restaurants, etc. In Tuscany, where DISIT Lab with its Snap4City infrastructure and service has the largest amount of data collected from several sources, the lock down has been progressively performed from the 5 th to the 10 th of March. Moreover, the lockdown has been removed the 4 th of May, starting with a progressive reopen of production activities, still leaving close the social events, entertainments, restaurants, etc., some have had to reorganize themselves to provide take-away services instead on their internal services and rooms. Also the research activity restarted, but we as DISIT lab never closed, we remain for the whole duration of the lockdown in smart working modality as we are now, continuously supporting the Snap4City infrastructure and services, and developing according to the large number of research projects we had in place in the period.",

The main effects have been detected on: mobility, environment, social media and people flows, while this report is mainly focussed on mobility, transport and environmental aspects. For these aspects different data collected and deductions can be provided. Therefore, for each of these domains and/or for each kind of data a separate discussion is presented in the following sections. Moreover, the domains and data may not refer to the same area since the Snap4City data and services are covering a large number of cities and regions as described in Figure 1 . For this reason, before presenting the data and the results a short overview of two main facilities of DISIT Lab involved is reported: (1) Snap4City solution and areas, (2) Twitter Vigilance for monitoring social media (which in this cases has not been adopted for the assessment of mobility and environmental aspects) and that will be subjects of a different paper [8] , [9] , [10] .",

See also: https://www.snap4city.org/dashboardSmartCity/view/index.php?iddasboard=MTc5NQ== for public Dashboard with traffic flow reconstruction in real time. The traffic flow reconstruction allows to actually understand which is the effective usage of the city roads without the need to have a dense network of expensive sensors. As regarding the traffic flow, the following Figure 4 shows the impact of the lockdown on the inflow and outflow of vehicles in Florence (which is the point 1 of the above list). The first part of Figure 4 Dashboard reports the trend over H24 for in/out flows of the city and RTZ inflow, compared with the trend of the previous day. In the second part of the dashboard, the trend of daily counting of vehicles entering (inflow) and exiting (outflow) from Florence city and its RTZ inflow, in the last 12 months are reported, and compared with the previous year data (in grey). Please note that the graphs present a weekly periodic trend (see also canyons due to the weekends), and some holes due to mistakes in the sensors network and communications. In more detail, the following graphs report the trends of whole daily counting of vehicles entering (inflow) and exiting (outflow) from Florence in the period of January and May 2020 (in blue), with respect the corresponding values measured on the 2019 on the same dates (in grey). Please note that, the lockdown has been started effectively the 9 th of March (a Monday), while in the first days of April the total flow traffic was reduced to the 18% (53000 with respect to the 284000). On the other hand, the 4 th and 5 th of May (the first and second days of the reopening) the reduction was still of the 52% (148.000 with respect to 284000). It can be similarly stated for the RTZ, where the reduction in the first days of April has been at the 20%, and at the reopen in May of 46%. This reduction does not take into account the movements of people that are going to move by working or biking and neither in the flow internal to the city, a part for the flow into the RTZ. On the other hand, a similar reduction has been also recorded taking into account all the other traffic flow sensors inside the city as in Figure 3 , and along the high-speed road as FiPiLi in Tuscany. Similarly, from Google Global Mobility report [13] , [14] , it can be observed a reduction of mobility (in this case measured from the Google mobile Apps) of the people as reported in Figure 6 . In this case, as reported by Google the reduction has been at the 30% regarding the baseline (so that -70%), at 75% for grocery & pharmacy, at 30% for Parking, at 33% for transit in stations, at 45% for working, while an increment of local residential movements have been recorded with at a 128% with respect to the previous conditions. Comparing the data of Google with respect to those collected from the actual sensors, it appear evident that the data of Google cannot be combined each other since the different trends are only relative reductions or increment with respect to the corresponding baseline that is unknown. So that, the actual reduction of mobility for working in terms of number of people is unknown. On the other hand, the reduction to the 30-25% of mobility in confirmed for baseline, parking and transit stations; which is coherent with more precise values estimated by sensors still in Florence area.",

In [15] , the model proposed puts in connection the increment of traffic with the R factor that should remain below 1 to control the epidemy. In Figure 7 , the Simulation presented in [1] regarding Tuscany for different cases in which a different rate of increment of mobility is supposed. The effective impact of the registered increment of mobility in Florence is very hard to be assessed since the model is supposing that the returning of the mobility would be performed with the same human behaviour of before COVID-19. On the other hand, most of the population has understood to use the NPIs. Moreover, the model presented in [15] does not clarify which amount of mobility they have suppose to have during lockdown. If they have supposed the mobility very close to zero, the model in that sense has been optimistic. This means that the actual forecast of the number deaths with respect to the increment of traffic and mobility is very hard to be produced even with large bounds of confidence.",

NOX is a generic term for the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for air pollution, produced from combustion, namely nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NOx gases are also produced naturally by lightning. Other sources are house heating and industrial plants. \u2022 CO: Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to animals that use hemoglobin as an oxygen carrier (both invertebrate and vertebrate) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. \u2022 CO2: Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a colorless gas with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air. It occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas. The current concentration is about 0.04% (412 ppm) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps, glaciers and seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. CO2 is produced by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by respiration. It is returned to water via the gills of fish and to the air via the lungs of air-breathing land animals, including humans. \u2022 PM10, PM2.5: Particulate Matter measures are expressed in microgram for cube meter of particles of 10/2.5 micrometers or less, PM2.5 are more critical. The size of the particle is a determinant respiratory tract the particle will come to rest when inhaled. Larger particles are generally filtered in the nose, but particulate smaller than about 10 micrometers can settle in the bronchi and cause health problems. The 10-micrometer does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles. The sources can be natural (soil erosion, marine spray, volcanoes, forest fires, pollen dispersion, etc.) or anthropogenic (industries, heating, vehicular traffic and combustion processes in general). The major components of atmospheric particulate matter are sulphate, nitrate, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust and it is estimated that in some urban contexts more than 50% is of secondary origin.",

This view is reported in Figure  11 , in which a Snap4City dashboard is reported. The different trends allow to compare the traffic flow (that has been strongly affected by the lockdown) with respect to the environmental variables such as: PM10, NO2, CO, etc. Among them the most influenced by the lockdown has been the NO2 due to its dependence to the traffic flow, heating and industrial activities. On the other hand, also the other pollutants have been influenced by the reduction of human activities. In order to assess the impact of the lock down on those environmental and air quality indicators a comparison of the average values of the above mentioned pollutant has been estimated to see the percentage of decrement with respect to the normal period, namely comparing February 2020 with respect to April (the central part of the lockdown). The results are reported in Table 2 , from which is it is evident that the reduction of traffic at the 20% described above is one of responsible of the reduction of NO2 at the 39%. On the other hand, the reduction has not been proportional since the probably the heating of the houses have been increased in the same period, so that partially compensating the decrement of traffic and industry, which in Florence are not impacting very much in the city.

It is probably too early to derive conclusions since this report has been written the 6 th of May, only 2 days after the formal reopening. The resulting traffic volume has been repristinated to more than the 50%, which is a +30% with respect to the lockdown situations. For parking, we still have to see an increment of their usage with respect to the lockdown conditions.
