Instead of calculating the leading eigenvalues of the matrix for graphical representation, we computed curvature and torsion of curves as the descriptor to numerically characterize DNA sequences. The new method was tested on three data sets: the coding sequences of \u03b2-globin gene, all of their exons, and 24 coronavirus geneomes from NCBI. The similarities/dissimilarities and phylogenetic tree of these species verify the validity of our method.",

            "text": "Hamori and Ruskin [1] have emerged as a very powerful tool for the visualization and analysis of long DNA sequences. Several authors outlined different 2D graphical representations of DNA sequences based on two dimensional Cartesian coordinates. The original plot of a DNA sequence as a random walk on a 2D grid using the four cardinal directions to represent the four bases was done by Gates [2] , Leong and Morgenthaler [3] , and Nandy [4] . Their method is based on the assignment of the four bases of DNA sequences to the four directions of the (x, y) coordinate system. These 2D graphical representations of DNA sequence provide useful insights into local and global characteristics and the occurrences, variations and repetition of the nucleotides along a sequence that are not easily observed from DNA sequences directly. However, these graphical representations are accompanied with some loss of information because of overlapping and crossing of the curve representing DNA with itself. To eliminate, or at least reduce the degeneracy of the above graphical representations, many high orders and unique graphical representations have been proposed [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The underlying rationale is that if two vectors points in similar direction and the difference in their magnitudes is small, then the two sequences represented by these vectors are similar. In other words, the smaller the Euclidean distance between the end points of two vectors, the more similar are the two sequences represented by these vectors. Table III denotes the similarity matrix of the coding sequences of the \u03b2-globin gene of 11 species. Following the same method, we can also get the similarity matrices of the coding sequences of the each exon of 11 species, which are represented in Tables IV-VI. In Table III , for the coding sequences of the \u03b2globin gene of 11 species, it is obvious that the coding sequences of Gallus is the most dissimilar to the other 10 species, which is consistent with the fact that Gallus is non-mammal, whereas the others are mammal. The more similar species pairs are Human-Gorilla, Human-Chimpanzee, Rat-Mouse, and Gorilla-Chimpanzee, which are consistent with the results obtained by Randic [5, 19] and B. Liao [20] . In Tables IV-VI, for the single exon of the coding sequences of the \u03b2-globin gene of 11 species, there are some flaws. Some entries are not better than that of Table III. To compare with other methods, we use the leading eigenvalues of E, L/L, M/M matrices [7] to perform the similarity analysis on the same data. The similarity for any pair of DNA sequences can be Table VII . Table VII shows that our results are better than E, L/L, and M/M matrix. For example, Human is more similar to Chimpanzee and Gorilla in our method. But in E, L/L, and M/M matrix, Human is more similar to Lemur, which does not accord with the results reported in the references [5, 19, 20] .",
