Established in 1971, HSCRC has broad responsibility to disclose publicly hospital data in order to promote, among other factors, cost containment, access to care, and equity. Hospitals submit data to the HSCRC on a quarterly basis. The dataset contains discharge medical record abstract and billing data on each of the state\u2019s approximately 800 000 inpatient admissions annually. Maryland Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals are not under state regulation; therefore, HSCRC data from those hospitals were not available. The Maryland acute-care hospitals consisted of diverse academic and teaching institutions as well as private and public medical care centers. Admission capacity ranged from 9 to 1000 floor beds and from zero to 266 adult ICU beds [21].",

A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the RRs and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the 3 individual types of RSV, flu, and c-RSV\u2013flu outbreak periods to n-RSV\u2013n-flu periods. The RRs were calculated by exponentiating estimated regression coefficients based on the Poisson regression model. In addition to the 3 outbreak period indicators, the regression model included hospital admission year and month to account for study seasonal variability that likely involved a mixture of factors. These factors may have included other respiratory viruses or bacteria as well as seasonal or environmental conditions that could have influenced the outcome results of interest.
