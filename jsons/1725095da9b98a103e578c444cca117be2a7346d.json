The vast majority of documented superspreading events occurred in hospitals, with few exceptions (e.g., the Amoy Gardens [4] ), but the underlying causes of such events have not been well studied. The World Health Organization [5] attributed the superspreading phenomenon to the lack of stringent infection-control measures in hospitals during the early days of the epidemic. Shen et al. [6] identified 4 superspreading events in Beijing and found that the index patients were likely to have been older and had a higher case-fatality rate and a larger number of close contacts.

In our recent study of airflow around oxygen masks during oxygen therapy, exhaled air from the mask can travel up to 0.4 m on each side of the patient [29] . In the present study, both the use of oxygen therapy and BIPAP ventilation imposed a significant risk for nosocomial spread of SARS in the final combined model (cutoff value, 3 cases), and use of oxygen therapy also significantly increased the risk in models with higher cutoff values. We did not have enough details about oxygen therapy modalities given to the index patients to allow a more refined analysis regarding the types of masks or cannulae and flow rate of oxygen supply in this study. Proper capturing (enclosure, containment, and local exhaust) and filtering (high-efficiency particulate air filter) of exhaled or expelled air should be imple- mented if oxygen and BIPAP ventilation must be used for clinical reasons. The mechanical maneuvers and procedures associated with resuscitation can generate large amounts of aerosols that are potentially infectious, especially during intubation of the airway and manual ventilation.

However, there are several limitations in this study. Because the study was confined to 2 cities in southern China, we are not sure if our results could be applied to other countries with different hospital practices. Nonetheless, we believe that our study has provided the best available evidence thus far on risk factors for superspreading events in the hospital setting. Another limitation might be that the interviews were conducted 11 year after the occurrence of the outbreaks of SARS, and recall inaccuracies might exist. However, we performed site inspections and physical measurements to obtain information on various physical and en-vironmental risk factors and reviewed documents and staff rosters to complement and supplement recall and reporting by the ward managers. Therefore, information bias should have been substantially reduced. On the other hand, all host factors were abstracted from review of original medical records and should be objective. Another intrinsic weakness of the current study was the lack of statistical power because of the small number of case wards, especially in the subgroup analysis for Hong Kong. Thus, the contribution of certain possible risk factors (such as type of ventilation in the ward and lack of appropriate personal protective equipment and infection control training) could not be entirely ruled out. Certain factors that are intuitively important (e.g., presence of patient isolation or segregation and performance of mechanical ventilation or intubation among index or initial patients) unexpectedly did not have notable effects on univariate analyses. The true effects of these factors might have been subsumed by closely related risk factors that were statistically significant, such as resuscitation having been performed. The small number of study units prevents us from including these factors in multiple regression analyses that could have identified their independent effects. Perhaps a larger international collaboration would help solve this problem. All in all, the fairly consistent results of different subgroup analyses in Hong Kong and Guangzhou provide indirect support that our results are generally valid. Environmental or administrative factors were more important than host factors. Other than the presence of systemic symptoms (in analyses with more restrictive definitions for a superspreading event), the 2 host factors identified-use of oxygen therapy and use of BIPAP ventilation-pertained more to environmental contamination than to individual patient characteristics.

Nevertheless, the lessons learned from this study remain very important and highly relevant to the daily operation of hospital wards if we wish to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory infections in the future. With the current threat of avian influenza and other respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis, hospital wards have to be redesigned and managed in a manner to ensure that environmental factors associated with nosocomial infections are kept to the minimum. The importance of adequate spacing between beds and provision of washing or changing facilities for staff cannot be overemphasized. Staff with symptoms of respiratory infections should refrain from continuing their clinical duties. Adequate complementary protective devices at the source of infection (namely, infected patients) would have to be designed.
