However, 15\u201320% of mumps infections can be asymptomatic and 50% are associated with non-specific or respiratory symptoms.15 In February 2007, mumps re-emerged in university students in Nova Scotia. During the height of the outbreak (February to July, 2007), our laboratory performed over 3410 PCR tests for mumps virus on approximately 2082 patients.6 Of these, 298 positive PCR results were obtained, yielding a positivity rate of 14.3% (298/2082).6 The low positivity rate highlights the difficulty with diagnosing mumps infection based solely on clinical presentation. However, the possibility that infection with other circulating viruses could mimic mumps has yet to be explored.",

Although other viral pathogens were circulating during the mumps outbreak, we failed to show any correlation between parotitis and viral pathogens that could mimic the clinical presentation of mumps infection. The most likely explanation for the low positivity rate may simply be the result of increased Public Health messaging which in the UK has lead to increased rates of reporting by front line clinicians.13 In addition, because the majority of the patients in the Nova Scotia outbreak had one dose of a mumps containing vaccine, this partial immunity likely modified the clinical presentation of mumps infection including minimally enlarged salivary glands and lower viral shedding making laboratory confirmation difficult. While we cannot conclusively say that physicians were inexperienced as we have not directly surveyed them regarding their experiences, the very low prevalence of disease in the decade preceding this outbreak suggests that many physicians would not have seen a case of mumps in their careers. This possible inexperience in combination with possible atypical presentations and increased public health messaging, led to increased specimen submission on patients with non-specific symptoms. This reflects the difficulty in diagnosing mumps in a partially immunized population, a challenge faced by front line clinicians during this outbreak.",
