Other vaccine candidates include vector-based DNA vaccines [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], a combination of whole killed virus and DNA vaccines [12], inactivated whole virus vaccines [13], [14], a combination of DNA and S-peptide vaccines [15], and other recombinant proteins and their fragments.",

Briefly, the cDNA was cloned in two steps due to the size of the gene (\u223c3.5 kb). The 5\u2032 one-third of the ORF (Front), containing the N-terminus, was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector pPSC12 (Protein Sciences Corporation, PSC), downstream from the baculovirus very late promoter of the polyhedrin gene. The insert was also in frame with the chitinase secretion signal sequence. The remainder of the gene was cloned into pUC18. Both inserts were sequenced (MWG Biotech) in full to confirm presence of entire gene. Two fragments of the ORF were then joined in pPSC12 using convenient restriction sites to assemble the complete SARS-CoV ORF and the insert and flanking regions of the vector were sequenced.",

This is encouraging since highly purified proteins by themselves may be poorly immunogenic or non-immunogenic [36]. The first pre-clinical study of the \u0394TM S protein vaccine was conducted to address several questions, including safety, immunogenicity, ability to elicit SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody, dose escalation, and comparison with His-tagged full-length S glycoprotein. Immune responses as determined by ELISA were strong, with GMTs as high as 300,000 and plateaued around 200,000 (Fig. 2A). SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody titers averaged around 1:200 (Fig. 3A).
