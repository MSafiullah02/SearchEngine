            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to bat SARS related coronaviruses,1 is the second pandemic of the 21st century following the influenza A H1N1 pandemic of 2009. With the rapidly galloping epidemic due to globalization and international travel, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020,2 which is 72 days after the first official announcement of clusters of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019 (day 1).3 As of 8 April 2020 (day 100), over 1.35 million people have been infected worldwide with nearly 80,000 deaths.4 In response, proactive infection control measures have been implemented in hospital settings.5\n,\n6 In addition, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions including border control or closure, quarantine and testing of all incoming travelers or returnees, massive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for case detection, rapid contact tracing and quarantine, frequent hand hygiene, and later social distancing measures including school closure, home office, cancelation of all mass gatherings, later stay-at-home order, and cessation of all socioeconomic activities except essential services, were also adopted to various degrees and at different time points in different geographical areas to reduce the risk of community transmission. Many of these measures had been used for the control of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (HKSAR) and other parts of the world.7\n,\n8 However, the efficacy of community-wide masking of the population during these past epidemics or the present COVID-19 pandemic has not been clearly investigated. Unlike 2003 SARS which was generally manifested with high fever and progressive pneumonia with a mortality of about 10%, COVID-19 can be associated with very mild symptoms and a mortality of less than 4%. Thus subclinical or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 shedders may play an important role in perpetuating the pandemic.9\n,\n10 We hypothesized that community-wide masking in HKSAR may break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the infectiousness of the subclinical virus shedders while also offering some protection to the susceptible population.",

As an objective parameter of community-wide preparedness, compliance of face mask usage by the general public monitored by staff working in Infection Control Unit, and Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital for three consecutive days from 6 April to 8 April 2020 (day 98 to day 100).

This public action was linked to the painful experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak (1755 cases with 299 deaths in 6.73 million population) when HKSAR people adopted universal masking in addition to other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand hygiene, social distancing and school closure.7 These community hygienic measures during the SARS outbreak resulted in a significant reduction of positive specimens of all circulating respiratory viruses including influenza viruses in 2003 compared with preceding periods.14 In a case-control study conducted in Beijing during 2003 SARS, consistent wearing of a face mask outdoors was associated with a 70% risk reduction, compared to those not wearing a face mask.15\n",

In effect, these mask-off settings allowed the sharing of their saliva and respiratory droplets, which may contain a viral load of 100 million per ml, directly or indirectly.16\n,\n17 In HKSAR hospitals, wearing face masks is mandatory during the pandemic. It is also the practice among many community service providers and those who are working indoors. Since the supply of face mask was tight in the community as well as in the healthcare setting, it is the practice of our general public not to use more than one face mask per person per day. We observed that the overall compliance of face mask usage was 97% in all administrative districts in the morning. Thus we have the reason to believe that their compliance to face mask usage would remain high throughout the day at the workplace. It is therefore not surprising that the number of COVID-19 clusters was significantly higher in the mask-off recreational settings in HKSAR.",

In particular, our incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of Singapore, a city comparable with HKSAR in terms of area, population density, healthcare infrastructure, BCG vaccination,19 as well as adopting social distancing strategies and SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure.20 Besides a lower ambient temperature and a higher risk of importation of COVID-19 cases from the mainland which are factors promoting COVID-19 transmission in HKSAR, the most important difference between the two cities is the community-wide usage of face masks in HKSAR but not in Singapore. Moreover, 50% of local transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea was attributed to religious activities where face mask usage was discouraged.

Despite some supporters of WHO recommendation speaking against universal masking in our local medical community, most opinion leaders in the clinical microbiology and infectious disease specialties of HKSAR openly championed this measure for the control of community transmission of COVID-19.28 Masking is a continuous form of protection to stop the spreading of saliva and respiratory droplets to others or from others, and to the environment or from the environment to the susceptible by hands through touching of nose, mouth and eye. Touching nose and mouth is a subconscious behavior.29 Hand hygiene is always the cornerstone to prevent transmission of COVID-19 but it is a one-off discontinuous process where hand contamination may occur easily between each alcoholic handrubbing or hand washing. Although we have successfully implemented directly observed hand hygiene (DOHH) by regular delivery of alcohol-based hand rub to conscious hospitalized patients and persons in residential care homes for the elderly before meal and medication rounds,30, 31, 32 it may be difficult to practice DOHH in the community. Studies have also shown that wearing a mask with frequent hand hygiene significantly reduced transmission of seasonal influenza virus in the community setting. But once the effect of the use of surgical mask was removed, the effect of hand hygiene became insignificant.33 With the understanding that the supply of face masks should primarily be reserved for usage in healthcare settings, we believe that it is still advisable to encourage people to wear face masks in the public based on the precautionary principles.34 Moreover, wearing a cloth mask with less filtration efficiency may still be better than no mask at all in communities of high transmission.",

            "text": "There are several limitations in our study. First, we did not analyze the mask-off settings in the family because the modes of transmission among close household contacts can be more diverse. If the 15 family clusters were also counted within the mask-off settings, the difference would be even more significant (p<0.001). Second, the type of mask used in the community cannot be controlled. The compliance of wearing face mask in terms of not touching the external surface of mask or face, and hand hygiene before or after touching the mask cannot be assessed. Third, we cannot count the mask compliance directly for every community settings. Nevertheless, in the absence of effective antiviral and vaccines, the pandemic spread COVID-19 to many countries provide an unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of this non-pharmaceutical control measures. As of 27 February 2020 (day 38 since the first reported case in South Korea), South Korea government has started to distribute face masks to the public amid the outbreak of the COVID-19,36 which was associated with a flattening of the epidemic curve. As of 14 April 2020 (day 82 since the first reported case in Singapore), Singapore government has started to enforce a penalty of 300 Singapore dollar for anyone going out from home without a mask.37 Further studies on this important non-pharmaceutical control measure are warranted. In order to live with emerging infectious diseases and seasonal influenza epidemics, every individual should have personalized reusable mask, gown, and gloves made of self-disinfecting fabrics, and even reusable anti-fog face shield within their own set of Epidemic Combat Kit for their personal protection.",
