There is growing public discontent with national governments implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies, as we witness the wildfires from California to Australia, from Siberia to the Amazon and the floods in Mozambique and other countries. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is undeniably related to the climate crisis. We have known for some time that global warming is increasing the likelihood, the timing, the intensity and geography of zoonoses, epidemics and other public health threats via a web of intertwined causal pathways [6] . Factors such as globalization, population density, latitude, human behaviour, cultural habits, prosperity, land use, migration or conflict contribute to the prevalence and incidence of these infectious diseases that affect human health, animal health and environmental health. There is still much unknown or is 'known unknown'.",

These effects have presented themselves faster and more dramatically than expected, with most impact on the vulnerable and most disadvantaged people. This has resulted in increased mortality and incidence of climate-related zoonoses, heat stress, more asthma and allergies, with resultant loss of labour productivity. For the near future, we can anticipate increased cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as mental ill health, besides the health consequences of food insecurity, water shortage, climate migration or territorial conflict.",

In addition, the healthcare industry must examine its own carbon footprint, as it is in itself contributing to climate change through greenhouse gases emission, waste and pharmaceutical pollution. Climate change and its impact is the new public health challenge and has become a major determinant of health. The prevailing paradigm of medicine is challenged by what is called 'the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century' [10]. The global COVID-19 outbreak is only one example of this. Firstly, we must combat this crisis. Now it is time for health professionals to act decisively and collaborate for a transition in order to prevent its causes. Since climate change also presents 'the greatest global opportunity of the 21st century' this transition entails an opening for hopeful, innovative and positive action as well [11] .",

This marked a historical and unique opportunity for the International Society to recognize the relationship between climate change, health and health care quality and act accordingly. Climate change can only be moderated by a series of global measures, the first of which is shifting away from global fossil-fuel dependency in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The healthcare sector could contribute substantially to this goal since its contribution to global carbon dioxide emission is estimated to be the equivalent of 514 coal plants; 4.4% of the global net emission [13] .
