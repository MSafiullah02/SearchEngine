He made the control of the MERS outbreak a top priority in the country's health agenda. An advisory council was set up to urgently develop scientific evidence-based plans to control the MERS outbreak and prevent human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission; an appropriate management algorithm, including best-practice guidelines for accurate diagnosis, infection control, intensive care, emergency medicine, and treatment; prioritise research related to the MERS-CoV outbreak such as case-control and cohort studies, seroprevalence studies, and clinical trials; and to effectively monitor outbreak control activities.",

The MOH enforced strict infection prevention and control measures in health-care facilities including King Fahd General Hospital, Jeddah, where substantial health-care\u2013associated transmission of MERS-CoV between patients and staff happened, mainly due to overcrowding of patients by about four to five times its maximum capacity in the emergency room. Overflow patients in the emergency room were relocated to other hospitals in Jeddah to reduce the risk of further transmission of the virus. Intensive education and training of staff about essential infection control measures were done to abort transmission of MERS-CoV in health-care settings. The MOH has also invited experts from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess the outbreak. The advisory council, in collaboration with the CDC, has initiated case-control studies to identify risk factors for acquisition of MERS-CoV infection in primary and secondary cases.",

The new case definition added a fourth category for contacts of people with MERS-CoV who present with not only lower respiratory tract but also isolated upper respiratory tract features. This definition classified the status of patients into three categories of suspect, probable, or confirmed infection. The new MERS-CoV case definition was revised and approved by the advisory council after seeking external CDC expert opinion.",
