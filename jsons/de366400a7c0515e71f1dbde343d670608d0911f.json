Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore the clinical features and factors influencing prognosis of COVID-19 patients. However, studies on cases with severe COVID-19 are few at present. This study enrolled COVID-19 patients, including 47 non-survivors and 26 survivors, admitted to the ICU. According to our results, older patients with concurrent chronic diseases have an increased mortality risk, which was consistent with the results of Chen et al. (2020) . The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not clear at present, and it might be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory factor storm. We collected the laboratory results of patients on admission and found that 29 (61.7%) patients in the non-survivor group had elevated IL-6 levels on admission, suggesting the presence of severe inflammatory response in these patients. Some studies reported that the risk of respiratory failure in patients with IL-6 level >80 pg/ml increases 22-folds compared with the patients with low IL-6 levels(T. Herold,2020) . Actemra, an IL-6 antagonist, is verified to block the inflammatory factor cascade to prevent the progression to severe and critical conditions and to reduce the mortality risk. Similarly, there was also a marked difference in the CRP level between non-survivors and survivors, suggesting that severe inflammatory response might be one of the causes of death.",

Our study discovered that the level of hs-TnI increased in many patients on admission, indicating that cardiac injury occurred in the early stage of the disease.The incidence rate of cardiac injury among patients at admission was 16.44%, with the non-survivors having an incidence rate of as high as 25.53%. In addition, no obvious liver or kidney dysfunction was detected, revealing that severe COVID-19 patients might develop cardiac injury at the early stage of the disease, and that the heart might be the first affected extrapulmonary organ. Moreover, we found that the incidence rate of cardiac injury increased with increasing age. Further analysis revealed that the elevated hs-TnI levels was closely correlated with the prognosis andmortality risk of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the mortality risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by 1 unit. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had a shorter duration from symptom onset to ICU admission for further rescue interventions and shorter overall course of disease. At present, the mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Both, the novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS virus in 2003 belong to the \u03b2 coronavirus, and ACE2 has been verified as the common pathogenic target. ACE2 is extensively expressed in myocardial cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and coronary artery endothelial cells; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may act on ACE2 to induce myocardial damage. Furthermore, the recently published autopsy results of COVID-19 patients demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the myocardial interstitium (Tavazzi G et al.2020) . Shi et al.(2020) discovered J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 that COVID-19 patients with concurrent myocardial damage had markedly elevated inflammatory index levels, and myocardial damage was considered to be related to the inflammatory response. Zheng et al.(2020) found that the D-dimer level of >0.5 \u00b5g/L was associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, and the possible mechanism could be increased production of pro-inflammatory factors in COVID-19 patients, which aggravated the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and resulted in plaque rupture caused by local inflammation, pro-coagulant factors ,and hemodynamic changes, thereby inducing thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Our data showed that the elevated troponin level was related to a poor prognosis, but after adjusting for inflammatory factors and coagulation indexes, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death in the multivariate analysis disappeared, revealing that cardiac injury might be related to the inflammatory response and abnormal coagulation function, which was consistent with previous research results. The abovementioned findings reveal that the heart is the potential target of SARS-CoV-2, which is associated with the severe course of the disease; thus, early monitoring and assessment of cardiac injury should be conducted as soon as possible while paying attention to the pulmonary injury.",
