Similarly, studies on international travelers arriving in Australia in May 2009 [7] and on medical students returning to Spain in June 2009, demonstrated outbreaks among the study group and their contacts [8]. While, these and previous reports documenting seasonal influenza among air travelers [2], [9], [10], [11] have focused primarily on the in-flight transmission of influenza, clearly air travellers are responsible for the introduction of influenza viruses into countries on an ongoing basis [12].",

The use of antiviral trial data where subjects were enrolled with ILI during the influenza season found that fever (temperature \u226537 \u00b0C) and cough when used as predictors during periods of influenza virus prevalence had a PPV of up to 79% in adults [27][27]. In children \u22655 years, fever (temperature \u226538 \u00b0C) and cough resulted in a PPV of 83% [26]. Interestingly, in adults it was found there was little advantage of measuring other symptoms [27].

These symptoms were recorded at a single time point and the stage of the illness after symptom onset of each illness was not recorded.
