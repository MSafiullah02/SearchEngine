            "text": "The non-enveloped small double-stranded circular DNA viruses of the Polyomaviridae are known to infect a wide variety of birds and mammals. Until recently, only two, JC virus (JCV) and BK virus (BKV), were known to commonly infect humans. Both are ubiquitous in the human population (Knowles, 2006), establish persistent infections in the kidneys and in other tissue sites without overt disease (Randhawa et al., 2006), and may be detected in the urine of healthy adults and occasionally in the feces of children (Vanchiere et al., 2005, Knowles, 2006). Both JCV and BKV may cause human disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients. JCV is the causative agent of the neurological disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which occurs primarily in AIDS affected patients (Dubois et al., 1998). BKV-associated disease includes hemorrhagic cystitis and other urinary tract diseases, which most commonly manifest in transplant patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (Bogdanovic et al., 2006). In addition, both JCV and BKV exhibit oncogenic properties in experimental animals. Indeed, in the past few years JCV, BKV and a simian polyomavirus, SV-40, have come under greater scrutiny for their potential roles in several human cancers (Lee and Langhoff, 2006).",

The two viruses are genetically closely related and together form a new subfamily of polyomaviruses; they have comparable genomes in the early coding regions to other primate polyomaviruses, but are dissimilar in their late regions (Gaynor et al., 2007). So far, the role of these novel polyomaviruses in human disease has not been established. Initial data show that both KIV and WUV can be detected in up to 4.5% of respiratory samples obtained from patients with acute respiratory tract infection (Allander et al., 2007, Gaynor et al., 2007, Bialasiewicz et al., 2007). However, a precise role in respiratory disease has been confounded by high co-detection rates with other respiratory viruses. Unlike JCV and BKV, KIV and WUV nucleic acids have not been detected in urine samples, raising further questions over the persistence of these viruses in the human body, as well as modes of transmission.",

The successful development of any PCR assay for microbial detection is dependant on the availability of sufficient sequence information to ensure the assays\u2019 primer and probe targets are both conserved and specific. However, for many organisms, both novel and characterized, the necessary spectrum of sequence data is lacking. This is particularly so for newly described organisms. Therefore, in our opinion, a comprehensive validation of potential PCR assays for the detection of novel micro-organisms in samples from different population groups requires the simultaneous evaluation of multiple targets, in case unknown genetic variants exist.",

Although all of the real-time methods proved to have lower detection limits than the conventional PCR methods, two real-time assays, KI-B and WU-A, demonstrated a reduced clinical sensitivity in specimens (86.7% and 95.5%, respectively) when using the respective conventional assays as the reference. The false-negative results obtained with these assays may have been due to sequence variation in the oligonucleotide targets. In our experience, very few mismatches between primers and/or probes and their respective targets are needed to affect the sensitivity of a PCR assay. It is for these reasons that multiple genetic targets should be examined in initial evaluations, and then the chosen targets should be re-examined at later time periods, particularly when dealing with new viral agents that may exhibit considerable genomic variation. On this basis, we deemed the KI-B and WU-A assays to be unsuitable for use in further research of these viruses.",

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that all of these represent false-positive results by the rtPCR methods, as five of the nine additional KIV positive specimens were positive by both the KI-A and KI-B methods (Table 4). Similarly, four of the nine additional WUV-positive specimens were positive by more than one WUV rtPCR assay. Further, all of the real-time assays target different sequences on the respective KIV and WUV genomes, making simultaneous cross-reactions much less likely.

Standards containing KIV or WUV DNA at a concentration returning a Ct value of 33 or greater in the real-time methods could not be detected by the conventional PCR assay (Table 5). Sensitivity issues are commonly encountered when evaluating rtPCR methods, as the assay under evaluation is often more sensitive than the reference method. Approaches such as discrepant analysis are often used to circumvent these problems. However, we refrained from using discrepant analysis on these specimens, given this approach has previously been criticised for introducing bias when used to recalculate sensitivity and specificity values (Hadgu, 2000).",
