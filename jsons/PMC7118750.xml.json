A 25-item self-administered questionnaire was developed with the aim of examining different aspects of FRC operational arrangements and staff attributes. The questionnaire consisted of items in the form of Likert-scale, multiple-choice questions and a limited number of open-ended questions. The questionnaire included questions on demographic attributes, experience of working arrangements, training received in the FRC, Fluzone (a case-management tool designed for FRCs to collect detailed epidemiological data using standardized algorithms),3 sources of information on influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (or \u2018swine flu\u2019 as it was then known), and an 11-item knowledge (true/false) section about influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the containment phase. Answers to the knowledge section were based on a review of the available literature, policies and guidelines produced by the Department of Health, HPA and World Health Organization at the time of the survey design.1, 4, 5, 7, 8 A pilot study was conducted on a convenience sample of West Midlands HPA staff who had worked in the FRC. As a result, a number of minor changes were made to the questionnaire. Survey Monkey was used to provide respondents with anonymized online access to the questionnaire.9 The link to the survey was emailed to former FRC staff on 23 October 2009, and two reminders were emailed at 2-week intervals. The email addresses used were provided by the FRC training manager, and no other identifying information was given. This meant that individual respondents could not be identified and reminders were therefore sent to all potential respondents. Data collection was closed on 30 November 2009.",

Clinicians clearly identified staying at home and frequent handwashing as preventive measures. However, more than half would have advised not travelling abroad in order to avoid infection, approximately half did not know the main age group affected during the containment phase, nearly one-third thought that antiviral drugs could cure infection, and just over one-quarter thought that wearing face masks in public places was protective. There is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures.7, 8 Potential explanations for these misconceptions cannot be addressed by this survey, and it is possible that they may have resulted in the provision of incorrect information to callers. These findings support previous research suggesting that during a public health emergency, clinicians should be provided with disease-specific education and training prior to working on a helpline.10\n",

The number, grade and profession of the individuals employed in the West Midlands FRC varied considerably, particularly at the peak of response, and few respondents had any previous experience of working in a call centre. The West Midlands FRC dealt with thousands of calls from health professionals and members of the public on a wide range of aspects, and keeping staffing levels aligned with the workload was a challenge, as was ensuring that staff received the required training. The extent to which the high proportion of staff with limited or no prior experience of working in a call centre may have affected the efficiency or effectiveness of the FRC in fulfilling its objectives is unknown. This is an area for potential future research.",

Another potential limitation is that the heterogeneous nature of the \u2018clinical\u2019 and \u2018non-clinical\u2019 groupings may have introduced error. Although the use of an electronic survey precluded detailed qualitative study, the method used allowed large-scale data collection in a timely, practical and cost-effective manner. Additionally, only West Midlands FRC staff were surveyed, service users were not examined, and no comparisons were made between West Midlands FRC staff and FRC staff in other regions.",
