Although not conceived for this application we frequently observed a specific fluorescent cytoplasmatic granular pattern, which was frequently associated with NPA from children with wheezing. As cross-reactivity with hepatitis A and astrovirus was unlikely in respiratory samples, and adenoviruses could be ruled-out by specific staining, our observations suggested a possible association between this fluorescent pattern and the detection of respiratory picornaviruses.",

The recognition of the positive staining pattern did not present any particular difficulties for experienced laboratory staff. Only 4 IF-ENVPAN positive NPA were negative using xTAG multiplex PCR. Unfortunately, the 4 discrepant specimens could not be retested due to a lack of frozen material. Moreover, xTAG multiplex PCR confirmed the IF-result in all six tested NPA with RSV co-infection. Thus a cross-reaction of IF-ENVPAN with other respiratory viruses appears to be most unlikely.

On the other hand, the enhanced sensitivity of molecular methods compared to IF for the detection of respiratory viruses20, 24, 25 should not only be regarded as being advantageous. Respiratory picornaviruses have also been detected by PCR in approximately 20% of subjects lacking respiratory symptoms.26, 27, 28, 29 Moreover, at least two reports have documented the recovery of respiratory picornaviruses by PCR for 2\u20133 week following acute respiratory illness.28, 29 Does the detection of respiratory picornaviruses nucleic acid represent the presence of virus without correlation with the current clinical symptoms, the persistence of virus genome following previous infection or an active infection?7, 28, 30 A major advantage of IF methods is, paradoxically, their relative insensitivity\u2014there has to be a substantial quantity of virus material present to score as positive.30 An IF positive result correlates well with an active infection.16 Furthermore, IF is much more flexible and much less expensive than molecular procedures: the results are available several time a day within 2\u20134 h and the preparation of new specimens can begin while earlier ones are being completed.16, 31 For all these reasons IF still retains advantages over PCR as a first-line test to guide clinicians.31\n",
