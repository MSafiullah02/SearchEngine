            "text": "Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by murine polyomavirus (MuPyV), a persistent natural mouse pathogen, establishes brain-resident memory CD8 T cells (bT RM ) that uniformly and chronically express programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) irrespective of the expression of \u03b1 E integrin CD103, a T RM cell marker. In contrast, memory antiviral CD8 T cells in the spleen are PD-1 \u2212 , despite viral loads being similar in both the brain and spleen during persistent infection. Repetitive antigen engagement is central to sustained PD-1 expression by T cells in chronic viral infections; however, recent evidence indicates that expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, is part of the T RM differentiation program. Here we asked whether PD-1 expression by CD8 bT RM cells during persistent MuPyV encephalitis is antigen dependent. By transferring MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM cells into the brains of naive mice and mice infected with cognate epitope-sufficient and -deficient MuPyVs, we demonstrate that antigen and inflammation are dispensable for PD-1 maintenance. In vitro and direct ex vivo analyses indicate that CD103 \u2212 MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM retain functional competence. We further show that the Pdcd-1 promoter of anti-MuPyV bT RM cells is epigenetically fixed in a demethylated state in the brain. In contrast, the PD-1 promoter of splenic antiviral memory CD8 T cells undergoes remethylation after being demethylated during acute infection. These data show that PD-1 expression is an intrinsic property of brain T RM cells in a persistent CNS viral infection.

            "text": "Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression has been proposed to constitute a facet of the resident memory CD8 T cells (T RM ) differentiation program to prevent inadvertent deployment of poised mRNAs for effector molecules. 1 In chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling upregulates PD-1 expression at the effector stage of the splenic CD8 T cell response, with sustained PD-1 driving differentiation of exhausted T (T EX ) cells to prevent immunopathology. 2, 3 The state of PD-1 expression and its dependence on antigen by tissue T RM during persistent viral infection remains to be defined. For example, CD8 brain T RM (bT RM ) cells from mice with acutely resolved vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encephalitis express PD-1 transcripts but not PD-1 receptors, whereas bT RMs from mice persistently infected with mouse cytomegalovirus are PD-1 + . [4] [5] [6] This discrepancy in PD-1 expression by bT RM cells raised the question whether antigen and/or inflammation is involved in maintenance of PD-1 expression by bT RM cells during central nervous system (CNS) infection. Tissue-intrinsic factors are also dominant determinants of the dependence on antigen for CD8 T RM cell generation and/or maintenance. Antigen is required for T RM cell formation and CD103 upregulation in the brain and dorsal root ganglion 5, 7, 8 but not in the skin, small intestine, female reproductive tract and salivary glands. 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] The role of antigen in maintenance of the expression of PD-1 and CD103 by CD8 T RM cells in the brain remains to be determined.",

We further show that maintenance of PD-1 expression by bT RM cells is independent of cognate viral antigen and inflammation. As seen for splenic virus-specific CD8 T cells in chronic LCMV infection, the pdcd-1 promoter of bT RM cells from MuPyV-infected mice remains demethylated.

At day 9 postinfection (p. i.), the magnitude of the endogenous LT206-specific CD8 response in the brain, kidney and spleen was similar to that of the donor TCR-I cells (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Both the endogenous D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells and the TCR-I cells in acutely infected mice expressed PD-1 and CD69, with those in the brain having the highest level of expression ( Figure 1a) ; notably, virus levels in these organs were similar at day 9 and also at day 30 p.i. (Figure 1b ). In addition to CD69, CD103 (\u03b1 E integrin) is often used identify T RM cells. 17 At day 9 p.i., D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs did not express CD103; however, by day 30 p.i., a fraction of CD103 + endogenous and donor CD8 T cells were seen in the brain but not in the kidney or spleen. Despite a decline in virus levels by day 30 p.i. (Figure 1b) , PD-1 expression was sustained on both endogenous D b LT206-specific CD8 T cells and TCR-I cells in the brain and kidney but not those in the spleen (Figure 1a) , as was CD69 (Figure 1a ). Analysis of PD-1 transcript levels in TCR-I cells from the spleen at days 8 and 30 p.i. showed that splenic memory TCR-I cells expressed lower PD-1 mRNA levels than those from the spleens of acutely infected mice, albeit this difference was not statistically significant ( Figure 1c ). Discordance between PD-1 mRNA levels and surface expression by CD8 T RM cells was similarly observed in the VSV acute encephalitis infection model. 4 To determine whether PD-1 functionally inhibited MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells, we assayed intracellular interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production by TCR-I cells after stimulation by LT206 peptide-pulsed PD-L1 + DC2.4 cells in the presence of a PD-L1 blocking monoclonal antibody (Ab). As shown in Figure 1d , PD-L1 blockade resulted in a significant increase in frequency of IFN-\u03b3 expressing TCR-I cells from brains, kidney and spleen of mice at day 9 p.i. At day 30 p.i., PD-1 blockade increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + cells only of brain-resident TCR-I cells, which expressed the highest levels of PD-1 among T cells from all the organs examined.",

Figure S2C) . These data suggest that TCR stimulation and the inflammatory environment of persistent MuPyV CNS infection are dispensable for maintenance of PD-1 expression by antiviral brain T RM cells. As shown in Figure 2d , donor TCR-I bT RM cells were predominantly CD103 + irrespective of the presence of antigen or inflammation in the recipient brains, suggesting preferential survival of the CD103 + population. Although fewer donor TCR-I bT RM cells were recovered from the brains of naive and MuPyV.A2-infected recipients than from MuPyV.LT206-infected mice at day 7 posttransfer (Figure 2e ), these CD8 bT RM cells were found to persist in the brains of naive recipients for 25 days (Supplementary Figure S1 ). To ask whether PD-1 expression was an intrinsic property of MuPyV-specific bT RM cells, TCR-I cells were isolated from the brains of mice at day 30 p.i. and transferred intravenously to either naive or MuPyV.LT206 i.c. infected Thy1.2 congenic recipients. No donor cells, however, were detected at day 7 posttransfer in either cohort (data not shown), a finding mirroring that of Wakim et al. 5 using the VSV acute encephalitis mouse model and supporting the concept that CNS-specific factors are required for maintenance of bT RM cells.",

            "text": "CD103 \u2212 MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM cells are functionally competent CD8 T RM cell populations defined by differential CD103 expression have been reported to vary in proliferative potential, transcriptome, antigen dependence and tissue distribution. 4, 5, 18, 19 CD103 expression by donor TCR-I cells, however, was higher than on the endogenous D b LT359 or D b LT206 CD8 T cells (Figures 2c and d) , a difference that may be linked to the higher survival potential of CD103 + cells in the brain. 5 We thus asked whether MuPyV-specific CD103 \u2212 CD8 T cells infiltrating the brain express phenotypic and functional characteristics of T-cell exhaustion. Both CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were maintained in the absence of circulating CD8 cells (Figure 3a) , suggesting that each of these populations is comprised of T RM cells. CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells also expressed similar levels of PD-1 and Tim3 (Figure 3b ). Of note, the CD103 \u2212 subset expressed higher TCF-1 levels and had higher proportion of CXCR5 hi TCF-1 hi cells compared with the CD103 + cells. Elevated TCF-1 expression as well as the presence of a CXCR5 hi TCF-1 hi population by memory CD8 T cells in chronic infection models have been reported to exhibit improved functional capability. 20,21 BLIMP-1 and Eomesodermin (EOMES) T-box transcription factors are highly expressed by exhausted CD8 T cells; 22, 23 however, CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were found to express lower BLIMP-1 and higher EOMES levels than the CD103 + cells. These populations also showed similar Ki67 expression levels, indicating their comparable rates of proliferation during persistent MuPyV CNS infection (Figure 3c ). Taken together, the pattern of expression of these molecules indicates that CD103 \u2212 cells lack a phenotype associated with T-cell exhaustion. Moreover, CD103 \u2212 and CD103 + LT359 peptide-stimulated CD8 T cells from the brains of persistent MuPyV-infected mice exhibited similar frequencies of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 3d ). To assess IFN-\u03b3 production directly ex vivo by CD103 \u2212 and CD103 + MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in the brains of persistently infected mice, IFN-\u03b3 EYFP reporter mice were inoculated with MuPyV.A2 virus i.c. As shown in Figure 3e , a higher fraction of CD103 + than CD103 \u2212 D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were EYFP + , a pattern paralleled by the expression of IRF4, a transcription factor upregulated by TCR stimulation. 24 The discrepancy between similar frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 bTRM cells following LT359 peptide stimulation vs lower EYFP + and IRF4 + by the CD103-population may reflect regional differences between the CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 cells in engaging viral antigen-expressing cells and/or differences in TCR affinity. 16 Although the CD103 integrin tethers T RM cells to E-Cadherin and is important for their preferential localization at epithelial tissues, CD103 \u2212 CD8 T RM cells exist in particular organs, including the brain. 5,25 CD103 expression by CD8 T RM cells may also be influenced by the nature of the viral infection, as lung CD8 T RM cells to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus express CD103, whereas those specific for human cytomegalovirus are CD103 \u2212 . 26 Demethylation of the PD-1 promoter by MuPyV-specific bT RM cells Using the mouse model of chronic LCMV infection, it has been previously demonstrated that the Pdcd1 promoter is extensively demethylated at early stages of the immune response. This locus was remethylated in the acutely resolved LCMV Armstrong infection but remained demethylated in chronic LCMV clone13 infection even after host control of infection, a result tying PD-1 to the exhaustion state of differentiation. 13, 14 Stability of the demethylated Pdcd1 promoter was further demonstrated in human EBV, CMV and HIV-specific CD8 T cells. 13, 27 It is yet to be confirmed whether the epigenetic changes observed at peripheral T EX cells holds true for bT RM cell population as well. The marked difference in PD-1 expression by memory MuPyVspecific CD8 T cells in the spleen and brain led us to ask whether cells in these organs differed in level and stability of Pdcd1 promoter demethylation. Pdcd1 methylation status was analyzed on Thy1.1 TCR-I CD8 cells sorted from the brains and spleens of acute (day 8 p.i.) and persistent (day 30 p.i.) infected recipient mice ( Figure 4a ). As expected, the Pdcd1 promoter in naive splenic TCR-I cells was almost entirely methylated (Figures 4b and e) . At day 8 p.i., TCR-I cells in both the spleen and brain exhibited extensive Pdcd1 promoter demethylation (Figures 4c and e) . By day 30 p.i., however, TCR-I cells in the spleen showed increased methylation of the Pdcd1 promoter, while brain TCR-I cells retained a demethylated Pdcd1 promoter (Figures 4d and f) . This intermediate level of methylation in TCR-I cells from day 30 infected mice was intermediate between cells from a naive or day 8-infected mice. This observation is consistent with the lower trending PD-1 transcript levels seen at day 30 p.i. (Figure 1c) . The PD-1 hi phenotype of the brain TCR-I T RM cells further suggests that a minimum threshold of Pdcd1 promoter demethylation facilitates upregulation of PD-1 gene expression. Thus these data show that the Pdcd1 promoter of CD8 bT RM cells remains more extensively demethylated than splenic memory CD8 T cells despite having similar persistent MuPyV infection levels.",

As shown in Figure 2c, PD-1 expression was similar among donor TCR-I T RM cells in the brains of mice regardless of expression of cognate epitope and/or virus-associated inflammation. CD69 and CD103 expression by the TCR-I cells in each recipient cohort was also similar and unchanged from the original donor TCR-I cells in Group 1 (Figure 2c). High expression of PD-1, CD103 and CD69 by the donor TCR-I T RM cells in naive recipients was maintained up to day 25 posttransfer (Supplementary Figure S1B). The possibility of MuPyV. LT206 virus carryover with the donor TCR-I cells is unlikely given the absence of detectable MuPyV DNA by quantitative PCR in the brains of uninfected recipients (Supplementary Figure S2A) and by the absence of D b LT206 tetramer binding the endogenous CD8 T cells either in the brain (Figure 2b) or in the spleen (Supplementary Figure S2B) of uninfected recipient mice. Naive TCR-I cells transferred into mice infected by MuPyV.A2 failed to proliferate and did not upregulate CD44, indicating that maintenance of PD-1 expression by TCR-I T RM cells in MuPyV.A2-infected recipients could not be attributed to cross-recognition of the D b LT359 epitope (Supplementary",
