The breakdown of endothelial barrier function, leading to vascular leak, edema, and organ failure, is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis [2, 3]. The endothelium is covered by a complex extracellular gel of both membrane-bound and more loosely attached proteins and glycans which collectively are referred to as the glycocalyx [4]. The glycocalyx has a number of important functions for vascular homeostasis. It acts as a sensor of shear stress, it provides receptor sites for a number of signaling molecules, it maintains an antithrombotic surface, and by creating a negatively charged fiber matrix, it contributes to the barrier function of the endothelium [5\u20137].",

Supporting a role for shedding of the glycocalyx in the pathophysiology of the critically ill are observational studies demonstrating plasma concentrations of syndecans are generally higher in non-survivors than in survivors [14\u201316] and experimental studies showing increased permeability for macromolecules following degradation of the glycocalyx [17, 18].",

The primary aim of this study was to determine whether plasma levels of any of the six glypicans are associated with the presence and development of organ failure in patients with infection.

The main cohort was taken from a prospective nonconsecutive convenience sample study of febrile adult patients with clinically suspected infection who were enrolled into the study upon admission to the Clinic for Infectious Diseases at Lund University Hospital (Lund, Sweden) between March 2006 to April 2008 [22]. Plasma samples were collected upon enrollment as described previously, using sodium citrate as the anticoagulant [22]. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Lund University Hospital (Diarie number 790/2005), and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their close relatives. Plasma samples were available from 184 patients with confirmed infection. This group of patients is hereafter referred to as the main cohort. Patients were classified based on presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, the presence or absence of organ failure, and the final diagnosis, according to the criteria proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine [21]. Because the Sepsis-3 criteria emphasize organ dysfunction in sepsis [1], we separated the patients into two groups: (1) infection with organ failure (sepsis; n = 64) and (2) infection without organ failure (n = 120). In some analyses, we further subdivided group 1 into two groups: (a) those that already had organ failure at the time of enrollment and sample collection (n = 37) and (b) those that developed organ failure after enrollment and sample collection (n = 27).",

Additionally, plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were strongly correlated with each other, suggesting that they may be shed together as part of a mass shedding of the glycocalyx. The signaling molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its main carrier protein apolipoprotein M (ApoM) are known to exert protective and regenerative effects on the glycocalyx [30]. Plasma levels of S1P were significantly negatively correlated with GPC 1 and 4, and plasma levels of ApoM were significantly negatively correlated with GPC 3 and 4, suggesting that a decrease of plasma levels of protective S1P/ApoM can be associated with GPC shedding.

The four syndecans have been systematically measured in the plasma of intensive care unit patients and showed that only syndecan-1 and 3 are elevated compared to healthy controls [14]. To our knowledge, a similar systematic study of glypican levels in plasma has never been carried out. In this study, we first measured all 6 glypicans in plasma of patients with sepsis. Our finding that three of the glypicans, GPC 1, 3, and 4, are elevated in the plasma of sepsis patients indicates that these components of the glycocalyx may be involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Additionally, we found that GPC 1, 3, and 4 were elevated in patients who later developed organ failure, indicating that their increase in plasma is not a consequence of organ failure, but rather a preceding event.",

Although all glypican expression decreases significantly in adulthood [31], GPC 1, 3, and 4 are still expressed in several organs and tissues in adults [26] and have been detected on the endothelium [32, 33]. The glycocalyx is shed extensively from the endothelium in sepsis and several of its components are found in the plasma during inflammatory conditions [10]. Alternately, mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells express GPC 3 while monocytes express GPC 4 [34]. Whether glypicans are shed from these cells in inflammatory conditions is unknown, but it is possible this could contribute to elevated GPC 3 and 4 in plasma. Glycocalyx components can also be shed from other cell types, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, in response to inflammation and cell stress [35]. Since GPC 1, 3, and 4 expression is found in many organs [26], it is also possible that some of the elevated GPC 1, 3, and 4 is derived from other cell types and has diffused into the blood.",

Heparan and chondroitin sulfate can be shed along with a proteoglycan core protein or can be removed by heparanases and chondroitinases. Mechanisms of glypican shedding are less well studied. In theory, glypicans can be released by three different mechanisms of shedding. First, glypicans are anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and so they can be shed from the membrane by phospholipases that cut the GPI moiety, freeing the whole protein core and the heparan sulfate chains from the membrane [36]. Phospholipase activity is altered in the plasma in sepsis [37, 38] and several bacteria can secrete phospholipases that could potentially sever the GPI anchor [39] so this shedding mechanism could be relevant in sepsis.",

            "text": "Glypicans can also be cleaved proteolytically by furin-like convertases [40]. Furin levels are unchanged in sepsis [41] so this mechanism of shedding is less likely. However, endoproteolytic cleavage of glypicans also occurs intracellularly prior to glypican trafficking to the cell surface [42]. This results in an N-terminal domain that is linked to the membrane-associated C-terminal domain only by disulfide bridges [40, 42]. Disulfide bonds are highly susceptible to breakage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during changes in oxidative conditions [43], which could lead to the release of glypican N-terminal domains from the cell surface, leaving the C-terminal domain, which contains the heparan sulfate chains [40], still attached to the membrane. Sepsis is associated with massive increases in ROS and changes in the redox state of the blood and cells [44], and so this shedding mechanism could also be relevant in sepsis. Measurement of plasma glypicans can therefore potentially provide information about phospholipase- and ROS-mediated glycocalyx damage, which is not available from measurement of syndecan, hyaluronan or heparan sulfate levels.",

We used commercial ELISA kits and measurement was done while blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients. Additionally the cohort was fairly large and the patients had a wide range of clinical diagnoses and disease severities. A limitation of this study is that we were not able to distinguish between glypicans produced by the endothelium or by other cells. Additionally we did not examine whether increased plasma glypican levels are due to glycocalyx shedding, which may compromise endothelial barrier function, or whether they simply reflect increased turnover of the glycocalyx with no effect on barrier function. Recent experimental data from mice suggests that sepsis both induces shedding and impairs regeneration of the glycocalyx [45]. Lastly, the glypican ELISAs used polyclonal antibodies to the whole glypican protein, making it impossible to distinguish between glypicans shed by cleavage of the GPI anchor or the disulfide bridges. The development of ELISAs specific to the different cleavage products would be required to determine which form of each glypican is present in plasma and to indicate which shedding mechanisms are relevant during sepsis.",
