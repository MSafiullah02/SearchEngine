Salmonellosis notification is particularly associated with high temperatures during the week prior to consumption of infected produce, implicating a mechanistic effect via poor food handling. \u2022 Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, viral infection of cloven-footed animals, including cattle, sheep, and pigs. Most transmission is by contact between infected and susceptible animals, or by contact with contaminated animal products. However, FMD can also spread on the wind. The survival of the virus is low at relative humidity (RH) below 60% [8] , and wind-borne spread is favored by the humid, cold weather common to temperate regions. In warmer drier regions, such as Africa, wind-borne spread of FMD is considered unimportant [9] . \u2022 Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, contagious, viral disease of small ruminants, especially goats, which is of great economic importance in parts of Africa and the Near East. It is transmitted mostly by aerosol droplets between animals in close contact. However, the appearance of clinical PPR is often associated with the onset of the rainy season or dry cold periods [10] , a pattern that may be related to viral survival.

High temperatures causing an increase in algal populations often precede cholera outbreaks. Disruption to normal rainfall helps cholera to spread further, either by flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, such as wells, or drought which can make the use of such water sources unavoidable. Contaminated water sources then become an important source of infection in people. \u2022 Plague is a flea-borne disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis; the fleas' rodent hosts bring them into proximity with humans. In Central Asia, large scale fluctuations in climate synchronize the rodent population dynamics over large areas [16] , allowing population density to rise over the critical threshold required for plague outbreaks to commence [17] . \u2022 African horse sickness (AHS), a lethal infectious disease of horses, is caused by a virus transmitted by Culicoides biting midges.

However, the clearest examples pertain to macroparasites (helminth worms) which, with the notable exception of Strongyloides spp., do not multiply within the host.

Eggs deposited in the feces of one season's lambs do not hatch straightaway; instead, they build up on the pasture during summer and remain as eggs over winter, not hatching until temperatures the following spring exceed 10 C [25] . Once the mean daily temperature exceeds this threshold the eggs hatch rapidly, leading to a sharp peak in the number of infective larvae on the pasture. If this coincides with the new season's lambs grazing on the pasture, there is likely to be a large uptake of larvae and severe disease, called nematodiriasis.

First, temperature and moisture frequently impose limits on their distribution. Often, low temperatures are limiting because of high winter mortality, or high temperatures because they involve excessive moisture loss. Therefore, cooler regions which were previously too cold for certain vectors may begin to allow them to flourish with climate change. Warmer regions could become even warmer and yet remain permissive for vectors if there is also increased precipitation or humidity.

Even with a decrease in future moisture levels, some vectors, such as certain species of mosquito, could become more abundant, at least in the vicinity of people and livestock, if the response to warming is more water storage and, thereby, the creation of new breeding sites. One of the most important vectors of the emerging Chikungunya virus (and to a lesser extent dengue virus) is the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) which is a container breeder and therefore thrives where humans store water. Equally, some vectors may be relatively insensitive to direct effects of climate change, such as muscids which breed in organic matter or debris, and myiasis flies which breed in hosts' skin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effects on Vectors"}, {"text": "Changes to temperature and moisture will also lead to increases or decreases in the abundance of many disease vectors. This may also result from a change in the frequency of extreme weather events such as ENSO. Outbreaks of several biting midge and mosquito-borne diseases, for example, have been linked to the occurrence of ENSO [18, 22, [59] [60] [61] [62] and mediated, at least in part, by increase in the vector population size in response to heavy rainfall, or rainfall succeeding drought, that ENSO sometimes brings [18, 22] . Greater intra-or interannual variation in rainfall, linked or unlinked to ENSO, may lead to an increase in the frequency or scale of outbreaks of such diseases. The ability of some insect vectors to become or remain infected with pathogens (their vector competence) varies with temperature [63, 64] . In addition to this effect on vector competence, an increase in temperature may alter the balance between the lifespan of an infected vector, its frequency of feeding, and the time necessary for the maturation of the pathogen within it. This balance is critical, as a key component of the risk of transmission of a vector-borne disease is the number of blood meals taken by a vector between the time it becomes infectious and its death [65] . Accordingly, rising ambient temperature can increase the risk of pathogen transmission by shortening the time until infectiousness in the vector and increasing its feeding frequency at a faster rate than it shortens the vector's lifespan, such that the number of feeds taken by an infectious vector increases. However, at even higher temperatures this can reverse [66] such that the number of infectious feeds then decreases relative to that possible at lower temperatures. This point is extremely important, as it means that the risk of transmission of vector-borne pathogens does not uniformly increase with rising temperature, but that it can become too hot and transmission rates decrease. This effect will be most important for short-lived vectors such as biting midges and mosquitoes [30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 334, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 335, "end": 338, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 528, "end": 531, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 824, "end": 828, "text": "[63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1275, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2072, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effects on Vectors"}, {"text": "Lastly, there may be important effects of climate change on vector dispersal, particularly if there is a change in wind patterns.

In this model, temporal variation in transmission risk is derived from the influence of climate (mainly temperature and rainfall) on the abundance of the vector species, and from the influence of temperature alone on the ability of the vectors to transmit the causative virus. As described earlier, this arises from the balance between vector longevity, vector feeding frequency, and the time required for the vector to become infectious. Spatial variation in transmission risk is derived from these same climate-driven influences and, additionally, differing densities of sheep and cattle. This integrated model successfully reproduces many aspects of bluetongue's distribution and occurrence, both past and present, in Western Europe, including its emergence in northwest Europe in 2006. The model gives this specific year the highest positive anomaly (relative to the long-term average) for the risk of bluetongue transmission since at least 1960, but suggests that other years were also at much higher-than-average risk.
