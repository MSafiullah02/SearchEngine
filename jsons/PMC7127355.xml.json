Many studies reported its healthy benefits, such as antioxidation [1], cardiovascular protection [2], hepato-protective effect [3], antiarrhythmic effect [4] and anticomplementary activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome [5]. A new drug candidate of Flos Chrysanthemi extract (FCE) for treatment of cardiovascular disease had been in clinical trial in China [6]. Luteolin (3\u2032, 4\u2032, 5, 7-tetrahydroxyflavone) and apigenin (4\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone) (Fig. 1\n) are two main bioactive ingredients FCE. These two typical flavonoids also widely distribute in fruits and vegetables, which exhibit as anticancer [7], [8], [9], [10] or cancer preventive [11], anti-inflammatory [12], [13], neuroprotective [14], [15] agents in the past studies.",

Recently, luteolin had been identified to be a good substrate of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and two methylated metabolites of luteolin, chrysoeriol (4\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxy-3\u2032-methoxyflavone) and diosmetin (3\u2032, 5, 7-trihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavone), were identified in the rat plasma after hydrolylsis treatment when intravenously given luteolin to rats [16]. Since these flavonoids occurred mainly as glucuronidated and sulfated forms in the blood circulation, and there was lack of standard compounds of these glucuronidated and sulfated flavonoids, the total forms (free, glucuronidated and sulfated) flavonoids were analyzed after a hydrolysis treatment in our previous study [21].",

Since chrysoeriol and diosmetin were with similar structures, close LogP values and shared the same mass spectrum [16], an optimized chromatographic condition was very important in the present study. In our study, an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) was applied to separate these flavonoids. To get a suitable mobile phase condition, the mixtures of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile, or 0.1% formic acid and methanol, and the three above were compared, the combination of the three components in the mobile phase was found to make a well separation. After optimizing the proportion of acetonitrile and methanol, a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid, acetonitrile and methanol (60:16:24, v/v/v) was determined. In addition, chrysoeriol and diosmetin still had free hydroxyl, which could be further conjugated by UGTs or SULTs, therefore a hydrolysis treatment of sample was very important to assay the methylated metabolites of luteolin in vivo.",

Because luteolin could be methylated by COMT but not apigenin, so it was speculated that COMT might be a mechanism responsible for the pharmacokinetics differences between luteolin and apigenin when oral FCE to rats [22]. The present study directly evaluated the role of COMT in vivo in disposition of luteolin after oral dose of FCE to rats. However, the increase in concentrations of luteolin by COMT inhibition was limited, which could not reverse the pharmacokinetics differences between luteolin and apigenin. It was possible that the inhibition of COMT by entacapone was limited due to the very wide tissue distribution of COMT in vivo, and/or other metabolism enzymes, such as UGTs and SULTs, especially in the small intestinal could compete with COMT to decrease the contribution of COMT to disposition of luteolin. The concentrations of apigenin were also increased by entacapone, but the mechanism for this was unclear and needs further investigation.",
