Communication between different cell types of the immune system is critical in the recognition of self, surveillance, defense, and clearance of foreign invaders [1, 2]. These signaling mechanisms involve direct cell\u2013cell signaling as well as autocrine and paracrine signaling. Direct cell to cell signaling is the best presented through antigen presentation of antigen presenting cells [macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) and B-cells] to T-na\u00efve cells which will process the information on antigen epitopal features through T-Cell Receptor (TCR) and become educated, memory T-cells. This principle is used in rational designed vaccines (RVD) against bacteria and viruses, especially. B-cells also have a memory after acquiring antigen, but that process in the B-cells is less understood, although interesting novel discoveries are emerging [2\u20135]. The molecular base of immune system memory cells is still elusive and although we are using the term, we still do not understand the fundamental processes leading to that memory. Yet, with existing knowledge in mind we can design successful vaccines sometimes. There is still a lot to be understood about this very subtitle type of communication.",

Almost all cells in the organism can be infected and they possess MHC molecules, but only immune system, Antigen Presenting Cells can efficiently communicate to T-cells through their MHC molecule and TCR of T-cells in order to prime them and teach them about antigen epitope features. In response, T-cells (T CD4+ and/or TCD8+) will either produce spectrum of cytokines in response in order to induce the production of specific antibodies from B-cells, or express cell-mediated cytotoxicity and kill infected cells, thus eliminating antigen [6].",

The body contains an inventory or repertoire of T cells bearing a large variety of a very different TCRs; each version of TCR is capable of recognizing a single antigen, so that population contains T-cells, that will recognize virtually any antigen. Each T-cell expresses only one type of TCR, specific for a particular antigen. Thus, millions of T-cells each with an antigen specific receptor continually sample the surface of Apes to determine whether the presented peptide matches the binding site for the receptor they carry. This scanning process takes place in the lymph draining nodes where circulating APCs and T cells most meet. T cell briefly binds to MHC-peptide complex on the surface of APC. It is not a simple matching process but requires multiple signals: the involvement of co-stimulatory molecules, for full T-cell activation (B7 has to match to CD28). When a match occurs, signal transduction pathways are activated. This, multiple receptor-legend interactions must simultaneously occur before the specialized signal of antigen recognition can be transduced into T-cell. After recognition, T-cells will be activated and undergo clonal expansion caused by autocrine signaling of a cytokines called interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is a growth factor. Thus, many copies of the antigen-specific T-cells are produced.",

The word vaccine is derived from vacca, (Latin for cow) [7]. The science of vaccination began with Edward Jenner in 1796 and his observation that milk maids who contracted cowpox due to their exposure to farm cows became immune to small pox from the pus in the blisters formed by cowpox [8]. Jenner subsequently tested his hypothesis on an 8-year old boy and was successful [8]. He inoculated the boy with cowpox blisters initially from which he developed only a mild illness. Later the same boy was inoculated with small pox or variola particles. The child showed immunity developing no sign of disease [8]. Thus, a new field of preventive medicine was born and vaccine development has been a major biomedical concern ever since.",

Even though vaccination is probably the most beneficial therapy that a physician can provide a patient, there are still significant roadblocks to the development and licensing of new vaccines [9]. The greatest roadblock is the lack of a complete understanding of how the human immune system \u201cworks\u201d. Early vaccines were developed using technology from the 19th and 20th centuries: inactivation by heat, chemicals, and irradiation to produce a killed vaccine, vaccination with a serologically related virus a\u2019 la Jenner, and attenuation by tissue culture passage to produce live vaccines with substantially reduced virulence [9]. These methodologies have failed to usher in vaccines against new and emerging diseases. Unmet targets for vaccine development include some of the more difficult infectious agents, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, cytomegalovirus, Dengue virus, Human Parvovirus B19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhea, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis; and parasitic diseases, such as malaria or hookworm disease [9, 10]. In the upcoming years vaccines towards diseases of this caliber will be developed by improvements on the basic techniques mentioned above and through the use of new technologies based on the expanding understanding of the immune response [9, 10].",

Once activated the B cell undergoes a process referred to as proliferation or clonal expansion [13, 15]. During clonal expansion the activated B cell proliferates into two classes of cells: plasma or effector cells and memory cells [8]. Effector B cells or plasma cells secrete antibodies while memory cells are long-lived and responsible for the enhanced secondary response to an antigen [13]. B cell proliferation serves two purposes. The first is to produce additional cells that can search the body for the pathogen bearing the epitope and the second is to confer immunity to the human host. This is achieved by the effector cells and memory cells respectively. Without B cells there are no antibodies, the two immune system components that mediate the humoral response. Thus vaccination towards any pathogen must seek to activate B cells.",

It has a preference for interacting with the MHC-1 receptors and antigens [13].

Dendritic cells are the APCs that are most effective at activating CD8+ T cells [14, 15].",
