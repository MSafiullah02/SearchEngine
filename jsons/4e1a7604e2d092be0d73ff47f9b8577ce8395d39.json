Following a decree of the president of the council of ministers on March 9, 2020, people who had moved to the north of the country for mainly work or study purposes returned to their families in the southern regions, thus bringing the infection to these areas. The occurrence of this event led to a need to develop strategies aimed at containing and recording the movements of patients entering hospital settings, and including cancer patients. Based on the scientific literature, 19.4% of coronavirus deaths have occurred in people with oncological comorbidities. This data indicates a connection between anticancer therapies and susceptibility to coronavirus, particularly among lung cancer patients. About 28% of patients are affected by this pathology (1, 2) .",

In fact, SARS-CoV-2 binds to alveolar epithelial cells and activates the innate and adaptive immune systems, which results in the release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6. In addition, because of the role of these pro-inflammatory factors, vascular permeability increases and a large number of fluid and blood cells enter the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea and even respiratory failure (5) .",
