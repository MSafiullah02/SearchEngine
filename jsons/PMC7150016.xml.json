The Congo River/Forest Basin has been shown to be one of the \u2018hot spots\u2019 for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. For example, in the recent past in Uganda alone, there have been outbreaks of Ebola, yellow fever, and anthrax. The Health Alliance, an existing network of six schools of public health from six countries in this hot spot (Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia) worked to strengthen public health education and systems, including emergency preparedness and response. After collaborating across universities (with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support) for 5 years, the Health Alliance, recognizing that 60% of new, emerging, or reemerging diseases have animal origins, sought to widen its scope to evolve into a One Health network to more effectively combat the spread of these diseases (One Health Commission, 2016; OHCEA, 2015).",

In 2005\u201306, facing the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, most African countries established multisectoral committees to help address the threat.

In 2011 the two schools expanded its membership to schools of veterinary medicine in the region to form what became known as OHCEA. The mission of LIPHEA was leadership in management of disasters and personnel training. The activities of LIPHEA were funded by USAID through the Higher Education until 2009. The main US partner in the LIPHEA team was the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (OHCEA, 2015\n; USAID, 2014a;\nOne Health Commission, 2016). Inspired by the evolution of One Health, LIPHEA invited schools of veterinary medicine in the region to join hands in the formation of OHCEA which gradually moved from disaster preparedness and response to OHW strengthening in participating countries. Based on opportunities available within the EPT program, OHCEA quickly became engaged with OHW strengthening in the participating countries.",

The sites consist of areas where there is high interaction between humans, animals (both domestic and wildlife), and the environment, thereby providing learning environments for One Health for both preservice and in-service personnel. These are \u2018hot spots\u2019 for EPT where disease agents of epidemic potential can be more easily detected than in other places. At these sites, university students from both human health and animal health disciplines are attached to work together in bridging the existing silos which have been stereotyped by their professions.

A case in point is Tanzania where existing One Health networks have met several times to discuss coordinating issues. The following are some of the networks: African Research Consortium for Ecosystem and Population Health (Afrique One), African Natural Products Research and Training Network (AFNNET), Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS), Cysticercosis Working Group in East and Southern Africa (CGWESA), in addition to OHCEA and other smaller ones.
