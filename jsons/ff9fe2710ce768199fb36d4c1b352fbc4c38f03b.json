            "text": "Due to significant advances in microbiome science over the past two decades, we are at the brink of a paradigm shift regarding the role of microbes in disease and health, from the Germ Theory of Disease to the Microbial Theory of Health. 1, 2 This shift will necessitate a change in the approaches that we take to design targeted infection control. In particular, we will need to leverage our knowledge of the microbiome when attempting to reduce the risk posed by infectious agents through use of targeted hygiene, and by fostering/balancing exposure to naturally diverse microbial communities. Interestingly, health-care providers have started shifting their own emphasis in this direction by promoting critical care microbiome research/applications that treat dysbiosis in intensive care patients, an ambitious but encouraging goal. 3 Recently, a more pragmatic use of antibiotics for treatment/prevention of infectious diseases has also been suggested by Rook and coworkers. 4 The revised viewpoints mentioned here are likely to have a profound effect on hygiene policies. 5 On the one hand, community-based infections \u02d7 including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin infections \u02d7 continue to exert a heavy toll on human health and prosperity. 6 We use the term \"community\" in a broad sense to include both home environments as well as school, workplace, and even recreational settings. This problem is exacerbated by the aging of the population as a whole, and the associated increase in percentage (now ~20%) of immunocompromised individuals living in the community. The latter are often cared for at home. 7 Contrary to optimistic predictions made during the mid-20th century, 8 ",

The government of the United Kingdom has referred to this issue as a \"post-antibiotic apocalypse\", which threatens to kill ten million people globally by 2050. 9 There also currently is much concern about the rapid rise in allergies (especially asthma and food allergies) and other chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) in the population. The Hygiene Hypothesis proposed by Strachan 10 postulated that a lower incidence of early childhood infection (predominantly in first-world countries) might explain the rapid rise of allergic diseases during the 20 th century. As discussed in a 2016 review by Bloomfield et al., 11 our current understanding of host-microbiome interactions and immune dysfunction suggests that increases in CID are, instead, the combined result of lifestyle, nutrition, medical, and public health (hygiene and sanitation) changes. These changes are thought to have deprived humans of exposure to potentially beneficial microbial agents (described as Old Friends (OF)), particularly in early life. 11 These OF microbes are not pathogenic, as argued by Strachan, 10 but rather include nonharmful diverse microbial species that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract and our natural environment. While the identity of the most important OF microbes may not be clear, our attitudes towards such non-pathogenic microbes must change. Thus, the concept of ageappropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life has emerged. 11 Such practices include age-appropriate vaccination and exposure to non-harmful microbes that beneficially prime the developing immune system. 12, 13 This strategy has the goal of balancing targeted hygiene with maintaining the natural diversity of the human and indoor microbiomes.",

More recently, it has been argued that the Hygiene Hypothesis is flawed, but despite this, broad acceptance of the theory had been encouraged by a phenomenon known as citation bias. Namely, it was found that publications supportive of the Hygiene Hypothesis were cited more often than non-supportive publications. 14 We believe it is time to restore public understanding of hygiene, and specifically targeted hygiene, as a tool for preventing transmission of pathogens (breaking the chain of infection) and, consequently, transmission of infectious diseases. 11 This is consistent with efforts of the infection control communities and public health agencies worldwide toward emphasizing the necessity of basic hygiene practices, at both the individual and community levels, for infection control. Most importantly, hygiene is now being seen as a key component of strategies intended to tackle the global problem of antibiotic resistance. 15, 16 It is hoped that, by reducing the level of infectious agent exposure, fewer people will need to seek antibiotic treatment \u02d7 thereby limiting the selective pressure for generating antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) and the associated antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.

In fact, a constant dynamic exists between the home and other community settings (e.g., day care, work, school, travel, leisure, healthcare, etc.) in terms of the dissemination of infectious agents from infected individuals, contaminated food, and domestic animals to surfaces and, via the intermediacy of human hands, through the entire cycle of reinfection. 1 Day care settings represent an especially high risk, as young children are immunologically immature and exhibit behaviors that actually encourage transmission of infectious agents (e.g., poor personal hygiene and mouthing of objects).",

Common-touch surfaces ( Targeting those surfaces at high risk for pathogen transmission/acquisition by hosts, and applying appropriate decontamination practices, form the basis for an evidence-based hygiene policy known as targeted hygiene. The historical approach to pathogen reduction on environmental surfaces has involved attempts to indiscriminately reduce microbes naturally present in those areas without regard for whether these represent low-or high-risk surfaces. For instance, advertisements in the popular media have implied that, for maintaining health, all germs must be eradicated from our environments. Such an impractical approach has not accounted for the possible beneficial impact of non-pathogenic (OF) microorganisms comprising a naturally diverse vs. dysbiotic indoor microbiome. We still have much to learn about such beneficial OF microbes. Targeted hygiene, on the other hand, is intended to manage the natural microbial diversity 24 of environmental surfaces as well as the human microbiome, 11 incorporating the novel concept of bygiene or bi-directional hygiene. 25 How is this to be accomplished?",

This is in distinct contrast to the Hygiene Hypothesis, which maintains that exposure to microbes (including some pathogens) is necessary, and certain health issues have arisen due to our overemphasis on sanitation. Another way of properly considering hygiene has been formulated by Vandegrift et al. 26 as \"those actions and practices that reduce the spread or transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, and thus reduce the incidence of disease.\"",

Application have been described for mitigation of the formation of biofilms 29 and for the use of copper surfaces for high risk surfaces (e.g., door knobs). It has been reported, however, that microorganisms may acquire a variety of defense mechanisms to such microbicidal metals. 30 Knowledge of the impacts of disruption of microbiomes on health also can inform the use of microbicides. For instance, recent studies of the oral microbiome have suggested that altering the natural diversity of microorganisms (dysbiosis) may lead to periodontal disease. 31 This argues for treatments aimed at tailoring the oral microbiome, rather than simply attempting to eliminate oral microbial populations altogether. Similarly, perturbations in the microbiome within the gastrointestinal tract have been proposed to lead to inflammatory diseases. 32 The human skin microbiome of healthy adults is relatively stable and resilient. 33 However, there appears to be a much more highly diverse skin microbiome associated with isolated populations such as the Yanomami Amerindians of Venezuela, who have been devoid of contact with individuals from developed countries and to the hygiene practices of those countries. 34 The comparative study of such isolated communities suggests that westernization and urbanization has led to a substantial reduction in exposure to the diversity of beneficial environmental microorganisms our ancestors likely were exposed to for millennia. Such exposure is thought to be essential for appropriate development of our immune systems and prevention of acquiring allergies. 25 Susceptibility to disruption of the skin microbiome of individuals living in megacities has been reported by Kim et al. 35 Air pollutants present in certain megacities may also impact the outdoor microbiome, though the potential impacts have yet to be elucidated. Impacts of pollutants on the pharyngeal microbiome are being investigated, and indicate alterations in taxonomic composition. 36 The skin microbiomes were shown to be impacted by factors such as environment and socioeconomic status. Outdoor environment physical activity may also contribute to the acquisition of the human microbiome via skin and airways. 11 On the other hand, the composition of the indoor microbiome seems to be more transient than the human microbiome. 37 The modern home should not be considered a natural setting, and the composition of the indoor microbiome in such dwellings is not stable, being heavily influenced by the daily activities of the human, domestic animal, and plant inhabitants, as well as by external factors such as pollution and other chemical contributors to our exposome. 38 The types of shelters or habitats in which our ancestors lived in the distant past would have provided continuous exposure to external elements such as dirt, animals, plants, and natural water sources.",

For instance, in the future there may become available products containing probiotics, beneficial environmental bacteria, or components of these bacteria capable of interacting with the developing immune system in a manner that reduces the types of allergic reactions now being seen in children.

Infectious agents have been found to survive on indoor environmental surfaces for extended periods of time, in many instances remaining for days to months at populations high enough to initiate infection of a new host. The duration of persistence is determined by the characteristics of the pathogen and of the surface itself, and other environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity and the organic matrix associated with the pathogens. The health implications of such persisting pathogen loads are dependent, to some extent, on the human infectious doses for the microbes, which can range from 1 to 10 infectious units for some hemorrhagic fever viruses 23 (e.g., Ebola virus) to thousands of infectious units forStaphylococcus aureus. High-risk common-touch surfaces for transmission of pathogens in the home or outside of the home (school, workplace, recreational settings) (from Scott et al. 1 ; adapted from Alum et al. 20 ). The cycle of infection and reinfection involves dissemination, primarily through the intermediacy of the hand, from common-touch surfaces to new surfaces and/or other hosts. This cycle includes: 1) pathogen release from an infected source; 2) contamination of common-touch surfaces by released pathogens; 3) persistence of the pathogen on the contaminated surface; 4) transfer of pathogens to secondary common touch surfaces; 5) pathogen transfer to a new host; and 6) infection of the new host with consequent spread of the associated disease. This cycle may be interrupted through the timely use of effective targeted hygiene practices and the judicial use of effective microbicides. The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19, emerging late in 2019, is a good example of the need for microbicidal agents to interrupt the cycle of infection. COVID-19 is primarily a lower respiratory syndrome, with some enteric and multisystem impacts, therefore SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated through the very same steps discussed above. Pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 must be targeted for decontamination using the various microbicidal agents having adequate efficacy (see section below on microbicidal efficacy). The points to be considered in developing targeted surface decontamination practices include: a) the probability of significant pathogen contamination at the targeted high-risk (commontouch) surface under consideration; b) the types of pathogens that are most likely to survive on surfaces and the time periods over which these might remain infectious at levels in excess of the minimum human infectious dose; c) the likelihood of pathogen transfer from the contaminated surface to human hands and to other surfaces and hosts; and d) the susceptibility of the new hosts to acquiring infection.",
