CTLs recognize antigenic peptides, in the context of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, viatheir TCR and, upon recognition, lyse these target cells. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively measure antigen-specific T-cells accurately and promptly. Until the development of MHC-I tetramer technology, the main techniques for functional and quantitative measurement of antigen-specific T-cells were limiting dilution assay (LDA), enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in conjunction with flow cytometry (Taswell, 1981, Jung, 1993, Scheibenbogen et al., 1997, Scheibenbogen et al., 2000).",

Moreover, the genomic structure of Leghorn chicken MHC has also been reported by Kaufman et al. (1999). Within a 44 kb DNA segment, there are two loci-encoding class I heavy chains named BF1 and BF2. The BF2 locus is dominantly expressed, whereas the BF1 locus is less expressed and has a lower mRNA transcript (Kaufman et al., 1999, Miller et al., 2004). However, despite this knowledge of the MHC-I sequence and genomic structure, no chicken MHC-I tetramer has been reported.

Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the entire coding region of BF2*15 and Ch\u03b22m cDNA sequences reported in GenBank (accession numbers: L28958 and M84767); the sequences of forward and reverse primers of the BF2*15 and Ch\u03b22m were as follows: BF2*15 forward: 5\u2032-TGC AGC GGT GCG AGG CGA T-3\u2032, BF2*15 reverse: 5\u2032-TTA TTT CAC AGG AAG CAG TGC-3\u2032; Ch\u03b22m forward: 5\u2032-ACA GCG GAG CCA TGG GGA A-3\u2032, Ch\u03b22m reverse: 5\u2032-ATC CCG GGC ACA GCT CAG A-3\u2032. Reverse transcription reaction was conducted at 42 \u00b0C for 2 h using AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). PCR amplifications were performed using the LA-Taq DNA polymerase system (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) under the following conditions: starting at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min for denaturation, followed by 35 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and then at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min for extension. The PCR products were inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The positive clones with the correct sequence were named as pMD-BF2*15 and pMD-Ch\u03b22m. The signal peptides of BF2*15 and Ch\u03b22m genes were predicted with SignalP (Bendtsen et al., 2004) and the sequence of the signal peptide in the BF2*15 gene was deleted. In addition, a 15-amino acid residue substrate peptide for BirA-dependent biotinylation was fused to the COOH terminus of BF2*15 through the EcoRI and HindIII site adapters with the forward primer 5\u2032-GGA ATT CAT GGG GCC GTG CGG GG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-GCG CAA GCT TTT AAC GAT GAT TCC ACA CCA TTT TCT GTG CAT CCA GAA TAT GAT GCA GGA TGG AGG GGT TGC TCC CGG G-3\u2032, using the pMD-BF2*15 plasmid as the template.

The amplified DNAs were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-28a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the EcoRI/HindIII site. Clones with the correct inserts were identified using PCR and restriction analysis of vectors carrying the recombinant DNA. Finally, the nucleotide sequences of the selected clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The positive clones were named as pET-BF2*15-BSP and pET-Ch\u03b22m.",

When the T-cells interact with the target cells, the T-cells recognize both the antigen displayed in cleft and MHC molecules. So, in this experiment, the positive signal detected in the two-color flow cytometry assay was enough to illustrate the peptide-specific CTL. However, it could be better to understand the peptide-specific CTL if there are two more controls, that is, to use the chickens with different MHC types and chickens infected with a different virus.",

Besides its potential use in the study of the overall evaluation of the T cell immune response, this tetramer can also be used to track the kinetics of the IBV-specific CTL response. Also, the BF2 tetramer can be used for the evaluation on CTL response specific to other chicken viruses by replacing the peptide in the peptide-binding groove of BF2 during refolding procedure. Additionally, few BF2-restricted T cell epitopes have been identified, thus far. The prepared BF2*15-peptide tetramer can be used as an effective tool for mapping the BF2-restricted T cell epitopes. Once more BF2-restricted T cell epitopes have been mapped, this BF2*15-peptide tetramer can be more effectively used to investigate the CTL response to viral infection in the chicken.",
