Plague has three major clinical forms, bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic, but the highest concern is for the pneumonic form which allows for direct person-to-person transmission via infectious respiratory droplets and therefore remains a serious public health threat. Thus, due attention should be given to public health preparedness including prevention and early detection. Vaccines are effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases. However, there is no approved plague vaccine and vaccine development efforts are hampered by a lack of reliable markers of protection.",

Subunit vaccines containing F1 capsular and virulence (V) antigens show the most promising results. A vaccine that had F1 and V antigens mixed with alhydrogel adjuvant was shown to elicit antibody responses in humans, but without measurable CMI.11 Interestingly, the post-vaccination sera from this clinical trial protected mice from lethal Yp challenge. Similarly, a recent dose titration clinical trial with a new F1/V subunit vaccine containing flagellin as an adjuvant conducted by the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) network showed good antibody responses at 6 and 10 \u03bcg, again in the absence of significant CMI.12 This vaccine was shown to induce excellent antibody responses in mice and non-human primates (NHP), and protect mice against respiratory challenge with Yp.13 The protective capacity of antibody responses induced by flagellin-adjuvanted F1/V plague vaccine in humans remains to be studied. The lack of CMI from both clinical trials with subunit vaccines was unexpected because these same subunit vaccines have been shown to elicit protective CMI in animal models.4,5,10 One possible explanation for the lack of measurable vaccine-specific CMI found in subunit plague vaccine trials is the limitation of the in vitro assays used (e.g., antigen concentration and duration of in vitro restimulation of T cells). In the first trial, the T-cell activation markers and gross changes in T-cell counts were measured ex vivo without antigenic restimulation.11 In the recently completed VTEU clinical trial,12 only 24 h stimulation with F1/V antigens was used before collection of culture supernatants for cytokine quantification. Vaccine-specific T cells are generally of low frequency and can be measured reliably only after optimal in vitro stimulation.14 This study was carried out with the objectives of evaluating the protective function of antibodies elicited by flagellin adjuvanted F1/V vaccine, reevaluating vaccine-induced T-cell responses using optimal in vitro restimulation conditions, and identifying gene expression markers of good vaccine-induced immune responses.",

Therefore, a new assay that measures the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to protect lysis of macrophages by a recombinant Yersinia expressing V antigen has been developed.17,22 Yptb appears to be better than Yp for this assay because Yptb activates apoptosis much more effectively than Yp in vitro.23 We tested this assay for the first time on human sera using pre- and post-vaccination samples from a recent clinical trial where we used Flagellin/F1/V subunit vaccine.12 Flagellin/F1/V is composed of a single protein incorporating the amino and carboxyl regions of flagellin from Salmonella enteritidis and the two antigenic peptides from Yp.13 Flagellin is a potent inducer of innate immunity, mainly because of its direct interaction with toll-like receptor 5.24,25 This new flagellin adjuvanted F1/V vaccine was shown to induce good antibody response in a recent clinical trial. Now, we demonstrate that post vaccination sera from individuals vaccinated with Flagellin/F1/V vaccine protect macrophages from apoptosis caused by infection of Yptb expressing V antigen (median increase of 75% in protective levels on day 42). It has been shown that the extent to which caspase 3 levels decrease was significantly associated with survival of NHP after aerosol challenge with Yp.17,22 Using the survival models as described by Welkos et al.22 for NHP for day 70 post-challenge, the NHP survival rate would be estimated at ~73% assuming protective levels as observed on day 56 (28 days post-second vaccination) in our study. Our results indicated that there was a significant correlation between caspase-3 values and the anti-V ELISA IgG titer but not against anti-F1 ELISA. This is because the recombinant Yptb that we used in our assay to measure macrophage-protective antibody responses expresses V but not F antigen; therefore, macrophage protection is likely rendered by antibodies against V antigen.",

            "text": "The roles of T-cell immunity in protection against Yp are increasingly recognized. Treatment of mice with exogenous IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 inhibits multiplication of Yersinia and protects against lethal challenge.26 Similarly, neutralization of endogenous IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 make mice more vulnerable to pneumonic plague.6 In addition, passive transfer of cells from Yersinia enterocolitica convalescent mice partially protects na\u00efve mice against Yp challenge.27,28 Further studies identified that CD4 and CD8 T cells are the main cell types conferring Yp immunity in mice, with CD4 T cells improving the cytotoxic effect of CD8 T cells, but not having a significant effect by themselves.29 Induction of T-cell immunity may depend on the adjuvants or vaccine types.30\u201332 SA-4-1BBL adjuvant improved Th1 immune response induced by alum-adjuvanted F1/V subunit vaccine.30 In a recent murine study, flagellin adjuvanted subunit vaccine has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.33 Multiple antigen peptide constructs of V antigen increases lymphoproliferative responses in mice, with highest levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in culture supernatants.34 IL-17 appears to mediate enhanced mucosal protection, and neutralization of vaccine-induced IL-17 decreases the survival of mice following challenge with Yp.32 Our results similarly showed that Flagellin/F1/V vaccine significantly increased the number of proliferating and IL-10 or IL-4 producing CD4 T cells. In addition, we showed that this flagellin-adjuvanted F1/V vaccination induced polyfunctional CD4 T cells, which proliferate and produce both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. It has previously been shown that neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 interferes with the capacity of anti-V antibodies to decrease bacterial burden or increase survival in murine model.9 While we found no significant correlation between IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cell and the antibody response, we did find a significant negative correlation for IL-6-producing CD4 T cell in our study. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced mainly by monocytes35 to promote Th2 and Th17 differentiation as well as enhance antibody production.36,37 In our study, the IL-6 levels in supernatants of cultures containing post-vaccination PBMC were not different from the pre-vaccination levels. Activated lymphocytes also produce IL-6 which has autocrine function, mainly inducing Th2 responses.38 In our study, the strongest negative correlation was between changes in IL-6-producing CD4+ T cells and macrophage protection on day 14 post-second vaccination (P = 0.026, Spearman r = \u22120.57) suggesting that IL-6 from CD4 T cells may not be a major factor to induce macrophage protective antibody responses. However, because we did not measure IL-6 produced by other major specific cell types such as monocytes, our result may not show the overall effects of IL-6 on macrophage protective responses.",

            "text": "Unlike infection with attenuated strains of Yp, infection of mice and brown Norway rats with wild-type Yp suppresses several genes including genes for antigen processing and presentation, T-cell receptor (TCR)-signaling, NF-kB signaling, and natural killer (NK) cell function.39 The length of time after infection with Yp or stage of disease affects gene expression, with genes for Th1 immune response induced only at the initial or the recovery stage.39,40 To our knowledge, there are no host transcriptomics studies following vaccination with F1/V subunit vaccine. In this study using RNA-seq of stimulated PBMC, we showed that F1/V vaccination led to changes in the expression of several chemokine and cytokine genes. Genes encoding for IFN-\u03b3, IL-22, IL-17F, CSF1, CSF2, and TNFRSF4 were significantly upregulated whereas genes encoding for IL-10, TNFRSF21, CCL19, OSM, VEGFA, ILR1, MET, and LTBR were downregulated on both days 14 and 28 post-vaccination. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages and increases their ability to kill intracellular bacteria, including Yp.26 All the upregulated genes are associated with macrophage or T-cell function, which may be relevant for the control of Yp. Upregulation of IL-17F and IL-22 genes was previously seen in mice vaccinated with live attenuated strain of Yp.32 IL-17-producing T cells often produce IL-22 which acts synergistically with IL-17 to enhance the expression of anti-microbial peptides and promote inflammation.41\u201343 CSF1 and CSF2 are important for monocyte maturation and dendritic cell homeostasis.44,45 TNFRSF4 is a member of TNF receptor superfamily and provides costimulatory signals to activate T cells following TCR ligation.46 Most of the downregulated genes except LTBR, IL1R1, and CCL19 encode for ligands or receptors associated with inhibitory signals and their inhibition likely enhances the functions of antigen-presenting cells, Th1, or Th17 immunity. IL-10 is a known immunomodulator that inhibits Th1 immunity.47 NFRSF21 is an orphan TNF receptor superfamily member which belongs to a subgroup called death receptors and its knockout or downregulation enhances antibody response.48 OSM suppresses activation of IL-17 regulation in CD4 T cells.49 VEGFA is a proangiogenic factor but inhibits the differentiation and function of T cells.50 MET modulates dendritic cells to play an immunosuppressive role.51 The reasons why LTBR which is important for homeostasis of dendritic cells,52 IL1R1 which is important for IL-17 generation, and IL-1 function53 and CCL19 which enhances Th1 immunity54 are down regulated are not clear.",

In murine studies with Yp infection, F1 and V antigen help Yp avoid phagocytosis. F1 and V antigens acts in concert with plasmid encoded type III secretory system to make Yp highly resistant to phagocytosis.55,56 F1, unlike the plasmid encoded type III secretary proteins, only affects the phagocytosis of Yp without inhibiting the general phagocytic ability.55 F1 forms a capsule around the bacterium to increase its resistance to phagocytosis, presumably by preventing interactions with yet unknown phagocytic cell receptors.55,56 It is not clear why phagocytic genes are downregulated following vaccination with F1/V vaccine and this needs to be investigated further using studies that measure the function of phagocytic cells at different times post F1/V vaccination. This study has the following limitations: (1) the study did not measure the long-term immunity induced by F1/V vaccine beyond 28 days post second-vaccination, (2) gene expression markers associated with immunity induced by the flagellin adjuvanted F1/V vaccine have not been validate by qPCR because of inadequate clinical samples for additional assay, (3) the caspase 3 assay was based on a murine macrophage cell line rather than a human cell line model, and (4) recombinant Yptb used as part of the caspase-3 assay only expressed the V antigen and not the F1 antigen.",

The pretreated bacteria were added into 96-well plates containing J774 (ATCC TIB-67) macrophage cell line (1 \u00d7 103 cells per well) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the levels of caspase-3 in the culture supernatants were quantified 1.5 h later using a caspase-3 assay kit (EnzChek, Life Technologies). Caspase-3 levels were assessed as the mean of triplicate measurements. Normalization was done by dividing the mean caspase-3 values of clinical samples by caspase-3 values obtained in serum-free infected controls. Higher normalized caspase-3 values indicated lower macrophage protection and vice versa. For a more intuitive interpretation of macrophage-protective function of antibodies, the inverse of the normalized caspase-3 level variable was analyzed.",

An optimized carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based flow cytometric assay was used to measure T-cell responses in pre-vaccination and post-vaccination PBMC from volunteers who received 6 or 10 \u03bcg of flagellin-adjuvanted F1/V vaccine. The CFSE assay was performed as described previously.59 Briefly, PBMCs were stimulated with optimal antigen concentrations. On day 7, cells were stained for surface markers such as CD3, CD4, and CD8 as well as intracellular cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10. Flow-cytometric acquisition was performed by using a multi-color BD FACSCanto II instrument, and analyses were done using the CellQuest and FlowJo (Tree Star) software. A minimum of 10,000 events were acquired. Cells with decreased CFSE fluorescence were considered as proliferating cells. The absolute numbers of effector CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were calculated by multiplying the total number of viable cells recovered by the percentage of the specific T-cell subset detected by flow-cytometric analysis. Stimulation indices used for analysis were calculated by dividing the absolute number of proliferating and cytokine producing T cells for cultures stimulated with antigens by the absolute number of the corresponding T-cell population for medium-rested controls (see Supplementary Text for additional details).",

A short stimulation time (i.e., 24 h) was selected to avoid missing early gene expression changes. Stimulation for 18\u201348 h has been shown to identify transcriptomics responses associated with immune responses.60 RNA-Seq was carried out using single-end 50 base read sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq3000 sequencer. Forty-one libraries were multiplexed across four sequencing lanes with targeted coverage of 39 million reads per library. Human reference genome assembly (GRCh38), gene models, and associated gene annotation information were obtained from the ENSEMBL database (Version 90). The genomic reference was built by merging all human chromosomes except for X and Y chromosomes (to avoid gender-specific effects). Adapter sequences and low-quality 5\u2032 ending sequences were removed from raw sequencing reads using the Trimmomatic software (Version 0.36). Following adapter removal, sequence reads were aligned to the index of known human rRNAs and tRNAs using Bowtie2 with its local alignment option. Filtered reads were aligned to the reference transcriptome/genome using the latest version of HISAT2 splice-aware sequence aligner (Version 2.1.0). For each sample, the quality of reference alignments was evaluated using the RSeQC software (Version 2.6.4). Gene expression quantification was conducted on the gene level using Subread v1.5.3 counting mapped paired-reads to obtain fragment counts per gene (Supplementary Dataset 1, see Supplementary Text for additional details).",
