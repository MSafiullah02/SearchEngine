            "text": "Among the seven species of Eimeria infecting domestic chicken five species are of great economic importance due to their relatively high pathogenicity (Shirley et al. 1983). Among the five species, E. tenella is the most pathogenic species and is localized within the caecum and causes fatal caecal coccidiosis (Soulsby 2012). E. necatrix, E. acervulina and E. maxima cause intestinal coccidiosis. E. necatrix is the second most pathogenic species after E. tenella and produces a more chronic form of the disease (Soulsby 2012). E. acervulina and E. maxima are moderately pathogenic species and hence cause high morbidity but low mortality. E. acervulina, E. necatrix and E. maxima are most common species of Eimeria responsible for intestinal coccidiosis prevalent in North India (Prakshbabu et al. 2017). E. brunetti, the causative of rectal coccidiosis is highly pathogenic but has a low prevalence in India (Prakshbabu et al. 2017). In farms of South India, highly pathogenic E. necatrix was more prevalent as compared to moderately pathogenic E. acervulina (Prakshbabu et al. 2017). The variation in population dynamics of high, moderate or low pathogenic species in farms of a geographical area will region do impact the farm economics in several ways. This epidemiological factor may determine the possibility of future coccidiosis outbreaks and prophylactic measures to be undertaken. Moreover, higher incidence of high or moderately pathogenic Eimeria species in different farming systems may be indicative development of resistance against anti-coccidial chemotherapy. Hence, quantification of each individual Eimeria species present in chicken faecal droppings is necessary for understanding disease outbreaks and risk factors associated with quantitative presence of virulent species.",

An online morphometry database software based on size, morphology and texture/granularity of chicken Eimeria species named COCCIMORPH has been developed. The microphotographs of oocysts can be uploaded onto this software and the software predicts the species of oocyst based on characteristics like size and granularity. The software has been used for identification of Eimeria species in droppings of chicken collected from various farms of North India, but its efficiency in correctly identifying the species is low when compared to PCR based diagnostic methods (Kumar et al. 2014). Quantification of various Eimeria species from faecal droppings based on traditional morphometry or sporulation time would require more time and would be tedious for the technical person involved in diagnosis. Moreover the traditional techniques would be less accurate in correct identification and quantification of species.",

Thus, overall occurrence of E. maxima and E. acervulina was similar to E. necatrix (64.5%).",

            "text": "Eimeria species of domestic cannot be differentiated on the basis of morphology alone, with certainty. PCR based techniques targeting various genes or DNA fragments have been adopted for identification of different species existing in the poultry farms. Correct identification of Eimeria species in a mixed population of oocysts and their quantification in poultry litter or faecal droppings is important. Thus, use of quantitative real time PCR for quantification of the parasite genome in the DNA from mixed oocyst population is the method of choice. An attempt was made to quantify genomes of E. acervulina, E. maxima and E. necatrix in DNA sample extracted from oocysts. Quantitative PCR has been used in chicken coccidiosis primarily to monitor the development of parasitic stages in the intestine of the host (Blake et al. 2008; Kundu et al. 2017; Nolan et al. 2015). Kawahara et al. (2008) and Morgan et al. (2009) developed qPCR technique targeting ITS-1 and ITS-2 region of parasite DNA, as a tool to study molecular epidemiology. However ITS-1 and ITS-2 fragments are multiple nucleic acid regions and hence are not suitable for exact quantification of Eimeria genomes (Morgan et al. 2009). Vrba et al. (2010) used primers targeting sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) and are single copy nucleic acid fragments. Hence, primers targeting SCARs are most suitable for quantification of species. The same primers were used in this study for quantification of genomes of E. necatrix, E. maxima and E. necatrix in faecal dropping from chicken farms.",

Genome copies of E. acervulina in highest in broiler farms (23,689.076 \u00b1 8189.49) followed by backyard units (4535.66 \u00b1 2522) and layer units (1131.5 \u00b1 197.38). Similarly, quantity of E. maxima oocysts were more in broiler farms (298.54 \u00b1 207.05) as compared to layer farms (27 \u00b1 8.72) and back yard units (26.66 \u00b1 11.68). The oocyst or parasite load of E. maxima in faecal droppings of layer and back yard units were similar. Though no statistically significant differences were observed between these quantities estimated in faecal droppings of three Eimeria species in the three different farm types (Table 3), still it can be said that oocyst count of E. necatrix was highest in all the three types of farms compared to E. acervulina followed by E. maxima. Parasitic load of either E. necatrix or E. acervulina or E. maxima was highest in broiler farms as compared to backyard and layer farms. In the Indian scenario, particularly in North India layer chickens are reared in cages and have less exposure to the oocyst infection. So it is not surprising that the oocyst burden is the least for any Eimeria species recorded in layer farms in this study. Broiler chickens are reared on deep litter system with more exposure to oocysts while feeding or drinking and hence the chance of picking up infection is more. More birds are infected by the circulating oocysts which sporulate in litter after being excreted by previously infected birds. Backyard chickens are reared in a semi-intensive system, where they are on a partial free ranging system for a considerable part of the day and are housed only in the evening hours. These birds pick up oocysts shed from the infected counterparts in the flock. It may be assumed that the ground/ soil may not provide the suitable moisture and temperature conditions for oocyst sporulation compared to the litter bedding. Moreover, free ranging habits of birds area helps spread of oocysts over a large area, hence minimizing concentrations of infective oocysts within a limited area as observed in the broiler house litter. The lesser number of birds in the free range system of backyard farms results in lower stocking density and hence lower environmental oocyst burden resulting in low oocyst shedding than intensively reared broiler chicken.",

Quantitative PCR in the recent past are limited only to species identification (Kawahara et al. 2008; Morgan et al. 2009; Luu et al. 2013). However, application of quantitative PCR would have been more meaningful if the relative abundance of each species could be estimated (Morgan et al. 2009).This may be of immense importance for designing vaccination strategy, identification and proportionate evaluation of circulating vaccine and wild strains in farms or help identify the species more prone to development of anti-coccidial resistance.",
