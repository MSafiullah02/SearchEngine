In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological and genetic features of NoV outbreaks from July 2014 to June 2018 in Huzhou, China. A total of 450 stool samples collected from 51 AGE outbreaks were tested for NoVs by real-time RT PCR. Partial polymerase and capsid sequences of NoV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. NoVs were found to be responsible of 84.3% of AGE outbreaks in Huzhou over the past 5 years. Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed in recent years. At least eight genotypes were identified, and 91.9% of the genotyped outbreaks were caused by non-GII.4 strains. The top three circulating genotypes during the study period were GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12], and GII.17[P17]. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks have changed from GII.4 variants to GII.17[P17] in 2014-2015, GII.3[P12] in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018. Non-GII.4 NoVs play an increasingly important role in outbreaks in Huzhou. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of novel NoV strains and help control NoV outbreaks in the next epidemic season.",

Globally, NoVs are estimated to be associated with 50% of all-cause AGE outbreaks and 18% of sporadic cases of AGE [1, 2] . Due to their low infectious dose, prolonged asymptomatic shedding, environmental stability and substantial strain diversity, NoVs are highly infectious and can be easily transmitted from person to person [1] . Outbreaks often occur in semi-closed settings, such as cruise ships, health care settings and schools, that favor person-toperson spread [3] .",

ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins, including RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid protein VP1and minor capsid protein VP2, respectively [5] . Based on their complete VP1 amino acid sequences, NoVs can be classified genetically into ten different genogroups (GI to GX), but only GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX (formerly GII.15) are known to infect humans [6] [7] [8] . GI and GII NoVs are responsible for the majority of disease in humans, whereas GIV viruses are rarely detected. Each genogroup can be subclassified into genotypes. To date, viruses in these ten genogroups can be further divided into 49 confirmed capsid genotypes (9 GI, 27 GII, 3 GIII, 2 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI and 1 genotype each for GVII, GVIII, GIX and GX) based on amino acids of the complete VP1 and 60 confirmed P-types (14 GI, 37 GII, 2 GIII, 1 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI, 1 GVII and 1 GX) based on partial nucleotide sequences of the RdRp regions [8] .",

NoV was detected in 43 (84.3%) of the AGE outbreaks. GII NoV strains were largely predominant and responsible for 93.0% of laboratory-confirmed NoV outbreaks. Similar to other cities in the Northern Hemisphere [20] [21] [22] , NoV outbreaks in Huzhou exhibited a clear seasonality, with a peak in the cool months (November-March) and a trough in the summer months. The majority of outbreaks (88.4%, 38/43) occurred in school settings, mainly in primary schools and kindergartens. A higher percentage of NoV outbreaks among schools was also observed in other regions of China [23, 24] . From January 2014 to December 2017, a total of 616 NoV outbreaks were reported to the National Public Health Emergency Event Surveillance System (PHEESS) in China. Among these outbreaks, 93% occurred in school settings, including 39% in primary schools, 22% in childcare facilities, and 20% in secondary schools. However, this differs from the United States and Europe, where long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes) were reported as the most common settings [25] [26] [27] . In China, young students stay in crowded, enclosed classrooms (with an average of 30-50 students per classroom), where the viruses are highly transmissible by close contact between students, particularly among young students with lower levels of hand hygiene [28] . In addition, the high rate of NoV outbreaks in schools may also be due to the surveillance bias among different institutions. The Chinese Ministry of Education requires schools to screen students attending kindergarten, primary, and junior high schools every morning to check for fever, vomiting, or diarrhea [24] . Therefore, the reporting of infectious diseases including NoV outbreaks is better in these school settings.",

All of the sequenced GII NoVs belonged to the GII.4 genotype except one strain, which had a GII.b polymerase gene. From July 2014 to June 2018, NoV strains associated with the outbreaks in Huzhou exhibited important changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types as compared to previous study data. At least eight genotypes were identified during the study period, including GI. 6 [30] . In Jinan, a city in eastern China, seven genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE from 2015 to 2017, while no GII.4 was identified [31] . [32] .

After so many years since its emergence, why did GII.12-GII.3 show a dominant position in outbreaks in the 2015-2016 season? The reason for this is unknown. Further analysis using long sequences covering the complete RdRp and VP1 region are required to explore the evolutionary dynamics of GII.3[P12] strains.",

Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Compared to previous study data, differences in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks changed from GII.4 variants to GII. 17[P17] in -2015 in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018. Our findings demonstrate that non-GII.4 NoVs play an increasingly important role in the outbreaks in Huzhou. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of novel NoV strains and help control NoV outbreaks in the next epidemic season.",

GII.17 was first detected in the outbreak in November 2014 and soon became the only genotype detected in the first half of 2015. However, no outbreak of GII.17 infection occurred after May 2015, except for one outbreak caused by a mixed infection of GI.5 [P4] and GII.17 [P17] in March 2018. GII.3[P12] subsequently became the most frequently detected genotype in outbreaks between July 2015 and December 2016 (7 of 13 NoV outbreaks, 53.8%). NoV GII.2[P16] was first detected in an outbreak in February 2017, and it went on to replace GII.3[P12] as the predominant genotype from February 2017 to June 2018. With the emergence of GII.2[P16], we observed a sharp increase in the number of NoV outbreaks during February and May 2017. Compared with five outbreaks caused by GII.17 in 2014-2015, GII.2[P16] caused nine outbreaks in 2016-2017. We also compared the settings of NoV outbreaks caused by GII.17[P17], GII.3[P12], and GII.2[P16] (Table 2). Most GII.17[P17] outbreaks were reported in primary schools (80%, 4/5), whereas GII.2[P16] outbreaks occurred in all school types.

The three most common genotypes were GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12], and GII.17[P17], while the previous predominant genotype, GII.4 Sydney2012, only ranked fourth.
