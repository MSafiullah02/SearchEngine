The plasmonic peak of the colloidal gold nanoparticles changes with the aggregation of the particles due to the plasmonic interaction between nearby particles and the color of the colloidal nanoparticle solution changes from wine red to purple. Sialic acid reduced and stabilized colloidal gold nanoparticle aggregation is induced by the addition of viral particles in the solution due to the hemagglutinin-sialic acid interaction. In this work, sialic acid reduced and stabilized gold nanoparticles (d \u00bc 20.1 AE 1.8 nm) were synthesized by a simple one-pot, green method without chemically modifying sialic acid. The gold nanoparticles showed target-specific aggregation with viral particles via hemagglutinin-sialic acid binding. A linear correlation was observed between the change in optical density and dilution of chemically inactivated influenza B virus species. The detection limit of the virus dilution (hemagglutinination assay titer, 512) was shown to be 0.156 vol% and the upper limit of the linearity can be extended with the use of more sialic acid-gold nanoparticles.",

This strong interaction between metallic nanoparticles and light occurs because the oscillating electromagnetic field of light initiates the coherent oscillation of the free electrons of the metallic nanoparticles. This oscillation is termed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR results in dipole oscillation along the direction of the electric field of light (Fig. 1) . The amplitude of the oscillation reaches the maximum at certain frequency of light and it is dependent on the particle size, shape, and refractive index of the solution. For noble metallic nanoparticles, the SPR-induced strong absorption or scattering of light can be easily measured by UV-Vis absorption spectrometer.",

Gold nanoparticles typically display an SPR band at around 520 nm. The assembly or aggregation of the metallic nanoparticles usually results in a red shift of the plasmonic band. This SPR band shift can be easily observed by naked eyes with the color of the colloidal gold solution changing from red to purple to blue. Kreibig et al. showed the relationship of SPR band position and interparticle distance decades ago [3] . The interparticle distance-dependent SPR band shift is attributed to the electric dipole-dipole interactions and coupling between plasmons of the neighboring particles in the aggregates. When the interparticle distance is greater than the average particle diameter (dispersed state), the SPR band appears to be red, whereas the color turns to blue when the interparticle distance decreases to less than the average particle diameter (aggregated state).",

The spectrum becomes stabilized after several minutes, as shown in Fig. 4 . The absorbance of 0.4 nM SA-AuNPs solution was measured upon the addition of different dilutions of influenza B/Victoria. We observe that, when the virus concentration was <1.25 vol%, there was a linear correlation between the change of OD value (\u0394OD) and the amount of added virus solution, with the detection limit estimated as 0.09 vol%. The final solutions after each test illustrated the gradual change of color from red to purple as the amount of virus solution increased (photograph in Fig. 4 ) . To increase the linear range of \u0394OD vs. concentration of added virus solution, we used a higher concentration of SA-AuNP solution (0.8 nM) to conduct the similar tests, with results shown in Fig. 5a . It was observed that the linear range of \u0394OD vs. concentration of added virus solution was extended to 2.5 vol% of virus in the solution. These results illustrate the importance of using a large amount of SA-AuNPs in the solution for virus detection when applying this scheme. We note that this method can also detect another virus subtype, influenza B/Yamagata. Results obtained from the influenza B/Yamagata solutions are similar to those of influenza B/Victoria and shown in Fig. 5b .",

Experimental results support the hypothesis that sialic acid molecules on SA-AuNP surface interact with viral envelope protein hemagglutinin, causing a colorimetric change of the SA-AuNP solution. The resulting SA-AuNPs can readily detect influenza B virus (HA titer of 512) diluted to 0.156 vol%. The method is effective for different influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) .",
