The H5N1panzootic (2004 ongoing) has been one the most geographically widespread and costly, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry in 68 countries [1] and over 450 human deaths worldwide\u2014a mortality rate of 60 percent [2, 3]. For H5N1, and other H5 subtypes, most countries reporting poultry outbreaks also report evidence of the disease in wild bird populations, and the mechanisms for the spread of H5N1 have been identified as a combination of wild bird transmission and the live poultry trade [4, 5].",

Using phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates at the peak of the first H5N1 panzootic, Kilpatrick et al. identified pathways for 52 introductions in Asia, Europe, and Africa. They concluded that of 21 H5N1 introductions in Asia, 9 were due to the poultry trade and 3 were due to migrating birds; that of 23 introductions in Europe none were due to the poultry trade, and 20 were due to migratory birds; and that of 8 introductions in Africa, 2 were due to the poultry trade and 3 were due to migrating birds [4]. A later study of the same panzootic through 2006 found that except for introductions into northern and southern Vietnam, which were due to the poultry trade, all remaining introductions were best explained by wild bird migration. The authors argued that the spatial and temporal regularity of H5N1 introductions could only be explained by wild bird migration along four flyways: the East Asia flyway connecting the Far East of Russia, eastern China and Southeast Asia; the Black Sea-Mediterranean Sea flyway connecting Eastern Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nile River Valley; the East Africa-West Asia flyway connecting western/central Siberia and Central Asia and Africa; and the Central Asia flyway connecting Siberia and northern China to the southern part of North Asia and Southwest Asia [5].",

A number of studies have identified a strongly positive relationship between the opening of new markets and the introduction of a range of animal diseases, and between growing trade volumes and the probability that those diseases will establish and spread [9, 12\u201326]. In the case of H5N1, phylogenetic studies have shown significant phylogenetic clustering in Southeast Asia, consistent with the high frequency circulation among the countries of that region resulting from the growth of intra-regional trade [27, 28].",

These regions are significantly different from one another in socio-economic conditions, and particularly in the biosecurity measures applied to intra-regional trade. Using data on the 12,944 H5N1 outbreaks occurring in these regions between 2004 and 2016 (Table 1), we estimate disease risk as a function of a number of risk factors, including live poultry trade volumes and various measures of trade biosecurity.",

Our primary interest is in the role of live poultry imports as a source of trade-related avian influenza risk at the regional level. We note that other poultry products, such as packaged meat and eggs, do pose a risk, but it is significantly lower. Although avian influenza can persist in frozen meat, contact with that meat is unlikely to cause infection [30]. Furthermore, since HPAIs are lethal to egg embryos, eggs are not a potential source of transmission [31]. The data comprise an unbalanced panel covering 53 countries over 13 years; the lack of balance is due to the fact that membership of the EU changed over the timeframe.",

In 2010, for example, Indonesia recorded 1206 outbreaks while Romania, the only EU country to be infected that year, had only 2.

Some factors that influence the likelihood and number of outbreaks in a given country or region are not likely to change significantly over the course of several years, or even a decade. In our dataset, for example, the amount of land covered by wild bird habitat is time-variant, while agricultural land and even per-capita GDP for many countries experienced relatively modest variations over the timeframe of the study. In this case, and as the Hausman diagnostics indicate, a random effects estimator is more appropriate. Nevertheless, since we wished to control for time-invariant characteristics of regions and countries we also implemented fixed effects estimators at both the aggregate and trading bloc levels, implicitly assuming no changes in the trade or biosecurity environment at the bloc level that we are unable to control for.",

Across all regions we find that live poultry imports into a trade bloc are risk increasing.

The EU\u2019s common market and the ASEAN free trade regime in particular have long-standing and standardized protocols, in accordance with the World Trade Organization\u2019s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. But the two blocs have quite different exposures to external risk. A study of highly pathogenic avian influenza introductions to Vietnam, for example, found that extra-ASEAN imports of live poultry increased the risk of introduction [51]. This is also what our study finds for the ASEAN region (Table 2). We do not see an equivalent effect for the EU (Table 4), reflecting differences in both import volumes and the biosecurity measures applied to imports. The EU imports less and applies stricter biosecurity measures to those imports. The ECOWAS story is different. Extra-bloc live poultry imports are risk reducing, not risk increasing (Table 3). It is likely that imports from outside the bloc reduce avian influenza risk in the region in part because they meet biosecurity standards that are more stringent than the standards applied in the region.",

Extra-ECOWAS imports of live poultry are risk reducing while intra-bloc imports are risk increasing (Table 2).

Regulatory standards within the ECOWAS trade bloc have been weak for the whole of the study period [53].

In the EU, for example, only the prohibition of vaccination was significant, and then in positive relation to outbreaks. For poultry, vaccination may be prohibited because the practice makes it difficult to distinguish infected from vaccinated flocks. This makes it a concomitant of policies centered on livestock culling as the primary response to outbreak risk [56]. No other biosecurity policy was found to have a statistically significant relation to outbreaks in the region.",

Our results suggest that after introduction, inter-country spread had differing dynamics in each region. While intra-bloc trade facilitated H5N1 spread among West African countries, it did not in either Europe or Southeast Asia. In these areas, greater risk was posed by out-of-region live poultry imports.",

In particular, HPAI H5N1, which was first isolated in 1996, has been the most widespread and among the most devastating in terms of livestock and human mortality. It has inflicted severe losses to poultry stocks and caused hundreds of human deaths. Even today, as other avian influenzas have become epidemic, H5N1 remains in circulation among wildlife and livestock. Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms of its international spread can help lay the groundwork for prediction and mitigation. It may also provide an instructive framework for the management of other avian influenzas.",

Differing agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions across the trade regions were shown to influence epidemic dynamics in different ways, with certain factors being risk-enhancing or risk-decreasing in one region but having the opposite effect, or no significant effect, in another. In policy terms, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to mitigating avian influenza spread. The particular conditions, including those related to the trade agreements and associated regulatory standards, of a given region need to be carefully considered. But overall, biosecurity measures are potentially effective at controlling H5N1 risks, and should be undertaken as a means to forestall spread\u2013in general, mitigation of epidemics is significantly more cost-efficient than suppression [57]. On-farm and other forms of domestic biosecurity may be more important than trade-related measures, but where the protection of trade pathways is weak, the risk of avian influenza spread is clearly higher.",
