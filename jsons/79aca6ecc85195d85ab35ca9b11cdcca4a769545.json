From January 2011 to December 2017, we retrospectively compared the outcome of allo-HSCT recipients diagnosed of CARVs LRTD mono-infection (n = 52, group 1), to those with viral, bacterial, or fungal pulmonary CARVs LRTD coinfections (n = 15, group 2; n = 20, group 3, and n = 11, group 4, respectively), and with those having bacterial pneumonia mono-infection (n = 19, group 5). Overall survival (OS) at day 60 after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher in group 1, 2, and 4 compared to group 3 (77%, 67%, and 73% vs 35%, respectively, P = .012). Recipients of group 5 showed a trend to better OS compared to those of group 3 (62% vs 35%, P = .1). Multivariate analyses showed bacterial co-infection as a RF for mortality (hazard ratio[HR] 2.65, 95% C.I. 1.2-6.9, P = .017). We identified other 3 RFs for mortality: lymphocyte count <0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L (HR 2.6, 95% 1.1-6.2, P = .026), the occurrence of and CMV DNAemia requiring antiviral therapy (CMV-DNAemia-RAT) at the time of BAL (HR 2.32, 95% C.I. 1.1-4.9, P = .03), and the need of oxygen support (HR 8.3, 95% C.I. 2.9-35.3, P = .004). CARV LRTD co-infections are frequent and may have a negative effect in the outcome, in particular in the context of bacterial co-infections.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Recently, the introduction in daily clinical practice of more sophisticated diagnostic tools based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), such as those testing for CARVs and other pathogens, has permitted to expand microbiological findings in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of allo-HSCT recipients harboring lower respiratory tract (LRT) complications. This fact has likely increased the ability to diagnose infectious pneumonia and probably has led to the identification of a high number of cases with co-pathogens as compared to conventional microbiological studies (ie, viral culture or antigen testing only available for some CARVs). Currently, there is a lack of studies analyzing in detail the incidence, character- To this purpose, this study analyzes the clinical implications of co-infections (viral, fungal, and bacterial CARVs LRTD coinfections) detected in BAL samples in a cohort of allo-HSCT recipients with a first-proven CARVs LRTD episode and compared the outcome to mono-infections (CARV and bacterial LRT monoinfections). Additionally, we analyzed risk factors (RFs) and the value of the immunodeficiency score index (ISI) 11 to predict morbidity and mortality in allo-HSCT recipients with CARVs LRTD in the RT-PCR era.

Interestingly, we observed a trend to poorer outcome of recipients with CARVs LRTD and bacterial co-infections compared to those with bacterial pneumonia mono-infection. These findings suggest that the negative effect of bacterial co-infection does not seem to be independently explained by the predominant influence of the bacterial agent but rather by the co-infection status.

This fact suggests that validation of the ISI in other CARVs is warranted before its routine application for therapeutic decision-making. Regarding the Basel Immunodefciency grading score, the fact that we did not include immunoglobulin levelsin the score may have hampered our ability to assess its true value and further validation would be required. 12, 13 Regarding the analysis of RFs for co-infections during CARVs LRTD our decision of limiting this analysis to bacterial co-infection was justified by 3 main reasons. First, our study showed that bac- of CARV LRTD co-infection. 38 We acknowledge that our study has some limitations including the relatively low number of patients, the use of 2 different multiplex PCR platforms for CARV, the inclusion of several CARV types, as well as its retrospective nature. In addition, when multiple viruses were detected we were not able to differentiate be- ",

To elucidate this issue, clinical outcome comparisons between CARVs LRTD co-infection, CARVs LRTD mono-infection and other mono-infections (ie, bacterial pneumonia mono-infection) are suitable to better establish the putative effect of each microbiological co-pathogen in the outcome.",

Second, there is an increased evidence in the mechanism whereby viral infections enhance and aggravate bacterial co-infection, the former favoring the growth of bacterial agents by multiple factors, including local destruction of antibacterial barriers at epithelial surfaces, suppression of antibacterial immunity, and induction of apoptosis in immune cells. 10,33-35 Third, RFs for respiratory virus co-infection are expected to be different from those affecting bacterial co-infection since respiratory virus transmission depend upon epidemiologic situation such as the recipients house-hold contacts, contact with children, vaccination status, which has not been captured in our data base. Thus, we identified 2 conditions related with higher incidence of bacterial co-infection; corticosteroids \u22651 mg/kg/d, and CMV DNAemia-RAT. While corticosteroids are a well-recognized RF of profound immunosuppression and then may contribute to bacterial infection in allo-HSCT, this is the first time that CMV DNAemia-RAT was identified as a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia co-infection during CARVs LRTD. CMV is a highly pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive virus 36 and as such it may act synergistically with respiratory virus favoring bacterial growth in the respiratory tract. In addition, CMV readily infects macrophages in vivo, impairing their ability to recognize and eliminate bacteria by phagocytosis. 37 Another contributing factor for such observation could be the development of neutropenia-related anti-CMV therapy. Further studies are warranted to confirm such findings since the use of antibiotics in allo-HSCT recipients with CARVs at risk of progression to the LRT with concurrent CMV DNAemia-RAT and/or under corticosteroids therapy may be clinically useful to prevent bacterial pneumonia. Last but not least, we reported that fungal co-infection did not show a negative effect on survival in our cohort. It is likely that the introduction of effective anti-mold drugs from 2007 has overcome the F I G U R E 2 Probability of mortality at day 60 after of bronchoalveolar lavage according to the absence or presence of risk factors (CMV DNAemia requiring antiviral therapy, lymphopenia <0.5 \u00d7 109/L and/or oxygen support).

To overcome this limitation, we critically reviewed the radiological patterns at the time of BAL as well as the presence of upper and lower respiratory symptoms ensuring a high degree of CARVs-related cases. Moreover, all BAL samples were homogenously and prospectively tested for CARVs, fungal, and bacterial agents, avoiding the inclusion of cases with PCR retrospectively tested in frozen BAL samples, and this fact should be considered as strength. Regarding the inclusion of several types of CARVs LRTD, that may differ in their pathogenicity, several comparative studies analyzing mortality among different CARVs LRTD showed similar mortality rates 7,8,39 and could justify our pooled cohort analysis for mortality. In fact, we did not observe significant differences on mortality among the different respiratory viruses in our series, either with or without co-infections. In addition, our data shows an overall mortality rate (35%) comparable among CARVs and in line with several reports, 1-8,39 emphasizing that any CARVs LRTD are still a common life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. In conclusion, CARV LRTD co-infections are frequent and may have a negative effect in the outcome, in particular in the context of bacterial co-infections. Our risk score based on easily identifiable RFs (lymphopenia <0.5 \u00d7 109/L, oxygen requirement, and CMV DNAemia-RAT) merit further validation in other cohorts whereas the ISI and the Basel immunodeficiency grading require further validation in prospective studies.",
