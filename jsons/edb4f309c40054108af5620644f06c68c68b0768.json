Understanding the behavior of residents during epidemic benefits emergency management when one tries to design intervention strategies and resilience measures. From the perspective of movements, the widely used Bike Sharing System (BSS) in China is capable of characterizing the behavior patterns over time & space within big cities. Although share bikes are playing an important role as data sources in data mining, they could be of help but are rarely reported in pandemic-related researches. Based on the share bike records in Beijing, we constructed a behavior pattern analysis framework, then analyzed the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of residents, figured out the key time nodes of different pandemic periods, and demonstrated the variations in mobility due to the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions. The impact of the pandemic was assessed by performing co-location analysis between share bike usage and POIs (Point Of Interest). Classification of POIs is helpful to distinguish the behavior patterns generated by various productive and social activities. Discussions with evolving confirmed COVID-19 cases suggest the effectiveness and necessity of the public interventions in the COVID-19 containment during the resilience period. These findings provide critical information on how to respond to the current COVID-19 outbreak and other epidemic events.",

Moreover, due to limited emerging understanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanism, revealing its impacts on public behavior remains challenging. As far as we know, there is no study on the impact of social events and/or emergencies based on the 3rd generation BSS.",

As preconditioning, a comparison between the same period of 2019 and 2020 was conducted to remove the effect of the Chinese New Year holiday. Identification of the key time nodes in different pandemic periods was conducted by segmenting the whole time series while keeping the maximal similarity inside the segments. In different pandemic periods, we implemented a co-location analysis between the usage patterns and different types of POIs, which reveals the public reactions and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we analyzed the relevance between the change of behavior patterns and the progress of confirmed cases, and assess the effectiveness of suppression strategies. The main novelty of our proposed work is to depict public responses to the progress of COVID-19 from spatiotemporal perspective by interpreting the behavior patterns of residents extracted from long time-sequenced share bike records. Therefore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of suppression strategy could be analyzed on a citywide scale, providing references in more detail for policy-making and epidemiology research.",

This feature suggests that the movement of bikes is purely done by users. All analysis we perform is statistically aggregated, removing the ability to characterize the behavior of any single device.

Consequently, to assess the spatial distribution of share bike usage near various categories of POIs, buffer zones centered on each POI, with a range of 200 meters, were established to accumulate the share bike usage that fell in the area. We then computed the average share bike usage in these phases respectively. Results are reported in Table 4 . In the table, a, b and c stand for share bike usage during phase a, b, and c for simplicity. Beside them, two ratios are used to measure the extent to which the COVID-19 epidemic has led to the decline in various activities. Ratio b/a describes the decline in share bike usage during the quarantine period, and the recovery status can be inferred from ratio c/a when the pandemic mitigated. in a to 36.3 in b) and proportion (18.1%), one possible explanation is they suit best \"work from home\". During this period, the intensive intracity public traffic (e.g., buses) was limited to avoid contact infection, and share bikes became feasible vehicles to fulfill short-term travel demand under this situation. This ratio of the subway station (25.5%) and supermarket & grocery (24.9%) are higher than in other categories. One possible reason for this phenomenon is the need for the residents to procure essential goods, though outdoor activities were voluntarily reduced during the quarantine.",

The shopping plazas yields the lowest increase rate at 1.6%, which could be attributed to distancing restrictions for personnel dense places. Partial resumption of work leads to a slight increase in the daily average share bike usage near two company categories, with 41.1 for tech companies and 39.4 for other companies. Ratio c/a being 20.5% and 24.2% suggest there is still a while from full recovery.

Confirmed cases in each district are displayed by blue circles, where the cumulative number of cases is shown by the size of circles. When comparing the panels from left to right with the date varying from 25 Jan to 08 Feb, we observe that the aggregated share bike intensity gradually decreases with an increasing number of confirmed cases and then remains at a low level. The aggregated share bike intensity in the downtown area changed from red to green. Starting on January 25, 2020, highly restrictive measures were implemented by local government: individuals were asked to follow a series of social distancing measures. As a result, the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases was effectively suppressed.

After removing the factor of the Chinese New Year holiday, our results suggest that social and productive activities of residents were hugely affected by the COVID-19, reflected in the drastic decrease of share bike usage (down to less than 40% of that of the same period in 2019). It can be figured out that the cumulative confirmed cases stayed stable substantially after the restarting of productive activities, implying the ongoing control measures were necessary and effective in the containment of the spread of COVID-19 when opening-up. Co-location analysis shows the infected RAs situated in the city center are most impacted, even after the pandemic is mitigated; Among POIs, share bike usage of tech companies has the biggest change before and during the pandemic as these companies are most suitable for \"work from home\", etc. These findings provide supplementary details to the public reactions during the pandemic. As the situation develops globally, our results could be references to epidemiological researches and inform policymaking in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, and help to prevent the emergence of pandemics in the future.
