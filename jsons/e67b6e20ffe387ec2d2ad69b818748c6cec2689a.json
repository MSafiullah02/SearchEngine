The segmented genome of influenza A virus genome allows for the exchange of entire gene segments in the event that two different influenza A viruses simultaneously infect and replicate in the same host cell. 4 Antigenic shift is caused by reassortment of two different subtypes of influenza virus (such as between an animal and a human subtype), which causes a phenotypic change. Antigenic shift only occurs in influenza A virus as it infects more than just humans. Antigenic shifts can result in epidemics and pandemics.

It forms either an \u03b1-2,3 or \u03b1-2,6 linkage, and it is this configuration that is recognized by the HA protein. 10 The \u03b1-2,3 linkage is the major sialic acid found in the gastrointestinal tract of the duck. In contrast, the major sialic acid found in upper respiratory epithelial cells in humans contains the \u03b1-2,6 linkage. It is for this reason that not all avian strains can easily infect humans. For example, in order for avian influenza (H5N1) to infect humans, it must penetrate deep into the alveoli where there are more \u03b1-2,3 receptors. 11 Once the virus attaches to the host cell, it enters the cell through receptormediated endocytosis. The envelope fuses with the host cell, and M2 proteins (a target for amantadine) form ion channels, allowing entry of ribonucleoproteins necessary for viral uncoating and replication. 10 Initial response to infection is characterized by proinflammatory state. Th1 cells are activated and release proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and interleukin (IL)-2. 12, 13 The secondary phase of infection is characterized by the anti-inflammatory state. It is in this state that activated Th2 cells secrete cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. 12, 14 It is this state of depressed immune activation that leads to secondary infections such as bacterial coinfections and CMV reactivation. 15 The influenza virus has developed its own host of mechanisms to counteract the activity of major antiviral cytokines such as INF\u03b3. Influenza proteins such as NS-1, which antagonize and inhibit the actions of IFN, PBF-F2 proteins that inhibit IFN induction, viral polymerase that inhibits IFN function, and M2 protein prevents TLR induction. 16 Viral infections can trigger the dysregulation of the immune system by inducing a massive cytokine response. This cytokine storm can cause endothelial damage and dysfunction, deregulation of coagulation, and, consequently, alteration of microvascular permeability, tissue edema, and shock. 17 In severe influenza, this vascular hyperpermeability can lead to acute lung injury, multiorgan failure, and encephalopathy. 16 Different strains of influenza elicit different immune responses. It has been suggested that H5N1 may cause a higher viral load and hypercytokinemia. 18, 19 It has also been shown that H5N1 viral replication is not confined to the respiratory tract but also occurs in the intestine. 20", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 127, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 308, "end": 310, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 740, "end": 742, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1028, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1254, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1257, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1430, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1433, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1572, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1916, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2209, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2336, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2490, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2493, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza: Pathophysiology"}, {"text": "Influenza is an acute respiratory disease characterized in its full form by the sudden onset of respiratory and systemic symptoms, with high fever as a characteristic feature. 21 While influenza A and B are the most common causes of this influenzalike illness (ILI), other pathogens such as influenza C, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae can also cause it. 21 Different strains have been found to elicit different clinical features.

The results from this meta-analysis suggest that convalescent plasma may have an impact on reducing mortality and viral load in patients with severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology. 44 There have been case reports of a rapid reduction in detectable viral load in patients with influenza A (H5N1) treated with convalescent plasma without significant serious events.

Symptoms related to myocarditis, such as chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope, may have been the cause of presentation to hospital in the first instance. 59 The clinical manifestations range from subclinical myocarditis to sudden death, new-onset atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, complete heart block, heart failure, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and acute myocardial infection (AMI)-like syndromes. 58, 60 The most common complication is congestive heart failure diagnosed by global hypokinesis on echo/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which has been reported in 84% (37/44) of patients with influenza-associated myocarditis. The majority (70%; 26/37) of those who had myocarditis-related reduced ejection fraction (ranging from 8 to 50%) experienced resolution of their systolic function, typically within 20 days of the onset of dysfunction. 60 Many patients who develop influenza-related myocarditis require advanced cardiac support therapies such as intraaortic balloon pumps and ECMO.

This was a prospective observational study of adult patients admitted to ICU with microbiologically confirmed influenza A during the 2009 influenza season in Spain. The study included 657 patients. In the entire patient population, there was a nonsignificant difference in ICU mortality in patients who received early treatment (EL) versus late treatment (LT) (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 0.96-2.21). 40 A further subgroup analysis looked at the 404 patients who required MV. Of these, 385 patients received effective antiviral therapy. ET was initiated in 20.5% of patients (n \u00bc 79), whereas LT was initiated in 79.5% of patients (n \u00bc 306). LT compared with ET was associated with increased ICU LOS (22.7 AE 16.7 vs. 18.4 AE 14.2 days; p \u00bc 0.03), hospital LOS (34.0 AE 20.3 vs. 27.2 AE 18.2 days; p \u00bc 0.001), and MV days (17.4 AE 15.2 vs. 14.0 AE 12.4; p \u00bc 0.04). ICU mortality was also higher with LT (34.3%) than with ET (21.5%; OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.06-3.41). These findings suggest that early oseltamivir administration was associated with improved outcomes in ventilated patients during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 40 A study by Lytras et al examined the effect of early oseltamivir treatment on mortality in critically ill patients infected with influenza A/H1N1, A/H2N3, and influenza B over eight seasons from 2010 to 2011 and from 2017 to 2018. This was a cohort study including 1,330 patients, of whom 622 (46.8%) died in the ICU. Among patients with influenza A/H3N2, there was a reduction in mortality observed in the ET group compared with the LT group (33.7 vs. 48.4% respectively; p \u00bc 0.029).
