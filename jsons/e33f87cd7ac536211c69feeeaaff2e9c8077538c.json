Of the survivors of rabbit coronavirus infection, 41% had increased heart weight and heart weight-tobody weight ratios, biventricular dilation, myocyte hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and myocarditis consistent with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. These changes were also seen in the remaining 59% of the survivors, except that the degree of myocyte hypertrophy was reduced and only right ventricular dilation was present. In most survivors, myocarditis was usually mild (1-5 foci/transverse section), but in some cases it was severe (>20 foci/transverse section). Interstitial and replacement fibrosis was more pronounced in the papillary muscles. These data suggest that rabbit coronavirus infection may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Infection may result in degeneration and necrosis of myocytes, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and CHF [21, 23] . Viral infection has long been suspected as an important initiating event in the development of DCM [24] [25] [26] . Direct viral involvement in both myocarditis and DCM, however, has been difficult to prove, because recovery of infectious virus has rarely been successful [26] . In addition, the mechanisms by which viruses induce myocarditis and DCM remain highly controversial, and more animal models are needed to provide insight into this phenomenon [27] . Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that RbCV infection is divided on the basis of death and pathologic findings into acute and subacute phases. During the subacute phase, myocarditis is evident and animals are probably dying ofheart failure [17, 18] . The etiologic agent for this disease is an enveloped RNA virus, originally designated the Stockholm agent. This virus is antigenically and morphologically related to group I human coronaviruses [18] . RbCV is also related to pleural effusion disease virus, which produces a similar disease in rabbits [18, [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

Survivors of RbCV infection were divided into two groups.

In addition to myocyte hypertrophy, the principal difference between the two groups was the presence ofbiventricular dilation in the moderate group.

Scattered foci of both interstitial and replacement fibrosis were present throughout the heart. Fibrosis usually was mild and most evident in the papillary muscles of both the right and left ventricles. Direct viral cytotoxicity ofthe myocytes and myocarditis has probably resulted in much of the fibrosis seen in the hearts. In addition, since papillary muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in myocardial oxygenation, these data suggest that inadequate cardiac output due to impaired ventricular function has probably resulted in poor oxygenation of these tissues, resulting in fibrosis [39] .",

Small scattered foci of lymphocytic myocarditis, as defined by the Dallas classification system [49] , were seen in all survivors ofRbCV infection. The degree of myocarditis varied from slight to severe (1 to >20 foci/transverse section), which persisted through III days after infection. Most of the animals had scattered, small foci (1-5/transverse section) oflymphocytes that would have been difficult to detect by myocardial biopsy. In both the encephalomyocarditis virus and coxsackievirus B mouse models, mononuclear cellular infiltration of the heart was still evident 30 days after infection [14, 15] .

Alternatively, autoimmune mechanisms may explain the persistence of myocarditis. The difficulty in finding infectious virus in humans with DCM or in other animal models suggests that viral persistence or autoimmunity may play a significant role in chronic myocarditis in DCM [27] .
