            "text": "The cellular life cycle of viruses is tightly connected with lipid membranes. During viral entry, membranes have to be crossed, and within the cell, the viral life depends on subcellular membranes, since viruses build their proteins along lipid membranes. They also use the principle of compartmentalizing for optimized replication and therefore deform subcellular membranes. Another strategy is to capitalize on electrochemical and substrate gradients formed across membranes. For the use of these gradients in the most sensible way, channel-forming proteins are encoded in the genome of the virus. Channel-forming proteins are active at almost every stage of the viral replication. They are involved during the entry phase of the virus into the host and also within the infected cell. While the roles of some channels are well identified, for others this role still has to be elucidated. The assumption that similar tasks on a molecular level can only be accomplished by the same type of molecule in almost the same conformational and spatial arrangements inspires this review on the mechanism of function of viral channels in comparison with host channels.",

One simply cannot stop wondering how mechanics can be achieved in an environment in which we have to leave the concepts of movements in viscous media and can only rely on electrostatic and quantum mechanical principles to get a glimpse of what is happening. Learning more about the time domain of the mechanics is highly desirable as well. Maybe we can understand the biological \u201cnanomachines\u201d and design new ones, which are \u201clonger lasting,\u201d capable of handling bigger loads, and show other improved characteristics. Since the viral channel-forming proteins are smaller than their host companions, their architecture depicts miniature design in an already miniaturized world, or going down-scale in an already down-scaled world.",

If we know the function of an enzyme, which cleaves a specific substrate, we can design a substrate which cannot be cleaved but rather jammed into the active site of the enzyme. If we know the conformation transition the molecule undergoes, we are able to generate more potent drugs. Dealing with other proteins than enzymes, such as the channel proteins mentioned here, the site of drug action is not so easy to elucidate. In principle, we \u201csee\u201d the protein but do not know where to go with our drug molecule. Consequently, an active site may be one of the many conformations the protein adopts during its \u201cworking cycle.\u201d From this particular perspective, one has to explore the entire conformational space of the protein as a prerequisite for improved drug development. Crystal structures serve as an important starting point for computational drug development representing \u201cfrozen\u201d conformations. Computational modeling is able to screen and visualize more conformational space and in this respect possibly \u201clink\u201d individual crystal structures.",

Therefore, the architecture of those channels, which are anticipated to have a relation to the viral channels, is introduced. The relation is driven by sequence alignment of viral channel forming proteins (VCPs) with those of host proteins (Fischer and Hsu, 2011). Identifying related host proteins, specifically gating mechanics are elucidated and cross-related to the viral channels. In general, there are several mechanical movements especially within the lipid membrane known for ion channels, such as moderate conformational changes (Cymes and Grosman, 2008, Miyazawa et al., 2003; and references therein) and sliding of helices (Chang et al., 1998, Kuo et al., 2003). Openings of pores designed by toxins seem to be made irreversibly by assembly (Mueller et al., 2009). Finally, the idea of \u201cdrug hunting\u201d is outlined in respect to small molecule drugs and peptide drugs.",

On the seventh segment, which encodes the matrix protein M1, a second overlapping reading frame has been identified coding a protein of about 11 kDa called M2 (Allen et al., 1980, Lamb and Choppin, 1981, Lamb and Lai, 1981, Winter and Fields, 1980) (Fig. 6.1A). Its topology is found to be monotopic comprising an N terminal side on the extracellular side marking it a type III integral membrane protein present at the plasmamembrane of infected cells (Lamb et al., 1985). The amino acid distribution indicates about 18\u201323 amino acids on the extramembrane side, 19 amino acids membrane spanning, and 54 amino acids toward the C terminus (Zebedee and Lamb, 1988). It is also present in the virion with about 14\u201368 molecules (Zebedee and Lamb, 1988). M2 assembles into cystein\u2010linked homodimers which noncovalently associate into homotetramers (Holsinger and Lamb, 1991, Sugrue and Hay, 1991). Some of the M2 proteins of various subtypes have been identified to be palmitylated at Cys-50 (Sugrue et al., 1990). Amantadine resistance mutant studies of influenza viruses correlated resistance to mutations in the seventh segment, especially to the TMD of M2 (Hay et al., 1985). Mapping the mutations on a helical wheel reveals that the mutations are along one side of the helical structure. The mapping supports the idea that the protein assembles around a kind of central axis which is relevant for its functioning as a proton channel (Sugrue and Hay, 1991).",

Also, whole-cell recordings of M2 and mutant M2 expressed in Xenopus laevis show that M2 activity is enabled by low pH and that amantadine is interacting with the channel (Wang et al., 1993). Channel activity has also been demonstrated in mammalian cells (Wang et al., 1994) and vesicle\u2010based fluorescence essays (Schroeder et al., 1994), with the latter technique confirming proton conductance (Lin and Schroeder, 2001). Reconstitution of the protein into artificial bilayers also reveals channel activity of M2 (Tosteson et al., 1994). Electrophysiological experiments with M2 in mouse erythroleukemia cells have been conducted on ion selectivity confirming that M2 is 107 times more selective for protons than for monovalent cations (Chizhmakov et al., 1996). Whole-cell recordings with M2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes reveal a very low conductance of about 1\u201310 fA, which allows about 104 protons per second to pass (Mould et al., 2000). These measurements are flanked by results from studies with X. laevis (Shimbo et al., 1996). Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique on X. leavis, first evidence is given that the protonation state of the one histidine within the TMD is important for conductance (Wang et al., 1995). Proton conductance of full-length M2 expressed in BL21 cells and reconstituted into liposomes has also been shown to be independent on the presence of electrolytes (Vijayvergiya et al., 2004).",

By adding data from functional studies like Cys scanning and electrophysiological measurements as mentioned (Pinto et al., 1997) as well as computational modeling data (Sansom and Kerr, 1993, Sansom et al., 1997, Zhong et al., 1998), an approximate structural model of the tetrameric assembly of the TMDs of M2 with the histidines and tryptophans as important pore lining residues has been generated. In a combined study using FTIR spectroscopy with site-specific labeled amino acids and a dynamic molecular global search protocol, further strong support for the tetrameric model has been achieved (Kukol et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Studies based on tryptophan fluorescence on fully expressed M2 and mutants reveal that Trp-41 and His-37 work in concert upon low pH activation (Czabotar et al., 2004). Together with other experimental (Pinto et al., 1997, Wang et al., 1995) and computational studies (Sansom et al., 1997, Schweighofer and Pohorille, 2000), it is proposed that several mechanisms of function shuttle the proton across a selective and narrow part around the histidines of the channel. In one mechanism, called \u201cshuttle\u201d mechanism, the incoming proton is taken up by His-37 on its \u03b4-nitrogen which induces a release of the hydrogen on the \u03b5-nitrogen. Via a tautomerization, the sidechain of His-37 is reloaded. In another mechanism, the \u201cwater-wire\u201d mechanism, the protonated histidines will repel each other allowing for an opening and transport via a hydrogen wire. Computational modeling combining classical molecular dynamics simulations with multistate empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) approach (Schmitt and Voth, 1998) has shown that a hydronium ion will not move through the histidine ring. It is rather anticipated that the proton could shuttle even if the histidines are not fully removed to generate a kind of \u201copen\u201d channel (Smondyrev and Voth, 2002). The consequence of this study is that not all of the histidines need to be protonated and consequently charged to generate an \u201copen\u201d channel. Solid state NMR spectroscopic investigations have shown that at high pH, the channel can exist in a closed state when a neighboring pair of the histidines share a proton, and consequently, a third one releases this pairing and opens for a putative water-wire to conduct the proton (Hu et al., 2006). With the detection of conformational distinct tryptophans upon low and high pH conditions by 19F NMR spectroscopy, a contribution of Trp-41 during channel gating has been verified (Winter et al., 2008). Finally, to date a cooperative gating model is proposed in which upon low pH on the N terminal side one histidine gets trapped via a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the tryptophan while the other histidine is able to offer one of its protons to the water on the C terminal side (Sharma et al., 2010).",

All structures reveal a left-handed bundle. For the NMR investigations, a TMD M2 construct with an amphiphatic helix at the C terminal side has been used to stabilize the helix bundle which otherwise could not have been investigated (Schnell and Chou, 2008). The expressed M2 construct is reconstituted into DHPC detergent micelles and due to solution NMR spectroscopic investigations at high pH (pH 7.5). The construct is recorded in the presence of the antiviral drug rimantadine which interacts with the helix bundle at the lipid protein interface. The bundle forms a narrow pore which has a wider pocket of about 0.6 nm around Gly-34 and is highly restricted around His-37 and Trp-41. The structure is referred to as a potential closed form of the channel (Pielak and Chou, 2010). Solely, the TMD of M2 has been crystallized and its structure resolved to 0.2 nm in octyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (OG) detergents at high pH (pH 7.3) (Stouffer et al., 2008). The pore is opened into a tepee\u2010like shape with its restriction on the N terminal side and the Trp-41 apart from each other. A mutant M2 (Gly-34 is replaced by alanine) cocrystallized with amantadine at lower pH (pH 5.3) identifies a structure which is similar in shape as the one crystallized at pH 7.3. The binding site of amantadine is marked to be within the lumen of the pore. The shape of the bundle is considered to represent an open form of the channel. Solution NMR studies reveal that at low pH the TMDs are dynamic (Hu et al., 2011, Li et al., 2007, Pielak et al., 2009). It is a common theme of all models that, besides the His-X-X-X-Trp motif, Asp-44 and Arg-45 play an additional role in the gating mechanism.",

            "text": "Similar to influenza A, segment 7 of the influenza B genome also harbors two proteins M1 and M2 with the latter to be a proton channel called BM2 (Briedis et al., 1982) of about 15 kDa (109 amino acids) (Horvath et al., 1990). The sequence of BM2 is highly conserved which indicates its importance for the virus (Hiebert et al., 1986). The protein is phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm but also transported to the plasma membrane where it is incorporated into virions (Odagiri et al., 1999). Like M2, BM2 is a type III integral membrane protein with an H-X-X-X-W motif but with no further sequence homology with M2 including cysteins in the ectodomain (Paterson et al., 2003). Its role is suggested to equilibrate the pH gradient between the Golgi and the cytoplasm by forming proton channels (Mould et al., 2003). Proton conductance of BM2 is found to be higher than for M2. Mutation studies identify polar serine residues (serines 9, 12, and 16) facing the lumen of the pore which is discussed as an explanation for the resistance of BM2 against amantadine (Ma et al., 2008, Paterson et al., 2003). The oligomerization state is experimentally confirmed to be a tetramer together with functional studies using the two electrode voltage clamp method (Balannik et al., 2008). Despite functional similarity with M2 protein, BM2 cannot form oligomers with M2. Not forming a tetramer via the \u201cdimer of a dimer\u201d concept, the route of assembly seems to follow the same as for other VCPs such as Vpu, p7, or 2B.",

The \u201cfull-length\u201d structural model is derived from experimental results of two overlapping constructs: a TMD containing construct BM21\u201333 (2KIX) and a cytoplasmic domain containing construct BM226\u2013109 (2KJ1). With its large cytoplasmic domain which generates a large dipole moment, it is suggested that BM2 is also involved in the recruitment of matrix proteins at the cell surface and in combination with that involved in the viral assembly and budding process. The channel domain consists of two heptad repeats Leu-8 to Ile-14 and Leu-15 to Ile-21, and the data confirm serines 9, 12, and 16 as pore lining. Ser-12 completely faces the pore while the other two are also involved in interhelix packing. The pore is occluded by a ring of four Phe-5 and Trp-23. Interesting to note is that mutations of Ser-12 and Ser-16 into alanines affect proton conductance much more than mutations of His-19 and His-27 into alanine (Wang et al., 2009b). Computational modes of the TMDs of BM2 have been modeled using coarse\u2010grained simulation techniques in combination with united atom simulations (Rouse et al., 2009). The suggestion in this study is that, also in this channel, a minimum of three histidines need to be protonated to induce conformational changes which lead to an open conformation.",

            "text": "CD4 degradation is found to be due to the interaction of a short sequence, KRLLSEKKT, in the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 with a helical domain of the cytoplasmic part of Vpu (Tiganos et al., 1997). Also, residues at the linker region between the TMD and cytoplasmic domain of Vpu contribute to CD4 degradation (Tiganos et al., 1998). For CD4 downregulation, the two phosphorylation sites of Vpu, Ser-52 and Ser-56, are identified to be essential (Paul and Jabbar, 1997, Schubert et al., 1994). Downregulation via interaction with Vpu has also been reported for \u03b2TrCP (Margottin et al., 1996) to hand over CD4 to the proteosomal degradation pathway. Also, other host proteins such as Vpu binding protein (UBP) (Callahan et al., 1998), CD74 (Hussain et al., 2008), and CD317 (Bolduan et al., 2011, Neil et al., 2008, van Damme et al., 2008) are \u201cmarked\u201d by Vpu for downregulation. Interaction of Vpu with host factors at the site of the plasmamembrane are reported for TASK channels (Hsu et al., 2004) and BST-2/tetherin (also called CD317) (Neil et al., 2008, van Damme et al., 2008). In both host proteins, the TMD of Vpu is responsible for the interaction (Hsu et al., 2004, Skasko et al., 2011). For BST-2, it has been shown that Vpu slows down BST-2 transport to the plasma membrane (Dub\u00e9 et al., 2010) and that the Vpu-BST-2 complex is retained in the ER (Skasko et al., 2011). The interaction is reported to be due to the TMDs of both proteins. BST-2 itself is known to form a dimer and crystallographic data identify for the extramembrane part an elongated helical motif which forms a coiled-coil toward the C terminal side and a flexible region able to assemble into a tetramer on the N terminal side (Hinz et al., 2010, Schubert et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The loop sequence, EYRKLL, connecting the TMD of Vpu with its cytoplasmic domain has been shown to be responsible of transporting Vpu to the plasma membrane (Ruiz et al., 2008). At the site of the plasma membrane, it is anticipated that Vpu forms channels via oligomerization. Expression of Vpu in amphibian oocytes induces conductance of cations measured under voltage clamp conditions (Coady et al., 1998, Schubert et al., 1996b) which shows marginal effect on divalent ions such as Ba2 + and Ca2 +. Together with peptides representing the TMD and a scrambled sequence, it has been shown that solely the TMD exhibits cation specific channel activity. A series of experiments has been performed which show that expressed Vpu in E. coli purified and reconstituted into artificial bilayers exhibit channel activity (Ewart et al., 1996, Mehnert et al., 2007). Recordings solely with the TMD of Vpu reveal similar conductivity compared to full-length protein with minimal changes in the kinetics (Ma et al., 2002, Mehnert et al., 2007). Replacing Trp-23 by Leu in a synthetic peptide construct, Vpu132, reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers, alters the open time duration and shut kinetics of the peptide, while a change of Ser-24 to Leu abolishes channel activity completely (Mehnert et al., 2008). No affect has been reported when Arg-31 is exchanged into Val. Channel recordings of the TMD of Vpu in solutions of different ions reveal that the Vpu channels which are only slightly selective indicate almost pore\u2010like characteristics. It has been suggested that Vpu shows a channel-pore dualism (Mehnert et al., 2008) which means that Vpu can either act as a more or less selective channel or non-selective pore depending on specific in vivo conditions. These conditions could possibly be due to changes in lipid environment. In a recent electrophysiological study, using whole-cell clamp conditions with 293T cells expressing full-length Vpu mutant S24A does also not exhibit channel activity (Bolduan et al., 2011).",

Since TASK channel activity in HeLa cells measured under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions is not affected in the presence of Vpu, it is concluded that Vpu reduces the number of TASK channels at the plasmamembrane by interacting with the K+ channel making it susceptible for degradation.

Consequently, channel activity of Vpu per se does not seem to be necessary to fulfill its auxiliary role in enhancing viral release. Yet, Vpu especially when inserted into lipid membranes shows channel activity which can be modulated by mutations. Escape mutant studies as done for M2 from influenza A (Hay et al., 1985) are lacking and a selective \u201cchannel blocker\u201d is not yet identified (Lamb and Pinto, 1997). The recent anti-channel drug BIT225, N-[5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-naphtalene-2-carbonyl]-guanidine, seems to fulfill the role as a Vpu channel blocker when administered in a concentration of 40 \u03bcM to Vpu reconstituted into artificial lipid membranes of a channel recording device (Khoury et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Structural information of Vpu has emerged from solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 6.2). In the late 1990s, two structural models of the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu have been published using solution NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 6.2). The structural features discovered have been a helix\u2013loop\u2013helix motif followed either by another short helix (Willbold et al., 1997) or a reverse turn (Federau et al., 1996, Wray et al., 1995). While the former data derived from recordings of Vpu expressed in E. coli purified and dissolved at high salt solution, the latter spectra have been recorded from a synthetic peptide dissolved in aqueous TFE solution. It is debated that the high salt solution induces the tertiary fold and thus the formation of the third helix. TFE is known to support helix formation but weakens the formation of a fold. More recent data in low salt solution confirm two helical motifs in the cytoplasmic domain (Wittlich et al., 2009). Measurements in the presence of micelles formed by dodecylphosphatidycholine (DPC) induce secondary elements (two helices) and a tertiary fold. Secondary structures are supported by CD spectroscopy (Wittlich et al., 2009, Wray et al., 1995). All structural investigations have in common that the two series 52 and 56 have not been phosphorylated. Investigations on the structural implications of phosphorylation of the two serines to the structure have been done either on a synthetic peptide in aqueous TFE solution (Coadou et al., 2001, Coadou et al., 2002) or on a peptide expressed in E. coli, purified and measured in the presence of DPC micelles (Wittlich et al., 2008). Without DPC upon posphorylation, parts of the cytoplasmic helices unwind into a \u03b2-strand (Coadou et al., 2002), while in the presence of DPC micelles, structural changes are limited to some loss of helicity of helix1 toward the C terminus and extension of helicity toward the N terminal side of helix2 (Wittlich et al., 2008).",

Applying the same technique to extended constructs of the TMD of Vpu with residues of the cytoplasmic domain indicates that the second helix is aligned parallel to the membrane surface (Marassi et al., 1999, Park et al., 2003). X-ray reflectivity measurements done with full-length Vpu on a lipid monolayer reveal that the second helix in the cytoplasmic domain is bound loosely (Zheng et al., 2001). The helical motif of the TMD of Vpu has been supported by site-specific FTIR spectroscopy (Kukol and Arkin, 1999). SSNMR data show that the TMD Vpu construct shows rotational dynamics within the lipid membrane (Park et al., 2006). The extent of the TMD helix is still controversial, when comparing all the SSNMR data. In a recent study, the length of the helical motif toward the C terminal side of the TMD is reported to extend beyond the hydrophobic slab of the bilayer (Sharpe et al., 2006).",

Computer simulations in various lipids identify a kink around Ser-24 due to the compensation of hydrogen bonding of the side chain with adjacent backbone residues toward the N terminal side (Kr\u00fcger and Fischer, 2008). Further bending of the helix is found from Ser-24 to Ile-20. Kinking is seen as a mechanism to compensate for varying lipid thicknesses.

On the bases of synthetic peptides linked together as either tetramers or pentamers and their channel activity, the latter state is reported to be the favored one (Becker et al., 2004). Full-length Vpu and its TMD alone, both expressed in vitro and analyzed using gel permeation chromatography, are found to be in a pentameric state (Hussain et al., 2007). Computational modeling of the TMD based on SSNMR data on expressed TMD of Vpu supports the pentameric state (Park et al., 2003) but a tetrameric state is also proposed. A combined experimental study using bilayer recordings on synthetic peptide based on the TMD and computational modeling using MD simulations is in favor of the pentameric assembly (Cordes et al., 2002).",

The protein is preceded by the structural protein E2 from which it is incompletely cleaved and succeeded by the nonstructural protein NS2. It is not clear at this moment to which side structural or nonstructural p7 belongs to. Abolishing the cleavage between E2 and p7 results in noninfections virions (Harada et al., 2000). Expressing E2 and p7 independently recovers the production of infectious virions making p7 an essential part of the life cycle of HCV. Also, functional relevant interaction of p7 with NS2 has been reported (Tedbury et al., 2011). NS2 is located to sites where viral replication and particle assembly take place. In the absence of p7, the location of NS2 to these sites is lost. This function of p7 is reported to be independent of its function as a channel protein. It has been suggested that p7 plays an accessory role in altering the topology of NS2 which consequently affects NS2 function (Ma et al., 2011).",

Using a so-called J6/JFH chimeric genome which can be used to study the HCV life cycle in human hepatoma cells (Huh-7.5), it has been shown that p7, but not its precursor forms E2-p7 and p7-NS2, is required for infectious virus production (Jones et al., 2007). Mutations in the basic loop between the two TMDs (KR33/35QQ or KR33/35AA) lead to a decrease of the amount of released infectious virions (Steinmann et al., 2007a). It is proposed that these mutations affect channel activity as they are at the mouth of the putative pore. Other mutations within the TMDs of p7 (TMD1 and TMD2), such as the highly conserved Trp-30 and Tyr-42 each of them being separately mutated into phenylalanine, impair the infectivity of the virions. Mutations of His-31 also do not have an effect on RNA replication (Steinmann et al., 2007a), similar to the wild-type p7 (Lohmann et al., 1999). Concluding from these data, p7 is not essential for viral entry, supporting the essence of p7 within the later stage of infectivity which is linked to virus assembly. Nevertheless, p7 is essential for the virus but the mechanism of ion channel activity is not yet linked to either of these events.",

The two TMDs and the short link between them have been identified as a consensus from the results of multiple secondary structure prediction programs (Cuthbertson et al., 2005). The antiparallel aligned p7 protein is hither forth called the monomer. The alignment as a monomer positions the TMDs so that a bundle could be formed in which the histidines of TMD1 of all the monomers point into the putative lumen. Consequently, a pivotal role for this particular histidine in gating has been suggested (Patargias et al., 2006). Other groups have also challenged computational modeling to fill the data from electron microscopy (EM) with structural information (Griffin et al., 2003). Most recent MD simulation studies with an extended p7 protein randomly positioned in a simulation box together with lipid molecules using coarse grained techniques support the antiparallel alignment of the TMDs in the p7 monomer (Luik et al., 2009). The role of histidine in the conductance of ions across the protein bundle has been supported by mutant studies of chemical synthesized p7 reconstituted into lipid bilayers (Chew et al., 2009). Studies with Cu2 + containing solutions in combination with wild-type and H17A mutants have allowed the conclusion that histidine is pore lining, as predicted earlier (Patargias et al., 2006).",

Both of the two TMDs are split into two segments with specific dynamics comprising four helical segments. The two unstructured N and C termini as well as the short and mobile loop segment between the TMDs comprising residues 28\u201336 are outside of the membrane. Residues 5\u201315 constitute a helical segment embedded into the micelles which is similar to the third segment in its dynamics. While the first helix has no membrane anchoring amino acids, the third helical segments including residues 41\u201348 seem to be affected by the dynamics of the loop segment. The second helix (residues 17\u201327) is found to be less mobile and it is suggested that this is due to the membrane anchoring aromatic residues Trp-30 and Tyr-31. Similarly, low mobility is also found for the fourth helix which is flanked by two prolines, Pro-49 and Pro-58, containing a stretch of five leucines (Leu-50\u2013Leu-54).",

Patch recordings with liposome identify slightly higher conductance levels at around 35, 57 120, and 184 pS when a pipette holding potential of + 140 mV is applied. Channel recordings are reported to be blocked by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) but not by amantadine. The pore lining TMDs is identified to be TMD1, since a major conductance level of about 60 pS has been found at a holding potential of + 100 mV when reconstituted into lipid bilayers. In contrast, there could be no channel recordings observed for TMD2. A synthetic full-length p7 construct derived from SPPS shows a reversal potential of 44.3 mV in a 10:1 (cis:trans) gradient buffer, suggesting a moderate cation selectivity (Premkumar et al., 2004).

This residue has also been found in M2, which is identified as proton sensor involved in gating of the channel. Conductance studies of p7 when reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers reveal that the presence of Cu2 + in the bath solution blocks the activity of p7 (Chew et al., 2009). Since copper ions can be complexed by histidines, this study confirms the orientation of these residues toward the pore. With histidines in the pore, it has also been suggested that this allows pH sensitivity in any kind of form (Patargias et al., 2006): is the p7 bundle just sensitive to protons but does not conduct them? Or is p7 also a proton conductor similar to M2? It has been now suggested that protonation of the histidines will lead to an opening of the pore (Foster et al., 2011). With further analogy to M2, the question arises, can the protein also be built by less than the six units as it is proposed to date? Of course, experimental evidence is given for larger units, such as hexamers and possibly heptamers.",

            "text": "One of these proteins is 6K, which is found in several viruses of Alphavirus genus belonging to the family togaviridae (Carrasco, 1995, Garoff et al., 1982, Madan et al., 2005, Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 1986, Strauss and Strauss, 1994, Wang et al., 2010a). Alphaviruses express their structural proteins in a polyprotein consisting of E3-E2-6K-E1-C which is proteolytically processed into its constituents (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991). The 6K protein is a 6 kDa hydrophobic protein of 60 amino acids which is palmitylated (Gaedigk-Nitschko et al., 1990, Lusa et al., 1991). It is found to be transported to the site of the plasma membrane via a p62/E1 complex and only to a lower extend incorporated into the budding virion (Lusa et al., 1991). Albeit site-specific mutation in the 6K region identifies viruses with reduced budding capabilities, a full deletion of the protein does not result in blocking viral replication. The lack of 6K leads to an altered spike structure of the virion and it is concluded that the protein is important for the correct assembly of the virion (McInerney et al., 2004). These findings make 6K another accessory protein which amplifies the release of virions. Two hydrophobic stretches in the sequence of 6K suggest two TMDs one of which would be long enough to span the bilayer (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991). A bioinformatics approach using a hidden Markov model reduces the number to only one TMD (Sonnhammer et al., 1998). A single TMD is also the conclusion drawn from mutation studies of Semliki Forest virus 6K protein in its interfacial region (Sanz et al., 2003). Ross River and Barmah Forest virus 6K proteins expressed in E. coli and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers form channels with conductance ranging from 40 to 800 pS (Melton et al., 2002). The large conductance is attributed to the formation of larger oligomeric units of the protein. No other roles than permeabilizing the lipid membrane and being involved in the budding process are known to date.",

Human coronaviruses have been known since the 1960s (Myint, 1995). In 2002, a member of the virus has been found to cross the species barrier and infected humans with a mortality rate of about 5%, and even higher for people above their sixties (Zhong et al., 2003). The symptoms are described by a SARS which are almost flu like and come with severe fever (Stadler et al., 2003). The name of the family derives from a corona like shape of the virion when observed in electron microscopy (Beniac et al., 2006). Coronaviruses belong to the enveloped viruses and harbor the largest positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 30\u201332 kb amongst the RNA viruses (Narayanan et al., 2008). The genome is transcribed into a large polyprotein which is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases. The structural proteins are spike (S), matrix (M), and nucleocapside proteins (N) as well as the envelope protein (E). A large series of accessory proteins is distributed toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Narayanan et al., 2008) among several proteins exhibiting channel activity, as listed below.",

            "text": "Protein E has a length of 76 amino acids with a short N terminus of 7\u20139 amino acids, a long TMD of 21\u201329 amino acids and a C terminus (Shen et al., 2003). When E protein is synthesized and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers, channel activity with conductance in the range of 50 pS is observed (Wilson et al., 2004). SDS-PAGE experiments identify E protein to form pentamers (Parthasarathy et al., 2008). Electrophysiological measurements using whole-cell clamp conditions of E protein gene infected HEK-293 cells reveal a current which is sensitive to the administration of HMA (Pervushin et al., 2009). FTIR spectroscopic investigations suggest a helical hairpin\u2010like structure for the long TMD of E protein (Arbely et al., 2004). It is argued that, the peptide is highly helical with hardly any tilt and has a phenylalanine (Phe-23) located toward the lipid head group region. In addition to that, an asparagine (Asn-15) would support the N and C terminal ends to assemble. NMR spectroscopic investigations support a helical TMD without any turns (Pervushin et al., 2009). Merely, a leucine residue (Leu-18) does not fit into the residual dipole coupling calculations proposing a non-helical section or a conformational flexible region. Computational modeling studies of the E protein in an implicit bilayer model using Monte Carlo simulations support the experimental results of the secondary structure of the membrane traversing helical domain to be helical (Chen et al., 2010). The calculation starts from a random conformation of the TMD fully embedded in the hydrophobic slab of the bilayer. The presence of HMA differences in the 1HN chemical shifts of two residues on either side of the TMD is found when compared to those without any drug (Pervushin et al., 2009). This is in contrast to measurements in the presence of amiloride. Consequently, HMA is suggested to be located within the pore most likely at the C terminal mouth.",

            "text": "ORF 3a of SARS-CoV is another protein identified to exhibit channel activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Lu et al., 2006). It is located between S and E proteins and built by 274 amino acids (Zeng et al., 2004). The protein is found at the site of the plasma membrane and in the cell (Tan et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2005) as well as in intracellular virus particles (Ito et al., 2005, Yu et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2005). The protein is also released in membranous structures from infected and 3a expressing cells (Huang et al., 2006). Similar to other channel-forming proteins of other viruses, 3a also interacts with a series of other host and viral proteins (Narayanan et al., 2008). Three TMDs are proposed at the N terminal side preceding a longer C terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 148 amino acids. Residues 127\u2013133 harbor a cystein rich region which is involved in connecting to monomeric 3a proteins into a covalently linked dimer (Lu et al., 2006). Two dimers assemble into another dimer via noncovalent bonds forming a tetrameric unit. Experimental data of the structure of 3a are not yet available. Up to now, only computational models are generated (Hsu and Fischer, 2011, Kr\u00fcger and Fischer, 2009). A variety of assembly protocols have been followed which can be categorized into protocols which screen the conformational space of the monomeric unit by a concerted movement of all TMDs and in those which build up the monomeric unit in a sequential manner. The latter means, two TMDs are assembled first following by the third TMD. Finally, in both protocols, the tetrameric assembly is done in a concerted screening protocol. While a concerted protocol proposes the third TMD to be pore lining (Kr\u00fcger and Fischer, 2009), one of the sequential protocols (assembling TMD1 and TMD2 first followed by adding TMD3) proposes the second TMD to be pore lining in the tetramer (Hsu and Fischer, 2011). The rational for using the sequential assembly for the monomers is that it most likely resembles a biological relevant translocon based pathway of assembly. Along these investigations, the finding of unusual residues lining the lumen of the pore such as tyrosines and histidines is a common feature. In addition for TMD2 lining the pore, a ring of histidines is formed in the tetramer (Hsu and Fischer, 2011). With histidines pore lining, the channel is getting in line with M2 of influenza A and computational models of p7 from HCV (Patargias et al., 2006). It needs to be evaluated whether 3a is sensitive to protons. The role of 3a in the life cycle of SARS-CoV is not elucidated yet.",

            "text": "More recently, another open reading frame of SARS-CoV has been identified to exhibit channel activity. ORF 8 is separated into two ORFs 8a and 8b in human isolates with a 29-nt deletion (Guan et al., 2003). Protein 8a has been identified to amplify viral release and to induce the hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (Chen et al., 2007a). Consequently, it is concluded that 8a is involved in cellular apoptosis. Patients with antibodies against 8a recovered from SARS-CoV infection. 8a is identified as a 39 amino acid transmembrane protein (Guan et al., 2003). Secondary structure prediction programs suggest the N terminus to be transmembrane followed by an extramembrane domain containing approximately 15\u201320 (Chen et al., 2011). A peptide corresponding to full-length 8a derived from SPPS and reconstituted into artificial lipid membranes exhibits weak cation specific channel activity with conductance of around 9 pS at elevated temperatures (38.5 \u00b0C). Since the sequence of 8a is rich of cysteins, experiments have also been done under reducing conditions. Computational modeling of the TMD reveals a sequence of cysteins on one side parallel to the helix axis and a hydrophobic stretch of serines and threonines on the opposing side. Assembling the single TMD around a central axis into tetra-, penta-, and hexamers delivers potential structures for the putative pore. Consequent molecular dynamics simulations show a pentameric model maintaining a continuous water column. This model shows Ser-11 and Thr-8 as well as Cys-15 to be pore lining. In addition, the C terminal mouth is surrounded by Arg-22.",

All three of them are identified as auxiliary proteins, also interacting with a series of other viral and host proteins (Narayanan et al., 2008). All three proteins have in common, that their roles within the viral life cycle have yet to be identified. Channel activity is found either with expression of the protein in other cells or by reconstitution of the proteins into artificial lipid membranes. The question emerges why the virus needs three channels while all other channel expressing viruses known to date proteins only need one type of channel protein.",

It has been identified to render the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane permeable for small molecules and especially calcium ions (Aldabe et al., 1996, Doedens and Kirkegaard, 1995, van Kuppeveld et al., 1997a). It has also been reported that 2B is retained in the Golgi apparatus where it increases the release of Ca ions, a role which is also found for the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of 2B (de Jong et al., 2006). More recently, it has been reported that 2B is also able to conduct monovalent ions and its conductance can be blocked by a known chloride channel blockers such as 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyanatostilben-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid (Xie et al., 2011). The measurements have been done using two electrode voltage clamp conditions and with 2B expressed in Xenopus oocytes. 2B is composed of two hydrophobic domains (van Kuppeveld et al., 1995, van Kuppeveld et al., 1997b) and is found to homooligomerize into tetramers (Cuconati et al., 1998, de Jong et al., 2002, van Kuppeveld et al., 2002). In a computational approach, a dimeric and tetrameric structure of 2B from Polio virus have been proposed (Patargias et al., 2009). The individual TMDs have been modeled into an ideal helix and inserted into a fully hydrated lipid bilayer to relax the structure during a short molecular dynamics simulation. The individual TMDs have then been taken to form the monomer. After another MD simulation, the tetramers have been produced and also relaxed for many nanoseconds of MD simulations. From those models, it is suggested that both TMDs contribute to form the lumen of the pore. It is further suggested that lysines contribute to the inner face of the pore. A short peptide based on 20 amino acids of the second TMD has been able to permeabilize the plasmamembrane of cells (Madan et al., 2007). The experiments show that TMD2 alone could form a pore and possibly is at least part of the pore lining motif of the bundle made of the full-length protein.

Sequence homology with the potassium KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998) has been proposed and consequently a structural model is suggested to be similar to KcsA. In Xenopus oocytes, the protein induces channel activity and it is suggested that the channel is important for viral entry (Mehmel et al., 2003, Neup\u00e4rtl et al., 2008). It can be blocked by amantadine and barium ions (Plugge et al., 2000). A series of mutants have been analyzed in respect to the consequences on the physiology of the channel and its mechanism of function (Gazzarrini et al., 2004). Extended physiological measurements reveal two types of kinetics of the channel (Abenavoli et al., 2009). This identifies that despite of the small size and without any extramembrane domains, the protein undergoes diverse gating behavior similar to other K+ channels. Computational models of Kcv built on homology modeling and implementation of NMR spectroscopic data have been generated (Tayefeh et al., 2007, Tayefeh et al., 2009). The simulations show functional relevant amino acids and facilitated ion movement through the selectivity filter. Another K+ channel has also been found in the genome of brown algae infecting Ectocarpus siliculosus and called Kesv (Chen et al., 2005). With its 124 amino acids, it is slightly longer than Kcv. Three potential hydrophobic regions have been identified by sequence analysis. The channel is blocked by barium ions and amantadine.",

            "text": "Pore forming toxins (PFTs) are a class of proteins which are expressed by bacteria as well as higher organisms (Iacovache et al., 2008) and even human cells (Agerberth et al., 1995) to protect them against or support an attack. Their role is to punch holes into the membrane and enable the draining of the cytoplasmic interior and thereby leading to cell death. Pores formed by this class of proteins tend to be highly unselective. They are considered in this review since in a recent study about sequence alignment of Vpu from HIV-1 with ClyA identified an alignment of the TMD of Vpu with the membrane spanning domain of ClyA, \u03b1A (Fischer and Hsu, 2011). There are two classes of PFTs depending on the membrane spanning motif they use: those which adopt a helical motif, \u03b1-PFTs, such as ClyA (Mueller et al., 2009), and those which adopt a \u03b2-barrel motif, \u03b2-PFTs, such as \u03b1-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus (Song et al., 1996). (For an overview, refer to http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/Membrane_Proteins_xtal.html.) The mode of action of PFTs goes through various steps. The proteins are released, they will \u201csee\u201d an aqueous environment, have to attach to the membrane, and assemble to finally convert into a membrane protein which intrudes into the membrane. Many of these modes are not comparable to the mode of action of Vpu except when the toxins are embedded in the membrane to form unselective pores.",

            "text": "ClyA belongs to the class of \u03b1-PFTs. In its functional form, it forms a 400 kDa pore of 12 monomers with a height of 13 nm and an inner pore diameter of 7 nm (Mueller et al., 2009). The single protein consists of four helices, \u03b1A, \u03b1B, \u03b1C, and \u03b1F which are oriented parallel to the membrane surface. Upon membrane attachment of the monomer, its \u03b2-tongue, \u03b2t, named like that because of the short \u03b2-fold found in this region, initiates membrane anchoring and a rise of the monomer aligning the helices perpendicular to the membrane surface. At this stage, assembly is also initiated and the monomers align head-to-head into a dodecamer. Assembly facilitates the interlocking of the 12 \u03b1As into an iris-like arrangement which intrudes into the membrane stabilizing the pore. Due to the enormous size, this pore can then be considered to be \u201copen\u201d leading to the vanishing of the hydrophobic permeation barrier of the lipid membrane and with it of any electrochemical or substrate gradients across the plasma membrane. Smaller PFTs such as alamethicin, magainin, or melittin follow the same strategy with the only difference that they form either a pore fully mantled by protein (barrel-stave model) or a pore with the phospholipid head groups part of the mantling wall (toroidal model) (Huang, 2000, Shai and Oren, 2001).",

            "text": "Due to the similarity of Vpu with \u03b1A of ClyA, the following speculations are allowed: Vpu assembles into homooligomers. Numbers range from 4 to 5 as minimal assembly units. With the tetramer, most likely no channel activity should be possible adopting a tight helix packing motif. With a pentameric assembly, ions would be able to pass through and with hexameric or larger bundles ion selectivity should be lost and substrates may also be able to pass through. With 5 and more monomers, the pore could be mantled by the TMDs. Tilts of the TMD of Vpu have been measured and range from about 6\u00b0 (in DMPC; Kukol and Arkin, 1999) to 13\u00b0 (Park et al., 2003), 18\u00b0 (Park and Opella, 2005), and lower than 20\u00b0 (Sharpe et al., 2006) with the latter three values obtained with peptide reconstituted into DOPC. Upon thinning of the membrane, the tilt of Vpu will increase because of compensating for the mismatch with the lipid bilayer (Park and Opella, 2005). The angles obtained for Vpu are lower than the observed tilt in the crystal structure of ClyA 2WCD (Mueller et al., 2009) which adopts values around 45\u00b0 in detergents. It is possible that in a lipid bilayer this value may be lower as well. It is therefore speculated for Vpu that possibly lipid composition and lipid dynamics may act as trigger to gate the protein bundle (Mehnert et al., 2007, Mehnert et al., 2008) (Fig. 6.4\n).",

            "text": "With the emergence of the crystal structure (0.32 nm) of the bacterial (Streptomyces lividans) potassium channel KcsA, a keystone for ion channel structure has been delivered (Doyle et al., 1998, MacKinnon, 2003). Its topology has been identified to be bitopic with an inner and outer helix. The two helices are linked by the \u201cpore helix\u201d and the selectivity filter. Four subunits form the channel by lining a pathway for ions to cross the bilayer. The passage of an ion can be described as passing a gate on the cytoplasmic side and moving into a vestibule which stabilizes the ion via the dipole moment of a so-called inner helix. The ions need to pass the selectivity filer in a concerted motion with already potassium ions located within the filter already. With its high selectivity, KcsA shows similarity with voltage-gated K channels (Kv) in terms of ion permeation and similarity in topology with inward rectifying K channels (Kir). Important to note is that KcsA channels are triggered by pH changes. Deciphering the cause of the enormous selectivity of K channels for potassium over sodium is a challenge up to date (Noskov and Roux, 2006). It is anticipated that the structure of KcsA represents a closed stage. With the structure (0.33 nm) of a prokaryotic (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) calcium-gated K channel, a model in the open stage is described (Jiang et al., 2002a, Jiang et al., 2002b). With this discovery and in comparison with the KscA structure, a gating mechanism can be proposed (Sansom et al., 2002). During activation, the inner helices push radial outward and open the constriction at the cytoplasmic side. This opening is accompanied by a hinge around a glycine residue at position 99 (G99). This is the most pronounced conformational change so far described for ion channels. The selectivity filter remains unchanged in its structural position and the outer helix only undergoes marginal conformational changes (Jiang et al., 2002b). Also, hydrogen bonding seems to be essential for the gating mechanism (Rapedius et al., 2007). As a conclusion for the context of this review and in respect to the findings for Vpu in relation to KcsA (Fischer and Hsu, 2011), the four outer helices seem to fulfill the role as a sheltering corona toward the lipid environment.",

            "text": "Mechanosensitive channels (Msc) belong to a class of ion channels which respond on the mechanical stress within a lipid bilayer (Anishkin and Sukharev, 2009, Kloda et al., 2008, Perozo and Rees, 2003). They are designed by nature to sense alterations in osmotic and mechanic pressures imposed onto the lipid membrane. By sensing the change, they enable the physiological relevant ions to diffuse passively through their interior to alter electrochemical and substrate gradients of relevant cells (Zhou et al., 1991). Consequently, these membrane proteins convert the mechanical stress into readable signals for our nervous system. Two types of Msc can be distinguished according to the levels of conductance they generate: mechanosensitive channels of small (MscS) and large conductance (MscL). For both types of channels, crystallographic data from bacterial channels are available (Bass et al., 2002, Chang et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2009, Steinbacher et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2008). Focusing on MscL and the crystal structure of a homologous protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Chang et al., 1998), the protein has been identified to consist of a pentameric homoassembly with two TMDs. Its water filled pore is aligned with hydrophilic residues and has a diameter of about 1.8 nm. It is assumed that this structure catches the closed state of the channel. Other structures are reported to be due to intermediate states of the opening (Liu et al., 2009). This structure (Liu et al., 2009) includes a truncation in the cytoplasmic domain which allows the TMDs to adopt an increased tilt compared to the \u201cclosed\u201d and stable state of the protein. This protein has shown increased current and therefore supports the idea of now having a structure in a more open state, albeit the still very narrow pore diameter. However, the protein is reported to be a tetramer in contrast to the earlier studies of the MscL in the closed state (Chang et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the larger tilt of the TMDs in a partially open state compared to the tilt in the closed structure indicates a sliding mechanism for opening (Fig. 6.5B).",

            "text": "Information about the morphology of the protein has mostly been derived from electron microscopy (Unwin, 2003, Unwin, 2005, Unwin et al., 1988). The channel can be divided into three parts, a large extracellular domain hosting the N termini of the subunits, a membrane spanning part which contains the gate, and a smaller cytoplasmic domain. The overall length of the protein is 16 nm, with a pore of about 2 nm in diameter. The two binding sites of the neurotransmitter are about 4 nm above the membrane surface and opposing each other. Cryo-electron microscopy has been used to derive structural features of the receptor when briefly exposed to acetylcholine and immediately frozen (Unwin, 1995, Unwin, 1998). The data yield a resolution of 0.9 nm. In comparison with earlier structures, which are related to the closed state, the major changes in the open state are due to an alteration of the ligand binding domain which initiates a small axial rotation in each of the two TMDs of the respective subunits almost 5 nm away. Imposing structural data into the models suggest that the closed state is due to a constriction of the pore in the middle of the membrane caused by Leu-251 from each subunit, so to speak a ring of leucines. The residues are part of the pore lining M2 helix of each subunit. The constriction does not result from an almost overlap of the five residues; it rather follows from an approach of these residues. The consequence of this approach is a hydrophobic barrier which interrupts the water column which would otherwise fit through the pore. Upon activation, the ring widens through a rotational motion, twist-to-open (Miyazawa et al., 2003, Unwin, 2003), giving enough space so water can pass this barrier, which represents the gate of the channel. Passing of water in the open stage has been shown using molecular dynamics simulations on the TMDs of the receptor embedded in a hydrated lipid bilayer (Beckstein and Sansom, 2006). It has been suggested that this mechanism is a blue print for other members of the ligand-gated ion channels (Unwin, 2003).",

            "text": "The bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi also expresses a ligand-gated ion channel which belongs to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (ELIC). Crystal structures of this channel in its potential closed state have been obtained (Hilf and Dutzler, 2008). The ELIC channels show 16% sequence homology with nAChR\u03b1 and comprise the closest to a structure representing this class of ligand-gated ion channels. In terms of the extramembrane and transmembrane part, this channel approximately adopts the same dimensions (9.5 \u00d7 11 nm) as the nAChR. In contrast to the nAChR, the channel has no cytoplasmic domain. The 10 \u03b2-strands of each of the subuntis mantle a cylindrical vestibule of approximately 1.6 nm diameter. Within the membrane, the pore narrows down to a diameter of 0.7 nm lined by one of four helical TMDs per subunit. Toward the extramembranes segment, the transmembrane passage is confined by a ring of phenylalanines (F246) and leucines (L239). It is anticipated that these two constriction sites form a gate similar to the ring of leucines in the nAChR. Similar to the nAChR, the respective TMDs \u03b11 and \u03b13 are involved in inter-subunit contact, whereas \u03b12 lines the pore. The TMD \u03b14 is positioned at the periphery of the transmembrane subunit. Since the ligand triggering of the channel is not known, a study about the potential open state cannot be conducted. Cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus encodes a pentameric ion channel (GLIC) (Hilf and Dutzler, 2009) homologous to ELIC which is activated by low pH and does not desensitize after activation. Crystal structure of the channel at pH 4 with a resolution of 0.31 nm is therefore considered to show the open state of this channel. The structure of GLIC is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the structure of ELIC and therefore the data are taken to identify a novel gating mechanism for the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The lumen of the pore in the transmembrane region confines gradually toward the cytoplasmic side. This is due to \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices which are rotated as a rigid unit around Val-267 by about 9\u00b0. The extramembrane part of the pore is flanked by hydrophobic residues while the cytoplasmic part is flanked by polar side chains. Both ends of the channel are guarded by rings of acidic residues. The narrow part at the cytoplasmic end is due to a ring of glutamate residues (E221). Crystallization of a mutant channel in which the glutamate residues are replaced by alanine under the same experimental conditions (low pH) reveals a similar overall conformation of the protein backbone but with the restriction derived from the glutamic acids being removed. This indicates that the local change of the amino acid residues does not alter their conformation and that only minor changes of the side chains allow an increased pore radius. The conclusion is that the glutamates interact directly with the permeant cations. The studies on both ELIC and GLIC are considered as studies on a closed (ELIC) and open (GLIC) ligand-gated ion channel. The opening is shown to result from a change in the tilt of two of the TMDs, \u03b12 and \u03b13, of each of the subunits around a pivot point two-third across the transmembrane pore. This is proposed for nAChR in contrast to the rotational motion of M2, which is similar to \u03b12.",

One of the proteins, which allow protons to move across the membrane, is the light driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) from Halobacterium halobium (Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1971). Bacteriohodopsin is part of a family of light activated membrane proteins such as halorhodopsin and rhodospin. Albeit the fact that this protein needs light to activate a vectorial proton transport to build up a proton motif force, the movement of the protons along certain amino acids within the protein can give an idea of what is necessary for proton translocation. Bacteriorhodopsin has been analyzed in great details using techniques like cryo-electron microscopy (Henderson et al., 1990), FTIR spectroscopy (R\u00f6dig et al., 1999, Rothschild, 1992), NMR spectroscopy (Herzfeld and Lansing, 2002), X-ray crystallography (Edman et al., 1999), kinetic analysis (K\u00f6tting and Gerwert, 2005), and other techniques.",

Lipid rafts are cholesterol and glycosphingolipid rich detergent-resistant membrane patches (Simons and Ikonen, 1997, Stier and Sackmann, 1973). Purification of M2 from infected cells or eukaryotic expression systems has identified the presence of cholesterol (Schroeder, 2010, Schroeder et al., 2005). Therefore, it has been suggested that M2 from influenza A is attached to lipid rafts in vivo (Lin and Schroeder, 2001, Schroeder and Lin, 2005). Since all of the M2 channel recording data identify the function of M2, even when taking just its TMD and not even covalently linked together, it seems that rafts just only serve as a scaffold for in vivo function. To combine these findings, it is suggested that in the case of a raft attachment of a monomeric protein, or dimeric protein in case of M2, several of the raft patches can form a trapped cholesterol free \u201cpatch\u201d in which the protein can function as a proton channel (Lin and Schroeder, 2001).",

Expression of Vpu in human 293 cell lines reveals that it partitioned into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains. Its partitioning could be abolished when residues in the TMD are substituted by alanines. Mutations of Trp22 and a sequence on the middle of the domain, IVV19, are key residues responsible for microdomain integration. Taken together with computational modeling data in which it is suggested that Vpu is flexible and adopts to its environment via residues in the region from Ile-17 to Ser-24 (Kr\u00fcger and Fischer, 2008, Park et al., 2003), replacement of these residues hampers essential flexibility necessary for domain integration. Important to note is that raft association is not required for CD4 downregulation and that the above mutations can be correlated with a reduced particle release (Ruiz et al., 2010b). The exact placement within the microdomain is unclear and it could still be suggested, similar to M2, that channel activity of Vpu, which is independent of the cholesterol or sphingolipid content, could be achieved with the protein \u201creleased\u201d from the raft into the confined space of an entrapped cholesterol free patch surrounded by rafts.",

Most striking is their highly specific mode of action which is expected to require a low dose to be administered. In addition, peptide drugs seem to be toxicologically safe and are found to exhibit lower side effects than their small molecule counterparts (Agyei and Danquah, 2011). Peptide drugs, despite the benefit, harbor some draw backs. Even though they are now more comfortably manufactured, administering of the drugs is still a major hurdle for their use on a broader scale (Shaji and Patole, 2008). Injection still is the major route for entering the drug into the body and up to now mostly used for treating diabetes. Among the routes of administering, oral or nasal routes are still the most favorable ones. Once administered, they also face difficulties such as fast enzymatic degradation, membrane impermeability due to their size, and metabolic stability. Thus, chemical modifications are also necessary not only to generate a deliverable form of the drug but also to increase the retention time of the drugs in the body to improve their therapeutic value. One of the routes to improve the therapeutic value is to use peptides and develop peptidomimetics. The latter step is used to develop antimicrobial peptides (Godballe et al., 2011, Scott et al., 2008).",

The idea of this peptide is to mimic the trimer-of-hairpins state of gp41 which consists of six helical elements of gp41 tightly packed. With only five helices, it is anticipated that the steric vacancy for the 6th helix will be taken up by the C-peptide region of the viral gp41 protein under native conditions. This interaction hampers the fold of gp41 into the trimer-of-hairpin state. Shorter peptides have been suggested to target the C terminal region further (Eckert and Kim, 2001). Also, conserved hydrophobic pockets in the N terminal region of gp41 are targeted by peptides including small molecules (Debnath, 2006). Currently, computational methods such as MD simulations have been applied to assess the binding and search for novel peptides (Strockbine and Rizzo, 2007). These developments have led to the first antifusion drug enfuvirtide (Poveda et al., 2005, Steffen and P\u00f6hlmann, 2010). D-peptides, which show better affinity and bioavailability, are also reported to interfere with gp41 (Welch et al., 2007). Most recently, a peptide based on \u03b11-antitrypsin has shown promising results in patients (Forssmann et al., 2010). This 20\u2010amino\u2010acid peptide targets the fusion peptide of gp41.",

Activity occurs in two stages. In a nonspecific way at higher concentrations (> 0.1 mM), it affects the fusion event hampering the conformation of hemagglutinin to the fusion relevant conformational state. At a later stage of the viral life cycle and at much lower concentrations (0.1\u20135 \u03bcM), the drug acts strain specific against virus assembly. At this stage, it prevents the transformation of the fusion protein to forming a so-called high pH conformational stage. The nonspecific action can also be achieved by a series of amines (Hay et al., 1985). Mutant escape studies have shown that a series of hydrophobic residues at positions 27, 30, 31, and 34 of M2 (Hay et al., 1985) as well as 26 (Wang et al., 1993) are mutated in respective strains. Mapping the residues onto a helical wheel indicates that they are clustered on one side and assumed to face the inside of the bundle rather than the lipid environment (Sugrue and Hay, 1991). Thus, amantadine is assumed to intrude into the pore and block the protein by occlusion of the pore. Computational modeling of the drug in the center of an in silico model of the pore have been undertaken along this line (Sansom and Kerr, 1993). The M2 model has been built by copy-rotation of the monomer so that the hydrophilic residues face the lumen of the pore resulting in a slightly wider pore at the N terminal side than on the C terminal side. By positioning amantadine along the center of the pore and calculating for each position the interaction energy, a profile has been generated, which indicates a favorable binding site at the level of Ser-31 with the amantadine cube facing the N terminal mouth and the amino group the C terminal side. The same experiments with a cyclic-pentylamine have not revealed a favorable binding site at the same position. Neutron diffraction experiments confirmed a position in the area between Val-27 and Ser-31 (Duff et al., 1994). In a similar approach, using molecular dynamics simulations, amantadine has been positioned in the same way as reported (Sansom and Kerr, 1993) within the pore of M2 (Yi et al., 2008). The computational model of M2 has been leaned on an assembly based on NMR spectroscopic investigations (Hu et al., 2007). During the molecular dynamics simulation of 15 ns, the drug remains at its position around Ser-31 supporting the site of interaction of amantadine with M2. In another proposal, amantadine is modeled to be within the central cavity with the amino group closer to the ring of histidines (Gandhi et al., 1999).",

In this crystallographic study with a peptide corresponding to the TMD of M2 with only one mutation at position 34, where glycine is replaced by alanine, the location of amantadine is in the lumen of the pore on the N terminal side (3C9J; Stouffer et al. 2008). The crystal structure is obtained at low pH (pH 5.3) representing an open-like or conducting channel. Residues such as Val-27, Ala-30, Ser-31, and Gly-34 \u201ctrap\u201d the drug so that its amino group points toward the C terminal side. It has been shown that mutation of these residues makes the channel insensitive to amantadine (Deyde et al., 2007). Since amantadine shows no cooperativity (Wang et al., 1993), this binding site is seen as the single site and the mode of action as an \u201coccluding the pore.\u201d Based on solid state NMR spectroscopic studies of a peptide corresponding to the TMD of M2 derived from SPPS and reconstituted into DLPC (1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine), a binding site near Ser-31 has been suggested (Cady et al., 2009), which has been confirmed in a later experiment (Cady et al., 2010). Also, at higher amatadine concentrations, solid state NMR experiments suggest a second site at the C terminal side which should be considered as a weak binding site with low affinity (Cady et al., 2010). Molecular dynamics simulations over 15 ns with the amantadine bound M2 model from crystallography show that the drug remains at the position disrupting the continuous water column similar to the ring of valines (at position 27). Therefore, it is concluded that the mode of amantadine blocking is by interfering with the water molecules at the mouth of the pore.",

The protein, a His-p7 construct, shows burst activities at a holding potential of \u2212 120 mV. Adding amantadine to a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM into both chambers of the setup leads to a complete abrogation of the bursts after about 10 s. Application of amantadine to HCV replication cell cultures (Lohmann et al., 1999) revealed no effect of the drug on RNA replication, virus release, and infectivity of the virions (Steinmann et al., 2007b). Using a peptide derived from SPPS, corresponding to specific strain of HCV (GT 1a, isolate H77) which also is reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer, addition of more than 10.3 \u03bcg/ml of amantadine has been necessary to affect channel activity of the p7 peptide. A full blocking, showing a zero channel activity, could not be achieved. A docking approach using AUTODOC 3.0 has been used to dock amantadine onto a computationally derived hexameric model of p7 (Patargias et al., 2006). The study proposes a binding site of the drug within the lumen of the pore between residues H17 and Ser21, with the amino group facing Ser21. The binding constant has been estimated to be around K\ni = 68 \u03bcM. Since amantadine is located toward two monomers, it allows plenty of space for ions to pass the pore. So far, amantadine has shown little effect in clinical trials (Deltenre et al., 2004, Maynard et al., 2006). Currently, a series of derivatives of amantadine have been tested (Foster et al., 2011).",

Experiments have been done with Vpu expressed in HeLa cells together with the Gag protein of HIV-1. Budding virus like particles have been observed by electron microscopy. Experiments in the presence of HMA in the culture medium after transfection of the cells with the expression plasmid lead to an almost complete inhibition of the budding process. Channel recording of a recombinant Vpu protein, expressed in E. coli, could be blocked with the addition of HMA in a range of 25\u2013125 \u03bcM. An allosteric blocking could be anticipated since it is reported that at lower HMA concentrations blockage is not complete. Blocking has also been dependent of the applied potential. Therefore, it seems that blocking also depends on the side of which the drug approaches the channel. In the same type of experiments, a derivative dimethyl amiloride (DMA) also affects channel recordings in a similar way. Since blocking by DMA has been less complete than by HMA at higher concentrations, a lower potency for DMA has been concluded. Amiloride itself has shown no effect in this study. The data have been confirmed in a study using a Vpu peptide (Vpu1-32) reconstituted into artificial \u201cmicro\u201d bilayers which are spanning a porous silicon device (R\u00f6mer et al., 2004). Adding 100 \u03bcM of both HMA and DMA to a measurement setup results in a full blocking of channel activity, while amiloride does not show any effect on the activity. In a computational study with a helical model of the monomeric TMD of Vpu and in an assembly of five and six TMDs forming bundles, putative binding sites of HMA and amiloride have been evaluated (Kim et al., 2006). Most striking are calculations of an estimated free energy using the docking program AUTODOCK 3.0. The calculations reveal lowest binding constant for HMA interacting with the pentameric bundle. Binding sites of HMA within the bundle identify an interaction of the guanidinium group of HMA at the site of Ser-24. Interaction of HMA with a monomeric TMD identifies Trp-23 as a potential site for interactions, suggesting \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. The computational data support the currently emerging idea of multiple binding sites of antiviral channel drugs and with it the suggestion of allosteric binding modes (Pielak et al., 2009, Schnell and Chou, 2008). From investigations on Vpu interacting with HMA\u2014two different inhibition levels at various drug concentrations in bilayer recording studies and two putative binding sites identified in a docking approach\u2014it seems very likely that Vpu also follows this path.",

Synthetic p7 derived from SPPS and reconstituted into lipid bilayers can be blocked by BIT225 at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM BIT225 on both sides of the measurement chamber and both filled with 50 mM KCl (Luscombe et al., 2010).

In combination with interferon alpha-2b, (rIFN\u03b1-2b) even a synergistic affect has been observed. BIT225 has now successfully completed phase Ib/IIa trials. The drug is also evaluated for its affection of Vpu (Khoury et al., 2010). A synthetic peptide construct representing the first 32 amino acids of Vpu including the TMD (Vpu1\u201332), reconstituted into lipid bilayers shows channel activity which is knocked out by a 40 \u03bcM solution of BIT225. In monocyte-derived macrophages chronically infected with HIV-2, which does not encode Vpu, no affect has been observed, which supports that Vpu is the target. A wide range of HIV-1 isolates are susceptible to BIT225 as well. Based on a computational evaluation of several guanidines on a pentameric Vpu1\u201332, BIT225 has come out as a highly potential candidate (Patargias et al., 2010). The study uses models of Vpu TMDs in which the serines (Ser-24) are facing the potential lumen of the pore. For this investigation, the docking software FlexX (BiosolvIT) has been used.",

It is water soluble, shows low toxicity, and is able to bind to cholesterol within the membrane. Viral membranes, especially those in HIV-1 virions, are found to exhibit some similarity in the composition to lipid rafts (Aloia et al., 1993, Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006). With the rafts containing cholesterol, AME alters the properties of the viral membrane. When Jurkat cells are infected with a plasmid containing an infectious full-length HIV-1 and continuously exposed to 10 \u03bcM AME escape mutants indicate mutations in an endocytoses motif in the cytoplasmic part of gp41, the viral fusion protein (Waheed et al., 2006). In another study, it has been shown that AME lowers virus production (Waheed et al., 2008). AME seems to be noneffective against the Gag-membrane protein assembly and Gag-association with detergent-resistant membranes. It rather lowers the amount of virion release by approximately fivefold. Vpu-deficient HIV mutants are insensitive to AME treatment also in the presence of an overexpression of CD317/BST-2/tetherin. Reinjection of the cells with Vpu plasmid makes the cell sensitive to AME again. This indicates that AME most likely disrupts the Vpu-CD317/DST-2/tetherin interaction. It is speculated that AME blocks ion channel activity of Vpu. Further, it may be speculated that Vpu may need raft association to be fully functional.",

While for M2, a detailed picture of the mechanics of proton translocation is emerging due to structural work, the reason for weak cation selectivity of most of the channels is still in the dark. Based on sequence alignment studies, a relation to host channels and toxins is drawn for some of the channel proteins. With Vpu relating to toxin ClyA, and ditopic channels like p7 and 2B relating to McsL and tritopic 3a likely to ligand-gated channels, the picture emerges that this type of protein covers the range from pores to channels. M2 as a proton channel may \u201cborrow\u201d mechanisms from other proton conducting and translocating membrane proteins. The evidence is growing that some of these proteins are raft associated. Also, the evidence emerges that channel functionality is not the only role these proteins inherit. Many of them interact with host factors to steer the cell toward the benefit of the virus (stage of steering). Questions arise whether this \u201csteering of the host\u201d is done as monomeric or oligomeric units. In addition to it, there is some kind of equilibrium between the \u201cstage of steering\u201d and the proper channel state as an oligomeric unit. Or is the interaction with the host to be seen as a kind of \u201chost based ligand\u201d closing the channel while without the host protein the channel is open; or do other ligands trigger activity? More surprising, with influenza A and SARS-CoV two viruses emerge which harbor more than one channel protein. On the other end of this scale, for Dengue virus there is no report of any channel protein up to now despite its membership to the same family, Flaviviridae, as HCV.",

Since structural information is sparse for most of the channels, development of pore occluding drugs is difficult. Drug\u2013protein interaction seems to obey, in the same sophisticated way as for any other host or protein of pathogens, allosteric binding modes. On the other hand, drug development is challenged, due to the fact that protein\u2013protein interactions between viral and host proteins are also happening within the lipid membrane. Thus, novel concepts for finding drugs are essential. This may put peptide drugs, peptidomimetics, and plant-derived drugs in an elevated position for lead discovery.",
