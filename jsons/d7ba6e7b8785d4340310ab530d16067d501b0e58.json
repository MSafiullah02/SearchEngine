In this work, we present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to deal with such issues and detects arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Data streams generally implicate the challenge that the data cannot be stored entirely and hence there is a general demand for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. We therefore propose the CashStream algorithm that unites state-of-the-art stream processing techniques and additionally relies on the Hough transform to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters. Our experiments compare CashStream to its static counterpart and show that the amount of consumed memory is significantly decreased while there is no loss in terms of runtime.",

However, when facing high-dimensional data, particularly clustering algorithms quickly reach the boundaries of their usefulness as most of them are not designed to deal with the problems known by the \"curse of dimensionality\". Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects and, thus, can no longer be used to distinguish similar from dissimilar objects. Furthermore, clusters often appear within different lower dimensional subspaces. Therefore, it is usually not useful to search for clusters in the full dimensional data space or apply dimensionality reduction which would only result in one subspace rather than several different ones. To overcome those issues, several subspace clustering algorithms have been developed in the past that simultaneously search for meaningful subspaces and for clusters (within these subspaces). Some of these algorithms, e.g. [4, 15, 16] , assume attribute independence and restrict themselves to the detection of axis-parallel subspace clusters for performance reason. More general, so-called correlation clustering algorithms, e.g. [1, 2, 7, 8] , allow arbitrarily oriented subspaces that represent a (usually linear) combination of features, i.e., explicitly allow correlation among features.",

Nowadays, as data is produced with high velocity, streaming algorithms become more and more important. This also holds for areas where high-dimensional data is produced rapidly, e.g., in industry where large numbers of machine sensors record huge amounts of data within short time periods. In these scenarios, the data can usually no longer be stored entirely and hence there is a general need for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. In this work, we tackle this problem and present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in data streams. This method not only reduces the amount of required memory for processing the data significantly, but also compresses entire groups of data that are similar wrt to various combinations of features. The key idea of the proposed method is to load chunks of data into memory, deriving so-called Concepts as summary structures and applying a decay mechanism to downgrade the relevance of stale data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of the presented method and shows that the used heap space is drastically reduced without losses in terms of runtime and accuracy.",

The idea is to represent a set of data objects by only a few key statistics that sufficiently describe the aggregated data. This approach has been adapted for many other stream clustering approaches, e.g., [3, 9, 10] . Another compression technique that is widely employed for stream clustering is to only keep track of the cluster representatives. The basic idea is to represent entire chunks of data solely in form of cluster representatives, e.g., cluster centroids, [12, 17, 23] .

The SiblingTree method [18] is a grid-based axis-parallel subspace clustering approach aiming at detecting all low-dimensional clusters in all subspaces. All these previously mentioned methods are limited to find axis-parallel subspaces.

A grid cell c that is dense after maxSplit divisions represents a cluster: the points corresponding to the functions intersecting c form a cluster within a arbitrarily oriented (d\u22121)-dimensional subspace. However, the cluster (or some of the contained objects) might form an even lower dimensional cluster. Therefore, the object functions that form the (d \u2212 1)-dimensional cluster are transformed back into the data space and projected onto the orthonormal basis that can be derived from c.

To tackle these challenges, we propose to process incoming data in batches, similar to [12] , i.e., loading chunks of data into memory and eventually computing cluster representatives which are kept in memory while the actual data objects are discarded. This data processing scheme has several advantages as it (1) enables the adaptation to concept shifts since processing data batch-wise allows to identify dense grid cells 1 , potentially with novel subspaces, during the division steps, (2) caps the amount of consumed memory and (3) even allows the flexibility to adjust to changing data dimensionality as there is no need for defining a static grid. Precisely, our algorithm basically performs an adapted variant of CASH on single data chunks and keeps cluster representatives, that we will refer to as Concepts, in memory. Since the Concepts must be maintained efficiently, they are designed to be additive, such that two similar Concepts can conveniently be unified into a single Concept (see Fig. 2 ).

In particular, it can be seen that the unification of Concepts barely has any effect on the runtime performance. We also observe that the batch size barely affects this performance measure.",

Precisely, we report the heap space usage profiles for both approaches as the memory usage at runtime is the decisive performance metric. The shown graphs were created using Java ViusalVM 1.4.2, which is included in the Java JDK. To simulate a light-weight system, we cap the maximal available heap space to 2 GB (Fig. 4) . For this experiment, we again use the enlarged wages dataset. This time the dataset consists of 20000 data points (augmented the same way as previously). Figure 4a shows the heap usage profile when using a single batch that contains all data points, resp. the static version, and Fig. 4b shows the profile when computing the same experiment with three batches.",

Secondly, the three sequentially processed batches can clearly be identified as three peaks in the heap space profile.",

Precisely, CashStream relies on the subspace clustering paradigm that was introduced for the static CASH algorithm, i.e., using Hough transformations to identify interesting linear subspaces. However, in contrast to CASH, the proposed algorithm uses a batch processing scheme, identifies interesting subspaces within the data batches, and subsequently compresses important information within Concept data structures. Our experiments showed that CashStream is fairly robust against different choices for the batch size and simultaneously reduces the memory consumption significantly compared to the static CASH algorithm (less than 50% on the real-world dataset). At the same time the loss in terms of clustering quality is negligible.",

The calculated ARI and AMI for this dataset can be seen in Table 1 . In general, it can be observed that the clustering quality slightly drops when choosing a batch size below 1000. This might indicate that the subsample might not reflect the data distribution sufficiently when choosing the batch size too small, which can be especially problematic in scenarios where correlations are imperfect. Another reason for the decreasing clustering accuracy can be the presence of temporal effects (i.e., slight drifts in the data distribution, increasing amount of noise, etc.).Runtime/Throughput. We investigate the actual throughput in terms of data points per second. In general, our evaluation of the throughput can be understood as a runtime comparison between the batched algorithm and the static CASH. For the throughput experiment, we used the enlarged real-world dataset to demonstrate the scalability of the batched streaming approach. In Fig. 3 , we",
