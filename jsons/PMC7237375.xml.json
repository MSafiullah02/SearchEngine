For example, 54% of black adults have hypertension as compared to only 46% of white adults1. While 16.4% of black adults have diabetes, among white adults the rate is 11.9%2. And, although 38.4% of black adults fit the criteria to be considered obese, only 28.6% of white adults do3. Overall, minority and low-income groups tend to have worse outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality4. We knew early on that these conditions which are more prevalent in minority populations were markers of high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, yet we did not use this to inform our prevention and testing efforts. Doing so could have helped reduce transmission among higher risk populations, ultimately reducing the burden on our healthcare systems.",

Even now, as COVID-19 disparities become clear, the discussion seems to center on co-morbid conditions as the driver of disparities. But health disparities researchers have known all along that chronic disease disparities are symptomatic of larger causes. Social and structural differences in our communities and society make it easier for some to stay healthy and harder for others5. Policies, systems, and environments all combine to limit opportunities for health equality. Low education levels, poverty, food insecurity, low-quality housing, limited transportation options, the threat of crime, and a host of other \u201csocial determinants\u201d all contribute to health disparities. Such unfavorable conditions are especially prevalent among many majority African American communities.",

We must address these issues to ensure that testing is available and accessible to those who seem to be at highest risk of ending up hospitalized and needing intensive care.",
