Perhaps the most egregious example of biologic warfare involved the Japanese program in occupied Manchuria from 1932 to 1945.

The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Biological and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BWC) was ratified in 1972, formally banning the development or use of biologic weapons and assigning responsibility for enforcement to the United Nations.1 Unfortunately, the BWC has not been effective in its stated goals; multiple signatories, including the former Soviet Union and Iraq, have violated the terms and spirit of the agreement. The accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from a biologic weapons plant in the Soviet Union in 1979, with at least 68 human deaths from inhalational anthrax reported downwind, was proved years later to have occurred in the context of Soviet offensive weapons production.",

A World Health Organization (WHO) model based on the hypothetical effects of the intentional release of 50 kg of aerosolized anthrax spores upwind from a population center of 500,000 (analogous to that of Providence, RI) estimated that the agent would disseminate in excess of 20 km downwind and that nearly 200,000 people would be killed or injured by the event.5 Biologic weapons possess unique properties among WMDs. By definition, biologic agents are associated with a clinical latency period of days to weeks, in most cases, during which time early detection is quite difficult with currently available technology. Yet, early detection is critical because specific antimicrobial therapy and vaccines are available for the treatment and prevention of illness caused by certain biologic weapons; casualties from other forms of WMDs can generally only be treated by decontamination (with antidotes available for only some types), trauma mitigation, and supportive care. Additionally, the specter of a biologic attack provokes fear and anxiety\u2014\u201cterror\u201d\u2014disproportionate to that seen with other threats.",

For these reasons, state sponsorship or direct support from governments or organizations with significant resources, contacts, and infrastructure would predictably be required in large-scale events. However, recent revelations have suggested that some agents may be available on the worldwide black market and in other illicit settings,6 thus obviating the need for the production process. Although an efficient mode of delivery has traditionally been felt to be necessary, the anthrax attacks in the United States in late 2001 illustrated the devastating results that can be achieved with relatively primitive delivery methods (e.g., high-speed mail sorting equipment and mailed letters).",

The last of these refers to the reliability with which the pathogen causes high mortality, morbidity, or social disruption. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have prioritized biologic agent threats based on the aforementioned characteristics,7 and this has influenced current preparedness strategies (Table 63-2\n). Category A agents, considered the highest priority, are associated with high mortality and the greatest potential for major impact on the public health. Category B agents are considered \u201cincapacitating\u201d because of their potential for moderate morbidity but relatively low mortality. Most of the category A and B agents have been experimentally weaponized in the past and are thus of proven feasibility.

As discussed above, it is likely that the circumstances of any event will only be known in retrospect, therefore it may prove problematic to immediately discern the extent of exposure. Terrorists have an unlimited number of targets in most open, democratic societies; it is unrealistic to expect that without detailed intelligence data, all of these can be secured at all times. Certain sites such as government institutions, historic landmarks, or large events may be predictable targets, but there are other, less predictable possibilities. In fact, government data support businesses and other economic concerns as the main targets of global terrorism during the period from 1996 to 2002.9 Metropolitan areas are considered vulnerable, but owing to the expansion of suburbs, commuters, and the clinical latency period between exposure and symptoms inherent with biologic agents, casualties of bioterrorism are likely to present for medical attention in diverse locations and at varying times after a common exposure. An event in New York City on a Wednesday morning may result in clinically ill persons presenting over the ensuing weekend to a variety of emergency departments within a 60-mile radius. Additionally, modern modes of transportation ensure that there will be affected persons thousands of miles away at both national and international locations related to a common exposure.

The recognition of a single case of a rare or nonendemic infection, in the absence of a travel history or other potential natural exposure, should raise the suspicion of bioterrorism and should prompt notification of public health authorities. Finally, unusual patterns of disease such as concurrent illness in human and animal populations should raise suspicions of bioterrorism or another form of emerging infection.

Cutaneous anthrax occurred regularly in the first half of the twentieth century in association with contaminated hides and wools used in the garment industry, but it is uncommonly seen in current-day industrialized countries due to importation restrictions.

The diagnosis should also be considered in a single individual with a consistent or suggestive clinical illness in the absence of another etiology. The early recognition and treatment of inhalational anthrax is likely to be associ ated with a survival advantage.10 Therefore, prompt empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated if infection is clinically suspected. Combination parenteral therapy is appropriate in the ill person for a number of reasons: to cover the possibility of antimicrobial resistance; to target specific bacterial functions (e.g., the theoretical effect of clindamycin on toxin production); to ensure adequate drug penetration into the central nervous system; and perhaps to favorably affect survival.10 In the future, it is likely that novel therapies such as toxin inhibitors or receptor antagonists will be available to treat anthrax.19 Detailed therapeutic and postexposure prophylaxis recommendations for adults, children, and special groups have been recently reviewed elsewhere.14 Anthrax vaccine adsorbed has been proved to be effective in preventing cutaneous anthrax in human clinical trials and in preventing inhalational disease after aerosol challenge in nonhuman primates.20 The vaccine has generally been found to be safe but requires six doses over 18 months with the need for frequent boosting.

For this reason, early diagnoses of the first cases are likely to prove problematic and require heightened clinical vigilance.32 Even after early victims have been diagnosed, communications among hospitals and other healthcare institutions on a local, regional, national, and international level will be essential to define the epidemiology and possibly to identify exposure sources. Given the extent and ease of rapid movement within our world, clinical presentations from a point-source biologic attack could occur in widely disparate geographic locations. Additionally, it is likely that a terrorist attack would be multifocal in any case. A similar epidemiologic approach using case definitions, case identification, surveillance, and real-time communications is necessary whether the event is a malicious attack, emergent from nature, or unknown.33\n",
