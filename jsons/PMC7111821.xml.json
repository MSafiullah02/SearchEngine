Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses were divided into three distinct groups (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Ziebuhr, 2004, Brian and Baric, 2005). As a result of the unique mechanism of viral replication, coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Their tendency for recombination and high mutation rates may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches.",

            "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the discovery of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the identification of SARS-CoV-like viruses from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog from wild live markets in mainland China have led to a boost in interests in discovery of novel coronaviruses in both humans and animals (Guan et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2004a, Woo et al., 2004b). In 2004, a novel group 1 human coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was reported independently by two groups (Fouchier et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004). In 2005, we described the discovery, complete genome sequence, clinical features and molecular epidemiology of another novel group 2 human coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) (Woo et al., 2005a, Woo et al., 2005b, Woo et al., 2005c, Woo et al., 2005d). Recently, we have also described the discovery of SARS-CoV-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats and a novel group 1 coronavirus in large bent-winged bats, lesser bent-winged bats and Japanese long-winged bats in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) (Lau et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). Others have also discovered the presence of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats in other provinces in China (Li et al., 2005). Based on these findings, we suspected that a previously unrecognized large diversity of coronaviruses is present in bats in our locality. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a territory-wide coronavirus surveillance study in bats in HKSAR.",

            "text": "An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was observed in bats in HKSAR. In this study, among the 13 different species of bats captured, a total of eight coronaviruses were observed, with six being previously undescribed. This diversity of coronaviruses in bats could be related to the unique properties of this group of mammals. First, bats account for about 980 of the 4800 mammalian species recorded in the world. Although HKSAR is an urbanized, subtropical city, it has extensive natural areas with 52 different species of terrestrial mammals, with 40% of the species being bats. This diversity of bat species would potentially provide a large number of different cell types for different coronaviruses. Second, the ability to fly has given bats the opportunity to go almost anywhere, free from obstacles to land-based mammals. Bats have been found at altitudes of as high as 5000 m. This ability of bats would have allowed possible exchange of viruses and/or their genetic materials with different kinds of living organisms. Third, the different environmental pressures such as food, climates, shelters and predators would have provided different selective pressures on parasitisation of different coronaviruses in different species of bats. Fourth, the habit of roosting gives the opportunity to a large number of bats gather together. This would have also facilitated exchange of viruses among individual bats. Interestingly, the nucleotide sequences of the pol genes of bat-CoV HKU4-1, bat-CoV HKU4-2 and bat-CoV HKU4-3, collected at the same location (location A, Fig. 1), were the same, but different from that of bat-CoV HKU4-4, collected at another location (location B, Fig. 1); and the nucleotide sequences of the pol and helicase genes of bat-CoV HKU5-2, bat-CoV HKU5-3 and bat-CoV HKU5-5, collected at the same location (location C, Fig. 1), were also more closely related to each other, than to those of bat-CoV HKU5-1, collected at another location (location B, Fig. 1). We speculate that this was due to circulation of closely related strains of coronaviruses among bats found at the same locations.",

            "text": "From the results of the present study, we speculate that coronaviruses found in bats are bat genus/species specific, although one bat genus/species may harbor more than one type of coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses are particularly host specific and coevolved with their hosts, although host-shifting has also been demonstrated (Jonassen et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2005, Lai, 1990, Sturman and Holmes, 1983, Rest and Mindell, 2003). In this study, a huge variety of coronaviruses of groups 1 and 2, but not group 3, are found in bats in HKSAR, with the different coronaviruses being present in specific genus/species of bats. For SARS-CoV-like viruses, it was detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in our locality (Lau et al., 2005), whereas in some other provinces in China, it was detected in some other species of horseshoe bats of the same genus (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus pearsoni and Rhinolophus pussilus) (Li et al., 2005). In addition to SARS-CoV-like viruses, one additional type of coronavirus (bat-CoV HKU2) was also detected in Rhinolophus sinicus in the present study. Similarly, a coronavirus that we described previously was detected in species of the genus Miniopterus, Miniopterus pusillus in the present study and Miniopterus magnater, Miniopterus pusillus and Miniopterus schreibersii in the previous study (Poon et al., 2005), and bat-CoV HKU8 was also found in Miniopterus pusillus. Furthermore, bat-CoV HKU4 was detected in lesser bamboo bat, bat-CoV HKU5 detected in Japanese pipistrelle, bat-CoV HKU6 detected in rickett's big-footed bat, and bat-CoV HKU7 detected in greater bent-winged bats. On the other hand, there is no strict association between the group that a bat coronavirus belongs to and the corresponding bat genus/species that the virus resides, as both groups 1 and 2 coronaviruses can be found in Chinese horseshoe bats. This absence of association between coronavirus group among groups 1 and 2 coronaviruses and the species of the host is also observed in human coronaviruses, as humans are hosts to both group 1 (HCoV229E and HCoV-NL63) and group 2 (HCoV229E, CoV-HKU1 and SARS-CoV) coronaviruses. A larger scale study expanded to different regions will confirm this phenomenon of host specificity. The availability of genomic and mitochondrial sequence data on the bat species that harbor the coronaviruses discovered in the present study will enable analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of these viruses in relation to the phylogeny of their hosts.",

            "text": "Strains of bat-CoV HKU4 and bat-CoV HKU5 may constitute a new subgroup, group 2c, of group 2 coronaviruses. Using molecular and serological approaches, coronaviruses are divided into three groups. When SARS-CoV was discovered and its genome completely sequenced, it was first proposed that SARS-CoV belonged to \u201ca fourth group\u201d of coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). However, using multiple approaches, including both genomic and proteomic approaches, it was confirmed that SARS-CoV probably is an early split-off from the group 2 coronavirus lineage (Eickmann et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). It is now the consensus that SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-like viruses belong to a subgroup, group 2b, of group 2 coronaviruses, whereas the other group 2 coronaviruses, including murine hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, and the recently discovered CoV-HKU1, belong to group 2a. In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of two independent genes, pol and helicase genes, showed that the four strains of bat-CoV HKU4 and four strains of bat-CoV HKU5 were clustered and formed a unique lineage within group 2 coronaviruses, distinct from the group 2a and group 2b coronaviruses. The results were in line with those obtained from partial sequencing of about 200 nucleotides of the nucleocapsid genes of these two coronaviruses (unpublished data). Moreover, these two novel coronaviruses appear to be more closely related to group 2b than group 2a coronaviruses in both phylogenetic trees. Complete genome sequencing will confirm whether they represent a novel subgroup in group 2 coronaviruses, are more related to group 2a (e.g. presence of hemagglutinin esterase gene) or group 2b coronaviruses (e.g. presence of unique domain in nsp3), and have evolved as a result of recombination. Interestingly, the bootstrap values were particularly low at some nodes in the group 1 coronaviruses (Fig. 2), implying the phylogenetic relationships among some members of this group remained unclear. Unfortunately, the inherent difficulty in cultivating coronaviruses, the low viral load in the small volumes of samples from these small mammals, together with the huge differences in their nucleotide sequences from known coronaviruses, have caused major difficulties in achieving complete genome sequencing on the novel coronaviruses at this stage.",

Detailed primer sequences will be provided on request. Sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce the final sequences of the pol and helicase genes. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the pol and helicase genes were compared to those of other coronaviruses. Phylogenetic tree construction was performed by using the neighbor-joining method with GrowTree software (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI).",
