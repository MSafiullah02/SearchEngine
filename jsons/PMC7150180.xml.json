            "text": "\nInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis (Cavanagh, 1997). IBV is the prototype species of the Coronavirus family, Gamma coronavirus genus, classified in the order Nidovirales, and it is the type species of the genus coronavirus of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003, Cook et al., 2012). Infectious bronchitis (IB) was first observed by\nSchalk and Hawn (1931) in North Dakota in the United States in 2- to 3-week-old chickens. However, the nature of the infectious agent was not determined at that time and was assumed that IB was mainly a disease of young chickens. Hence, the disease was named \u201cinfectious bronchitis of young chicks.\u201d Five years later, it was demonstrated that the causative agent of this disease is a virus, which was named IBV (Beach and Schalm, 1936). Since that initial discovery, many different serotypes, defined by neutralizing antibodies, and genetic types, based on the deduced amino acid sequence (from the nucleic acid sequence) of the spike gene, have been described around the world (El-Houadfi et al., 1986, Jackwood et al., 1997).",

The variant was later found to be prevalent in Georgia. The DE072-specific vaccine was then used to control the infection with little or no success.

Interestingly, the IBVPR07 isolate, belonging to the Mass serotype, was found to have high tropism for the gonads and trachea (Montassier et al., 2008). In Mexico, several different genotypes have now been isolated which include Conn, Mass, and Ark type (Jackwood, 2012). Similarly, in 2001, new variants were identified. Of these, Max/1765/99 variant was isolated from 64% of chickens showing respiratory problems in Mexico, three new isolates were found to be similar with BL-56 earlier reported in 1996, whereas two other indigenous isolates were antigenically similar to Conn genotypes (Gelb et al., 2001).

Currently, live IBV vaccines are normally attenuated by multiple repeat passage of a virulent virus in SPF-ECEs (Cavanagh, 2003). However, extensive passage should be avoided to prevent the reduction in immunogenicity. There is an evidence that some attenuated vaccines showed increase in virulence after back passage in chickens (Hopkins and Yoder, 1986). These vaccines are commercially available for application via drinking water or by coarse spray at 1 day or within the first week of age. Live vaccination of 1-day-old chicks induced a rapid decline in maternally derived antibodies due to binding and partial neutralization of vaccine viruses (Mondal and Naqi, 2001). Since the duration of immunity following live attenuated vaccines is short, booster vaccination is carried out with the same or combinations of other strains, 2\u20133 weeks after prime vaccination (Cavanagh, 2003). Given the nature of these live attenuated vaccines, further passage beyond the master seed stock must be kept to a minimum to prevent potential loss of immunogenicity. The stocks must be grown in SPF chicken eggs to prevent the introduction of other potential pathogens (OIE, 2013).",

Though live attenuated vaccines are still common in the field, these vaccines provide only a little or partial cross-protection occurs between vaccine strains and new field which require the development of new vaccines as the recombinant vaccines. There is no doubt that newer generation vaccines such as the recombinant vector DNA vaccines, plasmid DNA vaccines, and multiepitope vaccines may stand as future alternatives as these vaccines have potential to deliver numerous antigens, thus producing broad-based antibody and cell-mediated immune response against numerous serotypes and also, the requirement of new strategies for vaccination.",
