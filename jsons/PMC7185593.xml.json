Microarrays are promising alternatives which surpass the potential of sequencing since they can detect thousands of genes in parallel. Further development of this technology is still underway, particularly in the area of improving the hybridization efficiency of immobilized DNA probes with their sample targets. The current research efforts are rooted on the understanding that the hybridization efficiency directly indicates the success of the experimental design and further data interpretation.",

The combination measurement of height and elastic compressibility of ss-DNA was verified an effective approach to detect the hybridization of nanostructured DNA (Mirmomtaz et al., 2008). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy is an in situ label-free optical method to dynamically detect the hybridization efficiency in the measurement of total-refraction angles (Peterson et al., 2001). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is another potential tool to measure DNA hybridization efficiency by its detection on the phosphorus elemental composition, which specifically exists in a DNA strand (Liu et al., 2009). The gold nanoparticles provide an advantage of rapid visual detection on DNA hybridization, but its applications are confined due to the lack of signal dynamic ranges (Mao et al., 2009). The fluorescence labeling is still the traditional and popular methodology due to its convenient interpretation and excellent dynamic range of signal intensity, which is supposed to measure in proportion by one-fluorescent dye corresponding to one DNA molecule (McQuain et al., 2004, Peytavi et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In this study, we conducted a very direct investigation on a realistic system of gene targets. Their probes were immobilized on planar slides with two reverse sequential blocks. We designed three sets of targets, with each set having one plant and one human gene. These two quite distinct species were selected to ensure the minimum opportunity for cross-hybridization between each other. Each set of targets hybridized onto the sequential blocks of their shared probes in a coaxial stacking configuration, i.e. hybridizing immediately next to each other along the continuous complement probe strand, as shown in Fig. 1\n. The relatively reverse sequential blocks on two probes indicate the steric effect of hybridization position. Another parameter investigated was the relative size of pre-hybridization target to its up-coming stacking neighbor. Three pairs of plant/human gene targets were selected to address this issue in relative sizes of 528mer/1027mer, 690mer/313mer, and 1020mer/432mer. The hybridization efficiency was investigated by comparing the individual hybridization schemes with the stacking ones based on the detection signals of the labeling dyes. This provides further understanding for what conditions of the pre-hybridization of a gene target enhance the hybridization efficiency of next target coupling onto the same probe.",

It was the first plant genome to be sequenced and now becomes popular as a model organism in plant biology and genetics (Lorkovic, 2009, Sandoval et al., 2008). Three genetic sections of this plant were cloned and notated as pda13015 (528b), pda06175 (690b), and pda06122 (1020b). Their final PCR products were labeled with Cy5 fluorescent dye to serve as the genetic targets. The second species is human gene in total RNA, and its PCR products include ATP5O (313b), PSMA5 (432b), and CANX (1027b) and labeled with Cy3 dye as targets. ATP5O was known functioned as a human ATP synthase and CANX a homo sapiens calnexin. ATP5O is the most significantly reduced gene involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Mootha et al., 2003), which was reported in parallel with increased insulin resistance in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (Sreekumar et al., 2002) CANX is a molecular chaperone found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for proper protein folding. Correct protein assembly in the membrane is supported by CANX, which retains intermediate structures in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to ternary complex formation completion (Takizawa et al., 2004). As for the human PSMA5, very little is known about its function and self-aggregation up to now. A recent report indicated that it exists mainly as tetramer (Han et al., 2004). The corresponding information of all genetic targets can be found from Table 1\n.",

Fig. 4a shows the result for hybridization location close to the slide surface, while Fig. 4b is close to the top free solution phase. Cy3-labeled ATP5O (313b), PSMA5 (432b), and CANX (1027b) served as the model genes individually hybridizing with two sequence-inversed probes. Readers can refer to the corresponding hybridization configurations in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. Comparing Fig. 4a with b indicates that a hybridization location close to the slide surface generally provided better hybridization efficiency than a location close to the free solution, except for ATP5O at high probe concentration. Hybridization at the location close to the free solution above the probe could be easier than that close to the slide surface to allow the shacked wash buffer to wash off the hybridized gene targets. As ATP5O hybridized with probe a_1, the signal intensity increased first but then decreased with probe concentration increasing. Although a recent report did not concur that the probe density alone is responsible for the low hybridization efficiency (Mirmomtaz et al., 2008), this parabolic profile is generally explained as the steric hindrance effect caused by a dense probe microarray (Herne and Tarlov, 1997, Peterson et al., 2001) since a dense microarray is believed to reduce the accessibility of free-phase DNA target to the immobilized probe. Its typical profile of measured intensity usually increases first and then drops as the microarrayed probe concentration increases.",

CANX was designed to individually hybridize with the probe or to stack together with the pre-hybridized pda13015 (528b) on the coaxial shared probe. Their corresponding hybridization configurations are shown in Fig. 6c and d. It can be concluded that the stacked configuration clearly received a signal enhancement by the pre-hybridization of pda13015. The enhancement contribution to the overall signal was roughly half fold on probe_1 and 1\u20133 folds on probe_2. However, this enhancement phenomenon was not observed at high probe concentrations due to the steric effect mentioned above. One possible explanation for this signal enhancement could be that the void space around the probe's bare sections was propped open by the pre-hybridized pda13015, and this void space could facilitate the subsequent CANX docking onto its binding site in the restricted environment. Another reasonable explanation could be the change of probe conformation. The pre-hybridization of pda13015 could cause the tilt probe to stand up, particularly probe_2, where the pre-hybridization occurred in the stem section. The standing conformation of an immobilized probe generally provides better contact with approaching targets than tilted or lying probes (Kaufmann et al., 2008).",

In other words, if CANX was added prior to pda13015, could pda13015 receive a similar benefit? Fig. 7 shows the related experimental design and results. The results, however, did not show the expected phenomenon, than moreover, no signal was observed on the stacked configuration. There are two factors that could be responsible: a long-size pre-hybridization of CANX (1027b) and/or a short hybridization section (17mer) of pda13015. In other words, the pre-hybridization of CANX (1027b) could hinder the accessibility of pda13015 (528b) to its complementary probe and/or the section of 17-mer was too short to retain the hybridized complex. The un-hybridized section of CANX hung around the hybridized probe and generated a steric hindrance to pad13015 to access the same probe. The 17-mer short section of pda13015 could be denaturalized by continues washes. In order to clarify the first issue, a further investigation was conducted on the stacking configuration of ATP5O(313b)\u2013pda06175(690b). However, the pre-hybridization of smaller size of ATP5O still caused no signal observed of pda06175 (data not shown). Thus, the signal enhancement by pre-hybridization would not be observed if the gene target designed to receive the benefit was hybridizing in a short section with its probe.",

Their corresponding pre-hybridizers were pda13015(528b), pda06175(690b), and pda06122(1020b), respectively. For the first pair, CANX was about twice the size of its pre-hybridizer.

The hybridization efficiency was observed to decrease with increasing probe concentration for a short gene target. This steric effect occurred only when the target was individually hybridized at a location close to the substrate surface. The DNA pre-hybridization greatly enhanced the hybridization efficiency of the subsequent gene target hybridizing onto the coaxial shared probe when a gene target had a large hybridization section and was larger than its pre-hybridization partner. Although a complete experimental design is necessary to obtain more firm conclusions, our results imply that an appropriate design for pre-hybridization of probes can enhance the DNA hybridization efficiency on microarrayed gene chips. This should be useful for optimal experiment design.",
