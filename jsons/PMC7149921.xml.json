Yet in the quarter of a century between 1967 and 1992 more than 30 previously unrecognized pathogens were discovered as the etiologic agents of human infectious diseases (Table 15.1\n). Some of the diseases were well characterized, but the causes had been unknown. Other novel syndromes were recognized and the etiologic agents identified including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nevertheless, the general belief was that infectious diseases were less important than cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and they were not favored for research support and public health attention.",

The emergence of at least 16 novel infectious agents over the following 12 years (Table 15.2\n) emphasized that this phenomenon would be a continued series of events. The causes of awareness of the presence of an unknown pathogen are the abrupt onset of a cluster of severe illness (eg, Legionella pneumonia at a convention of the American Legion), recognition of distinct gross or microscopic pathologic lesions (eg, pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile), and clinical laboratory microscopy (eg, intramonocytic inclusions of Ehrlichia chaffeensis in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis). In numerous other instances application of an advanced technologic method identified the etiology of a well-defined syndrome (eg, noroviruses in Norwalk diarrheal illness; an outbreak had occurred and samples retained from years earlier).",

After the discoveries of hepatitis A and B viruses, it was clear that the majority of cases of posttransfusion hepatitis were due to a condition designated non-A non-B hepatitis. The disease was transmissible to chimpanzees. In 1989, plasma from an infected chimpanzee was pelleted by ultracentrifugation and nucleic acids extracted from the pellet. cDNA was synthesized from both RNA and DNA with random primers and reverse transcriptase. Screening identified an RNA-encoded clone that expressed an antigen that reacted with antibodies of infected subjects. Eventually the complete genomes of all of the genotypes of HCV were determined, and a novel species most closely related to flaviviruses was established [12], [13].",

A mysterious highly lethal respiratory illness was investigated by a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Extensive serologic screening of numerous antigens revealed unexpected reactivity with antigen of hantaviruses from other parts of the world that caused renal disease and hemorrhagic fever, and immunohistochemistry detected hantaviral antigen in pulmonary endothelium. Regions within the M segment of the RNA hantaviral genomes encoding G2 protein that are highly conserved were targeted by primers for nested PCR after reverse transcriptase generation of cDNA. Tissues from infected patients were analyzed, and the PCR products sequenced revealing a novel hantavirus subsequently named Sin Nombre virus. Viral sequences were identified in other patients and in Peromyscus maniculatus rodents, the reservoir. The story of hantaviral pulmonary syndrome unfolded to reveal related agents in many locations in North, Central, and South America [14], [15].",

No further cases have been reported since July 2003 [16]. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing contributed to identification of the SARS-CoV within weeks of the first cases reported in 2003 [17], [18], [19], [20] and enabled rapid development of effective molecular diagnostic assays for routine clinical use [21], [22]. SARS-CoV is associated with high mortality. Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis is needed to prevent the spread of this contagious disease. SARS-CoV spreads by respiratory secretions and airborne transmission. Early in the illness, SARS cannot be distinguished from common respiratory infections based on clinical symptoms [16]. During the SARS epidemic, PCR-based molecular testing was helpful because of its ability to rapidly screen for many viruses. After the identification of SARS-CoV, specific RT-PCR and serological assays were developed, and RT-PCR detected infection before the appearance of antibodies when the risk of transmission is greatest [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].",

David Relman crafted this tool into an approach to identify an unknown etiologic agent by PCR of the rrs gene with primers that corresponded to genomic regions that were conserved among eubacteria. Using this approach, he amplified and determined bacterial DNA sequences from bacillary angiomatosis lesions of patients with AIDS. Comparison with a bacterial gene database revealed that the DNA sequences matched bacteria that are currently named Bartonella henselae and B. quintana. Serendipitous testing of a patient who also had been diagnosed with cat scratch disease led to the recognition that B. henselae was also the long sought-after etiology of this well-characterized disease [23], [24].",

Xue-Jie Yu investigated an outbreak in China that was thought to be due to severe infection with A. phagocytophilum. He noted that some of the clinical manifestations differed from those of anaplasmosis. He observed cytopathic effect in DH-82 cells inoculated with clinical samples rather than the typical morulae formed by Anaplasma species in infected cells. Ultrastructural analysis suggested that the pathogen causing the outbreak was a virus that belongs to the family of bunyaviruses. Based on the known sequence of bunyaviruses, PCR primers were designed, which yielded no amplicons. Subsequently, he began sequencing the RNA of heavily infected cells and discarded the sequences of the culture host species, Canis familiaris. This approach enabled him to determine that he had recovered a novel Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. He accomplished this feat without the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) [10]. The application of NGS now allows us to obtain an abundance of viral gene sequences from infected host cells and the discovery of further novel viral and bacterial agents.",

HIV-1 can cause AIDS, a chronic disease leading to immunodeficiency and susceptibility to opportunistic infections (http://www.who.int/hiv/en/). Three groups of HIV-1 have been identified based on sequence similarity, including M (main), O (outlier), and N (non-M/non-O) (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Of the three groups of HIV-1, group M dominates the global epidemic and is further classified into subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, and K. In addition, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), mosaic viruses formed between subtypes during co- or super-infection, have also been recognized (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Although subtype B is predominant in North America and Europe, non-B variants represent more than 90% of HIV-1 circulating globally [71]. In recent years, the prevalence of non-B subtypes and CRFs in the United States is steadily increasing due to increased international travel and immigration [72], [73], [74]. Sequencing data of HIV-1 genomes have been used for tracking HIV epidemics and for the design of accurate viral detection, viral load, and HIV-1 drug-resistance genotype assays to guide clinical use of antiretroviral treatment [38], [75]. The recent availability of the NGS approach has greatly facilitated generation of HIV-1 sequences and detection of quasispecies, which can improve understanding of HV-1 infection, pathogenesis, and epidemics [38], [76], [77].",

            "text": "Many methods have been employed for the clinical diagnostics of emerging pathogens including microscopy, bacterial culture, cell culture, and serologic tests. However, each of these methods has its own limitations that must be considered by the clinical laboratory. For example, even though cell culture could be considered as the gold standard in diagnosis of infection with emerging obligate intracellular bacteria such as Rickettsia or Ehrlichia, the requirement for biological safety laboratory level 3 (BSL-3) (for Rickettsia) or BSL-2 (for Ehrlichia) makes this test difficult to implement in many conventional clinical microbiology laboratories. Further, the prolonged turnaround time (TAT) (eg, detection by culture at 7\u201310 days after sample processing) makes this approach impractical. Results from such a test are not clinically useful due to failure to guide therapy during the early stages of infection when appropriate antibiotic treatment is highly effective. Similar to culture, serologic tests such as indirect immunofluorescence assays, which rely on detection of antigen-specific antibodies, have several limitations such as low sensitivity during the early stages of infection when there is a low level of specific antibodies and false-positive results due to cross-reaction of antibodies to antigens from closely-related bacterial species. In addition, diagnosis of acute infection by IgG serology using single or paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples has the limitation of lack of a standardized cutoff titer among laboratories if a single sample is obtained, or the frequent inability to obtain convalescent serum when paired samples are required. In the latter case, while IgG serology could be useful for epidemiologic surveillance, paired sera are not optimal for timely diagnosis and treatment of acute infection. Thus, the emergence of molecular methods including probe hybridization, target or signal amplification, and sequencing provides better diagnostic advantages compared to microscopy, culture, and serology such as rapid TAT, higher sensitivity and higher specificity in different patient populations, and using different specimen types (eg, blood, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, tissues, fluids). These molecular tests have become the gold standards due to their high negative and positive predictive values and their ability to detect and characterize newly emerging pathogens for clinical purposes [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

Several practice guidelines have incorporated HIV-1 and HCV molecular tests (eg, http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/en/; http://www.hcvguidelines.org/full-report-view). For example, because detection of HCV RNA, not IgG antibody, is diagnostic of current HCV infection, and HCV genotype 1 is more difficult to treat than genotype 2 or 3, testing for HCV genotype is recommended to guide selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen. HCV RNA detection and genotyping assays are routinely performed in clinical diagnostics laboratories (http://www.hcvguidelines.org/full-report-view). Over the years, with advances in molecular technology, HIV-1 and HCV clinical molecular tests have improved significantly with respect to performance characteristics including sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range. Currently, there are several FDA-approved/cleared molecular tests for HIV-1 and HCV (Table 15.1), and new methods are continuously developed and evaluated for better care of patients with HIV-1 and HCV infection [38], [75], [89], [93].",

In contrast, patients with HME often have not developed antibodies to the etiologic agent, E. chaffeensis, at the time when they present for medical attention. The bacteria can infect mononuclear phagocytes and are present in circulating monocytes providing an often effective target for molecular diagnostics at a time when appropriate antibiotic treatment results in rapid recovery from an otherwise life-threatening infection [29]. Yet HME, which likely has an incidence similar to Lyme disease, lacks a readily available point-of-care diagnostic test. Effective molecular target genes have been identified, and in-house assays provide proof-of-concept that molecular diagnostics offer an effective approach [28], [95]. Moreover, low-cost instrument-free devices for nucleic acid amplification and specific identification have been developed that would be appropriate for point-of-care diagnosis.",

For Lyme borreliosis, molecular diagnostics may not possess the solution when too few or no Borrelia are present. For HME, the issues lie in the realms of clinical practice, public health, and business. Physicians who are unaware of HME and note that febrile illnesses during the tick season often respond to doxycycline therapy are not inclined to order send out tests that would cost the patient. Serology that is based on comparing IgG antibody levels in paired sera often fails to provide a diagnosis of acute infection as it relies on the seldom-obtained convalescent serum. Public health agencies are powerless to address effectively a disease that is not diagnosed, and if diagnosed, is not reported. The epidemiologic reports depend on the data obtained by passive surveillance. In fact, active, prospective, population-based surveillance in endemic regions such as Missouri suggested that HME is a highly prevalent disease [96]. The combination of nonspecific clinical manifestations of HME, test underutilization, lack of a gold standard test that is effective when therapeutic decisions are made, and problems in interpretation of diagnostic tests such as serology, and misleading epidemiologic data have accounted for reported low incidence of HME. This situation has failed to stimulate interest in commercial development and marketing of a useful point-of-care assay, although there could be an adequate pull from the potential users of the test.",

For example, the availability of various sequence databases permits quick identification of sequence identity and variations. For example, the HIV database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ contains data on HIV genetic sequences and drug resistance associated mutations. It is valuable for HIV epidemiological studies, research, development, and clinical validation studies of HIV clinical assays [38], [71]. It is well known that there are significant variations of clinical phenotypes in the presence of emerging infections ranging from asymptomatic carrier to lethal infection. Recently, assays to examine multiple pathogen panels have been developed [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], which should increase the diagnostic yield for many pathogens. A critical need for emerging pathogen analysis is quicker, easier, cost-effect assays that can be used in a point-of-care setting. New assays that are performed on platforms with a small footprint and detect pathogens quickly (in minutes instead of hours or days) have entered clinical use. For example, the FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) and Simplexa (Focus Diagnostics, Inc.) molecular assays can generate results in approximately 60 min. The user-friendly Alere i (Alere Inc.) and Cobas Liat (Roche Molecular Systems) platforms are compact and portable, generate rapid molecular results in 15\u201320 min, can use electricity or rechargeable battery, and therefore are completely mobile and suited for point-of-care testing.

In the setting of emerging infectious diseases, rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is critical to facilitate effective patient management and enable prompt initiation of infection controls. Point-of-care assays are especially needed in resource-limited settings and in situations with lack of access to centralized medical facilities. Further development of point-of-care molecular tests for emerging pathogens is critical to timely diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent control of emerging infectious disease.",
