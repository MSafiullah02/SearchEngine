The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. The GC-MS/GC-FID was used for determination of essential oil composition. The antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH radical scavenging assay and reducing power. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the broth microdilution method against six enteropathogens bacteria isolated from diarrhea of young calves. The results of the study revealed an average yield of the essential oil of 11.6% \u00b1 0.97 (w/w). About 65 components were identified and quantified. Eugenol was the major compound of the studied essential oil (78.72%) followed by \u03b2-caryophyllene (8.82%) and eugenyl acetate (8.74%). The antioxidant activity by DPPH assay showed IC50 value of 4.82 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00b5g/mL, while the reducing power assay have resulted an EC50 value of 3.47 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00b5g/mL. The results showed that the essential oil exhibited an MIC at 1.36 mg/mL to 2.72 mg/ml and MBC at 5.45 mg/mL to 10.9 mg/mL against all tested bacteria. The present investigation revealed that Syzygium aromaticum essential oil exhibited a good in-vitro antioxidant and moderate in-vitro antibacterial activities.",

After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added to the mixture followed by a centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The upper layer (1 mL) was mixed with 1 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of ferric chloride (0.1%). The absorbance of the obtained solution was measured at 700 nm. A higher absorbance indicates a higher reducing power. Reducing power assay of the sample was expressed by EC50 value. The EC50 value was the effective concentration at which the absorbance was 0.5 and was obtained by interpolation from regression analysis. All tests were carried out in triplicate.

It also acts against various bacterial enzymes, including ATPase, histidine carboxylase. Moreover, eugenol demonstrated the disintegrating capability in the membrane [42] . This alteration results from the denaturation of the proteins by eugenol and the reaction of this compound with the cell membrane phospholipids changing their permeability [21] and the increase of this causes death of the organism [42] .",

S. aromaticum essential oil exhibited good in vitro antibacterial activity towards the clinical isolates of neonatal calves diarrhea. Ayoola et al.[23] have reported a low MIC (0.23 mg/mL) has been necessary for stopping the growth of E. coli ATCC35218. Likewise, Alitonou et al.[24] showed a lower value of MIC of S. aromaticum essential oil against E. coli ATCC 25922, with concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. However, Prabuseenivasan et al.[39] reported a higher concentration (> 1.6 mg/mL) for inhibits the growth of E. coli. Nevertheless, Ayoola et al.[23] cited a MIC of 1.6 mg/mL against an isolate of E. coli. On the other hand Naveed et al. [40] mentioned a higher concentration (5.4 \u00b1 1.08 mg/mL) against E. coli SS1. Previous studies have reported MICs of 0.2% (w/v) against E. coli, S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium",
