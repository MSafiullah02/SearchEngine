In the United States, CAP is the most frequent cause of death resulting from infectious diseases and is the eighth leading cause of death overall. The mortality rate of patients treated on an outpatient basis is <1%; for those who require admission to the hospital, it averages 12% but increases to 30% to 40% for those with severe CAP who require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall rate of CAP ranges from 8 to 15 per 1000 persons per year; the highest rates are at the extremes of age. More cases occur during the winter months. The economic cost exceeds $17 billion a year.",

CA-MRSA is more virulent than the traditional nosocomial MRSA strains, and strains of CA-MRSA tend to be more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than hospital-acquired MRSA strains. The majority of CA-MRSA strains contain a novel type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) gene and also carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, which produce toxins that create lytic pores in cell membranes of neutrophils, inducing release of chemotactic factors that promote inflammation and tissue destruction. Such patients often have necrotizing pneumonia and abscesses (see Figure 26-2). Although PVL toxins may be a highly linked epidemiologic marker for CA-MRSA strains, it remains unclear whether PVL is the major virulence determinant of CA-MRSA.",

The advantages of not admitting patients for treatment of CAP include decreased cost, patient preference, and avoidance of iatrogenic complications in the hospital. For elderly patients, particularly, a reduction in time in a hospital bed can facilitate better convalescence. Hospitalization should be considered when (1) patients have preexisting conditions that may compromise the safety of home care, (2) patients have hypoxemia, (3) patients are unable to take oral medications, or (4) psychosocial factors can potentially influence effective treatment (such as an unstable home environment or psychiatric disorders that may hinder adherence to therapy).

If, for example, an appropriate culture reveals the isolation of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, therapy can be specified by selecting a narrow-spectrum agent (such as penicillin or amoxicillin). This will hopefully reduce the selective pressure for resistance. This information is often available at the time of switch from parenteral to oral therapy and may be used to direct specific antimicrobial choices.Box 26-3Recommended Empirical Antibiotics for Community-Acquired PneumoniaOutpatient Treatment\n1Previously healthy and no use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months:\u2022A macrolide\u2022Doxycycline\n2Presence of comorbidities or use of antimicrobials within the previous 3 months (in which case an alternative from a different class should be selected):\u2022Respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin [750 mg])\u2022\u03b2-Lactam plus a macrolide\n3In regions with a high rate (>25%) of high-level (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] \u226516 mcg/mL) macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, consider use of alternative agents listed above in 2 for patients without comorbidities.\nInpatients, Non\u2013Intensive Care Unit Treatment\n\u2022Respiratory fluoroquinolone\u2022\u03b2-Lactam plus a macrolide\nInpatients, Intensive Care Unit Treatment\n\u2022A \u03b2-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam) plus either azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (for patients allergic to penicillin, a respiratory fluoroquinolone and aztreonam are recommended).\nSpecial Concerns\n1If Pseudomonas is a consideration (risk factors include bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with frequent antimicrobial or steroid use):\u2022An antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem) plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750-mg dose)\u2022The above \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin\u2022The above \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (for patients allergic to penicillin, substitute aztreonam for above \u03b2-lactam)\n2If community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a consideration, add linezolid or vancomycin.\nAdapted from Mandell LA, Wunderink RG, Anzueto A, et al: Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults, Clin Infect Dis 44(suppl 2):S27-S72, 2007.",

The most common causes of treatment failure are lack of or delayed response by the host despite appropriate antibiotics and infection with an organism that is not covered by the initial antibiotic regimen.

Chemoprophylaxis (i.e., oseltamivir or zanamivir), can be used as an adjunct to influenza vaccination. Clinicians should also intervene to modify some of the associated risk factors for pneumonia in adults. Because smoking is a significant risk factor for CAP, smoking cessation should be attempted; this is particularly important and relevant when patients are hospitalized for pneumonia. In addition, stabilization of underlying conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure, diabetes) and promotion of appropriate nutrition may help to reduce the risk of CAP and thereby promote longer and healthier lives.",
