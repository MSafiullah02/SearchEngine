            "text": "Probiotic Bacillales are effective in controlling pathogens. Live probiotic bacteria improve the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, leading to a reduction in pathogen colonization. However, it remains largely unknown how probiotics regulate the host's immunologic responses and protect the host from parasitic infection. In this study, we addressed whether Bacillales were effective against Haemonchus contortus, a parasitic nematode that infects small ruminants worldwide. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that Bacillales were largely depleted in the abomasal microbiota of sheep infected with H. contortus. We constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis named rBS CotB-HcG that express the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of H. contortus (HcGAPDH) on its spore surface using the Bacillus subtilis spore coat protein B (CotB) as a carrier. Mice receiving rBS CotB-HcG orally showed strong Th1-dominated immune responses. More importantly, sheep administered BS CotB-HcG per os showed increasing proliferation of the peripheral blood mononucleates, elevated anti-HcGAPDH IgG in sera, and higher anti-HcGAPDH sIgA in the intestinal mucus than the control sheep. The average weight gain of H. contortusinfected sheep treated with rBS CotB-HcG (Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG ) was 48.73% greater than that of unvaccinated sheep. Furthermore, these Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG sheep had fewer eggs per gram of feces by 84.1% and adult worms by 71.5%. They also demonstrated greatly lessened abomasal damage by H. contortus with an abundance of probiotic species in the abomasal microbiota. Collectively, our data unequivocally demonstrate the protective roles of CotB-HcGAPDH-expressing B. subtilis spores in against H. contortus infection and showed great potential of using probiotic-based strategy in controlling parasitic nematodes of socioeconomic importance in general. IMPORTANCE Initial analyses of the abomasal microbiota of sheep using 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that probiotic bacteria played a protective role in against H. contortus infection. A recombinant Bacillus subtilis expressing a fusion protein CotB-HcGAPDH on its spore's surface induced strong Th1 immune response in a murine model. The same probiotic recombinant, upon only one oral application, protected sheep against H. contortus infection by reducing egg shedding and decreasing adult worm loads of the parasite and increasing body weight gain of infected sheep. Both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were evident in these immunized sheep.",

To investigate the effect of microbiota on H. contortus infection, we analyzed abomasal microbiota of H. contortus-infected sheep using 16S rRNA (rRNA) sequencing. In the control sheep without H. contortus infection, the abomasal microbiota were dominated by the following bacterial classes: Alteromonadales (35.5%), Pseudomonadales (29.5%), Bacteroidales (10.4%), Clostridiales (9.8%), Flavobacteriales (3.4%), Enterobacteriales (1.9%), Bacillales (1.3%), and Aeromonadales (1.0%) (Fig. 1a) . H. contortus infection induced dramatic changes in microbial abundance, including those of Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, Sphingobacteriales, Enterobacteriales, Bacillales, and Coriobacteriales, compared to the uninfected group (Fig. 1a) . Of particular interest were the Bacillales bacteria that had probiotic effects in relation to H. contortus infection. The relative abundance of Bacillales was significantly reduced upon H. contortus infection ( Fig. 1b and c) (P \u03fd 0.005). It was further shown by linear effect size (LEfSe) analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences that Bacillales was the main contributor as a probiotic in the abomasal microbiota to protect sheep from H. contortus infection (Fig. 1d) . Together, these data demonstrated that sheep with H. contortus infection have significant reductions in Bacillales levels in the abomasum, suggesting a potential protective role of these probiotic bacteria in against nematodes and possibly other pathogenic infection.",

First, the full-length cDNA of HcGAPDH was cloned into the pET32a vector (pET32a-HcGAPDH), followed by the expression and purification of the recombinant HcGAPDH protein (Fig. 2b and c) . The purified protein was then used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. Second, the CotB and HcGAPDH genes were fused in order and cloned into the pDG364 vector (pDG364-CotB-HcGAPDH).

Flow cytometry assay further confirmed that 86.01% of the rBS CotB-HcG spores expressed CotB-HcGAPDH 72 h after induction (Fig. 3b) . No differences between wild-type (WT) and rBS CotB-HcG strains were observed in the production and germination of spores (Fig. 3c) . rBS CotB-HcG spores were further examined to determine whether expression of CotB-HcGAPDH affected spore structure by both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Again, no change was observed in the coat folds of elliptical spore morphology related to the wild type (Fig. 3d) . The exine and intine structures of rBS CotB-HcG were similar to those of the wild-type strain (Fig. 3e) . These results indicate that expression of the CotB-HcGAPDH fusion protein did not change the production and structure of B. subtilis spores.",

Lymphocytes prepared from the murine spleens were cultured and stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the purified HcGAPDH protein to determine the specific cell-mediated immune responses.

Similar results were obtained when the purified HcGAPDH protein was used as a stimulator (P \u03fd 0.05). Further, the anti-HcGAPDH immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in these murine sera were measured. The highest antibody level was detected in mice given rBS CotB-HcG (P \u03fd 0.005) at week 3 (Fig. 4c) . No anti-HcGAPDH antibody was detected in mice receiving PBS or the WT or rBS CotB strain (P \u03fe 0.05). The anti-HcGAPDH IgG2a level was 2.07 times higher than that of anti-HcGAPDH IgG1 (P \u03fd 0.005), indicating a Th1-dominated T cell immune response (Fig. 4d) . We next determined the levels of the secretory IgA (sIgA) to HcGAPDH in the intestinal epithelial cells and plasma cells. These were significantly higher in rBS CotB-HcG mice than in controls (P \u03fd 0.01) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from sheep were isolated on day 7 after infection, which is the time required for the infective L3 (iL3) of H. contortus to develop to the blood-sucking L4 stage in the abomasum. These cells were cultured and stimulated with ConA, LPS, or purified HcGAPDH protein. Consistent with the murine results, the proliferation of PBLs from the sheep receiving Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG in the presence of ConA or LPS was significantly greater than that from the Hc group (P \u03fd 0.005) (Fig. 5b) . The purified HcGAPDH protein also stimulated significant proliferation of PBLs from these sheep in comparison to control sheep (P \u03fd 0.005). The administration of rBS CotB-HcG induced anti-HcGAPDH IgG production (P \u03fd 0.005, compared to the Ctrl) at week 2, and the IgG level plateaued at week 4 until week 8 (Fig. 5c) . Meanwhile, anti-HcGAPDH IgG was not detectable in the control sheep. Further, anti-HcGAPDH sIgA levels were significantly higher in the intestinal mucus of Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG sheep than in that of the Hc sheep (P \u03fd 0.01) (Fig. S1 ). It was also found that genes representing Th1 activation (IFN-\u2425, IL-2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u2423]) and those of Th2 activation (IL-4 and transforming growth factor \u2424 [TGF-\u2424]) in PBLs of Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG sheep were highly activated (Fig. 5d) , even though the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 did not change (P \u03fe 0.05).

The WT B. subtilis spores also showed some degree of protection against body weight loss caused by H. contortus infection. In this case, 27.7% more body weight was recorded in the sheep receiving the WT B. subtilis spores than to the infected sheep without it (Fig. 7a ). Next, parasite load by egg per gram feces (EPG) and adult worm counting was determined. For sheep given 10 10 CFU of rBS CotB-HcG /animal, followed by H. contortus infection, the EPG levels dropped by 71.5% (Fig. 7b) , and the worm load dropped by an astonishing 84.1% compared to sheep infected with H. contortus alone ( Fig. 7c and Table 1 ). We also evaluated the infection by examining the abomasum. The abomasal surfaces of infected sheep were covered with worms and tracks of parasite crawling. The numbers of worms and parasite crawling tracks in the Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG sheep decreased compared to Hc group (Fig. 7d) . Furthermore, the abomasal mucosas of infected sheep showed intensive infiltration by mononucleates in comparison to the uninfected sheep. No apparent infiltration was observed in Hc\u03e9rBS CotB-HcG sheep (Fig. 7e) .

More importantly, the probiotic-based strategy of vaccination can alleviate the use of anthelmintics, thus reducing anthelmintic residues in food and milk and at the same time minimizing anthelmintic resistance of parasites. Antibodies in the mucus are the first line of host's defense against various pathogens, including parasites, invading the mucosa (17) (18) (19) by inhibiting the motility and adherence of the pathogens (20) . Both sIgA and IFN-\u2425 have powerful bactericidal effects in early infection (21) . However, whether oral administration is the best immunization strategy for H. contortus remains to be verified.",

            "text": "It has been shown that antigen delivery via bacterial spores produces a Th1-biased cellular response, as demonstrated by high levels of IgG2a (22) . IL-12 is a key cytokine that induces Th1-type immune response (15) . The transcription factor T-bet is a major regulator of Th1 cell polarization (23) . Significant upregulation of IL-12 and T-bet gene expression induced by rBS CotB-HcG indicated that B. subtilis spores mainly elicited Th1-type immune responses in a murine model. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the administration of rBS CotB-HcG in sheep induced Th2-type immune responses besides Th1, as shown by the upregulation of cytokine IL-4 and TGF-\u2424, implying that there may be mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses in sheep (24, 25) . A plausible explanation for this is that such mixed immune responses are jointly activated by spores and HcGAPDH antigenic protein. Alternatively, rBS CotB-HcG by proteolytic cleavage releases soluble antigens, including HcGAPDH, following their uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to presentation to a major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-restricted manner for the generation of Th2-type immune responses (26) . IL-4 is a signal cytokine for the Th2 response and is mainly responsible for the IgE isotype switch (27) . The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 is responsible for the inhibition of Th2 immune responses (28, 29) . In mice, a slight upregulation of cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and Th2-type transcription factors (GATA-3) was found, suggesting that rBS CotB-HcG could induce Th1/Th2 mixed immune responses. TGF-\u2424 manipulates various immune activities differentially in various cell types and potentially regulates a wide range of biological processes. In sheep, the mRNA levels of both TGF-\u2424 and IL-2 of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were increased. Some cytokines, particularly IFN-\u2425 and TGF-\u2424, have previously been proved to induce the upregulation of both MHC-I and MHC-II gene expression in different immune cells (30) , which then stimulates the production of antibodies and immune responses against parasitic pathogens (30) . Therefore, the upregulation of TGF-\u2424 gene expression in sheep receiving rBS CotB-HcG suggested that spores presenting HcGAPDH protein activate the host immune responses against parasitic infections by stimulating both MHC-I and MHC-II antigenpresenting pathways. Our results are consistent with an early study using different recombinant spores (31) .",

One plausible explanation is that sequencing-based approach is intended to detect taxonomic shifts at a level higher than the genus/species level. This is consistent with an earlier report (5) . Bacillus spp. are widely used as probiotics in the livestock industry lately. Currently, a few European Union-approved products are available in the market. The most notable one is BioPlus2B from Christian Hansen (32) . The probiotic B. subtilis emerges favorably as a vaccine carrier is because of its protective effects against a wide spectrum of pathogens (16, (33) (34) (35) . In addition, its spores possess adjuvant property due to a combination of antigens and the spore surface (36, 37) . Many Bacillus species are safe for sheep and can be used in sheep feeds (38) .

Our working hypothesis (Fig. 8) is that rBS CotB-HcG activates T helper lymphocytes by APCs and stimulates increasing the release of IL-2 that synergistically activates B lymphocytes to transform them into plasma cells. The latter generates anti-HcGAPDH IgG antibodies. The spores also stimulate intestinal epithelial cells and plasma cells to produce anti-HcGAPDH sIgA, which facilitates the proliferation of eosinophils and the upregulation of TGF-\u2424, resulting in parasite killing and clearance. HcGAPDH plays a key role in the inhibition of host complement activation. Antibody neutralization of HcGAPDH removes this inhibitor, leading to complement activation. Further, live H. contortus worms release HcGAPDH that is involved in evasion of the host immune system. Anti-HcGAPDH IgG and sIgA hence block the immune evasion of H. contortus.",

There were 20 mice in each group. The mice in all groups, including Ctrl mice, were originally immunized with three doses applied daily on three consecutive days, followed by two boosts at a 1-week interval. Each boost was administered the same way as the original immunization. Mice in the HcGAPDH group were each subcutaneously immunized with 200 g of purified HcGAPDH emulsified in the complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by two boosts with 100 g of HcGAPDH emulsified in the incomplete Freund's adjuvant 1 week apart. All mice were euthanized at week 5 after the last boosting. Lymphocytes were isolated from spleens and cultured for the extraction of total RNA. Thirty-six 6-month-old female sheep were assigned to six groups with six animals per group; each group was assigned control or individual treatment. Each group of sheep was kept in a separated pen housed indoors in the same building. All sheep were provided with food three times a day, with same quantity for each group, and water of the same source ad libitum.

The eggs per gram (EPG) value was assayed at 14 dpi according to the modified McMaster method (29) . The EPG reduction rate was calculated by: (average EPG in control -average EPG in treatment)/average EPG in control \u03eb 100%. The numbers of H. contortus adult worms from the abomasum in sheep were counted as described previously (40, 41) after euthanasia at week 11.
