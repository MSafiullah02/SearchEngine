            "text": "Kobuviruses are non-enveloped, polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses and represent a distinct genus in the family Picornaviridae. Based on their genomic organization and sequence similarities, kobuviruses are currently classified into 3 species, Aichivirus A (formerly Aichi virus), Aichivirus B (formerly Bovine kobuvirus) and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus) (Adams et al., 2013). Human Aichi virus (AiV) was first recognized in 1989 as the cause of oyster-associated nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans in Aichi Prefecture, Japan (Yamashita et al., 1991). Several investigations have subsequently revealed that AiVs are involved in 0.9\u20134.1% of sporadic cases of pediatric gastroenteritis (Ambert-Balay et al., 2008, Reuter et al., 2009b, Kaikkonen et al., 2010, Jonsson et al., 2012). Novel kobuviruses genetically closely related to human AiVs have been recently found in domestic and wild carnivores (Kapoor et al., 2011, Li et al., 2011, Carmona-Vicente et al., 2013, Chung et al., 2013, Di Martino et al., 2014a, Di Martino et al., 2014b). Carnivore kobuviruses were firstly discovered in diarrhoeic and asymptomatic dogs in USA (Kapoor et al., 2011, Li et al., 2011). Upon genome sequencing, canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) was found to be genetically closely related to mouse kobuvirus (MuKoV) (84.0% amino acid [aa] identity) (Phan et al., 2011) and to human AiV (80.0% aa identity). Subsequently, CaKoV-like RNA was detected in diarrhoeic cats in South Korea (Chung et al., 2013). The aa identity between CaKoVs and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV) in the full-length genome ranged from 82.0% to 86.0%, while aa identity to human AiV was 79.0% (Cho et al., 2014). Molecular investigations worldwide have revealed that CaKoVs are common in both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs (Kapoor et al., 2011, Li et al., 2011, Carmona-Vicente et al., 2013, Di Martino et al., 2013, Oem et al., 2014). By converse, there is no information on the epidemiology of the newly described FeKoVs after their initial description in Asia (Chung et al., 2013, Cho et al., 2014).",

The polyprotein comprised a leader protein (L), three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), and seven nonstructural proteins (2A to 2 C and 3A to 3D). The positions of the cleavage sites on the polyprotein were predicted by sequence alignments and NetPicoRNA analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPicoRNA). Likewise in other kobuviruses, the predicted cleavage sites were consistent with L/VP0, VP3/VP1, VP1/2A, 2A/2B, 2B/2 C, 2 C/3A, 3B/3 C and 3 C/3D sites, all which contained Q/G residues, but the VP0/VP3 and 3A/3B cleavage sites, which contained E/G and Q/A residues. The aa identity between strain TE/52/13/ITA and FK-13 in the P1 (853 aa), P2 (636 aa) and P3 (779 aa) regions was 98.0%, 100% and 98.0%, respectively.

Our results also provide further evidence that a distinct group of kobuviruses (i.e. FeKoVs) within Aichivirus A species, but with peculiar genetic signatures, circulates in cats. Accordingly, FeKoVs should be considered as common constituents of feline enteric viroma. In this study, FeKoVs were detected only in diarrhoeic animals, with a prevalence rate similar to that reported in South Korea (Chung et al., 2013). Some of the FeKoV-positive cats were also infected by other feline pathogens such as FPV or FECV. These findings were not unexpected, as mixed infections are not infrequent, chiefly in animal communities such as shelters. Although these results demonstrated that FeKoVs are common viruses of cats, it is not clear whether they also play a role as enteric pathogens. Large structured epidemiological studies and comprehensive characterization of FeKoV strains identified from other geographic areas and experimental infections might help clarify their global distribution, genetic heterogeneity and possible association with enteric diseases in cats.",
