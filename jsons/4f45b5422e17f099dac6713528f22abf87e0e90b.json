There have been numerous studies on the physiochemical characteristics and behavior of CPPs in various environments; likewise, the mechanisms of entry and delivery capabilities of these peptides have also been extensively researched. Besides the fundamental issues, there is an enormous interest in the delivery capabilities of the peptides as the family of CPPs is a promising and mostly nontoxic delivery vector candidate for numerous medical applications such as gene silencing, transgene delivery, and splice correction. Lately, however, there has been an emerging fi eld of study besides the high-profi le gene therapy applications-the use of peptides and CPPs to combat various infections caused by harmful bacteria, fungi, and viruses.",

The list of available CPPs has grown rapidly and CPPs have been employed for a variety of applications.

CPPs can interact with multiple cell surface molecules, including membrane lipids and membrane-associated proteoglycans [ 7 ] . CPPs can be taken up by cells via multiple pathways, such as direct translocation through the membrane bilayer or endocytosis-mediated uptake. Although molecules entering cells prefer the direct membrane translocation pathway, endocytosis, composed of two steps, endocytotic entry and endosomal escape, is the major cellular uptake pathway for most CPPs as most reports have pointed out [ 8 ] . Endocytosis occurs by various formats, which can be classifi ed into caveolae and/or lipid raft-mediated endocytosis [ 9 ] , micropinocytosis [ 10 ] , through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [ 11 ] or via a cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis [ 12 ] . The endocytosis pathway is proposed based on the fact that CPP uptake in cells was found to adopt an energydependent mechanism [ 13 ] . However, cellular uptake is not completely prohibited at low temperatures or in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors [ 13 ] , suggesting a non-energy consuming route. Recently, the fi nding of strong peptide-lipid interactions supports direct translocation of the peptides across the membrane [ 14 ] . In addition, many studies also propose cellular uptake can follow multiple routes depending on experimental conditions, specifi c CPP sequence, and the cargo structure [ 15 ] .",

Antimicrobial peptides, a major class of antibacterial agents, share amphiphilicity and cationic structural properties with cell-penetrating peptides. All AMPs known by the late-1990s are cationic. However, the concept that AMPs need to be cationic was changed later with the discovery of negatively charged AMPs in 1997 [ 16 ] . For example, maximin-H5 [ 17 ] discovered from frog skin and dermicidin [ 18 ] secreted from human sweat gland tissues are both anionic peptides. They also have a positive net charge, normally in the range of +4 to +6, which is due to the frequent presence of lysines and arginines in the amino acid sequence [ 19 ] . Additionally, nearly 50 % of their structure often consists of hydrophobic residues. They kill a broad spectrum of microbes including bacteria and fungi by destroying their cell membranes and are important components of the innate immune system of many animals and plants [ 20 ] .",

CPPs and AMPs are similar in the structural motif of amino acid composition, but differ in biological activities within the lipid membrane. Common to both groups are interactions of cell membrane components with the charged amino acid residues of the peptides. This is probably the fi rst step in cell association that leads to cellular uptake. Anionic phospholipids or phosphate groups of lipopolysaccharides (for gram-negative bacteria) or acidic polysaccharides, teichoic acids, and lipoteichoic acids (for gram-positive bacteria) are the membrane components at the cell surface responsible for generating an overall negative net charge, making the binding of positively charged or amphipathic peptides possible [ 21 ] . Furthermore, the lipid bilayer of bacterial membrane contains mainly lipids with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups, while fungi, in contrast, exhibit a zwitterionic lipid bilayer composition, upon which the uptake is driven by hydrophobic N-or C-terminus or particular amino acids of the peptide sequence, resulting in the accumulation of the peptide, which fi nally induces strong hydrophobic interaction to the membrane.",

The ratio between the cationic lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues infl uences membrane selectivity since the guanidino functionalities of arginines promote a more effi cient interaction with eukaryotic membranes as compared to lysine. This is, however, most often at the expense of increased cytotoxicity. A high Lys content has been correlated with selectivity toward bacterial cells over eukaryotic cells [ 22 ] . Furthermore, the ability of CPPs to permeate cell membranes appears to be directly linked to their propensity to fold into a welldefi ned secondary structure (\u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet) while interacting with biological membranes [ 23 ] . Likewise, the antimicrobial activity of \u03b1-helical AMPs depends on their propensity to form an \u03b1-helix [ 24 ] . The highly basic Arg guanidinium and Lys ammonium groups remain protonated under physiological pH conditions and thus can function as hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors in various protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. In lipid membranes, the guanidinium group in protein side chain can form a branched moiety by interacting with water and lipid molecules. In the past few years, many CPPs and AMPs have been extensively investigated to elucidate the structural basis of how these cationic macromolecules interact with membrane lipids and water [ 25 ] .",

HNP-1 belongs to the \u03b1-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides and is the mediator of the host innate immune response. Most AMPs adopt rigid amphipathic secondary structures, either \u03b1-helical or \u03b2-sheet [ 28 ] . The two CPPs, TAT and penetratin, are the fi rst two discovered and also most frequently applied CPPs [ 25 ] . They display a turn-rich conformation and random coil structure in lipid bilayers, respectively, suggesting that the absence of intra-or intermolecular H-bonded conformation and high molecular mobility may be the hallmarks of CPPs which differentiates them from AMPs. Due to the similar Arg-rich structural motif, CPPs and AMPs have strong Arg-lipid and Arg-water interactions, which stabilize these hydrophobic peptides by membrane neutralization and water solvation and thus facilitate the insertion. However, CPPs interact with the cellular membrane in a non-invasive manner, while AMPs function by disrupting the lipid membrane. In addition, CPPs also experience charge-charge interaction from the distal phosphate layer and the guanidinium-phosphate interactions stabilize the CPP peptides in lipids and facilitate the insertion, while the plastic conformation and high mobility further promote the translocation.",

From these results a model was proposed whereby buforin 2 molecules would form a toroidal pore, just as magainin 2 does, but less stable; this would result in shorter pore lifetimes-with a concomitant decrease in permeabilization-at the same time that the translocation rate would increase because pore disintegration, which is the actual translocation step, would become more frequent [ 29 , 30 ] . This model is supported by results that show that the presence of bilayer components that prevent the formation of toroidal pores (such as dioleyl phosphatidylethanolamine [ 31 ]) inhibit buforin 2 translocation, whereas anionic phospholipids, which decrease the charge repulsions between the cationic peptide molecules, stabilize the pore to a point that signifi cant leakage and fl ip-fl op is observed [ 30 ] . Buforin 2 translocation has also been shown to withstand cargo addition, as demonstrated by the attachment of green fl uorescent protein [ 32 ], which makes this peptide a promising candidate for its development into a CPP. A \"membrane-thinning\" effect was proposed for the AMP magainin 2 [ 33 ], in which the peptide aggregates on the surface of the membrane and the decreased local surface tension allows the peptide to intercalate the membrane.",

The groups of AMPs can be divided as: (a) antibacterials; (b) antivirals; (c) antifungals; (d) antiparasitics; and (e) anticancer peptides. AMPs kill bacteria by inhibiting some important pathways inside the cell such as DNA replication and protein synthesis [ 78 ] . Antiviral AMPs neutralize viruses by integrating in either the viral envelope or the host cell membrane. AMPs can integrate into viral envelopes and cause membrane instability, rendering the viruses unable to infect host cells [ 79 ] . AMPs can also reduce the binding of viruses to host cells [ 80 ] . Some of antifungal peptides are capable of binding to chitin. Such binding ability helps AMPs to target fungal cells effi ciently. Cell walltargeting antifungal AMPs kill the target cells by disrupting the integrity of fungal membranes by increasing permeabilization of the plasma membrane [ 81 ] , or by forming pores directly [ 82 ] . An example of antiparasitic peptide is cathelicidin, which is able to kill Caernohabditis elegans by forming pores in the cell membrane [ 83 ] . Even though some parasitic microorganisms are multicellular, the mode of action of antiparasitic peptides is the same as other AMPs. They kill cells by directly interacting with cell membrane [ 83 ] . Anticancer peptides are also known as host defense peptides. They unction by targeting the cell membrane, as to date, more than 100 host defense peptides are known.",

Although they possess the capability to replicate, viruses do not have a metabolism and they lack the means to produce energy like living things do with the help of mitochondria. Instead, they recognize host cells, after which the execution of gene expression, genome replication, and virion formation will take place [ 103 ] .

Furthermore, when the main focus of antibacterial, antifungal or even antitumor peptides is to neutralize the organism/cell that they have come to interact with, antiviral peptides must be capable of disabling the viral infection in such a way that the host cell would remain intact and operational, otherwise the host might be weakened by a great extent and, in worst cases, even suffer terminal organ failures.",

The reason for such naming is that they are composed either only or mainly of leucine (L) and lysine (K) residues. The key elements in achieving the enhanced antiviral effi ciency were once again the increased a-helicity and the amphipathic characteristics of the molecules, which further stresses the importance of these traits when developing antiviral CPPs. Some synthetic antiviral CPPs can also be a result of a lucky accident. While trying to improve the effi ciency of their CPP-PNA conjugate [ 110 ] by adding a fatty acid domain, they created a CPP, which was an effi cient antiviral agent even without the conjugated PNA. The infected cells treated with the peptide also demonstrated the tendency to release naked viral nucleocapsids that are extremely immunogenic, which could be used for vaccine-like immune system stimulation in the infected organism [ 111 ] .",

While the main approach of the study was the prophylactic treatment against HSV-1 on the surface of the cell, it was noted that the particle is possibly internalized, in which case it can be classifi ed as a CPP. This is further confi rmed by additional study, where G2 has been conjugated to acyclovir in order to increase its antiviral effi ciency [ 113 ] .

For example, pyrrhocoricin consists of 20 amino acids and is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from insects, being effective against gram-negative bacteria but almost inactive against grampositive strains [ 114 ] . Furthermore, pyrrhocoricin itself has been used as a drug delivery system. Otvos et al. investigated a modifi ed pyrrhocoricin dimer that could successfully deliver peptide antigens into dendritic cells and human fi broblasts [ 115 ] . Another example is the antimicrobial protein lactoferrin (hLF), the human milk protein, which is a very important protein in immune defense due to its antifungal, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [ 116 ] . The truncated version of this peptide consists of 49 amino acids and exhibits antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, and immunological activity [ 117 ] and was described to enter different cells efficiently (e.g. Hela or rat IEC-6). The uptake mechanism of the hLF peptide seems to be concentration-dependent and for concentration higher than 10 \u03bcM, rapid delivery into the cytoplasm and nucleus is observed. Furthermore, the uptake pathway was determined to be sensitive to rottlerin, a protein kinase inhibitor with specifi city for protein kinase C (PKC). This was also observed for the uptake of arginine-rich CPPs such as Tat and R9 [ 118 ] . The uptake effi ciency is supposed to be conformation-dependent, because the cyclic structure is required for binding to heparin sulfate and correlates with lipid-induced conformational changes. Several examples of effi cient cargo delivery have been described for the hLF peptide; especially proteins and high-molecular-weight complexes have been successfully transported [ 119 ] .",

It also belongs to the Pro/Arg-rich family and was described to be antimicrobially active against gramnegative bacteria in a micromolar range but not against grampositive strains [ 121 ] .

Their approach entailed fusing their protein to the polyarginine CPP R9, allowing to block Rep binding to its replication origin sequence [ 134 ] . Proteins such as Mx-1 have been used to inhibit VSV virus in combination with Tat peptide through the suppression of replication and capability to cure ongoing infections [ 135 ] . Hexa-arginine with a synthetic peptide mimicking a \u03b2-sheet/loop motif commonly found in the C-terminal domain of the Chandipura virus P protein binds the positive-sense leader RNA to inhibit virus replication [ 136 ] . Heat shock protein gp96 has been fused to Tatpeptide in an attempt to enhance T-cell-based immune responses. This led to increased antiviral and antitumor potency and to the inhibition of HBV in mice [ 137 ] . Protease-inhibiting peptides have been developed against HCV infection. These molecules were conjugated to a selection of CPPs and the fusion with Antennapedia was regarded as the approach with the highest effi ciency [ 138 ] . Peptide-targeting HIV-1 capsid formation has been successfully applied using a commercial CPP-based transfection reagent, Chariot. What makes this development especially interesting is that this is one of the rare occasions upon which the molecule of interest is not conjugated to the transfection peptide covalently but employs non-covalent bonding strategy instead [ 139 ] . The approach to target the capsid of the virus has also been used in HCV inhibition-the capsid has been targeted by R7 in fusion with nucleocapsid binding subunits. In addition to its inhibition of envelopment, the peptide conjugate also blocks the subsequent viral particle release [ 140 ] .",

PMOs have been utilized in an approach against murine hepatitis virus, which is a member of coronavirus family which holds such other, better known members, such as SARS. Various arginine-rich PPMO combinations were compared and it resulted in the selection of (R-Ahx-R) 4 AhxB-PPMO over R9F2C-PPMO and Tat-PPMO based on their delivery effi ciency in a splicecorrecting model system [ 142 ] and antiviral effi ciencies targeted against 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the viral genome [ 143 ] . The P007 CPP-conjugated PMO targeting the 3\u2032 region of the internal ribosomal entry site was shown to hold great potency against the coxsackievirus B3, a known cause for viral myocarditis, both in cell culture and in mice, showing a perspective for further therapeutic research [ 144 ] . PMOs in combination with arginine-rich CPPs, such as AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 have also been reported to be capable of inhibiting Ebola and Marburg viruses respectively. The main mechanism of action for these molecules is the inhibition of viral mRNA translation, which leads to the inhibition of the whole replication process [ 88 ] .",

While it may not be apparent at fi rst, there are possible applications present for almost any type of CPP when it comes to fundamental research. If to consider, for example, a CPP delivery vector that has been proven to have no effect whatsoever in regards to viral infection-replication cycle and also shows no considerable cytotoxic effects against the host cell, such as the CPP PepFect6 when combined with Semliki Forest Virus [ 145 ] , a member of alphavirus family, it opens up numerous possibilities to gain insight into the properties of the virus and about its behavior when some molecule of interest has been introduced into the environment. This lack of interference becomes especially important when taking into account the fact that other widely used transfection methods, such as electroporation [ 146 ] or lipofection [ 147 ] either damage the cells to a great extent or inhibit the infection and replication capabilities of viruses [ 145 ] , resulting in data about the virus that can be considered as unreliable.",

This approach, combined with the fact that some CPPs do not affect viruses, allows the conduction of research related to viral replication. If to introduce a CPP-drug conjugate into the cellular environment that completely inhibits late-stage virion formation, it could create a setting in which it is easier to observe viral replication without the need to create replicon models of the original virus, the downside of which is that while they do carry out the replication in a similar way",

Small molecule transport can be used to identify the various interactions that certain virus regions might have with the host cell.
