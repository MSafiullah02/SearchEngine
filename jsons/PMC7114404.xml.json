The disease causes significant economic loss worldwide and is one of the Office International des Epizooties listed notifiable diseases (Paton and Greiser-Wilke, 2003). CSFV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is classified in the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae, along with bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, and border disease virus (BDV) (Becher et al., 2003). The 12.5-kb CSFV genome contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 3898-amino-acid polyprotein and yields 12 final cleavage products: NH2-Npro-C-Erns-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4ANS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH through co- and post-translational processing of the polyprotein by cellular and viral proteases (Meyers et al., 1989, Meyers and Thiel, 1996, Thiel et al., 1991). The virion consists of four structural proteins, the capsid (C) protein and the glycoproteins Erns, E1, and E2 (Thiel et al., 1991).",

            "text": "The C protein of CSFV is located between the N-terminal protease Npro and the glycoprotein Erns in the polyprotein. The C protein is a small protein and rich in basic amino acids (lysine and arginine) (Meyers et al., 1989, Thiel et al., 1991). Mature C protein has 86 amino acids and its apparent molecular weight (MW) is 14 kDa (Heimann et al., 2006). The N terminus (169Ser) of the C protein is cleaved by autocatalysis of the Npro protein (Rumenapf et al., 1998, Stark et al., 1993). The C protein is followed by the Erns protein, of which N terminus (268Asp) is generated by the signal peptidase (SP) (Heimann et al., 2006, Stark et al., 1993). The C protein acts as a transcriptional regulator and plays an important role in the CSFV virion maturation (Liu et al., 1998a). Formation of a C protein\u2013RNA complex inside the virion suggests a protective function of the C protein (Meyers and Thiel, 1996, Thiel et al., 1991). Furthermore, C proteins may function in RNA structural rearrangements taking place during virus replication (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008) and RNA packaging and virion morphogenesis (Murray et al., 2008). To our knowledge, other potential functions of the C protein remain unknown.",

Also, the C protein may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infection (Major et al., 1995). To understand the functions of the C protein of CSFV and directly elucidate the mechanisms involved in CSFV replication, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) tool is needed. Availability of specific antibodies against the C protein of CSFV may facilitate further studies on viral replication and biosynthesis. To date, however, there is no report about the mAb against C protein. In this study, we expressed the C protein of CSFV in Escherichia coli and prepared a mAb against the C protein, and identified a linear epitope targeted by the mAb. In addition, the cellular localization of the C protein was analyzed.",

The spleen cells were fused with SP2/0 cells as described essentially by Kohler and Milstein (1975). The hybridoma cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing HAT and HT for 10\u201314 days. Further selection and characterization were carried out by the indirect ELISA based on the His-C protein as described previously (Peng et al., 2008). After three times of limiting dilution, the hybridoma cells of interest were propagated, suspended in serum-free medium, and then inoculated into the pristine-primed mice, from which ascetic fluids containing the mAb 3E8 (see below) against the C protein was collected 7\u201310 days post-inoculation (dpi). Reactivity and titer of the mAb were tested by Western blot and ELISA using the His-C protein. The IgG subtype analysis of the mAb was performed using a SBA Clonotyping System/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL, USA).",

Consequently, the mAb 3E8 provides a tool to analyze the function of the C protein in CSFV infection.

In this study, using the recombinant expression vector pEGFP-C1\u201399, the distribution of the C protein was investigated. We demonstrated that the C protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of transfected PK-15 cells (Fig. 6). This subcellular distribution of the C protein of CSFV is reasonable, for that as a structural protein inside the virion, the major population of the C protein should reside in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, in order to carry out the transcriptional regulation, the C protein may enter into the nucleus including the nucleolus, just as the localization of the nucleoprotein of avian coronavirus and bovine herpesvirus-1 infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) (Chen et al., 2002, Guo et al., 2009). Meanwhile, we detected the nucleolar localization of the C protein of CSFV using 3E8 in CSFV-infected PK-15 cells. However, no nucleolar localization of the C protein was observed in CSFV-infected cells. Possible explanations may be that successful detection of nucleolar proteins using antibodies can be related to the concentration of the protein within the nucleolus and the nucleolus is not always refractive to antibody staining (Sheval et al., 2005). In addition, charged proteins can also migrate through cells post-fixation and become localized to the nucleus (Lundberg and Johansson, 2001, Lundberg and Johansson, 2002). In a previous report, no nucleolar localization of SARS-CoV N protein was observed using anti-N antibody in infected cells (You et al., 2005).",

However, nuclear pore complexes allow the passive transport in both directions between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of ions, small molecules, and proteins with MW ranging from 40 to 60 kDa (Peters, 1986). Then the transport of larger proteins through the pore is an active process requiring ATP, and such proteins contain a NLS (Nigg et al., 1991, Richardson et al., 1988). The C protein of CSFV meets both criteria in that the C protein is less than 40 kDa in size and is predicated to contain a NLS (PESRKKL). Therefore, the C protein of CSFV might enter the nucleus via both passive and active pathways.",
