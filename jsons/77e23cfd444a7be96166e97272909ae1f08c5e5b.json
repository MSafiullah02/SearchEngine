Practically, this leads to several important questions. For example, which test or which subset of tests should be selected, taking into account the effectiveness of individual tests, synergies and redundancies between them, as well as their cost. How to produce an optimal decision rule on the basis of the data given, which typically consists of test results for patients with or without confirmed health condition. To address questions of this kind, we develop an approach that combines (semi-supervised) machine learning methodology with concepts from (cooperative) game theory. Roughly speaking, while the former is responsible for optimally combining single tests into decision rules, the latter is used to judge the influence and importance of individual tests as well as the interaction between them. Our approach is motivated and illustrated by a concrete case study in veterinary medicine, namely the diagnosis of a disease in cats called feline infectious peritonitis.",

Roughly speaking, the idea is that, by learning a model in which various candidate tests play the role of predictor variables, information about the usefulness of individual tests as well as their combination is provided by properties of that model. An approach of that kind has at least two important advantages: -First, it not only allows for judging the usefulness of single tests but also of combined tests, i.e., the combination of different tests into one overall (diagnostic) decision rule. Thus, it informs about possible synergies (as well as redundancies) between individual tests and the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy thanks to a suitable combination of these tests. -Second, going beyond the standard setting of supervised learning, a machine learning approach suggests various ways of improving the selection of tests by taking advantage of additional sources of information. An important special case is the use of semi-supervised learning to exploit \"unlabeled\" data coming from individuals for which tests have been made but the true health condition is unknown. This situation is highly relevant in medical practice, because tests can often be conducted quite easily, whereas determining the true health condition is very difficult or expensive.",

            "text": "Our approach is motivated by a concrete case study in veterinary medicine, namely the diagnosis of a disease in cats called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Complete certainty about whether or not a cat is FIP-positive, and eventually will die from the disease, requires a necropsy [1, 10] ; unfortunately, no test performed in a cat while still alive has a 100 % sensitivity or 100 % specificity. Consequently, while different tests can be applied to cats quite easily, \"labeling\" a cat in the sense of supervised learning is expensive, difficult and time-consuming. In addition to the use of (semi-supervised) machine learning methodology in medical diagnosis, we propose a game-theoretical approach for measuring the usefulness of individual tests as well as model-based combinations of such tests. Roughly speaking, the idea is to consider a combination of tests as a \"coalition\" in the sense of cooperative game theory, and the \"payoff\" of the coalition as the diagnostic accuracy achieved by the test combination. This approach will be detailed in the next section, prior to elaborating more closely on our case study in Sect. 3, presenting experimental results in Sect. 4 and concluding the paper in Sect. 5.",

The Pareto set, consisting of those combinations that are not outperformed by any other combination in terms of both accuracy and cost at the same time, is indicated as a blue line. From a practical point of view, the result suggests to use a single diagnostic test, namely RT-nPCR (blood or effusion), because the inclusion of more tests yields only minor improvements. This is confirmed by the pairwise interaction indices shown for both measures \u03bd \u2022 and \u03bd * in Table 1 . All these measures are negative, suggesting that the tests are more redundant than complementary. Note that, once a decision in favor of using a single test is made, the Shapley value, as a measure of average improvement achieved by adding a test, is no longer the best indicator of the usefulness of a test. Instead, a selection should be made based on the tests' individual performance. With a validated accuracy of 87 %, RT-nPCR (effusion) appears to be the best choice in this regard. ",
