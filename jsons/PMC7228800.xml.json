            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus responsible for COVID-19 is transmissible via aerosolization and may be viable in the air for at least three hours [1-2]. The increased need for aerosolizing procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, extubation, tracheostomy, cricothyrotomy, endoscopy, bronchoscopy, transesophageal echo (TEE), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV), such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bronchoscopy, combined with the shortage of negative pressure rooms has led to the rapid innovation of novel biohazard isolation hoods adapted to use wall suction to create a negative pressure environment for patients with COVID-19 [3-7]. While effective, these wall suctions systems have certain limitations, such as immobility, single patient use, and weaker suction capabilities. Here, we report the first use of the Stryker Neptune\u2122 (Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan) high-powered suction systems that are mobile-ready and available in most hospital operating rooms to more effectively create negative pressure biohazard isolation hoods so as to minimize risk to healthcare workers, performing aerosolization procedures on COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients. This novel negative pressure isolation biohazard hood has been utilized regularly in an anesthesia practice of 30+ providers and, to date, there have been no documented COVID-19 infections.",

After all tubing, canisters, regulators, and a Yankauer suction tip are attached, the effective flow rate is reduced to 47.6 liters per minute of air movement [9]. In contrast, the Stryker Neptune\u2122 generates significantly greater suction pressure, reaching maximum negative pressures of 520 mmHg per suction canister [10]. Thus, the air exchange rate and the efficiency of aerosolized particle removal is much greater with a Stryker Neptune\u2122 suction as compared to the wall suction. Furthermore, a single Stryker Neptune\u2122 suction system may be used to generate sufficient negative pressure for multiple patients.",
