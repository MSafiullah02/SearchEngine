So, we have to question ourselves as clinicians, if mobility tests should be used at all in our clinical reasoning, especially when we know that we should no longer look at PGP as a local biomechanical peripheral condition.",

Findings are presented of a well-known functional test; the Timed up and Go test in the PGP population (Yeminisihar et al, 2020).",

Meijer et al., (2020b) follow their historical journey with a \u2018deconstruction\u2019 that leads to a theory of PGP as a neuroinflammatory disorder. It provides conceptual links to comorbid mental health disorders that commonly accompany chronic PGP complaints. Similarly, Beales et al, (2020) also see neurological system sensitisation as a potential mechanism linking PGP to comorbid health complaints. Further, they provide clinicians with a road map of sorts for consideration of this with a person-centred approach to managing these disorders, described in the Masterclass of this special issue (Beales et al., 20202).",
