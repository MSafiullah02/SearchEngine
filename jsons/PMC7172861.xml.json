            "text": "The recent outbreak of Covid19 has required urgent treatments for numerous patients. The Covid19 originated in Wuhan, China has spread to other continents and has caused significant harm to the public. Fig. 1\nrepresents a transmission electron microscope image of Covid19 along with a 3D structure of coronavirus. No suitable vaccines or antiviral drugs exist against Covid19. At the time of writing (15 March 2020), Coronavirus cases were already 173,085 (+19 % over the last 24 h, +5% the day before), with 6664 deaths (+23 % over the last 24 h, +6% the day before) vs. 77,784 recovered (+6% over the last 24 h), with some improvements in China. However, the condition is deteriorating in Western Europe, especially Italy. No cure for Covid19 is known at this time. In addition to administering oxygen, current treatments recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the serious, critical cases of Covid19 include Remdesivir, Kaletra, and Kaletra plus Interferon (France24, \u201cConquering the coronavirus: the most pressing goal for these researchers in Paris\u201d, youtu.be/L0wRSKnIErk). Remdesivir is an antiviral nucleotide developed as a treatment for the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Kaletra is a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir (LPV/r). This is also used as antiviral nucleotide analogs developed for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The third option is a combination of Kaletra with Interferon. Interferons are signaling proteins (cytokines) that infected cells produce and release in response to viruses. Interferons activate other cells of the immune system so that a stronger immune system response can be achieved. Interferon alphas are specifically recommended for viral infections and some cancers. The efficacy of these processes for Covid19 is controversial. Therefore, alternative approaches are urgently needed.",

Good results are obtained using Interferon Alpha 2B (IFNrec) without any combination with Kaletra. The use of Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C (Vit-C) has shown promise in this area in China. The IV Vit-C (or Ascorbic acid) protocols are mentioned in clinicaltrials.gov, for Covid19 and other pathologies. Shanghai now utilizes IV Vit-C in the treatment for Covid-19. Many physicians in China have identified promising results using IV Vit-C against Covid19. Thus, there is a need to urgently review the uses of IV Vit-C, pre- and post-infection, and during different stages of the infection. IV Vit-C is helping to develop a stronger immune system response, reducing the cytokines storm, or increasing antiviral activities through other unknown mechanisms.",

            "text": "Perhaps, the reduction of the cytokines storm in the late stages of the Covid19 infection is the most significant application of IV Vit-C. Covid19 pneumonia is a complex medical disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. This causes severe lung injury that results in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening lung disorder. This process prevents the necessary oxygen to enter into the lungs and ultimately causes death. Coronaviruses increase oxidative stress that promotes cellular malfunction and ultimately results in organ failure. It is believed that pulmonary failure (ARDS) is the principal cause of Covid19\u2032s action on humans. This helps to increase oxidative stress considerably because of the generation of free radicals and cytokines. This process finally leads to serious cellular injury, organ failure and death. The administration of anti-oxidizing agents along with proven conventional supportive therapies is believed to have an important role in controlling these medical situations. Appropriate vaccines and antiviral drugs for the Covid19 epidemic are not available. IV Vitamin C and other antioxidants are extremely good agents for ARDS. These can be applied clinically. Importantly, high dose IV Vit-C is safe and effective. In this paper, we review the use of high-dose Vit-C as an efficient method of treatment for patients with cancers and infections.",

The antiviral activities of ascorbic acid was known and it was published almost 80 years ago [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] when scientists were involved in work on poliomyelitis. Moreover, the use of ascorbic acid as a medicinally crucial agent against various diseases was also well established [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Applications of Vit-C are found in poliomyelitis [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26]]. Many other uses of Vit-C include hepatitis, herpes, chickenpox and measles, infectious mononucleosis, trichinosis, urethritis, Antabuse, arthritis, and cancer. Vit-C is also helpful for the treatment of elevated cholesterol and arteriosclerosis, [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]], corneal ulcers, glaucoma, burns, heatstroke, sunburn, slipped disc, toxins, and heavy metal poisonings [[33], [34], [35]]. The appropriate clinically effective vaccines and specific antivirals may serve effectively if they are available. Considering the current situation, the use of Vit-C as an antiviral agent should also be considered. Notably, Vit-C can be used alone or in combination with other available medicines to exert positive synergistic effects. Here we review the principal mechanism of actions of IV Vit-C that helps to make the immune system stronger, reduces the cytokines storm and inhibits oxidative processes. Under the first criteria, literature knowledge on cancer treatment will be reviewed first. Then, the antiviral properties will be reviewed, with focusing on the reduction of the oxidative pathways typical of the Covid19 ARDS.",

Vit-C is a crucial nutrient with redox properties, a cofactor of numerous enzymes, and it plays an important role in the synthesis of collagen [37]. A deficiency of Vit-C may result in scurvy [38]. Scurvy can cause collagen structure narrow and thin. It has been found that normal healthy situation can be maintained with the administration of Vit-C. In the mid-20th century, a study hypothesized that cancer can originate due to the alterations of the structures in connective tissues caused by Vit-C deficiency [39]. A review suggested that a high-dose of ascorbic acid can enhance host resistance. This study also identified the use of ascorbic acid in cancer therapy [40]. In general, Vit-C is synthesized from isomeric sugars d-glucose or d-galactose by numerous plants and animals. Interestingly, humans lack the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase which is required for ascorbic acid synthesis. On this basis, humans need Vit-C through food or other supplements [37].",

Some cancer patients were treated successfully with high-dose of oral and/or IV Vit-C. However, two early randomized placebo-controlled studies of high-dose oral Vit-C (10 g/d) indicated no significant effects against cancers. These studies indicated marginal medical benefits between ascorbate- and placebo-treated groups. Laboratory experiments reported that high-dose of Vit-C can decrease cell proliferation in prostate, pancreatic, colon, mesothelioma, and neuroblastoma cancer cell lines. Studies of Vit-C combined with other medicines in animal models demonstrated inconclusive results. Importantly, IV Vit-C was well-tolerated in clinical trials. An IV administration of Vit-C (500 mg) was found to be more effective than oral administration since a higher blood concentration of ascorbate was found through the IV route. A study with Vit-C as ascorbate versus ascorbate formulations along with standard cancer therapies was performed in clinical trials. Two studies of high-dose Vit-C confirmed a better quality of life and fewer cancer-related toxicities. These results from preclinical and clinical trials of high-dose Vit-C with and without standard cancer therapies are note-worthy. However, it may be challenged that these investigations have a few shortcomings.",

The application of Vit-C therapy in the treatment of various cancers was promoted [42,43]. For example, two clinical trials of Vit-C were conducted many years ago [44,45]. Pharmacokinetic experiments identified considerable differences in the maximum achieved blood concentrations of Vit-C. It was found that the nature of the route of delivery was relevant. For example, if Vit-C was taken orally, plasma concentrations are controlled with a peak achievable concentration of less than 300 \u03bcM. However, this control was bypassed with IV administration of the vitamin, resulting in a very high level of Vit-C plasma concentration (up to 20 mM) [46,47]. Additional research suggested that pharmacological concentrations of ascorbate as achieved with IV administration may result in cell death in numerous cancer cell lines [48]. Health care practitioners who had participated in complementary and alternative medicine conferences in 2006 and 2008 were debated on the benefits/risks of high-dose IV Vit-C in patients. A total of 199 participants were chosen and out of which 172 were taken Vit-C. Specifically, IV Vit-C was recommended to fight against infection, cancer, and fatigue [49].",

Conventional therapies were applied to these patients, but these were not successful. On this basis, these patients were recommended to take ascorbic acid. Different doses and schedules were used. For example, some patients were given IV ascorbic acid (10 g/day for 10 successive days), a few were given higher dose amounts, and some were chosen to give oral ascorbic acid (10 g/day) or a combination of both. A wide variety of responses were found. Dome of them had no or minimal response and some of them had tumor regression and tumor hemorrhage. Despite this important observation, a lack of control study prevented making any conclusion on the health benefits of ascorbic acid treatment. From a limited study published in 1975, it is apparent that one of the patients experienced tumor regression [60]. The patient who had reticulum cell sarcoma exhibited improvement due to the treatment with ascorbic acid. A reduction of the daily dose of ascorbic acid was not helpful since symptoms of the disease appeared. Notably, remission was successfully achieved again after the same patient was given a higher initial dose of ascorbic acid.",

These were a combination of well-known agents: oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil or leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan hydrochloride. This study was conducted on 36 patients with metastatic colorectal or gastric cancer. The principal aims were to evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose. Another goal was to determine the phase II dose of ascorbic acid with co-administration with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. Initially, all patients were given an identical chemotherapy treatment for 14 days with Vit-C infusions. Later, the concentration of ascorbic acid was altered for the dose-escalation investigation. This study demonstrated no dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, a maximum-tolerated dose was not identified from this investigation. However, a dose of 1.5 g/kg for ascorbic acid was recommended for this phase II study. No adverse side effects were observed and the treatments were acceptable to the patients. Based on the success, a randomized phase III investigation is under progress. The goal of this study is to determine the clinical power of ascorbic acid against metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with mFOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab [67].",

More than 300 scientific and clinical studies supported mechanistic data to use Vit-C against this disease [85,86]. Some other additional role of Vit-C in the treatment of viral diseases is also possible. The biological concepts and evidence for the use of Vit-C in viral infections are described here.",

            "text": "Numerous studies identified that Vit-C in high dosages is virucidal [83]. This conclusion was based on in-vitro experiments. In the presence of copper and/or iron, high doses of Vit-C showed virucidal activity. This was explained through the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other radical initiators [87,88]. Moreover, the low pH value of the system was responsible for the in-vitro antiviral effects of Vit-C. Despite these studies, the in vivo virucidal activity of Vit-C was not confirmed. It was well established that Vit-C is a powerful antioxidant and it can exert pro-oxidant effects at high concentrations. The generation of reactive oxygen species through the reduction of transition metal is possible [89]. It was found that a very high-dose of one sodium salt of ascorbic acid (90 mM) kills Candida albicans in-vitro through an iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction [90]. An iron chelator 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl inhibited this effect. An experiment demonstrated that Vit-C can decrease the viral load of the Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) [91]. This observation suggested multiple mechanisms are involved in Vit-C-controlled anti-vital therapy. The activity of antigens and load was reduced through pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblast and endothelial cells with ascorbate before cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [92]. This observation was failed to reproduce when ascorbate is added after the infection. The immunomodulatory activities of Vit-C were responsible for this effect. In general, Ascorbic acid is concentrated in leucocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages [93,94]. Chemotaxis was improved by Vit-C [[95], [96], [97]]. The neutrophil phagocytic activity and oxidative death were also enhanced [[95], [96], [97]]. Lymphocyte proliferation was also accelerated [[95], [96], [97]].",

Mutations in the gene of this enzyme prevented anthropoid primates and guinea pigs to synthesize this molecule. The effects of Vit-C in viral infections were studied via a Gulo (-/-) knockout mice system. It was shown that nasal inoculation of the H3N2 influenza virus is fatal in Gulo (-/-) mice in comparison to wild type mice [97]. Anti-viral cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2 became lower. However, the viral titers in the lung of ascorbic acid-insufficient Gulo (-/-) mice became more abundant [97]. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1)-\u03b1/\u03b2, and infiltration of inflammatory cells was increased in the lung. These results were corrected in Gulo (-/-) mice repleted with ascorbic acid before viral exposure occurs. Most probably, an impaired phosphorylation process of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) was responsible for the decreased generation of IFN in Gulo (-/-) mice [98]. It was found that Gulo (-/-) mice as compared to wild type mice have an impaired immune response with higher lung pathological dysfunction when exposed to influenza H1N1 virus [98]. It was shown that restraint-stressed mice with H1N1-induced pneumonia have a dose-dependent reduction of mortality in the presence of ascorbate. Histopathological lung sections also demonstrated reduced problems in the treated mice [99]. An administration of Vit-C was helpful to recover mitochondrial membrane potential and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ascorbic acid was reported to have clinical activity against numerous other viruses including poliovirus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, human lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and rabies virus in addition to demonstrating activity against influenza and herpes virus [[100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107]].",

            "text": "It is known that most of the infections activate phagocytes with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS has a key role in deactivating viruses. Some of the ROS harm the host cells that cause viral-induced host injury. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the upper and lower respiratory tract in infants and children. RSV infection of airway epithelial cells accelerates ROS production and this inhibits the concentration of the lung antioxidant enzymes. The oxidant-antioxidant amount and proportion in cells are critical to RSV pulmonary toxicity [108]. Lung pulmonary inflammation and injury are considerably reduced by the administration of antioxidants [109]. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant and therefore, it scavenges oxygen free radicals and restores other cellular antioxidants. These include tetrahydrobiopterin and \u03b1-tocopherol [94]. The hypothesis that Vit-C may become beneficial in the treatment of viral infections is based on two concepts. Patients with infectious diseases do not have a sufficient level of Vit-C due to metabolic consumption [110]. Vit-C has immunomodulating properties in patients with viral infections. This is possible by increasing the production of \u03b1/\u03b2 interferons and downregulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite that Vit-C have beneficial effects in viral infections no solid clinical data exists on this topic. Pauling suggested that Vit-C can be used for the treatment of the common cold. On this basis, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs\u2019) targeted the role of Vit-C in the prevention and treatment of the cold symptoms. In an analysis of 29 RCTs, Vit-C failed to reduce cold disease [82]. No consistent effects of Vit-C were observed also on the duration of colds in patients. Several studies, however, complicated the interpretation of these data.",

Herpes zoster (HZV) infection takes place due to the reactivation of the latent Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). This is particularly predominant because of the loss of cell-induced immunity with age. The concentration of ascorbic acid in plasma is decreased in post-herpetic neuralgia patients compared to healthy persons [111]. An RCT study was conducted with 41 patients who were subjected to IV Vit-C (50 mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 5) or placebo [111]. It was found that those patients who were taken IV Vit-C have experienced less pain. In a non-blinded RCT, the role of ascorbic acid on acute herpetic pain and postherpetic neuralgia were evaluated [112]. Eighty-seven patients were given 5 g of IV ascorbic acid on the first, third and fifth days or placebo. Interestingly, a few differences between the groups were observed. The treated group with Vit-C demonstrated a lower incidence of postherpetic neuralgia and a lower pain score. Vit-C is mostly concentrated in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber of the eye. A retrospective cohort investigation indicated that oral Vit-C reduced the risk of herpes simplex keratitis in combination with an oral antiviral drug [111].",

Influenza A virus causes epidemics and pandemics that kill thousands of people every year. Experimental studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of ascorbic acid against influenza. Patients with respiratory disorders due to infection by influenza were treated with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) without corticosteroids. Remarkably, these patients showed rapid improvement after the initiation of HAT. Corticosteroids, on the other hand, have a complex role in the treatment of infection. As a result, corticosteroids may not be a standard choice in patients with influenza A infection [113,114]. Effective clinical trials are necessary to investigate the use of Vit-C against infections due to influenza, RSV, herpes, and other viral illnesses.",

For example, a 26 % ICU admission and a 4.3 % mortality rate are observed among 138 cases [116]. It is believed that ARDS is the main mechanism for Covid19\u2032s action. This is followed by increased oxidative stress because of the release of free radicals and cytokines. Considering this mechanism of the process, a large dose of Vit-C should play a key role in the management of Covid19. A study indicates out of 99 Covid19 patients, 17 of them developed ARDS [117]. Eleven patients passed away due to multiple organ failure [117]. This death was explained due to increased oxidative stress and cytokine generation that lead to ARDS. Like influenza, coronaviruses are pandemic viruses that injure lung drastically [118]. This viral infection generates a \u201cstorm\u201d of cytokines that reacts with the endothelial cells of the lung. This interaction causes neutrophil infiltration and enhances oxidative stress and damages the function of the lung barrier [118]. ARDS is characterized by strong hypoxemia. This is propagated because of multiple reasons. Uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier are the main reasons [119]. The severe increased oxidative stress causes pulmonary injuries: lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. ALI and ARDS are key factors responsible for substantially high morbidity and mortality [120,121]. An increase of C-reactive protein (hsCRP), an indicator of inflammation and oxidative stress is seen among Covid19 patients [122]. The transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid-2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element (ARE) driven cytoprotective protein expression. It is believed that the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathways plays a crucial role in preventing cells and tissues to undergo oxidative stress.",
