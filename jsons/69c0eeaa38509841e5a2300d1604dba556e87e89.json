The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This can be deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications. Predicted curves for some of the most affected countries can be seen at https://collaboration.coraltele.com/covid/.",

            "text": "The novel Coronavirus disease was first reported on 31 December 2019 in the Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It started spreading rapidly across the world [1] . The cumulative incidence of the causitive virus (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly increasing and has affected 196 countries and territories with USA, Spain, Italy, U.K. and France being the most affected [2] . World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, while the virus continues to spread [3] . As on 4 May 2020, a total of 3,581,884 confirmed positive cases have been reported leading to 248,558 deaths [2] . The major difference between the pandemic caused by CoV-2 and related viruses, like SARS and MERS is the ability of CoV-2 to spread rapidly through human contact and leave nearly 20% infected subjects as Motivation and Our Contributions: ML [11] can be utilized to handle large data and intelligently predict the spread of the disease. Cloud computing [12] can be used to rapidly enhance the prediction process using high-speed computations [7] . Novel energy-efficient edge systems can be used to procure data, in order to bring down power consumption. In this paper, we present a prediction model deployed using FogBus framework [13] for accurate prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases, the rise and the fall of the number of cases in near future and the date when various countries may expect the pandemic to end. We also provide a detailed comparison with a baseline model and show how catastrophic the effects can be if poorly fitting models are used. We present a prediction scheme based on the ML model, which can be used in remote cloud nodes for real-time prediction allowing governments and citizens to respond proactively. Finally, we summarize this work and present various research directions.",

Cloud framework: The ML models are built to make a good advanced prediction of the number of new cases and the dates when the pandemic might end. To provide fail-safe computation and quick data analysis, we propose a framework to deploy these models on cloud datacenters, as shown in Figure 1 .In a cloud based environment, the government hospitals and private health-centers continuously send their positive patient count. Population density, average and median age, weather conditions, health facilities etc. are also to be integrated for enhancing the accuracy of the predictions. For this case study, we used three instances of single core Azure B1s virtual machines with 1-GiB RAM, SSD Storage and 64-bit Microsoft Windows Server 2016 1 . We used the HealthFog [11] framework leveraging the FogBus [13] for deploying multiple analysis tasks in an ensemble learning fashion to predict various metrics, like the number of anticipated facilities to manage patients and the hospitals. We analyzed that the cost of tracking patients on a daily basis, amortized CPU consumption and Cloud execution is 37% and only 1.2 USD per day. As the dataset size increases, computationally more powerful resources would be needed.",

In recent study by Data-Driven Innovation Laboratory, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) 3 , the regression curves were drawn using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model [24] and Gaussian distribution was deployed to estimate the number of cases with time. However, in the previously reported studies on the earlier version of the virus, namely SARA-CoV-1, the data was reported to follow Generalized Inverse Weibull (GIW) Distribution [25] better than Gaussian as shown in Figure 2 (details of Robust Weibull fitting follow in the next section). Detailed comparison for SARS-CoV-2 has been described in the next section. This fits the following function to the data:",

Now, we can find the appropriate values of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 to minimize the error between the predicted cases (y = f (x)) and the actual cases (\u0177). This can be done using the popular Machine Learning technique of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) for curve fitting [26] . However, as various sources have suggested, in initial stages of COVID-19 the data has many outliers and noise. This makes it hard to accurately predict the number of cases. Thus, we propose an iterative weighting strategy and call our fitting technique \"Robust Fitting\". A diagrammatic representation of the iterative weighting process is shown in Figure 3 .",

This is to have a higher value for points far from the curve and near 0 value for closer points. This, is then standardized by dividing with max value over all points and subtracted from 1 to get a weight corresponding to each point. This weight is then standardized using sof tmax function so that sum of all weights is 1. The curve is fit again using LM method, now with the new weights w n+1 i .

Five sets of global data on daily new COVID-19 cases were used to fit parameters of different types of distributions. Finally, we identified the best performing 5 distributions. The results are shown in Table 1 . We observe that using the iteratively weighted approach, the Inverse Weibull function fits the best to the COVID-19 dataset, as compared to the iterative versions of Gaussian, Beta (4-parameter), Fisher-Tippet (Extreme Value distribution), and Log Normal functions. When applied to the same dataset, Iterative Weibull showed an average MAPE of 12% lower than non-iteratively weighted Weibull. A step-by-step algorithm for iteratively weighted curve fitting using the GIW distribution (called \"Robust Weibull\") is given in Algorithm 1.",

Having better fit models, as proposed here, could help plan a better strategy, based on more accurate predictions and future scenarios. Figure 5 shows the total predicted number of cases for all countries across the globe. Here we have neglected those countries where the data is insufficient for making predictions, or the number of days for data is less than 30. As shown in Figure 4 explained in model section, the fit curve can be used to predict the number of cases that will have to be dealt by the country, assuming the same trend continues. The figure illustrates that the maximum number of total cases will be in the North America region. The number of cases will also be high in the European continent, Russia and eastern Asia, including China, the original epicenter of the disease. 4 Curves and predictions of all countries have been given in Appendix 5 All rights reserved.

Firstly, other important parameters like population density, distribution of age, individual and community movements, level of healthcare facilities available, strain type and virulence of the virus etc., need to be included in the regression model to further enhance the prediction accuracy. Secondly, models like ARIMA [27] can be integrated with Weibull function for further time series analysis and predictions. Thirdly, ML can be utilized to predict the structure and function of various proteins associated with CoV-2 and their interaction with the host human proteins and cellular environment. The contribution of various socio-economic variables that determine the vulnerability, spread and progression of the epidemic can be predicted by developing suitable algorithms. AI based proactive measures can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus to sensitive groups in the society. Real time sensors can be used, for example in traffic camera or surveillance, which track COVID-19 symptoms based on visual imaging and tracking Apps, and inform respective hospitals and administrative authorities for punitive action [28] . Tracking needs to cover all stages from ports of entries to public places and hospitals [29] . The research directions and challenges are summarized in Figure 6 .",
