In this paper, we study how evolution mechanisms traditionally observed within social networks can affect information diffusion. We present an approach that merges two models: model of information diffusion through social networks and model of network evolution. Since epidemics provide a reference in application domains of information spreading, we measure the impact of basic network structure changes on epidemic peak value and timing. Then we investigate observed trends in terms of changes appearing in the network structure. Our results provide promising results on how and why network dynamics is a strong parameter to integrate in requirements for information spreading modelling.",

In this work we focus on the impact of network dynamics by comparing effect of several evolution mechanisms on incidence curves. We show that the dynamics of links plays an important role in spreading through the network, and therefore is a strong requirement to consider for modeling the behavior of information diffusion in real world networks. A concrete example that motivates this study is provided by intervention strategies that are currently proposed in epidemiology and are generally focused on nodebased measures. For example, the intervention strategy that gives best results is to vaccinate individuals (nodes) with a highest degree. However, it is obvious that individuals with highest degree at time t will probably not be in the same state at time (t + 1), due to changes that occur in the network. Therefore, dynamic appears to have a strong and real impact on spreading, and have to be taken into account.",

Mathematical approach of compartment models for epidemics modeling like the standard SIR (Susceptible \u2212 Inf ected \u2212 Recovered) model perfectly fits other cases such as knowledge or rumor spreading. These models consider that individuals moves from a state to another with a given probability. The transitions \"Susceptible to Infected\" and \"Infected to Recovered\" defined for epidemics are obviously analogous to \"Innovator to Incubator\" and \"Incubator to Adopter\" transitions in knowledge diffusion as underlined by Borner et al. [4] . Network models have extended compartment models more appropriately to understand diffusion process since they involve individuals (nodes) and contact links (vertices) among them [8, 5, 21] .

Thus, we measure the impact of evolution strategies on the diffusion process by introducing the information (a disease) in an evolving network. We assume, as is often the case in real life, that individuals behavior does not change with the occurrence of the disease, i.e. the network still follows to the same evolution strategy. The two models of evolution are concerning: (1) the network that is evolving and (2) the disease that is spreading into this evolving network. In the commonly used SIR model of disease spreading, parameters are the \u03b2 probability of transmission per contact and the \u03b3 probability of recover. We assume that a susceptible individual i has a probability 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) k i t to become infected, where k i t is the number of infected neighbors of the node i at time t. Incidence curves of SIR epidemics spread are illustrated in Figure 1 . According to this model, the epidemic is dependent on the initial infected population size and on probabilities \u03b2 and \u03b3. For instance it is demonstrated that for high values of \u03b2 and low values of \u03b3, the diffusion is improved as depicted on Figure 1 .",
