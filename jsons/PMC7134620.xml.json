During the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the proportion of infected health-care workers ranged from about 20% to 60% of cases worldwide with differences between hospitals; the better the education in infection control, the lower the risk.10, 11\n",

It affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, complicates the delivery of patients' care, contributes to patients' deaths and disability, promotes resistance to antibiotics, and generates additional expenditure to that already incurred by the patient's underlying disease. Infection has several causes related to the systems and the processes of care provision, economic constraints on systems and countries, and human behaviour. Prevention strategies reduce infection in both developed and developing countries; most are simple and not resource-demanding.12, 13, 14 Several health-care settings have succeeded in reducing the risk to patients, but others have not. Thus, gaps in patients' safety arise because existing tools and interventions are not being implemented widely. Importantly, this gap exists not only between countries, but also within the same country; where some hospitals succeed, others cannot, or even do not, try.",
