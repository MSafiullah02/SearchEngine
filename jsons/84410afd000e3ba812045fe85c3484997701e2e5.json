The human-animal interface is the nexus that permits the cross-species transmission of infectious agents and is represented by a continuum of contacts between humans and animals, either directly or indirectly through their products and their shared environments. 2 'The human-animal interface' 3 is thus a term that encompasses the wider socioeconomic and biological influences of disease transmission and spread, elements which are fundamental to the examination of human-animal infectious disease management. It is the human-animal interface that has arbitrated the transmission of zoonotic diseases and the introduction of novel pathogens into new geographical areas and novel host species. However, while its role in disease transmission is not new, because of globalization, its current ecological dimensions are of a completely different order of magnitude. 4 In essence, modern industrialized society is an important source of the expanded ecological pressure at the human-animal interface. The human-animal interface therefore provides an important conceptual framework for the examination of the public and animal health risks of animalsourced epidemics, and through health policy, their relationship with risk enabling anthropogenic activities. These risk enabling activities include changes in land use, livestock production, chosen routes for economic growth and trade promotion; activities that both foster and enhance zoonosis transmission. 5", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1147, "end": 1148, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Setting the Stage"}, {"text": "Globalization plays a central role in shaping the debate around trade and health. This is because it is a comprehensive, multi-faceted phenomenon that is rapidly transforming society. 6 There are different, but important, understandings of what the term globalization means. Lee, Fustukian, and Buse, 7 describe globalization in terms of its spatial, cognitive and temporal dimensions, useful propositions for disaggregating the important aspects of policy that impact on the management of infectious disease risk. However, the key driver of globalization remains the internationalization of commerce; to which, it has been argued, health usually takes a backseat. 8 According to a National Academies of Science report, 9 the globalization phenomenon has had a snowball effect with regard to infectious disease emergence. It has helped to create the microbial equivalent of 'a perfect storm'. Mann, 10 states this microbial perfect storm will not subside, but will be a recurring event. Changes in land use, livestock production, chosen routes for economic growth and promotion of commerce, climate change etc. are some of the elements that go into the 'perfect microbial storm'. Under livestock intensification, for example, the larger collections of animals provide optimal incubating conditions for the expansion of emerging zoonotic diseases. 11 Globalization is therefore a conduit for infectious disease spread; mainly because of the increased industry, cultural, and microorganism interconnectedness it fosters. 12 Recent examples of global infectious disease spread, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and pandemic avian influenza, have negatively impacted on both public health and economies. Such threats have led to a shift to develop policies to respond to these risks, at national, regional and international levels. But because the dynamics, and therefore the risks, of disease emergence differ from location to location, equally important is the integration, within these policy frameworks, of approaches to assessing both the risk's 'local' likelihood and 'impact' to ensure, to the extent possible, the appropriateness of policy responses. 13 This is a challenge, for both developing and developed countries, given the myriad interests that contribute to this 'perfect microbial storm.' It is reasonable to assume, however, that the risk of infectious diseases, and in particular, pandemic scale infectious disease emergence, is unlikely to abate, and as a result, the public health and animal health communities have to think of emerging infectious diseases, their control and the assessment of their risk of occurrence in completely novel ways.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 185, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 275, "end": 279, "text": "Lee,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 280, "end": 290, "text": "Fustukian,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 291, "end": 300, "text": "and Buse,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 301, "end": 302, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 665, "end": 666, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1521, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Globalization and the Relationship Between Trade and Health: The Microbial Perfect Storm"}, {"text": "Trade and its effects on public health, through disease spread, is a matter of both historical and contemporary policy significance. Historically, disease has spread through traded products and carriage vehicles such as ships, which served as means of introduction of infectious agents into new geographic areas. 14 The link between international trade and the spread of infectious diseases has therefore been recognized for centuries, for example the fourteenth century spread of the 'Black Death' along known international trading routes. 15 It was this recognition that resulted in the International Sanitary Conferences, the first of which was held in France in 1851. 16 At several points in history, trade has been restricted to protect health, with the primary motivation being to minimize interference in trade from health. 17 In recent times, economic interests have taken precedence over health concerns. 18 Similar arguments have been made concerning global health policy, 19 access to medicines, 20 food safety 21 and infectious disease spread. 22 Considering the role that trade policy plays in disease spread and control is relevant. Key here is the view of public health proponents that health concerns most of the time plays second fiddle to the interests of global commerce. For instance, Lipson's 23 review of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) health agenda and the study by Shaffer et al. 24 on ethics in public health research both suggest that trade agreements in particular shape national policies on such issues as food safety and health, restricting the capacity of state agencies to regulate these areas.

This led to 71 human cases in six American states. 26 For SARS, bat trade was proposed to be one way in which contact with susceptible amplifying hosts was made at some point in the wildlife supply chain, leading to subsequent marketrelated human and animal interaction and infection. 27 Live animal markets in Southeast Asia have been implicated in the spread of emerging diseases such as avian influenza, with subsequent human exposure. 28 Even for countries in Africa, African Swine Fever, an animal health problem of trans-boundary animal disease significance, spread rapidly along the Atlantic coast in the dynamic coastal trading networks of West Africa during the late 1990s. 29 Looking at the trade and health problem from a slightly different perspective, perhaps it is not a simple case of one set of concerns taking pre-eminence over another.

The OIE has been setting international animal health standards for purposes of facilitating safe trade in livestock and livestock products of trade under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement of the WTO in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code. 36 Thus countries that are involved in livestock and livestock product trade are expected to comply with the SPS Agreement in order to reap the full benefits of international commerce. 37 Pushing a free trade agenda, 30 Aginam (2002) . 31 WHO/WTO (2002) . 32 Howse (2004) . 33 Merianos and Peiris (2005) . 34 Ibid. 35 Blancou et al.

They almost automatically exclude them from involvement in global trade under WTO regulations. 42 International standards have been used to restrict the direction of trade, on health grounds, from resource-enabled to resource-constrained countries. For instance, Rweyemamu and Astudillo, 43 state that the global distribution of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) mirrors the world's economic structure, with industrialized countries generally being free of the disease while developing countries were endemic, which pushes trade in a North-south direction. Furthermore, even with international guidelines and standards provided to facilitate trade, many developing countries have to deal with a range of animal diseases simultaneously; making regulation and technical considerations extremely difficult. 44 The dominant view is that developing countries pose the greatest risk as sources of infectious diseases. 45 In fact, the FAO's philosophy is to control these diseases at this source. 46 This perspective also implies that disease control efforts would focus on the 'global impacting' disease problems from this source, but foster particular methods of control that may not be appropriate for different contexts. Adopting such methods can harm local livelihoods or worse, inadvertently encourage further disease spread. 47 Furthermore, as argued in an analysis of the politics of the securitization 48 of health, a lip service effect may be created, as policy actors in different contexts are pressured to verbalize an infectious disease threat as a priority, but may not treat it as such. 49 For the world's poorest states, the confluence of interests surrounding global health and global trade therefore presents unique challenges.

More importantly, in these debates, resource-constrained countries are dichotomously perceived as simultaneously needing the most protection and posing the greatest risk.

However, when threats such as zoonotic diseases are global rather than local, the vagaries of context, institutions and culture play important roles in the construction of such events as risks, elements that are not exogenous to the technical-scientific processes of risk analysis. This empirical section is based on a policy study that examined the avian and pandemic influenza policy process in Zambia over the 2005-2009 period to suggest a pragmatic way of increasing the efficacy of risk analysis methodology in guiding livestock trade decisions and multi-sectoral disease risk management in resource-constrained contexts. Using the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) risk analysis framework as an illustration, we demonstrate how the cross-cutting and highly contingent nature of today's infectious disease threats provide learning points for re-conceptualizing the use of risk analysis to inform policy, to better account for the institutional and social phenomena that frame both risk perception and management.

For instance, Urlich Beck 59 in his seminal book Risk Society introduces the theory of reflexive modernization in which the processes of modernity in industrialized societies are posited to be the cause of the emergence of unprecedented and indeterminate risks and hazards, including those presented by infectious diseases. Some of these modernization processes were alluded to earlier, when we discussed the factors that have led to the emergence of infectious diseases. Within this body of work, risk creation, construction and response are intrinsically linked to modernization, and knowledge and science are argued to play a constitutive and sometimes unexamined role in these processes. Beck's views share commonalities with those of another renown sociologist, Anthony Giddens. 60 In Giddens' 61 conception of reflexive modernization, the increasing dependence on 59 Beck (1992) . 60 Giddens (1998) , pp. 23-34. 61 see also Lupton (1999). society's 'experts' to determine what is and how to respond to 'risk' in societies, has brought with it risk's polar opposite, uncertainty. Risk analysis, for instance, is a process of creating scenarios of risk which are based on contingent scientific knowledge and is therefore subject to change. Uncertainty arises when risk cannot be precisely calculated, e.g. when the probability of occurrence of adverse events are unknown or inestimable. 62 Uncertainty and surprise, in turn, have led to concerns over the validity of purely scientific responses to risk. 63 Both Beck and Giddens propose a more reflexive approach to risk in which the underpinnings of scientific assertions are drawn out, their situational implications assessed and alternative knowledge bases co-opted, thus taking the risk assessment process out of the 'problematized' purely scientific sphere into a more discursive treatment of 'risk'. An important assertion is made by risk sociologists Douglas and Wildavsky, 64 that although the dangers are real, risk is 'politicized' through several social processes, giving risk a status which is separate from the actual dangers presented by various hazards. Slovic 65 further states that this politicization process makes risk assessment a subjective blend \"of science and judgment with important psychological, social, cultural, and political factors\". 66 Douglas 67 in particular, presents risk, within a social context, as attributable to an Other. The position of 'Otherness' is subsumed by developing countries, where they are presented as both source and victim of various infectious disease threats. Therefore, a primary focus is to assign blame, first in the global narrative (North to South, or West to East) and then in a regional narrative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 977, "end": 988, "text": "Beck (1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 991, "end": 993, "text": "60", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 994, "end": 1008, "text": "Giddens (1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2425, "text": "66", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical Framework: Risk as a Confluence of Probabilistic Science and Social Construction"}, {"text": "But infectious disease threats are not merely western obsessions misaligned with the needs and subjectivities of developing country contexts.

It is an exotic disease to us, but it is a possible emerging disease' (Interview 4). Linked to this was a second narrative framing, which presented H5N1 is an infectious agent of poultry with limited zoonotic potential. This narrative therefore framed H5N1 as a predominantly poultry health concern, described as 'basically . . . more of an animal disease which then moves into human beings' (Interview 2). This narrative also justified the need for veterinary leadership in developing any prevention measure to be taken, and reflected the broader international veterinary narrative on H5N1, a problem that required the use of standardized, time-tested technical veterinary approaches to animal disease control. 115 The problem with this narrative is that in Zambia, at least, the country's veterinary priority lay on controlling cattle diseases. For decision-makers, poultry production was a low priority, 'When you look at our focus, we are more oriented towards cattle. So most of the diseases that affect cattle are given priority. Probably you will look at it and what you get is that birds or bird diseases are not so significant or are not so associated with major economic losses.

There were contextual differences between the production systems of Southeast Asia and Zambia in respect to typical farming practices, for instance, the role that rice paddies, duck production and wet markets that went side by side with chicken rearing in Southeast Asia was widely dissimilar to the small flock scavenger chickens reared in rural Zambia. 117 Furthermore, even the concept of backyard production had a different meaning in Zambia. It represented small scale, often commercially oriented stock fed flocks of broiler or layer chickens, raised to supplement household income through chicken and egg sales, using closed structures with some level of restricted access. 118 Nevertheless, the risk of H5N1 from rural farmers in Zambia was couched in a biosecurity narrative in which smallholder, rural poultry producers were viewed as representing the biggest risk for introducing avian influenza into the country, 'We believe that avian influenza may come from a poor farmer who doesn't believe in biosecurity.

Risk analysis can benefit from social processes like policy making. Perceptions of H5N1 risk were framed differently across various sectors, including the poultry and allied industries, the media, health, agriculture and trade. This implies that different risk perceptions influence policy processes in different but significant ways. The OIE risk analysis framework, 126 is a science-based method for the assessment of infectious disease risk that is based on the system developed by Covello and Merkhofer. 127 It is a 'Red Book' model 128 heuristic device conceptualized to involve four interacting and iterative stages; hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. 129 This structure makes the framework amenable to a discussion on the policy considerations relevant to its application in different contexts. The OIE risk analysis framework's importance to policy is highlighted in the fact that, since the inception of the WTO in 1995, the OIE framework in general has achieved recognition within the WTO SPS agreement as the standard for facilitating trade in animal and animal products. 130 The framework has been, and continues to be, applied to assess animal disease risks for scenarios other than those that are trade-related 131 and has been successfully adapted to a human health setting. 132 It therefore provides a structured approach to risk assessment and is considered to be an iterative and transparent standard for quantifying risk and informing policy. 133 In the OIE framework, risk assessment is the most technical component of the process and can be a qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative assessment of risk on the basis of expert knowledge and/or empirical data. 134 The entire framework, however, is subject to the policy processes of the particular context in which the risk assessment is conducted. This is because the framing of risk, and therefore its assessment, involves the interplay of both contextual and social factors. A weakness of the framework therefore is that it primarily relies on the engagement of expert knowledge, and their presentation of the underlying assumptions and the steps followed in the determination of risk. 135 By relying primarily on the knowledge of scientific experts, the framework is blind to social influences, and, in the case of risk management policy development in resource-constrained countries, partial to the narratives on risk voiced by the international agencies holding the purse strings. This is a pertinent potential flaw. As noted with similar technocratic models, 136 funding agencies could select only experts whose viewpoints resonate with their policy agendas, making their assessments of risk highly contestable. Another concern is a lack of robustness in this approach's dealing with the ambiguities of scientific uncertainty and surprise 137 and, a failure to fully engage political processes and social choices in addressing risk. 138 One solution is \"to develop a more holistic perspective\" of risk \"that includes explicit consideration of the roles of policy, disease management, and feedbacks between ecosystems and societies.\" 139 There are novel approaches that suggest ways of better combining science and policy making such as Millstone's 140 'co-evolutionary model'. But the preceding critique is not a basis to reject the OIE framework. It is important to suggest how it can be made more amenable to social processes. Part of its appeal, as argued by Hueston, 141 is that the framework holds promise for the consideration of policy processes in the assessment of risk. Hueston, however, does not offer any suggestions on how this may be achieved. But the OIE risk analysis framework is useful for assisting decision-makers thinking around particular aspects of risk, which helps inform resource allocation in risk mitigation. 142 We will therefore examine the OIE framework through a policy lens, drawing on insights developed by Millstone 143 wherever they may apply.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 739, "end": 765, "text": "Covello and Merkhofer. 127", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "129", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1385, "text": "130", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1764, "text": "133", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1988, "text": "134", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3415, "end": 3418, "text": "139", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3744, "end": 3752, "text": "Hueston,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3753, "end": 3756, "text": "141", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4119, "end": 4122, "text": "142", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Risk Analysis and the Policy Context:"}, {"text": "The OIE risk analysis framework places the OIE squarely in the centre of the highly political arena of international animal trade.

This implies the 'practical' data inputs for a risk assessment to inform avian and pandemic influenza control policy.

An important aspect for the risk assessment to address is actually 'when' human exposure is likely to occur following detection of outbreaks in poultry.

In the development of multisectoral zoonosis risk management policy, for instance, the term 'risk manager' is actually fluid, applicable to a multitude of stakeholders. In Zambia's case, for example, there was a 20-person Task Force on Avian and Human Influenza, the Department of Veterinary and Livestock Development, the Ministry of Health, the FAO, the WHO, USAID, the National Agricultural Information Service (NAIS) and the Ministry of Health's Health Education Unit, all working to 'manage' the same risk.

Risk analysis' role in informing decision making would be enhanced if risk is considered across the entire policy spectrum and not just from one viewpoint. In this endeavor, a risk analyst should understand that in multi-sectoral settings, there are differences in priorities, norms and policy frameworks which can impact upon the development of a risk management policy. Such challenges include properly linking the risk management policy response to livestock trade and holistically addressing the various conceivable modes of disease introduction and routes for human exposure.

There is need to also think about how risk is communicated to, and by, different policy stakeholders, including the public, the media, farmers, medics, veterinarians, decision-makers across different sectors and even the donor community. Equally important is that in the process of risk communication, a context appropriate forum is used, allowing for as much dialogue and feedback in the risk analysis process as possible. Such a risk analysis process would derive most benefit if presented both on a forum capable of reaching the largest number of policy relevant stakeholders and in ways that engages the interests of each policy relevant stakeholder. This entails structuring risk in flexible and stakeholder inclusive ways across public health, animal health, trade and more widely.
