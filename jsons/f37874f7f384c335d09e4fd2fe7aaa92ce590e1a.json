            "text": "Integrins are heterodimers, but recent in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that they are also able to associate through their transmembrane domains to form homomeric interactions. Two fundamental questions are the biological relevance of these aggregates and their form of interaction in the membrane domain. Although in vitro experiments have shown the involvement of a GxxxG-like motif, several crosslinking in vivo data are consistent with an almost opposite form of interaction between the transmembrane \u2423-helices. In the present work, we have explored these two questions using molecular dynamics simulations for all available integrin types. We have tested the hypothesis that homomeric interactions are evolutionary conserved, and essential for the cell, using conservative substitutions to filter out nonnative interactions. Our results show that two models, one involving a GxxxG-like motif (model I) and an almost opposite form of interaction (model II) are conserved across all \u2423 and \u2424 integrin types, both in homodimers and homotrimers, with different specificities. No conserved interaction was found for homotetramers. Our results are completely independent from experimental data, both during molecular dynamics simulations and in the selection of the correct models. We rationalize previous seemingly conflicting findings regarding the nature of integrin interhelical homomeric interactions. Proteins 2006; 63:16 -23.",

            "text": "Integrins are heterodimeric type I transmembrane proteins formed by noncovalent association of an \u2423 and a \u2424-subunit. Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane (TM) spanning \u2423-helix and a short cytoplasmic tail. 1 Different types of \u2423 integrins can combine with different \u2424 counterparts, forming a variety of heterodimers. In humans, 18 \u2423-chains can interact with eight different \u2424-chains to form 24 different \u2423/\u2424 heterodimers with varied functions. 2 By spanning the membrane, the integrins serve as a dynamic linkage between cytoplasm and extracellular space, transducing signals across the membrane to mediate cell growth, differentiation, gene expression, motility, and apoptosis. 3 Inside-out signal transduction involves integrin cytoplasmic tails separation and subsequent ectodomain conformational changes, which alters the affinity of integrins for extracellular ligands. 4 -6 A number of experimental results suggest the existence of transmembrane \u2423/\u2424 interactions. [7] [8] [9] For example, electron cryomicroscopy and single particle analysis, 10 cysteine scanning mutagenesis in the transmembrane domain 11 and activation by disruption of transmembrane interactions of integrin \u2423IIb\u24243. 12 Overall, for the \u2423/\u2424 interaction, there seems to exist a general consensus on the type of interaction present in the inactive, low-affinity form. 11, 13, 14 But in addition to growing evidence indicating that \u2423 and \u2424 domains interact, there is also a strong tendency in vitro for \u2423 and \u2424 TM chains to form homooligomers, both in zwitterionic and acidic micelles 15 and in biological membranes. 16, 17 The latter authors examined the interaction of TM domains of the \u24232, \u2423IIb, \u24234, \u24241, \u24243, and \u24247 integrins when expressed as chimeric proteins, showing that most TM domains homooligomerize to some extent. Also, a study of both cytoplasmic and transmembrane part of the \u2423IIb/\u24243 integrin demonstrated only homooligomerization, but not formation of heterooligomers. 18 The way in which TM integrin homomeric interactions take place may be similar to that of glycophorin A (GpA), an interaction that involves a GxxxG-like motif, which was observed by Arkin and Brunger 19 to be prevalent in TM sequences. Indeed, this motif can be found in multiple sequence alignments of predicted TM spanning regions of integrins (see Fig 1,  residues highlighted in gray). The importance of this and other related motifs in \u2423-helical TM domains has been later been demostrated in exhaustive statistical analyses. 20 Further, a selection of a random library of TM sequences for homodimerization clearly showed that the GxxxG motif is sufficient for strong helix-helix interactions. 21 Using the TOXCAT assay, 22 a test that measures the oligomerization of a chimeric protein containing a TM helix in the Escherichia coli inner membrane via transcriptional activation of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a sequence critical for integrin \u2423IIb-TM homodimerization that involved the GxxxG motif was suggested by Li et al. 17 Intriguingly, however, homomeric interactions that are not consistent with the involvement of a GxxxG-like motif have been observed between \u2423 chains by crosslinking of the inactive \u2423IIb/\u24243 dimer, 11 and also between \u2424 chains 23 induced by a G708N mutation in \u24243 TM. The functional relevance of these interactions has been discussed by these authors, and a role for integrin transmembrane homomeric interactions in integrin clustering when binding to multimeric ligands is possible.",

Indeed, only in these conditions the correct structure of M2 could be found. 26 In the absence of experimentally determined helix tilt, the only alternative is to sample the helix tilt at small intervals, and we have recently followed this helix tilt sampling approach to find evolutionary conserved models of the transmembrane homooligomers of coronavirus envelope protein E. 27 In the present work we have studied, without the help of any experimental restraint, the transmembrane homooligomeric interactions of integrins using an exhaustive global search, 28 but sampling the helix tilt at 5\u00b0intervals, and using the integrin transmembrane sequence of 27 \u2423 subtypes and 14 \u2424 subtypes of integrin.

These averaged low-energy structures are indicated with symbols here, and are plotted on a plane described by helix tilt and rotational orientation for an arbitrarily chosen residue (here 33 ). After considering the results from all sequences tested, a \"complete set\" is a group of these structures that contains representatives from all sequences. Hence, the backbone structure obtained by averaging converging structures for different homologs is not destabilized by conservative mutations. In this figure, the location of two \"complete sets,\" corresponding to \u2423 homodimeric models I and II (see Results), are indicated by gray squares.

As for the homodimers, when search was extended to other \u2424 sequences, the first model (model I) was conserved in all instances.

For example, the helix tilt for our \u2423 homodimeric model I [see Fig. 4 (a)] is 19\u00b0, which corresponds to a crossing angle of 38\u00b0for a symmetric dimer. This is remarkably consistent with a \"model I-like\" \u2423IIb homodimer proposed by W.F. DeGrado and coworkers based on an exhaustive search of rigid-helix interactions and mutagenesis data 17 where a modified motif, VGxxGG instead of GVxxG for GpA, was proposed. In the model I we report, residues G972 and G976, that pertain to the GxxxG motif (see residues 28 and 32 in Fig. 1 , top panel) interact with V969 and V973 of the other helix (number 25 and 29 in Fig. 1, top panel) . Also, mutations at L980, L980A, and L980V, which have been reported to greatly increase homodimerization 17 are involved in the interaction. In contrast to this latter report, 17 however, calculations of the interaction energy per residue (Fig. 6) in the \u2423IIb dimer model I do not show that the residues preceeding G in the GxxxG motif (i.e, residues V971 and G975) are important for the interaction. Our results for model I are therefore more consistent with a typical GpA type mode of interaction in all integrins. The discrepancy between these results may be due to the different strategy used and the ambiguity in mutagenesis studies; for example, G975L or G975V was found to impair dimerization, but G975A was as dimerizing as the native residue. 17 Small details aside, because we find that this homodimeric model I has been conserved through all integrin types, the model described for \u2423IIb 17 is just a particular instance of a more general Fig. 5 . Summary of the transmembrane integrin homomeric interactions found in our computational work. All homooligomers are right handed. The scheme represents the models of interaction found for homodimers and homotrimers in \u2423IIb (a) and \u24243 (b). Each helix is represented by two halves. For \u2423IIb, the two Gly residues in the GxxxG-like motif, G972 and G976, are located in one of the halves. Residue W967 is located at an opposite location, in the other half (see text). For \u24243, the two small (Gly) residues in the GxxxG-like motif, residues S and A, are located in the same half, whereas G708 (and M701) is at an opposite orientation, in the other half. form of interaction that includes all \u2423 representatives, as has been also suggested by experiments involving other integrin TM domains. 16 The mode of interaction of \u2423IIb in the \u2423/\u2424 heterodimer (\u2423IIb/\u24243) has been described for the inactive state, 11 with the residues at the G position in the GxxxG-like motif participating in helix-helix contacts; in contrast, residue W967 points away from the \u2423/\u2424 interface. Interestingly, mutation W967C resulted in the formation of a (\u2423IIb/\u24243) 2 species, a dimer of dimers, through formation of a disulfide bond. 11 This suggests that in this particular case, interaction between \u2423IIb chains is GxxxG-like motif independent [similar to our model II of interaction, Fig. 4(b) ]. Our computational results show that this form of interaction is neither accidental nor specific to \u2423IIb, because we have found it to be evolutionarily conserved across all integrins. Coexistence of heterodimer and \u2423 homodimer is therefore possible taking model II into account, as it has also been suggested earlier. 33 ",

            "text": "Our results provide an explanation for seemingly conflicting reports in in vivo and in vitro transmembrane homomeric interaction of integrins. We have found that two modes of interaction are evolutionarily conserved. One of these interactions (model I) involves the GxxxG-like motif, which has been proposed previously on the basis of mutagenesis data in the transmembrane domains. The other model (model II) involves the opposite face of the helix, which is consistent with previous experimental data. Because our models have been obtained with independence of any previous experimental restraint and only using the perturbing effect of evolutionary conservation data as a filtering parameter, we suggest that these interactions are present in vivo. The present studies provide a fertile ground for experimentation. We are presently studying the in vivo effects of these potentially disruptive mutations in the integrin transmembrane domain.",
