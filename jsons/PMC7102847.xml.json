The novel virus belongs to the coronaviruses family which is responsible for causing mild to moderate colds. MERS-Co is blamed for causing severe acute respiratory illness that lead to death in many cases. According to [1], MERS-CoV symptoms include: cough, fever, nose congestion, breath shortness, and sometimes diarrhea. The virus began spreading rapidly in Saudi Arabia in 2013. Since then, the Control and Command Center of Saudi Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia started recording and reporting the cases. The ministry website provides daily statistics on new confirmed MERS-CoV cases, recoveries, and deaths.",

For heart disease diagnoses, Venkatalakshmi and Shivsankar [5] compared the performance of decision tree algorithm and Naive Bayes. The experimental results using a dataset of 294 records with 13 attributes showed that the performance of the two algorithms is comparable. FP-growth, Association rule mining, and decision trees were used for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer [6]. The classification models were built using a dataset of 699 records and 9 attributes and the best accuracy was achieved using decision trees induction algorithms.",

[7] used Naive Bayes, back-propagated neural network, and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm to predict the survivability of breast cancer patients. The dataset used in the study was obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). Experimental results indicated that the C4.5 algorithm outperformed the other two techniques. Recently, several predictive models for breast cancer survival were developed [8]. The models were based on a dataset of 657,712 records and 72 variables, also obtained from SEER. Three different data mining techniques were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes Networks, and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). Results showed that the best survival prediction model was obtained using SVM. The authors in [8] presented a study of predictive models for breast cancer survival. The main goal was to discover important attributes that contribute to breast cancer survival. Three data mining techniques were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes Net, and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). Experiments on a dataset obtained from SEER showed that the SVM model outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. SVM was able to identify ten attributes that are important indicators of breast cancer survivability. Sandhu et al. [9] proposed a cloud-based MERS-CoV prediction system. The system is based on Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) for initial classification of patients. A geographic positioning system is utilized to represent patients on Google Maps. Patients classified as infected were tracked using GPS from their mobile phones. The proposed system is useful to citizens since it allows them to avoid infected areas. In addition, healthcare authorities can manage the infection problem more effectively. The BBN achieved an accuracy of 83.1% on synthetic data.",

In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group consisted of recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV.
