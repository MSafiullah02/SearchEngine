In Figure 1 , the sites for chemotherapeutic intervention are highlighted for amantadine, siRNAs (short interfering RNAs) and neuraminidase inhibitors. Here we will review the different anti-influenza virus agents in function of their interaction with the different targets within the viral replication cycle.",

            "text": "Inhibition of binding HA to the epithelial cells could be an efficient means of blocking infection. The crystal structure of HA complexes with various derivatives of sialic acid has been determined. 11 Such knowledge has led to a rational design of carbohydrate-based inhibitors of HA. 12 Collectins also bind to the viral HA and probably prevent infection by interfering with the cellular binding activity of HA. 13 The most effective strategy has been to take advantage of the nature of the interaction of the virus with its receptor, which depends on the thermodynamic advantage offered by engaging in multiple simultaneous binding interactions. Whilst bivalent sialic acid ligands provide some advantage, the most potent and effective sialic acid receptor antagonists that have shown activity in vitro incorporate sialic acid moieties onto polymeric templates, [14] [15] [16] a strategy used advantageously by nature. 17 The structure and physical properties of the template employed to project the sialic acid residues are of importance, and hydrophobic components appear to be necessary for high affinity binding. For example, the heptasaccharide derivative 5, a rather complex bivalent ligand, inhibits influenza virus adsorption to erythrocytes (hemagglutination) with an IC 50 of 0.18 mM, 18 whereas the structurally simpler dimeric ligand 2 inhibits hemagglutination with an IC 50 of 3 mM. 12 Branched, dendrite like amino acid backbones capped with sialic acid moieties afforded molecules that cluster 4, 8, or 16 residues and are effective inhibitors of hemagglutination of erythrocytes. 19 An alternative approach has focused on the incorporation of differing concentrations of the sialoside lipid 4 into liposomes, followed by irradiation-induced polymerization. 20 Following synthetically convergent methodology, three different families of compounds of varying linker span length were generated. Peracetylation of methyl-N-acetyl-b-D-neuraminate 21 afforded 8, which in turn was converted into Sialoside 7 by treatment with 5-hexen-1-ol and Hg(CN) 2 followed by oxidation with KMnO 4 (Scheme 1).",

A series of podocarpic acids interact with HA at neutral pH and prevent the low pH-induced change to the fusogenic conformation. These compounds are similarly effective against H1 and H2 influenza viruses but are less active against H3 or influenza B viruses. In mice infected with a lethal challenge of influenza A compounds LY313177 30b and LY311912 30c gave survival rates of 90% and 80%, respectively, with intraperitoneal doses of up to 200 mg/kg bid for 8 days. 37 The novel antiviral protein cyanovirin-N (CV-N) was initially discovered based on its potent activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Remarkably, however, CV-N and related homologs showed highly potent antiviral activity against almost all strains of influenza A and B virus, including clinical isolates and a neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strain (EC 50 \u00bc 0.004-0.04 mg/ mL). When influenza virus particles were pretreated with CV-N, viral titers were lowered significantly (>1,000-fold). Further studies identified influenza virus hemagglutinin as a target for CV-N, showed that antiviral activity and hemagglutinin binding were correlated, and indicated that CV-N's interactions with hemagglutinin involved oligosaccharides. 38 However, all of the fusion inhibitors appear to have a narrow spectrum of activity against H1, H2, or H3 influenza A viruses.",

            "text": "Determination of the molecular mechanism of action of the adamantanes has allowed rational development of additional inhibitors of the M2 ion channel. 39 Amantadine 35 (1-adamantanamine) has been established as effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A virus infections. [40] [41] [42] [43] Although initially licensed in 1966, the clinical use of adamantines as been limited by central nervous system (CNS) side effects. 44 Current interest in M2 inhibitors not only led to the development of new, highly potent compounds, but also prompted the optimization of the synthesis of amantadine 35 and rimantadine 36. Koch-carbonylation 46 is known as the transformation from carbon monoxide with alcohols or olefins and water to carboxylic acids. However, the reaction usually has to be carried out under severe conditions such as high CO pressure, high temperature, and strong acidic conditions; therefore much attention has been focused on a convenient and environmentally benign process for this synthetic route. 47 The preparation of non-symmetrical ketons by the reaction of acyl chlorides and the corresponding Grignard reagents in the presence of catalytic amounts of metal halides has been previously described in the literature. The reaction conditions have been optimized to an efficient, cheap and fast method for the preparation of adamantyl ketons. 48 Novel amantadine and rimantadine derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated by Kolocouris et al. [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] These new adamantane derivatives were found to inhibit the replication of influenza Avirus at an EC 50 (50% antivirally effective concentration) of 1.2 mg/mL (spiro[cyclopropane-1,2 0 -adamantan]-2-amine, 37), 49 0.56 mg/mL (spiro[pyrrolidine-2,2 0 -adamantane, 38), 49 0.24 mg/mL (spiro[piperidin-2,2 0 -adamantane, 43), 52 0.6 mg/mL (2-1-adamantanyl)pyrrolidine, 47), 52 53 In all cases, these EC 50 values compared favorably to that of amantadine 35 when evaluated under the same experimental conditions. Bananins 56 (Chart 4) show a close structure relationship to the previously discussed adamantane derivatives. They represent a class of antiviral compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative. The bananins were synthesized by the reaction of phloroglucinol (most likely in its triketo tautomeric form) with aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution. 57 Generally, acidic catalysis was used due to the degradation of pyridoxal under highly basic conditions. Alkaline catalysis was used for reaction with aromatic aldehydes such as vanillin to obtain Vanillinbananin (VBN) 55. Bananin synthesis is driven by the creation of the highly symmetric trioxa-adamantane-triol (TAT) cage system. The prototypical compound of the TAT series, the vitamin B6-derived bananin (BAN) 53 can be iodinated with subsequent oxidation to iodobananin (IBN) 54. The iodine in IBN can be replaced by various substituents as exemplified by the synthesis of adeninobananin (ADN) 56, using an activated adenine nucleobase derivative. Interestingly, BAN 53 is susceptible to Michael addition with the natural product eugenol. This NaOH-catalyzed addition leads to eubananin (EUB) 57, which can be transformed by cyclic hemiketal condensation into the ansa-compound ansabananin (ABN) 58, inspired by ansamycins such as rifamycin and geldanamycin. 58 Newer agents related to M2 function (Chart 6) include norbornylamine 60 59 , a novel spirocompound-BL-1743 (61) and bafilomycin A1 (62), a macrolide antibiotic. ICI 130685 59 60 , has advanced into clinical trials but was not approved for clinical use Chart 6.",

Nevertheless, both the trypsin inhibitor futhan 63 and an anticathepsin B IgG antibody have been shown to possess influenza-inhibitory activity in an in vitro setting. 69, 70 The quinone 64 was identified as a specific inhibitor of the fusion-inducing conformational change (IC 50 \u00bc 250 mM); the hydroquinone form 65 71 proved to be more potent, with an IC 50 of 25 mM.

The polymerase transcription complex of influenza viruses consists of a trimeric structure.

Association of the polymerase with RNA template, which harbors essential and influenza virus-specific sequence motifs, and with the nucleoprotein (NP, RNA binding protein) is required for full transcriptase activity. 74 The polymerase of influenza viruses contains an endonuclease activity that cuts the host cell mRNA at approximately 10-16 nucleotides from the 5 0 -cap. It then uses the capped oligonucleotides as primers for the generation of capped, viral mRNA. The endonuclease is a unique and highly conserved target present in all influenza viruses.",

In MDCK cells, flutimide 67 inhibited influenza virus replication with an IC 50 of 5.1 mM and exhibited no cytotoxictiy at concentrations up to 100 mM. 76 Flutimide 67 is a fully substituted 1-hydroxy-3H-pyrazin-2,6-dione containing the following crucial groups: an N-hydroxyimide, an imine and an exocyclic enamine with Z-geometry. 77 The endocyclic imine may help in the stabilization of the exocyclic enamine via extended conjugation. The synthetic pathway to obtain this compound with these unusual structural features is outlined in Scheme 6.

By this way an effective and selective formation of the 1,2-double bond with simultaneous cleavage of the oxazolidinone system is achieved. TfO is used to introduce a good leaving group. The 4-amino functionality was finally introduced via S N 2-substitution of 113, using sodium azide with concomitant inversion of configuration under mild alkaline conditions. Azide reduction, N-acetylation, Boc-deprotection and the phosphate salt formation gave the final product 101 in 30% overall yield.",

Lewis acid-catalyzed elimination and an intramolecular cyclization reaction yielded the 3a,7adihydro-4H-pyrano [3,4-d] [1, 3] oxazole derivative 129 which, in turn, achieved upon treatment with trimethylsilylazide the azide 130. Deprotection, followed by reduction of the azide function yielded 4-Amino-Neu5Ac2en 131, which could be converted into the desired guanidine derivative 126. 129 A more recent approach to zanamivir 126 is reported starting from D-glucono-d-lactone 132 (Scheme 13). 130 Following reaction of D-glucono-d-lactone 132 with 2,2-diethoxypropane in acetone and methanol with a catalytic amount of p-TsOH the free alcohol function was benzylated to obtain the ester 133. 131 The corresponding alcohol 134 was obtained by reduction of ester 133 with LiAlH 4 . Subsequent treatment with Dess-Martin periodinane gave aldehyde 135 which was further converted into the imine 136. With the help of a highly selective syn addition of allylmagnesium bromide the amine 137 was obtained which further was N-acetylated and simultaneously debenzylated. Finally, a good leaving group at the alcohol function was introduced to obtain 138. 138 could be converted into the aziridine key intermediate 139 by reaction with NaH and THF. Using NaN 3 in EtOH-water in the presence of NH 4 Cl allowed to open the aziridine ring regioselectively at the less hindered position, and the free amino function was acetylated to obtain 140 (structure confirmed by X-ray). The terminal olefin in 140 was efficiently dihydroxylated by catalytic OsO 4 in the presence of NMO in acetone-water to obtain the diol 141. The primary hydroxyl group of diol 141 was selectively oxidized under TEMPO base conditions 132 , the resulting acid was immediately converted into the corresponding ester, whereas the remaining secondary alcohol was oxidized to the a-ketocarboxylic acid methyl ester 142. Treatment with HF in MeCN 133 afforded the sugar derivative 143, which, in turn, was fully acetylated followed by replacement of the a-acetoxyl group with chlorine to obtain 144. 134 DBU-induced elimination reaction afforded 134, the known azide intermediate in the previously described synthesis of zanamivir 126.",

On-site dissociation studies indicate that peramivir 165a remains tightly bound to N9 NA (t1/2 >24 hr), whereas, zanamivir 126 and oseltamivir carboxylate 101 dissociated rapidly from the enzyme (t 1/2 \u00bc 1.25 hr). Additional efficacy studies indicate that a single injection of peramivir 165a (2-20 mg/kg) 161 was comparable to a q.d. \u00c2 5 day course of orally administered oseltamivir 101 (2-20 mg/kg/day) in preventing lethality in H3N2 and H1N1 influenza models. 162, 163 A single intramuscular injection of peramivir 165a was found effective in the treatment of influenza virus infections, and this may provide an interesting lead to be used in case of an influenza outbreak. 164, 165 Compound 166 was found to have an IC 50 value of 28 mM against neuraminidase N2 and 115 mM against N9, which is superior to the DANA series compound having the same functional groups. 166 This mode of binding for the guanidino group is analogous to that observed in the crystal structure of zanamivir (3) with influenza A neuraminidase. 167 The 1-ethylpropylamide, diethylamide, dipropylamide, and 4-morpholinylamide of the 167a group showed very good inhibitory activity (IC 50 \u00bc 0.015-0.080 mM) against the neuraminidase A form, but modest activity (IC 50 \u00bc 3.0-9.2 mM) against the neuraminidase B. Of the 1-carboxy-1-hydroxy derivatives 167b, the diethylamide and the dipropylamide, were also investigated; however, they were less active than the compounds without the 1-hydroxy group. 168 Chart 21. Dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric inhibitors163 and164 of influenza neuraminidase. Synthesis 169 of peramivir 165a (Scheme 14) starts from (\u00c0)-lactam (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5en-3-one 168, which was hydrolyzed with methanolic HCl; the resultant amino ester on reaction with Boc anhydride produced compound 169. Cycloaddition (3\u00fe2) of compound 169 with the nitrile oxide produced from 2-ethyl-1-nitrobutane, phenyl isocyanate, and triethylamine, gave cycloadduct 170 and other isomers (< 10%). Cycloadduct 170 was isolated from the mixture of isomers and was hydrogenated in methanol with an equivalent amount of aqueous HCl in the presence of PtO 2 at 100 psi to give an amine hydrochloride, which was reacted with acetic anhydride to give the corresponding N-acetyl derivative 171. Compound 171 on reaction with ethereal HCl gave deblocked amine 172. Compound 172 on guanylation with pyrazole carboxamidine hydrochloride in DMF in the presence of diisopropylethylamine gave the corresponding guanidino ester, which on hydrolysis with NaOH gave the desired compound 165a.",

            "text": "A-315675 173 is a novel, pyrrolidine-based compound that was evaluated in this study for its ability to inhibit A and B strain influenza virus neuraminidases in enzyme assays and influenza virus replication in cell culture. A-315675 173 effectively inhibited influenza A N1, N2, N9, and B strain neuraminidases with inhibitor constant (K i ) values between 0.024 and 0.31 nM. These values were comparable to or lower than the K i values measured for oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071) 101, zanamivir 126. 170 Performing the coupling reaction of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)pyrrole 178 171 and S-trityl sulfenimine 179 172 with triflic acid (0.8 equiv) in THF/heptane at \u00c040 C yielded 95% of desired isomer 180. 173 Introduction of the cis-propenyl group at C-4 to obtain 181 required a stereoselective trans-addition of the in situ generated propenyl cuprate. Partial reduction of 181 to the hemiaminal with DIBALH was followed by conversion to the a-methoxycarbamate through treatment with PPTS in methanol. Reaction of this compound with TMSCN in the presence of 174, 175 Compound A-192558 174i, is the most potent NA inhibitor in this series (IC 50 \u00bc 0.2 mM against NA A and 8 mM against NA B). The X-ray crystallographic structure of A-192558 174i bound to NA revealed the predicted interaction of the carboxylic group with the positively charged pocket (Arg118, Arg292, Arg371) and interaction of the trifluoroacetamino residue with the hydrophobic pocket (Ile222, Trp178) of the enzyme active site. Surprisingly, the ethyl and isopropyl groups of the urea functionality-induced a conformational change of Glu276, turning the Glu276/Glu277 hydrophilic pocket, which normally accommodates the triglycerol side chain of substrate sialic acid, into an induced hydrophobic pocket. 176 Of the 175 series, Z-propenyl-analog 175q was found to be the most potent inhibitor of both A and B neuraminidases (IC 50 \u00bc 0.020 and 0.030 mM, respectively), whereas the IC 50 s of the other derivatives were found in a range of 0.045-15 mM. 177 Compound 176b was found the most potent of the benzoic acid analog series 176 (IC 50 \u00bc 0.52 mM for influenza A and IC 50 26 mM for influenza B neuraminidases). 178 Novel aand b-amino acid inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase bearing a pyrrolidine moiety, exhibited K i values in the 50 mM range against influenza virus A/N2/Tokyo/3/67 neuraminidase but exhibited weaker activity against influenza virus B/ Memphis/3/89 neuraminidase. Limited optimization of the pyrrolidine series 177 resulted in compound 177a, which was about 24-fold more potent than 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid in an anti-influenza cell culture assay using A/N2/Victoria/3/75 virus. Pyrrolidine analogs in which the aor b-amino groups were replaced with hydroxyl groups were 365-and 2,600fold weaker inhibitors, respectively. These results underscore the importance of the amino group interactions with the Asp 152 and Tyr 406 side chains and have implications for anti-influenza drug design. 179 Commercially available 5-norbornen-2-ol 185 was converted to the protected dihydroxy ketone 186 via standard procedure Swern-Oxidation, dihydroxylation and protection. 180 A Bayer-Villiger rearrangement was carried out so as to obtain 187. The undesired, methylene lactone decomposed completely by treatment with aluminum oxide. Following the preparation of the iodolactone 188, treatment with K 2 CO 3 afforded the key intermediate 189, which was deprotected to 190 and subjected to oxidative ring-opening. This provided the desired THF derivative 191 which was converted into the oxime 192. Reduction by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of Boc-anhydride gave a mixture of two separable acetyl-amino derivatives 193. The more base-labile 5-methylester could selectively be hydrolyzed yielding the monoacid 184a. 181 After protection of the 5-carboxylate group, the 3-carbomethoxyl group of the obtained 184a was hydrolyzed to get 194 and converted into the bromomethyl ketone moiety of 195 via diazomethyl ketone. Condensation of 195 with formamidine in liquid ammonia introduced the imidazole moiety, and upon deprotection the desired compound 184b was afforded.",

Expression of viral glycoproteins hemagglutinen (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and nucleoprotein (NP) on the surface of infected cells, as well as virus-induced cytopathic effects, infectious virus yields, HA production and virus-specific protein synthesis were all reduced. The inhibition was dose-related and dependent on the virus inoculum. Time of addition experiments indicated that viral replication was markedly inhibited when 83 was added 4-5 hr post infection. No inactivating effect on extracellular virus was observed.T-705 (84), 87 a substituted pyrazine compound, has been found to exhibit potent anti-influenza virus activity in vitro (IC 50 \u00bc 1.0 mM (CC 50 >6,370 mM) against influenza A PR/8/34 virus) and in vivo.88 Synthesis 89-91 of T-705 (84) starts from 3-amino-2-pyrazinecarboxamide(85). Following bromination to 86, the 3-amino function is exchanged to a methoxy function. Compound 87 is suitable to undergo a Palladium catalyzed amination reaction (Hartwig-Buchwald reaction92,93 ) with benzophenonimine yielding 88 after subsequent deprotection. Amide 89 is obtained by treatment with MeOH/NH 3 and can be transformed into the fluoro derivative 90 by reaction with sodium nitrite/hydrogen fluoride in pyridine.
