This has led to a new interest in the analysis of viral populations, which, until recently, was usually linked to outbreaks and other health emergencies. Most previous studies paid attention only to those fragments of the viral genome that were of interest from a clinical perspective, for diagnostics, surveillance, or similar applications. Furthermore, most insights into the population genetics of viral populations were drawn from markers likely under the influence of selective forces, thus leading to distorted or biased views of viral population genetics. This situation is rapidly changing, and the availability of complete genome sequences is shifting the perspective from \"population genetics\" to \"population genomics,\" that is, the analysis of the processes and mechanisms that govern the population dynamics of genetic variation at the complete genome level and not only on a portion of it.",

This shift has also benefited from recent methodological and technical advances, which have allowed the combination of different sources of information (temporal, geographical, genetic, and epidemiological) into a comprehensive framework, known as \"genomic surveillance.\" Here, we review the current state of the art in the population genomics of human viruses and its relevance for the surveillance, monitoring, and control of the diseases they cause. Because of their rapid rate of evolution and the serious diseases they produce -AIDS, hepatitis C, Ebola, influenza, among many others -RNA viruses have received most attention until now and abundant information on their population genomics is accumulating.

One defining feature of RNA viruses is their high mutation rates, in the range from 10 \u00c03 to 10 \u00c06 mutations/nucleotide/replication round, which result from low-fidelity replication (Simon-Loriere et al. 2013; Cuevas et al. 2015; Duffy et al. 2008; Sanjuan et al. 2010 ). This also leads to a very high evolutionary rate of 10 \u00c02 to 10 \u00c05 substitutions/site/year. These high mutation rates can be decomposed into several factors or mechanisms with complex interactions such as the fidelity of the RNA polymerase, the capacity for error correction, the propensity of ribonucleic acid to damage, or the edition by hosts' enzymes (Geller et al. 2016; Cuevas et al. 2015) . These high mutation rates might explain the small genome size of RNA viruses (ranging from 3 to 29 kb) because in larger genomes, deleterious mutations would appear at such a high frequency that they would compromise virus survival (Duffy et al. 2008; Bradwell et al. 2013) .",

However, we must consider that virus evolutionary rates are limited by the frequency of deleterious mutations since virus mutation rates are very close to the error threshold beyond which deleterious mutations are so frequent that they lead to population extinction (Holmes 2003) .

Recombination is also a frequent process in many viruses. In retroviruses, such as HIV, a nonhomologous type of recombination known as copy-choice recombination is common, and it can occur when two different viral strains simultaneously infect the same cell. In this form of recombination, the RNA polymerase \"jumps\" between two copies of single-stranded RNA, which makes up the genome of retroviruses, while it is still attached to the newly synthesized chain. This mechanism occurs only during RNA synthesis and the parental (donor) strand is not physically transferred to the recombined strand. It is likely that secondary structures of the RNA genomes are involved in controlling the \"jump\" between strands (Lai 1992; Negroni and Buc 2000; Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011) .",

Antigenic driftantigenic evolution in influenza A virusexemplifies this phenomenon and should not be confused with genetic drift. Due to the interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, mutations accumulate in antigenic regions encoding surface proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Influenza A viruses show episodic selection, that is, positive selection over long periods interspersed with purifying selection over short time periods. This process might explain the new seasonal antigenic variants of influenza A virus (Rambaut et al. 2008; Cobey and Koelle 2008; McHardy and Adams 2009) .

The ratio of both rates (\u03c9 \u00bc dN/dS) allows different types of selection to be distinguished throughout the viral genome. Under neutral evolution, all mutations are expected to have the same effect (i.e., none or negligible) on fitness, and, thus, \u03c9 will be around 1. Negative or purifying selection reduces dNbecause non-synonymous substitutions lead to changes in the amino acid sequence and thus protein structure or function will likely be affectedwhereas dS should not be affected. Therefore, the ratio \u03c9 will be lower than 1. In contrast, positive selection favors non-synonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions, and, therefore, \u03c9 will be larger than 1 (Cobey and Koelle 2008; Jackowiak et al. 2014) .",

Firstly, the method was originally proposed to analyze selection acting over evolutionary large time scales, because it makes use of the rates of substitution, which implies the replacement and fixation of mutations in populations/species. This is not usually the case in viral populations, where we are dealing with constantly arising polymorphisms that, even when they are deleterious, will segregate in the population before selection removes them. This effect can be controlled for by considering only those mutations that can be mapped onto the internal branches of the phylogeny whereas those at the external branches are excluded from the analyses. Secondly, these tests can be misleading if recombination occurs frequently (Anisimova et al. 2003) , because it may alter the estimates of dN and dS, thus leading to incorrect estimates of \u03c9.",

The former evolve to evade the immune system of the latter, while hosts' immune systems evolve to detect, control, and efficiently eliminate pathogens [the \"Red Queen hypothesis\" illustrates this situation (Van Valen 1973) ]. The strong selective pressures exerted by the hosts' immune systems on viruses, along with their high genomic variability, result in rapid adaptation and constant evolution in coding genome regions involved in interaction with the hosts (Snoeck et al. 2011; Duffy et al. 2008; Kubinak et al. 2012; Jackowiak et al. 2014; Alizon and Fraser 2013) .

These are targets of neutralizing antibodies, CD4 T-cell and CD8 T-cell epitopes (i.e., regions of viral antigen recognized by molecules of the host immune system) (Zanini et al. 2015; Jackowiak et al. 2014 ). However, their relevance has been questioned. For example, CD4 T-cell epitopes seem to be conserved (i.e., under negative selection) in HCV, whereas CD8 T-cell epitopes are under positive selection and, consequently, drive immune evasion in this virus (Cuypers et al. 2016; Pati\u00f1o Galindo and Gonz\u00e1lez-Candelas 2017) . Another example is represented by the mapping of positively selected sites in the HIV genome and by considering different likely targets of selection, such as epitopes recognized by immune system cells, secondary structure of protein and nucleic acids, and particular dinucleotides targeted by antiviral proteins such as APOBEC3G/F (Snoeck et al. 2011 ). Antibody and CD4 T-cell epitopes were found to be under positive selection. However, no positive selection was detected on CD8 T-cell epitopes. Although this observation may suggest an absence of host selective pressures acting on CD8 T-cell epitopes, the authors suggest other explanations. On the one hand, positively selected escape variants without deleterious effects will fix rapidly in the viral population, thus becoming relatively conserved. On the other hand, T-cell epitopes could be under opposite selective pressures over chronic infection.",

These features (including high mutation rates, large population sizes, and recombination or reassortment) facilitate the emergence of de novo resistance mutations. In the absence of drug-selective pressures, resistance mutations may be deleterious or, occasionally, neutral, which implies that their evolution will be governed mainly by genetic drift. For this reason, in the absence of treatment, drug-resistant variants are usually found as minority variants that increase their relative frequency in the population only in the presence of antiviral drugs. Hence, the possibility of transmission of resistance mutations between hosts must be taken into account in order to predict the effectiveness of a particular antiviral therapy. Next-generation sequencing is necessary to detect resistance variants at low frequencies prior to the start of treatment. The development of drug resistance may depend on the presence of various permissive mutations in the same haplotype in order to decrease the genetic barrier (Wilson et al. 2016; Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Chabria et al. 2014) .",

The evolution of HIV since the introduction of early antiretroviral therapies is a good example of this process. Modern treatmentshighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)are more effective than single drug-based early therapies. HAART consists in a customized combination of drugs. Therefore, several resistance mutations are necessary to develop simultaneous resistance against every drug included in the treatment. In contrast, early, single drug-based therapies were prone to the rapid emergence of drug resistance (Smyth et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2008 ). Due to the high efficiency of treatments consisting of different drugs, resistance mutations are uncommon and emerge rarely. Thus, positive selection results in strong selective sweeps that reduce genetic diversity and slow down virus evolution ). The opposite situation was found in influenza A virus resistance to oseltamivir. One of several resistance mutations to oseltamivir (H274Y) underwent rapid and global spread during the influenza seasons between 2007 and 2009. However, the rapid increase in H274Y frequency did not substantially alter the viral genomic diversity. It is perhaps a consequence of emergence of different mutations conferring resistance to oseltamivir (Renzette et al. 2014 ).",

However, gene overlapping leads to hypersensitivity to deleterious mutations (i.e., an increase in the deleterious effects of mutations in overlapping genome regions) as they affect more than one gene. Therefore, strong purifying selection operates in these regions, resulting in a reduced evolutionary rate and adaptation in RNA viruses. Despite this, the negative effects of gene overlapping on evolutionary rate depend on the type of overlapping where internal overlapping (i.e., a single gene that contains another gene within its nucleotide sequence) is associated with stronger negative selection (Simon-Loriere et al. 2013) .",

Nucleotide pairings usually follow the classical Watson-Crick model (guanine-cytosine [G-C] and adenine-uracil [A-U]). As expected, any mutation disrupting Watson-Crick pairs will alter highly conserved RNA secondary structures. Thus, they are often deleterious, and we expect that strong purifying selection operates on Watson-Crick sites, resulting in a reduced rate of evolution. This pattern has been observed in HIV, HCV, and influenza A virus. However, G-U pairs are also stable and they can maintain RNA structures. Although G-U pairs usually show fewer effects on fitness than Watson-Crick pairs, the fitness difference is relatively small. G-U pairs can operate as intermediates between adaptive peaks (i.e., G-C and A-U pairs), thus relaxing negative selective pressures on Watson-Crick sites. Moreover, G-U can remain in the population because, after all, G-U pairs show higher fitness than unpaired nucleotides (Assis 2014) .",

However, H274Y spread rapidly and globally, thanks to two permissive mutations that made the mutant fitness equal to that of the non-mutated genotype in the absence of oseltamivir (Neverov et al. 2015; Duan et al. 2014; Kryazhimskiy et al. 2011) .",

Natural selection favors high mutation rates in viruses as they increase their adaptive capacity, particularly regarding infection, host adaptation, and immune escape. In this light, viral mutation rates might be considered a virulence factor. The presence of local RNA secondary structures in the viral genome may operate as a mechanism of modulation for genome variability. RNA secondary structures flank hypervariable regions, which are prone to low-fidelity replication because they are usually located in single-stranded segments, thus focusing higher mutation rates in genomic regions involved in immune escape (Geller et al. 2016; Cuevas et al. 2015; Duffy et al. 2008; Sanju\u00e1n and Border\u00eda 2011) .",

            "text": "The evolutionary dynamics of genetic diversity in RNA viruses can differ markedly between levels of biological organization, within individuals (intra-host), and at the epidemiological level (inter-hosts). This prominent feature has been analyzed in depth in some viruses that produce chronic or persistent infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, it is also possible to analyze the genetic changes at the intra-and inter-hosts levels in viruses that produce acute infections, such as influenza A virus. Viral evolution during chronic infection occurs simultaneously in different parts of the genome and, depending on the virus, independently in the segments. Hence, it is important to analyze genetic diversity in complete genomes, because different genome regions can be under distinct, even opposed, selective pressures (Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Holmes 2004; Luciani and Alizon 2009; Lythgoe and Fraser 2012; Sobel Leonard et al. 2016) . Viral infections usually start by a founder virus or a population of a few viral units with very similar genomes (Joseph et al. 2015; Jackowiak et al. 2014; Sobel Leonard et al. 2016) . It is unlikely that there is only one genome sequence in the founder population shared by all the viruses. However, among the many variants present in the source individual, the fittest phenotypes for transmission will be more represented in the infecting population. Shortly after the infection, the process known as clonal expansion starts. This process results from the rapid replication of the virus that leads to an increasingly diverse population in which new mutations accumulate from the initial sequence. This genetically diverse population is usually known as a viral quasispecies (Eigen 1996) , a set of highly diverse, evolutionarily close, nonidentical haplotypes (because they derive from the same virus or a reduced population) undergoing diversification, competition, and selection (Chabria et al. 2014; Domingo et al. 2012; Khiabanian et al. 2014) . In later stages of infection, the initially homogeneous viral population will be more diverse. This indicates that, during transmission, there are several bottlenecks that reduce diversity at the interhost level (Gray et al. 2011; Joseph et al. 2015) .",

This is supported by the fact that the same reversions are observed in unrelated individuals. In HIV, some nucleotide substitutions produced during intra-host evolution are reversions to that global consensus sequence (Zanini et al. 2015; Li et al. 2007 ). This trend suggests that in chronic infections, directional natural selection is the main evolutionary force determining the diversity of the viral population. But most mutations are neutral or reduce rather than increase fitness. Nevertheless, in populations with high recombination rates, such as in HIV, adaptation to the host may be concurrent with a sustained exploration of the adaptive landscape. This trend is more evident for globally conserved genome positions, and it can also be observed in viruses producing acute infections (Zanini et al. 2015; Sobel Leonard et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014; Gire et al. 2014 ). However, the number of positions under directional positive selection in the HIV genome is limited. Most of the genome is under purifying selection or accumulates neutral mutations. The action of diversifying selection, which acts in an opposite sense to directional selection, and the emergence of neutral mutations may disguise the convergence toward a global consensus sequence in positively selected positions (Snoeck et al. 2011; Ross and Rodrigo 2002) .",

Intra-host evolutionary rates can be from two to six times higher than those among hosts (Lythgoe and Fraser 2012 ). Viral evolutionary rates show a trend to slow down in the long term. This trend is reinforced by the bottlenecks and selective pressures operating at transmission events (Zanini et al. 2015) .

To explain this difference, we should also take into account that the viral population needs to adapt to the immune system of a specific host after each transmission. Therefore, intra-host evolution is governed by strong, continuous selective pressures leading to fast evolutionary dynamics with high evolutionary rates. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the viral population and the different lineages that can coinfect an individual may affect the action of the immune system and, in consequence, the viral evolutionary dynamics (Grenfell et al. 2004) .",

In HCV, it has been shown that the large differences between intra-and inter-host evolutionary rates in genome regions related to evasion from the immune system can be explained by reversions of host-specific adaptations to genotypes similar to those of the founder virus. The hypothesis of a preferential transmission of slow-evolving lineages seems to be quite unlikely, at least for HCV (Gray et al. 2011) . In other viruses, such as HIV, the contribution of reversions to evolution has not been studied in detail (Zanini et al. 2015) . Another contributing factor is that inter-host evolution is shaped by many bottlenecks produced in every transmission event (Gray et al. 2011; Joseph et al. 2015) , which act reducing the evolutionary rate. As a consequence, phylogenies including isolates serially sampled within patients usually present long external but short internal branches, the latter corresponding to evolutionary changes occurring among patients.",

Consequently, such mutations will be neutral, or selection at the inter-host level may act against them. The viral population evolves at the intra-host level during infection, becoming adapted to each new host. However, genotypes carrying host-specific adaptations do not seem to be the most efficient in being transmitted to new hosts (Alizon and Fraser 2013) . The study of this conflict, known as \"short-sighted evolution,\" was initiated in the last decade of the past century and applied to different pathogens (Levin and Bull 1994) . Although until recently this conflict had been studied at the genomic scale only in HIV, its presence in other viruses such as HCV or Marburg virus has led to question whether this is a common feature of RNA viruses (Gray et al. 2011) . Would it be possible then that less fit variants, presumably purged by natural selection or belonging to minority classes, persist and be transmitted in a population? Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the transmission of those less fit variants (intra-host) to new hosts. For instance, HIV populations \"archive\" resistance variants in latent T-cells, which act as reservoirs of variants that can be transmitted later. Alternatively, mutations reverting to the founder virus, the one initially infecting the host and presumably fitter for transmission (Joseph et al. 2015; Zanini et al. 2015; Jackowiak et al. 2014; Alizon and Fraser 2013; Chabria et al. 2014) , might be transmitted preferentially to variants better adapted to the current host. These mechanisms might help to explain the persistence and transmission of resistance mutations to drugs in untreated hosts because, in an analogous way, resistance mutations usually reduce viral fitness in the host in the absence of selective pressure by drugs (Chabria et al. 2014) .",

The rate of replication of the founder virus is an important factor for the epidemiological success of the disease as well as for the natural history of the viral population in the infected individual. The rate of replication influences the interaction between the viral population and the immune system of the host, which is a key factor determining the outcome of the infection (acute or chronic). The rate of replication is a quantitative trait that also evolves throughout an infection. There are observations of groups of variants in subpopulations, both within and among hosts, with different RNA polymerase activity. Hence, diverse variants with different ranges in their rates of replication can coexist in the same individual (Luciani and Alizon 2009 ). High rates of growth lead to a stronger immune response against the virus. Consequently, at the inter-host level, the prevalence of slow-replicating variants is favored by natural selection, because it allows a longer time of infection in the host and, as a result, maximizes the reproductive number (R 0 ) of the infection. In epidemiology, R 0 is defined as the number of new infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population and is very closely related to the intrinsic rate of growth of a population in ecological models. However, at the intra-host level, variants with a high rate of replication are favored, because they allow a faster exploitation of the host's resources.",

Its higher sensitivity compared to traditional Sanger sequencing allows a deeper analysis of viral diversity, identifying minority variants and rare polymorphisms that, on the one hand, are invisible for classical techniques, which usually involve reconstructing consensus sequences, and, on the other hand, can be very relevant for basic and applied research (Chabria et al. 2014; Khiabanian et al. 2014 ).

In RNA viruses, ecological processes, such as spatial spread, and epidemiological processes occur in a similar time scale to that of evolutionary processes, as a result of their high mutation and evolutionary rates (Holmes 2008) . This makes them very appropriate model organisms to study the dynamics of microevolutionary changes, because these can be observed \"in real time.\" In addition, there is a bias toward studying RNA viruses rather than those with a DNA genome that derives not only from their fast evolution (Duffy et al. 2008 ) but because, in general, they are more relevant in epidemics and emerging diseases (Holmes 2004; WHO 2017) . Avise (2000) defined phylogeography as the field of study concerned with the principles and processes governing the distribution of geographical lineages at the intraspecific level as well as the interspecific level for related species. In other words, from a more applied perspective, phylogeography includes studies using phylogenetic trees to combine genetic data with spatial information and analyze the spatial patterns suggested in these trees (Holmes 2004; Pybus et al. 2015) . Holmes (2004) used a wider definition in which phylogeography incorporates spatial and temporal patterns as well as their interactions. The rapid evolution of viruses can generate enough genetic variation, even at the intra-host level, in just a few days to perform phylogenetic analyses at the infected individual level. This allows applying phylogenetic methods to emerging diseases and to build highly resolved phylogenetic trees (Holmes 2004; Avise 2000; Pybus et al. 2015) . The most basic way to integrate spatial and genetic information consists of localizing cases of infections and associating them to different variants (subtypes, genotypes, etc.) of the diseasecausing virus (Pybus et al. 2015) .",

The molecular clock is a statistical model that establishes a relationship between time and genetic distances in nucleotide sequences. If samples are identified with known dates, then the branching events and the common ancestor in a phylogeny can be placed in a temporal scale. This information can be integrated with spatial information to reconstruct the dispersal history of a virus, linking each branch of the phylogeny with its geographic location. Therefore, with models based on the molecular clock, it is possible to analyze the spread of an epidemic (in months or years) complementing the phylogeny of the isolates with a time scale (Pybus and Rambaut 2009; Pybus et al. 2015) . The simplest models for the molecular clock, also known as \"strict clock\" models, assume a single, constant evolutionary rate for all the lineages. However, more complex, \"relaxed clock\" models have incorporated variation in the evolutionary rate among lineages or through time (Drummond et al. 2006) .",

However, the analysis at the genome level is very important to obtain a more complete and unbiased information. Mechanisms such as recombination and reassortment may generate genomes in which different portions thereof have different evolutionary histories (Rambaut et al. 2008; McHardy and Adams 2009; Holmes 2004; Pybus et al. 2015) , and this has to be considered when analyzing complete genomes. Nextgeneration sequencing methods have advanced to the \"subnucleotide\" level in the analysis of viral sequences. This implies considering the infected individuals as viral populations rather than repetitive collections of the same consensus genome and, additionally, detecting variability within individuals, even very low-frequency variants (subclonal variants). Studying the intra-host and subclonal variability can improve the resolution of phylogenetic analyses and, when combined with epidemiological information, provide a very valuable information to track transmission chains during an outbreak, especially when the transmission rate is very fast, even higher than the viral evolutionary rate (Emmett et al. 2015) .",

This is closely related to the density and communication between susceptible populations because for virus transmission, a certain proximity between hosts or hosts and vectors is necessary. The smaller the population size of the host, the less likely transmission will be and, consequently, the more difficult to be sustained long enough to cause acute infections. However, large, dense host populations can easily sustain a virus that causes short, virulent infections. In this context, the analysis of the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is highly relevant. This number depends on several factors, such as the number of contacts with susceptible individuals, the probability of transmission, and the length of the infectious period (Dietz 1993 ). This value is very useful to estimate the speed of propagation of an infection in a susceptible population (Ridenhour et al. 2014) . The interest in estimating this parameter and its application to the analysis of outbreaks and epidemics and the design of public health strategies gained momentum during the influenza A pandemics of 2009 (Fraser et al. 2009; Ridenhour et al. 2014) .",

This is the case for some viruses, such as Ebola virus, with reservoirs in animal species but also capable of being transmitted from person to person. Furthermore, even in RNA viruses well-adapted to humans, there is the possibility of relatively frequent zoonotic contacts, such as in influenza A and MERS-CoV, which are usually associated with the emergence of epidemics and pandemics as a result of genetic exchanges between strains from different species. For vector-borne viruses, we must consider not only human geography but also the geographic distribution of the corresponding vectors, such as different mosquitos of the genera Aedes and Culex, which are vectors for Zika, dengue, or chikungunya viruses.

These can move viruses across geographic barriers and bring into contact with previously isolated populations. This process has contributed to the emergence and reemergence of viral epidemics such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. However, we are just starting to understand the effects of global mobility of people and goods on the genetic diversity and evolution of viruses (Alcala et al. 2016; Pybus et al. 2015) . To better control epidemics and to understand the evolution and ecology of viruses, it will be necessary to integrate spatial and genomic information along with information about human mobility in a single mathematical framework (Pybus et al. 2015) . One example in this direction is BEAST, a framework for Bayesian statistical analysis that allows inference of phylogeographic relationships including spatial and temporal dynamics of migration (Lemey et al. 2009; Drummond and Rambaut 2007) .",

These dates were coincident with several events that brought an important flow of international air traffic to Brazil, such as the 2014 FIFA World Cup (June-July 2014) and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup (June 2013) of football (Faria et al. 2016 ).

Hence, during this period, natural selection and demographic changes, such as expansions and bottlenecks, acting on either the viral or the host population will affect the evolution of the virus. After the viral populations are connected again, gene flow, recombination, or reassortment will influence the evolution of the virus, leading to a \"mixture\" at the genome level. Although selection and demographic changes still act during the reconnection, the other processes act more intensely and rapidly. This mixture impacts on diversity at the genome level: isolated populations have evolved independently, diverging and adapting to the specific conditions of their host populations. After reconnection, the diversity that has accumulated separately increases, which also leads to higher adaptive potential since recombination and reassortment allow the combination of polymorphisms selected in different environments into the same genome. If these polymorphisms are compatible in that particular genomic context, this opens the opportunity for the development of new features which might have not developed (or do so only after very long periods) by just mutation and selection. The second consequence of this shared genetic diversity is a progressive trend toward the homogenization of the populations. Due to the increase in human mobility, these events are expected to be more frequent in the future (Alcala et al. 2016 ).",

Selective pressures acting at the intra-host and inter-hosts levels can differ and often act in opposite directions. Frequently, these selective pressures conflict between the need to adapt to the host and the ability for transmission to other hosts. Those variants that are favored by selection within hostsmutations for evading the immune system and drug resistancemay diminish the capacity for transmission of the virus and, in consequence, will be selected against at the inter-host level. In addition, every transmission event represents a bottleneck that reduces drastically the population size of the virus and, consequently, also its genetic diversity. This leads to slower evolutionary rates at the inter-host level. For instance, in HIV there seems to be an inverse relationship between transmission and evolutionary rate (Berry et al. 2007 ). We must also consider how and by which means is the virus transmitted. Transmission rates are higher in air-transmitted virus, such as influenza A, than in those that use the sexual route. Similarly, those viruses that use arthropod species as vectors have lower rates of evolution, a cost associated to their need for replication in different hosts (Holmes 2004; Woelk and Holmes 2002) .",

            "text": "Another consequence of the high rates of evolution is that ecological and evolutionary processes acting on viral populations occur at similar time scales. Their interaction affects their spatial distribution. The combination of complete viral genomes and phylogeographic methods is very useful for tracking the origin of epidemic outbreaks, locating reservoirs that may act as sources of infection for humans or of new potentially virulent strains (such as influenza A), to reconstruct transmission histories and to monitor the spread of an epidemics. These applications are very relevant nowadays, in an increasingly connected planet in which trade and air traffic bring geographically distant populations close and erase natural barriers for the transmission of diseases. Furthermore, human impacts on previously intact ecosystems are helping the emergence and global spread of new infectious, as illustrated by the recent epidemics of Zika and Ebola viruses.",

            "text": "The development of population genomics is closely linked to advances in sequencing technologies. Standard techniques, based on deriving consensus sequences, miss the presence of minor or subclonal variants (low-frequency polymorphisms) which might be important to understand the dynamics of viral populations as well as the evolution and spread of the disease. Next-generation sequencing techniques allow the detection of rare polymorphisms and minor variants and lead to consideration of infected hosts as viral populations rather than \"collections\" of the same consensus genome. Consequently, these methods provide a better view of viral diversity, which enables an improvement in the study of the epidemiology and evolution of human viruses. A more widespread use of these technologies to characterize genome variation will provide increased information about the intra-host dynamics and the relationship between viral diversity and infection outcome (Liu et al. 2012; Farci et al. 2000) , the inter-host transmission and dynamics (reservoirs for better-transmitted variants), the development of resistance and the failure of antiviral treatments, and the building of highly resolved phylogenies and transmission histories during epidemic outbreaks. In addition, advances in sequencing technologies have also allowed the fast and in-depth analysis of complete genomes. The evolution and accumulation of genetic variation occur differently and simultaneously throughout the genome. Separate regions of the same genome can interact with each other (epistasis) and, even, evolve independently and show different phylogenetic histories. Hence, the possibility of analyzing complete genomesas opposed to the analysis of individual loci or isolated genome regionsprovides a more complete, resolved, and less biased view of genomic variation, the phylogeny and population dynamics of the virus.",
