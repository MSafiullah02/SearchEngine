The stress response is normally adaptive and time limited and improves the chances of the individual for survival. The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by nontranscriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiologic actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function and the immune system. Cortisol increase the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors which is partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent antiinfl ammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils at sites of infl ammation. Cortisol is the most important inhibitor of the transcription of pro-infl ammatory mediators (inhibits NF-kB and AP-1 by multiple mechanisms) [ 1 ] .",

            "text": "The immune status of the host is critical in determining the risk/benefi t associated with corticosteroids therapy. Corticosteroids are likely to compound the immunoparesis in immune-paresed patients increasing the risk of acquired infections. Classic teaching suggests that tissue injury from trauma and surgery results in a systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with \"unbridled infl ammation\" which after a few days/weeks evolves into an immuno-paretic phase known as the compensated anti-infl ammatory response syndrome (CARS) [ 5 -9 ] . However, multiple reports over the last two decades have indicated that the proliferative response to T cell mitogens is signifi cantly impaired in patients and experimental animals immediately after traumatic or thermal injury [ 10 -14 ] . The T-cell dysfunction after traumatic stress is characterized by a decrease in T-cell proliferation, an aberrant cytokine profi le, decreased T-cell monocyte interactions and attenuated expression of the T-cell Receptor Complex (TCR). Furthermore, surgical stress induces a shift in the T-helper (Th)1/Th2 balance resulting in impaired cell mediated immunity [ 15 -17 ] . While the Th1 cytokines may be increased following trauma and surgery, these cytokines do not reach the levels seen in patients with sepsis and unlike patients with sepsis, the Th2 response predominates. As corticosteroids are likely to compound the immuno-paresis following trauma and stress these agents are probably best avoided in the surgical patient who becomes septic. This hypothesis is supported by the failure of corticosteroids to improve outcome in the Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock Study (CORTICUS) study where the majority of patients were surgical patients [ 18 ] . It would therefore appear illogical to give septic post-surgical patient corticosteroids as this is only likely to compound the immunosuppressive state and increase the risk of secondary infections (which is exactly what the CORTISUS study demonstrated). Furthermore, it should be noted that the incidence of CIRCI is very low in surgical/trauma patients. In a 5 year retrospective study of 2,100 trauma patients admitted to an ICU the incidence of CIRCI was only 3.3 % [ 19 ] . Similarly, in an analysis of 1,795 intubated trauma patients, 82 (4.5 %) were diagnosed with adrenal insuffi ciency [ 20 ] . Fann and colleagues performed statistical modeling to predict adrenal insuffi ciency in trauma patients [ 21 ] . In this study 3.3 % of patients admitted to the ICU were diagnosed with adrenal insuffi ciency.",

In this study, patients who died in the ICU following sepsis compared with patients who died of non-sepsis etiologies had biochemical, fl ow cytometric, and immunohistochemical fi ndings consistent with severe immunosuppression. In patients with sepsis, the initial pro-infl ammatory response is followed by three distinct clinical pathways, namely i) homeostasis is restored with return to a \"normal immune status\" ii) patients may develop a prolonged a pro-infl ammatory response with ongoing tissue injury iii) while other patients may progress to a state of immuno-suppression (CARS). It is important for clinicians to be able to accurately determine the patients' immune status before instituting immunomodulating interventions. It is likely that patients who receive corticosteroids late in the course of their disease and have progressed to CARS will suffer adverse sequela from such therapy (see timing below). Future research in sepsis will need to focus on developing tools that can dynamically and in real-time characterize the patient's immune response to allow targeted immune therapy.",

There is ample evidence that early removal of glucocorticoid treatment may lead to rebound infl ammation and an exaggerated cytokine response to endotoxin [ 26 , 35 -42 ] . Experimental work has shown that short-term exposure of alveolar macrophages or animals to dexamethasone is followed by enhanced infl ammatory cytokine response to endotoxin [ 43 , 44 ] . Similarly, normal human subjects pretreated with hydrocortisone had signifi cantly higher TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 response after endotoxin challenge compared to controls [ 45 ] . Two potential mechanisms may explain rebound infl ammation: homologous down-regulation and GC-induced adrenal insuffi ciency. Glucocorticoid treatment down-regulates the GR levels in most cell types, thereby decreasing the effi cacy of the treatment [ 46 ] . Down-regulation takes place at both the transcriptional and translational level, and hormone treatment decreases receptor half-life by approximately 50 % [ 46 ] . In experimental animals, overexpression of GRs improves resistance to endotoxinmediated septic shock while GR blockade increases mortality [ 47 ] .",

Through the association and disassociation of chaperone molecules the glucocorticoid-GR-\u03b1 complex moves into the nucleus where it binds as a homodimer to DNA sequences called glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE's) located in the promoter regions of target genes which then activate or repress transcription of the associated genes.",

Despite multiple guidelines and over 20 meta-analyses, the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sepsis remains extremely controversial with confl icting recommendations.

            "text": "The complications associated with the use of corticosteroids are dependent upon the dose, the dosing strategy and the duration of therapy. In the ICU setting the most important complications include immune suppression, hyperglycemia and HPA axis and GR suppression. Both glucocorticoids and TNF-\u03b1 stimulate muscle catabolism (reviewed in Chap. 32 ). Since glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 it is likely that corticosteroids may limit muscle breakdown during acute illness. This postulate is supported by the fact that patients with ARDS treated with glucocorticoids have signifi cantly increased ventilator free days. In the CORTICUS study neuromuscular weakness was very rarely reported [ 18 ] . While myopathy is common in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids this complication is uncommon with stress dose corticosteroids [ 33 , 55 ] . Similarly, while high dose corticosteroids may impair wound healing this complication does not occur with stress dose corticosteroids. Schreiber et al. reported that the use of corticosteroids in ICU patients was associated with an increased risk of delirium [ 71 ] . In this study the authors were unable to establish a relationship between the dose of corticosteroid and the risk of delirium.",
