It is essential to understand the mechanism of interaction of HLGP and indole derivatives for the design of compounds that have the role of enzyme inhibitor. According to studies conducted in 1986 [42] and 1989 [43], it is possible to allosterically regulate the HLGP conformation by the binding of small molecule effectors and by phosphorylation of Ser14. In 2000, Rath et al. [44] studied the mechanism of interaction of the indole 2-carboxamide derivatives with HLGP, given the extensive research done in previous years [45, 46] on the design, synthesis, and crystallographic calculation of indole-2-carboxamide derivatives. Eventually, they introduced a new allosteric site for binding of indole-2-carboxamide derivatives and HLGP that would serve as the basis for the design of new inhibitors. According to their crystallographic results, the presence of carboxamide and chloroindole moiety has a direct effect on the inhibition of HLGP activity. So, they introduced molecules 2\u20134 as candidates. Due to the molecules 2\u20134, four ligand binding sites of HLGP, and experimental studies (Table 1), molecule 2 was identified as the most active compound. The results of the complexation of molecule 2 with HLGP are shown in Fig. 4. According to Fig. 4, molecule 2 spans the two types of inhibitor sites (NH carboxamide and Cl), thereby increasing the inhibitory activity of this compound. By synthesizing compound 2 and examining its inhibitory activity, IC50 of 6 nM was reported to be decreased compared to the previous samples (Table 1).",

Their binding models showed important aspects of the inhibitor\u2019s conformation, subsite interaction, and hydrogen bonding. They used the results of the study by Hoover et al. [45] and incorporated compound 5 as the basis for docking and 3D-QSAR calculations. According to their experimental results (Table 2), compound 6 was identified as the most active compound and entered into molecular docking and 3D-QSAR calculations. According to Table 2 and the data obtained by Liu et al., there is a significant relationship between the binding free energies (\u2206G) and the inhibitory activities (IC50) of the derivatives studied. In other words, the more favorable the interaction energy of the indole 2-carboxamide derivatives with HLGP, the inhibitory potency increases. By comparing the IC50 values of derivatives 5\u201314, it is found that the role of the X, R substitutions, and the chiral centers in the activity of these compounds are crucial. In Fig. 5, graphical results of the interaction of compound 6 and HLGP are shown. According to the results of docking calculations, the presences of indole ring and carboxamide moiety have a decisive role in the inhibitory activity of these compounds. The carboxamide moiety is very flexible and has both hydrophobic and polar properties. There are three hydrogen bonds between the indole derivatives and HLGP. According to Fig. 5, the first hydrogen bond is related to the interaction of indole nitrogen with the backbone carbonyl of Glu190. The second hydrogen bond is the result of the interaction of the carboxamide nitrogen with the backbone carbonyl of Thr380, and the third hydrogen bond is the interaction of the carbonyl in R moiety and the nitrogen atom of the Lys191 side chain. In 3D-QSAR calculations, they used COMFA and COMSIA methods that had similar results and confirmed the results of molecular docking calculations.",

            "text": "According to the research conducted up to 2008, the presence of carboxamide moiety in the indole derivatives is essential for their inhibitory activity against HLGP. In 2008, Onda et al. devoted their research to adding different groups to the carboxamide moiety [26]. They put compound 15 as the basis for the design of new molecules, according to a study by Martin et al. in 1998 [46]. Their main purpose was to replace the phenylalanine group of compound 15 with substituents having the hydroxy group. Accordingly, they synthesized indole 2-carboxamide derivatives and examined their inhibitory activity against HLGP (synthesized according to the route e). The results of their study in Table 3 show that the presence of hydroxy group(s) and their appropriate position, a fluoro group, and nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring increases the inhibitory activity of the compounds studied. It can be concluded that steric hindrance is more important than electronic character in determining the inhibitory activity of indole 2-carboxamide compounds. According to their studies and the evaluation of Table 3, compound 19 was identified as the most active derivative, so was examined for inhibition of glucagon-induced glucose output in cultured primary hepatocytes and for oral hypoglycemic activity in diabetic db/db mice. Their results showed that compound 19 inhibited glucose output dose-dependently with an IC50 = 0.62 \u00b5M. Interestingly, with the administration of 50 mg/kg dose of compound 19, the blood glucose level significantly decreased at 2 h postdose. The calculations of the binding interaction of compound 16 with HLGP are shown in Fig. 7. According to Fig. 7, in addition to the amide moiety interaction with the backbone of Thr380, two hydroxyl groups have direct electrostatic interactions with the imidazole ring of His57 and the backbone of Tyr185. This is important the presence of the carboxamide group in two respects: 1) the interaction of the carboxamide group with the backbone of Thr380, 2) the polar groups attach to it, and the interaction of these groups with His57 and Tyr185 (Fig. 6).",

Their strategy was to create fused rings to benzene carboxamide. During the biological evaluation, they found that the presence of large rings, such as 7-membered rings, caused steric hindrance, which interfered with the interaction of His57 with hydroxy groups and decreased inhibitory activity. It should be noted that adding methyl and hydroxy groups to the fused ring reduces the activity of these compounds, which can be attributed to the steric hindrance and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The presence of fluorine atoms in the fused ring strengthens the inhibitory activity of the indole derivatives. According to Fig. 7, the steric hindrance around the central benzene ring is low and small substitutions such as fluorine can be added to the benzene ring [26]. According to their biological evaluation, compound 21 was identified as the most potent inhibitor with IC50 = 0.02 \u00b5M (Table 4). Considering IC50 = 0.02 \u00b5M for compound 21, further research in diabetic model mice has revealed some interesting points about this compound. Compound 21 showed an inhibition glycogenolysis value equal to 0.69 \u00b5M. The important thing about this compound is that the dose used to reduce plasma glucose level at 2 h postdose is 10 mg/kg. In summary, the data obtained is not sufficient to nominate a drug for more advanced research and requires more complete data. Therefore, they measured other properties of compound 21, such as pharmacokinetic profile, oral bioavailability, plasma half-life which were acceptable in male SD rats. The question that arises is why does the R-enantiomer have higher inhibitory activity than the S-enantiomer? To answer this question, they performed docking calculations using compound 21 (R-isomer) and HLGP. According to Fig. 9, the cause of the high activity of compound 21 is due to the lipophilic interactions of aliphatic fluorine atoms and the hydrophobic residues, such as Phe53, Pro188, and Gly186. The difference in the inhibitory activity of R and S enantiomers, according to Onda et al., is related to the inappropriate interaction of fluorine at position 1 and the methylene group at position 8. But the important thing about reducing inhibitory activity is associated with the inappropriate interaction of aliphatic fluorine groups and hydrophobic residues of HLGP. The fluorine and hydroxy groups in S-isomer have steric hindrance and thus do not interact with Phe53, Pro188, and Gly186 (Fig. 8).",

RT is a key step in the life cycle of retroviruses that is responsible for the synthesis of double-stranded (ds) DNA from a viral single-stranded (ss) RNA genome. Therefore, drugs designed to inhibit HIV-1 virus are divided into several categories: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PI), and integrase inhibitors (INI) [48]. The main purpose of the design of HIV-1 inhibitors is to suppress the replication of HIV-1 in the long-term therapy and to maintain the function of the immune function [49]. Given that delavirdine [50] with indole 2-carboxamide skeletal is used to treat HIV-1, other indole 2-carboxamide derivatives have the potential to inhibit HIV-1 virus activity. It should be noted that many researchers have used nevirapine and efavirenz as the control to compare with indole 2-carboxamide derivatives (HIV-1 inhibition). In the following, the mechanism of action of indole 2-carboxamide derivatives and their structure\u2013activity relationships are discussed.",

Their study showed that this compound is one of the most potent and selective NNRTIs inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [51]. Of course, the main problem of compound 22 is its low solubility in water. In 2003, Silvestri et al., according to the previous research [51], designed and synthesized novel indolyl aryl sulfones and tested them against HIV-1 in acutely infected MT-4 cells [22]. The purpose of their study was to investigate the structural changes in the compounds studied. They used the strategy of replacing the carboxamide group to carboxy hydrazide to increase the solubility of compound studied, which reduced their activity. They modified the carboxamide side chain and examined its shift from position 2 to position 3. The results of their study showed that shifting the carboxamide moiety from 2 to 3 positions or switching it to 2-carboxy hydrazide reduced activity. Finally, the results of their research clearly showed that the anti-HIV-1 activity of the investigated compounds was dependent on the presence of benzene sulfonyl and carboxamide moiety. As a general result, sulfone derivatives have lower cytotoxicity and higher activity potential than sulfur derivatives. They found that the best results were obtained when 3-benzene sulfonyl indoles contained 2-carboxamide moiety. The ester and hydrazide residues were less active, and carboxylic acid inactivated. Given the results of their cell-based assays and the lack of inhibition of the rRT carrying the K103 mutation, it can be said that the compounds studied target the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Fig. 10).",

In their study, they used compound 22 as the reference compound in the interaction with 14 RTs [52]. They used the structural data of 14 RTs (pdb codes: 1DTQ, 1DTT, 1EET, 1FK9, 1HNI, 1HNV, 1JLQ, 1RT1, 1RT3, 1RT4, 1RT5, 1RT7, 1VRT, and 1VRU) to explore the binding mode of the compound 22. These codes represent different non-nucleoside binding sites related to reverse transcriptase. In docking calculations, in all cases, the docked conformations were in agreement with each other, the graphical result of which is shown in Fig. 12. The interesting point about the carboxamide function in position 2 of the indole ring is that the amide carbonyl group is in some instances with indole NH in cis-state and some cases in the trans-state. So they used 3D-QSAR calculations to design new molecules that would have the proper hydrogen interactions at the carboxamide position. They used the data of Silvestri et al. [22] in their calculations. According to the calculations, 2-hydroxyethylaminocarbonyl and 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinocarbonyl substitutions were attached to carboxamide. The selected derivatives were synthesized, and their activity against WT HIV-1 and mutant strains evaluated (Table 6). According to Table 6, molecules 22, 24, and 25 have relatively good activity against WTIIIB compared to NVP and EFV. The important point about double mutant K103N-Y101C is that molecule 25 has higher activity than molecules 22 and 24.

The results of their study showed that compounds 26\u201329 had relatively good activity against WT HIV-1. In their study, they used HIV-1 clades in PBMC cells to measure the inhibitory activity of molecules 26\u201329 in primary T-lymphocyte cells. Table 7 shows that these compounds have high inhibitory activity in primary T-lymphocyte cells. Molecular docking calculations of the synthesized compounds showed that the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen atom in the carboxamide chain and Glu138:B of NNBS-HIV-1-WT RT plays a key role in controlling the activity of these compounds. Considering the structure of compounds 26\u201329, it can be said that the presence of 5 and 6-membered rings without steric hindrance enhances the activity of these compounds. The presence of a nitrogen atom in these rings that cause hydrogen bonding is one reason for the increased activity of these compounds. For further studies on compounds 26\u201329, parameters such as cytotoxicity, selectivity index, and relative factor were measured that were acceptable (Fig. 14).",

            "text": "Renin or angiotensinogenase system is known as the blood pressure regulator as well as its electrolytes. Lowering blood pressure, reducing circulatory volume, or lowering plasma sodium concentration activates the renin system. This pathway is first activated by the aspartyl protease enzyme, which eventually produces angiotensin I by hydrolysis of the angiotensinogen protein [55, 56]. Since renin is the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, and since angiotensin has been recognized as the sole agent, a very effective anti-hypertensive strategy is to prevent angiotensin I production through renin inhibition [57]. If the renin-angiotensin system is abnormally activated, blood pressure will rise too. Based on decades of efforts to discover renin inhibitors, several research groups have reported different renin inhibitors [58]. Renin inhibitors are one of the main ways to lower blood pressure, treat heart failure and have adverse effects on diabetes. Indole 3-carboxamide derivatives are very useful in inhibiting renin enzyme activity, which will be discussed further.",

According to Fig. 15, NH- piperazine with residues Asp32 and Asp215 appeared to form ionic hydrogen bonding interactions. Another interaction is related to the hydrogen-bonding between carboxamide oxygen and Thr77-O\u03b3H. Due to the structural properties of compounds 31 and 32, other indole 3-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized, and their inhibitory activity was investigated. Finally, compound 33 was selected as the most optimal compound in interaction with the renin enzyme (Table 8). Compound 33, with the 5-hydroxy group, establishes a favorable interaction with the imidazole ring of His287 (Fig. 16). According to the results of the crystallographic studies, the presence of polar moiety in the indole core has a positive effect on the inhibition activity of the renin enzyme. Therefore, in their next study, they used azaindole as the base compound. Nitrogen atoms were positioned at the positions of 4, 6, or 5, 7 indole molecules. According to the results of their study, the activity of azaindole and indole compounds against the renin enzyme is similar. They used their candidate compounds in further study to measure factors such as Caco-2 permeability, physicochemical data, and IC50 values in human or mouse plasma. The results of their studies showed that some azaindole derivatives have the potential of intestinal absorption. Therefore, the results of their study can serve as the basis for the initiation of advanced research [59, 60].",

            "text": "In 2012, Jing et al. used the ASSP method to quantitatively characterizing the nonbonding interaction profile between renin and indole 3-carboxamide derivatives [61]. In this method, the space containing the entire active site of renin is divided into thousands of small areas, and then the nonbonding potentials between renin and indoles are calculated. The advantage of the ASSP method is the use of graphical diagrams that illustrate the interactions. Their calculations were performed using the data of the paper by Scheiper et al. [32]. According to the results of their calculations, the interaction of indole 3-carboxamide derivatives with renin enzyme is primarily electrostatic, secondly hydrophobic, and thirdly steric (Fig. 17). The presence of polar and charged groups in the interaction with the renin enzyme causes hydrogen bond and salt-bridge networks. The presence of aromatic and aliphatic rings causes steric and hydrophobic interactions that are weaker than electrostatic interactions. According to their calculations, compound 33 had the highest activity against renin (Fig. 17). The activity of compound 33 depends on the presence of NH in the piperazine ring, C=O/\u2013OH groups, F, and CH3 groups, which enhance the electrostatic force and thus increase its activity. Removal of any of the above-mentioned groups results in a decrease in the activity of this compound. These results confirm the research of Scheiper et al.",

By reviewing the synthetic methods, it was found that BOP, EDCI, HOBt, and TBTU activate the carbonyl group and convert the indole carboxylic acid to indole carboxamide. The studies have shown that indole 2-carboxamide derivatives have inhibitory activity against HLGP and HIV-1, and indole 3-carboxamide derivatives have inhibitory activity against renin. Considering the studies of investigating the inhibitory activity of indole derivatives, the presence of carboxamide moiety at positions 2 and 3 is significant from two aspects. 1) NH and CO-carboxamide form hydrogen bonds with enzymes or proteins. 2) Polar groups can bond to the carboxamide moiety and form new hydrogen bonds with enzymes or proteins. In fact, strengthening the electrostatic forces increases the inhibitory activity of indole 2 and 3-carboxamide derivatives. Research on indole compounds is not limited to academic articles and studies. Many of these derivatives are in the final stages of approval and entry into the pharmaceutical industry. Table 9 shows the indole 2 and 3-carboxamide derivatives, which are in the late stage of discovery. The result of years of research by scientists has shown that these compounds have the potential to inhibit the activity of various enzymes such as HLGP, HIV-1, and renin.
