Full details of item generation for the prototype are described in the Supplemental Methods (available on line at www.fertstert.org) and briefly presented here. As shown in Table 1\n, item-generation involved four stages: generating potential items; eliminating redundant, irrelevant and outlier items; validation among people with fertility problems; and cross-cultural survey of acceptability and feasibility. A comprehensive literature review and consultation with psychosocial infertility experts generated an initial pool of 302 items on consequences of fertility problems on QoL in 14 areas (e.g., marriage/partnership, social network, emotions, cognitions, coping, treatment, physical health). The authors classified the 302 items into three levels of increasing concept specificity\u2014dimensions (e.g., interpersonal), domains (e.g., partner relationship) and facets (e.g., intimacy)\u2014to form groups of items tapping into related aspects of QoL. Classification and subsequent focus groups reduced this pool to 102 items, which were submitted to the acceptability and feasibility study (Table 1). The prototype evaluated in the present study included these 102 core items and 27 optional treatment items identified through the feasibility and acceptability phase.",

Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to identify the best items for each a priori domain of QoL (e.g., emotional, mind/body, relational, social). This a priori work was done to ensure that conceptually similar groups of items were entered into the factor analysis. Factor analyses (orthogonal rotation) were computed (clinic, online) to ascertain relations among these items. Items with factor loadings <0.30 and eigenvalues <1 were eliminated. The FertiQoL total and subscale scores were computed and transformed to scaled scores and summary statistics (e.g., reliability coefficient, mean, SD) produced. Scaled scores were computed to achieve a range of 0 to 100, making comparisons between scales easier. For scaling, items were reverse scored where necessary and all items then summed and multiplied by 25/k, where k was the number of items in the desired subscale or total scale. Higher scores mean better QoL. For the sake of brevity, only final analyses are shown here. These analyses generated the final FertiQoL, which comprised 24 core items, plus 10 optional treatment items. The final FertiQoL in all languages and with scoring instructions is available online at www.fertiqol.org.",

The 24 core items were conceptualized as reflecting QoL in the emotional, mind-body (i.e., cognitive and physical), relational, and social domains. The 10 optional treatment items were conceptualized as indexing treatment environment and treatment tolerability. An additional two items measuring satisfaction with QoL and physical health were retained for the FertiQoL measure to indicate general physical and QoL satisfaction, but they were not included in the factor analysis.",

FertiQol is a reliable and sensitive measurement tool for QoL in individuals with fertility problems. More than 2,000 people with fertility problems contributed to the creation of FertiQoL, and it was developed by using an integrated mixed-methods approach that included literature reviews, international expert consultations, patient focus groups, a cross-cultural feasibility and acceptability survey, and a psychometric survey evaluation. FertiQoL comprises a Core module evaluating the impact of fertility problems on emotional, mind-body, relational, and social domains, and an optional treatment module evaluating treatment environment and tolerability. Subscales and total scales show mainly high reliability and sensitivity of FertiQoL to well established moderators of QoL. FertiQoL is available in 20 languages with more translations in progress. This project was fully realized as a result of collaboration among ESHRE, ASRM, and Merck, Geneva, Switzerland (an affiliate of Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). It is expected that FertiQoL will significantly contribute to future research and clinical endeavors aimed at investigating and ultimately improving quality of life in people with fertility problems.",

First, despite the multidisciplinary contributions from experts worldwide, focus groups, and a feasibility and acceptability study in 10 countries, the final psychometric evaluation occurred in only five English-speaking countries. Second, targeted efforts to recruit a diverse group of people were not entirely successful for particular subgroups (namely, secondary infertility, men). Indeed, more psychometric research on men is required to fully establish reliability and validity. Third, the major proportion of the final sample was recruited online, and differences between the online and clinical samples were observed. Although data generated online has been shown to be as valid as data collected through traditional methods 15, 16, one would need to determine whether the differences observed warrant more in-depth analysis, for example, a different set of norms for clinical samples. We eliminated records coming from the same IP address, but it may be possible that the same person replied more than once to the survey. Finally, the subscales of the Core FertiQoL were not entirely orthogonal with cross-loadings on the social and mind/body domains. Because these associations were expected, we have now modified the final wording of four FertiQoL items to reduce these cross-loadings. Further evaluation of these changes and FertiQoL as a whole on a new sample is required for final validation. These main limitations should be addressed in future psychometric research evaluating FertiQoL. However, the strengths of our mixed-methods approach and consultation with and evaluation from infertile people ensures that FertiQoL captures the key life domains affected by fertility problems. It is hoped that FertiQoL will become a gold standard for the measurement of QoL for individuals experiencing fertility problems, whether in treatment or not.",

The availability of FertiQoL in 20 languages will facilitate essential cross-cultural research particularly in developing nations 18, 19.
