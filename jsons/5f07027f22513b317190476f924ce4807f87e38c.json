It has been estimated that approximately 500 million preschool children suffer from acute gastroenteritis worldwide, predominantly in the developing world, and about 5 million of these children die each year due to dehydration and other complications (Grant, 1987) . Cumulative data from epidemiological studies show that approximately 20-50% of these cases are attributable to known bacterial or parasitic pathogens (Wanke et al, 1987) , which suggests that viruses might be responsible for the remainder. In fact, viral gastroenteritis has been found to be the second most common clinical entity in developed countries, following closely behind viral upper respiratory tract illness (Kapikian et al, 1980) . A number of viruses have now been associated with acute gastroenteritis. These include rotavirus, adenoviruses, Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, and coronaviruses. In this chapter, we will discuss the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the diarrhoea caused by some of these viruses.",

            "text": "In man, the vast majority of information relating to the mechanisms of mucosal injury following rotavirus infection comes from the study of small intestinal biopsies. The major focus was therefore to detect how virus damages these absorptive cells. It has been shown that rotavirus infects the mature enterocytes in the mid and upper villous epithelium (Middleton et al, 1974; Davidson et al, 1975) . Virus particles have also been detected by electron microscopy in goblet cells (Suzuki and Konno, 1975) , in macrophages in the lamina propria (Suzuki and Konno, 1975; Phillips, 1981) and epithelial endocrine cells (unpublished observations, A. D. Phillips). In enterocytes, viral particles are usually found in the distended cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum ( Figure 1 ) and in the cisternae between the inner and the outer nuclear membranes (Bishop et al, 1973) . Rotavirus has also been detected in lysosomal bodies (Suzuki and Konno, 1975; Phillips, 1981) . Enterocytes invaded by rotavirus degenerate. The mic;ovilli are often irregular and distorted, and there is disruption of the terminal web (Suzuki and Konno, 1975) . The number of cytolysosomes is increased. Swelling of the mitochondria and multivesicular and lysosome-like bodies can be observed (Suzuki and Konno, 1975) . Ultimately, cell death and villous atrophy occur. This produces a malabsorptive state as a result of reduced surface area and loss of digestive capacity. Healing of the mucosa occurs within 3-8 weeks (Davidson and Barnes, 1979) . It is possible that during this rapid recovery phase, enteroblast-like cells populate the epithelium. However, in a recent study it has been shown that alkaline phosphatase activity in the virus-infected group was similar to those in controls and: therefore, the enteroblastic replacement theory probably does not hold (Phillips, 1989) .",

Precocious maturation profiles of sucrase and maltase are found but there is no change in the activities of Na-K-ATPase and adenylate or guanylate cyclase (Collins et al, 1988) . However, in these animals significant shortening of villi and increase in crypt depth does not occur (Starkey et al, 1986) . Recently it has been proposed that villous ischaemia causing anoxia and enterocyte destruction is the basis of patho-(4 Stephen and Osborne, 19%). Group B rotavirus is similar to group A rotavirus except that it causes enterocyte syncytia formation (Askaa and Bloch, 1984; Vonderfecht et al, 1984) . Eight-day-old neonatal rats infected with group B rotavirus, develop diarrhoea at 24 h post-infection; however, histology and morphometry reveal that significant villous shortening precedes diarrhoea, occurring at 12 h in the ileum and at 18 h in the jejunum (Figures 2 and 3 ) (Salim et al, 1988 (Salim et al, , 1989a ). Thus, villous ischaemia does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of group B rotavirus infection in rats. Davidson et al (1977) have studied sodium and chloride fluxes in vitro in jejunal epithelium of neonatal pigs infected with a human rotavirus. They found that glucose-coupled sodium transport was severely impaired at the height of diarrhoea. These findings were later confirmed by in vivo studies of 30 cm segments of jejunum of neonatal pigs infected with porcine rotavirus (Graham et al, 1984) . These latter investigators measured the osmolalities of the stools collected from diarrhoeic piglets and concluded that diarrhoea in rotavirus infection in piglets is osmotic due to nutrient malabsorption, of which carbohydrate was the most important (Graham et al, 1986) . The studies of Theil et al (1978) support the view that malabsorption is the primary cause of diarrhoea in this model. However, in vitro perfusion studies in neonatal mice have shown that a secretory state exists in the presence of a glucose-free electrolyte solution, which can be reversed to absorption by the addition of glucose (Starkey et al, 1987) . In the neonatal rat model in vivo, steady-state perfusion of the whole small intestine has shown that water absorption is significantly lower than controls at 12 h post-infection and there is a net secretory state for water from 18 to 48 h (Salim et al, 1989b) . These data correlate well with morphometric findings which showed that mucosal damage antedates the onset of diarrhoea. Colonic salvage of sodium and water probably plays a significant role, such that diarrhoea only becomes evident when the colon is unable to handle the amount of fluid presented to it (Read, 1982) . It has also been shown that net secretion of water is reversed to absorption by glucoseelectrolyte solutions, which concurs with the findings of Starkey et al (1987) . Thus, despite severe damage to the epithelium, glucose-coupled sodium transport remains intact in many animals.",

These viruses cannot be cultivated readily but can be detected by stool electron microscopy, and are called enteric or fastidious adenoviruses (de Jong et al, 1983) . The fastidious adenoviruses are now recognized as being the second most commonly identified agent (after rotavirus) in stools of infants and young children with diarrhoea (Vesikari et al, 1981; Kidd et al, 1982; Yolken et al, 1982; Brandt et al, 1983; Uhnoo et al, 1986) . Despite the growing importance of these viruses, however, the mechanism by which they produce diarrhoea in children is not well characterized and has only been studied comprehensively in pigs. Adenovirus has been detected, however, within the small intestinal mucosa in man. Two cases were studied at autopsy (Whitelaw et al, 1977; Phillips, 1981) giving limited information because of the post mortem changes. Another infant with protracted diarrhoea had a small intestinal biopsy performed when adenovirus (serotype 40/41) was detected in the stools (Phillips, 1989) . The virus was found in the mucosa in nuclei of enterocytes and was present in areas of cell extrusion ( Figure 5 ). The enterocytes containing adenovirus had shortened microvilli and contained an increased number of autophagic vacuoles and polyribosomes. Virus was not detected in crypt epithelium or lamina propria.",

These viruses have been associated with large numbers of outbreaks of gastroenteritis, especially in communities such as schools, colleges, restaurants and even on cruise ships at sea (Greenberg et al, 1979; Kaplan et al, 1982) . However, numerous attempts to infect a wide range of animals including primates have failed to produce clinical disease. Therefore, the information relating to pathogenesis comes from small intestinal biopsies performed before, during and after administration of Norwalk and similar viruses to adult volunteers (Agus et al, 1973; Schreiber et al, 1974) . Following oral administration of the virus, partial villous atrophy with broadening of villi and disorganization of the enterocytes was noted at the height of illness. Dilatation of the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and an increase in multivesiculate bodies inside the enterocytes was observed. Microvilli of infected cells were shortened and the intercellular spaces were widened and filled with amorphous electron dense material. The lamina propria was infiltrated moderately with mononuclear cells. However, virus could not be identified in the infected mucosa, which returned spontaneously to normal within 2 weeks. Schreiber et al (1974) have shown that the intestinal lesions in adult volunteers infected with stool filtrates containing Hawaii agent are similar to those seen with Norwalk virus infection. Some enterocytes were flattened while others contained vacuolated cytoplasm. The intercellular spaces between enterocytes and the lamina propria were infiltrated with mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Similar findings were reported by Dolin et al (1975) who used the same agent for experimental infection of volunteers. The villi returned to normal within 2-3 weeks.",

As these die and are sloughed, the villi become shortened and the crypts hypertrophy. Virus particles were seen in lysosomes of enterocytes and lamina propria macrophages (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977; Snodgrass et al, 1979b; Gray et al, 1980) . In calves, however, the epithelium covering the dome of the jejunal and ileal Peyer's patches is infected (Woode et al, 1984) . The infected cells exfoliate and inflammatory cells migrate on to the surface of the dome. Infected epithelial cells change from columnar to cuboidal in shape, and the lamina propria of the dome villi become infiltrated with increased numbers of neutrophils. The germinal centres are depleted of lymphoid cells centrally while the remaining cells resemble macrophages, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nuclei. However, it is not clear whether infection of the epithelium of dome villi and subsequent depletion of lymphoid cells in the germinal centre affects the immune response. This could have consequences for the natural history of current and subsequent infections.",

Little is known about the ways in which human caliciviruses cause intestinal disease. Flewett and Davies (1976) ) using negative staining electron microscopy, detected calicivirus in a small intestinal sample from a child who had died of acute gastroenteritis. However, experimental infection of calves with a calicivirus, the Newbury agent (Hall et al, 1984) , has shown that the lesions were restricted to the proximal small intestine. Infected cells were swollen, their intracellular organelles were damaged and microvilli were abnormal or absent. The cells degenerate and are ultimately exfoliated. The villi became stunted and sometimes the lamina propria was exposed at the villus tip. There was increased infiltration with inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and the crypts were lengthened. The stunted villi returned to normal by 10 days after infection (Hall, 1987) . However, villous height was increased in the terminal ileum, where no damage occurred. It has been suggested that the gut hormone enteroglucagon might act as a promoter of mucosal growth throughout the small intestine (Hall, 1987) . Plasma enteroglucagon concentrations were found to be increased in calves infected with enteropathogenic viruses but not in calves infected with nonenteropathogenic viruses (Hall et al, 1985) . However, the role of enteroglucagon in man following infection with calicivirus remains uncertain.",

            "text": "In summary, the pathogenesis of many gut virus infections remains uncertain. However, human and animal studies indicate that the majority of gut viruses infect villous enterocytes. Viruses appear to have different affinities for enterocytes at different sites on the villus. Infection of enterocytes leads to cell death, extrusion into the lumen, and villous atrophy when the rate of cell production in the crypts cannot keep pace with the rate of enterocyte loss. This results in a reduced surface area as well as impairment of digestive and absorptive functions. This may also result in a net secretory state. All these changes, along with others such as reduced enzymatic activity and reduced epithelial integrity, may contribute to the induction of an acute but transient malabsorptive diarrhoea which may persist until the digestive/absorptive functions of the enterocyte are restored. However, if colonic compensation is sufficient to handle the increased fluid load, diarrhoea may not be evident. The roles of villous ischaemia, altered countercurrent exchanger or altered immune responses still remain uncertain and require further investigation. ",
