The association between any ARI or a specific respiratory viral ARI and pneumococcal acquisition was assessed using a multivariate random-effects logistic regression model that accounted for those covariates associated with pneumococcal acquisition. Because children were allowed to contribute >1 episode of observation, all analyses accounted for the correlation introduced by the clustering of observations at the subject level (individual study identifiers were used to identify the clusters in the regression models). Acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype was the model outcome, and ARIs or specific viral ARIs were the main study exposures. Absence of an ARI during the observation episode was used as the reference for all comparisons. Secondary analyses included a separate evaluation of the different types of pneumococcal acquisition: from no colonization to colonization, and from colonization to colonization with a new serotype; and an evaluation of individual respiratory viruses, grouping coinfections in a separate exposure category. As routine vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was initiated in the study communities during the conduct of the study, subgroup analyses based on calendar year and pneumococcal vaccination status were also conducted. As some viral infections may affect predominantly young children, separate subgroup analyses stratified by age (ie, infants vs older children) and by daycare attendance were also conducted. Furthermore, to explore whether viral infections may facilitate pneumococcal colonization through the elimination of existing colonizing pneumococcus, we assessed the transition from pneumococcal colonization to no colonization among exposure groups. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).",

Overall, the study characteristics reflect the rural, economically disadvantaged study population (Table 1).

Nevertheless, whether those episodes were due to viral infections was not determined in that study. Another seminal study published in 1975 indicated that acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes appeared to be associated with ARIs, and the potential role of HRV was examined. However, the study was limited by a small number of pneumococcal acquisition episodes and the lack of molecular laboratory methods; thus, no conclusive association between rhinovirus and pneumococcus was demonstrated [33].",

Although we identified several common respiratory viruses in our samples, we did not test for all respiratory viruses, such as coronavirus, that could be implicated in pneumococcal acquisitions. Second, even though the point estimates of our subgroup analyses were largely consistent with our main findings, we had a limited number of influenza infections detected during the study period, and these were largely restricted to a single respiratory season. A larger number of infections from multiple seasons would have been useful to increase the precision of some estimates. Third, NP samples were collected periodically and it was not possible to identify the exact moment of pneumococcal acquisition. Therefore, we cannot establish the precise temporal association between ARI and pneumococcal acquisition during the observation episodes. However, our study scheduled weekly visits and monthly NP collections uninformed by the presence of ARI or respiratory symptoms. Thus, any potential misclassification in the time of colonization ascertainment is likely nondifferential between acquisition and nonacquisition groups and would favor the null hypothesis. Finally, although we performed intensive surveillance through weekly household visits for detection of ARI, some studies have used more frequent home visits (eg, twice per week) attempting to minimize recall issues. We considered more frequent home visits, but the substantial increase in resources required was prohibitive. Furthermore, such an intensive strategy may have led families to opt out of the study or to modify their behaviors.",

It was postulated that by increasing respiratory secretions, acute respiratory infections could facilitate transmission and acquisition of both viruses and pneumococcus [33, 34]. Other studies that longitudinally collected nasal and nasopharyngeal samples have suggested that during the winter season or episodes of virus-induced acute respiratory disease, the nasopharynx mucous surface colonized with pneumococcus extended forward toward the nasal cavities and downward toward the trachea, facilitating colonization, transmission, and pneumococcal disease [35]. Previous studies using animal models suggested that expression of neuraminidase, an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface and that is produced by influenza, PIV, and pneumococcus, but not the other respiratory viruses tested, could be a common factor that facilitates bacterial adherence, NP pneumococcal colonization, and thus pneumococcal diseases [2\u20134, 13]. Nevertheless, pneumococcal acquisition and disease occurs even in the absence of influenza or PIV infections, and the precise mechanism for the observed synergism between influenza, PIV, and pneumococcus is unclear.",

Investigators concluded that the most likely nature of this interaction was an enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia within the first week following an influenza infection [12]. The study also acknowledged the crucial role of NP carriage and indicated that the overall impact of this interaction may be difficult to appreciate using aggregated population-level data. These findings are consistent with a previous assessment of the role of influenza on invasive pneumococcal diseases detected through laboratory-based surveillance [36]. Our study complements these previous studies by using prospectively collected individual-level data, systematic collection of respiratory samples, and laboratory-confirmed viral detection and pneumococcal colonization. Furthermore, we focused on pneumococcal acquisition, a more proximal outcome and a necessary step in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.",

There were no age differences between these children and those children who acquired pneumococcus after not being colonized, suggesting that age-related immunity (eg, passive mother-derived immunity) may not explain this observation. Facilitating acquisition of new serotypes through elimination of existing colonizing pneumococcus would not explain our findings, as elimination was similar across exposure groups. Previous experimental studies in animal models have largely focused on new pneumococcal colonization, but there is limited information on the risk of acquisition by replacing colonizing serotype(s) [2, 21, 22]. Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prevent acquisition of vaccine serotypes [37], vaccine use started during the study years in our population and was overall relatively low. This allowed us to explore the natural synergism between respiratory viruses and the pneumococcus in subgroup analysis of unvaccinated children. Finally, the risk of pneumococcal acquisition is modulated by immune and other environmental factors, including the intensity of exposure to the new pneumococcal serotype [2\u20134]. However, these factors were not measured in our study, and additional research, including other populations, is warranted to clarify this intriguing observation.",

This association seemed to be especially strong among children who were already colonized with pneumococcus. Our study findings suggest a selective synergism between certain respiratory viruses and pneumococcus. Further research into the specific mechanisms of pneumococcal interaction with influenza and PIV is warranted.
