            "text": "During celebrations of the Chinese New Year in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 caused the emergence of the newest disease, COVID-19. Initially, the trade of live animals was blamed for the transmission of the virus to many travelers, visitors, and the local population frequenting the markets (1). Subsequently, the mysterious virus initiated an epidemic that has now morphed into a pandemic (2) (3) (4) (5) . Although the biochemical interaction of the receptor-binding domain of the surface-spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in complex with the amino acid transporter B 0 AT1 has recently been resolved by cryo-EM (6), many epidemiological aspects of the virus are yet to be explored (7). The growing number of confirmed cases with the ever-expanding geographical spread of the infection has attracted much concern and Arch Med Res (8, 9) . In contrast to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is mostly spread via close contact within a community; thus, prevention measures to limit close contact are necessary to overthrow the present and potential future outbreaks. The crucial question is why the virus have rapidly crossed the borders of 114 countries within two months. The two previous outbreaks caused by SARS or MERS did not get to be classified as pandemics, but COVID-19 is apparently more contagious because of its potent spread among vulnerable targets or other individuals who may remain asymptomatic but carry and transmit the virus. In contrast to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 seems to be less fatal (35 and 10 vs. 2%, respectively). Because SAR-CoV-2 is a new infectious agent to humans, the initial exposure to it may lead to severe clinical manifestations. The above question may also be explained by the unpreparedness of the involved countries to control the outbreak. Speculating that problems in the hygiene and health-management systems may have helped the virus spread more easily seems obvious. The most referred recommendations by the health and hygiene authorities across the world so far have included frequent handwashing, wearing the protective facemasks, avoiding the suspected cases, and self-isolating at home.",

Different countries affected by the COVID-19 outbreak have responded discrepantly, but a uniform strategy is required to tackle this pandemic. Here, we propose five mandatory measures to efficiently control and tackle any present or future outbreaks of COVID-19. Second, the world needs to prepare for exceptional travel and quarantine regulations when an outbreak is first reported. Limiting international travel, customs checks, and rules on export or import of goods should be revised and renewed (18) (19) (20) . Such rules and regulations should be implemented by all the countries based on the large body of knowledge of, and experience with, the COVID-19 outbreak (21) .",

Although wearing a facemask alone does not fully protect against the spread of COVID-19, face-masking will drastically reduce the chance of successful transmission among healthy or infected cases (32). Hygiene supplies are also crucial, but we should be aware of some potential limitations of such products. For example, the prescribed use of facemasks cannot prevent the potential Arch Med Res E20_462 6 conjunctival exposure to aerosols, and a potential viral entry route through the nasolacrimal ducts or the conjunctiva itself must be considered, though a facemask may prevent the spread of aerosol-borne viral particles to wide radiuses. Smuggling the facemasks or lack of their timely distribution could negatively affect the attempts to control the outbreak. We suggest that sufficient numbers of masks should be made available to all the regions and rural areas affected by an outbreak. Ideally, everyone should be allowed to have at least one protective mask.

Undoubtedly, stopping the Huanan wholesale seafood markets in Wuhan was a favorable decision by the Chinese government.Therefore, national and international support to urgently and permanently close all similar markets throughout the mainland China and other countries is required to reduce the chance of future outbreaks. Such a measure, while drastic, could be implemented by the Chinese government or other governments over the world. However, the nonhygienic, live-animal meat markets may not remain closed forever in Wuhan. The present epidemiologic knowledge suggests that mass-gatherings-for example festivals, religious ceremonies, sporting events, conferences, and concerts-increase the risk of the person-person COVID-19 transmission while collective knowledge about the exact routes of transmission is still insufficient(4,(15)(16)(17).",
