In the past decade, M. bovis has emerged as an increasingly important cause of respiratory disease, otitis media and arthritis in young calves less than 3 months of age [1], [2], [6], [7], [9]. Clinical disease caused by M. bovis tends to be chronic, debilitating and unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Disease outbreaks with high morbidity rates occur [1], [2], [10], [15], [16] and can be economically devastating for the affected farm. The costs of infection are primarily associated with intensive treatment of affected calves coupled with culling of animals that are unresponsive to therapy [6]. M. bovis-associated disease is also important from an animal welfare perspective as it often results in calves that are subject to severe, chronic illness for which the producer or veterinarian can provide only limited relief. There is therefore a critical need to develop improved preventative and treatment strategies for M. bovis-associated disease.",

Colonization of the upper respiratory tract of calves with M. bovis often occurs within the first few weeks of life [1], [17] as a result of feeding of milk from cows infected with M. bovis or, probably, by direct or indirect transmission from other calves shedding M. bovis in nasal secretions. Removal of infected milk from the diet by pasteurization or feeding of milk replacer has been successfully applied to reduce infection [1], [15], [16], [18], [19]. Breaks in pasteurization have been associated with subsequent infection outbreaks. Management practices to reduce stocking density and improve ventilation are examples of changes that can reduce undifferentiated respiratory disease in housed calves and have been recommended for M. bovis control [20], [21], [22]. Similarly, control of other pathogens that are involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex is likely to reduce M. bovis infections. Management techniques that improve general immune function, such as improving nutritional status and minimizing environmental stress, have also been suggested as beneficial [21], [22].",

Other vaccines have been efficacious against respiratory disease [26], [27] and arthritis [26], [28], [29] in experimental challenge studies. However, in some cases vaccination against M. bovis has significantly exacerbated clinical disease [30], [31]. In addition, most experimental challenge studies have been performed in calves that are substantially older than the age at which natural colonization with M. bovis is typically first observed. Young calves are often colonized by M. bovis within the first few weeks of life [1], [2], [15], [16], [32], during which time the immune system is undergoing rapid changes associated with maturation [33], [34]. Therefore, age-specific features of the immune system are likely to be important in determining the susceptibility of the young calf to mycoplasmal disease and the efficacy of particular vaccines.",

However, no commercial vaccines are licensed for use in the very young dairy calf, and, to the best of the author's knowledge, no independent studies have been published on their efficacy. The paucity of studies that critically evaluate currently marketed M. bovis vaccines and autogenous bacterins in well-designed, independent efficacy studies in an appropriate age group is a major gap in understanding the potential of currently available vaccines as a management strategy to control M. bovis infections in young calves. In part to address this gap, we conducted a field trial using a commercial M. bovis bacterin that was approved for use in feeder and stocker calves. The objective of this field trial was to determine the efficacy of this commercially produced M. bovis bacterin for the prevention of M. bovis-associated disease (respiratory disease, otitis media, arthritis) and mortality in dairy calves up to 90 days of age. Additional objectives were to compare vaccinated and placebo-treated calves with respect to (1) weight gain from birth to 90 days of age, (2) rates of nasal colonization by M. bovis, and (3) M. bovis-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations.",

Selected calves were not necropsied when a cause of death was obvious and there had been no clinical evidence of M. bovis infection (e.g. a leg fracture that necessitated euthanasia). Calves were examined to determine the cause of death and specifically determine the involvement of M. bovis-associated pathology. Cases were defined as M. bovis-associated mortality when there had been a history of respiratory disease, otitis media, and/or arthritis, where M. bovis (with or without other pathogens) was isolated from sites of pathology, and where the observed pathology was consistent with mycoplasmal disease. All necropsies included collection of swabs of the palatine tonsils, tympanic bullae and primary bronchi for mycoplasmal culture. Additionally, if the animal had previously been diagnosed with respiratory disease, arthritis or otitis media, or if any macroscopic lung pathology was observed, appropriate samples were collected from the lesion site(s) to determine the involvement of M. bovis as well as other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Further samples were collected when deemed necessary to determine the cause of death by the veterinarian performing the necropsy. All swabs and fresh tissue samples were transported on ice to the laboratory as soon as possible and were processed within 24 h after collection. When tissue samples for fixation were collected, they were placed into containers of 10% buffered formalin and submitted to the Diagnostic Pathology Service, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida. Samples then were embedded in paraffin and sections (5 \u03bcm) stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathology was read by diagnostic pathologists without knowledge of experimental treatment groups. In addition to culture for mycoplasmas (described under nasal swabs, above), swabs for aerobic microbiological culture were processed and isolates identified using routine clinical bacteriological methods. These methods were focused on identifying bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract other than mycoplasmas, particularly Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida as well as pathogens that may cause septicemia and associated sequelae in young calves. Additional diagnostic testing was performed as requested by the veterinarian who conducted the necropsy based on the presumptive diagnosis and any macroscopic pathology.

            "text": "There are a number of key differences between the studies reported above and our study that may have influenced vaccine efficacy. Firstly, the strain of bacteria, the antigen concentration, the method of bacterial inactivation and the adjuvant used are all factors that influence the efficacy of bacterial vaccines, although there are limited data on how these affect M. bovis vaccines in particular. Although some of these data are not reported in the above studies, and some are not available for our vaccine (e.g. the adjuvant used is proprietary), it is likely that all these factors varied among our study and those listed above. Secondly, calves in the above studies were first vaccinated at a substantially older age than the calves in our study. Immune responses of the newborn calf have unique characteristics and undergo rapid changes during the first few weeks of life [33]. Vaccination at 3, 14 and 35 days of age (as was performed in our study) may not elicit the same type of immune response as vaccination at 3 weeks of age (as in the Nicholas et al. [26] study, above). Our vaccination protocol was chosen based on (a) protocols that were being applied on dairies in Florida, and (b) the early age of infection that had been observed in previous studies [1]. Thirdly, calves in endemically infected herds in our study became colonized at a very early age, meaning that infection was likely well established before a vaccine-induced immune response could develop. Adaptive immune responses that develop after infection are very inefficient at clearing mycoplasmal infections and often result in detrimental chronic inflammatory responses, and this could contribute to vaccine failure when animals are already infected at the time of vaccination. Lastly, the challenge load of M. bovis that calves are exposed to can affect the efficacy of vaccination. Given the high incidence of clinical mycoplasmal disease (60% of calves treated for M. bovis-associated disease) and the early age of colonization observed in our endemically infected herds, the level of M. bovis challenge that calves were exposed to may have been significantly greater than that of the calves in other vaccine studies [23], [26], [27].",

A tendency towards Th2-biased IgG1-dominated humoral responses has also been reported after infection of calves with M. bovis\n[39], [40]. As IgG2 is a much more effective opsonin for phagocytosis of M. bovis than is IgG1, an IgG1 response may be relatively ineffective for control of M. bovis respiratory infections [41]. It is somewhat puzzling that a humoral response to infection was not obvious in control calves in Herd B where there was a high incidence of M. bovis-associated disease. Statistical comparison of IgG1 responses in control groups in Herds A and B was not conducted. However, it appears that in the control group in Herd A, post-colostral IgG1 antibody levels continued to decline throughout the study period (see Fig. 2), whereas in the control group in Herd B, they did not decline after 7 weeks of age. This result may reflect continued stimulation of the immune response as a result of the endemic nature of M. bovis in this herd. Additionally, M. bovis infection can result in local mucosal antibody responses without eliciting a substantial systemic humoral response [27]. Other investigators have also noted a poor correlation between serum antibody responses and M. bovis infection in individual calves during the first 3 months of life [42].",

This is consistent with other reports on M. bovis vaccines; even where M. bovis vaccines have been associated with clinical benefits, they typically fail to induce an immune response that prevents upper respiratory tract infection [26], [29].

Vaccination was not efficacious in preventing M. bovis-associated disease in pre-weaned calves in two endemically infected Florida dairy herds, nor was it effective at preventing colonization of the upper respiratory tract in older calves in a third herd. The vaccine did stimulate a systemic IgG1 response that was detectable after the third vaccination, but most clinical disease occurred prior to this response. Calves in these endemically infected herds were colonized with M. bovis at a very young age, and it is likely that this represents the greatest impediment to successful vaccination in this age group. The vaccine used in this field trial was formulated for use in much older cattle (stocker and feeder calves) for the prevention of respiratory disease, and the results of this study should not be extrapolated to infer whether vaccination is efficacious in that age group. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting vaccines for use in young calves specifically to this age group, and illustrate some of the challenges to the development of an efficacious vaccine against M. bovis for use in very young calves, if vaccination of this age group is even possible.",
