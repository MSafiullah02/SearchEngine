X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 135 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and 320 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, Resnet50 was tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were an overall accuracy of 90.7% with a COVID-19 true positive rate of 0.83 and an AUC of 0.987, Pre-trained Resnet50 and VGG16 plus our own small CNN were tuned or trained on a balanced set of COVID-19 and pneumonia chest X-rays. An ensemble of the three types of CNN classifiers was applied to a test set of 33 unseen COVID-19 and 208 pneumonia cases. The overall accuracy was 94.4% with the true positive rate for COVID-19 of 0.969 with 6% false positives for a true negative rate of 0.94 and AUC of 0.99. This preliminary study has flaws, most critically a lack of information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the small data set size. More COVID-19 case images at good resolution will enable a better answer to the question of how useful chest X-rays can be for diagnosing Note an earlier version of this work inadvertently used chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia that came from a dataset of children under 5 years old and those results should be ignored.",

With testing ability limited in the US and other countries, some tests requiring significant time to produce results (days), and a projected up to 30% false positive rate, other timely approaches to diagnosis are worthy of investigation [1] . Gold standard testing currently is a RNA-based assay using nasopharyngeal swabs. The test is uncomfortable and invasive, and there are already nationwide shortages of swabs, viral transport media, and reagents needed for testing. Chest X-rays (CXR) can be used to give relatively immediate diagnostic information. X-ray machines are widely available and scans are relatively low cost and are ubiquitous in both emergency and hospital settings, where interpretation is often performed without expert radiologists. In addition, X-rays can be performed without increased risk of aerosolizing the pathogen, unlike laboratory tests that involve probing the patient's respiratory system. The X-rays may also enable the triage of patients into highest risk, high risk and lower risk of further complications, as well as to indicate the severity of disease at one or more time points. The focus of this preliminary paper is to determine whether chest X-rays may help with diagnosis of COVID-19.",

It is thought the other types of pneumonia would be most difficult to differentiate from COVID-19. Transfer learning using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has been done to see if it may be possible to diagnose COVID-19 from CXR. An issue with our data is that the stage of disease is unknown for the COVID-19 group, only that they had abnormal chest X-rays. The COVID-19 images are also mostly reduced quality jpeg. However, from our small data set it can be seen that it may be feasible to use CXR for diagnosis, especially if there are breathing issues.",

Both have 3 channels for RGB, and X-rays are grayscale, the same image scaled to the size of 224x224 was provided to each channel. For VGG there are 13 convolutional layers, each uses a small filter of size 3x3 with 1 stride and padding of 1 to extract features. Five max pooling layers with a 2x2 window and stride of 2 are used after each block of the convolutional layers. In our model, the last layers of VGG16 were removed and replaced by the trainable part which consisted of global average pooling, followed by a fully connected layer of 64 units with dropout and finally a classification layer with sigmoid output. The same procedure was followed for Resnet50. The cyclic learning rate (https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR) was used with Base learning rate= 0.0001 and Max learning rate= 0.001.

Though one does not want to reduce the true positive rate, the ratio of examples could be modified to reduce the FPR, but would require experiments that are best facilitated by more CXR data. Full resolution of CXR COVID-19 data would be most useful. Given the existing chest CT's of COVID-19 that are available, the option to create pseudo chest X-rays from them is an, albeit unusual, option for adding to our data set of COVID-19 cases.",

            "text": "Several very recent papers have also shown results with just chest X-rays for COVID-19. In [4] 1,427 CXR images were used which consisted of 224 images with confirmed COVID-19, 700 images with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images that were normal. They did transfer learning and looked at several models finding VGG19 to be the best. In a 10-fold cross validation they found true positives -TP=208, false negatives -FN=16, true negatives -TN=1189, false positives -FP=15. While it appears that some tuning may have been done in the cross validation making for slightly optimistic results, the results are positive. In [2] they developed a deep learning anomaly detection approach for screening from chest X-rays. Anomaly detection is a more challenging problem formulation, as it is one class classification. They did correctly classify 96% of 100 chest X-rays from 70 COVID-19 patients. On 1,431 CXR from 1,008 pneumonia patients they had 76.5% accuracy. So, they had quite a few more false positives than we did, yet still there is differentiation shown. In [10] transfer learning was done to identify CXRs as pneumonia or normal. They obtained 96% accuracy with a Resnet50 model on a data set of 4,273 pneumonia and 1,583 normal with 60% of the data used for training and 40% used for testing. This again suggests there is a possibility of effectively using deep learning on chest X-rays for disease detection. In [11] a Hong Kong study, it was shown chest X-ray abnormalities in COVID-19 match those seen in CT, and show bilateral peripheral consolidation. They looked at 64 CXR cases and did find a 69% sensitivity on a baseline scan, which was lower than the non-imaging test they applied (91%), Our data set only includes patients with CXR findings, and as a result our algorithm is unable to detect disease in patients who do not have human-observable CXR findings on presentation (31% as suggested by the Hong Kong study). A machine learning approach may be able to identify abnormalities in patients who have normal appearing CXR findings to a human interpreter, however, this hypothesis can only be explored after development of a dataset of CXRs from COVID-19 positive patients that also includes images that have been read as negative by an MD. Importantly, the Hong Kong study also suggests the possibility of using CXRs to identify COVID-19 positive patients with false negative laboratory tests, a significant problem facing physicians with current estimates for nasopharyngeal swabs as high as 30%, and even higher for oropharyngeal swabs.",

Hence, a next step is to build CNN type models without transfer learning. It is also possible to create transfer learning ensembles and add those into the mix of classifiers whose results will be combined.",

In a 10-fold cross validation experiment with 102 cases of COVID-19 and 102 cases of other pneumonia, overall accuracy was 96.7% with all COVID-19 cases correctly identified. Using a model built from all training data applied to 33 unseen COVID-19 cases and 208 viral and bacterial pneumonia cases the true positive rate was 96.9% with a true negative rate of 94%. Among the many limitations of this work is the small number of cases available, the lack of information on what stage of disease the chest X-rays are from, the lack of information on outcomes, the reduced resolution of the COVID-19 images and the lack of information on the types of chest X-rays most likely to be confused. Nevertheless, the current results indicate that a deep learned model applied to chest X-rays may, with more data, be of some help in diagnosing COVID-19. The collection of more COVID-19 images is the most important task towards effectively answering the question of whether chest X-rays can be a truly useful tool for fast, accurate, relatively inexpensive diagnosis of the disease. 1 ",
