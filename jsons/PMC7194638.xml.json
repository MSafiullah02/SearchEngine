All calculations were performed by Stata MP version 13.0 (Stata corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The odds ratios (ORs) was used to describe the risk of different comorbidities in severe patients compared with non-severe patients. Owing to heterogeneity within and between studies, random-effect models were used to estimate the average effect and its precision, which would give a more conservative estimate of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The I2 statistic and Cochran's Q test were used to assess statistical heterogeneity.",

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also been found that males are more likely to be infected than females (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016, Channappanavar et al., 2017). It is customary to think women are less likely to be affected by many bacteria and viruses than are men, partly because of their more robust innate and adaptive immune responses (Jaillon et al., 2019). Elderly people and severe patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which may be associated with a higher frequency of comorbidities (Zhang et al., 2020a).",

            "text": "A meta-analysis of the comorbidities suggested that hypertension was prevalent in approximately 21.1% of the patients; diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory system disease were present in 9.7%, 8.4%, and 1.5% of the cases, respectively. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus consistent with the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in China were 23.2% (Hu et al., 2019) and 10.9% (Liu et al., 2019) in adults. A recent study about influenza illness suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities, the risk of death for severe patients was higher in those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.01), and in those who had cardiovascular disease (OR 2.92, 95% CI: 1.76\u20134.86) or hypertension (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.10) (Mertz et al., 2013). The comorbidities had also been noted to have similar effects in other respiratory illnesses, such as MERS (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016). In our study, the associations were also observed in hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory system disease groups. Overall, the severe patients were older (Wang et al., 2020) and had more significant number of comorbid conditions than those who were non-severe. These results may suggest that age and comorbidities are risk factors for critical patients.",

            "text": "Diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease, and their susceptibility conditions may be linked to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Chronic diseases share several standard features with infectious disorders, such as the proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of the innate immune response. For instance, diabetes occurs in part because the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, especially IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, which promote systemic insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell damage (Odegaard and Chawla, 2012). Additionally, metabolic disorders may lead to low immune function by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function (Dooley and Chaisson, 2009), which may make individuals more susceptible to disease complications (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016). Recently, Guo et al. (2019) retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found that the absolute count levels of CD3+T cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells and CD3+CD4+ T cells in the deceased group were significantly lower than those in the survival group, suggesting that the levels of various inflammatory factors in the deceased group were higher than those in the survival group. A prospective case control study about seasonal influenza was conducted by Hong et al. (2014). Their results showed that diabetes and chronic cardiovascular disease were significantly related to development of complications, and diabetes was an independent risk factor for severe seasonal influenza (OR 3.63, 95% CI: 1.15\u201311.51, p = 0.02). Furthermore, a study analyzed the risk factors for patients with MERS-CoV infection, finding diabetes, smoking, and heart disease were also significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness (Alraddadi et al., 2016).",

The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of influenza (e. g, fever, cough or fatigue), and the COVID-19 outbreaks occured during a year of a high prevalence of respiratory diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other respiratory viruses. Vaccines can still be useful in preventing flu and will reduce possible confusion with the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Patel and Jernigan, 2020).",
