As the European Security Strategy identifies threats facing the European Union, the French White Paper on defence and national security (2008) identifies a number of threats and vulnerabilities for France and its citizens. Among these are weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and emerging health risks, and the issue of the rising number of French citizens living abroad. Other identified vulnerabilities are ballistic and missile threats, major attacks against information systems, new and robust espionage activities, major criminal networks, natural catastrophes, as well as industrial disasters and technological risks. The strategy also integrates four new security parameters: the growing interconnection between threats and risks resulting from globalization, continuity between domestic and foreign security, the possibility of sudden strategic disruptions, as well as developments impacting military operations.",

In addition, development of drug resistant strains is a public health challenge. Emerging carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are for example considered worrisome, even if few cases have been detected in France until now. The 2010 Bulletin Epid\u00e9miologique Hebdomadaire (BEH) about surveillance assessments of infectious diseases, published by InVS, also underlines the risk of introduction of chikungunya and dengue viruses by travelers arriving or returning from endemic areas, as a potential vector (a mosquito, Aedes albopictus) is now present in Southeastern France. In 2008, according to Inserm \u2013 C\u00e9piDc data, mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases represented 2% of the deaths in France.",

Even if the annual incidence is very low in France, mainly with foodborne cases, the occurrence of unusual and severe cases of botulism provides additional reasons for continuing surveillance [6]. According to 2010 InVS epidemiological data, there are also few cases of tularemia, the reporting of which became mandatory in 2002. Reporting of anthrax cases has been mandatory since 2003, but cases are extremely rare with only one imported case (2003) and three patients infected with cutaneous anthrax (2008) reported in the last decade [5]. Regarding plague, the last cases occurred in 1945. However, this disease is endemic in some areas in Africa and Asia that have close links to France. As for viral hemorrhagic fevers, most cases in metropolitan France are caused by Puumala virus (Hantavirus), responsible for a relatively mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptoms, and yellow fever (Arbovirus) for which vaccination is mandatory to travel to French Guiana. No case of African hemorrhagic fever has been identified in France since the inclusion of these diseases on the mandatory reporting list, however, the risk of importation must not be ignored.",

Proceeding to post-crisis assessments and sharing experiences, in order to enhance existing plans and procedures, is a crucial aim. The French plan against bioterrorism pre-dated the 2001 anthrax attacks, but these events, followed by numerous hoaxes, contributed to raise awareness and prompted a reassessment of existing measures. SARS outbreaks and influenza pandemic threats have also led to improvements in terms of biopreparedness.",

In this perspective, one objective of the strategy developed in the pandemic influenza plan is indeed to organize and ensure continuity of Government action as well as of social and economic life. It is of importance to continue to adopt and adapt efficient institutional and business continuity plans to be able to face a public health crisis, and though there is a focus on critical infrastructure operators, all enterprises are encouraged to do so. But the key challenge remains to raise and maintain awareness not only of first-responders and operators but also of French citizens, as they are also key players, the reactions of whom may have a direct impact on the development and management of a crisis and its consequences.",
