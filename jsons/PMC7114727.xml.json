In some cases, there may be a history of vaccination compliance, yet some animals develop disease [25], [26]. It is important to record the complete history, including the body system involved (eg, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive tract, nervous system), clinical symptoms and their duration, the presence of lesions, and vaccination history. Particularly when the case is confounding, the client must be carefully and thoroughly interviewed as to how he or she manages the pet (ie, is the pet free to roam; has the pet traveled recently and where; if this is a new pet, where and how was it obtained; are there other pets in the household). Consulting a book on differential diagnoses can be useful to list the potential causes [27], [28]. When a history of unusual symptoms is presented, clinicians, recognizing that these cases may be important to individual and universal animal health, should refer these cases to an accredited veterinary diagnostic laboratory. It is convenient to attach copies of all relevant hospital records to the laboratory submission form to aid the diagnostician. Correct diagnosis depends on a thorough case history of the affected animal and submission of appropriate specimens that are collected and transported in a manner to preserve the integrity of the viral agent.",

All the system(s) that are potentially involved and all the tissues with gross lesions should be sent to the diagnostic laboratory. It is important to check for concurrent infections. Viral diagnosis depends on the quality and type of specimen collected [29]. The best time for collection of specimens is immediately after symptoms of disease are first noticed. Samples from all body systems involved in the acute stage of the disease of affected animals should be submitted to the diagnostic laboratory in a timely manner by overnight delivery. At least 1 to 5 g or mL of each sample should be collected. Recovery of virus in cell culture depends on the condition of the specimen received by the diagnostic laboratory. Freezing specimens can be detrimental to virus isolation efforts (and also to electron microscopic identification) and should only be done (\u221270\u00b0C) if it is not possible to deliver the specimen to the laboratory within 48 hours. Use wet ice for shipping virology samples, because dry ice (solid carbon dioxide gas) can inactivate many viruses, preventing isolation in cell culture. Tissues intended for virus isolation should always be shipped in separate packages from specimens that are immersed in formalin to prevent fumes of formaldehyde from reaching the fresh tissues.",

            "text": "Histologic (\nFig. 2) and cytologic examination (\nFig. 3) of tissues and fluids by a board-certified veterinary pathologist contributes valuable information about the pathologic signs, gross and microscopic, that distinguish infections caused by viral or bacterial pathogens and other possible etiologies. Tissue tropism, mononuclear infiltrates, development of inclusion bodies (intranuclear, cytoplasmic, or both), and the formation of syncytia are some of the characteristics that differ among viruses and can sometimes distinguish different viral infections. For example, most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, and thus tend to produce intranuclear inclusions, whereas most RNA viruses form cytoplasmic inclusions, although there are exceptions. As part of the pathologist's examination, immunohistochemistry testing (\nFig. 4, Fig. 5), fluorescent antibody testing, and possibly in situ hybridization (ISH) studies on tissues may be ordered; these methods are considered elsewhere in this article. A complete histopathology report should include possible differentials for the lesions. The pathologist might note that some findings do not exactly fit the routine lesions he or she has observed in previously. In cases in which there are deviations in lesion type or distribution or when gross lesions and histopathologic findings suggest the involvement of a viral disease but routine virology tests do not detect the expected conventional viral agents, variant or \u201cemerging\u201d viruses or even iatrogenic infections may be suspected. In early 1990, blue tongue virus serotype 11 was introduced in canine populations from a commercial modified-live multivalent canine vaccine that was associated with high mortality in dogs [31], [32]. In some situations, second or even third opinions from pathologists at other laboratories who have special expertise should be solicited [33]. With the application of telepathology to veterinary case materials, networks of specialists, including veterinary pathologists, small animal clinicians, infectious disease specialists, and laboratory diagnosticians, are able to exchange patient histories, clinical data, and images (gross and microscopic) through the Internet for consultation, diagnosis, and education. This allows timely access to expert opinions at other locations throughout the world [34], [35]. The use of telepathology can facilitate rapid intervention through the synergy of computer technology and special pathology expertise (eg, system- and species-specific pathologic findings) to understand the lesions in difficult cases better.",

Virus isolation may be relatively slow depending on the growth characteristics of the virus; however, roller culturing or centrifugation of samples onto cell monolayer(s) can enhance viral replication and recovery. In many of the recent emerging viruses from wildlife (eg, bats), the virus was first cultivated, allowing further characterization of the virus. It is important to keep in mind that virus isolation, even if the effort is successful, may have a slow turn-around time, approximately 2 to 3 weeks. Definitive identification of virus in cell culture can only be accomplished with specific antibody nucleic acid testing, and in the case of an \u201cemerging\u201d virus, existing reagents may not be reactive with the \u201cnew\u201d virus. If culture is successful, however, the viral material may be studied by electron microscopy (EM) and by molecular techniques, as described in this article, to characterize the new isolate. Virus isolation requires fresh tissues and cannot be done on formalin-fixed tissues.",

Additionally, EM is indispensable for identification of emerging and previously unidentified viruses in clinical samples [36], and this method has helped in the identification of many new viruses, including, most recently, bat Lyssavirus [37]. Viruses can be classified up to the virus family based on size, shape, and distinctive structural features, such as envelopes or protein spikes, particularly for parvovirus, rotavirus (\nFig. 6), coronavirus, astrovirus, herpesvirus, poxvirus, and picornavirus. EM allows detection of multiple viruses simultaneously. Application of antibodies to supplement the EM diagnosis provides higher sensitivity and further confirmation of the viral diagnosis. Sensitivity is the major limitation of EM, and at least 105 to 107 virus particles per milliliter must be present in the sample being examined. Because the electron microscope is an expensive piece of equipment that requires special technical skills and a high level of expertise, it is not available in many laboratories.

Nuclease susceptibility of the purified virions differentiates DNA from RNA. The presence of envelope on viruses can be determined by susceptibility to the virus to heat, ether, or other lipid solvents [39]. The titrated virus preparation is treated with ether or chloroform. A decrease in virus titer of greater than 1 log is considered to be significant to indicate the presence of envelope on the virus.

Serologic methods still provide powerful tools in the virology laboratory of today for diagnosing viral diseases that are seen routinely and for discovering and characterizing novel viral diseases. Serologic tests are now used to detect antibody or antigen in serum and body fluids. Typically, methods used in the virology laboratory are serum neutralization (SN), hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and ELISA. Serologic results require interpretation by an expert diagnostician based on critical clinical observations, confirmation by pathology examination, virus isolation, and mass screening of the populations by serology. If animals in populations that have never been exposed to or vaccinated against a given virus have specific antibodies detected in their serum, it is expected that this is most likely attributable to recent exposure to the emerging virus. Paired serum samples are important to demonstrate a fourfold significant increase in antibody titers, which indicates that the diagnosis of recent exposure may be attributable to infection as opposed to previous exposure or vaccination depending on the vaccination history. Serology is also useful to study the antigenic distance of the emerging virus and provides clues as to whether the newly emerged agent is or is not likely to be protected by an available vaccine(s), such as heterologous virus in another species of animal.",

This phenomenon is the basis for a powerful and sensitive assay, the HAI test.

The SN test can diagnose current infection using acute and convalescent serum samples from individual animals. It may also be used to determine immune status conferred on vaccinated animals. Vaccination antibody titers often differ from antibody titers developed in response to natural infection. Usually, vaccination titers are lower relative to infection titers, and maximal titers occur approximately 21 to 30 days after vaccination. SN assays are commonly performed to detect antibodies to FCV, herpesvirus, enteric coronavirus, and syncytial viruses and to canine herpesvirus, CDV, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus.",

The ELISA format is flexible, and it may be used to detect antibody or antigen in clinical specimens. In either case, the detection system is an antibody conjugated to an enzyme. When the enzyme-linked antibody binds to the analyte being measured, the enzyme reacts with a chromogenic substrate, causing a color change to occur that may be measured spectrophotometrically or evaluated visually. Several ELISA kits are available to detect antiviral antibodies in companion animals, including CPV and CDV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline coronavirus. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) ELISA is a method used to distinguish current infection from past infection. During acute disease or immediately after vaccination with modified-live viruses, IgM is the first class of immunoglobulin produced in response to infection, appearing 1 to 2 weeks before there are detectable levels of IgG in the serum. Because it is short-lived, IgM levels typically disappear 3 months after infection. A single acute-phase serum test sample is sufficient to diagnose current infection with an IgM ELISA. Testing of IgM titers is available for several viral agents, including CDV and CPV among others. ELISA is useful for screening naive animal populations for the presence of antibodies against viruses to track the origin and spread of emerging infections. Antibodies to WNV have recently been detected in dogs and cats by IgM-capture ELISA [42]. A related method known as virus neutralization can be used to identify the serotype of a newly discovered virus.",

To perform the assay, purified virus is disrupted using detergent; the constituent proteins are then separated on the basis of molecular weight by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel. The proteins are transferred (blotted) from the gel to a nitrocellulose or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane for stabilization. The electrophoretically separated proteins are the antigen substrates for analyzing the test sera for the presence of specific antibodies. As with the ELISA format, the Western immunoblot uses an enzyme-labeled antispecies antibody that binds to the test serum antibodies that have bound to the separated viral antigens. Substrate reacting with the enzyme-labeled antibody in the presence of a colorless soluble benzidine derivative results in conversion to colored insoluble precipitate at the protein bands where test serum antibodies are bound. The molecular weight of the protein detected is characteristic for a particular viral component. Immunoblot results of the unknown test antisera are compared with positive control test sera for interpretation. A major advantage of the immunoblot technique is that a full antibody profile of a single serum sample is made simultaneously, identifying each of the individual particulate viral antigens that patient antibodies bind. As an epidemiologic tool, WB analysis may be used to detect currently circulating viral subtypes within a population and to characterize new emerging viral subtypes. Immunoblotting is also a valuable research technique for antigen detection that is often used to characterize novel viruses by comparing them with known related viral family members using standard antisera or monoclonal antibodies.",

Although this variation on PCR and nucleic acid sequencing is currently used exclusively as a research tool, it is likely to be adapted for clinical diagnostic work in future years because it has been demonstrated to detect many different unrelated viruses simultaneously in a single reaction and to identify viral serotypes and detect viral isolates that could not previously be typed by classic procedures [52], [53].",

Microarrays are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds or thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions that are most commonly detected through the use of fluorophores. The fluorescent signal patterns formed by each analyte are then compared by the computer software using complex algorithms to make an identification of its contents. Biochips enable researchers to screen large numbers of biologic analytes quickly for a variety of purposes, ranging from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents. Biochip technology is still relatively new and has not yet entered the mainstream of clinical diagnostics techniques, although it is widely used in research institutions. As an epidemiologic tool, the use of nucleic acid microarrays was instrumental in the rapid identification of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in China [54]. Coronavirus protein microarrays have been used to screen Canadian sera [55] for specific antibodies to SARS and to other coronaviruses in a comparative study with the traditional ELISA. Scientists around the world are assessing the feasibility of using microarrays as tools for surveillance and diagnosis of influenza viruses [56], [57].

Because of changes in the sequence of the target protein epitopes, antibody-based detection methods may fail to provide the diagnosis; monoclonal antibodies used may fail to react and polyclonal antibodies may cross-react weakly when a variant strain of virus is present. Thus, a sudden trend in lack of correlation between tests may signal an emerging variant of the virus. If a new variant of the virus arises, it may be associated with a change in the clinical profile and we may or may not understand the molecular basis of this shift. It is possible that the polyclonal antibodies may react weakly with the new variant of the virus. In many cases, the PCR primers may fail to amplify the new variant if the mutation occurs in the hypervariable region of the target gene amplified. For example, in the recent emergence of CPV variants, many practitioners noted clinical symptoms compatible with CPV but the commercial field tests were not working. If a new variant of virus emerges, a polyclonal antibody antiserum prepared in a heterologous species (rabbit or goat) can be used as a primary antibody against the whole virus, because it is possible that the monoclonal antibody might fail. The molecular techniques are more likely to fail compared with the antibody-based techniques because of the degeneracy of codons. It is important to keep in mind that factors other than emerging viruses can also affect the performance of USDA-approved tests. For example, local anesthetic can also affect the outcome of antibody tests. In one study, the use of lidocaine was recommended over oxybuprocaine to avoid false-positive results [59].",
