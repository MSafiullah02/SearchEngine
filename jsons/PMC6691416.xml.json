We could not find previously reported measures of agreement to compare with the agreement values of MGRAT found in this study.

Therefore, Wynd et al., propose that both CVI and multi-rater kappa statistic should be calculated in the content validity studies because unlike the CVI, kappa adjusts for chance agreement.[12] The chance agreement is an issue of concern while studying agreement indices among assessors, especially when we place four-point scoring within two \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201cnot relevant\u201d classes. In other words, kappa statistic is a consensus index of inter-rater agreement that adjusts for chance agreement and is an important supplement to CVI because Kappa provides information about the degree of agreement beyond chance. Nevertheless, the CVI is mostly used by researchers because it is simple for calculation, easy to understand, and provide information about each item, which can be used for modification or deletion of instrument items.[1012]",

As per the interpretation of Fleiss\u2019 kappa (\u03ba) (from Landis and Koch 1977), 0.522 indicates moderate agreement. Overall, CVI and Fleiss\u2019 kappa (\u03ba) both the measures suggest that the content validity of the newly developed tool is appropriate. MGRAT was judged to be valid, appropriate, and feasible to assess the health risks associated with the MG events.",
