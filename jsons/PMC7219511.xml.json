Despite the many advances made in the study of critical phenomena [4] on random networks, their analysis in the presence of a geometric embedding has remained an important theoretical challenge, so far grounded on very little analytical results [5\u20139]. This represents today a fundamental barrier in the understanding of complex systems of great interest, like networks of neurons [10,11], communication [12] and transportation systems [13], or power-grids [14], whose functioning strongly intertwines their spatial constraints.",

Although simplistic, the exponential wiring cost function of this model correctly fits the spatial distribution of link lengths observed in communication systems [16], like the Internet [17,18] or transport networks [19,20], interactions based on similarity in social networks [21], and recent experimental results [22\u201326] support the existence of scale-invariant organizational principles in the connectome of mammals based on it.",

Depending on the values of \u03b6, in fact, our model crosses over between two limiting regimes: for \u03b6\u223cO(L), all link lengths are equally probable (i.e., \ud835\udcabij\u223c\u03ba) and we recover a random, ER-like structure, whilst for \u03b6\u223cO(1/\u03c1) (where \u03c1 is the average density of nodes), long links are prohibited, leading instead to a latticelike topology. By performing site percolation [29\u201331], we disclose an intriguing scenario: while far from criticality the random part of the giant component crosses over to a spatial regime at the characteristic scale \u03b6, close to the percolation threshold it surprisingly extends in space until the intrinsic scale \u03be*(\u03b6)=\u03b66/(6-d), for d<6. We call this structural expansion of mean-field regimes the critical stretching, and we explore its universal features by means of scaling arguments, and simulations in d=2. In particular, because the structure affects the collective phenomena occurring on it, the critical stretching should be reflected in processes evolving on this spatial network. We verify this claim on an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) process [32], where the mean-field (diffusive) regime of the outbreak front\u2019s velocity undergoes a temporal critical stretching, making the epidemic invade the system at \u201cslow\u201d rates for significantly longer times.",

For increasing \u03b6, a rapid monotonic decrease of the percolation threshold pc from the lattice value to the ER one pcMF=1/\u27e8k\u27e9 is observed [Fig. 1(b), and Ref. [20] ]. To analyze the response the scaling of percolation observables have to this variation, we consider the correlation length \u03be2(p)\u2254\u222br2g(r,p)dr/\u222bg(r,p)dr, where g(r,p) is the pair connectivity function for a given occupation probability p. By definition, \u03be measures the mean distance between sites belonging to the same cluster, and it diverges as p approaches pc like \u03be\u223c|p-pc|-\u03bdd. Numerical results [Fig. 1(a)] for networks in d=2, display excellent agreement with the critical exponents expected in the two limiting cases, i.e., \u03bd2D=4/3 for \u03b6\u223cO(1) and \u03bdMF=1/2 for \u03b6\u223cO(L), further showing that a crossover from the former to the latter regime occurs closer and closer to pc for increasing \u03b6.",

            "text": "This critical crossover can be understood by invoking the Levanyuk-Ginzburg (LG) criterion [34]. Since the spectrum of our spatial network satisfies the classical LG assumptions [6], we expect fluctuations to be negligible as long as u3-d/2\u03b6d\u226b1 for d<6, where u\u2261|p/pc-1| is the displacement of p from its critical value. To obtain this condition, we noticed that the scale up to which the mean-field regime extends in the giant cluster is \u03beMF\u221d\u03b6\u03be\u21131/2, where \u03be\u2113(u)\u223cu-1 is the (dimensionless) correlation length in chemical space, and the factor \u03b6 takes into account the characteristic length of links [35]. The critical crossover should then take place at u*(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b6-2d/(6-d) and, in light of the above, at the intrinsic scale \u03be*(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b66/(6-d). For such variation to occur, the amplitude modulating the scaling of \u03be with u must itself become anomalous in \u03b6 as soon as fluctuations set in, so that \u03bed\u221d\u03b6\u03a8(d)u-\u03bdd. The exponent \u03a8(d) can be found by invoking a smooth variation at u*, i.e., \u03beMF|u*=\u03bed|u*, yielding \u03a8(d)=[(6-2d\u03bdd)/(6-d)]. Factoring out \u03be*, as well as u/u*, we obtain the generalized scaling \u03be(u,\u03b6)\u03be*(\u03b6)=(uu*(\u03b6))-\u00bdF(uu*(\u03b6)),(1)where F(x)\u221dx-\u03bdd+1/2 for x\u226a1, and constant otherwise. After specializing these results to the case d=2, the data presented in Fig. 1(a) have been accordingly rescaled. The data collapse depicted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) supports our scaling arguments, and further highlights an interesting prediction of the LG criterion. Although one would have expected the random-to-spatial crossover to occur at the input characteristic scale \u03b6\u2014as it does far from criticality\u2014here it stretches until \u03b66/(6-d). This scale can be regarded as the network analogue at the crossover of what Binder calls \u201cthermodynamic length\u201d in spin systems [27]. However, in contrast to thermal phase transitions, \u03be* identifies here a \u201cstructural length\u201d at which geometric fluctuations set in. This means that \u03be* does not only rule the critical scaling of the percolation observables, but also the network\u2019s geometry at the onset of the giant component, stretching nonlinearly with \u03b6 its mean-field regimes. For this reason, we call this phenomenon critical stretching and in what follows we characterize its geometric and dynamic properties.",

(1) implies a nontrivial structural variation of the large-scale organization of the network close to its percolation threshold. To put this on firmer bases, consider the scaling of the pair connectivity function g(r,u,\u03b6)\u221dr-d+2-\u03b7e-r/\u03be(u,\u03b6), where \u03b7 is the anomalous dimension. The correlation length \u03be(u,\u03b6) is itself the representative of a crossover in the giant component, separating a self-similar organization where g(r)\u223cr-d+2-\u03b7, from a \u201cnoncritical\u201d one marked instead by a decreasing exponential [31]. Then again, we know from Eq. (1) that \u03be(u,\u03b6) crosses over between the mean-field and the lattice singular behaviors, depending on how close the network is to pc. Let us then fix the occupation probability to a value u\u226au*, so that geometric fluctuations are free to set in above \u03be*. In turn, this means that \u03be|u\u226au*\u226b\u03be* and so the cutoff e-r/\u03be(u,\u03b6) becomes significant only if r\u223cO(\u03be*). Therefore, reading gu(r,\u03b6) as a function of r for fixed u\u226au* and variable values of \u03b6, we advance the crossover relation gu(r,\u03b6)g*(\u03b6)=(r\u03be*(\u03b6))-4G(r\u03be*(\u03b6),\u03be|u\u226au*\u03be*(\u03b6)),(2)where g*(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b6-24/(6-d), and G(x,y)\u221dx\u03a6(d)e-x/y for x\u226b1 and constant otherwise, with y\u226b1 and \u03a6(d)=6-d-\u03b7. To obtain Eq. (2), we have rescaled the argument of the exponential cutoff to make explicit the ratio r/\u03be*, and factorized out the mean-field regime gMF\u223cr-4.",

            "text": "Equation (2) provides a geometric formulation of the LG criterion at criticality, upon which density fluctuations of the spanning cluster are negligible as far as r\u226a\u03b66/(6-d). This result enables testing the critical stretching of the high-dimensional (mean-field) regime of the networks\u2019 structure by comparing its geometric features at and away from criticality. With this aim, we focus on two exponents: (i) the shortest-path fractal dimension dmin, and (ii) the mass fractal dimension df of the incipient cluster [30]. Although the analysis could be carried out in any dimension d<6, we restrict here to the case d=2 for simplicity of computation. Let us start from the behavior at p=pc. (i) By definition, dmin regulates the scaling of the mean Euclidean distance \u27e8r\u27e9 between sites in the giant cluster separated by the chemical distance \u2113, so that \u2113\u223c\u27e8r\u27e9dmin for \u27e8r\u27e9 large enough. For future reference, we consider the reciprocal scaling \u27e8r\u27e9\u223c\u21131/dmin, for \u2113 large enough. In chemical space, \u03be* translates [35] into the quantity \u03be\u2113*\u2261\u230au*-1\u230b=\u230a\u03b6\u230b (where the brackets denote the floor function) which, consistently with the scaling ansatz in Eq. (2), identifies the intrinsic chemical length at which the geometric crossover occurs. In defining dmin, we must thus consider two regimes: \u2113\u226a\u03be\u2113* where dminMF=2 (i.e., random walk), and \u2113\u226b\u03be\u2113* where instead dmin2D\u22431.13077(2)\n[36]. Merging the two behaviors into a single equation, we propose the scaling \u27e8r\u27e9(\u2113,\u03b6)\u03be*(\u03b6)=(\u2113\u03be\u2113*(\u03b6))\u00bdR(\u2113\u03be\u2113*(\u03b6)),(3)where R(x)\u221dx1/dmin2D-1/2 for x\u226b1 and constant otherwise. We tested Eq. (3) by using a breadth-first search algorithm whose results, displayed in Fig. 2(a), support our scaling arguments. (ii) To investigate the mass scaling M\u223crdf at pc, we first need to determine the dependence on \u03b6 of the giant cluster\u2019s amplitude. This quantity is found by calculating the \u03b6 correction to the size S\u221e of the giant component in the spatial regime which, according to the LG criterion, scales as S\u221e2D\u221d\u212c(\u03b6)u5/36 with \u212c(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b6-31/36. In light of this, we obtain the scaling M2D\u221d\u212c(\u03b6)r91/48 for r\u226b\u03be* which, combined with what expected in the high-dimensional (mean-field) part, i.e., MMF\u223cr4\n[30], yields the ansatz M(r,\u03b6)M*(\u03b6)=(r\u03be*(\u03b6))4M(r\u03be*(\u03b6)),(4)where M(x)\u221dx-101/48 for x\u226b1, constant otherwise, and M*(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b6571/288 is the incipient cluster\u2019s mass at \u03be*. Equation (4) states in more practical terms the prediction of Eq. (2), namely that the fractal geometry of the critical cluster in our network crosses over from the one of an ER graph [37] (i.e., dfMF=4) to that of a d=2 lattice (for which df2D=91/48), where the former stretches up until the intrinsic length \u03b63/2. As shown in Fig. 2(b), Eq. (4) exquisitely matches the numerical data.",

Let us start from the mass scaling (ii) at p=1. In this case, the Euclidean dimension d=2 is expected to regulate the scaling of M for distances r\u223cO(\u03be\u00d7), while an infinite-dimensional (small-world) behavior should be observed for r\u223co(\u03be\u00d7). The numerical results in Fig. 2(c) corroborate this intuition, further showing [Fig. 2(c), inset] that below \u03be\u00d7 the random structure embeds onto an Euclidean space whose dimension grows unbounded with \u03b6. (i) The shortest-path\u2019s scaling at p=1 supports this large-to small-world crossover: while for r\u2272\u03be\u00d7\nany path shall behave like a random walk [30], i.e., \u27e8r\u27e9\u221d\u03b6\u21131/2, for \u27e8r\u27e9\u2273\u03be\u00d7 (lattice regime) the lengths \u2113 and \u27e8r\u27e9 must share the same metric, i.e., \u27e8r\u27e9\u223c\u2113. We can then advance the scaling \u27e8r\u27e9=\u03b6\u21131/2f(\u2113) where f(\u2113)\u221d\u21131/2 for \u2113\u2273\u03be\u2113\u00d7(\u03b6) and constant otherwise. The quantity \u03be\u2113\u00d7 can be regarded as the chemical length up to which the small-world extends, so \u03be\u2113\u00d7\u221dlogN\u03b6\u223clog\u03b6 since N\u03b6\u223c\u03b62. The data collapse in Fig. 2(d) is consistent with our scaling, and further supports [Fig. 2(d), inset] the approximation \u03be\u2113\u00d7\u221dlog\u03b6. Altogether, these results confirm the prediction that far from criticality the network\u2019s geometry is governed by the characteristic scale \u03b6, corroborating the surprising effect of the critical stretching.",

            "text": "Stretching effects in spreading dynamics.\u2014Since collective phenomena are strongly affected by the geometry of the underlying interaction structure, the critical stretching will accordingly influence the dynamics of processes acting on the network. As an illustrative example, let us consider an SIR process with infection rate \u03b2 and recovery time \u03b3\u22611, spreading on our network model in d=2. In light of the mapping to percolation [32], the clusters of nodes removed by the outbreak are geometrically equivalent to those originated from a static deletion, whereas the shortest-path \u2113 identifies now the number of time steps t separating infected nodes in the \u2113th shell from an initial spreader. Setting the relative rate \u03b2\u2032\u22611-\u03b2/\u03b2c to a value \u03b2\u2032\u226a\u03b6-1, we thus expect the spreading of the disease to undergo a temporal crossover at the intrinsic time scale \u03c4*\u2261\u230a\u03b6\u230b from a mean-field behavior to a spatial one. In particular, interpreting \u27e8r\u27e9 as the average distance of the infective nodes from an initial spreader, we can deduce from Eq. (3) that the spreading velocity v\u2254d\u27e8r\u27e9/dt\u223ct1/dmin-1 of the outbreak front will accordingly satisfy the temporal scaling v(t,\u03b6)v*(\u03b6)=(t\u03c4*(\u03b6))-\u00bdV(t\u03c4*(\u03b6)),(5)where V(x)\u221dx1/dmin2D-1/2 for x\u226b1, constant otherwise, and v*(\u03b6)\u2261\u03b61/2 is the crossover critical velocity. The data collapse in Fig. 3 validates our premises, confirming that, if critical, the epidemic front undergoes a spatiotemporal crossover at the distances (\u03be*,\u03c4*) from the infective spreader, varying from diffusive to superdiffusive propagations. Since the crossover time scale stretches from a logarithmic\u2014\u03c4\u00d7\u221dlog\u03b6 far from criticality\u2014to a linear dependence with \u03b6, we disclose an intriguing scenario: if critical, an outbreak will invade the system at \u201cslow\u201d (i.e., diffusive) rates for longer times, before turning superdiffusive. Besides of theoretical interest, these results are relevant for the analysis of spreading processes in real-world systems, e.g., in virus propagation on wireless networks [16], in the spreading of diseases through transportation systems [19,20] or of rumors in social networks [21], whose spatial constraints are well captured by the exponential wiring cost function here adopted.",

We found that while this crossover occurs at \u03b6 when p=1, it surprisingly extends until \u03b66/(6-d) close to pc, signaling that the mean-field (ER) structure expands beyond the input characteristic link length \u03b6 near criticality.

(i) The critical stretching length scales \u03be* and \u03be\u2113* are univocally defined by the critical exponents of percolation and the dimension of the embedding space. As such, they are not influenced by the system\u2019s finite size [35] and can be regarded as a set of universal spatiotemporal scales for any spatial network featuring a characteristic scale of link lengths and a homogeneous degree distribution. (ii) In light of the expressions in Table I, the stretching effects become stronger at higher embedding dimensions. In d=3 networks, e.g., the intrinsic scales \u03be*=\u03be\u2113*=\u03b62 at pc are significantly larger if compared to the crossover scales \u03be\u00d7=\u03b6 and \u03be\u2113\u00d7\u221dlog\u03b6 away from criticality. This supports the possibility that the stretching effects we found can be experimentally observed in real-world systems. In fact, besides accurately modeling communication [16\u201318,21] and transport networks [19,20], recent evidences [23\u201326] support the existence of scale-invariant organization principles in mammal brains based on the exponential wiring cost function examined here. Our results offer then a fundamental keystone for understanding, e.g., the traffic flow [13] or the neural functioning\u2014e.g., in reference to the observed activity before epileptic seizures [38]\u2014and they raise the perspective of developing criteria (say, measuring the amount of stretching in the propagation of the action potentials for neural networks) for testing how close these systems are to their tipping points.",
