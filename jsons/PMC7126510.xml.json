This system consisted of two sites: a referring physician site and an expert center, for point-to-point teleradiology service mode [5]. Both sites could display all the DICOM images and could remotely synchronize image manipulation during consultation using remote dual cursors. This system allowed real-time collaborative consultation of serious or difficult cases with high resolution and large volume medical images in a limited bandwidth network environment. The system relied both on standardized technologies, such as DICOM and TCP/IP network protocols, and on innovative techniques such the advanced message routing concept for remote control functionality. Also the dual cursors of the system could synchronize their operation and image processing results to make both participants feel no distance barrier and no misunderstanding between them during image study. Fig. 1\nshows the basic architecture of this real-time interactive teleconsultation system.",

Secondly, the consultation operation mode was point-to-point, it would make collaborative application more complicated if third party was interested in or invited into the collaborative applications. This was because the system had to re-send images to a third party. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we design and develop a new web-based system to provide electronic patient records (EPR) collaboration with several new functionalities including a central operation mode for intranet and internet healthcare providers.",

Currently, there are two typical application architectures used in networked information systems: two tiers client/server (C/S) architecture and three tiers browser/servers (B/S) architecture. In order to avoid the drawback of the point-to-point, we designed the EPR collaborative system by using the combination of the C/S and B/S architectures, as shown in Fig. 2\n. The EPR data acquisition from the HIS/PACS/CIS to EPR gateway and the data transmission from the EPR gateway to EPR server adopt C/S architecture. The EPR data delivery from the EPR server to EPR Viewers uses the B/S architecture. The EPR data acquired from the HIS, PACS or CIS first have to pass to the EPR gateway to check their patient and study headers information to make sure the medical records of same patient linked together to provide patient-oriented applications. Then, the EPR data are sent to EPR server. Most medical records are in DICOM formats such as images, graphics, curves and RT records, but the text-based records are in XML (The Extensible Markup Language) format. The collaboration operation on the EPR data between any two web users is follows the central mode which means that all the consulted medical records would be sent to, managed and retrieved from the central EPR server. In Section 4, we will present the work and data flows of this web-based collaborative consultation system to explain how it works.",

In order to manage other complex medical objects such as used in oncology treatment procedures, the information model also has the extension for radiation therapy (RT) objects defined by DICOM Standard.

We also introduced the remote control module, developed in our previous interactive teleradiology system [5], into the display and processing component to enable this new component have collaborative operation functions with the EPR objects, such as using dual cursors to perform image manipulation and processing functions of window/level, zoom, overlay, orientation, and measurements. The remote control module sends and receives operation messages generated from local and remote sites, and dispatches the messages to multi-media display modules to synchronize their operations on the EPR objects. We integrate this new component into a Web browser to create web-based EPR Viewer, as we did it in our web-based PACS image distribution [9]. This allows users to use dual cursors, provided by the EPR viewer, to synchronize their operations to understand each other on studied cases. The communication relation between the web viewer and the web server is same with our web PACS [9].",

First, the medical image, records or objects are sent to the EPR Repository Server from the client 1 through DICOM or TCP/IP protocol by using EPR gateway. Later on, client 2 or 3 can get the EPR data through http protocol from the web server and manipulate the data interactively with client 1, or between them by using the message routing and controlling function through the remote control module integrated in multi-media display and processing component. So, the collaborative operation procedures of the central mode are much simpler and easier comparing to the point-to-point mode.

During the winter of 2002 through the spring of 2003, World Health Organization received reports of >8000 SARS cases and nearly 800 deaths. The main way that SARS seemed to spread is by close person-to-person contact. The virus that caused SARS was thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughed or sneezed. Most of the SARS cases in China occurred by infection in hospitals or among travelers. To protect the physicians, experts and nurses from the SARS during the diagnosis and treatment procedures, the infection control mechanisms were built in SARS hospitals in China, e.g. medical workers in SARS control area could not contact outside people and even medical records could not bring out the control area. Usually, there were three areas in the SARS hospital: the infection area, in which SRAS patients were stayed and taken cared by clinical SARS physicians; non-infection area, in which the radiologists and other experts of the hospital worked to support the SARS diagnosis and treatment happened in the infection area; and the data center where the HIS, PACS, CIS located. Also, there was an off-site SARS expert center out side the SARS hospital, where the other hospital experts can provide teleconsultation services to help the SARS hospital on SARS diagnosis and treatments. In order to make radiologists, physicians and experts both inside and out side control area collaborate efficiently on SARS image diagnosis without concerning the infection, we installed the web-based EPR system in a SARS hospital and an off-site expert center in Shanghai to provide tele-consultation for SARS diagnosis.",

There were three Web EPR viewers or clients installed in these two hospitals: two were located in the infection area and non-infection area of the Infection Hospital, and the third one was located in Xinhua Hospital, as shown in Fig. 8\n. With the Web architecture and the intranet and Internet connections of the system to different clients located in side and out side hospitals, the real-time teleconsultation with interactive EPR manipulation could take place between any two sites of the infection area, non-infection areas, and off-site expert center.",

We used a laser digitizer (Array, 2905, Japan) to digitize these film images and sent the digitized film images together with direct digital images to the web-based PACS for archiving. Fig. 9\nshows the digitized film images of a SARS patient in the infection area of the Shanghai Infection Hospital. Most film sizes were 14\u00d717 in., and the image formats of digitized films were DICOM about 3560\u00d74320\u00d72 b (the grayscale was 12 bits).

We used two WANs for image transmission, one was ATM network built by Shanghai local healthcare organization, and the other was ADSL owned by Shanghai Telecommunication Corp. The bandwidth of the ATM site to site was about 10 Mb/s. For the ADSL, the downloading bandwidth was 2 Mb, and uploading was 1 Mb/s. There were two consultation meetings held for SARS diagnosis between the Shanghai Infection Hospital and Xinhua Hospital during May 2003. The first consultation meeting was held using ADSL WAN, the image transmission time for one case took about one hour and more. The second consultation meeting was held using ATM WAN. The time required to transfer one case was less than 15 min. Table 1, Table 2\ngive the transmission results of the digitized film images from Shanghai Infection Hospital to Shanghai Xinhua Hospital by using ADSL and ATM, respectively. The other medical records of SARS patients acquired from the HIS were sent to the EPR repository before the image transmission.
