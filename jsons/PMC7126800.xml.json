In 2005, 2006, an outbreak of chikungunya disease on La R\u00e9union Island in France resulted in one-third of residents becoming infected. During this outbreak, the virus was also transmitted to south India (Parola et al., 2006) and southern Europe, including Italy and France (Gould et al., 2010, Rezza et al., 2007). Furthermore, the Carribean has been affected by an outbreak of chikungunya disease since December 2013, and the virus has become a public health threat in central America (Weaver and Forrester, 2015). Together, the two aforementioned outbreaks has led to hundreds of deaths and caused more than one million people to fall ill (Mavalankar et al., 2007, Weaver and Forrester, 2015). Symptoms of chikungunya disease include high fever, arthritis, arthralgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, and conjunctivitis. Some patients also suffer from severe joint pain for weeks or months (Burt et al., 2012, Weaver and Lecuit, 2015).",

Upon entry, the endosome undergoes acidification, which can lead to conformational changes in CHIKV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 (Voss et al., 2010). Envelop glycoproteins then form trimers, which cause the viral membrane and the endosome membrane to fuse together, forming a pore (i.e. the fusion phase) (van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015). The viral genome is then released into the cytosol.",

The 49S genomic RNA encodes four non-structural proteins which are responsible for viral genome synthesis (i.e. genome synthesis). CHIKV envelope glycoproteins and capsid proteins are translated by 26S subgenomic RNA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then are delivered into Golgi apparatus for further processing and glycosylation. Those structural proteins form the spike complexes pE2-E1, which are transported to the plasma membrane. Finally, the spike complexes are assembled with the nucleocapsid cores (Schwartz and Albert, 2010, van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015); and the viruses bud out and release to become mature virions (i.e. the release phase). CHIKV can also be spread through cell-to-cell transmission, which allows virions to efficiently avoid attacks from the host immune system (Hahon and Zimmerman, 1970).",

            "text": "Antiviral drugs are developed to disrupt the life cycle of virus. As indicated, the four main steps of viral multiplication include binding, fusion, genome synthesis, and transmission (including release and cell-to-cell transmission) (Abdelnabi et al., 2015, Parashar and Cherian, 2014). Virus fusion is a critical step of CHIKV infection. The fusion process is dependent on low-pH and the presence of cholesterol (Kuo et al., 2011); (Kuo et al., 2012). Similar findings have been reported for the Sindbis virus (SINV) and the Semliki forest virus (SFV) (Boggs et al., 1989, Chanel-Vos and Kielian, 2004, Kempf et al., 1987, Lanzrein et al., 1993). Therefore, fusion inhibitors are potential candidates for anti-CHIKV drugs. In this report, we described the use of an CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay that uses baculovirus-based expression as a high-throughput screening (HTS) system to search for novel anti-CHIKV drugs (Macarron et al., 2011). We also discussed the effects and mechanisms of two potential anti-CHIKV candidates, niclosamide and nitazoxanide. Our results suggested that the antiviral properties of niclosamide, and nitazoxanide made them promising compounds for further development of anti-CHIKV drugs.",

The above results show that both niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit CHIKV entry and disrupt the release of CHIKV virions. Therefore, we analyzed the roles that niclosamide and nitazoxanide played in cell-to-cell transmission. BHK-21 cells were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of 0.001 for 1 h incubation and then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing CHIKV neutralization antibodies and the indicated drugs.

The infected area was determined by dsRNA staining. As shown in Fig. 6\nA, both niclosamide and nitazoxanide significantly reduced the area of CHIKV infection.

Cell-to-cell transmission is considered an important transmission pathway and allows viruses to avoid attacks by immune system. Previous studies indicated that CHIKV structural proteins might involve not only in virus binding and fusion but also virus release (Masrinoul et al., 2014) and cell-to-cell transmission (Lee et al., 2011). Our previous study indicated that suramin was able to inhibit virus entry, fusion, release and cell-to-cell transmission (Ho et al., 2015). The above data had proved that niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit virus entry and release. Furthermore, niclosamide and nitazoxanide were tested and found to significantly suppress cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV infection. This study is the first to demonstrate that those two compounds can inhibit the cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV infection.",

Using this platform, we found and determined that niclosamide and nitazoxanide possessed the anti-CHIKV abilities. Further investigated those two compounds can affect CHIKV entry and transmission and also possess broad anti-alphaviruses abilities. Niclosamide and nitazoxanide could be used for the development of anti-CHIKV or anti-alphavirus drugs in the future. Formulation altering or combining with other anti-CHIKV drugs were able to improve drug efficacy and reduce their dosage. Besides, through structure modification to find some novel derivatives was also another way to develop safe and efficacious anti-CHIKV drugs.",
