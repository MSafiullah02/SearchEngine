Before January 31, the number of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was more than that of close contacts. Since then, new cases per day were primarily composed of close contacts. The remarkably increased number of close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 indicated that people were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 was important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies [10, 11] . This result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted in Jiangsu Province, and the second-generation transmitted cases appeared. The epidemiology of human infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Jiangsu was also found in other areas outside Hubei Province [12, 13] . A few cases were confirmed whether residents or travelers to Hubei Province or close contacts. Finding out whether the cases were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in transportation facility or destination was difficult. Therefore, wartime control measures for COVID-2019, including limited population movements, were coercive but feasible [14] . One reported case on February 6 and another case on February 13 without exposure history to COVID-2019 in Wuxi was feared. This finding suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 might begin to spread in the community, and close communication with one another should be prohibited [15] . However, from February Research suggests that the main route of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is probably through touch and respiratory droplets with an estimated reproductive number (R0) of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9) [18] . Compared to MERS and SARS, SARS-Cov-2 has higher overall human-to-human transmission potential [19] .",

Results: The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases. The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0% to 58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined. The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou. The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people). The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province. The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases. Conclusion: The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked",

Traffic health quarantine Set up temporary traffic health quarantine station in traffic stations and ports of entry and exit to conduct quarantine inspection for travelers. All confirmed COVID-19 cases and suspected COVID-19 cases are temporarily isolated, detention for check-up and transferred to institutions designated by local health and family planning departments. 7. The residential districts, townships (towns), as well as the neighborhood committees and village committees shall help the administrative departments of public health, medical institutions and other departments collecting and reporting outbreak information, scattering and isolating people, implementing public health measures. Since February 19, no new confirmed cases have been found in Jiangsu\uff0c province , China for 6 consecutive days. The People's Government of Jiangsu Province decided to adjust the emergency response level of epidemic prevention and control from so-called wartime control measures (the first-level response) to the second-level response since 24:00 on February 24.",

This result further indicated that wartime control measures, including limiting communication with one another implemented in Jiangsu Province, possibly prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution of confirmed COVID-2019 cases in Jiangsu Province, all 13 cities confirmed that new imported cases were reported only four days after the first confirmed case. This result indicated that the people of Jiangsu and the people of Hubei had a frequent contact because of developed modern traffic, which brought certain difficulties in preventing and controlling COVID-199[14, 16, 17]. People who arrived in Jiangsu before the implementation of wartime control measures were gradually diagnosed as suffering from COVID-2019 after the incubation period of COVID-2019. Therefore, a short peak of COVID-2019 appeared in each city. These cases were geographically concentrated in three large cities (Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Suzhou) with a high population density, which can accelerate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the people [7]. However, no new case was confirmed on February 19, indicating that the implementation of wartime control measures resulted in reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

More seriously for China, each city facing a huge increase in people returning from trips after the Chinese Spring Festival vacation may result in recurrence of outbreak, despite wartime control measures have partly prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, wartime control measures should continue in China. With the development of convenient transport facilities, the intercommunications among countries are more frequent. The epidemic of COVID-2019 has also spread to other countries from China. Billions of people in 23 other countries including the USA, South Korea, Germany, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have been hugely threatened with the spread of 2019-nCoV. In light of measures introduced by China, limiting travel and trade might be an advisable option. Our analyses had several limitations. First, the data were from the website of Bureau of Health and Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, Jiangsu Province, China. Analyzing the transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 among the people was difficult because of the lack of detailed case information. Second, based on the time of diagnosis instead of the time of onset, the time distribution of cases resulted in the effect of time lag on the epidemic of COVID-19 and error of the incubation calculation. This study showed that the number of new COVID-19 cases per day increased at first and then were gradually reduced to zero after the implementation of wartime control measures in Jiangsu Province. However, considerable attention should be paid to the peak of population mobility after the Spring Festival. Concrete information that can influence the epidemic of COVID-19, such as the source and destination of the floating population and the incidence of disease in each area, should be acquired. The number of daily confirmed new cases peaked and then declined over calendar time in Jiangsu Province. After the implementation of wartime control measures, the proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province gradually declined, whereas that of confirmed cases who were close contacts increased gradually. Finally, no new case was reported. This result emphasized that wartime control measures could inhibit the epidemic of COVID-19.",
