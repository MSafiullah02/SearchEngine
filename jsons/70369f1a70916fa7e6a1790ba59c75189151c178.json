On March 28, the Japanese 8 government decided on the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\", and called on 9 the public to implement social distancing measures (i.e. behavioral restrictions to limit the 10 frequency and intensity of interpersonal contact), with an emphasis on telework. 4 In this study, 11 population-level questionnaire results were used to evaluate the relationship between telework 12 implementation and the presence of a fever, defined as a body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C within 13 one month, as an surrogate indicator of COVID-19 infection, by occupation type and age group. Prefecture, the second most populous prefecture in Japan with about 17 9 million people, launched an individualized support program for residents using the LINE chatbot 18 (the largest social communication application in Japan with about 83 million active users, 19 accounting for 65% of Japan's population) as a way to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and 20 associated societal factors. Through LINE, the prefecture shared a questionnaire that asks users 21 about their current and past month's physical condition and what type of actions they are taking to 22 prevent infections. It also asks about gender, age, and occupation. After filling in the questionnaire, 23 users were provided with personalized information on how to prevent infection. We obtained and 24 analyzed data on the initial responses of individuals in Kanagawa Prefecture.",

Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, we expect that the results will be used as one of the 20 scientific evidence to support the social adoption of telework in Japan.",
