Subsequently, their pathogenicity and ability to undergo rapid evolutionary change 6 has sparked a large body of research, often connected to the so-called 'microevolution' of relatively closely related viruses 7, 8 . However, over the last decade, our appreciation of the importance and distribution of viruses has expanded beyond the original parasitic-pathogen model, and now virologists recognize the role of viruses in host regulation and the maintenance of natural ecosystems 9 . Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has also revealed the presence of a vast variety of viruses in diverse environmental samples and in apparently healthy organisms from all divisions of life [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Nowadays, formal virus classification emphasizes comparative sequence analyses of conserved genes and proteins, including gene phylogeny, gene synteny and shared gene content.

Thus, there was little impetus to extend the taxonomy rank structure. The result was a taxonomy that, in profound contrast to its cellular counterparts, included many disjointed taxa, the number of which increases with the accelerating discovery of novel viruses (exceeding 100 families in 2018). However, classification efforts continued outside of the official taxonomic framework and, over the last few decades, several informal groupings such as 'supergroups' or 'superfamilies' were proposed for subsets of RNA viruses [21] [22] [23] and DNA viruses [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . These groupings relate to otherwise seemingly disparate viruses belonging to different families and have a variety of different hosts, genome types and organizations, and replication mechanisms. Importantly, these groupings have relied on distant relationships often associated with structure-function hypotheses (for example, an essential virus protein involved in virus replication or virion morphogenesis), which were then validated in subsequent experimental studies [29] [30] [31] ; these provided independent support for the inferred classifications.",

Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.",

Figuratively speaking, a taxonomic hierarchy was sought that could accommodate a virosphere-wide tree (or trees) from the roots to the tips of the branches. Because of its potential impact on the practice of virus taxonomy, the EC created a Working Group to consider the matter in more detail.

As virus discovery continues, taxonomy is expected to advance and the process for soliciting changes in the taxonomy is as follows. The process begins with the submission of a taxonomic proposal (TaxoProp) to the ICTV EC. Any virologist can submit a TaxoProp addressing the creation, revision or dissolution of taxa, or nomenclature changes. Each TaxoProp is reviewed by the EC, considering the recommendations of relevant Study Groups. These Study Groups (often the authors or co-authors of TaxoProps) are tasked with the taxonomic development of specific families or other high-rank taxa as well as the development of demarcation criteria used to define taxa at different ranks. An EC-approved TaxoProp is then considered for ratification by the entire ICTV membership (see Box 1). Irrespective of whether a TaxoProp addresses virus taxonomy at the lower or higher ranks, taxonomic changes have to be substantiated. Importantly, each TaxoProp is publicly posted for comment and all comments are taken into consideration at all stages of TaxoProp evaluation. Virus taxonomy is not set in stone, and virologists may challenge any taxon or its rank assignment with new data or concepts using persuasive scientific arguments.",

This group produced a Consultation Report and then an official Taxo-Prop, which became available at the ICTV website for public discussion 48 . The Working Group considered the number of ranks that should be allowed by the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN; 'the Code') under three main premises: (1) virus discovery will continue at an accelerating pace, which will help to establish links between distantly related viruses; (2) virus taxonomy will continue to develop to reflect the evolutionary relationships of viruses; and (3) advances in comparative genomics will provide the necessary tools for defining natural groups of viruses over the full scale of virus divergence. The deliberations also included a 'thought exercise' that used the informal hierarchical groupings of diverse RNA virus subsets (starting from poliovirus and other picornaviruses and concluding with all RNA viruses) to define the number of ranks that may be needed in a fully inclusive virus classification. The group recommended an extended rank structure of virus taxonomy that was subsequently approved by the ICTV. Virologists active in comparative genomics now have the opportunity to test their discoveries and theories on all aspects of virus classification through the ICTV-mediated process (see refs. 49, 50 ) and its engagement with the wider community of virologists.

Intra-cluster virus divergence, which increases from the virus to the species rank to the realm rank, is represented by the increasing width of the respective rectangles, which are not drawn to scale. EBOV is most closely related to, but distinct from, Bombali, Bundibugyo, Reston, Sudan and Ta\u00ef Forest viruses, which belong to separate species included in the Ebolavirus genus. SARS-CoV is one of several closely related coronaviruses isolated from humans and animals, such as palm civets and bats, and are included in the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. Herpes simplex virus 1 is one of two human herpesviruses belonging to different species in the Simplexvirus genus.

Genomic sequences of ebolaviruses of different species differ from each other by \u226523%. Genomic sequences of filoviruses of different genera differ from each other by \u226555%. Genomic features, such as number and location of gene overlaps, ebolavirus host and geographic distribution, and ebolavirus pathogenicity for different organisms, are also considered for species assignment, while genomic features, such as number and location of gene overlaps, number of open reading frames (ORFs) and/or genes, filovirus host and geographic distribution, and filovirus pathogenicity for different organisms, are also taken into account for genus assignment. Phylogenetic relationships across the genus have been established from maximum likelihood trees generated using coding-complete or complete genome sequences or by analysing filovirus large protein amino acid sequences 43 . b Nidovirus taxa demarcation and rank assignment were defined by DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering (DEmARC) analysis, a distance-based method with improved predictive power 44 and inferred biological relevance 45 . The analysis sought minima of clustering cost in the distribution of pairwise distances derived from a maximum likelihood tree of the concatenated 3CLPro, NiRAN, RdRP, ZBD and HEL domains of the replicase polyprotein in all available sequences of viruses of the suborder Cornidovirineae. These minimum numbers were converted into percentages of amino acid identity that serve as a proxy for the selected minima. For the demarcation of the suborders, the order-wide analysis was performed. Members of the species, subgenus, genus, subfamily and family taxa form phylogenetically compact lineages in the Coronaviridae tree. Members of the suborder taxa form phylogenetically compact lineages in the Nidovirales tree (see ref. 46 ). 3CLpro, 3C-like protease; NiRAN, nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; RdRp, RNA-directed RNA polymerase; ZBD, Zn-binding domain covalently linked to HEL1; HEL1, helicase of superfamily 1. and the demarcation criteria that define the taxa. Only at the basal, realm rank are the two viruses included in the same taxon, Riboviria. Figure 2 also shows the corresponding information for another human pathogen, herpes simplex virus 1, which has a double-stranded DNA genome and is currently assigned to taxa of five 'traditional' ranks. A surge of activity to populate the existing and additional ranks of virus taxonomy can now be expected and is to be encouraged. This will include the consideration of numerous supergroups and superfamilies that have remained outside of virus taxonomy to date. At the time of writing (January 2020), the ranks included highly different numbers of taxa (Fig. 1) . As expected, the species rank, with the lowest degree of intra-taxon virus divergence, is the most heavily populated, and ranks with higher degrees of intra-taxon divergence are the least populated. This highly uneven distribution of the number of taxa assigned at different ranks is due not only to the hierarchical relationship of the ranks, but also to the very recent introduction of the more basal ranks, and the lack of requirement to fill these ranks. The uneven distribution also reflects variations in the sampling of different virus lineages in diverse hosts as well as differences in the approaches adopted for the recognition of taxa in particular species by different ICTV Study Groups.",
