Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this 19 virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a 20 prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections 21 by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target 22 complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed 23 to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein 24 gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from 25 around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid 26 phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of 27",

Initial symptoms of this disease mainly include fever, 39 cough, fatigue, dyspnea & headache [1, 2] or it may be asymptomatic [3] . The spike glycoprotein of 40 SARS-CoV-2 binds directly with the surface cell angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor 41 present on alveolar epithelial cells of lung facilitating virus entry, replication and triggers cytokine 42 cascade mechanism [4] . In severe cases, patient may die due to massive alveolar damage and 43 progressive respiratory failure [1, 5] . The current detection process of SARS-CoV-2 carried out by 44 most countries is using real-time RT-PCR, although several other methods are also being 45 developed [6] [7] [8] .
