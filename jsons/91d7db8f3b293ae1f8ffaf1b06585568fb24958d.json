It involved a systematic literature review of 101 papers from 53 journals focusing on the publication outlets, yearly trends, themes, and associated theoretical and conceptual approaches, methodologies, sources and geographical distribution of digital entrepreneurship research. The findings suggest that extant literature mostly lacked sound theoretical underpinnings. More work adopting appropriate and proven theoretical approaches is needed. Most of the reviewed papers also focused mainly on issues relating to the technology itself than those relating to the enterprise or the entrepreneur. The capabilities and capacities of enterprises, as well as the strategies in implementing digital technologies and harnessing the opportunities of digitalization, are key issues that have not hitherto received much attention. The study contributes to the understanding of the conceptualization of the digital entrepreneurship phenomenon. Future research should consolidate the understanding of the field, with models and frameworks that recognize digital entrepreneurship as an academic research field in its own right, and also consider the impact of enterprise capabilities and capacities on digital entrepreneurship.",

Moreover, there has also been a lack of contextual and conceptual development and discussion of the concept of digital entrepreneurship, as most prior research examined only the sporadic phenomena associated with it [42, 50] . Furthermore, some critical and fundamental issues about digital entrepreneurship currently remain unresolved in the literature. These include how digital technologies transform entrepreneurship, how digital entrepreneurship predicts performance outcomes, and how digital entrepreneurship differs from traditional entrepreneurship [48, 50] . Meanwhile, not much has been done in terms of reviewing the body of literature and research trends in digital entrepreneurship, so the need for conceptualisations in the field is much desired [34] .",

The searches for articles were conducted in six electronic databases for which the researcher had full-text access: ScienceDirect/Elsevier, Emerald, AIS Library, Sage, Springer, and Taylor and Francis. Although these databases may not exhaustively list all relevant journals, they, however, cover a reasonable portion of the existing database for IS journals. As Levy and Ellis, [29] noted in their guide to a systematic approach to a literature review in IS, it is better to use multiple databases in conducting literature searches, since the IS domain is multidisciplinary and IS literature outlets are highly diversified. Quality IS literature is dispersed through-out hundreds of databases and some of the databases used in this study, being multidisciplinary, are among those recommended by Levy and Ellis, [29] as useful for IS research. Moreover, most journals in these databases are globally topranked IS journals [4] . Against this backdrop, the list of databases above was a fair and adequate representation of the relevant IS databases suited for digital entrepreneurship study, which is a multidisciplinary subject.",

Meanwhile, of the 13 papers focusing on entrepreneur related issues, 5 focused on the entrepreneur's perspectives, perceptions and behaviour; 3 on entrepreneur's gender, race and class; 3 on entrepreneurial competence and another 3 on ownership and management.

The theory-based studies focused on enterprise-related issues such as business model, value, process, innovation, and transformation, as well as competition, expansion, marketing, and strategic orientation. The review also shows that some of the studies with no theories could have been underpinned with applicable theories in IS literature such as social theories, sociotechnical theories, institutional theories and the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) theoretical framework which could explain the assumptions on which many of the publications were conducted [6, 38, 43] .",

Meanwhile, the data sources and methods used are also influenced by the level of research development in the field of inquiry [25] . In relatively new areas of research, obtaining secondary data or the adoption of a literature review approach may be hampered. The limited use of secondary data sources in many of the works published in this area reflects the relative newness of the field. This assertion is also reflected in the research approach that was employed in the study. From the results, it is clear that the most widely used methods were a survey, case study, literature review, and interviews. The use of the case studies and interviews suggest that more exploratory and descriptive questions are being asked at the same time that rigor is being sought through surveys. The greater use of the research approaches mentioned above, compared to others, suggests that many of the papers were focused on discovering and describing phenomena related to digital entrepreneurship [25] . Interestingly of the 35 papers that used a case study or interview methods, 21 of them have no theory base, which further emphasizes the exploratory and descriptive purposes. The focus of such papers included adoption, impact, influence and use of digital technologies like social media, e-business, enterprise systems and crowdsourcing [15, 28] .",

Another limitation is the restriction of the study to articles published between 2013 and 2018. Such limitations would result in some appropriate articles being eluded. Future research could expand on the database and also consider other forms of digital entrepreneurship. Only a few of the studies discussed had sound theoretical underpinnings. A major gap identified, is the limited use of theoretical and conceptual frameworks that would bring the concept of digital entrepreneurship up to par with major areas of academic inquiry in IS research. Meanwhile, for studies in digital entrepreneurship to acquire some eminence in the IS research purview, more work adopting appropriate and proven theoretical approaches is needed. Few papers focused on issues relating to the enterprise while much fewer papers focused on the entrepreneur. Future research should consider the drivers and motivation of the entrepreneur for digital entrepreneurship. The capabilities and capacities of enterprises, as well as the strategies in implementing digital technologies and harnessing the opportunities of digitalization, are key issues that have not hitherto received much attention.",

Apart from an insignificant drop from six in 2013 to five in 2014, the increment was consistent, as the number of papers increased to 13 in 2015, 14 in 2016, 30 in 2017, and 33 in 2018.
