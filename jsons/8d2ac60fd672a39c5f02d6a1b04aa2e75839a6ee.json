For this purpose a special class of branching processes with two types of individuals is considered. These models are intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the infection and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the infected individuals. Similar problems are considered also in the case when the processes admit an immigration component. This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the officially reported data are not sufficient for estimation of the model parameters. In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered also for all countries as it is given in the specially created site http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19 where the obtained results are updated daily.",

In the critical case the mean value of the process with immigration grows linearly while for the process without immigration the mean value is constant. In the subcritical case the mean value of the immigration process converges to a positive constant but for the process without immigration the mean value goes to zero. The estimation of the immigration mean a is a serious problem because this parameter cannot be estimated by the observed data and one needs additional information. Hence the processes with immigration need more careful investigation.",

The behaviour of the estimators shows that the observed processes are able to change the criticality during the development of the epidemics. The estimated values for the main epidemical parameter m vary greater than 1, equal (or very closed) to 1 and even less than 1. Moreover it seems that the real epidemic process develops like a mixture of both type of the models with and without immigration. In this case four stages of epidemic development are available: exponential growth (m > 1), linear growth (m = 1 and an immigration component), non-increasing and almost stable population (due to m = 1 or m < 1 with an immigration component), convergence to zero (extinction of the epidemics due to m < 1 without immigration). It is obvious that the restriction of the immigration component is very important to the limitation of the epidemic process. It seems that in some countries exist some regions which can be considered as immigration sources for the other regions and in general for the whole country. The abroad immigration plays also an important role.",

The mean values of the expected number of nonregistered infected individuals are calculated for the Harris estimator as M 1 (s + k) = m 0 m s+k = M 1 (s)m k . Here, instead of m 0 the value of M 1 (s) is estimated by the registered contaminated individuals in day s.
