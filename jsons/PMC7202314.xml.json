            "text": "Ciliates and other protoctists are believed to play a significant metabolic role in freshwater systems (Wetzel, 1983; Beaver & Crisman, 1989). In marine environments, ciliates have been recognised as an important link between bacteria and pelagic zooplankters in a \u2018microbial loop\u2019 (e.g. Sleigh, 1989; Pierce & Turner, 1992), and, in Lake Michigan, experimental studies have shown that a large fraction of picoplankton carbon is directly transferred to higher trophic levels via a picoplankton\u2010protoctist\u2010zooplankton coupling (Carrick et al., 1991). Ciliates are believed not only to route energy through their consumption of primary producers and subsequent ingestion by predaceous and detritivorous metazoans (Sleigh, 1989; Wickham, 1995), but also as photosynthesizers via phytoflagellate symbionts (Sorokin, 1999). High rates of growth and reproduction make ciliates major organic matter transformers.",

Such information as does exist has come primarily from large lentic bodies, such as lakes (Goulder, 1974; Petersen, 1990; James, Burns & Forsyth, 1995) and reservoirs (Salvado & Gracia, 1991), with some studies also having been carried out in running waters (Taylor, 1981; Madoni, 1983; Baldock & Sleigh, 1988). A few studies have considered the seasonal development of ciliates in ponds (Groli\u00e8re & Njine, 1973; Kusano, Kusano & Watanabe, 1987; Guhl, Finlay & Schink, 1994; Finlay & Esteban, 1998), but almost no data are available from temporary freshwater ponds \u2013 in which metazoans demonstrate interesting traits related to the transient nature of the habitat (Williams, 2001).",

Pond II was smaller (\u223c0.25 ha) but deeper (maximum 66 cm) and held water from 7 April until 17 May (34 days).

Ciliate samples were taken by submerging a closed 35 cm3 container adjacent to the substrate, removing the lid and sealing it once full. Two such replicates were taken at each sampling site and these were pooled in the field. Because of the time required to identify the large number of species present, only samples from Pond I were examined alive, those from Pond II were preserved with mercury chloride. After thorough mixing, 10 cm3 were withdrawn from each of the 280 cm3 samples, and placed in an Uterm\u00f6hl chamber (Phyco Tech Inc., MI, USA); fresh and preserved samples were treated identically. After settling, the ciliates were examined under an inverted microscope. Species in low abundance were concentrated using vacuum filtering (1.2 \u03bcm) under low pressure. Identifications were always made on live specimens, using the following keys: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1935); Bick (1972); Corliss (1979); 1982, 1983); Foissner et al.

Six, water\u2010tight, galvanised sheet\u2010metal enclosures, each measuring 2.3 m in diameter and 0.7 m in height, were installed in each pond prior to snowmelt. They were randomly located within relatively homogeneous areas of depth, substrate and exposure, and were forced into the bed to a depth of approximately 10 cm, effectively corralling sections of pond. Within each pond, two of the enclosures were covered with a fine (1 mm), white mesh that excluded the entry of aerially colonising insect predators (primarily Coleoptera and Odonata) \u2013 although they may subsequently have contained predators that hatched from dormant eggs laid on the pond bottom in the previous year. Another two enclosures served as \u2018predator addition\u2019 manipulations to which were added, weekly, specimens of the seasonally predominant predators present in the ponds. This amounted to a total of 30 beetle larvae (Rhantus sp., Agabus sp., Acilius sp.) added to each enclosure in Pond I (on days 28, 35 and 42) and 20 in the Pond II enclosures (on days 27 and 34). A total of 120 dragonfly nymphs (Sympetrum obtrusum, S. internum, S. costiferum) was also added to each of the two enclosures in Pond I (on days 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84). No odonates were added to Pond II as it had dried up by this time. The last two enclosures in each pond served as controls in an attempt to determine any enclosure effects. Thus alongside the samples taken from the ponds themselves, termed \u2018outside enclosures\u2019, samples of water, chlorophyll a and ciliates were also taken from each of the three treatments.",

In both ponds, outside the enclosures, water temperatures, turbidity, nitrate, ammonia (higher in Pond I) and total phosphorus (more variable in Pond I) steadily increased until they reached a maximum prior to dry up (1, 2). Conductivity inversely followed water depth. The pH tended to become lower over the aquatic phase in Pond I (range: 5.5\u20136.4) but increased in Pond II (range: 6.8\u20137.3). Dissolved oxygen dropped by a similar amount in both ponds, but the start and end concentrations were lower in Pond I.

This was the case also for Pond I in terms of depth, temperature and ammonia, although pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen were occasionally higher in the enclosures (P < 0.01 from a repeated measures anova; Fig. 1). Although initially very similar to the concentrations in the pond, Pond I enclosures showed marked decreases in nitrate, total phosphorus and turbidity prior to dry up (P < 0.05 from a repeated measures anova). Chlorophyll a levels in the Pond I enclosures were very similar to those in the outside water until around day 28, the beginning of the predator addition treatment. Thereafter, the enclosure controls and both predator\u2010manipulation treatments (especially the predator addition) rose significantly above background levels (P < 0.01; Fig. 1). Chlorophyll a levels in Pond II were similar amongst all treatments and controls (P = 0.78; Fig. 2). Chlorophyll a levels were generally higher in Pond I, with maxima occurring at the beginning of the hydroperiod in Pond II but much later (May to June) in Pond I.

However, species richness in Pond I rose to near Pond II levels towards the end of its own hydroperiod (around day 98). Cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 \u00b1 4 species), followed by the partial predator exclusion enclosures (50 \u00b1 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 \u00b1 2) and in the pond controls (39 \u00b1 0). As these two controls were similar, the differences seen in the others were likely the result of predator manipulation rather than because of enclosure effects. Interestingly, there was some increase in both the predator addition enclosures before the predators were added. After addition, these increases became larger. The results obtained in Pond II were less convincing: predator addition (54 \u00b1 3), partial predator exclusion (50 \u00b1 7), enclosure controls (44 \u00b1 4) and pond controls (50 \u00b1 3).",

Further, ciliate abundance in permanent waters often shows a bimodal seasonal pattern, with maximum ciliate abundance in spring and autumn co\u2010occurring with thermal mixing (e.g. Goulder, 1971a; M\u00fcller et al., 1991). Ciliate abundance increased as the habitat was drying up in both ponds, possibly as a result of warmer water and other \u2018favourable\u2019 physical conditions in late summer (Wang, 1928). The Vandorf ponds are devoid of any nutrient bursts corresponding to thermal mixing, relying instead on progressive nutrient release from the breakdown of dead aquatic vegetation and riparian leaf litter input from the previous year. Hatano & Watanabe (1981) found that high abundance of bacterivorous protoctists in the leaf litter of a small pond was closely related to litter decomposition in late autumn and spring. Densities of algae were low throughout the season in our ponds, and it is likely that much of the communities in both ponds relied on bacteria for food. Indeed, facultative bacterial feeders were frequently more abundant than facultative algivores. Bacterial counts showed this food source to be three times higher in Pond II, possibly explaining the much higher abundance of ciliates there; although ciliate richness was similar in both ponds.",

For example, Pond II is situated in a hayfield with essentially only one type of vegetation (Phalaris sp.), whereas Pond I supports a wide variety of typical wetland plants. In theory, a more heterogeneous habitat should provide a wider range of microhabitats thereby increasing species richness. Species richness in Pond I increased with time in a fashion similar to that noted in permanent freshwater bodies (M\u00fcller et al., 1991), but this was not so for Pond II. One cautionary note is that differences between the two ponds may have been affected to some extent by identifications made on live and preserved samples (ponds I and II, respectively).

It is known that the abundance of single ciliate species often fluctuates widely in response to availability of a suitable food resource and competition, or predation (Finlay & Esteban, 1998), with seasonal events such as detritus formation by litter feeders in spring, leaf fall in autumn and selective predation, resulting in species replacement (Kusano et al., 1987). Pond II was spatially more homogeneous than Pond I, but temporally more heterogeneous in that each week there was a substantial decrease (\u223c10 cm) in depth.

Other studies, of both freshwater and marine ciliates, have added the following factors: light and oxygen regime, water chemistry, presence of metabolites, and the abundance of predators such as copepods, ostracods and rotifers (Fenchel, 1987; Sleigh, 1989; Pierce & Turner, 1992). Ciliates typically have very short generation times (1\u20132 days) combined with high reproductive capacities, species substitution therefore can occur rapidly. As habitat conditions change, species appear and disappear in association with a large, local diversity of temporarily rare and encysted species. From this \u2018pool\u2019, new species are able to very quickly fill vacant niches (Finlay & Esteban, 1998).",

The literature indicates that both consistency (especially in Epistylis and Strobilidium) and inconsistency in occurrence pattern can be expected over several years in permanent waters (M\u00fcller et al., 1991).",

First, there was more phytoplankton inside the enclosures, as indicated by the chlorophyll a concentrations, and many of the ciliate species recorded were algivores. Although chlorophyll a did not emerge as a significant factor in the stepwise linear regression, Pond I peak in relative abundance of algivorous species corresponded with high chlorophyll a levels between days 42 and 49. Previous studies (see review by Beaver & Crisman, 1989) have found ciliate abundance and biomass to be strongly related to chlorophyll a, and algivorous ciliates in the benthos have been shown to peak in summer when the production rate of benthic algae was high (Stanley, 1972; Fenchel, 1975). In Pond I, the water surface outside the enclosures became densely covered by duckweed (Lemna) from the middle of the hydroperiod onwards, thus reducing the light available to photosynthetic organisms. Accordingly, the pond water had lower chlorophyll a concentrations and thus less food for algivorous ciliates. Madoni (1991) has also shown that a dense cover of Lemna reduces this trophic group. We are uncertain why Lemna, although present, did not thrive in the enclosures. Pond II did not support duckweed, and there the treatments and controls were alike, both in terms of ciliate abundance and chlorophyll a concentrations and the proportion of algal\u2010feeding species was higher (44%).",

Wiackowski, Brett & Goldman (1994) and Jack & Gilbert (1997) have suggested that seasonal succession in the crustacean zooplankton community may be a strong determinant of ciliate community dynamics and composition, and have shown that the relative frequency of small ciliates increases, alongside a decrease in larger ciliates, as zooplankton increases. There was a higher abundance of zooplankton (especially ostracods, cladocerans, cyclopoid and harpacticoid copepods, and large rotifers) outside the enclosures in both ponds I and II (A. K. Magnusson & D. D. Williams, unpublished data). Overall reduction in zooplankton within the enclosures may well have resulted in the higher abundance of ciliates compared with the ponds themselves.",

Both supported a high diversity of species, including many rare species that presumably can exploit the rapidly changing environment that these ponds represent. Length of the hydroperiod was clearly a significant factor in community structure and development, and there was evidence to suggest that dissolved oxygen concentration, amount of light, the availability of phytoplankton as food and the presence of zooplankton as predators, were also influential. Species succession was strongly evident throughout the hydroperiod, as were shifts in cell size. Establishment of the enclosures significantly increased ciliate species richness, probably by broadening the range of niches available.",
