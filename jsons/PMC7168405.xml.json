            "text": "Inteins are genetic elements present in protein coding regions. All the element codes for a protein that is translated together with the coding region of its host gene. The intein protein is removed from the host protein by a protein\u2010splicing reaction that joins the intein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction is autocatalytic, fully catalysed by the intein and the residue C\u2010terminal to it, with no need for other proteins, ATP or such molecules (Paulus, 2000). It is typically a cis intramolecular reaction but can also occur when the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal parts of the intein are split and encoded on separate protein chains, each with its own flank. A trans protein\u2010splicing reaction then ligates the flanks of the two intein parts (Shingledecker et al., 1998; Southworth et al., 1998). A split intein is naturally present in the dnaE genes of a few cyanobacteria (Gorbalenya, 1998; Kaneko et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2002). Inteins are active with various flanks, in heterologous organisms and in vitro. Biochemical studies of the protein\u2010splicing mechanism led to the use of typical and split inteins in diverse biotechnology applications (Perler and Adam, 2000; , Ozawa et al., 2001; Mootz and Muir, 2002).",

Although inteins are widely distributed, present in the three domains of life, they are relatively rare, and about 160 are currently known (Perler, 2002). Moreover, their distribution is discontinuous and irregular, with even closely related species differing in intein presence at homologous integration sites (Liu, 2000; Pietrokovski, 2001). Consequently, intein presence is very difficult to predict.",

            "text": "Intein distribution is the result of two parallel processes. The primary process seems to be independent of gradual loss of intein elements from separate species during evolution (Pietrokovski, 2001). Inteins are not known to contribute any advantage to their host genes or species and are believed to be selfish genetic elements (Belfort et al., 1995). Active selection against inteins seems to be relatively weak because of their apparent negligible disruption of their host genes, protein products and organisms. Intein removal from the genome requires a precise DNA excision event as they are inserted in highly conserved points of genes coding for essential proteins (Derbyshire and Belfort, 1998). Counteracting this slow extinction is horizontal transfer to specific integration points, e.g. homing (Belfort and Roberts, 1997). Most intein proteins include a homing endonuclease domain that can mediate insertion of their intein gene into homologous unoccupied intein integration points (Gimble and Thorner, 1992). Hence, homing activity of inteins can reinsert their gene into integration sites that they were lost from.",

The Ter dnaE1 gene also includes other inteins and group II introns (not shown). The mature DnaE protein in each species is assumed to be ligated by the split intein in a trans protein\u2010splicing reaction from the separately translated DnaE1 and DnaE2 proteins (Wu et al., 1998; , Perler, 1999).",

They could also be a valuable source in theoretical and experimental studies of protein\u2013protein interaction and intein catalytic activity (Gorbalenya, 1998; Martin et al., 2001). From a practical aspect, our ability to obtain an apparently very large number of different DnaE split inteins will be enhanced. For example, the Pasteur Culture Collection of Cyanobacteria (PCC) maintains about 475 axenic strains, many belonging to the groups in which we believe DnaE split inteins are fixed. Of particular interest will be split inteins from species living in extreme conditions such as high temperature or salinity. The protein\u2010splicing activity of these split inteins may depend on the conditions in which their host species are active.",

            "text": "Our hypothesis is that split inteins are very difficult to lose. This is based on the idea that split inteins cannot be lost by one, or even two, simple DNA excision events. Cyanobacterial DnaE proteins are split by inteins in a highly conserved motif appearing in all known DnaE proteins (Fig. 4B). This strongly suggests that the two split DnaE host protein parts would have to be attached by a peptide bond at the intein integration point for the motif to adopt the fold, and have the activity, found in other DnaE proteins. Loss of one or both intein parts will leave the products of their gene flanks split with no mechanism to ligate. To lose the intein genes and retain a functional dnaE gene requires parallel precise loss of the intein parts followed directly by precise fusion of their flanks into one gene; this is a highly unlikely event.",

            "text": "There are more then 50 known intein alleles, but only the cyanobacterial dnaE intein allele is split. Nevertheless, these split inteins are common in cyanobacteria. If split inteins are common, at least in one group of species, why is there only one known type (allele) of them? The rarity of split intein organization probably results from the difficulty in switching to a functional two genes and two products state from a single gene and a single product one. Gene splitting would require acquiring a promoter and translation initiation signal for the downstream part of the split gene, adapting co\u2010regulation for the two formed genes and evolving amino acid sequences to stabilize the two new ends of the intein parts. Gene splitting of the intein might also require adaptation for trans\u2010splicing and high\u2010affinity interaction between the two intein parts. Artificially created split inteins were found to have some affinity between their two parts and a low level of trans\u2010splicing (Shingledecker et al., 1998; Southworth et al., 1998; , Mootz and Muir, 2002). Thus, adapting the protein function of a newly split intein gene might be the minor difficulty compared with adapting proper transcription and translation control and protein stability. Once all these adaptations were complete, the unidirectional ratchet nature of the intein\u2010splitting process would ensure the evolutionary persistence of the gene organization. However, still unknown are what initial circumstances led to the selection of the individual cyanobacterium in which the intein splitting occurred. Significant advantage/s likely to have accompanied this event to compensate for all necessary genetic adjustments are discussed above.",

Next, linear (single primer) amplifications were done towards each split intein part using specific primers, designed from the previously amplified regions. The 3\u2032 (intein) ends of the single\u2010stranded amplification products were tailed by a homo\u2010oligomer using terminal transferase.

This PCR amplification was repeated twice, and the products were cloned and sequenced or sequenced directly. To confirm the resulting sequence, the intein\u2010containing region, together with its adjacent untranslated and dnaE flanks, was amplified from genomic DNA using specific primers and sequenced on both strands (Fig. 3).",
