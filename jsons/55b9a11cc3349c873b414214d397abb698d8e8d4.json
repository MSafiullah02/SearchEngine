We fit the first seventy five days of available daily data since the first diagnosed case and we forecast possible scenarios of contagion associated with different levels of social distancing measures. We determine the initial reproductive transmission rate in Lebanon and its subsequent dynamics. Our results suggest that preserving severe mitigation measures would halt the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, relaxing measures would trigger a second outbreak of infections within a couple of weeks, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation.",

The World Health Organization classified the spread as a pandemic in March 2020 [1] . Europe and the United States of America have endured the severest repercussions in terms of number of infections and deaths. The US cases amounted to about one third of total global infections by April 2020 [2] . Governmental and institutional reactions and measures varied across countries with respect to the time of introduction of social distancing measures (SDM, henceforth) and with respect to their degree of severity. In spite of some governments being slower in adopting mitigation measures and endorsing the epidemiological concept of herd immunity [3] to create a resistance to the contagion in the long run at the expense of short term losses while keeping the economy functional, the majority adopted SDM's that reached countrywide lockdowns.",

            "text": "While the first confirmed case was recorded on February 21, 2020, all academic institutions, namely schools and universities, were closed starting the first of March. This was followed by a resolution of \"Public Mobilization\" and ban of public gatherings that imposed closure of all churches, mosques, shops, restaurants, etc. except for grocery stores and drugstores on March 22 [21] . Another subsequent measure consisted in constraining vehicles' mobility to alternating between odd-and even-ending plate numbers, while fully prohibiting mobility on Sundays. The source of the first infection was documented to be from a traveler coming from Iran [22, 23] where the spread of the virus had started early on [24] . However, it has been discussed that many of the following first cases were transmitted by travelers coming from the Vatican city during the early stages of the pandemic spread there [25] . The efficacy of SDM's can be examined by discerning the daily rate of infection as shown in the daily data of the first seventy five days [26] . Our results were obtained in relation to data available until May 9, 2020. Literature and Methodology Models exploring contagion and particularly spread of infections were developed and extensively studied in various fields of mathematics, physics, economics and statistics [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] . The effect of mitigation measures on the spread of infections was studied in [35, 36, 37, 38] . It was shown that the use of protective masks [39] , combined with social distancing, ensures high levels of safety and protection. We establish our study of the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread in Lebanon on three models that have been used in analogous studies of infectious diseases including COVID-19 worldwide and in other countries, namely: the SEIR model [40, 41, 42] , the repeated iterations model presented in [43] (henceforth the RI model) and the Fermi-Dirac-like model of [44] . We use a daily data of the Coronavirus in Lebanon provided by mainly the Ministry of Public Health [26] over the length of seventy five days.",

Figure 2 illustrates the progression of the number of daily infections over time in different countries: Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, Italy and the USA. Day 0 represents the date of the first reported infection. Lebanon has a relatively low number of infections per capita, despite the fact that the first case was recorded relatively early.

Consider a population N that we normalize to size 1 and divide into four categories of individuals: susceptible S, exposed E, infectious I and removed (through recovery or death) R. The cumulative number of cases is provided by C = I + R, since each recorded case would at a given time be either infectious or recovered or dead. The rates of change of these categories are given by dS dt , dE dt , dI dt and dR dt respectively. The model can be formally described using the following differential equations:",

The estimation of R 0 and R t is essential for forecasting the spread, but their determination depends on the available data and the accuracy of the reporting of initial cases and dates. More accurate values of R 0 and R t usually become available after the maturation of the spread [57, 58] .",

This parameterization supplies an accurate fit with the registered cases for the However, if the measures are relaxed at a time t 2 = 80 days, we expect a an increase in the reproductive rate from R 1 to a another constant value R 2 . The exact value of R 2 will still depend on the extent of relaxation and the public commitment to SDM. We considered here four possible values of R 2 : Continued strict mitigation measures with R 2 = R 1 = 0.65, a continued commitment to measures with weak relaxation is parameterized by R 2 = 1.3 while more public social interaction and moderate relaxation is parameterized by R 2 = 1.9. The last choice is R 2 = 2.5, corresponding to wide relaxation, yet panic among people helps in preventing R 2 from returning back to high values as those of the initial rate R 0 . We find out that the cumulative number of infections will rise again at a higher pace as depicted in Figure 4 even for the lowest increase in R 2 . The number of cumulative infections can reach a total varying between 1791 to more than 8271 infections in July 2020, depending on the extent of relaxation. On the contrary, a continued commitment to SDM measures on the same levels as R 1 would lead to a controlled total of 1086 infections by then. This means that the disease can swiftly spread again once the measures are relaxed, and the pace of the spread would depend on the level of official and public relaxation of mitigation measures. This is a result numerically specific to Lebanon, but the general pattern is a universal outcome and means that a second wave of COVID-19 infections is inevitable in absence or weakening of SDM.",

We analyzed in detail the current spread and different forecasts for future developments. We find out that the rate of infection and the number of infected people fell down quickly due to the rapid fall in the reproductive number R due to strong mitigation measures. However, relaxing the measures and the resumption of social activity and interaction would swiftly put the infections on a rapid rise again, thus reversing the temporary success in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Attacking the disease from different angles allows us to show in different ways that the temporary official and public SDM have succeeded in halting the spread of the disease, but the resumption of business and life as usual will put the spread back on track of fast growth. Consequently, SDM should be maintained in order to safely guarantee controlled spread.",

In addition to absence of any SDM, a relatively high value of R 0 could be attributed to late reporting or under reporting of the early cases, hence the fast surge of registered results during the first few days of official testing. R 0 here reflects the fast pace of spread of the disease in the early days before taking and implementing social distancing measures. The rapid fall of the rate from R 0 to R 1 occurs after the implementation and the social commitment to mitigation measures, hence the rapid decrease in the number of daily infections and the slow increase in the cumulative number of infections. The very low rate of R 1 sharply diminishes the number of new infections, and the curve of the cumulative number of infections (Figure 2) starts flattening out slowly.",
