In the absence of an available licensed vaccine and antiviral agent, therapeutic human antibodies have been suggested as candidates for treatment. In this study, human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by sorting B cells from patient's PBMC cells with prefusion stabilized spike (S) probes and a direct immunoglobulin cloning strategy. We identified six receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific and five S1 (non-RBD)-specific antibodies, among which, only the RBD-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing potency (IC 50 0.006-1.787 \u03bcg/ml) as well as high affinity to RBD. Notably, passive immunization using a highly potent antibody (KNIH90-F1) at a relatively low dose (2 mg/kg) completely protected transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 against MERS-CoV lethal challenge. These results suggested that human monoclonal antibodies isolated by using the rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV S probe could be considered potential candidates for the development of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antiviral agents for MERS-CoV human infection.",

            "text": "No vaccine or therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention and treatment against MERS-CoV infection to date. Several laboratory studies proposed vaccine candidates, based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) antigen, which induce neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies inhibit RBD from binding the host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4; also known as CD26) [4] , An alternative strategy is to use virus-specific therapeutic human antibodies that can be rapidly developed to neutralize the virus during infection. Indeed, some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from humans using various platforms have shown considerable MERS-CoV-neutralizing potency along with therapeutic or prophylactic efficacies in animal models [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Additionally, nanobodies and camel/human hybrid antibodies have been suggested for treatment of viral infection [13, 14] . Most recently, a research group isolated mAbs from a MERS patient via B cell immortalization, which showed promising therapeutic and prophylactic potential against MERS-CoV infection in a mouse model [8] . Moreover, targeting multiple antigenic sites on spike might be advantageous, suggesting the possibility of combination therapy with RBD-specific antibodies for escape-mutant prevention [11, 15] . To date, two phase I human clinical trials of therapeutic antibody candidates, humanized mAbs (REGN3048, REGN3051) and human polyclonal anti-MERS immunoglobulin G (IgG; SAB-301) from transchromosomic cattle have been completed [16, 17] . The clinical trial result of SAB-301 shows that SAB-301 appears to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals, encouraging expectations for the development of MERS therapeutics [16] .",

Several strategies are available for the development of therapeutic human mAbs for viral infections; in the present study, we isolated single B cells from patients for development. A MERS-CoV S antigen trimer probe (S-2P) was designed to retain betacoronavirus S proteins in the prefusion conformation [20] . It increased antigenicity and affinity binding to hDPP4. It also elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice. Previous reports, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HIV and RSV, showed that structure-designed stabilization of the viral surface protein by mutations induced greater neutralizing mAbs than postfusion proteins [20] [21] [22] [23] .Thus, we rationally designed a strategy to develop the potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection by using an S-2P. We directly isolated B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of convalescent patients using an S-2P for cell sorting, cloned the IgG genes, and produced antibodies through cell culture [15] . We also evaluated the binding affinity for S protein and the RBD of the obtained mAbs and determined the neutralizing ability with a pseudovirus and plaque-reduction neutralizing assay (PRNT) in vitro. Finally, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of the mAb with the strongest neutralizing activity in transgenic (TG) mice challenged with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. These results offer a new platform and antibody for prompt development toward clinical trials.",

Prior to lethal challenge, 50% mean lethal dose (LD 50 ) in mice was determined according to the previously described method [32] . LD 50 of MERS-CoV KNIH-002 is 1 \u00d7 10 3 pfu per mouse. Five mice were inoculated with a 100-fold LD 50 (1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu) of MERS-CoV KNIH-002 strain via intranasal route, whereas three different doses (8 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg; n = 9 per dose) of the mAb (KNIH90-F1) or PBS were administered intraperitoneally on day 1 postinfection. Four mice in the group treated at the highest dose (8 mg/kg) were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal injection using a mix of 30 mg/kg Zoletil1 (Virbac, Carros, France) and 10 mg/kg Rompun1 (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) on day 4 post-infection, and lungs and brains were harvested for analysis of MERS-CoV replication. After brain and lung tissue weights were measured, tissue samples in 1 mL of DMEM media were homogenized, and MERS-CoV was titrated by plaque assay and real-time RT-PCR. To measure the virus titer, tissues were homogenized in DMEM using a manual homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min. Viral RNAs were extracted from the supernatant by Maxwell RSC Viral TNA kit (Promega) and were assayed by using PowerChek TM MERS (upE & ORF1a) Real-time RT-PCR kit (Kogene biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the standard RNA of upE, upE RT-PCR was performed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using MERS-CoV EMC as an RNA template. For PCR, 5 \u03bcl of the RT reaction was added to 20 \u03bcl of PCR amplification master mix containing Ex-Taq\u2122 polymerase (Takara, Shuzo, Japan). After PCR purification with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), 1 \u03bcl of pCR12.1-TOPO1 vector (Invitrogen) was added to the purified PCR products, and the mixture was transformed into One Shot1 Top10 competent cells (Invitrogen). The standard RNAs were synthesized massively using a MEGAscript1 T7 kit (Applied Biosystems) and the template plasmids pCR2.1-upE. The RNAs were purified by MEGAclear\u2122 kit (Applied Biosystems). RNA copy numbers were calculated based on RNA concentration and size. The upE RNA fragment was diluted serially with a 0.5 log-dilution to yield 1 to 105 copies per reaction, and these dilutions were then used as templates for rRT-PCR. Then, the Ct values of tissues and copy numbers were calculated.",

The total protein yields ranged from 1 mg/ mAb to 25 mg/mAb per 200-ml culture. Evaluation of the binding specificities of the purified IgGs by ELISA coated with soluble S-2P trimer, S1, RBD, and S2-mFc antigens revealed that six antibodies (KNIH77-A5, KNIH77-A6, KNIH90-E5, KNIH90-E6, KNIH90-F1, and KNIH90-F2) bound to S-2P trimer, S1, and RBD and were thus considered to be RBD-specific (Fig 1) .

Only KNIH90-C4 bound to prefusion S trimer more strongly than S1 protein in ELISA (Fig 1B) . Also, the specificity of mAbs were tested in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with other coronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV-2. All mAbs were specific for MERS-CoV. All mAbs showed no indication of binding to other coronavirus strains tested (S3 Fig).   Fig 1. Binding of human mAbs to S1 and RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein. Binding specificity of the mAbs was assessed by ELISA with a soluble S-2P trimer, S1, RBD sub-domains, and S2-mFc. Among the 11 purified mAbs, six were specific to RBD and five were specific to S1 (non-RBD). RBD-specific mAbs bound to both RBD and S1 protein. No S2-specific mAbs (blue line) were identified.

The RBD comprises seven \u03b1-helices (residues 385-9, 411-5, 430-5, 453-5, 463-8, 525-9, and 547-9) and 11 \u03b2strands (residues 400-4, 407-9, 419-26, 438-47, 477-83, 497-507, 513-5, 538-44, 553-61, 568-76, and 583-6). The variable-region structure model of KNIH90-F1 was generated from residues 20 to 149 of the heavy chain and residues 20 to 129 of the light chain. A 14-amino acid peptide sequence of the complementarity determining region H3 loop for KNIH90-F1 was predicted at position 124SYGSGSYYTHYYAM137 of the heavy chain (Fig 3A) . Modeled structures were used as the starting structures for docking simulation. According to the Snug-Dock protocol, these two structures were located very close to each other but did not superpose. Determination of the RBD interaction with KNIH90-F1 was performed by the SnugDock algorithm based on computational modeling of KNIH90-F1 and RBD protein sequences (Fig 3B) . SnugDock alignment indicated that the RBD N-terminus couples to the KNIH90-F1 variable region through four RBD-interfacing peptide sequences: 528SI529, 538GDYYRKQ544, 544QLSPL548, and 551GGW553. Another three individual amino acid sites (S508, D510, and W553) of the MERS-RBD molecule also aligned closely with the KNIH90-F1 variable region (Fig 3C) . The RBD residues (510D, 538GDY540, and 553W) attached to the KNIH90-F1 antibody are the same sites that interact with DPP4 [35] . The several residues (508S, 510D, 538G, 543KQLS546, 548L, 551GG552) of binding interface in KNIH90-F1 mAb were expected as novel binding resides in comparison with those of other MERS-CoV antibodies [10, 36, 37] . Five of the simulated binding-interface residues (510D, 539D, 540Y, 542R, and 553W) showed strong hindrance of RBD-hDPP4-receptor binding in the mAb m336 study [12] . These results indicated that KNIH90-F1 was capable of neutralizing MERS-CoV entry by preventing RBD attachment to DPP4. ",

Similarly, infectious viruses were hardly detected in the lungs, with a~5 log reduction as compared with the control group (Fig 5A) . However, high numbers of copies of the viral genome were detected in the lungs, indicating that the residual viral genome or non-replicable viral particles persisted (Fig 5B) . The previous report elucidated that the mice infected with MERS-CoV had shown the pathological changes, gross pathological changes, mononuclear cell infiltration and alveolar edema on day 4 and day 7 post-infection [13] , we performed euthanasia on day 4 and 7 to analyze the therapeutic or prophylactic effect of mAbs. Histopathological changes, such as inflammatory cell infiltration, neurogenic necrosis, and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration, were observed in lung and brain tissues of the untreated group, as described previously [13] . (Fig 6) . Additionally, monocyte infiltration was observed in lung tissues of both KNIH90-F1-treated and PBS-treated groups at 4-days post-infection but not in brain tissues. Inflammatory monocyte infiltration was observed in the brains of PBS-treated mice 7-days post-infection, whereas mAb-treated mice showed no apparent brain lesions. These data suggest that MERS-CoV infection induced the influx of monocytes into the lungs and brains of infected mice in a time-dependent manner.",

Since then, the importance of patient management, especially in hospitals, and preparedness against newly emerging infectious diseases has been emphasized from a public health perspective. Due to the absence of approved vaccines and virus-specific antiviral agents, an alternative antiviral-treatment guideline for MERS-CoV patients involving the triple administration of type I interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir for 10 to 14 days was recommended in South Korea [38] . However, side effects of this triple administration and significantly low therapeutic efficacy of ribavirin and interferon for severe MERS cases have been reported [39] [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, a virus-specific neutralizing antibody regimen could be proposed as an alternative treatment.",

Previous reports, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HIV and RSV, showed that structure-designed stabilization of the viral surface protein by mutations or multivalent display induced greater neutralizing mAbs than postfusion proteins [20] [21] [22] [23] . Accordingly, we reasoned that the prefusion S-2P probe could bind greater neutralizing antibodies on the surface of single B cells than wild S protein. Considering the duration from the isolation of single B cells to the purification of IgGs, we obtained total 11 mAbs rapidly within one month by using this antibody technology. All these mAbs had high specificity, bound to only the cells infected with MERS-CoV, not other coronaviruses in the IFA experiment.",

In line with other studies, the RBD-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing activity, whereas the IC 50 values from the live-virus-based assay varied widely [6-10, 12, 43] . It is speculated that RBDspecific mAbs, such as LCA60 (IC 50 = 0.110-0.279 \u03bcg/ml), MERS-GD27 (IC 50 = 0.001 \u03bcg/ml) and KNIH90-F1 (IC 50 = 0.006 \u03bcg/ml), generated directly from patient B cells repertoires are more potent and are thus more likely to neutralize wild-type viruses. However, among the S1 (non-RBD) mAbs, only KNIH90-B2 and KNIH90-B7 showed mild neutralizing ability against the live virus (failed to reach the IC 50 value). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 binds sialic acid of host cellular receptors [44] , and non-RBD mAbs targeting the NTD of S1 also show neutralizing activity [5] . We assumed that KNIH90-B2 and KNIH90-B7 could bind to NTD of S1, resulting the mild neutralization via preventing the viral attachment to the sialic acid of cellular receptors. However, no S2-specific antibody was isolated from patient PBMCs in the present study. This might be attributed to the lower immunogenicity of the S2 than the S1 domain, as is the case for the influenza virus HA2 stalk domain [45] . The practical use of antibody cocktails has been used for Ebola virus [46, 47] , hepatitis C virus [48] , and MERS-CoV [17] to prevent the emergence of escape mutants as well as enhance the neutralization breadth. We suggest that combining RBD mAbs and non-RBD mAbs, targeting multiple antigenic sites on MERS-CoV spike, need to be implemented for treating future MERS-CoV infection.",

All KNIH90-F1-treated mice survived after challenge with an extremely high dose (100 LD 50 ; 1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/mouse) of the virus, including those that received the low dose (2 mg/kg) of mAbs, reflecting the potent therapeutic efficacy of this mAb. Additionally, the residual live-virus particles were not detected in the lungs by 4-days post-infection in both the therapeutic and prophylactic administration groups. Even with a significant amount of viral genome in the lungs, MERS-CoV infection rarely occurred through plaque assays. It was estimated that the KNIH90-F1 mAb administered to the animal model remained in the tissues or attached to the virus and neutralized its infectivity. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics of mAbs, the half-life of mAbs is generally 14 days (7-21 days) [49] . We sacrificed the mice administered with KNIH90-F1 mAb on the post-infection four days. Therefore, we assumed that a sufficient amount of mAb in the lungs could block the remained MERS-CoV infection in plaque assays.",

            "text": "Despite the promise of our developed mAbs, there are several limitations of this study that should be addressed in the future. First, escape mutants are more likely to occur when cultured viruses are continuously exposed to RBD-specific antibodies [10, 15] . Because KNIH90-F1 recognizes similar RBD domains, the efficacy of combined therapy with non-RBD S1 antibodies or RBD antibodies targeting different epitopes on the RBD should be evaluated to reduce the potential for escape mutations. In addition to direct receptor inhibition, indirect Fc-receptormediated immune responses, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, should also be investigated. Second, due to the limited availability of TG mice, survival analysis following prophylactic administration was not completed. Only a pathogenic study that included measurements of viral titers in lung and brain tissues and histopathology were conducted. Therefore, additional animal experiments should be performed to assess complete prophylactic efficacy. Third, computer-assisted structural docking modeling suggested that the putative interacting residues on RBD are similar to those published previously [5, 8, 12] ; however, more precise epitope mapping, such as that utilizing X-ray crystallography or RBD point-mutation analysis, is needed to resolve the exact epitope structure.",

This approach could be promptly applied for newly emerging viruses potentially threatening public health in the future. The KNIH90-F1 mAb could represent a potential candidate for development of a novel MERS therapeutic agent, as well as a prophylactic treatment. Moreover, it could be used in combination with other mAbs targeting different RBD epitopes or non-RBD mAbs for practical MERS immunotherapy.",

Neutralization potency of the RBD-specific mAb KNIH90-F1 was evaluated by a PRNT assay using low mAb concentrations (0.00025-0.25 \u03bcg/ml). Percent inhibition by the mAb was determined by comparison with untreated cells (A). The IC 50 value was determined by nonlinear regression curve fitting (B). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and data represent the mean of each experiment with standard errors. [27] . Briefly, Vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV Erasmus (EMC) strain and SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a Korean patient [50] . MRC5 cells were infected with human coronaviruses (hCoV) OC-43 strain (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and 229E strain (ATCC). LLC-MK2 cells were infected with hCoV NL63 strain (CN061/14). After the cytopathogenic effect appeared in the infected cells, the cells were fixed with 70% methanol in PBS. Then, human anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were incubated with the Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV. As positive controls, a rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV spike protein antibody (Sino biological Inc., Beijing, China) for MERS-CoV, a mouse anti-229E coronavirus nucleoprotein OC-43 antibody (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany) for HCoV-229E, a mouse anti-coronavirus antibody, hCoV OC-43 (LifeSpan BioScience, Seattle, WA, USA) for HCoV-OC43, a rabbit polyclonal anti-hCoV-HKU1 spike protein antibody (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) for hCoV-NL63, a human serum of a Korean SARS-CoV-2 convalescent person were also incubated. The IFA performed without the positive primary antibodies (described above) were used as negative controls. The secondary antibodies, Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated goat anti-human-IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) were added to the cells and incubated. The cells were observed, and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope. (TIF)",
