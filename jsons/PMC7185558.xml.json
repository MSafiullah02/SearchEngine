In many patients, EATL is associated with celiac disease (CD), refractory or not to a gluten-free diet (GFD) [5], [6]. Yet CD is previously known in only 20\u201340% of cases [1], [4]. In half of cases, diagnosis of EATL is made during emergency surgery performed for obstruction, perforation or intestinal haemorrhage [3], [4]. Appropriate analysis of tissue specimens is often lacking in the emergency situation, thus hampering precise assessment of EATL phenotype and associated enteropathy and criteria to predict the outcome of this rare lymphoma lack specificity. In a recent study, a poor prognosis of EATL was associated with a large tumoral mass, elevated level of LDH and C reactive protein, but the presence of CD was the only predictor in multivariate analysis [7].",

Yet, it remains unknown whether the type of CD, clonal (RCDII) or non clonal including gluten-sensitive CD or RCDI, influences the outcome of EATL. Serum albumin was recently shown to be a valuable prognosis tool in RCD and may perhaps be useful to predict the outcome in EATL, inasmuch as enteropathy-related malnutrition is the most common obstacle to chemotherapy [10], [11]. Whenever chemotherapy is possible, chemoresistance is another factor which contributes to the bad prognosis of EATL. CHOP regimen has been the most widely used regimen but previous studies indicate an overall median survival of only 7 months [1], [2], [3], [4]. Except for a recent study which suggests a better prognosis of patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the efficacy of other therapeutic regimen remains poorly evaluated [12].",

Thirty-one patients (86%) received at least one cycle of chemotherapy and 14 patients (38%) were treated by several lines. Five patients could not receive any chemotherapy due to uncontrolled gastrointestinal haemorrhage, post-operative cardiopulmonary arrest, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Number of patients treated by several lines of chemotherapy (\u22652) was lower in patients with EATL and RCDII (26%) than in patients with EATL and gluten free diet-responsive CD or RCDI (56%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Chemotherapy was based on anthracycline-containing regimen (n\n = 20; 54%) mainly CHOP or on cytarabin and/or etopeside-containing treatment (n\n = 20; 54%) (Table 3\nand Supplementary Table II). Allogeneic (allo-SCT) and autologous (ASCT) stem cell transplantation after intensification were performed in three and two patients respectively. Two out the three patients treated by intensification and allo-SCT were still alive at the latest follow-up (patients 2 and 14). One patient was treated by palliative radiotherapy for relapsing skin lesions of EATL.",

In univariate analysis, the type of CD, serum albumin levels, realization of at least one cycle of chemotherapy and more surprisingly surgical tumour resection were predictors for overall survival (Fig. 3). Neither disease stage (localized versus disseminated) nor type of lymphoma (pleomorphic versus anaplastic) did predict overall survival. In multivariate analysis, serum albumin level > 21.6 g/L, treatment with at least one cycle of chemotherapy and reductive surgery remained good prognostic factors (Fig. 3).",

In the present study, all EATL were associated with CD, composed of pleomorphic cells and/or contained some large or anaplastic-like lymphoma cells strongly positive for CD30. None of them expressed CD56. They may thus be classified as EATL type I [23], [25]. Whether the lack of CD56 is characteristic for type I EATL is unclear. A recent study reported that up to 30% of type I EATL had detectable expression of this natural killer marker on paraffin sections [7]. Interestingly, CD56 was detected by flow cytometry in 40\u201350% of abnormal IEL in two RCDII patients but not in the corresponding lymphomas. It is thus not excluded that some lymphoma cells express low level of CD56 not detectable by immunohistochemistry. Confirming previous studies, we observed that most CD-associated EATL expressed the IEL-specific integrin CD103 [5], [26], [27]. As previously suggested, this characteristic as well as the clonal filiation between RCDII IEL and EATL demonstrated herein in 9 cases by analysis of TCR\u03b3 chain rearrangement points to their origin from the IEL compartment [5], [26]. CD103 was however not detected in two cases of EATL that developed in skin and mesenteric lymph nodes of RCDII patients respectively. Since the same clonal TCR\u03b3 rearrangement was detected in RCDII IEL and in EATL in both patients, loss of CD103 may result either from the lack of an inductive signal away from the gut or more likely from dedifferentiation during transformation.",

These data point out to the epitheliotropism of RCDII and EATL cells that may be favoured by CD103 binding to E-cadherin expressed by skin and gut epithelial cells [28]. In some cases, pathological diagnosis of EATL was particularly arduous due to the lack of massive infiltration and tumour cells had to be tracked by their abnormal cytology and CD30 expression in mesenteric lymph nodes or along the intestinal wall. This was notably the case in patient 32 in whom regular follow-up by Pet-scan allowed to detect enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, in which immuno-histochemistry demonstrated the presence of RCDII IEL but also of small clusters of large lymphoma cells. Finally, it may be noted that Pet-scan was particularly useful for EATL diagnosis [29] and allowed localization of the tumour in 86% of cases whatever the type of CD.",

Thus, univariate analysis revealed a striking difference in the prognosis of EATL depending on its association with clonal or non clonal CD. The five-year survival rate was almost 60% for EATL associated with gluten-free diet responsive CD or RCDI but 0% in cases associated with RCDII. One explanation may lie on the fact that clonal RCDII IEL are already engaged in malignant transformation [9], [30]. RCDII IEL are however non proliferative cells and thus difficult to eradicate by regular chemotherapy. They may represent a reservoir of cells susceptible to more aggressive transformation [9]. A second non exclusive hypothesis is the severe malnutrition often associated with RCDII. Yet low serum albumin levels indicative of protein-losing enteropathy, a condition significantly associated with RCDII [9] and severe malnutrition, also had a very poor prognosis value. Furthermore the prognostic value of low serum albumin levels persisted but not that of RCDII in multivariate analysis (Fig. 3), suggesting that malnutrition is central in the poor prognosis associated with RCDII. Altogether these data stress the need to provide nutritional support and to treat the enteropathy as early as possible to improve tolerance to chemotherapy and increase overall survival.",

Despite the heterogeneity in chemotherapy regimens, it was possible to observe a higher survival rate in patients who had surgical resection and chemotherapy. The benefit of tumour reduction surgery might be surprising as generally not considered as the first choice treatment of lymphoma [31]. Yet our observation of a very significant positive impact of debulking surgery on overall survival rate independently of nutritional status should encourage a more systematic recourse to elective surgery, as already advocated in some cases of metastatic solid tumours [32], [33]. Five patients received an intensive regimen of chemotherapy followed by ASCT or allo-SCT and had a median survival of 10\u201350 months. These data are in keeping with a recent Scottish study showing that high dosage IVE/MTX chemotherapy followed by ASCT regimen resulted in better survival than anthracycline-based chemotherapy [12]. In the later study, patients treated by both chemotherapy and surgery also had a better prognosis. Surgery may avoid complications of chemotherapy such as haemorrhage or peritonitis due to tumour necrosis. Timing for surgery needs however to be defined.",
