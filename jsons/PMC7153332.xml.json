Stormwater is a kind of raw water formed by natural contamination of pollutants in rain catchment areas like agricultural field, pond, and forest, etc. Other examples of raw water are groundwater abstracted through borehole, rivers, natural and man-made lakes, and reservoirs (Scholz, 2006). The raw water can be supplied for potable use after simple filtration steps and disinfection. After domestic or industrial usage, water is discharged in sewage system. This water, burdened with pollutants and pathogenic microbes, is called as wastewater. Domestic wastewater is categorized as greywater and blackwater. Former is generated from kitchen, laundry, and washrooms, while latter includes human excreta, i.e., feces and urine discharged from toilets. Well-engineered wastewater treatment plant and zero-energy constructed wetlands are employed to treat domestic wastewater so water can be discharged back to waterbodies (Lewandowski and Boltz, 2010).",

Current knowledge of indigenous microorganism in drinking water treatment arose 50 years back by several studies done on presence and impact of benign microbial population on filters. First trickling filter was installed in 1922 in Madison, Wisconsin, for large water treatment system. Understanding the microbial community of filter and their role in water treatment is a continuing process, assisted with advent of advance tools for the analysis of microbial diversity and increased understanding of microbial growth in oligotrophic condition and the consideration of potable water as a complex ecosystem (Bureau, 2016, Daigger and Boltz, 2011, Lewandowski and Boltz, 2010 of safe drinking water).",

Essentially an SSF is composed of following vertically arranged layers of components. Topmost layer is the supernatant water which is subjected for filtration. Water column provides enough hydrostatic pressure for its percolation through filtration system. Second is a thick layer of actual filtration medium that is of fine sand (effective size 0.15\u20130.3 mm). It is a low-cost durable medium for filtration. Because of its smaller particle size (0.15\u20130.3 mm) fine sand provides large surface area for filtration as well as for the formation of biofilm, however its small voids size decreases flow rate (0.1\u20130.3 m/h) through SSF. Topmost portion of sand is enriched with microbial growth because of better availability of oxygen as compared to lower portion. Most of the decontamination occurs in this active biological layer, also called as schmutzdecke. Microbes form of biofilm on inert sand particles and aid the biofiltration process. Bottom to sand is a layer of gravel which provides free passage to treated water to exit the bed. Gravel supports sand bed and prevents exit hose pipe from clogging. Usually the four layers make up 1 m thick column of the biofilter.",

Intermittently scrapping of\nschmutzdecke is essential because its overgrowth blocks percolation process. A gap period of ripening of schmutzdecke follows the scrapping to achieve a fully active SSF. A well-developed schmutzdecke is necessary for pathogen removal. Schmutzdecke is primary contributor to the filtration process while secondary contributors are microbes attached to sand particle in deeper part of SSF (Verma et al., 2017).",

Slow percolation facilitates enough time for interaction of pathogens with biofilm present on sand particle. Predation is the main activity in mature biofilm responsible for removal and inactivation. For example, bacteria removal in SSF has been attributed to grazing by protozoa and worms. Grazing of adsorbed bacteria in biofilm frees the site for further retention of incoming bacteria. E. coli population in the treated water was found to be negatively correlated with the diversity and size flagellate and ciliate populations in the filter which signifies the importance of protozoa in bacteria removal. Meiofaunal species (0.1\u20131 mm in size) also predates on individual bacterial or algal cells, suspended particles, or other species. Adsorption on sticky biofilm assists the removal of biological particles in deeper region. Moreover, natural death, inactivation, and metabolic breakdown (i.e., reduction of organic carbon) also predominate in lower part (Guchi, 2015).\n",

            "text": "Rapid sand filter (RSF) evolved at end of 19th century in the United States of America. It became popular in 1920s because it required lesser necessary facilities with respect to SSF. Unlike slow sand filters, RSF involves only physical process because of absence of biological layer (biofilm) on filter media. Coarse-grained sand and gravels efficiently remove suspended solid by straining and adsorption. RSF must be aided with pretreatment (sedimentation and flocculation) and posttreatment (disinfection) steps to remove pathogens and prevent fouling. It requires lesser area for construction as compared to SSF for treatment of unit volume of water. RSF is constructed in a rectangular tank usually made up of concrete. Three to five layers of graded gravel are installed at the bottom of tank over a network of drainage pipes placed on the floor. Filter media that is coarse sand with a diameter ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mm is filled over gravel layer. As coarse sand provides larger void as compared with fine sand of SSF, RSF achieves a higher rate of filtration. Gravel layer prevents sand from being drained out during filtration. Also, it facilitates even distribution of water through filtration media during backwash. Top of the RSF is either open for supernatant water (gravity filter) or closed (pressure filter) (O'Connor and O'Connor, 2002).\n",

Prominent biological particles retained by RSF include algal microcolonies (5\u201320 \u03bcm), protozoan cysts (3\u201310 \u03bcm), bacterial cells (0.2\u20132 \u03bcm), and virus particles (0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcm). Rose (1988) reported removal of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The deposition of microorganisms and other particles in filters depends on transportation efficiency and retention in surface pore of filter media. Theoretical model for collection of microorganism on anthracite and sand media suggested lowest removal of individual bacterial cells in comparison to free suspended viruses, protozoa, or microbial aggregates and other particulates. In fact, removal of nanoscale particles such as viruses is governed by diffusion while protozoans are removed by cumulative effect of sedimentation and interception. Removal mechanism for suspended bacterial cells involves diffusion, differential sedimentation, and interception. Effective grain size is an important factor of collection of viruses and bacteria on media surface, whereas removal of protozoa and microbial aggregates is chiefly influenced by hydraulic loading rates. Therefore, the model suggests that smaller grain size media is major factor for removal of freely suspended viruses and other nanosized particles, and lower hydraulic loading rates would be improving removal efficacy for protozoan pathogens. Other factors that were not included in the model such as net surface charge on the filter media and microbial surfaces; media properties (type, size, and depth); hydraulic loading rates; upstream chemical use (oxidants and/or coagulants); water quality variables; flow control; and backwashing and postbackwashing practices may also significantly influence pathogen removal efficiency of filter media. Additional factors such as pH, ionic strength, temperature of effluent; concentration, molecular size, and charge density of dissolved organics; and particle characteristics influence removal efficiency. For example, high ionic strength reduces the electric double layer around microorganisms and filter media, thereby increasing attachment efficiency between the two. Backwashing of filter media in RSF may release pathogen from RSF granules. Pathogen removal in water treatment system was observed in many experimental studies. Removal of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts was shown to be affected by extent of filter maturation and application of coagulant chemicals. Treatment of coagulated primary effluent through RSF demonstrated approximately 1 log unit decrease in fecal coliform, pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and enteroviruses, 50%\u201380% of protozoan (Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica) cysts, and 90%\u201399% of helminth ova (Adelman et al., 2012, Hoslett et al., 2018, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2009).",

Studies performed on 358 biofilters including 89 designs with SZs and 269 designs without SZs were compiled to compare log removal of E. coli (EC), fecal coliforms (FC), and enterococci (ENT) in laboratory mesocosm and in field conditions. Stormwater monitoring usually focuses these three groups of bacteria as indicator of pathogen load (Table 7.3\n). Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) includes Klebsiella and Escherichia genera. EC is a subgroup of FC that comprises both nonpathogenic and pathogenic members and ENT include 36 species of Gram-positive diplococcoid bacteria, some of which are human pathogens. FIB is taken as proxy for pathogen load in stormwater. Pathogens exhibit high infectivity even at their low abundance in water. Low abundance poses difficulty in detection; hence proxy like FIB is essential. FIB concentration in stormwater remains high, sometimes several order higher than standards for potable and recreational purpose of water. FIB contamination in stormwater occurs by human fecal (sewage), nonfecal, and animal sources. It poses serious challenge for public health and therefore to stormwater management system like biofilter. Average FIB removal efficiency of biofilter with SZ was higher (approximately eightfold) than the one without SZ (Peng et al., 2016).",

Traditional filtration media, represented by a mixture of fine and coarse sand, compost, and an overlying layer of mulch, shows poor microbe removal ability under field conditions despite sufficient hydraulic conductivity, good removal efficiencies for many pollutants, and acceptable support for vegetative growth. Many reasons might be responsible for poor efficiency such as operating conditions, maintenance issue including clogging and short circuiting, overloading of stormwater, and microbial regrowth. Laboratory-scale sand biofilters removed indicator bacteria in range of 0.45 log10 \u2013 0.5 log10. Log10 removal capacity for protozoan indicator (C. perfringens) and viral indicators (F-RNA coliphages) was 3.2 and 3.9, respectively, as reported in another study.

High surface area and exceptional sorption capacity make GAC a better medium for contaminant removal. GAC-amended biofilters facilitate microbial growth and potentiate leaching in the course of intermittent flow, thereby encouraging formation of biofilm in pore spaces on the collector grains. Moreover, biofilm adds further heterogeneity to the surface which may influence infiltration by altering hydrodynamics of the flow through the porous media. Extracellular polymeric substances secreted on biofilm alter roughness, hydrophobicity, and electrokinetic properties of the collector surface. Another geomedia studied for amendment is zeolite. Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as adsorbent because of its exceptional sorption and ion-exchange characteristics. It is an effective adsorbent for chemical compounds owing to high specific surface area of porous surface. Nevertheless, zeolite is useful for microbial removal. Zeolite-modified stormwater biofilter studies explored the effect of zeolite particle size, surface modification, and the presence of vegetation on E. coli removal. Another common amendment for sand media is biochar. Similar to GAC, biochar is prepared by pyrolysis of organic material under oxygen-limited condition. Unlike GAC, preactivation of biochar is not necessary for its use. Physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and adsorption characteristics of biochar depend on variable of preparation method, e.g., feedstock, pyrolysis duration, and temperature, etc. Biochar modified sand show reduction of the remobilization of E. coli under intermittent flow conditions. Smaller particle sizes are better for E. coli removal. Physically weathered (by wet\u2013dry or freeze\u2013thaw cycles) biochar-amended biofilter exhibited improved E. coli removal capacity. Despite of abovementioned three amendments, expanded shale and red cedar wood chips (RC) have also been applied with sand media.

It is a low-cost wastewater treatment system suitable for developing countries, especially rural area. It is a natural engineered system referring to a passive engineered wastewater treatment system in which traditional vermicomposting system is inoculated with potentials of earthworms. Earthworms and microorganisms function symbiotically to remove pollutant and pathogen from wastewater. Different kinds of pollutant removal processes, that is, sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, precipitation, volatilization, and uptake by earthworm and microbe, occur in MEE. Primarily, microorganisms are responsible for biochemical degradation of pollutants, while earthworms regulate microbial population and activity. The latter degrade and homogenize ingested material by muscular actions of their foregut and add mucus to it. Thus, the activity of earthworm conditioning of the filter media results in improved microbiological activity. Besides, earthworms regulate microbial biomass directly and/or indirectly via three main mechanisms: comminution, burrowing, and casting; grazing; and dispersal (Samal et al., 2017). Of the various filter media (river bed material, wood coal, glass balls, and mud balls) evaluated for performance of MEEs, river bed material showed the best activity for removal of pollutants and pathogens. Pathogen removal efficiency of MEE was studied at a pilot scale for treatment of domestic wastewater (Arora et al., 2014a, Arora et al., 2014b). A 4-month study revealed that MEEs could proficiently remove BOD, COD along with total coliform, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and other pathogens. In addition, study also suggested that antibacterial activity of the isolated microorganisms might be responsible for the removal of pathogens. Another pilot-scale study found that MEE is dominated byProteobacteria. However, major turnover of microbial biomass was chiefly affected by earthworm-associated bacterial groups including \u03b3-Proteobacteria, Bdellovibrio, Lysobacter, and Myxococcales. Sinha et al. (2012) also reported pathogen removal in a small-scale plant for treatment of toxic wastewaters from the petroleum industry.",

River bed material was found best as compared with other natural filter media (wood coal, glass balls, mud balls, slag\u2013coal cinder ceramsite, and quartz sand) for pathogen removal through MEE (Xing et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2015). This filter media showed maximum removal of pathogen such as total coliform, fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, and E. coli. Arora et al., 2014a, Arora et al., 2014b also reported river bed material as the best media for removal of the aforementioned pathogens.",

Based on the solid media, source of wastewater and flow rate biofilter can be slow sand filter, RSF, MEE, etc. Indigenous, oligotrophic microbes of biofilm pose competition to pathogen, release antimicrobial agents, feed on pathogen, and assist in transportation and filtration processes. Variation of biofilter with additional macrofauna like earthworm and/or plants further improves removal efficiency of indicator organisms. Solid sand filter, RSF, MEE, and stormwater biofilter were able to efficiently remove indicator organisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, E. coli, total coliform, and fecal coliform, etc. Application of synthetic and natural biodegradable filter media, analysis of indigenous flora and fauna of biofilter, and optimization of operating condition are the areas of current research in this field.",
