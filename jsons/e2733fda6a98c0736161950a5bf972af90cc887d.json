            "text": "\u03b2-Ga2O3 is a highly promising semiconductor for a deep ultraviolet emitter owing to its wide bandgap, which significantly varies in the range of 4.49 eV to 4.74 eV due to its optical trirefringence in the monoclinic crystal structure (C2h). However, dominant photoluminescence (PL) emissions in \u03b2-Ga2O3 occur far below the bandgap, where the underlying PL mechanism has been under intense debate. In order to address this issue, we monitored the most intense PL peaks at 3.0 eV and 3.5 eV at room temperature by employing both linear and nonlinear absorption spectroscopy. The PL of \u03b2-Ga2O3 was found to be highly polarized along the (102) direction regardless of input polarization, and to be essentially the same for one-photon absorption (1PA), two-photon absorption (2PA), and three-photon absorption (3PA). However, absorption polarization dependence is quite distinct for 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA, as theoretically explained by optical selection rules for C2h symmetry. Based on the input-output method, 2PA and 3PA coefficients were determined to be = 3.45 cm GW -1 and = 0.013 cm 3 GW -2 at the excitation wavelength of 460 nm and 550 nm, respectively. These values are several times higher than theoretical values predicted by two-band models, indicating that \u03b2-Ga2O3 possesses strong optical nonlinearity with high polarization contrast. The absorption power dependences for 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA indicate that optical excitation is essentially excitonic, but bound to Ga vacancies (3.0 eV) and O vacancies (3.5 eV), which is different from the so-called self-trapped exciton based on the polaron model. Our main thesis is also clearly supported by the dependence of the PL shape on the excitation depth as probed by 2PA depth scan. This implies that densities for the Ga vacancy and the O vacancy vary differently as a function of depth from the excitation surface. A broad set of highly asymmetric optical properties clarified in our work is critical for the understanding of this wide-gap semiconductor and its potential use for ultraviolet sources especially when band-edge emission is realized.",

            "text": "Among other polymorphs of Ga2O3, \u03b2-Ga2O3 is most stable and crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal structure (C2h), having a wide but highly asymmetric bandgap in the range from 4.49 eV to 4.74 eV. [1, 2] This wide-gap semiconducting material has attracted much attention for applications in the field of catalysis, gas sensor, and power electronic devices, as well as for optoelectronic devices in the deep ultraviolet (UV) region, since it has the much wider bandgap than GaN (3.4 eV) and ZnO (3.37 eV). [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In addition, the availability of Ga2O3-Al2O3 alloys [(AlxGa1-x)2O3] can make this material a potential candidate for even deeper ultraviolet (wavelength: \uf06c < 220 nm) solid-state light source that can be used to effectively break or disinfect airborne viruses, such as swine influenza virus H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). [8, 9] Along with its wide bandgap, the availability of high-quality single crystalline substrates and controllable n-type doping have made \u03b2-Ga2O3 a promising material for next-generation power electronic devices. From the perspective of optoelectronic and photonic applications, key optical properties of this material must be understood, which include absorption and emission characteristics in the realm of linear and nonlinear light-matter interactions as a function of excitation wavelength and polarization. Intriguingly, upon optical excitation along the widest bandgap direction of \u03b2-Ga2O3, the photoluminescence (PL) emission is typically dictated not by band-edge emission (~ 4.74 eV), but by below-gap transitions in UVA (~3.5 eV) and blue (~3.0 eV) regions. [10, 11] Based on density functional calculations, depth-resolved cathodoluminescence (DRCL) spectroscopy, ellipsometry and other methods, several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the UVA/blue emissions of \u03b2-Ga2O3, including extrinsic defects such as Ga and/or O vacancies, [7, [12] [13] [14] [15] and intrinsic self-trapped holes (polarons), [10, [16] [17] [18] but the issue still remains controversial. Obviously, understanding of these transitions and their relationship with emission mechanisms is crucial for Ga2O3-based photonic devices toward the even deeper UV range. Also, precise understanding of its nonlinear optical properties is important for assessing \u03b2-Ga2O3 for novel UV nonlinear optical applications. Although \u03b2-Ga2O3 was known to be luminescent under multiphoton excitation, [19] there is no report on the precise quantification of its nonlinear optical properties.",

            "text": "In order to study the basic properties of the below-gap PL, we carried out a series of optical measurements on a ( 2 \u0305 1 )-oriented \u03b2-Ga2O3 single crystal by employing the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy over a broad wavelength range (\uf06c = 220 nm-550 nm). This range covers from linear one-photon absorption (1PA) to nonlinear twophoton absorption (2PA) and even to three-photon absorption (3PA). Regardless of excitation order (1PA, 2PA, or 3PA) and input polarization, our sample exhibited typical UVA/blue PL emissions, being highly polarized along the (102) direction. The origin for the highly polarized PL is likely related to the highly anisotropic valence band. [14] We also probed the absorption polarization dependences of 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA of \u03b2-Ga2O3, which show very different optical selection rules in accordance with the C2h crystal symmetry. [20] [21] [22] [23] Furthermore, we measured the absolute values of 2PA and 3PA coefficients of \u03b2-Ga2O3 when the input polarization was along the (102) direction. The measured values can be explained by the two-band models, [24] but with about 5 times larger scaling constants owing to its unique band structure. This observation demonstrates that \u03b2-Ga2O3 has very large optical nonlinearity in spite of its wide bandgap. Nonlinear depth scan was also performed to study the below-gap PL as a function of excitation depth. The drastically varying PL feature clearly shows that the nature of PL is not intrinsic, but extrinsic involving Ga vacancies (VGa) and O vacancies (VO) for the blue and UVA emissions, respectively, which is consistent with the recent DRCL results. [12] We further concluded that these transitions arise most likely from radiative recombination of excitons bound to V Ga and V O , based upon both linear and nonlinear absorption power dependences. In fact, the feasibility of a room-temperature-stable exciton with a large binding energy up to 230 meV was theoretically proposed in this semiconductor. [1] Our comprehensive results imply that \u03b2-Ga2O3 is not only a promising UV nonlinear optical material with a drastic polarization control but also a deep-UV emitter, especially when the high-quality synthesis is assured for minimizing the extrinsic defects in order to trigger the band-edge emission. Figure 1a shows the monoclinic crystal structure of \u03b2-Ga2O3, together with our excitation geometry specified, where the propagation direction of the laser beam is along the (2 \u0305 0 ) direction of \u03b2-Ga2O3. In order to compare with 1PA, the beam focus for 2PA and 3PA was properly chosen to maximize surface excitation. Figure 1b Figure S1 ). In view of the extrinsic defect model, the peak near 350 nm (3.5eV) arises from optical transition associated with VO levels and the peak near 405 nm (3.0 eV) with VGa levels. [16, 25, 26] Based on the overlaid PL spectra ( Figure S2 ), we concluded that the PL shape does not depend on the excitation order, except for more pronounced VO transition with increasing excitation order (1PA\u21922PA\u21923PA). As explained later, this effect arises from a partial contribution from volume excitation, which is typical of nonlinear optical absorption, whereas 1PA is essentially surface excitation. Also, a minor wavy feature in the range of 360 nm-380 nm in the 3PAinduced PL turned out to be an artifact when using the short-pass filters employed for 3PA to block the excitation beam. Our results therefore show that the PL is dictated by the below-gap transitions regardless of 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA. We also found that the spectral feature of the PL does not change when \u03b5 = ( , , ) was set to parallel to the (010) direction, which is orthogonal to (102). All of these results imply that there are no other hidden levels specifically active to nonlinear optical 2PA or 3PA and that the characteristic of the PL does not depend on the input polarization but on the symmetry of the VO and VGa transitions towards the valence band.",

Although defectinduced PL is typically unpolarized, it can attain certain polarization if the levels associated with the transition are anisotropic in k space.

Clearly, eq. 7 is valid only within the 2PA band (1/2 < < 1) and the absolute magnitude of the value is determined by an overall scaling factor , which is about 1940 in units such that is in cm GW -1 in the two-band model.

One of the advantages of 2PA method is the ability to measure the depth-dependent profile by controlling the focus inside the sample. [38] Recently, the variation of the PL shape was demonstrated using DRCL spectroscopy in support of the extrinsic nature for the below-gap PL. Figure 6a shows Figure 6b ). When the beam focus is precisely at the surface of the sample, both bulk and surface contributions coexist (intermediate excitation in Figure   6c ). If the sample is outside the Rayleigh range, 2PA occurs predominantly at the surface with a negligible bulk contribution (surface excitation in Figure 6d ). We emphasize that results in Figure 6 cannot be explained by the polaron picture that should exhibit an intrinsic depthindependent PL. In fact, our 2PA depth scan is consistent with the recent DRCL results. [12] Our observation shows that the origin of the below-gap PL is the extrinsic VGa and VO levels that have different density distributions from the surface to the interior of the sample. We note here that a non-uniform compensation in Sn-doped \u03b2-Ga2O3 was reported recently, [39] in which stronger compensation of the donor (Sn) near the surface was observed, compared to the inside of the sample. The suspected candidate for this non-uniform compensation was also attributed to the stronger contribution of VGa near the surface. Our result further provides a clear experimental evidence of the existence of non-uniform distribution of V Ga and V O from the surface, which can be a crucial determination factor for the realization of highly conductive ntype and p-type Ga2O3.",

Along with conventional 1PA, we showed that this wide-gap semiconductor can be nonlinearly excited by 2PA and 3PA, in which optical excitation relaxes predominantly into the ground state via defect-induced PL at 3.0 eV and 3.5 eV. The absorption power dependence and 2PA depth scan clearly show that these below-gap transitions arise essentially from radiative recombination of excitons bound to V Ga and V O sites, respectively. The strong non-uniform distribution of VGa and VO sites from the sample surface to the inside of the sample was observed, which can explain the recently reported stronger compensation of the donor near the surface. We showed that the VGa PL and the VO PL are highly polarized along the (102) direction of \u03b2-Ga2O3 regardless of the excitation order. The absorption polarization dependences were also measured to be highly polarized for 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA, respectively, which are quite distinct for each excitation order. The observed absorption polarization dependences were explained theoretically based on optical selection rules for the monoclinic crystal structure. We used the input-output method to determine the 2PA coefficient = 3.45 cm GW -1 at \u03bb = 461 nm and the 3PA coefficient = 0.013 cm 3 GW -2 at \u03bb = 551 nm, respectively. It turned out that this wide-gap semiconductor possesses at least five times higher nonlinearity when compared with typical two-band models. The excellent nonlinearity of \u03b2-Ga2O3 stems from its highly anisotropic band structure. Our series of important results imply that this wide-gap semiconductor is not only a highly promising UV nonlinear absorber with high polarization contrast, but also a UV light emitter especially when defect control is ensured for the band-edge emission.",

In this direction, the bandgap is in the range of 4.5 eV-4.6 eV, and therefore, our choice of excitation wavelengths is within the range for 1PA (\u03bb = 241 nm), 2PA (\u03bb = 291 nm), and 3PA (\u03bb = 551 nm), respectively. In fact, we confirmed the corresponding excitation order (p) based upon the absorption power dependence: PL counts \u221d , where I is the input intensity of the incident laser and p = 1.0, 1.5-2.2, and 3.3 for 1PA, 2PA, and 3PA, respectively (",

The theoretical calculations for the 2PA and 3PA selection rules are much more complicated as they are nonlinear optical processes and details are described in S4 and S5.We further determined the 2PA coefficient ( ) and the 3PA coefficient ( ) by monitoring the nonlinear absorbance of the input beam by the \u03b2-Ga2O3 crystal as a function of input intensity, when \u03b5 = ( , , ) was set to parallel to the (102) direction in order to ensure maximum nonlinear absorption(Figure 3c,d). In our experiment, we varied the input intensity( ) by adjusting the angle ( ) of the step-variable ND filter while the input polarization of the excitation laser remained the same. The pink and blue dots in Figure 4 correspond to the input intensity ( ) vs. output intensity ( ) for (a) 2PA at \u03bb = 461 nm and (b) 3PA at \u03bb = 550 nm, respectively.

Firstly, the critical exponent of p = 1 at the bandgap (~4.74 eV) clearly indicates that transition is basically excitonic, but involving the extrinsic VO and VGa levels. The same power exponent persists up to ~275 nm, but suddenly increases to 1.4 near 280 nm and further to 1.6 around 300 nm. This intriguing feature can be explained by the subgap 1PA via a significant Urbach tailing of the direct gap to 275 nm (~4.5 eV) and the coexistence of the subgap 1PA and 2PA thereafter, which explains the non-integer exponent in the range of 1 < p < 2. This indicates that subgap 1PA is only significant within the Urbach tailing range (4.5 eV-4.74 eV). In other words, if this subgap transition is exclusively due to the presence of the self-trapped state, 1PA should persist all the way down to 1.1 eV below the bandgap (3,66 eV-4.74 eV). Moreover, we experimentally confirmed that the subgap 1PA is as efficient as typical band-to-band transition. This also excludes the possibility of the role of the indirect gap as indirect transition is much more inefficient. Moreover, a theoretically predicted indirect gap is only 30 meV-40 meV below the bandgap. Therefore, our powerdependent PLE results show that the subgap transition arises essentially from the Urbach tailing effect.",
