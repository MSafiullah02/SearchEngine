During the Asian flu in 1957 it was reported that the use of Mandl\u2019s paint seemed to prevent the development of influenza. In the untreated group 14% developed influenza, this against 2,8% in the treated group. Furthermore, in already developed influenza, starting iodine after three days of illness reduced the number of cases significantly compared to the control group, the effect being clear after only two days of treatment [2].",

In 2013 it was shown in newborn lambs inoculated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that iodine treatment resulted in less lung lesions and less pulmonary expression of RSV antigen. Also, in 3-week-old lambs it was demonstrated that iodine supplementation reduced the severity of RSV-infection [3]. Finally, epidemiological data show that in the current COVID-19 pandemic the Japanese, known for their high iodine intake, have a very low number of COVID-19 deaths compared to other countries, despite the fact that Japan has the eldest population of the world and the national lockdown has thus far been one of mild measures [6], [7].",

Besides it should be borne in mind that iodine deficiency is estimated to affect one third of the world population at the moment.",
