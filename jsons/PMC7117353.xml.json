Infectious and non-infectious factors can be involved in diarrhea outbreaks in suckling piglets. Among non-infectious factors stress, poor husbandry and nutrition can contribute to an animal's susceptibility to disease. Moreover, enteric outbreaks are usually associated to the presence of infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria or coccidian, although the presence of pathogens in piglets alone does not determine the occurrence of diarrhea episodes (Ruiz et al., 2016). All those pathogens can act as primary and sole agents of scours in piglets although co-infections are commonly reported (Kongsted et al., 2018; Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018).",

Regarding the positive samples to TGEV in the present study it must be mentioned that the PCR that we used could not distinguish TGEV from porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) since the target gene was the viral nucleocapside. Besides this, the spread of PRCV across Europe since its emergence in the 1980 decade reduced the prevalence of TGEV because of the crossed immunity between the two viruses. Nowadays diarrhea caused by TGEV is uncommon in Europe (Saif et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The prevalence of C. perfringens type A, as well as the Cp\u03b22 positive strains, was very high and similar between diarrheic and healthy pigs. The role of the cp\u03b22 toxin in the pathogenesis of neonatal diarrhea is controversial and while some studies have associated it with diarrhea outbreaks (Garmory et al., 2000; Bueschel et al., 2003), others found no differences between diseased and healthy pigs (J\u00e4ggi et al., 2009; Farzan et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014). Since C. perfringens type A is a common gut microorganism, the detection of this agent cannot be interpreted unambiguously, given that it is not possible to distinguish commensal from pathogenic strains. Thus, although it has been considered as a main pathogen involved in persistent neonatal diarrhea (Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018), a direct pathogen-toxin-disease association has not been yet determined (Kongsted et al., 2013, Kongsted et al., 2018). As regards C. perfringens type C, the prevalence detected in the present study was low. This could be the result of the routine vaccination plan implemented in sows (Salvarani et al., 2013).",

In the present study, ETEC strains were infrequently isolated from both diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets, similar to the results reported previously by others (Kongsted et al., 2013; Kongsted et al., 2018; Larsson et al., 2015; Mesonero-Escuredo et al., 2018). This low prevalence of E. coli pathotypes and virulent factors is probably related to the E. coli vaccination programs implemented in sows in the Spanish farms. Most of these vaccines available on the market contain E. coli fimbriae (mostly F4, F5, F6 and F41) and toxoids (such as LT), and therefore, prevent the infection caused by pathogenic strains of E. coli. By contrast, EAST1 positive E. coli were very common. The pathogenic role of the EAST1 toxin is not clear, given that it has also been found in a high prevalence in strains from healthy animals of our study in agreement with the results published by Zajacova et al. (2012).Nevertheless, in some farms in which RVA was not considered to be the main causative agent, the diarrheic process of the piglets could be associated to pathogenic E. coli or toxigenic C. difficile strains.",
