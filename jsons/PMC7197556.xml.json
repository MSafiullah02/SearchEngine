The patients received routine comprehensive treatments including intravenous antibiotics, assisted oxygenation, specific treatment for the underlying diseases, and supportive treatments. In addition, 11 patients had glucocorticoid therapy during the course of their hospitalization (not known in 3 patients). The major complications leading to patient demise were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart and respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failures.

A number of potential mechanisms may have been involved. First, SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via CD13 or CD66a directly or through development of auto-antibodies or immune complexes, as seen in SARS [8]. Atrophy of bone marrow hematopoietic tissue has been seen in SARS and COVID-19 [9, 10]. Second, glucocorticoid treatment can induce lymphocytopenia in some patients [8]. Interestingly, case 14 had no fever during her stay in the hospital. The CBC profile from the first day postop showed high WBC counts and lymphocytopenia before the positive CT and nuclear acid test, suggesting that this CBC profile may serve as a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Third, as seen in another study of ours [11], superimposed bacterial infection can be seen a portion of patients, which can lead to elevation of WBC.",

            "text": "Homeostasis and a normal immune system are critical in controlling acute viral infection. By dynamically screening 14 cytokines/chemokines in blood, Jiang et al. found that levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20131 increased in the patients with superinfection, and the mRNAs for these cytokines were also increased in lung tissues [12]. These observations suggest that elevation of these cytokines/chemokines is a sign of superinfection and may be related to a high risk for death [12]. Complement is also a major component of innate immunity. In a mouse model, mice deficient in complement C3 had less weight loss and reduced pathology, improved respiratory function, and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lung and peripheral blood after SARS-CoV infection, as compared with wild-type mice [13]. Therefore, it is suggested that inhibiting complement signaling may serve as a strategy for immune therapy. Other theories suggest that lack of antiviral cytokine response such as interferon alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and interleukin 12p40 may represent a mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV [14]. The elevated IL-6 and a component of complement C1q in our study suggest that innate immunity play an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dynamic screening of the level of these cytokines and component of the complement system will be helpful for evaluating prognosis and clinical treatment.",

            "text": "Another important player in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which has been recognized as the functional receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [5, 7, 15]. ACE2 mRNA and protein are known to be present in virtually all organs (respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) [15]. The surface expression of ACE2 protein in alveolar epithelial cells and gastrointestinal epithelial cells provides the route of viral entry [16]. These routes are also related to symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. We suspect that there are higher densities of ACE2 in lung alveolar epithelial cells in male patients than in female patients, which may be the underlying reason for higher morbidity in males. In addition, elevated fasting blood glucose, GGT, and LDH can be closely related to impairment of the microenvironment of the infected tissue and the damage to target cells such as beta cells in the islets, biliary epithelial cells in the liver, and myocardium cells in the heart through ACE2 and the subsequent disruption of different feedback loops [17, 18]. The presence of ACE2 in bone morrow tissue can be one of the causes of the hematological changes described above. SARS-CoV-2 may also aggravate the condition of patients with hypertension through the ACE2 in human vascular endothelia and lead to a worse prognosis [16].",
