In an effort to ameliorate this devastation, the biomedical research complex has allocated billions of dollars and scientists have initiated hundreds of clinical trials in an expedited effort to understand, prevent, and treat this disease. National emergencies can stimulate significant investment of financial, physical, and intellectual resources that catalyze impressive scientific accomplishments, as evident with the Manhattan Project, penicillin, and the polio vaccines in the 20th century. However, pressurized research has also led to false promises, disastrous consequences, and breaches in ethics. Antiserum in the 1918 flu epidemic, contaminated yellow fever vaccines in World War II, and unethical human experimentation with mustard gas offer just a few cautionary exemplars. It is critical to continue biomedical research efforts to address this pandemic, and it is appropriate that they receive priority in both attention and funding. But history also demonstrates the importance of treating early results-such as those associated with hydroxychloroquine-with caution as we only begin to understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential target points of COVID-19.",

At academic institutions worldwide, laboratories have been forced to halt all but the most critical activities. Clinical trials of novel agents for such diseases as cancer are temporarily suspended, limiting access to potentially life-prolonging medications. Meanwhile, public health and biomedical research directed at understanding and intervening on the pandemic has been initiated with impressive rapidity. Although this boom has already begun to transform our response to the pandemic for the better, medical and scientific responses to past crises suggest that urgency may also result in compromised research quality and ethics, which may in turn jeopardize public faith in government and science, waste precious resources, and lead to the loss of human life.",

International consortia have assembled to study the pandemic and evaluate potential therapies, and elite medical journals have committed to evaluating manuscripts rapidly and to sharing data with regulatory bodies (2, 3). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued several new guidelines to facilitate these investigations, such as recommendations enabling the simultaneous production of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) testing in commercial laboratories nationwide and guidance regarding the development of convalescent plasma as a potential treatment for the viral illness (4, 5) .",

A comparable effort during World War II supported the mass production and widespread availability of penicillin. The same variables that propel medical innovation during wartime are also present in global pandemics. The polio crises of the 1950s commanded such public attention in the United States that efforts to create and evaluate a vaccine were funded by the federal government, which funded less than half of all biomedical research at the time, and were promoted by such cultural icons as baseball star Joe DiMaggio and comedian Lucille Ball (7, 8) . In all of these examples, the immediate need for an intervention combined with an enormous influx of resources to hasten the research and development process.",

However, the ferocity of the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the therapeutic imperative it seemingly mandated, led to a host of slipshod and poorly controlled (even to contemporary observers) trials of immunotherapy ranging from convalescent serum to serotype-specific antipneumococcal serotherapy for the secondary pneumonias that actually killed the majority of patients.

Scientists are using preprint websites, such as medRxiv, to disseminate new information about the virus and the pandemic rapidly. This novel approach minimizes the time to knowledge distribution, but the conclusions presented are not yet peerreviewed, and caution should be taken before changing clinical practice or public policy on the basis of these findings. Clinical trials of agents for treating COVID-19 and its related pathophysiology are in many cases single-arm studies or observational reports. This =methodology stems from physicians' reluctance to withhold potentially lifesaving treatments in a control arm, given the high mortality rate for severely ill patients. Although this is understandable-and indeed has been a dilemma since the development of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)-it is important to interpret such data with discretion until the results of RCTs are available.",

Today's serotherapy efforts and the myriad therapeutic approaches in use against COVID-19 are far more sophisticated than those taken a century ago. Moreover, we readily acknowledge the challenge of balancing expedient results with rigorous science, a calculus that appropriately shifts in times of emergency. Yet, in conducting and interpreting COVID-19-related studies, we would do well to retain the due humility and ongoing self-examination that the virus seems to have demanded in so many respects to this point.",
