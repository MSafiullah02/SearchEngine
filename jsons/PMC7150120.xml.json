Systems vary in the proportion of care delivered by public versus private facilities, in their emphasis on primary, secondary and tertiary care, in the levels and sources of funding, by the populations they serve, in the burden of disease faced by their populations, and in the level of development of the environments of human and technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, there is consensus that health information systems may have a pivotal role to play in improving quality and efficiency in all of these contexts [1], though the nature of such technological systems as well as the roles and relative importance of their individual components and their sequence of emergence will be conditioned by sociopolitical, historical, and geographical realities.",

An EHR system consolidates health datasets that were collected from an array of different sources into a person-centric health record in order to provide a more complete and longitudinal portrayal of an individual\u2019s medical history [4], [5]. However, this information may only be useful within the network of collaborating organizations. A national or regional health information exchange (HIE) must be able to harmonize the clinical information that is being collected from multiple EHR systems into a single shared longitudinal health record. These comprehensive, longitudinal records are intended to decidedly enhance the quality and productivity of health care through reductions in medical errors, decreased redundancies in testing, and averted costs [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Additionally, longitudinal records can be aggregated to provide population-level indicators of health outcomes to support public health practice, disease surveillance, health systems management, and clinical research.",

The SHR can manage both structured data that is reconcilable with standard exchange formats (eg, discrete clinical observations) and unstructured data such as a digital image with associated patient information. Additionally, point-of-service systems can update existing patient records in the SHR with new information while preserving a version history. However, the data stored in the SHR should be restricted to include only information that is deemed relevant for sharing within the implementing nation or region [10]. The SHR should not necessarily contain a complete dump of information from all point-of-service systems in the nation or region, but rather contain relevant information that when shared gives a complete view of a patient\u2019s medical history. Table 10.1\nprovides a list of some of the pertinent types of clinical data that may be stored in an SHR.\n",

In addition, client systems can query the SHR to retrieve a partial subset of a patient\u2019s medical history that has been restricted to a specific time frame or a unique type of observation. For example, a physician caring for a patient with a high diastolic blood pressure may want to know if the elevated blood pressure is a trend or just an isolated occurrence in order to determine the appropriate approach for treatment.

A health indicator is a metric that is routinely reported to provide insight into the characteristics of a population or the performance of a program [13]. An accurate assessment of the current health status of the population and influential factors within the community is essential for elevating the overall health of the community [14]. Important health indicators may constitute clinical outcomes (eg, mortality rates for cancer) or the prevalence of important health risk factors such as obesity or smoking [14]. These health indicators can be leveraged to drive public health action such as policy changes or interventions to address significant health issues [15]. Programs such as Healthy People 2020 use health indicators to help direct their agendas [13]. Aggregated health indicators allow Healthy People 2020 and other programs to identify crucial public health issues (eg, increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease), institute goals for improving the issue (eg, reduce the mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases by 15% within 10 years), and then evaluate progress toward those goals (eg, compare the baseline mortality rate to the current mortality rate) [13].",

The capacity to manage discrete values effectively, and a powerful API, made OpenMRS a favorable SHR solution for OpenHIE [10]. OpenHIE provides three different types of modules that facilitate the processing and storage of data using the OpenMRS platform including interface modules, a content handler module, and processing modules (depicted in Fig. 10.1\n). The interface modules provide service interfaces that enable an external application to access the data in the SHR. A content handler module is used to receive data from the service interfaces, and pass the information on to the proper processing module for storage. Processing modules provide the capacity to decipher information in a specific format so that it can be stored in or retrieved from the OpenMRS system. For example, a robust HIE may require a processing module that accommodates Health Level Seven (HL7) version 2 documents, processing modules for multiple types of clinical document architecture (CDA) documents, and a processing module that supports unstructured documents. Fig. 10.1 illustrates the architecture of the components that would enable OpenMRS to be implemented as the SHR for OpenHIE.",

NoSQL also supports structures such as key-value, document, and graph in addition to relational databases [27]. This flexibility allows a NoSQL DBMSs to manage the diversity of formats associated with medical data more easily than a traditional RDBMS. Additionally, NoSQL DBMSs enable horizontal scaling to increase system capacity if the need arises [27], [30]. Horizontal scalability describes the capability of the DBMS to disburse the data and workload among multiple servers [30]. However, there are also some drawbacks to NoSQL DBMSs. RDBMSs are able to complete transactions without losing data or being corrupted with more reliability than NoSQL DBMSs [27].",

Aggregate health data messages could originate in an HL7 compliant EMR system, but are just as likely to be mined from the logistics management system for cold chain management data or from simple community health worker mobile phone applications. For this reason, the HMIS community within OpenHIE is actively driving the development of a new profile in the QRPH (Quality Research and Public Health) committee of IHE called ADX (Aggregate Data Exchange). ADX is not a CDA document, owing more of its ancestry to SDMX-HD. EHR systems which can and do produce QRDA should be readily able to map that content onto ADX (though the reverse mapping would not be possible).",

The study from the Netherlands [38], for example, shows that the accuracy of indicator data derived from EHR is not necessarily better than that which was obtained from the paper registers. This result is also consistent with what the authors have seen in implementations in Rwanda and has been described in India [40]. The results are also consistent with other studies examining the quality of data in EHR-captured clinical documentation [41] as well as HIE transactions [42], [43].

A report from IOM highlights that EHR systems in the United States currently do a poor job of capturing data on the social determinants of health. Therefore, for SHR and HMIS components to support analyses of social determinants, new types of data will need to be added to Table 10.1. Additional indicators will also need to be defined as they emerge in various nations (eg, which social determinants will be of highest priority will vary by nation). Pilot efforts in Indiana as well as Oregon are just starting to gather, integrate, and analyze social determinants in combination with data from EHR systems [49], [50]. As these efforts grow, and others evolve both in the United States and globally, the requirements for the SHR and HMIS will need to be updated. Yet these components hold much promise for enabling the kind if integration and analysis envisioned by IOM and RWJF.",

As a result, clinical data are collected in many different formats including structured observations, image documents, transcribed notes, or laboratory results [29], [51], [52], [53]. This information often resides in numerous heterogeneous information systems. The ability to successfully assemble the data that are stored in disparate formats and systems into a single, integrated and longitudinal patient health record can benefit the individual patient, the healthcare organizations participating in the HIE, and the community as a whole [9], [54], [55]. An SHR simplifies interoperability between information systems by providing a centralized repository that stores the information moving throughout the HIE in order to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical care [56]. Shared, longitudinal health records can also be aggregated at the population level through systems such as the OpenHIE HMIS, and subsequently distributed through an HIE to promote the advancement of community health outcomes through policy changes, surveillance, and research [11].",
