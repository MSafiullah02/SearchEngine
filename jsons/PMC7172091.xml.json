Prior to the intervention, when a resident became unwell with respiratory symptoms and could safely be treated in the nursing home, the resident's GP would be notified by the nursing home staff and the GP would advise over the telephone or attend to the resident when available. If the resident's usual GP was unavailable, an after-hours locum GP would be organized to visit the resident if deemed necessary by the nursing home staff. A routine infection register with associated antibiotic prescribing was maintained in each home, started by the nursing staff when a resident became unwell, and completed and monitored by the infection control nurse consultants.",

In the weeks prior to the intervention period, the nursing home nurses and GPs were provided with education (written handouts for the GPs and an education session with an infection control nurse consultant for the nurses) with regard to following practices as described in Therapeutic guidelines: antibiotic,19 in which they were to consider the use of PCR testing of respiratory specimens for residents with new-onset clinical signs or symptoms of RTI whenever they were considering the need for an antibiotic to treat an RTI or whenever there was a suspected influenza-like illness or outbreak. The usual care relationships and systems at each participating nursing home to identify and treat residents who were unwell were maintained (eg, family members were notified and asked to verbally consent if that was the usual practice for an unwell resident). The nursing home was asked to notify the resident's GP when a respiratory specimen was collected for PCR testing. An investigator (L.D.) met with the nurses, GPs, other staff, residents, and family members from the nursing homes to explain the study and distribute information materials about the intervention. The infection control nurse consultants conducted education sessions with staff from the homes, including education for nurses regarding the collection of respiratory specimens (from the nasopharynx) using flocked swabs.",

This suggests that in real-world practice, educating and empowering nursing home nurses to recognize respiratory symptoms and initiate swabbing for PCR testing can increase the number of tests within a nursing home and provide more information about circulating respiratory pathogens. This study identified a high rate of viral respiratory pathogens circulating in nursing home settings (50.7%). Despite the increase in identification of viruses through PCR, there was no change in the pattern of antibiotic prescribing.",

Although the protocol specified the results of the PCR testing were to be forwarded to the resident's GP, who was \u201coffsite,\u201d the use of paper records in these nursing homes meant that information on \u201cif and when\u201d the GPs reviewed the results could not be documented. In some acute hospital settings, reporting similar results directly to attending physicians has also not been sufficient to change antibiotic prescribing behaviors.24, 25, 26 In hospitals, reporting the PCR result to an AMS team along with specific advice from the AMS team about antibiotic cessation is required to impact prescribing behavior.24 Slow transfer of information, lack of confidence in the results, and other factors within the nursing homes, such as work flow, resident mix, and prescriber preferences for overly cautious antibiotic prescribing,27 may have affected the outcome of this study. The impact of the PCR testing might have been more significant if a clear algorithm to guide prescribers regarding how to respond to the results was in place. Prescribers might also have needed more information to improve their confidence in the validity of the results.",
