            "text": "fertilized eggs, and even whole organisms as substrates for virus propagation (Hess et al. 2012 ; Barrett et al. 2009 ). Today, vaccine manufacturers are increasingly shifting toward virus growth on continuous cell lines. This brings certain advantages such as reduced production costs, increased vaccine safety, and relatively straightforward upscaling (Barrett et al. 2009 ). Once the virus has been propagated, it is often purified and concentrated prior to inactivation. Inactivation can be performed using chemical or physical methods or a combination of the two. A wide range of well-established and novel inactivation agents or methods have been described to successfully inactivate viruses for vaccine purposes. Examples are ascorbic acid (Madhusudana et al. 2004) , ethylenimine derivatives (Larghi and Nebel 1980) , psorlens (Maves et al. 2011) , hydrogen peroxide (Amanna et al. 2012) , gamma irradiation (Martin et al. 2010a; Alsharifi and Mullbacher 2010) , UV treatment (Budowsky et al. 1981) , heat (Nims and Plavsic 2012) , and many more (Stauffer et al. 2006) . Nonetheless, only formaldehyde and \u03b2-Propiolactone (BPL) are widely used for inactivation of licensed human viral vaccines for decades.",

The Cutter incident in 1955 was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in the US. history. Here, 380,000 doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), produced at Cutter laboratories, were administered to healthy children. However, these vaccines contained replication competent poliovirus due to inadequate purification of the viral harvest during production. The presence of cell debris in the vaccine pools prevented suitable exposure of the viral particles to formaldehyde and therefore complete inactivation (Offit 2005) . As a consequence, 40,000 children who received the vaccine contracted abortive poliomyelitis, 51 were permanently paralyzed, and five died (Nathanson and Langmuir 1963) . Federal requirements for vaccine manufacturers were immediately revised in reaction to the Cutter incident creating a better system of regulating vaccines. However, the legacy remains and vaccine manufacturers should always exercise utmost caution when inactivating pathogens to ensure complete inactivation.",

Indeed, clinical trials with a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in na\u00efve infants had a disastrous outcome. Not only did the vaccine fail to prevent disease, 80 % of vaccine recipients were hospitalized after encountering circulating RSV as compared to hospitalization of only 5 % in the control vaccine group. Furthermore, two vaccine recipients died as a consequence of the vaccine induced enhanced disease (Kapikian et al. 1969; Kim et al. 1969; Castilow et al. 2007 ). The enhanced disease was later attributed to an unfavorable immune response due to a skewed Th2 response and lack of antibody affinity maturation after vaccination (Delgado et al. 2009; Johnson and Graham 2004) . Furthermore, a large portion of vaccineinduced antibodies were directed to nonprotective epitopes as formalin treatment had altered the epitopes which induce functional (neutralizing and fusion inhibiting) antibodies that are assumed to be required for protection (Murphy and Walsh 1988) .",

The vaccine did induce neutralizing antibodies, however, immunity waned rapidly and recipients regained susceptibility to measles. When contracted, a more severe, atypical measles disease developed (Griffin and Pan 2009) . As with RSV, the enhanced disease was associated with a lack of cytolytic T-cell response and low avidity antibodies (Polack et al. 1999 (Polack et al. , 2003 , linked to the formaldehyde-induced alteration of the measles F protein (Annunziato et al. 1982) . In general, it has been suggested that the carbonyl groups on vaccine antigens introduced by formaldehyde treatment induce profound effects on immunogenicity which may tip the balance between protection and adverse effects, or enhanced disease (Moghaddam et al. 2006) . These unfortunate events serve as a warning to all vaccine developers; inactivation of a pathogen does not necessarily translate into a vaccine that by default elicits protective immunity, viral epitopes necessary for induction of protective immunity should be preserved after inactivation.",

The realization that inadequately inactivated viruses could result in such tragedy instigated the need for the exertion of control over the production process. It is for this reason that today inactivation processes require vigilantly designed and validated inactivation assays to ensure pathogens are inactivated with utmost certainty. Concurrently, the successfully formulated inactivated viral vaccines on the market today have a heightened safety aspect as compared to live attenuated viral vaccines. The fact that the pathogen is completely inactivated directly negates reversion to a virulent phenotype within the vaccine recipient. Moreover, these inactivated vaccine viruses are nontransmissible as their live attenuated counterparts. Indeed, reversion and transmission are the greatest drawbacks of attenuated vaccines and have been observed in the past with the attenuated poliovirus vaccine (Henderson et al. 1964) , yellow fever vaccine (Lindsey et al. 2008) , and rotavirus vaccine (Patel et al. 2009 ). The improved safety profile of inactivated vaccines entails that they are also suitable for the rapidly increasing group of immunocompromised individuals (Ljungman 2012) .",

The KOI will differ per pathogen and inactivation method, therefore, to ensure the safety of the inactivated vaccine bulk, the inactivation process should be studied extensively, where observation of a reproducible KOI is essential. Quantification of viral infectivity in either the vaccine bulk or in-process intermediates is usually achieved by an in vitro cell culture-based assay, however this can also be done in vivo. Generally, either the cell line used for virus propagation or an alternative cell line, demonstrated to be equally susceptible, is inoculated with the (inactivated) virus sample to amplify any potential infectious unit present. Presence or absence of virus in in vitro cultures can be detected by various methods; for lytic viruses this is enabled by monitoring of cytopathic effect (CPE), for nonlytic viruses methods based on genome amplification (PCR) or antigen detection (immune-fluorescence or ELISA) can be used. In addition, a second step involving inoculation of amplified material in an appropriate in vivo model followed by monitoring for the onset of disease symptoms, can be performed.",

            "text": "Since testing for effective inactivation is dependent on assay sensitivity, sample volume, and the absence of interference by inactivated particles, the assay used to confirm completeness of inactivation (COI) should be designed to be easily scaled up, with high sensitivity and rigorous controls for assay sensitivity and matrix effects. Specifically, positive controls including samples spiked with a known concentration of virus to confirm susceptibility of the cell cultures. Furthermore, negative matrix controls are taken along to ensure no other components in the formulation induce cell death or interfere with assay sensitivity. When making an inference on the COI, two variables play a role. The first one relates to the sensitivity of the COI assay which must be characterized to assign a minimum number of infectious units (i.e., lower limit of detection) that can be detected using the assay. The second one relates to the sampling size; the larger the volume of the test sample, the higher the chance of detecting a potential infectious unit in the entire batch. The combination of these two variables allows the manufacturer to either specify a maximally tolerable level of outgoing infectivity (Cornfield et al. 1956 ) or adhere to a predefined criterion. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) have stipulated guidelines for testing for effective inactivation with a minimum sample, expressed in volume or number of doses, which must be tested. Furthermore, cell types, duration of incubation, and dilution of vaccine sample prior to inoculation are parameters that can influence the sensitivity of the COI and thus must be thoroughly optimized. The testing for COI for the different vaccines will be discussed per vaccine in more detail later in this chapter.",

Furthermore, tests are required to assess the purity of the vaccine product, such as testing for the absence of contaminants arising from the production process such as host cell protein and DNA. Additionally, to ensure no modification of epitopes occurs during inactivation, as was observed with RSV and measles in the past, the immunogenic potency of the inactivated virus particle must be measured. This can be achieved by measuring the immune response before and after immunization in vivo, for example the Rat potency assay which is used to measure poliovirus neutralizing antibodies after immunization of rats with an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (van Steenis et al. 1981) . In vivo immunogenicity testing can also been correlated to in vitro cell-based potency assays; such as the D-antigen ELISA which quantifies the antigenic content of inactivated poliovirus particles and is consequently used for dosing of the vaccine (Beale 1961) . Different in vitro quality control systems to monitor antigenic integrity of an inactivated vaccine have been developed for rabies (Rooijakkers et al. 1996a, b) , influenza (Di Trani et al. 2003) , poliovirus (Morgeaux et al. 2005) , and hepatitis A virus (Poirier et al. 2010) . Naturally, the development of such assays requires knowledge of the neutralizing epitopes necessary for an adequate immune response, and consequently, protection.",

However, inactivated vaccines are typically associated with a lower immunogenicity which can imply the necessity of multiple doses or adjuvant addition which consequently raises the costs of goods and vaccine pricing. Therefore, choosing an inactivated vaccine approach is in general a trade-off with on one hand increased safety (if inactivation is of course complete) and a fast pathway to regulatory approval, but on the other hand the risk of reduced antigenicity of the immunogen which often requires adjuvant addition and/or multiple doses which not only raises production costs but also the complexity of formulation and administration.",

At the time, it was largely believed that long lasting immunity required the administration of a live vaccine for successful immunization and protection, as was observed with the live attenuated small pox and yellow fever vaccines. However, Salk's prior experience with formalin-inactivated influenza prompted him to believe that inactivated vaccines were possible and stimulated his research on PV inactivation using formalin. Aware of the disastrous events that came to pass with the first generation of inactivated PV vaccines, Salk vigilantly investigated formalin inactivation to guarantee safety of the vaccine preparations and established the principle of inactivation which started with the description of PV inactivation in 1953. At low temperatures the activity of formaldehyde is relatively low and might, thereby, be more selective in destroying infectivity without impairing too greatly the antigenic activity of the virus. Salk therefore inactivated PV using a 1/250 dilution of 37 % formaldehyde (corresponding to a final concentration of 0.4 % formalin) at the temperature of melting ice (Salk 1953) . In the meantime, virus cultivation methods improved (Farrell et al. 1955 ) and higher titers of virus required up to 3 weeks of inactivation (Salk et al. 1954) . To be able to inactivate also more potent batches of virus, Jonas Salk modified his inactivation process, now using a higher temperature (35-37\u00b0C) and a lower concentration of formalin (1/4,000-1/8,000). The resulting process demonstrated linear inactivation kinetics and was able to inactivate also more potent batches of PV in a comparable timeframe (Salk et al. 1954; Salk and Gori 1960) . Figure 2 .1 is a graphical representation of an inactivation kinetics curve and illustrates Salk's determination of the minimum required inactivation time.",

In his experience, the thermal inactivation of PV at 37\u00b0C was in the order of magnitude of 1-2 log units in 3 days ( 1 = 3 -2 = 3 ) log per day). With the aim of eliminating the thermal component from the PV inactivation, Gard selected 25\u00b0C where the thermal inactivation was only 0.3 log units in 5 days (0.06 log per day), together with 0.006 M formaldehyde (Gard 1957a, b) . However, using these conditions a significant deviation from Salk's linear relationship was observed (Gard 1957a, b; Lycke et al. 1957) . To date, these observations are referenced to as evidence that the kinetics of formaldehyde inactivation is not linear or first-order (Bahnemann 1990; Brown 1993) . In fact, whereas the kinetics of inactivation did not follow a first-order inactivation when performed at 4 or 25\u00b0C, no deviation from first-order was observed at 37\u00b0C (Salk and Gori 1960) . Similarly, the inactivation of HAV-a process based on the principles of Salk-for the VAQTA vaccine showed no evidence of departure from linearity through 7 logs of inactivation (Armstrong et al. 1993) .",

(1957) , studied both formalin and thermal inactivation at 37\u00b0C. Their results indicated that, contrary to the previously perceived thermal inactivation of 0.3-0.6 log per day (Gard 1957a, b) , the thermal inactivation could be limited to 0.2 log per day and the addition of cations further improved thermal stability of PV (Salk et al. 1954) . The rate of destruction of infectivity in the bulk is followed by determining, for example, viral titers (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 %, TCID 50 ) (1). A straight line is drawn through these experimentally attained data points and extrapolated to the point indicating complete absence of infectivity at the intercept of x-axis (2). Followed by taking into account the total volume (i.e., 50 L) to be inactivated (3) and a safety margin to allow for imperfections in the sensitivity of the tissue culture system used for detection of residual replication competent virus (4), the total inactivation time is defined as a total period equal to three times the interval required for interception of the baseline (\u03c7) which would, in this example, correspond to an incubation time of 9 days (Melnick 1991) . Specifically, the addition of 1 M of MgCl 2 prevented thermal inactivation without an effect on the rate of formalin inactivation (Ozaki and Melnick 1963) .",

Briefly, the rate of destruction of infectivity in the bulk is followed by measuring for example the viral titer over time, which is measured by observing the (lack) of cytopathic effect in cells inoculated with the sample. When taking samples during inactivation, it must be taken into account that the formaldehyde present in the in-process sample must be neutralized prior to titration, for example, by addition of sodium bisulfite. Once viral titers during inactivation are obtained a straight line is drawn through these points and extrapolated to the point that indicates complete absence of infectivity. By taking into account the volume of the bulk that is being inactivated and a safety margin, the inactivation time can be defined as a total period equal to three times the interval required for interception of baseline (Salk et al. 1954 ). This principle is still used to define the minimum time that is required for complete inactivation (Armstrong et al. 1993; WHO 2002; Plotkin and Vidor 2004) . However, studies investigating the effect of prolonged inactivation-treatment with formaldehyde beyond the time that is required for complete destruction of infectivity-showed that after a certain time, antigenicity of the material will decline (Salk and Gori 1960) . Specifically, overtreatment of PV is defined as a period equal to more than fivefold the time required to reduce infectivity beyond the point at which it cannot be measured (Salk 1955) . In summary, the inactivation time for PV can be defined as at least 3X but not more than 5X.",

Using this technique, B\u00f6ttiger et al., demonstrated in 1957 and 1958 , that formalin treatment alone produces a delay in initiating infection of tissue cultures as evidenced by the rate of appearance of plaque formation. Since the delay is progressively greater with extended formalin treatment, it becomes more and more important to prolong the observation period as complete inactivation by formalin is approached (Schultz et al. 1957; Bottiger et al. 1958) . Consequently, large scale tissue culture safety tests include extended incubations-up to 35 days (Beardmore et al. 1957) for the detection of replication competent virus. Noteworthy here is that fully active PV could be detected within 14 days whereas false negatives occurred with formalin treated virus if not for the 21-and 28-days subcultures (Beardmore et al. 1957) . Consequently, design of methods for demonstrating completeness of inactivation of formalin-inactivated virus should include verification and challenging of incubation times not only with fully active virus but also with formalin treated virus. In conclusion, current guidelines recommend to continue cultures for the detection of residual replication competent virus for as long as technically feasible (WHO 2002) .",

Alternatively, one can estimate the concentration of residual free formaldehyde. There are a number of methods available for the determination of residual free formaldehyde in inactivated vaccines which are based on Hantzsch, MBTH, Phenylhydrazine, Tryptophan, Chromotropic acid, and Schiff reagents Chandler and Frerichs 1980) .

Together with assumption on viral dispersion in the vaccine bulk, sensitivity of the detection system, and the viral concentration capable of inducing infection in man, one can determine an acceptable volume to test for a satisfactory probability of complete inactivation (Cornfield et al. 1956; Meier 1957) . Therefore, the probability of detection of infectious virus at various virus concentrations per liter can be calculated, and upon assigning values for c and p one can calculate the testing volume necessary to measure virus at low levels with high probability of true detection. For example, a report published in 1956 by the US Public Health Service (Cornfield et al. 1956 ) recommended that 1,500 mL be tested from each of the single strain bulks on the basis of an \"acceptable\" level of infectivity set at an arbitrary 5 particulates per liter (White 1955) . This means that with a bulk containing 5 or more particulates per liter, sampling 1,500 mL of this bulk should result in a probability of \u226599.9 % that the sample will contain \u22651 replication competent virus which should be unequivocally positive in the detection system. Today, WHO and Ph. Eur. continue to adhere to the statistical sampling described in the 1950s, and consequently the testing for completeness of inactivation of IPV requires two samples that are equivalent to 1,500 adult doses to be tested in vitro on a susceptible cell type. Absence of PV infection in cell tissue cultures inoculated with these doses for at least 3 weeks is required before the monovalent bulk can be released for vaccine formulation (Ph. Eur. 2011d; WHO 2002) .",

            "text": "The decades of research and experience with IPV has lead to its role as benchmark for the formalin inactivation of other pathogens in the vaccine field. The lessons learned in the beginning and middle of the last century had paved the way for the formulation of the Hepatitis A picornavirus vaccine. As with IPV, the manufacturability of a Hepatitis A vaccine required the successful propagation of the virus in a suitable substrate. The breakthrough of HAV growth in MRC-5 and WI-38 cell culture was achieved at the end of the 1970s by Maurice Hilleman et al. (Provost and Hilleman 1979) . Not only were these strains adapted to cell culture to allow large scale vaccine production, they had also lost their virulence during cell culture adaptation and were considered attenuated. In fact, their use as live vaccines has also been investigated (Midthun et al. 1991; Provost et al. 1986a ). Nonetheless, development of an inactivated vaccine was favored due to the faster route to regulatory approval, resulting in a safe and effective formalin-inactivated vaccine in 1986 (Provost et al. 1986b) . Table 2 .1 gives an overview of the currently licensed Hepatitis A vaccines. Manufacturing of these vaccines follows the general flow of events for all inactivated vaccines; virus propagation, harvest and purification, inactivation, further purification, and testing for residual replication competent virus. All manufacturers use the diploid human MRC-5 cell line for the propagation of different Hepatitis A strains of which HM175 and CR326 have been shown to be highly attenuated. Purification and concentration are followed by inactivation. Specifications for inactivation conditions such as formaldehyde concentration, temperature and length of inactivation, are undefined. Instead a manufacturer validated inactivation procedure is used, with elucidation of inactivation kinetics and extrapolation of the curve where 100 % inactivation is achieved and multiplication of this inactivation time by a factor 3 is required, as is the case for IPV (Ph. Eur. 2011b; WHO 1995) . The inactivation kinetics of Merck's VAQTA vaccine have been described in the literature and show linear inactivation kinetics for formaldehyde at various formaldehyde concentrations tested. Formaldehyde at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml and Vidor et al. (1996) Gluck et al. (1992) at a temperature of 37\u00b0C reduced infectious titers to 1 (TCID 50 )/ml within 48 h (Armstrong et al. 1993) . The reduction in infectivity is quantified by titration in susceptible cells (i.e., MRC5). During manufacturing of VAQTA, HAV is inactivated during 20 days, which is tenfold the time needed to reach the x-intercept. This process thus exceeds by far the threefold inactivation time specified by regulatory authorities; the authors suggest that prolonged incubation of HAV with formaldehyde does not compromise the immunogenicity of the virus particle, which is not the case for PV, as described earlier.",

JEV is most prevalent in Asian regions (Gupta 1998) whereas TBE can be encountered in European to Asian regions (Rendi-Wagner 2008) . Due to their limited distribution, vaccines against these viruses are not produced in quantities for global immunization but instead at quantities that can supply inhabitants of endemic areas, as well as travelers and expatriates (WHO 2006b (WHO , 2011 . Manufacturing of these vaccines occurs mainly in the endemic areas by local manufacturers; therefore regulations for safe vaccine production are largely left to the scrutiny of the national regulatory authority. As is the case for HAV vaccines and IPV, global regulatory authorities such as WHO and Ph. Eur. do not specify any inactivation conditions. Instead manufacturers are again expected to demonstrate extensive studies on the inactivation of JE and TBE virus by using, for example, formalin to create safe vaccine batches. The local national authority would then determine whether the vaccine inactivation procedure is sufficient to guarantee a safe, completely inactivated vaccine. The WHO does, however, give examples of methods that have been used for the inactivation of JEV and TBE vaccines; for JEV this is stated as 50-60 days at 4\u00b0C with a formaldehyde concentration of 1 in 2000 (WHO 2007b) although for a Vero-based JEV vaccine inactivation during several months at 4\u00b0C with a higher formalin concentration of 0.08 % was used (Sugawara et al. 2002) . For TBE manufacture a formaldehyde concentration of 0.05 % is proposed with an inactivation time of 5 days at 22\u00b0C (WHO 1999) . For WHO approval, testing for completeness of inactivation requires testing of 25 human doses for JEV (WHO 2007b) and 20 doses for TBE (WHO 1999) , while the Ph. Eur. requires a minimum of 10 human doses for TBE (Ph. Eur. 2011f) . The vaccine doses are to be amplified on a suitable cell substrate followed by intracerebral inoculation of mice with the resulting culture fluid.",

In general, the higher the formalin concentration and temperature the faster the inactivation, but this may come at a cost on immunogenicity as thermal degradation and destruction of important epitopes upon higher formalin concentration is a known phenomenon. Therefore, an inactivation time must be sufficient to ascertain complete inactivation but not too long as to destroy immunogenicity, concurrently, a manufacturer should monitor immunogenicity of the inactivated sample during inactivation to ensure no loss of antigenic potential. When faced with the development of an inactivated viral vaccine, an in depth understanding of the particular pathogen's inactivation kinetics curve is inevitable as well as the necessity for a robust test for completeness of inactivation. Only then a reproducible and validated inactivation procedure can be set in place to ensure that a negative result in the test is a true measure for the absence of replication competent virus in a vaccine batch.",

The chemical reactivity of the almost planar, energetically highly strained four-membered ring provides the organic compound with its electrophilic nature and thus the ability to react readily with nucleophiles. While being stable in concentrated liquid form, in aqueous solutions it is unstable due to rapid hydrolysis that allows it to react with hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phenolic groups (Hartman and Logrippo 1957) . The reactions of BPL with all solution constituents make BPL in essence a self limiting compound. The rapid hydrolysis into nontoxic, noncarcinogenic products will completely eliminate BPL levels from the reaction within 2 h at 37\u00b0C. This gives BPL an advantage over formaldehyde inactivation where residual formalin must be removed. In addition to its self-limiting nature, excess BPL can be neutralized by the addition of thiosulphate, for example, when sampling virus during inactivation. This method is preferred over a high temperature spike for the neutralization of BPL activity as the latter may have the unwanted side effect of thermal degradation of the virus (Lawrence 2000) . All reactions with BPL are rapid and stable. Alkylation or acylation reactions with interacting nucleophiles, which are repeatedly present in large biological macromolecules such as DNA and RNA, are irreversible.",

However, it was not until 1941 when a novel method of synthesis was introduced by Kung to form BPL from ketene and formalin, that the widespread use of this organic compound began (Hartman and Logrippo 1957) . After the discovery of this novel production method, BPL was subject to extensive characterization and research leading to the chemical's fast introduction into multiple industries with varying roles. BPL has been used as a sterilizing agent for tissue grafts and plasma, a monomer for the plastic polymerization industry, an intermediate in the synthesis of propionic compounds, and a virucidal inactivating agent for vaccine purposes (Hartman et al. 1954; Lawrence 1999) . The extensive use of BPL in these industries was somewhat reduced when BPL's carcinogenic nature was recognized. Rightfully so, the use of carcinogens in production processes is considered a safety hazard (Hueper 1963) . Nonetheless, BPL has remained essential for the production of the abovementioned licensed BPL-inactivated vaccines as levels of BPL are completely hydrolyzed during vaccine production and residual levels verified.",

            "text": "The mechanism of action by which BPL can inactivate viruses is thought to lie primarily in its direct interaction with nucleic acids (Colburn et al. 1965; Mate et al. 1977; Roberts and Warwick 1963) . The alkylation and acylation reactions between nucleotides and BPL have been extensively studied. It has been shown that BPL mainly reacts with the Nitrogen-7 atom of guanosine, and to a lesser extent with adenosine at the N 1 position (Hemminki 1981) . The BPL-modified guanine is then misread by the polymerase as an adenine, therefore for every alkylated guanosine a GC-AT transition mutation is incorporated (Segal et al. 1981 ). These multiple mutations in combination with BPL-induced DNA double helix cross-linking (Perrin and Morgeaux 1995) can render the genomes dysfunctional, ultimately making the pathogen replication incompetent, leading to its complete inactivation. As BPL primarily interacts with DNA or RNA, it was assumed that the immunogenic epitopes of the protein would remain intact; entailing that BPL-inactivated viruses would maintain their high immunogenicity, which is not always the case for formaldehyde inactivated viruses. However, amino acids and proteins also display nucleophilic moieties with which BPL can readily interact, and so, as with formaldehyde, the interaction of BPL with viral proteins could induce conformational changes on the viral surface. This could result in the alteration of epitopes necessary for the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the pathogen. Uittenbogaard et al. have elucidated the alkylation or acylation modifications that BPL induces on amino acids. They have shown that BPL reacts with nine different amino acids (Uittenbogaard et al. 2011 ) which implies that BPL inactivation could result in alteration of important immunogenic epitopes necessary for an immune response. However, BPL will react more readily with nucleotides in DNA and RNA than with amino acid moieties. BPL mediated alkylation or acylation of viral constituents induces significant modifications of these complex molecules which prevents viral replication, upon which the virus particle is considered to be inactivated (Dijkstra 1975; Logrippo 1960; Roberts and Warwick 1963) . Overall, the impact of BPL on immunogenicity varies per pathogen but is lower than the impact of formalin as BPL interacts with protein moieties to a lesser extent.",

            "text": "Viral inactivation is directly correlated with the nature of the virus, the initial concentration of BPL, the temperature, and the composition of the solution during inactivation . For vaccine production, these parameters are generally set at 4\u00b0C for 18-24 h with a BPL concentration of 0.1-0.25 %, however, this can differ per pathogen (Lawrence 2000) . Understanding of BPL inactivation kinetics is essential to ensure complete vaccine safety which dictates a reduction of infectivity of initial virus suspension by 15-20 orders of magnitude. This is based on various factors such as minimum probabilities of viral presence in a whole batch and doses necessary for immunization (Budowsky and Zalesskaya 1991) . The magnitude of 15-20 orders of inactivation cannot be determined experimentally but requires extrapolation of kinetics data obtained from the experimentally detectable parts of the inactivation kinetics curves (Budowsky and Zalesskaya 1991) . Viral inactivation curves after exposure to BPL are not linear and display a phenomenon called \"tailing\": a reduction in inactivation rate during BPL treatment. This is due to the decrease in BPL concentration over time that is caused by the reaction of the agent with virus, water, or medium components, which decreases the rate of inactivation over time. The kinetics of viral inactivation can be described rather accurately when the varying BPL consumption rates over the reaction are taken into account using the following formula: Budowsky and Zalesskaya 1991 \u00f0 \u00de where S 0 and S t are the numbers of infectious particles before and at time t after beginning of inactivation, A 0 is the initial concentration of BPL, k is the initial infectivity inactivation rate constant, and k 1 is the total rate constant for the consumption of BPL during inactivation. This description of inactivation kinetics allows, when rate constants are known, the calculation duration of inactivation necessary to reduce infectivity of the virus to any given extent, which can ensure a completely inactivated, safe vaccine (Budowsky and Zalesskaya 1991) . Figure 2 .2 depicts the theoretical BPL inactivation curves as calculated by the above formula, as well as experimental data. Initial concentrations of BPL and inactivation temperatures are investigated; in all reactions the tailing phenomenon is visible. In the end, the BPL mediated alkylation or acylation of viral constituents, whether nucleic acids or proteins has resulted in the organic compounds being used in virus inactivation for decades, with two, currently licensed, human BPL-inactivated vaccines on the market and multiple vaccines in development.

Over the course of more than 80 years, the currently available inactivated influenza vaccines have undergone several improvements and have shown significant benefits for society (Clover et al. 1991; Edwards et al. 1994; Gruber et al. 1990; Neuzil et al. 2001; Wilde et al. 1999) , however, breadth of protection and efficacy of currently available vaccines are still insufficient to diminish the current annual health burden induced by the virus. Differences in protective efficacy may result from continuing antigenic variation in the prevalent epidemic strains. Due to this variation, the composition of inactivated influenza virus vaccine, unlike that of most viral vaccines, must be kept constantly under review. Accordingly, WHO publishes recommendations concerning the strains to be included in the vaccine twice annually (WHO 2000 (WHO , 2009a Ghendon 1991) . Until recently inactivated influenza vaccines consisted of three inactivated viruses; two Influenza A strains and one B strain, however, a new pattern of influenza B circulation has rendered it troublesome to predict the global dominance of one of the two influenza B lineages (Paiva et al. 2013) . Therefore, quadrivalent influenza vaccines have been developed to ensure broader protection against Type B influenza viruses as compared to the trivalent vaccines which contained only one Type B influenza strain from one lineage. The licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines are formulated in the same way as their trivalent counterparts, however, two influenza B strains, one from the Victoria lineage and one from the Yamagata lineage, are included in the formulation.",

Currently, licensed vaccines are inactivated using either BPL or formaldehyde. Although formaldehyde inactivated vaccines are successful in eliciting protection against influenza, it has been reported that formaldehyde interferes with the fusion ability of the inactivated virus particle (Geeraedts et al. 2012) which in turn prohibits an optimal CTL response. This is not observed for BPL-inactivated influenza virus (Budimir et al. 2012) . According to the Ph. Eur (2011c) , the concentration of BPL and formaldehyde cannot exceed 0.1 % (v/v) and 0.02 %, respectively, during the entire inactivation procedure. Other inactivation parameters, such as time of inactivation and temperature are not specified. As with formalin-inactivated vaccines, a manufacturer-validated inactivation method must be demonstrated to the approving regulatory body. The principles of influenza inactivation have been investigated with respect to initial BPL concentration, temperature, and composition of the solution where it was shown that inactivation of influenza A at 20\u00b0C at BPL concentrations of 0.011 or 0.055 M ranges from 35 to 170 min, depending on whether the virus sample is purified or in harvested allantoic fluid . Testing for effective inactivation is specified by the Ph. Eur. (2011c), and should be performed by inoculation of either embryonated hens' eggs or the cell substrate that was used for vaccine production with a fixed amount of vaccine product, after which the cultures are tested for abscense of heamaglutination, which is a surrogate for infectious virus activity.",

Pasteur introduced an experimental rabies vaccine in 1885 when he observed the rapid decrease of rabies virus virulence upon air drying of rabies-infected rabbit spinal cords. Serially less dried rabies-infected rabbit spinal cords containing inactivated-or at least partially inactivated-rabies viruses induced protection of dogs and later humans against challenge following inoculation (Bazin 2011; Pasteur et al. 1885 ). This method of vaccination, although it was considered a treatment for infected people at the time, was the foundation for rabies vaccines. However, Pasteur faced significant criticism from the scientific community as recipients were essentially inoculated with virulent virus at the end of the treatment (Burke 1996; Gelfand 2002; Wu et al. 2011 ). This set the incentive to chemically inactivate the rabies virus with phenol in 1908 leading to the first completely inactivated rabies vaccine, despite the disruptive action of phenol on the antigenic sites on the proteins (Fermi 1908; Semple 1911; Briggs 2012 ).",

This due to the fact that vaccines based on adult mammalian nerve tissue were associated with effects such as encephalomyelitis and demyelination lesions in the CNS due to the presence of myelin (Bonito et al. 2004; Bahri et al. 1996) . Therefore, the WHO currently does not recommend the use and production of nerve tissue vaccines (WHO 2005) and has been advocating use of cell culture or embryonated eggs as production platforms since 1983 (WHO 1984) . In the US, only cell culture derived rabies vaccines are approved for commercial use, however, some African and Latin American countries continue to produce and use nerve tissue vaccines by phenol inactivation, where the vaccine production protocol resembles the methods from a century ago (Briggs 2012) . Today, there are two primary avian cell lines used for rabies vaccine production; purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) and purified duck embryo rabies vaccine (PDEV) and multiple continuous cell lines such as MRC-5, Vero, and primary hamster kidney cells. However, inactivated vaccines produced on continuous cell lines are not completely free from adverse reactions. There are reports on reactogenicity in response to vaccination with the human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCRV) which may relate to the presence of BPL-altered human albumin, added as a stabilizer to vaccine preparations (Anderson et al. 1987; Swanson et al. 1987 ). Nonetheless, cell culture based vaccines are still vastly preferred over nerve tissue vaccines. Moreover, an additional advantage of the use of a cell line platform, for instance Vero cells, is that they can be cultured in large scale in fermenters on microcarriers which contributes to standardization, safety, and upscaling of the production system resulting in constant yields.",

Eur. 2011e). However, there are exceptions such as the use of formalin for Primary Hamster kidney cell culture vaccine (PHKCV). As with the formalin-inactivated vaccines, the inactivation curves have to be validated and approved by the regulatory body. After inactivation, different purification standards can be used such as ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, zonal centrifugation, or chromatography. Once formulated, the vaccine potency for all these vaccines is determined by quantifying the degrees of protection against rabies following immunizing and intracerebral challenge of mice (de Moura et al. 2009; Fitzgerald et al. 1978) . Based on the results of this National Institutes of Health (NIH) test, the vaccine dosing is set at 2.5 International Units/dose. Many regulatory authorities, including the Ph. Eur. and WHO, have adopted the NIH potency test as the only assay for potency quantification of inactivated Rabies vaccines, despite the recognition of the fact that the animal test should be replaced by an antigen quantification procedure (Bruckner et al. 2003) . The vaccine is further tested for complete inactivation by inoculating the cell substrate used for manufacturing with 25 human vaccine doses or more. Cultures are examined for the presence of newly produced rabies virus using immunofluorescence.",

A thoroughly studied inactivation curve of virus activity is required for validation of inactivation parameters and confident declaration of viral absence, which a regulatory agency can consequently approve for vaccine licensure. As compared to formaldehyde inactivation, BPL inactivation times are significantly shorter where minutes to hours can suffice in inactivating viral activity as compared to the days or months needed for formaldehyde inactivation. Further advantages of BPL inactivation is the lower inactivation temperature which may prevent thermal degradation of important epitopes, moreover, protein moieties are less likely to be altered by BPL due to the primary reaction of the compound with nucleic acids. Despite the evident advantages of BPL, formaldehyde is more widely used for inactivation of pathogens, perhaps due to historical use of the compound and years of experience which has paved regulatory pathways for the licensure. Nonetheless, it is evident that the advantages of BPL should be considered by vaccine manufacturers for viral inactivation.",

The relative straightforwardness in which an inactivated vaccine is produced and licensed, accompanied by the fact that inactivated vaccines cannot revert as their replication competent counterparts can do, explains the fact that there are new inactivated pathogens that are being evaluated as vaccine candidates. However, inactivation does not always guarantee the creation of a suitable vaccine as was observed with pathogens such as RSV and measles, therefore immunogenicity of the novel inactivated particle must always be thoroughly tested.

This drives the investigation of alternative inactivation methods that do not alter epitopes or skew immune responses to ensure a protective vaccine with high efficiency. Three new inactivation methods, being hydrogen peroxide treatment, zinc-finger reactive treatment, and gamma irradiation are described in more detail below. Whether these inactivation methods will be implemented in the manufacturing of vaccines remains to be determined.",

Oxidizing agents are an essential part of the mammalian innate immune system (Valko et al. 2007 ) and use of such agents, like H 2 O 2 , as antimicrobial and antiseptic agents have been well established (Linley et al. 2012 ). However, the use of H 2 O 2 in the inactivated vaccine industry was never considered as H 2 O 2 is believed to irreversibly damage basic molecular structure of proteins (Skykes 1965) . H 2 O 2 inactivation of a range of DNA and RNA viruses showed minimal damage to epitopes compared to BPL and formalin. In addition, superiority of H 2 O 2 inactivated vaccines was demonstrated by the elicitation of a strong neutralizing antibody response, effective T cell responses, and protection in mice (Amanna et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, the use of H 2 O 2 requires a much shorter inactivation time in comparison to formalin and decomposes into nontoxic products (water and oxygen). Mechanism for H 2 O 2 inactivation is the genomic damage induced by hydroxyl radical attack on nucleosides resulting in single-or double-strand breaks ultimately leading to inactivation of the virus (Termini 2000) . The authors propose H 2 O 2 as a feasible, broad-spectrum, and effective inactivation platform.",

The vital role of this motif has lead to the discovery and development of various compounds that covalently bind these motifs and abrogate infectivity of viruses (Rice et al. 1995) . Despite the loss of infectivity, the inactivated virus still retains the capacity to enter target cells as well as its structural and functional integrity (Rossio et al. 1998) . To that end, use of zinc-finger reactive compounds was examined for RSV inactivation with maximum preservation of the virion surface structure. RSV contains zinc-finger motifs in the M2-1 protein, necessary for processivity of the viral polymerase (Hardy and Wertz 1998). The 2,2-dithiodipyridine zinc-finger reactive compound was shown to effectively inactivate RSV and conveyed moderate immunogenicity in cotton rats, which could be raised dramatically in combination with the ribi adjuvant system (RAS), an oilin-water emulsion. However, addition of this adjuvant also induced the enhanced disease, which was not observed with the inactivated RSV alone (Boukhvalova et al. 2010 ). More research would be necessary to produce a safe and immunogenicinactivated RSV, however the authors argue the superiority of zinc-finger reactive compounds over the traditional methods with respect to an unaltered protein structure and feasibility of upscaling for large scale production.",

It is argued that \u03b3-irradiation is superior to the conventional chemical methods (formalin and BPL) due to the view that organisms can be rendered incapable of replication by generating strand breaks in genetic material without structural destruction of proteins (Furuya 2012) . Furthermore, \u03b3-irradiation is associated with high penetration capacity allowing viral inactivation of large volumes, stored in closed containers, and even in frozen state. Moreover, there is no need to remove a chemical compound after inactivation (Furuya 2012) . Despite all these advantages no \u03b3-irradiated vaccine exists today, this presumably due to the success of formalin and BPL which represent wellestablished and regulatory-accepted inactivation methods, which manufacturer's may prefer for vaccine production. Furthermore, concerns surrounding the safety of \u03b3-irradiation may also have inhibited its use in the vaccine industry, however, these concerns may diminish as more research on the application of \u03b3-irradiation is increasing (Frenzen et al. 2001) . Recently, a \u03b3-irradiated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) strain has shown to convey protection against subcutaneous challenge at low doses in mice, however, despite the hypothesis that \u03b3-irradiation should not affect epitopes, a decrease in antigenicity was observed after inactivation and protection against aerosol challenge was suboptimal (Martin et al. 2010a ), nonetheless, this VEE vaccine candidate will be further pursued by the authors, as well as a formalin-inactivated counterpart (Martin et al. 2010b) .",

There are multiple licensed attenuated vaccine viruses that are currently being considered for inactivation for vaccine purposes. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) displays frequent reversion to virulence in vaccine recipients and there are estimates of approximately 400-800 vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) cases per year globally (John 2002) . Despite the immediate recognition of the fact that OPV strains can revert readily into a pathogenic phenotype (Henderson et al. 1964 ), OPV has been used since the 1960s and still is being used extensively. However, recently, it has been acknowledged that use of the oral live attenuated vaccine is at odds with global eradication of poliomyelitis. Indeed, the number of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis cases is in the range of wild-type PV induced poliomyelitis cases (WHO 2006a) . Although IPV is a safe alternative, the costs of currently available IPV are too high to implement its use in low income countries (Heinsbroek and Ruitenberg 2010; Zehrung 2010) and several options to reduce costs of IPV are being considered (WHO 2009b). In the era after eradication, IPV use will have to be continued at least for a certain amount of time. At that time, production of IPV from wild-type PV strains will fall under strict biosafety measures (WHO 2009c) . Even though it is currently not clear whether an IPV based on OPV strains may be produced at lower biosafety level after eradication as compared to a wild-type based IPV, there is much research going on to the inactivation of the OPV strains with formalin to eventually replace the inactivated PV vaccine based on the wild-type strains. Not only would the lowering of biosafety level decrease potential costs of goods, replacing the wildtype strains greatly reduces the risks of poliomyelitis upon accidental outbreaks from the manufacturing facility, after eradication. The manufacture of Sabin-IPV is essentially identical to the Salk-IPV process with slight modifications . The WHO encourages the development of this Sabin-IPV vaccine ) and multiple clinical trials have been or are being performed (Verdijk et al. 2011) , moreover, in Japan a Sabin based IPV has recently been licensed in combination with diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP-Sabin IPV) (Mahmood et al. 2013) . In general, Sabin-IPV displays higher immunogenicity for serotype 1, lower for type 2, and similar for type 3 in comparison to Salk-IPV, licensure of more Sabin derived IPV's is foreseen in the near future.",

The reason for halted development most likely lies in the only moderate immunogenicity of this candidate (Edelman et al. 1979; Steele et al. 2007 ). Research focusing on the less known alphavirus Ross River virus (RRV), which is endemic in Australia and Papua New Guinea, causing epidemic polyarthritis (Harley et al. 2001) , has lead to a phase 1/2 dose escalation study using an adjuvanted, formalin-inactivated RRV vaccine which showed high seroconversion rates in na\u00efve healthy young adults (Aichinger et al. 2011) . Another inactivated alphavirus vaccine in development is a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) inactivated vaccine, which has been studied in mice. Formalin, as well as BPL, inactivated CHIKV vaccines in combination with three different adjuvants were compared. The alumadjuvanted, BPL-inactivated vaccine induced highest antibody titers, however, all inactivated CHIKV vaccine formulations conveyed some degree of reduction in viral replication after homologous challenge (Kumar et al. 2012) .",
