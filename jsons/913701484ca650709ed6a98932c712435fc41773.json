The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting changes in society due to social distancing measures, has showcased inequities in access to decent work and experiences of discrimination resulting in many of the vulnerable populations in the United States experiencing a much harsher impact on economic and workrelated factors. The purpose of this essay is to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic may differentially affect workers of color, individuals from low-income backgrounds, and women in complex ways. First, this essay will discuss disproportionate representation of workers from lowincome and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in sectors most affected by COVID-19. Second, it will discuss the lack of decent work for low-income workers who perform \"essential\" tasks.",

This essay will discuss the ways COVID-19 has adversely affected vulnerable workers including (1) disproportionate representation of workers from low-income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in sectors most affected by COVID-19, (2) lack of decent work for low-income workers, many who come from LatinX backgrounds, (3) increased discrimination Asian Americans are experiencing in society and in the workplace, and (4) role conflict and stress for women when daycares, schools, and external resources are unavailable despite still needing to engage in paid work. Due to space restrictions, this essay is not intended to be comprehensive in nature but rather a springboard for beginning a conversation on how vocational psychologists can conduct research with direct implications for those who are most vulnerable to the economic impacts of the COVID-19",
