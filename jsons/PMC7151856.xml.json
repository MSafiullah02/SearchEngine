Over 100 RV serotypes have been identified; these are divided into major (90% of serotypes) and minor groups that use as their cellular receptor the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, respectively. RV-induced colds are closely related to social contact, and peaks are usually seen when children return to school after a vacation period. They usually cause mild disease, but one of the most prominent roles of RV is the triggering of asthma exacerbations.2 Replication is more active in the nose compared to the mouth and pharynx. RVs, however, may also replicate in the lower airway, as demonstrated with the use of molecular biology-based detection techniques.3 Although the severity of upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms after RV infection does not differ between patients with asthma and normal subjects, both the duration and the severity of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms are more pronounced in patients with asthma.4 LRT epithelial cells of asthmatics demonstrate a deficient innate immune response to RV infection, resulting in diminished apoptosis and accentuated late cytotoxicity.5,\n6 Furthermore, RV-infected LRT epithelium is a rich source of inflammatory mediators and growth factors that may trigger or propagate airway inflammation and remodeling.7\n",

Variations in the attachment glycoprotein of the viral envelope give rise to the two antigenically distinct strains of RSV, namely A and B. The majority of studies report that A strains are more common and produce more severe disease. RSV enters the body through the eye or nose and, to a lesser extent, through the mouth. The virus subsequently spreads along the airway mucosa, mostly by cell-to-cell transfer along intracytoplasmic bridges, and also through aspiration from the upper to the lower airway. RSV follows a well-characterized epidemiologic pattern, with yearly outbreaks occurring between October and May in temperate climates. In infants, maternal antibodies reach nondetectable levels at 6 months of age. At least half of the infant population becomes infected during their first RSV epidemic, and almost all children have been infected by 2 years of age. During the first infection, IgM is detected after the first week and IgG during the second week. RSV infection does not confer immunity, and re-infection is common throughout life. All immunoglobulin classes appear, and after three episodes, titers approximate those of adults.8 Although infection usually leads to mild respiratory illness, which is indistinguishable from other viral infections of the RT, some infants have more severe disease. Bronchiolitis is the characteristic clinical manifestation of such infection. There is evidence that hospitalizations for bronchiolitis\u2014now the most common reason for admission among neonates (> 125,000 per year in the United States)\u2014have considerably increased during recent decades and that hospitalized children have an increased probability of wheezing later in life (with immune status of the host probably playing an important role in the process).",

            "text": "Three types of influenza virus (IFV) have been identified; they are designated A, B, and C, and they belong to the orthomyxovirus family of viruses. They are negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses. The two IFV envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) determine both viral entry into target cells (by binding to sialic acids and fusing with cellular membrane elements) and the release of the virus. Infection with IFV occurs via respiratory droplets, and infected cells become round and swollen with pyknotic nuclei. The progressive changes in epithelial cells suggest that infection starts in the trachea and then ascends or descends. The epidemiology is characterized by yearly epidemics lasting for 6 to 8 weeks during late winter; each year, there is usually only one dominant type or subtype. Illnesses initially appear in children, among whom the incidence of infection is higher, virus shedding is prolonged, and transmission to the community is greater. Later in the epidemic, more adults are affected. Viruses are present in the community before and after the epidemic, causing illness at a low frequency. Antigenic variation readily occurs in H and N primary structures, giving rise to new subtypes (antigenic shift) and to intrasubtype changes (antigenic drift). Antibodies against H appear 2 weeks after infection and are protective for the specific subtype that caused the disease. Type A IFV has been associated with pandemics that have occurred every 10 to 40 years. Swine flu (a new subtype of IFV A H1N1) was the agent responsible for the 2009 pandemic, with higher pediatric mortality and higher rates of hospitalizations in children and young adults than in previous seasons, while asthma appeared to be a significant risk factor for developing severe disease.",

Each PIV has distinct epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, as well as different age distribution patterns. PIV 1 and PIV 2, members of the Respirovirus genus, are generally associated with laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), URT illness, and pharyngitis, whereas PIV 3, a member of the Rubulavirus genus, is also a major cause of infant bronchiolitis and is associated with the development of pneumonia in susceptible subjects. PIV 4 is rare and less well studied. PIV 1 occurs in biennial epidemics during autumn, coinciding with croup outbreaks; its peak incidence occurs in children 2 to 3 years of age. PIV 2 epidemics are less predictable; however, they more or less follow the biennial pattern of PIV 1, affecting mostly children younger than 5 years of age. PIV 3 is more frequent and infects infants < 6 months of age in yearly epidemics during spring and summer. Infection is mediated by interaction of the viral H and N glycoproteins with cellular sialic acid receptors. Protective antibodies against H and N appear early (1 to 2 weeks after infection) and persist for several years. Several infections are needed, however, for full protection. For transmission, aerosol spread is considered important, although deposition on surfaces and subsequent self-inoculation may also occur. Virus replication can occur throughout the tracheobronchial tree, causing local inflammation; however, only mild and rapidly repaired focal tissue destruction is observed in vivo. In immunocompromised hosts, fatal giant cell pneumonia may develop. Central to the pathogenesis of PIV infection is the ability of these viruses to escape interferon-mediated immune responses.9\n",

            "text": "In contrast to the rest of the respiratory viruses, adenoviruses (AdVs) are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses. This large family of viruses includes 6 subgenera and more than 50 serotypes. Their overall size is 70 to 90 nm; the virion is naked and contains 36 to 38 kb double-stranded DNA, encoding > 50 polypeptides from both strands. Some of these proteins allow efficient endosomal lysis and escape, leading to genome entrance into the host cell nucleus. The propensity of AdVs to shut off the expression of host messenger RNA and induce excess synthesis of adenoviral proteins leads to an accumulation of such proteins as intranuclear bodies, which are incompatible with normal cell function. In upper airway epithelial cells, ciliary and microtubular abnormalities lead to defective mucociliary clearance. An important feature of AdV is its ability to persist in the host for a long time, through low-grade replication, or for even longer periods, with production of adenoviral proteins without replication of a complete virus. AdVs may cause pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or conjunctivitis, while infection after solid organ or bone marrow transplantation can induce severe myelosuppression. The duration of virus isolation is 3 to 6 weeks from the pharynx or stool of children with RTI and 2 to 12 months in immunosuppressed patients. Antibodies that bind to complement appear 1 week after infection, remain for 1 year, and recognize the hexone antigen, which is common for all AdVs. Neutralizing antibodies develop against the specific serotype that caused the infection, and the titer remains stable for over a decade.",

NL63, which was isolated from an infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis, is a new group I HCV that shares 65% sequence identity with 229E.10 Human aminopeptidase N, which is present on lung, intestinal, and renal epithelial cells, has been identified as a receptor for HCV 229E. OC43 binds to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Viral replication has been demonstrated in the nasal mucosa, inducing inflammation, ciliary damage, and epithelial cell shedding, although its in vivo cytopathic effect (CPE) is not pronounced. Volunteers can be successfully infected by intranasal inoculation, although replication in the lower airway has not been confirmed. HCV causes approximately 15% of common colds, which are usually mild. In general, HCVs may cause milder LRT symptoms than other viruses, with some exceptions of more severe LRT involvement in young children and the elderly.",

Throat swabs should be collected vigorously to ensure that mucus and cellular material is obtained from the pharynx, while in older children throat gargles can be obtained. Nasal wash is shown to produce the highest viral detection rate and relatively low patient discomfort compared to swabs, aspirates, and brushings.16 Specimens should be placed in viral transport medium (VTM) in the presence of antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth. Usually this is contained in a small sterile bottle, and, after immersion, the wooden shaft of the swab is broken level with the neck of the container, the cap is replaced, and the fluid is gently agitated. VTM prevents drying and maintains viral viability during transport and contains either Eagle's minimum essential medium or Hank's balanced salt solution, along with fetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin (BSA). When the time interval between collection and delivery is less than 2 hours, specimens should be transferred to the laboratory at room temperature; when the time interval is 2 to 24 hours, they should be transferred on ice. When the time interval is more than 24 hours, specimens should be surrounded by solid CO2 and packed in an insulated container. Specimens suspected of containing RSV should not be frozen; they must be transferred to the laboratory as soon as possible. They can also be used to prepare slides for immunofluorescent detection, either by rolling the swab directly on the slide or after recovery of cells by centrifugation.",

            "text": "Immunofluorescence (IF) is based on the chemical conjugation of a fluorochrome with an antibody, without compromising either the ability of the fluorochrome to fluoresce or the specificity of the antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate are the most widely used fluorochromes; the former fluoresces yellowish-green, whereas the latter appears reddish-orange. Fluorescein isothiocyanate seems to be more suitable for clinical samples because the background is more often red than green. In addition, red-fluorescing dyes (e.g., Congo red) can be used to stain all cellular components red and provide a contrast to the green fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate. A fluorescence microscope is required for the detection of light emitted by excited fluorochrome, and the interpretation of results is partially subjective, depending on the experience of the examiner. In modern fluorescence microscopes with epi-illumination systems, light of selected wavelengths is deflected through the objective to the top surface of the sample. The resulting emitted light is directed to the observer through the objective, a dichroic mirror, a barrier filter, and the oculars. Each fluorochrome has specific fluorescence characteristics. For instance, fluorescein isothiocyanate absorption is at 495 nm, and emission is at 525 nm. With the available interference filters in fluorescence microscopes, 85% of transmitted light is between 400 and 500 nm (i.e., the visible part of the spectrum).",

However, the generation of primary conjugates for many viruses is laborious and costly, whereas secondary conjugates may be common for several antigens.

These can be accomplished within a few minutes, and they have become very popular due to their rapidity and ease of performance. Usually, a spot or slide containing the sample is prepared for every virus being tested, cytospun, and incubated with the monoclonal antibody. In a recent advance, a single spot can be used for the simultaneous detection of seven respiratory viruses (RSV, IFV A and B, AdV, and PIV 1 to 3).21 A rhodamine label is used with the RSV antibody system, whereas fluorescein is used in all other cases. Thus, the development of a reddish-gold color in the spot suggests the presence of RSV particles in the sample, whereas a green color (fluorescein) is followed by a second reaction in another spot to determine which of the other viruses is present. The sensitivity of this method was greatly enhanced by centrifugation and was superior to that of enzyme immunoassay (EIA)\u2013based protocols, but was inferior to that of cell culture.22 Another IIF method proved more efficient than cell culture in detecting respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs.23\n",

In competitive RIA methods, a known quantity of radioactivity-labeled antigen competes with unlabeled antigen that is added (test sample). The inhibition of binding of labeled antigen depends on the concentration of unlabeled antigen in the clinical sample. The labeled antigen that is finally bound to antibody is measured and referred to as bound antigen, whereas the unconjugated labeled antigen is referred to as free antigen. To circumvent problems arising from the separation of bound antigen from free antigen in solid-phase RIA, the immunoreactant that is used first (antibody or antigen) is immobilized on a solid support. After each step, unwanted reactants can be removed readily by washing. In contrast to the laborious and expensive generation of labeled viral antigens, noncompetitive RIA methods use labeled antibodies. The former are more stable, with more predictable structures and biochemical properties. Noncompetitive RIAs are, therefore, more popular in diagnostic virology. In a technique known as sandwich RIA, unlabeled viral antibodies adsorbed to a solid-phase support are allowed to capture viral antigens present in the clinical sample. Then a radiolabeled antibody (indicator antibody) is allowed to bind to the captured viral antigens. This procedure can be either direct or indirect. In the latter case, a primary unlabeled indicator antibody is used initially, followed by incubation with a secondary radiolabeled antibody. In all of these procedures, free antibody is removed after the final incubation, and bound iodine-125-labeled antibody is measured.",

Hemolysis inhibition assays take advantage of these properties to measure the presence of antibodies in a serum sample that bind and block viral antigens and inhibit hemolysis. In this way, the hemolysis inhibition assay detects both anti-H and antifusion antibodies in the serum. In a typical protocol, serum dilutions are mixed and incubated with purified virus. A 10% suspension of suitable erythrocytes is then added. After some hours of incubation, the erythrocytes are removed by centrifugation and the optical density of the \u201ccleared\u201d supernatant is read with a spectrophotometer.

The resulting single-stranded DNA would return to its double-stranded configuration on removal of the dissociation agent. The probe can be labeled directly with enzymes or other reporter molecules. Alternatively, linker moieties (e.g., biotin or digoxigenin; the latter is more sensitive for in situ hybridization [ISH]) can be attached to probes and serve as bridges for the attachment of reporter molecules. In a typical protocol, the viral nucleic acid is isolated, purified, denatured, and bound to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. The denatured and labeled probe is incubated under carefully defined conditions with the viral nucleic acid, and unbound material is thoroughly washed out.

The majority of respiratory viruses are RNA viruses; therefore, an additional step of reverse transcription (RT) is required before their PCR detection in clinical samples. First, total RNA is extracted by standard molecular biologic techniques from samples that have been kept at - 70 \u00b0 C in an appropriate virus transport medium. Alternatively, some samples may be placed directly into a denaturing solution to inactivate ribonuclease enzyme activity, and then stored or transported at room temperature. Extracted RNA is then reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA; e.g., with heat-stable reverse transcriptase isolated from a retrovirus, such as murine MoMuLV) and further amplified by PCR using virus-specific oligonucleotides (primers) that have been designed with the aid of computer software. These primers are usually planned to amplify sequences that are 100 to 1000 base pairs long (amplicons) and can be designed so that they discriminate between different serotypes of the same virus. Nucleotide diversity that is frequently observed among different strains of a given virus species should also be taken into account, and areas of high homology should be selected for serotype-specific primer pairs design. Continuous cycles of denaturation, renaturation, and extension result in an exponential accumulation of the target DNA. The reaction is limited by the availability of substrate (nucleotides) and the possible competition between the target genome and other amplicons for the reaction's reagents. The amplicons then can be electrophoresed in a 1% to 2.5% agarose gel and visualized as DNA bands under an ultraviolet transilluminator following ethidium bromide or another DNA dye staining. This is readily accomplished within 1 working day, a fact that is of particular clinical importance.",

In this approach, a second set of primers is designed against sequences that were localized internally in the sequences that were amplified in the first round. The method can be so sensitive as to detect a few particles of respiratory virus.27 Nested-type PCR may not only increase sensitivity, but it also may discriminate between serotypes within viral species that are of similar size and thus are difficult to separate with gel from the first round of PCR. Discrimination within or between species can be also accomplished by digesting the amplicons with restriction endonucleases. Human RVs, for instance, can be discriminated from enteroviruses, which lack a BglI recognition site in their respective amplified sequence, based on the fact that their product remains undigested, retaining its original size after digestion with BglI restriction endonuclease28 (Fig. 24-3\n).",

For instance, Hexaplex (Prodesse, Waukesha, Wisconsin) allows prompt detection with high sensitivity and specificity of H1N1, H3N2, IFV A, IFV B, both RSV subtypes, and three of the four human PIVs in children.29 The detection limits of multiplex RT-PCR protocols allow the identification of as few as 100 to 140 copies of viral particles/mL, or one TCID50. This method can be at least as sensitive as combined tissue culture and IF methods. Combination with hybridization may further improve detection scores. In a combination of multiplex RT-PCR and enzyme hybridization assay, the amplicons of seven respiratory viruses (RSV A, RSV B, IFV A, IFV B, PIV 1, PIV 2, and PIV 3) were purified and hybridized with peroxidase-labeled probes into avidin-coated, 96-well microplates. The signal emitted after incubation of the complex with the substrate allowed the detection of almost twice as many positive clinical samples compared with conventional culture and IIF methods.30 A multiplex PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that can detect seven respiratory viruses, in addition to the common respiratory pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, was less efficient in revealing RSV and PIV 1, although it proved to be more sensitive than cell culture in detecting PIV 3, AdV, and IFV. Recent developments in this method include semi-quantitation of results with the use of specialized equipment and primers specific for additional viral and bacterial species (e.g., Reovirus, Bordetella pertussis), allowing for the detection of as many as 19 different microorganisms in a clinical sample.31 Finally, multiplex PCR assays have been designed to discriminate between multiple subtypes within one species, as is the case with AdVs and picornaviruses.32,\n33 In another approach, degenerate primers have been used to discriminate between AdV serotypes.34\n",

Using an inkjet oligonucleotide synthesizer, these oligonucleotides are synthesized in situ and placed onto directed locations of a glass wafer.45 The glass surfaces can then be hybridized, under strict conditions, with cDNA, PCR amplicons, RNA, or another form of genetic material derived from viral stocks, virally infected cells in cultures, or clinical samples. Human and cellular transcripts are also included to normalize against nonspecific hybridization. This material is labeled with cyanin 5 or cyanin 3, which provides red or green coloring, respectively, to allow color visualization of microarray data that are obtained after the arrays are scanned with confocal laser scanners and analyzed with suitable instrumentation and software. This method allows the detection of paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, AdVs, and picornaviruses from clinical samples. It can also detect and discriminate among all 102 RV serotypes, based on the hybridization pattern obtained from each serotype. After human volunteers were experimentally infected with RV, the array could detect as few as 100 infectious RV particles in NPA samples.44 Analysis of a small number of samples from naturally acquired colds showed different RV serotypes and PIV 1, which also has been confirmed by conventional RT-PCR. Although it is extremely promising, this technique needs further evaluation, including cost-effectiveness, before being applied in clinical practice.",

In addition, PCR-based methods have proved to be very sensitive, usually exceeding the sensitivity scores of cell culture techniques. However, false-positive or false-negative findings can be a problem, if certain practical measures in the handling of viral genetic material are not meticulously followed. First, preservation of the sample is of particular importance for the integrity of the viral genomic material. RNA, the genomic material of most respiratory viruses, is particularly vulnerable to degradation by RNAses that are present in all biologic samples and fluids. RNAse-free vials, solutions, and buffers should be used by specialized personnel in designated areas of the laboratory. In addition, if it takes too long for an NPA sample to be transported from the clinic to the laboratory, or if the sample remains on ice for too many hours instead of being placed in the freezer immediately, the sensitivity of the method can be unexpectedly low. Further, biologic fluids often contain substances that can inhibit PCR amplification (e.g., mucus). In this case, dilution of the sample or treatment with a suitable agent such as dimethyl sulfoxide may facilitate detection of the virus. The use of clinical samples spiked with stock virus or the inclusion of synthetic heterologous competitor RNA in the reaction may facilitate normalization of PCR outcomes.",

The collection of nasopharyngeal wash is performed with installation of 1 to 2 mL of saline inside the nasal cavity of patients who have tilted their head backward (approximately 70%). Patients then lean forward, and the wash is collected in a sterile container or Petri dish. Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected with the help of flexible sterile swabs, which are passed through the nostrils until resistance is felt, and they are slowly rotated for 5 seconds to allow for mucus absorption.

            "text": "There are > 100 pathogens that may infect the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and produce secondary bacteremia. Additionally, invasive techniques cannot be routinely used, and sputum samples cannot be easily obtained from young children. The detection of living microorganisms in the blood of an ill child is of great diagnostic and prognostic significance, and blood culture should be considered when there is fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0 C), hypothermia (\u2264 36 \u00b0 C), leukocytosis, or fever and neutropenia (< 1000 PMN/mL). Semi-automated blood culture systems are present in nearly every clinical laboratory. Two or three separate blood cultures per 24 hours (ideally before initiation of treatment) should be collected under aseptic conditions and directly into culture bottles from every child hospitalized with pneumonia. Avoidance of transport tubes allows bacteria to begin growing immediately, decreases the amount of anticoagulant to which bacteria are exposed (anticoagulant may be inhibitory for some bacteria), and decreases the risk of needlestick accidents among health care personnel. Skin should always be disinfected with povidone iodine (must be allowed to completely dry), 70% isopropyl alcohol, or iodine prior to venipuncture to minimize contamination with skin microorganisms. Obtaining blood for culture from intravascular catheters in the absence of peripheral blood culture should be discouraged because of the frequent isolation of coagulase-negative Staphylococci and other skin flora. However, if there is no other option, the line must be adequately disinfected and flushed of all inhibitory substances before the specimen is obtained. The amount of fluid flushed from the line is based on the weight and size of the child.56 For infants, minimal discard volumes are in the range of 0.3 to 1.0 mL.57 Media-containing resins are often used to adsorb antibiotics or inhibitory substances that may be present in a patient's blood and thus improve microbial detection. In infants and young children, 1 to 5 mL/culture and in older children 10 mL/culture provide optimal recovery for the diagnosis of sepsis.58 In general, the total blood volume withdrawn for two bacterial cultures should not exceed 1% of the patient's total blood volume. Larger volumes of blood are necessary to maximize yield since 10% to 20% of pediatric patients may have low-grade bloodstream infections. Blood culture bottles that contain approximately 20 mL of broth and that accommodate an inoculation volume of up to 4 mL are available, thus allowing for a close approximation of the recommended blood-to-broth ratio necessary to diminish the effect of growth inhibitors. For the majority of patients, culture of the entire volume in a single (or additional) aerobic bottle is the most effective approach because anaerobic infections are rare among children. Patients at increased risk for anaerobic sepsis include immunocompromised children and those with infections located at areas outside the respiratory tract. Blood and tissue specimens for the diagnosis of Q fever (C. burnetii) should be frozen at -70 \u00b0 C until shipped, while clinical samples suspected of Francisella tularensis infection should be rapidly transported to the laboratory or frozen and shipped on dry ice. Prolonged incubation beyond 5 days is not necessary for automated instruments, although blind subculture may be needed if the patient is receiving antimicrobials at the time of blood collection.59,\n60\n",

See Table 24-6\nfor sensitivity and specificity of these methods. Among these, percutaneous pulmonary and transtracheal aspirates and PBB specimens are the only samples, acceptable for culturing under anaerobic conditions. BAL is collected after washing of the lower airways with normal saline, which is aspirated at low pressure (< 100 Torr) in order to avoid collapse and damage of the bronchial wall (a hemorrhagic specimen has a lower diagnostic value). For children < 20 kg, the volume of the administered normal saline is 3 mL/kg divided into 3 equal parts, and the collected specimen is considered adequate when > 40% of the instilled volume is returned back (the patient's age is usually inversely proportional to the percentage of aspirated fluid).61 Indications for BAL include hospital-acquired pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP], aspiration pneumonia); complicated community acquired pneumonia (CAP); CF; severe viral respiratory tract infections; mycobacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections; as well as pneumonia among immunosuppressed individuals. The PBB technique is applied since 1979 for collection of specimens mainly in the context of complicated bacterial CAP with introduction of a double telescopic catheter via a bronchoscope. On the other hand, saliva, oropharyngeal secretions, sinus drainage from the nasopharynx, swab samples, and 24-hour sputum collections are considered unsuitable for identification of organisms from the LRT.",

For Legionella spp., the specimen is initially diluted 10-fold in a bacteriologic broth (e.g., tryptic soy or sterile water) to dilute inhibitory substances, and because this organism grows slowly, heavily contaminated samples should be subsequently disinfected from other bacteria by 1:10 dilution in KCl-HCl pH = 2.2, irrigation, and incubation for 4 minutes only at room temperature. In CF patients, it is now necessary to cultivate sputum for Nontuberculous Mycobacteria spp. (NTM), which is performed by treatment with 0.25% N-acetyl-L-cysteine-1% sodium hydroxide-5% oxalic acid for removal of P. aeruginosa and inoculation on Lowenstein-Jensen medium or automated liquid systems.
