Incidence is rising, possibly due to greater awareness leading to more diagnoses rather than a change in the underlying rate. It arises from multiple etiologies, though pathogenic infection, termed pneumonia, is the most prevalent and widely studied. The distinct pathophysiology and rapid evolution of ARDS makes it uniquely challenging with regard to therapeutics development and, to date, no medicines are licensed for specific therapy.

The high and imminent mortality means issues such as eventual chronic fibrosis development may be secondary considerations compared to immediate restoration of lung function, specifically adequate blood oxygenation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, given as early as possible where infection is known or suspected to be present, as is support of gas exchange, usually via assisted ventilation or in more severe cases, if available, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support [18]. The core treatment of ARDS is based on supportive measures that primarily aim at gaining time to allow the antibiotic treatment or the patient immunologic system to defeat the primary cause of ARDS. Mechanical ventilation strategy includes: the use of low tidal volume ventilation, inspiratory pressure, higher positive end expiratory pressure and using prone positioning, and administering neuromuscular blockers in higher severity ARDS [19\u201321]. Current guidelines supporting protective mechanical ventilation is aimed at preventing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury [22] in patients with ARDS. The pathophysiologic reason behind this is based on the concept of the \u201cbaby lung\u201d [23], which has reduced compliance caused by the severe decrease of lung aerated volumes, and is defined based on CT scans over the course of initial ARDS diagnosis (0\u20137 days) and the subsequent fibroproliferative response (15\u201320 days) [24, 25].",

A wide variety of anti-inflammatory pharmacologicals, proteins, and antibodies have demonstrated promise in the laboratory but have failed in clinical trial (reviewed in [34]). Of relevance here is the fact that injury and repair responses are intimately linked phenomena at the cell signaling and transcriptional level, and blanket inhibition of inflammation may delay or even prevent essential regenerative processes that restore lung tissue to normal function [35\u201337]. An idealistic treatment of ARDS should target multiple mechanisms and biologic pathways instead of aiming at a single exclusive target. This hypothesis is supported by: (1) the heterogeneity of the mechanisms involved in the lung injury, (2) decades of negative randomized clinical trials with pharmacologic and other therapies and (3) the new upcoming evidences about the role of biologically distinct pathways and response to treatment in specific subsets of ARDS patients \u2013 as recently observed by the identification of specific endotypes and phenotypes [38\u201340].",

Excess alveolar fluid blocks gas exchange at the alveolar epithelial surface, while surfactant inactivation by infiltrating albumin and other substances [47\u201349] damages fluid tension leading to alveolar collapse.

            "text": "At the cellular and molecular level, the initial phase of ARDS arising from pulmonary infection involves resident pulmonary macrophage defenses being overcome, and the epithelial cell layer lining the alveolus begins to produce proinflammatory cytokines [50]. These signals initiate the recruitment of circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and B-cells, to migrate up a chemokine concentration gradient to the lung tissue, where these cells release matrix metalloproteinases that enzymatically digest connective tissue facilitating entry to the airspace [51]. Recruited infiltrating cells produce a wide range of noxious substances including superoxide radicals [52\u201358], leukotrienes [59\u201364], and antimicrobial peptides [65\u201367] and further cytokine cocktails in an attempt to destroy the infectious agents. In ARDS, a section of these substances is uncontrolled and induce damage to the lung tissue itself leading to fluid buildup and surfactant loss. Finally as the alveoli fill with liquid and the integrity of the epithelial and endothelial barrier is compromised, gas exchange deteriorates and hypoxemia and hypercapnia result. In later phases of ARDS during systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), patients may suffer from functional immune-suppression and have heightened susceptibility to additional infection [68\u201370]. While ARDS presents an acute onset after the exposure to the causing factor, its evolving process starts with acute exudation and infiltrates of acute inflammatory cells into the alveoli within 1 week. During the second week a subacute deposition of collagen fibers are produced by fibroblasts. The syndrome typically resolves through a chronic stage characterized by alveolar macrophage infiltration into the alveoli and a fibrotic repairing process of the lung parenchyma [11].",

Fluid balance was normalized by the decrease of the extravascular lung water, restoring the alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and by improvement of lung endothelial barrier permeability. The alveolar epithelial fluid transport was in part coordinated by the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), secreted by the MSCs, which restored the correct function of the amiloride-dependent sodium transport.",

In 2014, it was observed in a follow-on study that intravenous administration of clinical-grade allogenic human MSCs could increase the AFC at 4 h. The role of KGF in the AFC was confirmed by the study of a neutralizing antibody of KGF that could decrease the AFC activity [94]. Recently, the same group explored the effects of microvesicles (MVs) released by human mesenchymal stem cells in their established ex vivo human lung perfusion model of bacterial pneumonia. The investigators reported positive results highlighting the beneficial effects of MSC MVs in increasing lung antibody forming cells, in decreasing the lung permeability, and improving the bacterial clearance, particularly when MSCs were pretreated before isolation of MVs with a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) [95].",

It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to alveolar epithelial cells improved survival after endotoxin injury [118], while in a rat model of COPD, iPS-derived MSC mitochondrial transfer to bronchial epithelial cells was also observed [126]. MSCs have been shown to transfer mitochondria to macrophages in vitro and in vivo, improving macrophage function and enhancing phagocytosis [127]. In a mouse model of E. coli-induced pneumonia it was reported that therapeutic effect was dependent on transfer of MSC mitochondria to alveolar macrophages through TNT, enhancing antimicrobial activity and phagocytosis [128]. While it is unclear whether the mechanism of action in vivo is due to an enhancement of a normal mitochondrial function or restoration of dysfunctional mitochondria, there is some evidence for damaged mitochondrion, e.g., downregulated NDUFB8 (complex I) and ATP synthase (complex V), in ARDS meaning the latter is a distinct possibility [129, 130].",

            "text": "Freeze-thawed MSCs, in comparison to cells harvested from continuous cultures, have diminished immunomodulatory properties as well as a reduced responsiveness to proinflammatory cytokines [140]. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs is affected by cryopreservation, launching a heat shock protein response [141]. In vivo experiments have shown that cryopreserved are less well tolerated. In a clinical application where predominant indications included graft versus host disease (GvHD) and tissue injury in hemorrhagic cystitis, therapeutic properties of freeze-thawed and freshly harvested MSCs were compared. A 100% response rate was observed in patients treated with fresh cells at a low passage compared to patients treated with cryopreserved freeze-thawed cells at a higher passage, with cryopreserved MSCs eliminated faster by compliment after exposure to recipient blood [140]. The thawing process can damage cell surface proteins and this abnormality attracts the binding of complement initiating clearance by phagocytosis [142\u2013144]. After complement exposure, there is an 80% decrease in cell viability in cryopreserved cells compared to a 50% decrease in fresh MSCs [141, 145]. However activation of complement may not be negative as recognition of opsonized MSCs are hypothesized to induce an M2 phenotype, producing anti-inflammatory mediators [140]. Macrophages can display various phenotypes, with the two being described as M1 and M2. M1 phenotypes are generated by the classical pathway [146, 147] and produce abundant inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-12, and reactive oxygen species. M2 phenotypes are generally activated by the alternative pathway and express a variety of lectins, protein, and scavenger receptors [146\u2013148].",

Additionally, there is currently no data published on whether there is an upper limit on MSC population doubling that still retains therapeutic efficacy. Kern et al. compared the senescence ratio of AT-MSC to BM-MSC and found that BM-MSC had a growth threshold of passage 7, whereas AT-MSC had a threshold of 8 [154], but efficacy itself may be lost long before senescence arises. In addition, MSCs isolated from patients with advanced age [155, 156], diabetes [157], rheumatoid arthritis [158], or indeed ARDS itself [159] have decreased activity, including lower regenerative and differential potential and therefore autologous MSC therapy in patients with significant chronic comorbidities may not be a promising approach in any case. Downregulation of inflammatory marker receptors may render MSCs isolated from such patients less responsive to the injury microenvironment and hence of lower overall therapeutic value [146, 147, 159].",

There are also, variations in age related to DNA methylation levels, which is correlated to differential abilities, with ESC-derived iPSC having a higher proliferation and regenerative capacity [166, 167]. However, caution is still required as genetic abnormalities remain an area of concern in iPSCs [168]. Clinical studies using iPSCs found some cells in the study contained genetic abnormalities, and were consequently not used. Cells taken from elderly patients to be reprogrammed for administration can come with increased risks of genetic abnormalities [168], demonstrating the need for screening of cells before infusion if autologous cells are ever to be used in elderly patients.",

We are far from being able to claim MSC therapy is a viable option for ARDS. However, during the last decade, promising preclinical evidence supports the hypothesis of a potential benefit in treating ARDS patients with MSCs [169]. Despite the many studies into the potential clinical benefit of MSCs in ARDS that have been proposed over the last years and posted on clinicaltrials.gov, most of them are still currently ongoing or they lack a status update. Furthermore, few studies have disclosed the initial safety results (Table 12.1). The first clinical trial where MSCs were used to treat ARDS was reported in 2014 (NCT01902082), where Zheng and coworkers administered 1 \u00d7 106 AT-MSCs/kg of body weight or saline in a 1:1 fashion in 12 patients with moderate and severe ARDS. The investigators reported that the administration of allogeneic MSCs was feasible and safe with no infusion toxicities or serious adverse events related to MSCs in the treatment group and with no differences in terms of adverse events and biomarkers of lung injury between the MSCs and the placebo group [170].",

A suite of effectors produced by MSC cultures, or indeed by similar cell types engineered to replicate or improve upon the MSC secretome while being more open to manipulation and expansion, could replace cell therapy entirely. Also, as alluded to already, these factors will be likely easier to analyze, store, and deliver than the MSC they are derived from. Presuming cell-contact dependent mechanisms such as TNTs are the sole means underlying the MSC\u2019s efficacy in ARDS, we may ultimately see an MSC product cocktail available in stable, off-the-shelf format that can be delivered IV or intra-tracheally by nebulizer that will reproduce the efficacy initially demonstrated with the IV-delivered cryopreserved whole cell.",

Despite gradual improvement in supportive care for the patient, specific therapies have proven elusive. The MSC is an exciting prospect, as it is a real paradigm shift from traditional approaches, due to its ability to respond to the level and nature of injury, having both direct and immunomodulatory properties, and a multimodal mechanism of action that targets multiple pathologies seen in the ARDS patient. Issues around dosing, MSC production, and potency reproducibility remain but are being addressed. We look forward to the conclusion of the many current and planned clinical trials to determine the true therapeutic potential of MSCs for those suffering from this devastating disease.",

Right side: during injury, protein-rich edema fluid and inflammatory cells permeate the alveolus. MSCs have been demonstrated to alleviate the pathophysiological symptoms of ARDS through the secretion of paracrine factors, cell-to-cell contact and mitochondrial transfer (TNT and EV release). Indirect and direct contact of MSCs has been shown to reduce the permeability of alveolar epithelium and increase fluid clearance. Through the secretion of ANG-1, endothelial and epithelial repair is increased. Reduction of neutrophil migration also improves endothelial and epithelial barriers. Release of KGF promotes an increase in alveolar fluid clearance. Bacteria clearance is achieved through the direct release of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 or through increased phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages mediated by the release of cytokines including FGF-7 or by transfer of micro vesicles through TNTs. Mitochondrial transfer to epithelial cells also increases surfactant release. A few mechanisms of action of MSCS in ARDS have been displayed in this diagram.
