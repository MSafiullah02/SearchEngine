The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. Whereas at the beginning of the outbreak, cases were connected to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, efficient human-to-human transmission led to exponential growth in the number of cases.

The best of these compounds (11r; Fig. 1 ) showed an EC50 of 400 picomolar against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells as well as low micromolar EC 50 values against SARS-CoV and a whole range of enteroviruses in various cell lines, although the antiviral activity seemed to depend to a great extent on the cell type used in the experiments (6) . In order to improve the half-life of the compound in plasma, we modified 11r by hiding the P3 -P2 amide bond within a pyridone ring (Fig.  1 , green circles), in the expectation that this might prevent cellular proteases from accessing this bond and cleaving it. Further, to increase the solubility of the compound in plasma and to reduce its binding to plasma proteins, we replaced the hydrophobic cinnamoyl moiety by the somewhat less hydrophobic Boc group (Fig. 1 , red circles) to give 13a (see scheme S1 for synthesis).",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (M pro , 3CL pro ), due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the X-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M pro and its complex with an \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. Based on the structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route. the target, we determined the crystal structure, at 1.75 \u00c5 resolution, of the M pro of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2) . The threedimensional structure is highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV M pro , as expected from the 96% sequence identity (see fig. S7 ); the r.m.s. deviation between the two free-enzyme structures is 0.53 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 positions (comparison between SARS-CoV-2 M pro structure and SARS-CoV M pro , PDB entry 2BX4 (7)). The chymotrypsin-and picornavirus 3C protease-like domains I and II (residues 10-99 and 100-182, respectively) are six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrels that harbor the substrate-binding site between them. Domain III (residues 198-303), a globular cluster of five helices, is involved in regulating dimerization of the M pro , mainly through a salt-bridge interaction between Glu 290 of one protomer and Arg 4 of the other (8) . The tight dimer formed by SARS-CoV-2 M pro has a contact interface, predominantly between domain II of molecule A and the NH 2 -terminal residues (\"N-finger\") of molecule B, of ~1394 \u00c5 2 , with the two molecules oriented perpendicular to one another (Fig. 2) . Dimerization of the enzyme is necessary for catalytic activity, because the N-finger of each of the two protomers interacts with Glu 166 of the other protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket of the substrate-binding site (9) . To reach this interaction site, the N-finger is squeezed in between domains II and III of the parent monomer and domain II of the other monomer. Interestingly, in the SARS-CoV but not in the SARS-CoV-2 M pro dimer, there is a polar interaction between the two domains III involving a 2.60-\u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residue Thr 285 of each protomer, and supported by a hydrophobic contact between the side-chain of Ile 286 and Thr 285 C\u03b32. In SARS-CoV-2, the threonine is replaced by alanine (indicated by the black sphere in Fig. 2 ), and the isoleucine by leucine (see fig. S7 ). It has previously been shown that replacing Ser 284 , Thr 285 , and Ile 286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV M pro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the protease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer against one another (10) . This was accompanied by changes in enzyme dynamics that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic center. Indeed, the Thr 285 Ala replacement observed in the SARS-CoV-2 M pro also allows the two domains III to approach each other a little closer (the distance between the C\u03b1 atoms of residues 285 in molecules A and B is 6.77 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV M pro and 5.21 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV-2 M pro and the distance between the centers of mass of the two domains III shrinks from 33.4 \u00c5 to 32.1 \u00c5). However, the catalytic efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 M pro is only slightly higher, if at all (k cat /K m = 3426.1 \u00b1 416.9 s \u22121 M \u22121 ) than that of SARS-CoV M pro (k cat /K m = 3011.3 \u00b1 294.6 s \u22121 M \u22121 ). Further, the estimated K d of dimer dissociation is the same (~2.5 \u00b5M) for the two enzymes, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation ( fig. S8 ). We used this crystal structure to dock the \u03b1-ketoamide 13a; this suggested that the pyridone ring might have some steric clash with the side-chain of Gln189. However, in our previous work (6), we had found Gln189 to be quite flexible and therefore we went ahead with 13a as a lead. The plasma half-life of this compound in mice was increased ~3-fold compared to 11r (from 0.3 hours to 1.0 hours), the in-vitro kinetic plasma solubility was improved by a factor of ~19 (from 6 \u00b5M for 11r to 112 \u00b5M for 13a) and the thermodynamic solubility by a factor of ~13 (from 41 \u00b5M to 530 \u00b5M). Binding to mouse plasma protein was reduced from 99% to 97% (many drugs have plasma protein binding of >90%; (11) ). However, compared to 11r (IC50 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M), the structural modification led to some loss of inhibitory activity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 = 2.39 \u00b1 0.63 \u00b5M) as well as the 3C proteases (3C pro ) of enteroviruses. 11r was designed for broad-spectrum activity, with the P2 cyclohexyl moiety intended to fill a pocket in the enterovirus 3C pro . The S2 pocket of the betacoronavirus M pro (see Fig. 3 ) features substantial plasticity enabling it to adapt to the shape of smaller inhibitor moieties (6) . To enhance the antiviral activity against betacoronaviruses of clade b (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV), we sacrificed the goal of broadspectrum activity and replaced the P2 cyclohexyl moiety of 13a by the smaller cyclopropyl in 13b (Fig. 1, blue circles) .",

One structure is in space group C2, where both protomers of the M pro dimer are bound by crystal symmetry to have identical conformations, the other is in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , where the two protomers are independent of each other and free to adopt different conformations. Indeed, we find that in the latter crystal structure, the key residue Glu 166 adopts an inactive conformation in protomer B (as evidenced by its distance from His 172 and the lack of Hbonding interaction with the P1 moiety of the inhibitor), even though compound 13b is bound in the same mode as in molecule A. This phenomenon has also been observed with the SARS-CoV M pro (12) and is consistent with the halfsite activity described for this enzyme (13) . In all copies of the inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M pro , the inhibitor binds to the shallow substrate-binding site at the surface of each protomer, between domains I and II (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "Through the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys 145 onto the \u03b1-keto group of the inhibitor, a thiohemiketal is formed in a reversible reaction. This is clearly reflected in the electron density (Fig. 3 inset) ; the stereochemistry of this chiral moiety is S in all copies of compound 13b in these structures. The oxyanion (or hydroxyl) group of this thiohemiketal is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from His 41 , whereas the amide oxygen of 13b accepts a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amides of Gly 143 , Cys 145 , and partly Ser 144 , which form the canonical \"oxyanion hole\" of the cysteine protease. It is an advantage of the \u03b1-ketoamides that their warhead can interact with the catalytic center of the target proteases through two hydrogen bonding interactions (6) , rather than only one as with other warheads such as aldehydes (14) or Michael acceptors (15). The P1 \u03b3-lactam moiety, designed as a glutamine surrogate (15, 16) , is deeply embedded in the S1 pocket of the protease, where the lactam nitrogen donates a three-center (bifurcated) hydrogen bond to the main-chain oxygen of Phe 140 (3.20/3.10/3.28 \u00c5; values for the structure in space group C2/space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 molecule A/space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 molecule B) and to the Glu 166 carboxylate (3.35/3.33/(3.55) \u00c5), and the carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.57/2.51/2.81-\u00c5 H-bond from the imidazole of His 163 . The P2 cyclopropyl methyl moiety fits snugly into the S2 subsite, which has shrunk by 28 \u00c5 3 compared to the complex between compound 13a with P2 = cyclohexyl methyl and the SARS-CoV M pro (17) . The pyridone in the P3 -P2 position of the inhibitor occupies the space normally filled by the substrate's main chain, its carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.89/2.99/3.00-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the main-chain amide of residue Glu 166 . Further, the P3 amide donates a 2.83/2.96/2.87-\u00c5 H-bond to the main-chain oxygen of Glu 166 . Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no longer donate a hydrogen bond to the protein (the H-bond prevented from forming would connect the P2 nitrogen and the side-chain oxygen of Gln189; these two atoms are highlighted in fig. S8 ). However, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2 main-chain amide of the linear \u03b1ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases, so this interaction does not seem to be critical (6) . The protecting Boc group on P3 does not occupy the canonical S4 site of the protease (in contrast to the protecting groups of other inhibitors in complex with the SARS-CoV M pro (18) ), but is located near Pro 168 (3.81/4.17/3.65 \u00c5; Fig. 3 ); due to this interaction, the latter residue moves outward by more than 2 \u00c5 (compared to the structure of the free enzyme). This contact explains why removing the Boc group as in compound 14b (Fig. 1, purple circles) weakens the inhibitory potency of this compound by a factor of about 2. Interestingly, there is a space between the pyridone ring of 13b, the main chain of residue Thr 190 , and the side-chain of Gln 189 (smallest distance: 3.6 \u00c5) which is filled by a DMSO molecule in the C2 crystal structure and a water molecule in the P2 1 2 1 2 1 structure. This suggests that P3 moieties more bulky than pyridone may be accepted here.",

            "text": "To assess the absorption -distribution -metabolismexcretion (ADME) properties of the pyridone-containing \u03b1ketoamides, we first investigated compound 13a. Metabolic stability in mouse and human microsomes was good, with intrinsic clearance rates Clint_mouse = 32.0 \u00b5L/min/mg protein and Cl int_human = 21.0 \u00b5L/min/mg protein. This means that after 30 min, around 80% for mouse and 60% for humans, respectively, of residual compound remained metabolically stable. Pharmacokinetic studies in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous route at 20 mg/kg showed that 13a stayed in plasma for up to only 4 hours, but was excreted via urine for up to 24 hours. The Cmax was determined at 334.5 ng/mL and the mean residence time was about 1.6 hours. Although 13a seemed to be cleared very rapidly from plasma, it was found at 24 hours at 135 ng/g tissue in the lung and at 52.7 ng/mL in broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) suggesting that it was mainly distributed to tissue. Next, we investigated 13b for its pharmacokinetic properties in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous route as well, but at 3 mg/kg. ADME parameters of 13b were similar to 13a; in addition, the binding to human plasma proteins was found to be 90%. The Cmax of 13b was determined at 126.2 ng/mL. This is around 37% of the C max detected for 13a, although 13b dosage was approximately 7-times lower. The mean residence time for 13b was extended to 2.7 hours and the plasma halflife in mice was 1.8 hours. In addition, 13b showed a less rapid clearance compared to 13a (table S3) . During the pharmacokinetic study with 13b, we monitored its lung tissue levels. After 4 hours, around 13 ng/g 13b were still found in lung tissue. This lung tropism of 13a and 13b is beneficial given that COVID-19 affects the lungs. In addition to subcutaneous administration, 13b was nebulized using an inhalation device at 3 mg/kg. After 24 hours, 33 ng/g 13b were found in lung tissue. Inhalation was tolerated well and mice did not show any adverse effects, suggesting that this way, direct administration of the compound to the lungs would be possible. Given these favorable pharmacokinetic results, our study provides a useful framework for development of the pyridone-containing inhibitors toward anticoronaviral drugs. Data and materials availability: Crystallographic coordinates and structure factors are available from the PDB under accession codes 6Y2E (unliganded M pro ), 6Y2F (complex with 13b in space group C2), and 6Y2G (complex with 13b in space group P212121).
