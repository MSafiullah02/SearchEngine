            "text": "In recent years, nanomedicine has become an attractive concept for the targeted delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic compounds to the lung (Dames et al., 2007, Foldvari and Elsabahy, 2011). Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and increase the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs, thereby resulting in improved efficacy and reduced drug toxicity (Kim et al., 2010, Koo et al., 2005, Singh, 2010). Nanocarriers are particularly designed to target inflammation and cancer that have a permeable vasculature. Among the various drug delivery systems considered for pulmonary application, the use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles represent several advantages for the treatment of respiratory diseases (Bailey and Berkland, 2009, Buxton, 2009). A number of different strategies have been proposed for modification of nanoparticle characteristics to control their behavior within biological environments, like cell-specific targeted drug delivery or modified biological distribution of drugs, both at the cellular and organ level. This method of delivery is particularly attractive for inflammatory conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Accordingly, we have harnessed unique attributes of three novel, long-acting, biocompatible, and biodegradable antiinflammatory nanomedicines. They consist of two amphipathic peptide drugs, human glucagon-like peptide-1(7\u201336) amide (GLP-1), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1) peptide and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a water-insoluble cytotoxic drug. This innovative approach consists of self-assembly of each drug with U.S. FDA-generally regarded as safe (GRAS) distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine covalently linked to polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 2000 (DSPE-PEG2000), a component of U.S.FDA-approved Doxil\u00ae, that forms long-acting, biocompatible, and biodegradable, sterically stabilized phospholipid nanomicelles (SSM) in aqueous milieu (size, \u223c 15 nm; Rubinstein and \u00d6ny\u00fcksel, 2007, Sadikot et al., 2008a, Sadikot et al., 2008b, Sadikot et al., 2009).",

They are simple to prepare and, unlike liposomes, can be stored in lyophilized form without lyo- or cryo--protectants for extended periods of time. Nanomicelles stabilize TREM-1 peptide and GLP-1 in active biological form (\u03b1-helix) which is preferred for ligand\u2013receptor interactions and prevents rapid peptide degradation in vivo, thereby prolonging bioactivity (Al-Sabah and Donnelly, 2004, Alana et al., 2006. In addition, SSM solubilize high concentrations of 17-AAG. Unlike surfactant micelles, the low critical micellar concentration (\u223c 1 \u03bcM) of these nanoparticles prevents their disintegration upon dilution in biological fluids. Importantly, the PEG2000 moiety of SSM confers steric hindrance in the circulation, while their nanosize mitigates renal clearance and extravasation from intact microvessels. This, in turn, prolongs the circulation time of drug-loaded nanomicelles and promotes preferential extravasation from hyperpermeable lung microcirculation, the hallmark of ALI, into the injured lung.",

Passive targeting occurs as a result of extravasation of the nanoparticles at the diseased site where the microvasculature is leaky (Pison et al., 2006). Examples of diseases where passive targeting of nanocarriers can be achieved are tumor and inflamed tissues. Microvascular leakiness in ALI and ARDS is the result of increased permeability, and the presence of cytokines and other vasoactive factors that enhance permeability (Matthay and Ware, 2000). Thus, drugs used for treatment of ALI and ARDS can be administered systemically and will localize to the lungs by passive targeting. This innovative, passively targeted therapeutic strategy amplifies drug delivery to the lung thereby maximizing efficacy and enhancing resolution of inflammation while reducing collateral damage to innocent bystander organs as occurs in patients with ALI and ARDS.",

Passive targeting occurs due to extravasation of the nanoparticles at the diseased site where the microvasculature is leaky (Liu et al., 2009). Examples of diseases where passive targeting of nanocarriers can be achieved are tumor and inflamed tissues. Leakiness in ALI/ARDS is the result of increased permeability and the presence of cytokines and other vasoactive factors that enhance permeability. Thus, agents used for treatment of ALI/ARDS can be administered systemically and will localize to the lungs by passive targeting.",

The large surface area of the lungs and the minimal barriers impeding access to the lung periphery make this organ a suitable portal for a variety of therapeutic interventions (Beck-Broichsitter et al., 2010, Bur et al., 2009, Buxton, 2009). The blood\u2013barrier between the alveolar space and the pulmonary capillaries is very thin to allow for rapid gas exchange. Alveoli are small and there are approximately 300 million of them in each lung. Although alveoli are tiny structures, they have a very large surface area in total (\u223c 100 m2) for performing efficient gas exchange, making it an attractive organ for direct drug delivery (Rudolph et al., 2010, Smola et al., 2008). Among the various drug delivery systems considered for pulmonary application, nanoparticles demonstrate several advantages for the treatment of respiratory diseases, such as prolonged drug release, cell-specific targeted drug delivery, or modified biological distribution of drugs, both at the cellular and organ level (Azarrmi et al., 2008, Bailey and Berkland, 2009, Pison et al., 2006, Sung et al., 2007, Yang et al., 2008). Nanoparticles composed of biodegradable polymers fulfill many requirements placed on these delivery systems, such as ability to be transferred into an aerosol, stability against forces generated during aerosolization, biocompatibility, targeting of specific sites or cell populations in the lung, release of the drug in a predetermined manner, and degradation within an acceptable period of time (Rytting et al., 2008, Schleh et al., 2011, Yacobi et al., 2008). Further studies are needed to establish the role of aerosolized nanopreparations for inhalational therapy.",

As with inflammatory processes elsewhere in the body, lung inflammation is accompanied by many cellular and biochemical processes; some of them specific to the syndrome and includes injury to both the pulmonary capillary endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The importance of ALI has been highlighted by the emergence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). ALI and ARDS are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (Matthay and Ware, 2000). The major reason underlying the lag in improvement in outcome is the lack of novel and specific therapies for ALI and ARDS (Matthay, 2008).

We selected molecules that initiate and propagate inflammatory response by distinct mechanisms so that multiple pathways can be targeted either singly or by a combinatorial approach as in diseases like HIV (Shey et al., 2009). Among these TREM-1(Bouchon et al., 2000, Bouchon et al., 2001), ROS, and Hsp90 were initially selected to modulate the inflammatory response in the lung (Sadikot et al., 2004, Sadikot et al., 2008a, Sadikot et al., 2008b.",

Likewise, water-insolubility of 17-AAG, a selective Hps90 inhibitor, constrains its use in humans. Accordingly, self-association of 17-AAG with these micelles overcomes this limitation while at the same time increasing its stability and bioavailability. These long-acting micellar drugs provide significant advancement in the treatment of experimental of ALI which could then be extended to critically ill patients. Nanoparticles can be introduced by systemic administration (oral, dermal, intravenous, etc.) or directly introduced into the lung through inhalation, intranasal, or oropharyngeal aspiration.",

In vivo administration of GLP1-SSM to LPS-induced ALI mice resulted in significant downregulation of lung inflammation, with dose-dependent antiinflammatory activity observed. Similar therapeutic activity was not detected for GLP-1 in saline, indicating that the SSM nanocarriers played a critical role in protecting the enzyme-labile GLP-1 and delivering it to inflamed tissues in vivo. This study demonstrated for the first time that the lipid-based nanoformulation of GLP-1 is effective at attenuating inflammation in ALI/ARDS (Lim et al., 2011). We have also tested the efficacy of TREM-1 nanomiceller peptide in a model of LPS-induced sepsis and lung injury and shown that TREM-1 nanomicelles are more efficacious than the naked peptide at abrogating inflammation (Sadikot et al., 2008a, Sadikot et al., 2008b). Studies with other nanomiceller preparations such as 17-AAG for treatment of ALI/ARDS are currently ongoing in our laboratory. Together, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of translating the use of these nanomiceller preparations for translational human studies to the clinics to treat this devastating disease. We hypothesize that combinatorial administration of nanomicelles that modulate distinct signaling pathways will prove to be more potent, however, will need further studies to optimize the administration of the nanopreparations.",

Nanomedicine, the medical application of nanotechnology, promises an endless range of applications from biomedical imaging to drug delivery and therapeutics. These novel approaches using nanotechnology are revolutionizing the future of medicine. Advances in nanotechnology are proving to be beneficial in therapeutic field such as drug discovery, drug delivery, and gene/protein delivery. Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, designed as multifunctional engineered nanoparticles, appear to be particularly attractive and promising for drug delivery to organs such as the lung since they combine several opportunities like uniform distribution of drug dose among all ventilated alveoli allowing for uniform cellular drug internalization. Besides sustained release of drugs in plasma and organs, other potential advantages of the system include the possibility of reduction in drug dosage, adverse effects, and drug interactions. Although the field of nanomedicine offers multiple opportunities, it still is in its infancy and the research has to proceed in order to obtain a specific targeting of the drug combined with minimum side effects. Ongoing studies offer several exciting prospects for the application of engineered nanomaterials for drug delivery in years to come.",
