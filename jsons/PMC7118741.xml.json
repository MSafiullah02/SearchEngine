In May 1999, the World Health Assembly\u2014the governing body of the WHO\u2014unanimously passed WHA52.18, a resolution to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) to draft and negotiate a framework convention on tobacco control and a working group composed of WHO Member States to undertake preparatory work for the INB.",

Starting in the 1990s, China aimed to redefine its place in the international system; it now wished to be viewed not as a rule breaker or a challenger, but as an internationally responsible power that actively engages in international affairs, even though moving in this direction entailed acceptance of more restraints on its sovereignty.4 Driven by the new sense of accountability and commitment, many Chinese officials and scholars supported the \u2018sacrosanct principle\u2019 that public health concerns should be given precedence over tobacco-related trade.5 Secondly, China was also hoping to use the FCTC to maintain the dominant status of domestic tobacco firms by blocking trade liberalization in tobacco production and curtailing tobacco smuggling by transnational tobacco companies.6 Both of these factors might explain why China was among the 59 countries pledging financial and political support for FCTC while the Member States were voting for WHA52.18.",

Externally, because the convention would be a treaty, which only state actors can join by definition, China was concerned that Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, might use the negotiations as an way to expand its international space and pursue a \u2018two China\u2019 or a \u2018One China, One Taiwan\u2019 agenda.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) was the primary central ministry supporting strong tobacco control. It had a champion at the WHO to support its tobacco control cause \u2013 a Chinese public health expert named Yang Gonghuan \u2013 who happened to be working in the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. But to the surprise of all the other participating countries, which did not allow the tobacco industry to officially participate in the negotiations, the Chinese delegation included a representative from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA). Unlike its regulatory counterparts in other countries, STMA shares its management staff with the China National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC), a state-owned manufacturer of tobacco products and also the world's largest cigarette maker. This unique governance arrangement made STMA the de facto representative of China's giant tobacco industry.",

Furthermore, in the single-minded pursuit of economic growth in post-Mao China, public health has often been relegated to a backburner issue. As a result, the MOH is bureaucratically weak and often has to rely heavily on interagency cooperation to accomplish its policy goals.10 By contrast, the economic clout of the STMA/CNTC have placed it in a strong position to lobby and influence policy. Beginning in 1987, tobacco has provided the biggest single source of tax revenue in China. In 2002, the tobacco industry generated 8% of China's annual fiscal revenue through taxation; in Yunan Province, the share was as high as 49%.11\n",

On the one hand, he stressed the importance of the tobacco industry, saying that \u2018For a long time, Chinese economic development will depend on the tobacco industry to accumulate fiscal revenue and to partially solve the employment issue.\u20198 On the other hand, he noted that as a responsible power, China should support tobacco control. Yet, a compromise between the MOH and the STMA/CNTC was difficult to reach not only because of the tobacco industry's fundamental conflict of interest with public health, but also because of the MOH's lack of leverage in the interdepartmental bargaining process. Perceiving the FCTC as a threat to China's tobacco industry, the STMA formed a working group to study the treaty and proposed counter-strategies for the Chair's Text from INB3 through INB6 in early July 2001.12\n",

Starting in March 2004, the WHO convened regional meetings and two IGWG meetings to negotiate the IHR revisions. The work was completed in May 2005, immediately prior to the 58th WHA, which adopted the revised IHR by acclamation.

In addition to the involvement of non-state actors in disease surveillance, the IHR introduces the universality principle, which states that the implementation of the regulations \u2018shall be guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease\u2019 (Article 3.3).",

Meanwhile, the crisis also provided an opportunity for China to update its conception of national sovereignty.

Premier Wen Jiabao, for example, admitted that the cross-boundary spread of a disease like SARS could \u2018only be effectively countered by cooperative efforts at the regional and international levels.\u201920 Even though it was considered one of the most ardent supporters of state sovereignty, China, especially in the later stage of the SARS outbreak, appeared to have acquiesced to WHO's leadership on global health governance.21 These developments prompted China to actively participate in the IHR revision. In sharp contrast to India, which sent only three delegates to each of the three IGWG meetings, China sent 12 delegates in November 2004, 15 in February 2005, and 17 in May 2005.22 The relatively large delegation size enabled China to have enough negotiators to cover concurrent sessions, \u2018corridor negotiations\u2019 and other processes.",

Further, none of the agencies appeared to stand to lose from the revised IHR. For the MOH and the AQSIQ, the new requirements of building core surveillance and response capacities might lead to increased workload, but they could also be used to justify significantly more central budgetary investments, which would boost their morale and status in the bureaucratic hierarchy. Equally important, the MOH was entrusted to \u2018take the lead\u2019 (qiantou) in the negotiations. Neither of the other two members were bureaucratically strong enough to challenge the MOH's lead role, especially over technical issues; the AQSIQ had a lower bureaucratic rank than the MOH and the MFA, and the MFA traditionally has little autonomy in the foreign policy process.23 The delegation of the first two IGWG meetings, however, was headed by Sha Zukang, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations office in Geneva, who was noted for his outspoken nationalist tones.",

Prior to the revision of the IHR, the reporting of disease outbreaks and the nature of responses to them was solely the domain of sovereign states. However, individual states were incentivized to suppress the flow of information regarding endogenous epidemics that are of international concern. For example, the Implementing Regulations on the State Secrets Law regarding the handling of public-health related information classified any occurrence of infectious diseases as a state secret before it was announced by the Ministry of Health or organs authorized by the Ministry.24 China initially argued vehemently against the proposal to include a formal list of specific infectious diseases for fear that it might be compelled to reveal information that would hurt its national interests. China also resisted the idea of sending WHO investigative teams to countries without consent.25 This emphasis on state sovereignty led to a state-centric approach to domestic health governance that excludes the participation of NGOs. In spite of the growing recognition of the importance of non-state actors in disease surveillance (which the revised IHR acknowledges), China maintained that sovereign states should remain the primary actors in implementing the IHR. Similar to what its stance in the FCTC talks, China, along with many other Asian countries, also sought to limit the role of NGOs in the IGWG meetings.",

During the IGWG meetings, however, China continued to block Taiwan's request to become a signatory party of IHR. In November 2004, Nicaragua proposed an amendment that would allow non-member states to participate as signatory parties to IHR, but this amendment was rejected by Member States.

China will firmly defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all cost.\u201926 Playing China's sheer population size as a trump card, he further warned that \u2018the future IHR has no universality without China's participation.\u201926\n",

In both cases, China demonstrated strong incentives to participate in the negotiation of legally binding international rules. This growing interest in global health governance has been driven by its aspiration to be a responsible power as well as the need to defend its core national interests in international relations. This interest in global health governance, coupled with the recognition of its role as a critical stakeholder in addressing major global health challenges (i.e., tobacco use and PHEIC), also exerted sufficient normative pressures for China to be more flexible and constructive in global health rule making. This is especially true after the 2003 SARS outbreak, which reinforced the incentives for China to accept restraints on its state sovereignty and become more cooperative in handling transnational challenges. Such normative pressure may explain why China has ratified both FCTC and the revised IHR despite their potential negative impact on state sovereignty.",

In contrast, \u2018big tobacco\u2019 appeared to have played a less prominent role in influencing US positions in the FCTC talks, even though it might have contributed to the US failure to ratify the treaty.30 Domestic political economy was not found to be a significant factor when China was negotiating IHR revision.
