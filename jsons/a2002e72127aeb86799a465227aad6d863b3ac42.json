Technological advancements are transforming how healthcare knowledge is expanding and accelerating the outreach of critical medical services delivery (Jamal et al. in Health Information Management Journal 38(3):26-37, 2009). While this transformation facilitates new opportunities simultaneously it also introduces challenges (Jacobzone and Oxley, 2001) . Appropriate Health Technology (HT) is vital to new and existing global health care programs. Therefore, qualified professionals who can safely guide the development, evaluation, installation, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation of HT must be in position to lead. Trained Clinical Engineers (CE) and Biomedical Engineers (BE) have been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the essential practitioners to providing this critically needed guidance. Over the past four years, a senior professional group participated in an international project that seeks evidence for the hypothesis -that the engagement of CE and BE in guiding HTimpacts positively on patient outcomes, while the alternative is that there is no difference. adoption of a resolution to investigate CE contributions to the improvement of world health status, an international survey and literature survey were initiated. During the first two years of this project 150 case studies from 90 countries were identified covering the previous ten years. The results of this survey were presented to health leaders at the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Assembly in 2016. Last year, 250 case studies were added including 35 more countries covering the 2016-2017 period. The combined project contains 400 qualified submissions from 125 countries. The conclusion was that engagement of CE and BME is critical for successful investment in HT and for achieving intended patient outcomes. This paper describes the project's plan, the results of the literature review performed, and the evidence identified during the process.",

The dependence of health, rehabilitation, and wellness programs on technology for the delivery of services has never been greater [3] . Therefore, it is essential that health technology (HT) be strategically guided and optimally managed [4] . Guidance can only be provided by educated and experienced professionals who can safely lead the full life cycle of the technology, starting with innovation and progressing to development, regulatory compliance, evaluation, installation, training, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation. However, these professionals must be familiar with the relationship between contributions from HT and their impact on patient outcomes. The understanding of this relationship is a fundamental requirement for achieving optimal return on investment and improvement of outcomes. Such practitioners are critical members of the healthcare team and should be in position to facilitate technology-related plans.",

The flood of scientific and technological innovation is radically redefining the nature of healthcare in virtually every dimension, from vascular nanoengineered interventions and predictive diagnostic tests to image guided surgery and remote telehealth-based services at the national and global levels. However, most healthcare systems are not adequately staffed to safely and effectively manage these forces of change. Most systems are structured around vertically-expert professions (medical doctors, medical physicists, nurses, administrators), but lack the \"horizontal expertise\" that trained Biomedical and Clinical Engineers (BE&CE) provide. For example, the expertise in assessing and managing the integration and the performance of complex smart systems that have varying areas of service, durations of technological lifecycle [5] , hardware and software platforms, and middleware in support of integrated medical and surgical services.",

This allowed us to answer the question whether their participation contributed to improvement in overall healthcare outcomes. In the field of HT management and CE, the incentives to publish studies are lower than it should be, resulting in limited volume of resources to develop best practice measures. Despite these perceived limitations, our results were recently published [3] .

Our data answers these concerns. If the knowledge and the expertise of the global CE community does have a critical role in optimal guidance of HT deployment, how can that expertise be best demonstrated. The collection of the case studies (that were later called success stories) from all over the world can facilitate the determination if there is competency unique to CEs around the world that leads the development and optimal management of these technology life cycles. Having this knowledge can help to reach better understanding of the required strategy to achieve desired patient outcomes when technology is used in care and rehabilitation management.",

Low resources countries in particular face a challenge of improving their health services because, in addition to the above stated challenges, they also have scarce availability of professional expertise trained to address technology-related issues [7] . Varied availability and state of infrastructure and human resources place higher demand on adequate management of HT innovation and deployment. The effective health workforce of the twenty-first century consists of more individual practitioners caring for complex health-issues and thus charged with deploying the most optimal benefits from medical technology, such as proper selection, effectiveness, timely access, and affordable. In academia, government, and industry, teams of BE&CE translate design innovations and integrate knowledge of science, engineering, standards and regulations with clinical strategy to create new tools that save and improve lives while building more quality into patient outcomes. In hospitals, BE&CE practitioners ensure that proper acquisition, installation, integration and operation of devices and systems are safe and efficient.

The group identified the volume of published data that and developed criteria for inclusion pertinent and qualified publications. The rules are shown in Fig. 1 below. Several conditions were placed on the total volume of publications and formal presentations that were found. Only sources that responded positive to the challenge of the criteria were included in the final examination. To begin with, the source must be subjected to peer-review screening. Secondly, the source must include care-related outcomes in the body of the manuscript, thirdly the source had to be published in IFMBE [10] sponsored publication or event (meeting) proceedings, fourthly, the source must describe how CE or BME practices led to the second criterion of outcomes, and the fifth criterion limit the source inclusion to specific window of time. This window was defined as 2005-2015 for the first phase of this examination, and 2016-2017 for the second phase.",
