Most die immediately, but this may change with the increase of EBW usage. With conventional HEs, the blast wave decays very rapidly and is affected significantly by the environment. Enhanced-blast weapons produce a lower overpressure than conventional HE, but the period of overpressure lasts longer and reaches farther, thereby increasing the lethality zone and producing blast casualties farther from the epicenter of the detonation ( Figure  3 -2). The classic EBW mechanism is illustrated best in the FAE, which has an initial small explosion that disperses a vapor cloud of ethylene oxide or other fuel. At a critical time and distance, the dispersed fuel is ignited by a second detonation, producing a uniform dynamic overpressure through the covered area. This may produce lethal overpressures as high as 2 Mpa, whereas a conventional HE would produce only 200 Kpa at a similar distance from the initiating explosion. The EBW also produces a longer-lasting fireball and may produce more energy [area beneath the curve ( Figure  3 -2)], resulting in more casualties with primary blast injuries combined with burns, crush, and penetrating-fragment injuries. 48 T.W. Baskin and J.B. Holcomb The blast wave from an EBW can diffract around corners, rapidly expanding and filling a structure, and is enhanced by reflection in enclosed spaces, making this an ideal weapon to defeat field defenses, soft unreinforced buildings, communication equipment, and low-flying aircraft. As an antipersonnel weapon, an EBW can be expected to rapidly produce large numbers of casualties with burns, blast injuries, fragment, translational injuries, and crush injuries from demolished buildings, placing a sudden and intense clinical and logistical strain on medical resources.",

Armor-employing decouplers or layers of material with different acoustic and mechanical properties specifically designed to maximally attenuate the shock wave needs to be designed. It is the combination of the shock wave or leading edge, the dynamic overpressure, the secondary and tertiary effects, and the associated thermal energy that result in the characteristic injuries seen following detonation of an explosive device.

Various ventilatory strategies have been proposed to lessen such risk, including Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and volume-controlled ventilation with low tidal volumes and permissive hypercapnia. Prophylactic tube thoracostomy should be considered if casualties must be evacuated by air or when close observation is impractical.",

Cripps identified those lesions at greater risk of perforation in experimental studies in pigs, suggesting that serosal lesions greater than 15 millimeters in the small intestine and greater than 20 millimeters in the large bowel are at higher risk of perforation and should be resected.

Triage and appropriate patient distribution may be the most critical piece of patient management. Combined blast and penetrating injuries are almost always the most life threatening and the basic principles of the ABCs should always be adhered to. Blast lung may not present for 24 to 48 hours; therefore, all patients requiring early mechanical ventilation or those going immediately to the operating room should be managed with low tidal volumes of 5 to 6 milliliters per kilogram of ideal body weight, peak inspiratory pressures of less than 25 centimeters H 2 O, allowing for permissive hypercapnia. If associated TBI is present, hypercapnia should be avoided or minimized, if possible, due to the deleterious effects on intracranial hypertension. For a patient undergoing anesthesia with obvious signs of blast lung injury, there is an increased risk of barotrauma with resultant tension pneumothorax. The authors recommend consideration of bilateral prophylactic tube thoracostomy.",

Since World War II there have been 36 documented cases with only four deaths. The deaths occurred not from the detonation of the missile, but from the moribund condition of the casualty, usually due to hemorrhage. The M79 grenade launcher (40 mm), mortars, and RPG missiles have been the most commonly reported cause of retained ordnance. A fuse or detonator that can be triggered by impact, electromagnetic energy, or time and distance normally detonates this type of ordnance. There is often a safety built into the device requiring a defined number of revolutions or a required distance and time before the missile is armed to explode. The RPG round must travel a proscribed distance before the fuse is armed to trigger on impact. All missiles that have been fired must be considered armed, and a defined and predetermined algorithm for the care of the casualty and the safety of the medical personnel should be followed.",

These patients should be isolated and, in a mass casualty situation, should be treated last as the removal of ordnance is time consuming and the surgeon must attend to other casualties before placing his or herself at risk. Closed chest massage or defibrillation should never be attempted, and during removal, any equipment emanating electrical energy, heat, vibration, or sonic waves, such as the electrocautery, ultrasound, blood warmers, or power instruments, should be avoided. The patient should be placed in a protected area away from the main hospital, and all personnel in the immediate area should employ body armor or explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) equipment. Explosive ordnance disposal personnel should be involved prior to removal to help with identifying the round and fuse; a plain radiograph will help in planning the operative removal and will not cause the round to explode. The minimum anesthesia required should be used and in such a manner that the anesthesia provider need not be present during actual removal. The only personnel required during removal are surgeon and an assistant-ideally, EOD personnel. The round should be removed en bloc without touching the missile with metal instruments. Every effort should be employed to maintain the orientation of the missile until removed from the area by EOD. The basic guidelines for removal of ordnance are outlined in Table 3 -5.",
