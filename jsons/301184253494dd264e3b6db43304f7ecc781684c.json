Global mergers ensued, expanding the research of R&D organizations quickly into new territories. The rise of China as an emerging market for health care and pharmaceuticals has attracted much pharma R&D investment in the mid-2000s. As a result, the top pharmaceutical companies today have R&D locations in all major markets, not just for the coordination of local clinical development projects but also for discovery research.",

Science and technology-related factors are concerned with R&D personnel qualification, knowhow sourcing and regional infrastructure. These factors are largely outside the direct influence of R&D but necessary for its fundamental operations, such as the proximity to universities or the R&D environment. Proximity to markets and customers, improvements of image and collaborations are notable sales & output efficiencyrelated factors. Efficiency-related criteria focus on the costs of running and the critical mass of R&D units, as well as efficient hand-over processes between R&D and other corporate functions. Direct cost advantages (such as the often-publicized labor costs) rarely influence the internationalization of R&D in the long run, but other efficiency-oriented factors such as costs of coordination and transfer, and critical laboratory size do have an even bigger impact on international R&D organization. Direct costs may become more important in the coming years as the other factors improve in low labor cost countries.",

Even though small size is a driver for internationalization, the global marketing reach of large firms facilitates the leverage of global R&D and innovation. For instance, when Pfizer acquired Wyeth and Merck acquired Schering-Plough in 2009, on paper the two merged firms would have accounted for 51% of the total U.S. pharmaceutical R&D spending and 39% of total world-wide spending (Comanor and Scherer 2013). Subsequent cost reduction programs eliminated R&D units in the combined companies, but since both domestic and foreign units were closed down, this had little effect on their new extent of R&D internationalization. Rather, we (2002) 7.1 Trends in R&D Internationalization observed a centralization of R&D in certain internationally leading regions of innovation (centers of excellence). However, mergers are rarely driven by scientific or technological reasons. Access to new markets and economies-of-scale effects are primary drivers for mergers. Nevertheless, the resulting R&D conglomerate must somehow come to terms with a new and more international organization.",

Host country restrictions, such as local content requirements, tolls, import quota, and fulfillment of standards, can attract R&D into key market countries (pull regulations): Both the U.S. and China have plenty of such regulations attracting inbound R&D investments from overseas. On the other hand, home country restrictions may induce companies to move R&D abroad (push regulations): European regulations caused biotechnology R&D to be transferred to the U.S., and lack of homegrown talent forced Swiss pharma companies to set up R&D centers abroad.",

China (especially Shanghai and Beijing) and India (especially Mumbai and Bangalore) are catching up as locations for research, too. The trend of research concentration is even more apparent when only foreign research locations are considered: almost 90% are in the triad regions of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. \u2022 Although the main regional centers for development largely coincide with the regional centers for research, development is more evenly distributed among European countries and the Northeastern United States, and extends into Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa, and South America.

Transnational R&D projects are managed more easily if the R&D network consists of competence centers (pharmaceutical firms tend to be ahead in reorganizing themselves around competence centers), given that complementary competencies are provided locally. With increasing complementarities of resources, competencies, and knowledge bases, as well as the division of labor and specialization of work, synergy potentials in R&D projects can be exploited.

Pharmaceutical companies also seem to internationalize research as fast as development (albeit for different reasons). Most other industries tend to keep research at home and localize development. Although not obvious from location data alone, pharmaceutical companies also tend to organize R&D as competence-based networks, as opposed to R&D hubs (e.g., automotive and chemicals), polycentric networks (e.g., local market-dependent companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell) or centralized R&D (e.g., dominant design industries). In competence-based R&D networks, each R&D node has a clearly defined competence-and responsibility!-which it brings into the network of other R&D centers. The coordination and management of such R&D networks is more demanding and costly than rather centralized and directive R&D hubs, or the laissez-faire style of polycentric R&D networks. As a consequence, pharmaceutical companies (and many electrical and IT companies, who also favor this type of R&D organization) try to coordinate R&D activities across multiple levels, including the deployment of transnational project teams, platform management, informal as well as formal network techniques.",

They serve a worldwide counterfeit market estimated to exceed US$24 billion in 2014 alone (Philipp 2014), with 79% of counterfeit pharmaceuticals seized by U.S. authorities in 2008 coming from China. The situation is complex to control: In addition to the almost 5000 Chinese companies involved in medicine manufacturing, there are 400,000 retail pharmacy shops, and 29,000 firms involved in shipping medical products (Philipp 2014). China lacks effective regulatory control over the manufacture and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Chemical manufacturers only need to register with the CFDA if their product is intended for medical use. The CFDA has no authority to regulate them if they declare otherwise, and the CFDA does not monitor or inspect APIs intended for export (ITA 2016) . For many Chinese companies, the term 'R&D' refers mainly to the production of additional generic products particularly for China-in terms of strengths, dosage forms and even specific compounds (Webber 2005). As of 2016, what constitutes a \"new drug\" was still of unclear definition and subject to policy debates (ITA 2016).",

Pharmaceutical multinational firms that already have R&D centers in those emerging markets are well positioned to leverage their reach into different population groups not only as patient pools but also as sources of innovation, and ultimately may play an important role in acting as conduits of reverse innovation in their home countries.",

It moved to Hangzhou when the local municipal government picked up the expiring HGP funding. In 2002, it sequenced the rice genome, and in 2003 it decoded the SARS virus genome and developed a detection kit. It moved to Shenzhen as the first citizen-managed, non-profit research institution in China in 2007, and in 2008 published the first complete human genome of an Asian individual. In 2010 it established offices in Cambridge (Mass.), and Copenhagen. In 2013 it worked with 17 of the top-20 pharmaceutical companies, and later that year bought Complete Genomics, based in Mountain View, California. In addition to research offices in all the major cities in China, it also has research collaborations or centers at UC Davies in California, Vancouver, Philadelphia, and Hong Kong, as well as a genetic testing facility in Prague, Czechia. BGI has lowered the price for a complete human genome to under US$3000, is the world's largest gene sequencer, and is now regarded as one of the most advanced high-tech startups from China. WuXi PharmaTech is a biopharmaceutical R&D services firm headquartered in Shanghai. Founded in 2000, WuXi established services in synthetic chemistry in 2001, manufacturing process development in 2003, research manufacturing in 2004, bioanalytical services in 2005, service biology in 2006, and toxicology and formulation in 2007. In addition to opening several Chinese facilities, WuXi acquired the U.S.-based AppTec Laboratory Services in 2008, gaining expertise in medical device and biologics testing and facilities in St. Paul, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. As part of its continued internationalization, it also acquired Abgent, a San Diego-based manufacturer of antibodies for biological research and drug discovery, in 2011. WuXi also has R&D facilities and labs in Cambridge (Mass.), Plainsboro, Munich, Reykjavik, and in Israel and Korea. By end of 2016, WuXi had 14,000 employees in 26 R&D sites that served 2000 corporate clients.",

Patients often pay much of the cost of treatment themselves, thus deferring treatment until the condition is very severe 5 Undeveloped private sector Negative attitudes towards private healthcare, which makes it very difficult for the private sector to attract good doctors, who feel the public hospitals offer them better career progression opportunities 6 Slow drug approvals CFDA backlog: In 2015, over 18,000 drug applications had yet to be reviewed. Worse for foreign pharma: Phase III trials to be conducted in China regardless of where the product was previously launched 7 Medical tourism and gray market imports Drugs are expensive in China, and often available much later than abroad. E.g., drugs are the most purchased items by Chinese tourist in Japan 8 Scrutiny on international companies China's anti-corruption initiatives make pharma companies very tentative when operating in China. Compliance with China specific regulations-including anti-commercial bribing and anti-unfair competition law, is critical 9 Preferential conditions for domestic players China's domestic pharma are not only less subject to the restrictive compliance regulations but also given preferential access to drug lists-such as the National Essential Drug List (NEDL) 10 Limited access to time-poor physicians Time for physicians to engage with medical reps or educate themselves on new treatments is extremely limitedespecially important in a country that values personal connections ('guanxi') 11 TCM Cmpetition 203 of the 520 compounds on the 2012 edition of the NEDL were TCMs 12 Economic slowdown For patients, economic slowdown means everything costly becomes even costlier.
