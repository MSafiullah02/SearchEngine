Generally, they have spicules of silica or calcium carbonate embedded in their bodies for support and fibrous skeletons made of a horny substance called spongin; however, either or both of these may be lacking. Because sponges lack a distinct enteron and the germ layers are not well established, the phylum Porifera is sometimes classed in a separate subkingdom, the Parazoa, or the Metazoa.",

Sponges obtain feed by propelling water through tiny pores in the body wall, thus capturing microorganisms and organic detritus that may be present in their body. Further the sponges inhabit several millions of symbiotic organisms, particularly microorganisms which are producing many biologically active substances for their successful survival in sponges which are also taking part in it. Because of this reason, there is a debate among the researchers about the source of these biological substances. Thus the sponge as a whole contributes to show a variety of biological activities, including antimicrobial, anticancer, and also reported to have toxic materials (Table 9.1).\n",

The surface is microconulose, and the texture is compressible and flexible. This species is dark brown/black, in colour, externally and tan inside and is generally found in sheltered reef habitats, under ledges or in caves. It is fairly rare despite its broad range of distribution in the South and Indo Pacific.",

The above macrolides showed the following in vitro activity against B16 melanoma cell lines: norhalichondrin A \u2013 0.0052 \u03bcg/ml; halichondrin B \u2013 0.000093 \u03bcg/ml; homohalichondrin A \u2013 0.00026 \u03bcg/ml; halichondrin C \u2013 0.00035 \u03bcg/ml and homohalichondrin B \u2013 0.0001 \u03bcg/ml. Halichondrin B showed good in vivo activity against B16 melanoma in mice (T/C values of 203\u2013244 %, depending on dose (5\u201320 \u03bcg/kg) and regimen), against P388 leukemia in mice (T/C 323 % @ 10 \u03bcg/kg), and against L1210 in mice (T/C 207\u2013375 % with doses of 50\u2013100 \u03bcg/kg under various injection schedules). From the results, it was concluded that it is important for antitumor activity that the tricyclic ring be relatively lipophilic and that the terminal group have two or more hydroxyls, but not a carboxylate. Halichondria are massive, amorphous sponges with clearly separated inner and outer skeletons consisting of bundles of spicules arranged in a seemingly random pattern.",

(1987b) isolated spongiadiol (Fig. 9.49), epispongiadiol (R1 + R2 = O, R3 = OH, R4 = H), and the new isospongiadiol [2\u221e, 19-dihydroxyspongia \u2013 13(16), 14-dien-3-one] (R1 = H, R2 = OH, R3 + R4 = O) from the deep-water Caribbean sponge Spongia sp.. Both antiviral activity and cytotoxicity were reported for all the three spongiodiols. In vitro assays against HSV-1 revealed a spectrum of activities ranging from the very active spongiadiol (IC50 = 0.25 \u03bcg/ml) to the modestly active epispongiadiol (IC50 = 12.5 \u03bcg/ml), with isospongiadiol exhibiting intermediate activity (IC50 = 2.0 \u03bcg/ml). Further the studies on antitumour and antiviral activities of these three furanoditerpenoids, spongidiol and isospongiadiol gave 100 % inhibition on HSV-1 plaque formation at 20 and 0.5 \u03bcg/(6 mm disk), and epispongiadiol gave partial inhibition at 12.5 \u03bcg/ml (Kohmoto et al. 1987b).",

But only very few of them are available as potent drugs in the market which are being superseded by the synthetic ones. This may be because of the non-availability of source materials for the continuous supply of such biologically active compounds. Further this acts as a limiting factor for the pharmaceutical companies to go for patenting. So the pharmaceutical companies prefer the synthetic compounds to get continuous supply after launching their product in the market. However, it is not that much easy to synthesize, economically, some of the natural products, since they have more complex structure. Hence, further research is needed to find out the ways and means to synthesize the more complex marine natural products.",
