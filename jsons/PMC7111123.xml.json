Neonatal infection by Clostridium perfringens type C (Table 1\n) is widely recognized [7], and, like other infections by toxin types of C. perfringens, type C may colonize rapidly in the absence of established normal flora [6]. Robust, hearty calves, usually less than 10 days of age, develop hemorrhagic, necrotic enteritis and enterotoxemia, often with abdominal pain [8], [9] and nervous signs. Death may be peracute, or following a clinical course of several days.",

Insufficient attention has been given to the possible action of alpha toxin in the gut. Furthermore, production of other potential virulence factors might set apart groups of isolates associated with specific syndromes which are now considered to be idiopathic. It is also possible that strains normally resident in the gut produce the observed infections, when anarchic multiplication follows nutrient spillover into upper small intestine.",

Disease is sometimes compatible with the action of a hemolytic toxin in the circulation, causing intravascular hemolysis and capillary damage, inflammation, platelet aggregation, shock, and sometimes-fatal cardiac effects [6], [37]. Alpha toxin can sometimes be found in the intestinal contents of animals with naturally occurring enteric disease, and is an important factor in pathogenesis of myonecrosis [30]. Little is known of the permeability of the intestine to alpha toxin, but it may be a virulence factor in cases of presumed enterotoxemia [1], [34]. The recently described beta2 toxin [38] may participate in pathogenesis of bovine enteric infections [39]. However, our findings suggest that only 14.3% (8/56) of isolates from calves with a similar syndrome were cpb2 positive, and only 50% of these express CPB2 (our unpublished results).",
