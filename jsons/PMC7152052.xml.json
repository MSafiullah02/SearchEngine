The definition of an antibacterial bioactive material is a material possessing the activity to destroy bacteria or suppress their growth or their ability to reproduce. Over the past several years, infectious disease management has become an increasing challenge for physicians. Management of bacterial infection has become difficult due to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. There has been an alarming increase in the number of resistant Gram-positive organisms over the last 5 years. These Gram-positive organisms include: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Reports from several centralized agencies that follow bacterial resistance trends indicate that the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has increased from 25 to 37% and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) from 35 to 65% in the last 3 years alone. These resistant organisms represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). However, the problem of resistant Gram-positive organisms is not limited to the hospitalized patient. Outpatients have also been affected, with the emergence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), a cause of community-acquired pneumonia [1].",

Organic antimicrobial additives are compounded into the polymer, where they diffuse to the surface and destroy microorganisms by interfering with enzyme activity. As antimicrobial additive at the surface is used up or washed away, additive from the polymer matrix continues to come to the surface, providing extended performance [54,55]. The strongest growth is for inorganic, silver-based biocides, with recent utilization in a broad range of polymers, applications and functions [53].",

This is because the nanopar- ticles, immobilized in the gel matrix, can exert their antimicrobial activity by simple contact with the bacterial membrane, while they are not taken up and internalized by eukaryotic cells.

In the USA alone, the annual cost for the symptomatic treatment of dental infections in 1977 was estimated at over $11 billion, increasing to about $24 billion in 1984 and $34 billion in 1990 [4]. It was also reported that the infection rate of total joint arthroplasties is in the range 0.5\u20135% among over half a million implants used in the USA alone [86,87]. The complication of infected implants quite often leads to surgical intervention at high health and social cost. For example, it was estimated that treatment of each single episode of infected arthroplasty costs over $50000 [88]. Bone cements with antibiotics have been widely accepted in clinical use, as shown in Table 5.2\n[89]. Other than bone cements with antibiotics, coatings containing antibiotics in orthopaedics devices are also used clinically. For example, gentamicin, which has a relatively broad antibacterial spectrum, has been loaded on polymers for coating titanium implants [90,91]. In addition, other antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra, for instance, cephalothin, carbenicillin, amoxicillin, cefamandol, tobramycin, and vancomycin, have been used in coatings on bone implants [91], [92], [93], [94].",

Routine excision of infected peripheral arterial grafts and vascular reconstruction with extra-anatomic conduits are associated with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 30% and amputation rates of up to 70% [95]. Clinical data have reported that in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis has been accomplished successfully in a small number of patients and shows promising early results. Advances in the management of infected vascular prostheses over the last decade have led to improved mortality and decreased amputation rates with conventional excision and extraanatomical bypass.

A multicentre clinical study further demonstrated that the InterGard Silver graft is safe with no side effects. The primary patency rate was excellent, and the graft infection rate was low, despite a high incidence of nosocomial infections [100]. A comparison to show the efficacy of collagen silver-coated polyester and gelatin-sealed grafts with rifampin-soaked vascular grafts to resist infection from MRSA and Escherichia coli was carried out. The results indicate that collagen silver-coated grafts and gelatin-sealed grafts, both soaked in rifampin, provide resistance against MRSA and E. coli. There was a trend toward better resistance but without statistical significance against E. coli from the rifampin silver graft compared with the rifampin-soaked Gelsoft graft, without signs of inflammation from InterGard silver grafts [101].",

For example, the use of silver is increasing rapidly in the field of wound care, and a wide variety of silver-containing dressings are now commonplace, as reported in section 5.3.1 (wound care). However, concerns associated with the overuse of silver and the consequent emergence of bacterial resistances are being raised. In a review by Percival et al.\n[105], it is stated that although resistance to heavy metals, such as Ag+, has been studied and reported, exact mechanisms are not known and there is little current evidence of emerging microbial resistance to silver. Unlike in the case of antibiotics, resistance to antiseptics, such as Ag +, is rare and sporadic. Certainly, with widespread use of Ag+ in wound care, more potential pathogens are going to be exposed to this agent. With the knowledge that silver-resistance genes exist sporadically in certain types of bacteria, it would be appropriate for future studies to determine the actual prevalence of these genes within clinical and environmental settings. Currently, knowledge is limited. Therefore, it is advised that the best approach is to keep hygiene emphasized in wound care and use wound dressings with antibacterial materials targeted towards those applications which have demonstrable benefits [106].",

For example, in a recent published paper reviewing the clinical evidence of use of ActicoatTM dressings in burns, there is evidence to suggest that ActicoatTM has improved bacterial clearance compared to other silver-containing dressings. It is easy to use, and has sustained release of silver, allowing less frequent dressing changes. This combined with its low toxicity levels make it a possible ideal dressing for burn wounds. However, despite the wide use of ActicoatTM in burns, the available evidence regarding its use in burns is weak, with only one study considered to be (level of evidence) LOE 1. More well-designed and properly reported, randomized, controlled trials are essential for informed clinical decision making [107].",

However, it should be stressed that it does not necessarily follow that as a result of antibacterial protection, these surfaces are no longer vulnerable to infection, and that conventional cleaning methods can be compromised, as the contamination is usually associated with the soiling of that surface with dirt, food, or bodily fluids. An \u2018ideal\u2019 in-dwelling medical device surface should have the same surface properties as that of a healthy living body, which would resist bacteria adherence, kill bacterial, and promote the growth of living tissues, but such in-dwelling medical devices are difficult to manufacture.
