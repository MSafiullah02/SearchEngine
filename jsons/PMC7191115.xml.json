            "text": "The pathogenicity of viral infections can be affected by host's circadian clock system via two different mechanisms [9\u201311]: (i) direct regulation of viral replication within target cells and (ii) indirect effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, BMAL1, one of the key regulators of the circadian oscillator, directly affects mouse herpesvirus infection in cultured cells and herpes virus replication is significantly enhanced in cells lacking BMAL1 molecule [12]. Conversely, acute infection with mouse herpes virus increases BMAL1 expression, which consequently deranges or enhances cell-autonomous rhythms depending at what point in the circadian cycle the infection takes place. Absence of BMAL1 affects the expression of cellular factors involved in protein biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum function and vesicular trafficking, all of which are important elements in intracellular replication of coronaviruses [13]. Similarly, BMAL1 and REV-ERB\u03b1, the nuclear receptor family intracellular transcription factor required for synchronising and maintaining the peripheral clock [14], influence multiple steps in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, including its ability to enter hepatocytes as well as the RNA genome replication of the virus within hepatocytes. Knock-out approaches of Bmal1 or genetic over-expression or increased REV-ERB activity using synthetic agonists markedly reduce the replication of not only HCV but also other flaviviruses, such as Dengue and Zika viruses, through disruption of lipid signalling pathways [15].",

When mice were infected with herpes virus at various time-points of the day, significant effects were ascribed to the circadian clock [16]. Thus, the circadian clock appears to influence both the infectivity of viruses as well as their ability to replicate inside the host. Furthermore, we surmise that since the circadian clock machinery is intrinsically involved in the regulation of angiotensin pathways, particularly in the transcriptional expression of ACE2, an imputed role for the circadian clock in regulating the infectivity to SARS-CoV-2 is highly probable [17].",

It has been shown that an endogenous circadian clock within lung epithelial cells modulates neutrophil recruitment through the chemokine ligand CXCL5 [21]. Genetic ablation of BMAL1 in the bronchioles resulted in a disruption of CXCL5 expression rhythms, leading to exaggerated inflammatory responses upon LPS stimulation. Depletion of BMAL1 also resulted in increased morbidity, mortality and virus replication in mice due to a lack of circadian regulation of interferon expression. Importantly, environmental disruption of circadian function by an experimental chronic jet lag model resulted in disrupted temporal expression of BMAL1 in the lungs and increased weight loss after respiratory Sendai virus infection [22].",

Mice infected at the beginning of their active phase showed higher mortality than those infected at the onset of rest phase. These temporal differences were abolished in mice lacking BMAL1 expression. Interestingly, heightened inflammation was observed in mice infected at the onset of active phase, while the number of natural killer cells was significantly higher in the group infected just prior to the rest phase, suggesting that circadian regulation of innate immunity plays a major role in these differences. Indeed, depletion of NK cells abolished the time of day differences, indicating that the molecular clock controls host cell responses to influenza virus infection via NK cell functions.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 exhibits high affinity to tissue ACE2. Under normal circumstances, ACE2 is responsible for the inactivation of Angiotensin II (ATII) and therefore plays among other functions, an important role in endothelium and cardiovascular homeostasis [27]. Indeed, The ACE-Ang II-AT1R pathway is called the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway, and regulates sympathetic nervous system tension, cause vasoconstriction, increase blood pressure, and promote inflammation, fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy, while the ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas proto-oncogene receptor-based axis is viewed as the counter-regulatory RAS pathway, and antagonises the effects of the classical pathway [27], yet also serves as the tissue receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is present in several cellular substrates in the body, but is particularly abundant in the vascular endothelium including the pulmonary vasculature, which may explain the predilection of SARS-CoV-2 to the lung. In this context, several hypotheses have been raised revolving around the overall effect of ACE1 or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on COVID-19 infections. Putative beneficial results would consist of ACE2 receptor blockade, thereby restricting the viral entry load into organs such as the lungs, and modulation of inflammatory response by these pharmacological agents. However, a potential retrograde feedback mechanism leading to up-regulation of ACE2 receptors cannot be excluded. As such, notwithstanding the a priori beneficial effects of ACE1/ARB on SARS-CoV infection, we cannot extrapolate them to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Furthermore, when conditions such as aging, systemic hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases are present, increased ATII levels lead to lower ACE2 activity, and increased inflammation, and could position such patients at increased risk for deterioration of their underlying disease and more severe adverse outcomes due to inactivation of the already reduced ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 [28].",

Importantly, ACE2 functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensin II (AngII) at its C-terminus and creating vasodilating angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang(1\u20137)) [7]. A lack of ACE2 is associated with increased lung injury upon acid aspiration, and this detrimental effect was markedly ameliorated in mice genetically lacking the lung epithelial angiotensin II receptor 1a [30]. Further, administration of recombinant ACE2 protected ACE2-deficient as well as wild-type mice from the acute lung injury. Thus, AngII functions as proinflammatory mediator while Ang(1\u20137) exhibits anti-inflammatory functions [6]. As the expression of ACE2 is reduce in aged individuals, its dual function as SARS-CoV2 entry receptor and as the enzyme that converts proinflammatory AngII into anti-inflammatory Ang(1\u20137) may account for the less frequent infection with SARS-CoV2, but more severe disease outcome in older individuals [6].",

Further, levels of ACE expression in the heart show distinct diurnal changes [32] and AngII induces changes in the expression of circadian genes in vascular cells [33], while changes in BMAL1 expression also affect the expression of angiotensinogen and resting blood pressure in perivascular adipose tissues [34] Thus, it is conceivable that lung expression of ACE2 will also manifest circadian changes through cell autonomous regulations and through indirect effects of circadian changes in renin-angiotensin system. Considering that the more severe manifestations of SARS-Cov-2 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition characterised by enhanced vascular permeability in the lung [35, 36], it would be important to also consider the role of the pulmonary endothelium and its cognate expression of ACE2 as a potential target for the virus-induced ARDS [37, 38]. Of note, a putative adjuvant role for melatonin has been recently proposed for ARDS in the setting of SARS-Cov-2 infection [39]. Furthermore, the higher propensity for COVID-19 to manifest in obese patients and in males, might be also explained by the significant inter-dependent role played by ACE2 in obesity [40\u201343], and the downstream systemic inflammation induced by this highly prevalent condition [44], and the sexual dimorphism of such effects [45].",

Indeed, extensive literature has indicated the important role of homeostatic sleep in innate and adaptive immunity [46]. Furthermore, there are clear reciprocal dependencies between sleep duration and quality and the immune responses against viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens, the latter altering in turn sleep patterns [46]. Thus, it is likely that improved sleep quality and duration in the population may mitigate the propagation and severity of disease induced by SASRS-Cov-2 infection. Interestingly and potentially relevant to the SARS-Cov-2-ACE2 pathophysiological interdependency, Carhan et al. observed in a drosophila model that adult flies lacking ACER (an ACE2 homologue in Drosophila melanogaster) or those treated with peptidase inhibitors experienced disrupted night-time sleep [47]. We are unaware of any specific studies examining the effects of sleep on SARS-Cov-2 infection. Nonetheless, we should remark that coronaviruses are found with increased frequency in the tonsillar tissues of children suffering from obstructive sleep apnea [48].",

            "text": "As mentioned above, it is unclear how disrupted or insufficient sleep may affect SARS-Cov2 infection rates and the severity of its clinical manifestations. Typical symptoms of acute lung injury (ALI) include dyspnea, hypoxemia and pulmonary edema which may deteriorate into the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The cell-based pathological mechanisms of such progression involve activation of immune-inflammatory cascades resulting in disruption of the alveolar- capillary barrier [38]. This immuno-inflammatory activation is influenced by the circadian clock, and therefore deregulation of circadian rhythms such as in night shift workers or social jetlag could play a disease-specific role by altering the susceptibility to infection or modifying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 syndrome. It would be of paramount importance to establish the prevalence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population while ensuring that adequate information regarding their sleep habits and circadian activities would be appropriately incorporated. Furthermore, since ACE2, which may be regulated by clock activity, was shown to have a protective effect through suppression of apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells, it is possible that chronobiological interventions may mitigate the progression of lung injury, if such interventions occur in a very early stage of the infection [49]. Alternatively, in light of clinical studies showing the relevance of chronoadequacy of ACE inhibitor therapy on hypertension [50], it is possible that administration of such agents in the context of SARS-Cov-2 infection may require more precise alignment with the patient circadian clock status [51], even though the evidence supporting such pharmacological treatment is doubtful at best [52].",

As surface S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds protease domain of ACE2, virus attachment may directly compete with the processing of AngII to Ang(1\u20137), a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. AngII is known to be proinflammatory, while Ang(1\u20137) is anti-inflammatory. IFN-I signalling in the late phase of coronavirus infection induces exaggerated cytokine production and more severe lung injury. BMAL1 regulates IFN-I and chemokine CXCL5 production. AngII is known to affect the central clock system in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) through its effect on Per2 levels.",
