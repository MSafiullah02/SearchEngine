In order to determine the CD8+ T-cell reactive epitopes, four 9-mer peptides on D2 were synthesized based on the website computer program SYFPEITHI (Supplementary data 2 ) [15]. These peptides were predicted to be recognized by the H-2Kd MHC molecule. All four peptides were cultured with splenocytes, and the supernatants were then collected and analyzed by IFN-\u03b3 ELISA. The results showed that only peptide D2-1 could induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Fig. 4B). There was no significant difference in IFN-\u03b3 secretion between the CFA/IFA and ISA/CpG group (147 \u00b1 25 vs. 105 \u00b1 43). To further confirm that D2-1 was a MHC class I-restricted peptide, we used purified CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells to identify the responding T-cell subsets. The CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were separated using magnetic beads, which yielded a purity of the enriched T-cell subsets of greater than 90% (data not shown). Mitomycin C-treated na\u00efve splenocytes were added as antigen presenting cells. IFN-\u03b4\u03b4-secreting T-cells were analyzed by flowcytometry.

            "text": "SARS CoV spike protein plays very important functional roles during viral infection. Our approach to vaccine development in this study was to design peptides derived from different domains of the spike protein. This strategy is more efficient than using a single neutralizing epitope, since a peptide cocktail could potentially provide Th epitopes which enhance immune response. We used the peptide cocktail to immunize mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. In the mouse model we also used adjuvant ISA/CpG, which could potentially be used in a human vaccine, to study the immunogenicity of peptide vaccine candidates. In this study, we also identified a synthetic peptide D2 located at the receptor-binding region that contains both B cell and T-cell epitope in mice.",

Unexpectedly, we found that this region has low antigenicity in mice, but moderate antigenicity in guinea pigs and rabbits. The D1 peptide may therefore not be a good candidate for vaccine development. The ACE2 receptor-binding domain has been identified on the_SARS CoV spike protein (a.a. 318\u2013510) [16]. Furthermore, based on the crystal structure the minimum ACE2 receptor-binding motif on the spike protein has been suggested to be located at amino acid residue 424\u2013494 [4]. The D2 peptide (434\u2013467) is within the binding motif, and we found it to be both highly antigenic and immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. A neutralizing epitope located at amino acid residue 434\u2013453 was identified using a pseudovirus entry assay. Furthermore, our previous collaboration with Shih et al. also found a monoclonal antibody which could block pseudovirus entry has a binding epitope located in the same region (a.a. 434\u2013448) [14]. The importance of this region has been previously described by He et al. [17]\n[18] and Yi et al. [19]. These results indicate that D2 peptide could be a very good vaccine candidate.",

These results indicated that the ISA/CpG formulation could be used as an adjuvant in developing peptide-based vaccines. Our previous study found that the N protein from SARS CoV formulated with ISA and CpG could enhance immunogenicity, and the immune response was biased towards Th1 immunity [20]. In this study, we did not observe a similar immune response when peptides were formulated with ISA and CpG (data not shown). This may have been due to the need for a different CpG dose than for the N protein for the peptide to bias toward immune response. Further optimization of the CpG dose formulation in these peptide-based vaccines is needed.",
