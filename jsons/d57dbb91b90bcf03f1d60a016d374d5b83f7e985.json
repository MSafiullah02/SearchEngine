            "text": "Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If R 0 > 1, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if R 0 < 1 (e.g. due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growthdecays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.",

It is assumed here that recovered individuals do not return to susceptible class, that is, recovered individuals have immunity against the disease; they cannot become infected again and cannot infect susceptibles either. Analysis of this model is well-known [1, 2] and we will not discuss it here. Since the coronavirus epidemics is admittedly still in its early stage, let us only determine the condition of the disease progression at its beginning, i.e. when the number of infected/recovered/dead is much less than the number of susceptible, and hence S in the model above can be considered as constant, S \u2248 S 0 .

Thus, R 0 plays the key role in the epidemics development. In particular, one can change the course of the disease dynamics by changing R 0 . For instance, if measures are introduced that push the value ofR 0 below one (e.g. by making k to decrease), the exponential growth changes to exponential decay. Interestingly, this is exactly what has happened in South Korea (see Section 3) after restrictions on daily life were introduced. The classical SIR model therefore determines the condition of the disease development from the comparison of the disease transmission rate with the sum of the recover and death rates. In the other words, we compare the rates of adding and removal of infected. The model does not account for the incubation period of the disease that was shown to be important in the case of coronavirus spread: individuals can become infective before showing any symptoms. A model that allows for the incubation period will be considered in the next section.",

Note S 0 is a characteristic of the given population and \u03c4 is the property of the disease, therefore neither of them is controllable. However, parameter k depends on the human mobility and the social distance and can be changed.

The origin of the outbreak on February 12 (in China) is not clear yet. It may be related to the method of data collection. Daily reported cases curves in China and South Korea correspond to the growth-decay dynamics. The daily new cases curves for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, USA correspond to the growth mode. Note that the data on daily reported cases do not exactly correspond to the variable I(t). The latter represents a sum of daily cases during the incubation period.
