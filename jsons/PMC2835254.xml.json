This interaction of siRNA with TLRs depends greatly on siRNA structure and sequence, and it can be abrogated through sequence selection strategies and/or chemical modification of siRNA.27,28,29,30 Chemical modifications such as 2\u2032-fluoro pyrimidines and 2\u2032-O-methyl purines have been shown to prevent the IFN response.13 2\u2032-O-methyl substitutions to the ribose backbone in particular have been shown to suppress TLR7 and TLR8 interactions with immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs).30 It has been hypothesized that these modifications modulate binding of the TLR through structural conformational changes and affect hydrogen bonding in the minor groove of dsRNA.28",

We have recently established a combinatorial library of lipid-like materials for delivery of nucleic acids termed \u201clipidoids\u201d that can efficiently deliver small RNA's across cellular barriers.10 Using high-throughput screening methods, promising novel materials were previously identified that exhibited highly efficient in vitro and in vivo delivery of siRNA molecules to elicit RNAi-mediated downregulation of liver-specific targets. We further investigated the ability of siRNA delivered with one promising candidate material, 98N12-5(1), for its ability to suppress influenza A virus replication in the lung using a murine model of influenza infection. Using a new lipidoid nanoparticle formulation optimized to achieve antiviral effects, we describe the efficient prophylactic inhibition of influenza A in mouse lungs due to innate immune stimulation following the delivery of unmodified siRNA.",

We developed a method for generating stable nanoparticles of lipidoid with cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ceramide in sodium acetate and ethanol. Lipidoid was formulated, extruded at high pressure to normalize particle sizes, and then dialyzed to remove ethanol. These particles consistently exhibit a characteristic size of 70\u2013100 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering with >90% encapsulation of RNA (Supplementary Table S1). We investigated the use of dialyzed lipidoid nanoparticles for inhibition of the PR8 strain influenza A virus in a mouse model of infection. Initial studies with formulated 98N12-5(1) particles complexed with siNP-1496 indicated a dose-dependent response following prophylactic treatment 24 hours before infection with a super-lethal challenge of 12,000 plaque-forming units of PR/8 influenza virus. Up to 13-fold (~93%) reduction in lung viral titer compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections was observed at 3 mg/kg siNP-1496 dosing (Figure 2).

Upon lyophilization and reconstitution in PBS, lipidoid nanoparticles increased in size to between 400 and 700 nm (Supplementary Table S1). These larger particles were more efficient than nonlyophilized freshly prepared particles at suppressing influenza viral titer (Supplementary Figure S1). Extrusion of particles through a 400-nm filter resulted in similar sizes as extrusion through a 200-nm filter (data not shown). Extrusion of particles through a 400-nm filter followed by dialysis did not result in viral suppression as efficient as extrusion through a 200-nm filter followed by lyophilization. Compared to freshly prepared nanoparticles, lyophilization of lipidoid-siGFP-949 particles only slightly increased the antiviral effect at 3 mg/kg dose. Lyophilized nanoparticles at 3 mg/kg siRNA dosing reduced viral titer 13.4-fold (92.5%) for siGFP-949 and over 300-fold (99.7%) for siNP-1496 (Figure 2). However, at these highest doses lyophilized nanoparticles caused weight loss of 8% after the first injection and 16% after the second injection. At just 2 mg/kg dosing of siNP-1496, viral titer reduction with lyophilized particles was on average 36-fold (~97%) compared to PBS (Figure 2). This lyophilized formulation and 2 mg/kg dose was selected for the rest of our studies.",

Lyophilized lipidoid nanoparticles were formulated with siGFP-949, siNP-1496, or scrambled siNP-1496-sc. We also investigated serum IFN responses following dosing with nanoparticles, as some siRNA sequences are known to induce IFN responses through TLR7 in vivo in mice and TLR7/8 in vitro in human cells.25,41 We observed an association between efficient suppression of viral titers (Supplementary Figure S2a) and activation of an innate immune response (Supplementary Figure S2b) using the scrambled siNP-1496 sequence. In addition, viral inhibition in response to an irrelevant siRNA sequence (si\u03b2gal-728) known to induce IFN41 was similar in magnitude to that observed with siNP-1496 targeting the flu genome. Similar antiviral activity was observed as well with the sequence siPolyA/U, one strand of which (polyA strand) was reported to not stimulate immune responses when formulated with DOTAP42 (Table 1). Antiviral activity was compared side-by-side with siNP-1496 in lyophilized 98N12-5(1) nanoparticles. Surprisingly, siNP, si\u03b2gal, and siPolyA/U lipidoid particles all suppressed influenza reproduction equivalently, achieving over 90-fold reduction in viral titer compared to PBS controls (Figure 3b). Lipidoid nanoparticles containing both siNP and si\u03b2gal elicited high levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, while neither siGFP-nanoparticles nor PBS injections generated detectable levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 3b).",

Immune stimulation by modified siRNAs was first investigated in vitro by transfecting modified siRNA into cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with Gene Porter 2 or DOTAP. IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 levels of culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 24 hours after transfection (Figure 4). Incorporation of neither deoxythymidine overhangs nor substitution with a phosphorothioate linkage was able to prevent immune stimulation. Substituting the hydroxyl group on the 2\u2032 carbon of ribose with a 2\u2032-O-methyl group prevented immune stimulation when present on either sense or antisense strands in vitro (Figure 4). Just a single base (uridine) modification with 2\u2032-O-methyl could prevent immune stimulation, as the siRNA duplex formed with si4767 (sense) and si3590 (antisense) did not elicit immune stimulation (Figure 4). Chemically modified siRNAs retained the ability to inhibit influenza through RNAi mechanisms in vitro (Figure 5) with the IC50 of all duplexes in the sub-nmol/l range (<0.4 nmol/l). Notably, duplexes with the si3590-modified strand exhibited a slightly reduced potency with an IC50 approaching 1 nmol/l, though siRNA duplexes formed from more heavily 2\u2032-O-methyl substituted RNA strands such as si3589 did not suffer from this slight reduction in activity.",

While we did not observe significant anti-flu effect due to RNAi, large antiviral effect was caused by the immunostimulatory aspect of certain siRNA. The sense strand of the siNP-1496 sequence has been suggested to activate human PBMCs in vitro.30 Our findings are consistent with this report. The siRNA duplexes containing 3\u2032-overhangs with deoxythymidine showed immunostimulatory activity in vitro in human PBMCs (Figure 4) or when formulated and tested in vivo (Figure 6a). Further modification of the 3\u2032-overhangs with a phosphorothioate linkage also had little effect on siRNA-mediated immune activation. Only 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications were able to block IFN responses in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, only 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications blocked the in vivo antiviral response (Figure 6b). Previous reports have indicated that a minimum of two residues must be modified to prevent immune stimulation.30 We observed blockade of TLR activity with 2\u2032-O-methyl modification of just one central uridine residue (modified strand si3590; Table 2) in the antisense strand of the NP-1496 sequence that efficiently prevented IFN responses in human PBMCs (Figure 4). This central base modification also slightly decreased the potency of RNAi activity, although it was not eliminated (Figure 5), and was not further investigated in vivo. Interestingly, more extensive modification with multiple 2\u2032-O-methyl bases on the sense strand (si3589) molecule did not change RNAi potency. All of the other modifications completely preserved in vitro RNAi activity. While we did not directly test the immunostimulatory activity of our siRNAs in isolated mouse cells in vitro, we have observed similar immunostimulatory activity in vitro with human PBMCs and in vivo in mice consistent with other literature descriptions.25,30,41",

However, using a different formulation of 98N12-5(1), we have previously observed RNAi-mediated antiviral activity following direct pulmonary instillation in a mouse model of RSV infection.10 The formulation of 98N12-5(1) described here was optimized for maximum prophylactic effect, which was due to immunostimulatory delivery of RNA. It is possible that the relative contribution of RNAi-mediated gene silencing may be more significant for other delivery methods or other formulations of 98N12-5(1). Stably expressed siNP-1496 is capable of knocking down reporter gene expression (data not shown) and inhibiting influenza virus production in cell culture.16 The lack of observable in vivo RNAi mediated by formulations with siNP-1496 highlights the importance of siRNA delivery in achieving the desired RNAi activity.

As TLR7/8 activity is both cell-specific and compartmentalized to the late endosome, controlled delivery can influence the level of immunostimulatory siRNA activity. As TLR7/8 engagement is important for innate antiviral responses,28,35 avoiding TLRs is important in the development of RNAi therapies in the infectious disease setting. Additionally, excessive activity of TLR7/8 leading to increased type 1 IFN secretion from the pDC has been associated with autoimmunity.50 When siRNAs are administered in vivo they must therefore avoid sustained internalization into the endosome of pDCs and other TLR7/8-responsive cells, or siRNAs must be modified to prevent TLR7/8 activation as we have demonstrated. Nevertheless, an attractive therapeutic potential use of controlled siRNA delivery would be simultaneous RNAi activity and immunostimulatory RNA activity from the same RNA molecule.46 A single RNA with dual functionality may therefore be readily achieved by controlled delivery to a cytosolic location for RNAi activity and an endosomal location in pDCs for innate immune activation. We show that these antiviral IFN and related cytokine responses mediated by certain siRNAs in vivo can be influenced by delivery material and formulation and can be suppressed by chemical modifications to the siRNA.
