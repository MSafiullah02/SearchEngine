Adults residing in Brazil (n = 360, 37.9 years 25 of age, 68.9% female) were surveyed at the start of quarantine and 1 month later. Outcomes 26 assessed included perceived stress, state anxiety and depression. Aside from demographics, 27 behaviors and attitudes assessed included exercise, diet, use of tele-psychotherapy and number of 28 COVID-19 related risk factors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, information overload, and 29 feeling imprisoned. Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, 30 although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported 31 stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff 32 for depression and anxiety, respectively.

Historically, although 46 researchers from the biomedical sciences dedicated more time and resources in the study of 47 physical health, findings from the last 50 years have slowly captured the interest of scientists 48 from diverse fields to look upon mental health to explain somatic diseases, physical functioning, 49 quality-of-life, well-being and work productivity, (Christensen et al., 1999; Prince et al., 2007; 50 Stults-Kolehmainen, Tuit & Sinha, 2014) . For instance, mental health is associated with 51 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and premature mortality (Vigo, Kestel, Pendakur et al., 52 2019) with 17% of DALYs attributable to mental health in Brazil and 22% in the United States. 53",

These 66 impositions mean that people cannot walk freely from their homes; they need to keep a 2-meter 67 physical distance from one another on the streets and sick people are obliged to be confined in 68 hospitals or their own homes without any kind of physical proximity to others.

In linear regression, perceived stress was related to the 347 greatest number of exercise-related factors: exercise frequency per week, type of exercise and 348 perceived changes in exercise behaviour. Higher frequency of exercise (days/week) were 349 associated with less stress. However, the linear relationship between perceived stress and 350 exercise frequency was small (r = -.28), which is line with previous investigations (Stults-351 Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). It should be noted that 58.2% of the sample reported that they 352 perceived that their exercise behaviour changed with a month of quarantine (30.8% doing less 353 and 28.3% doing more), which follows the known phenomenon that stressful events can either 354 inhibit or activate changes in exercise behaviors (Stults-Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). 355 Furthermore, those who perceived that they exercised more frequently from Time 1 to Time 2 356 had less stress. Interestingly, of those very high for stress (< 2SD), 82% do no exercise at all, but 357 the remaining 18% complete 6 days a week of exercise.
