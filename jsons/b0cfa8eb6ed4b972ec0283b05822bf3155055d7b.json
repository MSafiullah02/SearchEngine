Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I 2 = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I 2 = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia. Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.

The underlying mechanisms were inferred as follows: (1) as weakly alkaline, chloroquine could increase endosomal pH therefore block virus infection [42, 44] ; (2) as spike (S) protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) blocker, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular SARS-CoV receptor thus inhibit virus attacking [4] ; (3) as immunomodulant, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could counteract pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [28, 45] . Unfortunately, the outcomes of hydroxychloroquine [37, 40] . Additionally, the hydroxychloroquine therapy improved more radiographical benefit [28] , despite accompanied with more AEs especially diarrhea [40] . Up to date, we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.",

Furthermore, lopinavir/ritonavirbased therapies documented notably better clinical and radiographical improvement and reduced incidence of ARDS or intubation. Take adverse reactions into consideration, most of the AEs rate were comparable between groups. Conversely, lopinavir/ritonavir alone showed tendency of more diarrhea events, while the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids reduced incidence of diarrhea significantly.

The meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results for mortality with RR of between 0.38 and 0.82, while the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids showed remarkable lower mortality J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f compared with control group. In addition, patients treated with ribavirin-based therapies showed comparable rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation with control group. Of note, the major problem of ribavirin was significantly higher incidence of adverse events especially bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis compared with control group. Intriguingly, the combination of ribavirin and interferon did not observe these problems. Summarily, as the inconsistent benefit, considerable safety concerns, and very low quality of evidence, it was hard to make a clear recommendation for the use of ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations for COVID-19.",

However, the arbidol alone generated equivalent outcome in patients with COVID-19 compared with control group, while the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir showed better efficacy [27] . Furthermore, interferon had been widely used through SARS and MERS epidemic [18] , and there were 5 studies reported combinations with interferon. Unfortunately, no difference was noted between treatment and control group in terms of mortality, intubation rate, and adverse reactions. The recommendation of these treatments was uncertain because of the small sample size of study and other risk of low quality [12, 27, 36] .",

Secondly, it objectively and rigorously assessed the efficacy outcomes (mortality, virological eradication, clinical improvements, etc.) and safety outcomes (AEs, leukopenia, anemia, diarrhea, bradycardia, etc.) of current anti-coronavirus therapies for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with similar definitions of outcomes across studies. Moreover, we evaluated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the quality of the evidence in the meta-analyses by implementing the GRADEpro in attempt to verify the strength of the recommendation. On the other hand, there were some limitations among included literatures. First of all, some outcomes included a small sample size of patients, such as clinical improvement, radiographical improvement, and leukopenia, causing imprecision of outcomes thus downgraded the quality of evidence. Secondly, the open-label design of most RCTs included in this meta-analysis also restricted the quality grade of effects. Thirdly, the variations in timing of treatment, dosage, administration route and co-treatments might influence our results. For an instance, one study administrated hydroxychloroquine approximately 16 days after symptoms onset, while the time between onset of symptoms and inclusion (hydroxychloroquine initiation) were 0 to 10 days in another study. The virological eradication results were quite difference between these two studies. However, we could not perform further subgroup analysis considering these influenced factors because of the limited number of studies. Finally, the diversity of indications might add heterogeneity to results. Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were closely related with SARS-CoV, the results might not be directly extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Thus, further research would be required to confirm our findings. Given the latter strengths and limitations, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles.

In subgroup analysis, ribavirin combined with corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapies and hydroxychloroquine showed some benefit in different outcomes. However, considering the very low quality of evidence, the heterogeneity of interventions and indications, we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19. Our results may allow clinicians to comprehensively understand the property of each anti-coronavirus agent on efficacy and safety outcomes and thus may constitute a basis of drug treatment for COVID-19. Certainly, it was of utmost necessity to conduct large-scale clinical trials to objectively assess the efficacy of antiviral treatment on the mortality, virological and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections.ContributionsZhi-Chun Gu was responsible for the study design.

Therefore, we decided to downgrade the quality of evidence as risk of bias. 7 There is serious heterogeneity among the studies included in the analysis of intubation and mechanical ventilation (I 2 = 67.8%). Overall, we decided to downgrade by one level when considering these issues along with inconsistency. 8 There is serious heterogeneity among the studies included in the analysis of AEs (I 2 = 71.0%). Overall, we decided to downgrade by one level when considering these issues along with inconsistency. 9 There is serious heterogeneity among the studies included in the analysis of anemia (I 2 = 53.3%). Overall, we decided to downgrade by one level when considering these issues along with inconsistency. 10 There is serious heterogeneity among the studies included in the analysis of diarrhea (I 2 = 73.2%). Overall, we decided to downgrade by one level when considering these issues along with inconsistency. 11 The effect was large (RR >2) in analysis of bradycardia. Therefore, we decided to upgrade the quality of evidence as large magnitude of effect.",
