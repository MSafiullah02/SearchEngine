            "text": "Though President Lincoln recognized the immorality of slavery, preservation of the Union was his priority entering the Civil War. Freedom for the enslaved black Americans was only incorporated when he recognized its strategic value. He was subsequently dedicated to making the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery nationwide (except as punishment for crime) an integral part of his Republican Party\u2019s 1864 reelection plan and to getting it through Congress as quickly as possible (Current, n.d.). This was to safeguard the freedom his January 1, 1863 Emancipation Proclamation granted enslaved persons in Confederate controlled states. However, Lincoln\u2019s prior priority was in alignment with most politicians\u2019 perspective. Then, his assassination put Andrew Johnson, a Southern Democrat, into the White House. Together, these resulted in an uphill battle for the radical Republican minority, who wanted a comprehensive Reconstruction of the southern states that supported the rights and well-being of both races (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.c). Unfortunately, the resolution of the disputed 1876 presidential election eroded the radical Republican minority\u2019s party-influence as well as their political and military power in the South (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.c).\n",

This was met with resistance from the Redemption Movement starting in 1872. The group used voting manipulations, lowering of taxes and physical violence to undermine the progress made by the interracial coalition (Barber 2018).",

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded in 1909 by an interracial group after vicious race riots in Springfield Illinois; W. E. B Du Bois, whose 1905 Niagara Movement was an inspiration, was the only black executive member (NAACP, n.d.a). Headquartered in New York City, the NAACP utilized legislation and publicity to effect change. The National Urban League was founded in 1910 (National Urban League, n.d.). The New Negro Movement, which was a multi-aspect re-imagination of the black identity influenced by black Americans\u2019 experience in World War I, included the Harlem Renaissance and saw the rise of leaders with a range of ideologies. These leaders included Marcus Garvey of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and A Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porter (Cunningham 1996). The second decade of the twentieth century also saw the first wave of the Great Migration of southern black Americans seeking to escape segregation and its economic limitations by moving north (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.b). Founded in 1942, Congress of Racial Equality was an interracial organization that embraced direct-action projects and Mohandas K. Gandhi\u2019s\n2 nonviolence to end segregation and improve race relations (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.a).",

Roosevelt (1941) to issue an executive order opening defense jobs to people of all races (Clayborne, n.d.; NAACP, n.d.a.). President Roosevelt also established the Fair Employment Practices Committee to ensure adherence to the executive order (NAACP, n.d.a). Inspired by the experience of equality aboard and angered by the discrimination within the armed forces, veterans added a new vigor to the civil rights movement; Medgar Evers, active in the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (founded 1951) and the NAACP, was a veteran (Clayborne, n.d.; NAACP, n.d.b; Ownby 2018).",

The peaceful race relations MLK experienced in the northern state of Connecticut the summer before entering Morehouse College, Georgia, had a great impact on the fifteen year old (King 1998).

An early mentor was Morehouse\u2019s President Benjamin Mays, who prioritized action for gospel-inspired social justice (Lewis and Clayborne 2019).",

This decision mushroomed into a clergy supported movement that saw MLK, who was a member of the Alabama Council on Human Relations and the local NAACP chapter, elected as the inaugural president of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) (King 1998). MLK\u2019s reflections on the public\u2019s debate of the bus boycott led him to conceptualize the campaign as a nonviolent choice to not cooperate with an evil structure (King 1998). He also realized that \u201cChrist furnished the spirit and motivation while Gandhi furnished the method\u201d (King 1998, 67). Up to that point, MLK had struggled with how love could be a transformative force socially as well as interpersonally (King 1998). During this campaign, he worked out his principles for nonviolent living3 as presented in his first book \u201cStride Towards Freedom: The Montgomery Story\u201d (1958, 90\u201395). This book is a reflection on the year-long bus boycott campaign that claimed victory on November 13, 1956, when the Supreme Court (Browder v. Gavie) ruled bus segregation in Montgomery and Alabama unconstitutional.",

Therefore, his support of BIG was not a stand-alone issue and ultimately sought to benefit all peoples everywhere.

            "text": "\nMLK was a theologian, philosopher and an ordained minister, who identified the interrelated triple evils of poverty, racism and militarism empirically when he realized the Vietnam War was debilitating President Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty (King 1986c). Thus, he considered his evolution to including economic inequality in the work to end the adverse effects of racism as a turn to human rights. However, Harman (2017), a historian, formulated a view of the origination of the triple evils that reveals economic rights are civil rights. Harman argues that class society developed when humankind transitioned from roving hunter-gatherer communities to become settled producers who developed large-scale production. In the former arrangement, the hunters provided meat, which was a treat, and the gatherers provided the staples. Both groups needed and valued each other. In the newer large-scale arrangement, the managers of the resultant surplus, who were also the planners of production, began to think their contribution was more important even as they recognized their dependence on those who actually produced the surplus. Harman holds the managers\u2019 response was to develop class society, economic inequality and supporting ideologies.8 He also documents the emergence of the military at this point. From this perspective, it becomes clear that the 1960s racism and militarism were the contemporary enforcers of an unjust economic order and that poverty itself is the primal civil injustice because structuring society in this way prevents the people whose work directly creates the wealth from receiving an equitable share of the profits generated together. Economic inequality then prevents them from participating fully in society\u2019s economic sphere. The latter became more significant as financial and economic structures increased in sophistication.",

            "text": "The distinction of economic exploitation as the originator of an oppressive class society is very important as it highlights the value of MLK\u2019s founding his political activism for BIG on a call for a revolution of values tied to the restructuring of American society with the Beloved Community/ world house as the end point. Closely aligned with this is his preference for a dynamic BIG tied to the median income level. Firstly, MLK was identifying the cause of poverty and seeking to address this cause. Secondly, ontologically, BIG is a community process9; this reality is demonstrated by the fact that the institution that has come closest to enacting BIG is the family, which is an embodiment of \u201cus.\u201d Therefore, it is reasonable to expect BIG would not be sustainable in a society founded on division. Thirdly, as a review of the legislative history of divisive issues, from abortion to welfare benefits or voting rights, substantiates, legislation alone does not work to effect lasting change. This is because, as Covey (2004) rightly emphasizes, actions flow from one\u2019s worldview or perception of reality. Thus, sustainable socioeconomic or political change is predicated on the prior inner transformation of a significant segment of society. So in calling for a revolution of values to restructure American society, MLK identified a means of attaining sustainable economic change. Fourthly, the revolution of values goes beyond political or religious ideology, which can be hard to bridge, to a deeply personal area that informs an individual\u2019s daily life while facilitating a sense of belonging in local and national communities. These characteristics of values are the very things that make MLK\u2019s justifications of peace and justice, fulfillment of the nation\u2019s promise and humankind\u2019s self-actualization potentially desirable to a very large segment of the population and capable of facilitating transformation into the world house\u2019s ethic of \u201ca worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one\u2019s tribe, race, class, and nation\u201d to \u201can all-embracing and unconditional love for all men\u201d that ultimately \u201cpreserve[s] the best in our individual societies\u201d (King 1964). Finally, the quantitative particulars of MLK\u2019s BIG would have effected socioeconomic restructuring by providing a secure middle-class income as society\u2019s lowest financial threshold via the dignified means of work or an unconditional regular payment.",

Direct action, the fifth step of this methodology, was used successfully in obtaining the 1964 and 1965 legislative victories as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s desegregation of the Alabama bus system. Direct action is meant to introduce creative tension into the negotiations and move the other party toward the desired outcome (King Center, n.d.).

The combination of these factors possibly explains the response from the press, the government, the FBI, the sharp difference in race-related support for the campaign documented in the June 1968 survey and the small turn out for Solidarity Day: limited identification and possibly race-based fear. Further, in setting the PPC, the task of actualizing America\u2019s promise, MLK was in the realm of fostering a new national identity and social compact. He was attempting a transition from the existing social conflict theory arrangement with its inequity and class conflicts to a humanistic model with an emphasis on the value of the individual and his/her capacity for freely chosen actualization and value-based living (Hutchison 2015).

It was cited in John Kenneth Galbraith and colleagues\u2019 influential BIG petition. Further, MLK\u2019s work is inspiring a new generation of BIG activists, even if, like Andrew Yang, some have different justifications. It is also very encouraging that Hawk Newsome is supporting BIG in his official capacity as a young MCRM leader, especially as BIG is not in alignment with his organization\u2019s priorities. This is a welcome development for BIG activists, given the PPC:ANCMR\u2019s choice to favor a right to work over BIG. This choice brings the MCRM into a debate that has been active since the 1980s (Harvey 2004) and can be considered a fracturing of the MCRM on the level of Stokely Carmichael\u2019s15 choosing Black Power over the commitment to nonviolence and eventual reconciliation with white Americans. This is such a splintering of the movement because by choosing a guaranteed job and fully funded welfare programs, they are abandoning MLK\u2019s mission to restructure the system that causes beggars. For fully funded welfare programs, even if achieved through the poor having a voice in the policy formulation and political processes, result in a mere rearrangement of the current system. They are also walking away from the potential for sustainable socioeconomic change particular to MLK\u2019s justifications for BIG and the quantitative specifics of the BIG he supported. However, this is not surprising as MLK\u2019s support of BIG is linked to his nonviolent philosophy and the end goal of the Beloved Community/ world house. While the PPC:ANCMR utilizes MLK\u2019s language and ideas, it has not included the Beloved Community/ world house as the ultimate goal. Also, while MLK developed nonviolence as a way of life that cultivates peace regardless of the personal cost, nonviolence is listed as the last of the PPC:ANCMR\u2019s twelve fundamental principles (King 1964; PPC:ANCMR, n.d.). And the principle of nonviolence is presented in a manner tht could be interpreted primarily as a rejection of violent behavior. This occurrence in the Modern Civil\u2019s Rights Movement\u2019s approach to economic justice makes development of MLK\u2019s work even more important.",

            "text": "The intensification of the triple evils is another reason for further advancement of MLK\u2019s thought, particularly those associated with BIG and economic injustice. Putnam (2013a, b) identifies the three big trends in American society from the 1980s to the present as severe income inequality, social class segregation and a loss of the sense of community that translate to less opportunity for poor children. For Putnam, it is a deviation from the core of the American Dream/Promise that each young person would have an equal start and subsequent success would be based on the individual\u2019s efforts. Putnam (2016) is equally concerned that the increased segregation and inequality will adversely impact the country\u2019s economy and social character since American society is designed to function with a high level of social capital/trust. The trends are not just in the USA. Freelander and Taibbi (2012) recognize the same movement toward economic inequality across western societies. And in his 2015 encyclical Laudato si\u2019: On Care for Our Common Home, Pope Francis (2015) identifies society\u2019s many ills, global and local, as stemming from the globalization of the dichotomizing, profit-prioritizing \u201c technocratic paradigm\u201d that fails to even acknowledge the inherent value and form of the other. Thus, there is continued need for a revolution of values that would restructure society nationally and internationally. If the new way chosen is that of the Beloved Community/ world house, BIG is an integral part of it. The inverse is equally true: as already discussed, BIG cannot be sustainably achieved without including political activism founded on Dr. King\u2019s entire philosophy. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic that laid bear humanity\u2019s indisputable interdependence highlights these reciprocal truth. Therefore, the pandemic has the potential to be a catalyst for action towards MLK\u2019s expanded dream.",
