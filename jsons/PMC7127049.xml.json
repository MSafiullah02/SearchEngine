An intermolecular quadruplex is formed by guanine runs present in two or four different nucleic acid strands. Adjacent guanines in a G-tetrad are connected via hydrogen bonds on their Hoogsteen faces [1]. The loop sequences (Nx, Ny, and Nz) connect the G-runs. Motifs with loop sequences that are over seven nucleotides long can also form G4s, albeit in a context-dependent manner 2, 3.",

            "text": "The transient formation of G4s under thermodynamically favorable conditions has important regulatory roles dictated by the genomic location. G4s are ubiquitously found in the telomeres of eukaryotes [4]. The formation of G4s by the G-rich telomeric repeats inhibits extension of telomeres by telomerase; thus stabilization of G4s in telomeres with ligands represents a potential anticancer strategy [5]. Nearly 50% of human genes have a G4 motif in their promoter region [6]. Importantly, oncogenes like c-Myc, VEGF [7], and KRAS [8] are negatively regulated by their promoter-borne G4s [5]. G4 structures can also form in RNA. Quadruplexes formed in the 5\u2032 UTR of the mRNA inhibit cap-dependent translation (e.g., NRAS and BCL-2) and enhance IRES-mediated cap-independent translation (e.g., hVEG-F and FGF2) 9, 10. Besides, G4s also influence other molecular mechanisms in RNA biology such as splicing, ribosomal frameshifting, mRNA localization, repeat-associated non-AUG(RAN) translation, and maturation of miRNAs (reviewed in [10]). Furthermore, formation of an intermolecular hybrid quadruplex (HQ) between nontemplate DNA and nascent mRNA acts as a transcription-termination signal [10]. In addition to gene expression, the spatial association of quadruplex motifs with the recombination hotspots in the human genome implicates quadruplexes in recombination [11].",

The surface proteins of some pathogens are continuously altered by antigenic and phase variation to overcome host adaptive immune responses. Besides sequence mutation and natural competence to DNA transformation [19], the molecular basis of antigenic variation (Av) also involves recombination of genomic segments leading to the production of altered surface proteins [20].

Conventionally, Av by gene conversion involves the unidirectional transfer of genetic segments from the donor loci, a tandem array of silent alleles of the surface protein, to a downstream recipient locus that actively expresses the gene encoding the surface protein; this process is assisted by recombinases. Pili are hair-like appendages made up of pilin proteins which are present on the bacterial cell surface and exhibit Av. In N. gonorrhoeae, it has been demonstrated experimentally that the G4 formed near the pilE, a pilin-expression locus, binds RecA and provides a topological advantage for the nicking process essential to initiate recombination [26].

Symptoms of malaria appear in about a week after exposure when the parasite enters red blood cells (RBCs) and digests hemoglobin [27]. Proteins of the PfEMP-1 family are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes during the asexual life cycle in man and are encoded by var, a family of 60 genes which are predominantly present in the subtelomeric region of chromosomes [28]. The var genes undergo recombination (indels and translocations) to facilitate sequence variation in PfEMP1 and immune evasion. Interestingly, about a quarter of all putative quadruplex motifs in the P. falciparum genome are associated with the promoters of the var genes [29]. Stanton et al. identified a close association between the recombination breakpoints and G4 motifs in P. falciparum\n[30]. Breakpoints were found to occur proximal to quadruplexes, especially in subtelomeic regions, indicating that G4s have a role in var-associated recombination. Although recombination in P. falciparum genomes occurred proximal to quadruplex motifs, the median distance of a G4 from a breakpoint was about 16 kb. The specific mechanisms underlying G4-assisted var gene recombination are not fully understood; nonetheless, a potential role for DNA repair has been speculated.",

            "text": "In addition to contributing to antigenic diversity in microbes (discussed above), G4s facilitate generation of genetic heterogeneity and evolution of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. The recombination rate of HIV-1 stems from the ability of the reverse transcriptase (RT) to switch between RNA templates and generate chimeric proviral DNA. Recombinant HIV-1 strains have been associated with increased transmission efficiency and resistance to anti-HIV therapy [31]. The two positive-sense RNA strands of HIV-1 are held together by hairpin loops in the dimerization site (DIS) at the 5\u2032 end of each of the RNAs [32]. This allows for strand transfer by RT, making the region a recombination hotspot. Similar to the hairpin loops, intermolecular G4s tether the recombining segments, thus bringing them into each other\u2019s proximity to promote initiation of recombination. Independent studies identified intermolecular G4 motifs in three regions of the HIV-1 RNA (i) a 130-nt region comprising the DIS and 5\u2032 portion of the gag, (ii) central polypurine tract (cPPT), and (iii) the U3 region on either termini of RNA 33, 34, 35, 36. Under in vitro conditions, synthetic RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to these G4s caused pausing of RT in the presence of potassium ions. Moreover, in an in vitro strand transfer assay, efficient switching over of RT between templates was observed under conditions that promote quadruplex formation (presence of potassium ions). These studies suggest that quadruplexes allow for dimerization of the HIV-1 genome at multiple loci along its length, thus contributing to recombinogenicity and rapid evolution of HIV-1.",

Herpesvirus genes are divided into immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) based on the time at which they are expressed in the replication cycle. IE genes act as trans-activators or trans-repressors of the E and L genes. IE genes are expressed within a few hours of virus entry into the host cells.

Interestingly, two-tetrad quadruplexes were identified in the same genomic regions (i.e., E1, E2/E4 and LCR) of manatee papilloma viruses [52]. In papilloma viruses, the LCR contains a number of cis-acting regulatory elements for virus replication and transcription that play a role in determining tissue tropism [53]. The early proteins (E1\u2013E7) are nonstructural proteins and have pivotal roles in the modulation of the host regulatory network while the late proteins (L1, L2) are required for virion assembly [54].

Interestingly, SUD was identified to bind G-runs and the more ordered G4s, in both DNA and RNA [56]. The G4-binding property is mapped to the M domain nested within the SUD and is indispensable for the replication and transcription of the virus [57]. Putative G-rich targets of SUD include host mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate key cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation.

Multiple reiterations of G-rich repeat units capable of forming G4s (known as \u2018repetitive G-quadruplex motifs\u2019 \u2013 RGQMs) has been noted in the eight HHVs [44]. Such G4-forming repeats have recently been identified to be functionally relevant in the latency of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or HHV-8. KSHV is an oncogenic virus that has acquired a number of its genes by molecular piracy. The terminal repeat (TR) region of KSHV genome is enriched for quadruplex-forming sequence motifs with each repetitive element (about 800 bp), having 12 and 16 putative quadruplex-forming sequences in the top and the bottom strand respectively [60]. The TR region harbours the only origin for replication of viral episomes. The preponderance of quadruplexes in the TR region is relevant in the regulation of episomal replication. Stabilization of the G4s with PhenDC3 (2,N9-bis(1-methylquinolin-3-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxamide) or TmPyP4 (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridin-1-ium-4-yl)-21,22-dihydroporphyrin) halts the replication forks at the boundary of the TR; replicative stress ensues and results in the firing of the otherwise dormant origins in the viral episome. Consequently, the two replication parameters \u2013 the number of replication forks and the number of origins \u2013 increase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a transient replication assay also indicated inhibition of KSHV DNA replication and a decrease in the number of copies of the viral episome, post-treatment with PhenDC3 (Figure 4C). Interestingly, even upon removal of the ligand, the number of KSHV genome copies was lower as compared to that in cells without the ligand, indicating reduction of virus episomes.",

Interestingly, the level of the EBV oncogene, EBNA-1, is maintained by the folding and unfolding dynamics of its mRNA-borne quadruplex. The segment of EBNA1 mRNA that encodes its glycine\u2013alanine repeat (GAr) domain was found to be rich in G4 motifs. Polysome distribution profiling, in vitro translation, and cell culture experiments identified that formation of quadruplexes obstructs the progress of ribosome machinery, resulting in low levels of EBNA1 and a concomitant decrease in presentation to T cells (Figure 4D). In addition, nucleolin was identified to bind the G4 formed in the GAr domain of EBNA-1 mRNA [66]. This interaction limits the synthesis of EBNA-1 to levels that allow persistence of the virus and evasion of the host immune system. Mutation of the EBNA-1 mRNA quadruplex or absence of nucleolin resulted in alleviation of translation inhibition and increased presentation of EBNA-1.",

The HBV genome exhibits a high degree of genetic variability owing to the lack of proof-reading ability in the HBV reverse transcriptase. As a result, HBV is classified into 10 HBV genotypes (A through J) with an intergenotypic sequence variation of at least 8% [84]. The HBV genotypes differ in transmissibility, virus loads, response to antiviral therapy, and ability to cause liver disease 84, 85. However, genotype-specific regulatory mechanisms in HBV remain elusive. We had recently identified a G4 motif as a genotype-specific regulator of HBV replication [40]. A conserved three-tetrad G4 motif, 190 bp upstream of the transcription start site, was identified in the preS2/S promoter of HBV genotype B. This motif was virtually absent in the rest of the HBV genotypes. This quadruplex specifically enhanced the transcription of the preS2/S transcript and the production of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Point mutations disrupting the G4 motif in the preS2/S promoter of HBV genotype B led to a reduction in HBsAg production resulting in a fivefold reduction in virion secretion [26].",

This nitrate-assimilatory system (nas) is regulated by a two-component NasS\u2013NasT system. NasT is an effector molecule that positively regulates transcription of nas genes by acting as an antitermination signal [88]. The GC-rich genome of P. denitrificans contains a three-tetrad quadruplex motif 150 nucleotides upstream of the nasT gene [89]. Stabilization of the G4 by ligands (TmPyP4 and a benzophenoxazine ligand) or by cations (KCl) inhibited the transcription of the nasT gene. Similarly, the presence of G4-stabilizing ligands inhibited the growth of P. denitrificans in media containing nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen.

Mitochondrial transcripts of kinetoplastid organisms undergo extensive editing post-transcription; this mRNA editing involves deletion or insertion of \u2018U\u2019 residues at multiple locations specified by the anchoring of guide RNAs (gRNAs) encoded by the mitochondrial genome [91]. The nucleotide composition of the pre-mRNAs may be potentially altered by up to 50% as a result of editing, which is referred to as pan-editing [92]. Matthias-Leeder et al. analyzed nine mRNAs of T. brucei and found that the guanosine (G) content is lowered to about 19% from about 34% during pan-editing [93]. Importantly, the authors used computational methods to demonstrate the progressive decrease in G4 content during pan-editing. Therefore, pan-editing in African trypanosomes has been suggested as a G4-resolving process that leads to the generation of G4-free translatable ORFs. The authors also propose the formation of DNA/RNA hybrid G4s (HQ) between the nontemplate DNA strand and pre-edited transcripts. Furthermore, it is speculated that the formation of HQs is involved in the termination of transcription and the initiation of mitochondrial replication. Thus, quadruplexes may play a crucial role in switching between the two mutually exclusive processes of mitochondrial replication and transcription in trypanosomes.",

It would be interesting to understand if such interactions defend the host or demonstrate yet another mechanism of microbial pathogenesis. Intuitively, the threshold to transcend the thin line between these two opposing outcomes may be subject to complex regulation which may be important for an understanding of the therapeutic potential of targeting this host\u2013microbe interaction.",

Recently, i-motifs were visualized in human cells [100]. It may be particularly interesting to study the molecular dynamics of G4s and i-motifs and its impact on microbial pathogenesis and evolution.Outstanding QuestionsDo G4-unwinding helicases encoded by the host interact with G4s in pathogens during infection? If so, are such host\u2013microbe interactions double-edged swords that help the host to defend some infections and prove to be detrimental in others? It may also be interesting to study if pathogens modulate the expression profile of host-encoded G4 helicases during infections.Do G4s represent structural elements for conservation of energy in bacterial metabolism? Is G4-mediated control of gene expression exercised only in the early stages of central dogma to conserve energy? Are the prokaryotic ORFs devoid of G4s to cut down on the energy cost of resolution of G4 for translation? Does the presence of G4s as an additional level of coordinated gene control in operons also signify the same?As in D. radiodurans, are the unique adaptations of other extremophiles regulated by G4s?The primary sequence of viruses coevolves with that of their hosts. Nonetheless, it is not known whether nucleic acid secondary structures, such as G4s, in virus genomes coevolve with host genomes.As in Nostoc spp. and Xanthomonas spp., are the plasmids of other bacteria also devoid of G4s? Given that plasmids harbor important bacterial genes needed for virulence, antibiotic resistance etc., and the ability of G4s to pause replication, are they selectively eliminated from extrachromosomal elements to minimize interference, if any, in vertical transmission?Do the pathogenicity islands in bacterial genomes have unique G4 profiles?Are the differences in the density and distribution of G4s in pathogens influenced by the ecological relationship they share with the host? In other words, are there differences in the genomic densities of G4s among parasites, symbionts, commensals, and mutualists?\n",

Addition of G4-binding ligand (blue) further augments the inhibition of gene expression. (B) HHV genomes exist as concatemers during replication. A quadruplex formed at the pac-1 signal (packaging signal) acts as a scaffold for the protein machinery that cleaves and encapsidates unit-length genomes. The sites of cleavage proximal to the quadruplex-forming pac-1 signals are shown in orange. (C) Binding of ligands (blue objects) to G4s (red triangular kinks) present near the origin of bidirectional episomal replication (red bulge with two-headed arrow) in the terminal repeat region (red portion) of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episome, prevents progression of DNA polymerase (green ovals). The slippage of the polymerase leads to replicative stress that activates dormant origins (grey bulges on either sides). The net effect of the ligand binding to quadruplexes is a reduction in the number of KSHV episomal copies. (D) Quadruplex (red) formed in the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) mRNA causes stalling of the ribosome-nascent chain complex (green and blue), resulting in inhibition of translation. EBV is thus able to maintain the levels of EBNA-1 below the detection threshold, evading immune response during latency. The binding of nucleolin (orange) to the quadruplex further reduces EBNA-1 protein levels. (E) Ligands (blue objects) bind to G4s (red) in the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) genome and stabilize them, causing polymerase (green ovals) stalling on the leading and lagging strands, inhibiting HSV-1 DNA replication.
