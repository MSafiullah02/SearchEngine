The expression of HBGAs is determined by 3 gene families expressing the ABO (A/B enzymes), secretor (FUT2) gene, and Lewis-type (FUT3) gene. Single nucleotide gene polymorphisms can inactivate the expression of these gene products, thereby breaking a link in the norovirus binding and infection process. Mutations in the FUT2 gene leading to the absence of HBGA expression (nonsecretor phenotype) have been associated with resistance to infection, in particular to GII.4 noroviruses, which are the predominant global genotype.85, 86, 88, 89, 93, 94, 95, 96 HGBA expression appears to vary by ethnicity; 20% to 25% of the US. white population consists of nonsecretors compared with 2% of persons of Meso-American or Hispanic ancestry.

Case management depends on accurate and rapid assessment of the severity of dehydration, correction of fluid loss and electrolyte disturbances, and maintenance of adequate hydration and nutrition.113 Treatment with oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing appropriate glucose-electrolyte solutions is sufficient for most patients. ORS use a protein sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGALT1) that facilitates solute absorption across the luminal membrane. Water passively follows the osmotic gradient generated by transcellular transport of electrolytes and nutrients. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended use of low-osmolarity ORS (245 mOsm/L), which has been shown to decrease stool output and vomiting in comparison with children treated with traditional ORS (311 mOsm/L). Intravenous rehydration can be required for children with severe dehydration (\u226510% fluid deficit, shock, or near shock), intractable vomiting, or ORS treatment failure. Factors such as young age, unusual irritability or drowsiness, progressive course of symptoms, or uncertainty of diagnosis can indicate a need for close observation.",

Evidence on the use of oral probiotics (e.g., Lactobacillus spp.) to reduce the duration of diarrhea caused by rotavirus is conflicting.115, 116, 117 Zinc, used both as supplement and treatment, reduces the severity, duration, and incidence of diarrhea in low- to middle-income settings and is considered one of the mainstays of treatment in developing countries118, 119; however, the role of zinc supplementation in high-income settings has not been extensively studied. Because viral agents account for most cases of infectious gastroenteritis in children, antimicrobial therapy is not usually indicated for children (see Chapter 55).120\n",

These include rotaviruses, noroviruses, enteric adenoviruses (types 40 and 41), astroviruses, and sapoviruses.\u2022Viral gastroenteritis occurs in endemic and epidemic forms. Rotaviruses and noroviruses are the major causes of endemic disease, with seasonal peaks during the winter months in temperate climates. Noroviruses are the main causes of epidemic disease.\u2022Following introduction of rotavirus vaccine, rates of rotavirus gastroenteritis have decreased substantially, and currently noroviruses are the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in the United States.\nClinical Features\n\u2022The clinical characteristics of illnesses caused by different viruses generally are indistinguishable. These include watery diarrhea and, in some cases, vomiting and fever.\u2022The most common severe complication of viral gastroenteritis is dehydration, often with electrolyte abnormalities.\u2022Prolonged diarrhea has been reported among children with malnutrition and among immunocompromised patients.\nDiagnosis\n\u2022Laboratory diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis is best made by detection of viral antigen or nucleic acid in fresh, whole stool samples obtained during the acute illness.\u2022Commercially available assays to detect rotavirus antigen in stools offer an easy and inexpensive method to diagnose infection in children.\nTreatment\n\u2022No specific therapies are available for viral gastroenteritis.\u2022The mainstays of therapy include assessment of dehydration severity, correction of fluid loss and electrolyte disturbances, and maintenance of adequate nutrition.\u2022Oral rehydration using oral rehydration solution with appropriate glucose-electrolyte solutions is sufficient for most patients.\u2022Zinc is used for treatment in low-income countries.\nPrevention\n\u2022Rotavirus vaccines have been added to routine immunization programs in more than 75 countries and have substantially reduced diarrhea-associated healthcare use and acute gastroenteritis-associated mortality rates.\u2022Except for rotavirus, prevention of viral gastroenteritis is limited to nonspecific strategies including breastfeeding, hand hygiene, and strict adherence to hygiene guidelines including use of Environmental Protection Agency\u2013approved cleaners for food preparation areas and contaminated surfaces.\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",
